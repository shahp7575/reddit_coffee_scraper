Hindi ba talaga possible for 2 people 'yung ganitong monthly budget dahil sa halaga ng mga bilihin ngayon, or nag-ooversplurge lang kami on certain things? What items can we cut down or substitute to reduce costs?  Are there any better shopping strategies (e.g., where to buy certain items, shopping frequency)? Any tips for effective meal planning and budgeting?

For context, we plan to buy vegetables from the palengke and purchase the rest from supermarkets. Also, the estimated costs were based on the prices from South Supermarket on the Pickaroo grocery delivery app. Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!

1hx2od9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hx2od9/friend_was_making_me_uncomfortable_with_her/,Friend was making me uncomfortable with her sexual comments and when I asked her to stop she blocked me. Worried about repercussions at work,"TLDR; woman I was friends with would make sexual comments towards me and when I asked her to stop she blocked. Now I'm worried about a sexual harassment investigation at work when it wasn't my fault.

So, I'll try to keep this brief but I'm pissed. I made a friend at my work. She's 20+ years older than me (me 34 her 55+) and I viewed her as a mother figure after I just lost my mom. She was pretty supportive of me and it was nice being friends with her as I had someone to talk to. She'd help me go to my appointments as I didn't have a car or anything and for a bit we watched movies together. She's married so I didn't think anything of it.

Early on in our friendship she said that she liked to flirt and joke around sexually but it meant nothing. I took that under consideration and said that if she said anything that made me uncomfortable I would let her know. 

Well, things started to take a more uncomfortable turn. She confided in me that she wasn't sexually satisified with her husband. She has a much higher sex drive than him and he just likes to play video games. Because of this she had an affair before. I didn't judge and I understood where she was coming from.

Then she started to make comments that made me uncomfortable. We were hanging out at the mall one day and she bought me a coffee and told me, ""if I buy this for you are you going to put out?"" It made me feel really gross. Next I was telling her about something funny that I did with my ex around sex and this woman responded, ""wow, my vagina just shot up. Damn."" Most recently someone from work decided to try and play a prank on me(might have been her) by creating a Facebook account pretending to be an attractive woman with giant boobs. Obviously, I saw through this and just wanted to play around with the person so I started messaging them all sorts of sexually perverted stuff for fun. I sent the conversation to my friend because I thought it was funny and she responded, ""I'm going to have to wash my hands now;). If you need any help sexting let me know."" 

When she made the last comment I didn't respond because I was so grossed out. She messaged me a couple of times after that (4 I think) but deleted the messages before I could read them. When I saw her at work today I avoided her and was visibly pissed. She asked me if we were good and I just said yeah. 

After work I messaged her on Facebook asking her to please stop making sexual comments towards me as they were making me uncomfortable. She responded something like ""understood. won't happen again. ever."" and blocked me. I'm fucking pissed because I had to deal with this fucking crap from a woman that should fucking know better and now I'm worried about the repercussions at work. 

I did NOTHING to indicate that I was attracted to this woman at all. I said she was like my mom constantly and told her about girls I was interested in. When she started to make me uncomfrtable I stopped hanging out with her one-on-one. I'm just fucking annoyed. ",1,1736390798.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Firstly, this is my first reddit post but I prefer crowd sourcing information. Therefore I am very cautious and am heavily censoring everything to put my mind at ease. I am from the United States in a Suburban/Rural area. I am unsure the best course of action to take from the point I'm at... essentially:

* Unweighted GPA of 3.54902
* SAT 1260
* Grade Twelve
*  AP Classes
   * AP English Language and Composition
      * 4
   * AP US History
      * 4
   * AP Chemistry
      * Currently Enrolled
   * AP English Literature and Composition
      * Currently Enrolled
   * AP Statistics
      * Currently Enrolled
   * My school is small/medium so they do not offer many AP courses however I am trying to get the AP International Degree
      * I am trying to see if I am able to test out of the one class I am missing for it. Every other requirement I meet as long as I pass my tests this year. (I am aware this would not come in until much later though)
* A middle range amount of volunteer hours (I do not see it necessary to list them all here)
   * One was with a Youth Council, however, that is relatively notable
* Captain of the Robotics Team
   * For One Year
   * The program was dead two years ago (two members including me and no money)
      * I have revived it for the most part
* (There is a name for it which is unnecessary for this post) Special Needs Helper
   * I work a coffee shop that is ran by the Special Needs Students every week which also counts as service hours
   * I meet once a week to have lunch with/give them all someone to talk to who is not in their class
* Recommendations
   * I am confident I can get a recommendation letter from the majority of my teachers. Multiple are AP teachers and a few have high seated positions in the School System. 
   * I have been at my job for two years and am in a very high standing view of the owners and manager.
* External Things
   * I have been in person to Imperial College
      * I accompanied my dad on a business trip and sat in on his meeting. I met a professor and had a tour of the Hydrodynamics laboratory
   * I received an email from the Professor who is the head of the discipline I am aiming for
      * I have replied and am trying to begin a conversation.
* Anything else that puts me in a marketable position
   * I am trans mtf
      * I am lesbian
   * I have divorced parents (I think this one just helps monetarily)

  
I need suggestion on anything really, however, the most important things are:

* What routes did (whoever responds) take to get from the United States into Imperial
* How do my credits, scores, tests, &c. transfer over
* Are there things I can do to make myself more marketable e.g. Volunteer Work, Interviews with recruiters, &c.
* What sort of monthly budget am I looking at if I do get in.
* Should I start reaching out for the recommendations and collect all of them, or only ones from the most decorated individuals?
* Should I make a Portfolio or Resume similar to this post?
* Are there any things I can do to help with the cost?
   * My grandmother is British and I am getting dual citizenship through her to lower the cost.
* Are there any ""backways"" in. What I mean is:
   * My school counselor is from Ukraine. She attended a University here that she did not meet the requirements for. She, instead, opted for a different major that she was able to get into and then transferred once she met the requirements after some time.



Thank you to anyone that responds!

1hx2klm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hx2klm/aitah_for_getting_mad_at_my_husband_for_helping/,AITAH for getting mad at my husband for helping someone in need?,"
Hear me out. This is going to require some backstory as well sprinkled in. Maybe to the point of TMI... but I always have questions when reading these and trying to answer what I would ask as I go.

My husband (will call him Jack) ""lent"" money to a female ex coworker (will call her Susan). 

Everyone in this story are early 40s. We have been together 12yrs and have 2 kids together, I helped raise his 3, now, adult children (19-23yo) 2 of them still live with us. In a tragic house fire also lost my oldest son almost 7yrs ago when he was 8yo. In short we have been through a lot together.

My husband worked at this company for 13yrs and honestly was miserable (as were/are most of the employees). Susan started 2 or 3yrs ago and they would chat occasionally when he WFH she would send some üòò occasionally, which took note but didn't think too much of it. He started working in the office again and I knew they were work friends. Nothing really beyond that. Now one day Susan complained and asked for help to my husband of $100. He messaged me and asked me about it. I have helped others in the past & we have gotten help when in need (like when my son died). I said 'sure that hope for her to pay back half but the other half a gift and give her $200'. There was a whole sob story of he lazy husband, broken car, and kids etc. I thought little of it and I am at a point that make good money with my own business, and worked hard to get there. Double what he was making at this place. Well, eventually new managment and changes made this place of employment unbearable and would tell him to quit and just door dash to supplement, or at least look and apply elsewhere. After realizing how much I made this last year and my business has only been growing. He decided to to quit after 13yrs I told him  I support him and mental well-being worth more than that place/paycheck. In his finial weeks he found out that Susan and other newer employees were making more only solidifying his decision. He has been door dashing because he still wants to contribute to the household which I appreciate immensely. Jack has now been out of work for about a month. Applying and interviewing to different places, no luck yet. Susan reached out once to gossip about another employee leaving. Outside of that crickets from her. Today Susan reached out with a mini sob story and asked for $50. He told me when I got home from dropping off the kids at school and picked up coffees for us. He was heading out to do some door dashing (after taking 5-6days off due to snow). I scoffed, and he said I am going to 'no' and followed up with thoughts similar to mine - he not working right now. She also makes more than he did, and has not paid anything back from the last time... He then left to dash, and I went inside to work thinking nothing more of it. 

Side note - not that we need it back or even really expected it. I dont think anyone should expect it back when you loan money to people. To me paying back is sign of character.  

Later this afternoon as I was getting off a call with a client when I got a notification from Life 360  ""Jack arrived at (insert terrible job's name)"" having older kids that don't drive we all have life 360 and alert on places that were common like home and places of employment. I messaged him 'why are you at ""terrible job""?' he said he changed his mind and was trying to do the ""Christian thing"" and help someone in need. I saw red. Yes we are Christian and I like to help those in need, but we already agreed no. I feel betrayed. 

He then started gaslighting me. All within 5-10mins he said things along the lines of - ""I'm gonna get shit for this cause I wanted to be a good person"" ""We've gotten help in the past"" ""I am not betraying you, we have $X amount in the bank"" ""If I can't spend $50, you need to get an ""ok"" with me to spend anything"" Now he is a narcissist, not trying to be accusational, 2 thearpist agreed on that diagnosis, and we almost broke up all together a few years ago because of it. He knows he is a narcissist. He has worked on it. I worked on not being a door mat. I let him know I will not be taking his gaslighting bullshit but because I stress and basically overthink everything. We are not hurting for money, it wasn't the fact of how much, but who was asking tbh. AITAH?

Also, according to all I know they are not friends. Just ex coworkers at this point. Idk why was she comfortable enough to ask to begin with... that alone annoys me.",1,1736390500.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False
1hx2k8f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hx2k8f,"Thursday, January 09, 2025 | Word of The Day ""Beyond Words"" - When Actions Speak Louder: The Unspoken Power of What We Do ‚Ä¢ [Click to Expand] ","## Beyond Words: How Our Actions Define Who We Are


Have you ever had someone promise to help you out but then not follow through? Or maybe you‚Äôve experienced the opposite‚Äîsomeone who didn‚Äôt say much but showed up for you when you needed it most. These moments stick with us because they tap into something fundamental about human behavior: actions speak louder than words. 

It‚Äôs a phrase we hear often, but what does it really mean? And why is it so universally true? Let‚Äôs dive into the idea, unpacking its meaning, exploring its implications, and seeing how it plays out in our lives.

### The Disconnect Between Words and Actions  
We live in a world filled with words. Social media posts, promises, speeches, and casual conversations are part of our daily lives. Words are powerful‚Äîthey can inspire revolutions, convey love, or spark understanding. But they‚Äôre also easy to manipulate. You can say anything, after all. Saying, ‚ÄúI care about the environment,‚Äù is far easier than consistently recycling, reducing waste, or taking public transportation. 

This is where actions come into play. Unlike words, actions are tangible. They‚Äôre visible proof of our intentions and values. When there‚Äôs a disconnect between what someone says and what they do, it‚Äôs the actions we tend to believe. Think of a politician who preaches equality but supports policies that widen the gap between rich and poor. Their actions expose their true priorities, undermining their words entirely.

### Why Actions Resonate More Deeply  
Actions have a unique way of cutting through noise. They tap into our primal instincts, showing rather than telling us what‚Äôs real. For example, imagine two friends: one constantly assures you they‚Äôll be there for you but never follows through, while the other quietly shows up when you‚Äôre in need. Who would you trust more?  

This is because actions create trust‚Äîor break it. They build relationships and reputations. A kind gesture, like helping a stranger carry heavy bags, speaks volumes about your character. It‚Äôs not what you say about yourself but what you do that shapes how others see you. 

On a deeper level, actions resonate because they involve effort. Words require little energy‚Äîactions demand commitment. They reflect priorities. Choosing to spend your time volunteering at a shelter rather than binge-watching your favorite show reveals what truly matters to you. 

### Personal Anecdotes: Lessons From Real Life  
Let me share a story. A few years ago, I worked with someone who always talked about being a team player. He had the jargon down: collaboration, synergy, mutual support‚Äîyou name it. But when deadlines approached, he was nowhere to be found. Another colleague, though, rarely spoke about teamwork but consistently stayed late to help finish projects. Guess who everyone respected more?  

This experience taught me that people might forget your words, but they‚Äôll remember how you made them feel. That colleague who quietly helped out earned the team‚Äôs trust‚Äînot because of what he said, but because of what he did.

Another example comes from my own family. Growing up, my parents emphasized the importance of kindness. They didn‚Äôt just say, ‚ÄúBe kind.‚Äù They showed it. I remember my dad mowing an elderly neighbor‚Äôs lawn every summer without expecting anything in return. That quiet act of kindness left a lasting impression on me, far more than any lecture ever could.

### Actions as a Measure of Integrity  
Integrity is a word we often associate with honesty and moral uprightness. But at its core, integrity is about consistency‚Äîaligning your actions with your words. When there‚Äôs a gap between the two, trust erodes. 

Take relationships as an example. If your partner says they love you but doesn‚Äôt prioritize spending time with you or supporting you, those words start to feel empty. Love isn‚Äôt just expressed in declarations‚Äîit‚Äôs demonstrated through care, patience, and effort.  

Similarly, in leadership, integrity is everything. Great leaders don‚Äôt just talk about their vision‚Äîthey embody it. Think of someone like Mahatma Gandhi. He didn‚Äôt just preach nonviolence; he lived it, even in the face of immense personal suffering. His actions gave his words power and credibility, making him a global symbol of peace.

### The Ripple Effect of Actions  
What‚Äôs fascinating about actions is their ripple effect. One small deed can inspire others, creating a chain reaction of positive behavior. Consider the concept of ‚Äúpaying it forward.‚Äù If someone shows you unexpected kindness‚Äîlike paying for your coffee‚Äîyou‚Äôre more likely to pass that kindness on to someone else.  

I experienced this once during a particularly tough week. A stranger let me cut in line at the grocery store because I was in a rush. It was such a small act, but it shifted my mood entirely. That day, I found myself being extra patient and kind to everyone I encountered. Actions, no matter how small, have the power to multiply.

### When Words Do Matter  
This isn‚Äôt to say that words are meaningless. Words can clarify, inspire, and connect. A heartfelt apology can mend a broken relationship, and a genuine ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of you‚Äù can lift someone‚Äôs spirits. But even here, actions matter. Words are most powerful when backed by consistent behavior.  

For example, if a parent praises their child‚Äôs talents but never shows up for their games or recitals, those words lose weight. However, combine encouragement with presence, and the impact is profound. It‚Äôs the combination of words and actions that creates a meaningful connection.

### How to Align Words and Actions  
So, how do we ensure our actions speak louder than our words? It starts with self-awareness. Ask yourself: Do my actions reflect my values? Am I following through on my commitments?  

Here‚Äôs a simple practice: whenever you make a promise, write it down. Treat it as a contract with yourself. Whether it‚Äôs calling a friend, sticking to a fitness goal, or volunteering your time, seeing it in writing helps hold you accountable.  

Another tip is to start small. Grand gestures are great, but consistent small actions often have a bigger impact. Smiling at a stranger, holding the door open, or sending a ‚Äúthinking of you‚Äù text are all ways to show kindness without overextending yourself.

### Closing Thoughts  
At the end of the day, actions are the truest expression of who we are. They reveal our priorities, shape our relationships, and leave a legacy. Words might echo for a moment, but actions create lasting change.  

So next time you find yourself making a promise or expressing a belief, pause. Ask yourself: what can I *do* to back this up? Because while words can build bridges, it‚Äôs our actions that carry us across them.

I (22F) started working at this office almost two years ago. On my second day I met one of my coworkers (27M) ""Gave"", and we really didn't get along as well. We don't have the same ideological opinions, and could crash about that.

Months after working there, we started to understand each other, even if we don't agree we learned to meet eye to eye and even started having fun while bickering, and it sort of became a highlight to my weeks. I honestly learned a lot from him, having such different views, and I think so did him: we learned to found middle ground and became actual friends, who did have a lot of other interests in common. I never liked him romantically, and honestly not that much physically, but he was hilarious and we did have chemistry.

I'll be 100% honest and upfront: I develop weird relationships with my coworkers. Any job I have becomes my life, I started working very young and always strived to be taken seriously, so I used to always do more and care too much. This is NOT a good thing, because most times it lead to me overworking myself and making mistakes. Hand to hand with this, because I put so much time in the job, it becomes my life emotionally as well, and it lead me to form VERY strong relationships VERY fast. Now: this isn't always bad. To this day, I have friends very dear to me who I met working and it's absolutely fine, but when this was happening, after I had just started working at this place (I was 20 years old) I went all in. I made a very strong friendship with two colleagues that then came crushing down (they got mad at each other because of unrelated issue, and I ended up being left behind) and I slept with another coworker who was in a relationship at the time (completely my bad, inexcusable). These two things, EVERYBODY found out, and the second one mostly it was embarrasing.

So, 6 months after I started working there, all of this had happened and I wanted to turn on a new leaf. This new girl starts working (25F) ""Kiara"" and we get along fine. Honestly, I hadn't learnt my goddamn lesson yet, because we speedran a friendship. Less than a month of knowing each other, we got along like a house on fire. And not only in our job, but we went out together, had dinners, made plans. I went with her to apartment's showings (even lend her money to move to her new place), I rambled to her for hours about my family problems, she did too about hers. We have a deep, strong friendship outside and in spite of our job. For the months we were friends, she truly became my person.

But, about a month after she started working, Kiara broke up with her boyfriend and immediately started a sexual relationship with Gave. This was unexpected, as she had never mentioned being interested in the guy, but I was glad she was taking her mind off the hard break up. The things with Kiara, she keeps things very close to her chest. She rather lie, both to other and to herself, before daring to lose something. So when I asked her if she liked Gave as something more, and she laughed and said no, I believed it.

Now it seems obvious that there was something there, but the two of us had know each other for such little time. And the time I felt I understood her completely, but I clearly did not.

At this point, I've been working here for about an year, so I've known Gave for a year, and Kiara for five months, roughly. And I knew I was attracted to both of them. Now, since they had been sort of friends with benefits since they had met, I had very much decided to NEVER act on any wish, because it would have been crossing a line. Even if Kiara and gave weren't together, I wouldn't get involve with him to respect her, and I loved her as a friend too much to risk it for a horny moment.

That's until, for some reason, they both thought it would be a good idea to invite me for a threesome. This is something that they talked about together, just the two of them, for a while before deciding ""yeah, let's bring this up to her"" as a collectively agreed upon idea.

Kiara first mentioned it to me as a passing comment during a call we where having. She said ""ooh and the other day Gave said it would be hot if the three of us had a threesome hahah!"" and I just hahaed back and pretended I hadn't heard it.

Then a second time, about a week after, she told me ""oh and I never told you about that conversation with Gave about the threesome hahah!"" and again I played fool.

Because the truth is, I had thought about it. Me and Gave, again, we had chemisty. And I had always find Kiara stunning, but I valued the friendships I had with them a lot, and because they were already friends with benefits, I just thought: this will never happen.

But then, Kiara mentined it a third time. She told me, first laughing, how her and Gave had been talking about how fun a threesome could be, and when thinking with who, they thought me. She was half joking, half serious, and I could have answered leaning on the joking part, but I said ""don't offer me a fun time!"".

This leads to a serious to god plan. Kiara mediated the whole thing, and she even admitted being the one making the plans turned her on. Me and Gave were pretending nothing was happening and wouldn't even talk about it together, but we talked about it with her and she told us what the other was saying.

Kiara and I even ""tested out"" our chemisty by making out one day, and then after a week, finally me and Gave talked about it and made out too. First red flag here.

You gotta understand, most of these things happened while, during and/or at our job. We have the freedom of taking some free time and walking around the neighborhood, so we have moments where we could go off, and this is when me and Gave kissed. But when he invited me to walkd around the block (I truly didn't know it would end up with us kissing) I didn't tell Kiara beforehand. I told her after it happened, and she got COMPLETELY insecure and mad/sad because she didn't like not knowning.

Now, in hindsight, this is when I say ""oh, there's something more complex here and maybe a threesome is not a great idea"". But I asked her if she was sure everything was okay, and when she said yes I chose to believe her easily. She said that she wasn't sure how she would feel about the threesome during it, even if she wanted it, and was scare to disappoint us, but I said she could always put a stop to it.

So, we pick a date. The day comes, I go to Kiara's house, then we both head to Gave's. We start off talking, drinking some wine, then things happen. It's great, really, the three of us just fell completely into it, had an amazing time, chemistry off the charts.

It was so, so good in fact, that both Gave and me thought ""this is a things now"". Kiara had seem to have an amazing time as well, even said so, and the whole things was hilarious, fun and hot.

Then next morning, we all went together to work (yes, we don't share weekends) and it all fell apart. Immediately Kiara got weird, she made an excuse to avoid us for a couple of hours, and druing the afternoon she took me and Gave to a part of the office where no one could hear us, and told us that the threesome was nice, but that it ""woke in her unrelated feelings that tinted her experience"", like her grandpa dying. Now, it's true that her grandfather had died a couple of months back, and a couple of weeks after this was happening she was traveling to see her family for the first time after this, so OF COURSE it was bringing a bunch of hard and painful feelings.

But it felt weird that it was coming to her during a threesome. Gave was completely in shocked, and almost pissed off because he had also felt the whole things was great, and then suddenly it wasn't, and he just knew there was something she wasn't telling us.

After work, me and Kiara talked, and she told me she had feelings for Gave, and that she couldn't share him, even when she wasn't willing to admit her feeling for him. Thing us: Gave is not a bad guy, but he chooses not to see, and thinks his limits are an excuse for being a bitch, sometimes. He only slept with Kiara when he wanted to, and would give her the cold shoulder at the office so no one would suspect. He is a very private person, and from moment one he had told her he wanted nothing serious, and always described their relationship to her as ""friends who sometimes fuck"". She's not the type to have that sort of relationship, but she stayed because it was better than not having him (her words).

So she tells me ""I know he's not mine, and I told him it was completely okay if he wanted to keep sleeping with you, but you have to know it would hurt me a lot if you did, and because it's not fair to ask you two to never have sex again, then I can't be with you either"".

Which was fine by me. I was shocked, yes, and sad because I did want to be with them again, but she was my best friend. I could put it all behind.

What happened, is that she wasn't doing okay. And she wouldn't talk about it with me, of course, because I was a part of this experience, but she talked about it with another coworker of us (29F) Lisa. I couldn't hear them, but I saw them. Our 9 hour shift, I saw them talking about this very personal experience of mine, and of course I don't blame Kiara for needing to talking about it (even though the three of us had decided to keep it secret, specially from the office). And we are there for so many hours, where else will she talked about it? But honestly is was maddening.

I felt trapped. Like I couldn't walk away, I had to stay at my desk and do my job while seeing just a couple of feet away from me my best friend (who was barely talking to me and pretending nothing had happened, while also looking depressed) and Lisa talking about a sexual experience I had been a part of for HOURS. I'm embarrassed to say how much this affected me.

There where other things going on in my life at this point, and this just took me over the edge. I looked distraught, really, it was clear that I was going through something, and that Kiara was going through something. Put two and two together and all our coworkers just knew something had happened between the two of us, and it all led to both of us saying hurtful things.

I said one horrible thing. Now, me and Kiara again where best friends before this, we knew a lot of personal things about each other and would often make jokes about it. She would joke about the issues I had with my parents, I joked about her ex. But of course, at that point things weren't great between us, it wasn't a moment to be joking about anything. But one afternoon we were all playing a Mortal Combat together at our office (it was a very slow day), and to fire her her up to beat her opponent in the game, I said ""Imagine the other fighter is your ex, who walked past you!""

That was a bitch comment. I was wrong to say that, and the worst part is, I didn't even notice. I was trying to make everything good between us, to go back to how we were, but that comment made her very, very mad. To the point she left home early, and the next day she invited me to have coffee.

This is when she said she had wanted to knock me down after I had said that, literally, because of how mad it made her. I apologized profusely, and said the truth, that I hand't even realized what I was saying and that I would never want to hurt her. I also said that her and Lisa talking about the threesome right in front of me had me going mad as well, that I feel trapped at our job, and she said textually ""I did notice it hurt you, but I really needed to talk about it, so I couldn't care about it, I'm sorry"".

It was a nice conversation, we both cried and said how much we valued our friendship. We really just came clean about everything and both said we wanted to work through everything.

So it was a shock when the next day, she starting being cold. She would be super nice one second, and then ignore me the next. She got all tense when me and Gave barely even talked, and again we all work together, and me and Gave had gotten along great before all this.

Actually, Gave had invited me to his home twice after the threesome, but I'd say no, because Kiara had told me she didn't want it, while she had told him that it was alright.

After some weeks of this, Lisa came to me. The two of us always got along very well, but I hadn't want to talk to her about this whole things because she had become Kiara's safe space. But Lisa came and quite literally told me: ""Kiara doesn't trust you, she's even asking me to pay attention to you and Gave to see if you are closer, she is desperate to know you two aren't sleeping together anymore, and ther's nothing you can do for her to trust you. You need to wait until she cools off.""

And this was my turning point. I cannot explain how much I adored Kiara. She was my person, my closest friend. But I clearly wasn't to her. I felt that she had sort of used me, not voluntarily, but she was afraid Gave was bored of her, and accept and insisted on the threesome so she could keep him. I felt like just means to an end. It's fine, it's her choice to pick him over our friendship, and I can respect it even if it hurts. But then, I wasn't going to keep choosing her either.

So me and Gave started sleeping together. Bad, bad decision. It went on for a couple of months. He said he wanted to talk to Kiara to say he didn't want the two of them sleeping together anymore because everything had become too complicated.

But then he started treating me as he had treated her, which is to say not at all like a gentleman. Now, because I didn't like him romantically, it was different for me. I knew that he could call me 11PM to go to his house, make some fuss for a while, and then had to go back to my home even if it was 2AM. I understood that's how it went, and for a while I was okay with it.

During those months, I didn't know much about Kiara. I know she started seeing someone else, then broke it off, she had some issues at her apartment, started therapy, barely that. My and Gave also didn't talk about her, and barely about anything at all.

The whole thing with him was steamy messages, then quick fucking, then me back to my house past midnight. We had some awkward moments, and without discussing it, we just stopped sleeping together. Honestly, it stopped being worth the while for me.

Which brings us to the present. I've tried to be the adult. Truth is, being near Kiara still breaks my heart. I miss her, I resent her for not choosing our friendship, I'm embarres for having done something she said she didn't want me to do, also pissed off at myself for still caring so much about her wellbeing when she didn't care about mine. But we work together, so I push it all to the back.

I am a good colleague. I'm a good coworker to both her and Gave (who basically ignores me every shift, and I ignore him back now). The thing that broke my heart the longest, was having lost the friendship I had with both, especially Kiara. But I remain civil.

Until now. I'm pretty sure they are back to sleeping together, maybe even in an actual relationship, and I'm pissed off. Jealous, even. I mean, I lost everything: my best friend, my good, the place I felt comfortable. I am never at ease when Kiara is around me. I'm so hurt by everything I've been looking for a new job, but nothing pays well and I can't just quit. I still feel so trapped, so alone, and now it seems like the two of them are back as if nothing had ever happened, maybe even better than ever!

I had made peace with everything falling apart between the three of us, but them two being alright? It super toxic of me, I know. And I feel like I'm going backwards with all the growth and the mature way I tried going about things.

Is it immature to want them to be unhappy as well? How much do I suck? I made many mistakes during this whole thing, but I wasn't the only one, right?",0,1736390377.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

As more of us adopt an active, on-the-go lifestyle, it‚Äôs essential to make choices that are both convenient and in harmony with the environment. At Allwear, we believe in creating fashion that‚Äôs versatile, durable, and sustainably crafted to meet the demands of busy lives while caring for the planet.¬†

Whether you‚Äôre commuting, exercising, or simply enjoying life on the move, here‚Äôs how you can stay eco-friendly without sacrificing comfort or style.

# Why Choose Organic and Natural?

When it comes to sustainable living, the materials we wear matter. Conventional fabrics are often made from synthetic fibers that not only take centuries to degrade but also involve chemical processes harmful to both our health and the environment. Organic and natural fabrics, on the other hand, are crafted from materials that are biodegradable and free from toxic pesticides or dyes.

Here at Allwear, we design our clothing using organic and natural fibers that are not only good for the planet but are also lightweight, breathable, and perfect for your on-the-go needs.

# Essential Organic Clothing for Life on the Move

Living sustainably doesn‚Äôt mean sacrificing function or style, and our core products reflect this balance perfectly:

**Allwear Organic 5"" Sweat Shorts:** Made from organic cotton, these shorts are the ideal choice for an active lifestyle. Their breathable, soft fabric keeps you comfortable whether you‚Äôre running errands, hitting the gym, or lounging at home. Plus, organic cotton is cultivated without synthetic fertilizers or harmful pesticides, ensuring that your skin is free from irritation and that your choices are kind to the environment.

**Allwear Organic Half-Zip Hoodie:** A perfect companion for those brisk morning runs or casual meetups, this hoodie is crafted from organic cotton, blending style and sustainability seamlessly. Its versatility makes it an easy pick for any occasion, and its organic composition means you can stay warm and cozy without exposing your body to harmful chemicals commonly found in synthetic fabrics.

**Allwear Bamboo Bra Top 2.0:** Designed for comfort and mobility, this bra top uses bamboo fibers‚Äîa natural and highly renewable resource. Bamboo fabric is soft, moisture-wicking, and anti-bacterial, making it an ideal material for activewear. Whether you‚Äôre headed to a yoga class or just running around town, this top is as supportive as it is eco-friendly.

# Sustainable Fashion for the Modern Nomad

An on-the-go lifestyle calls for clothing that‚Äôs as adaptable as you are. At Allwear, we believe that less is more, which is why our garments are designed to be multifunctional, offering the versatility you need to move through life with ease.¬†

Our collection of organic essentials can easily transition from workout gear to everyday fashion, ensuring you have fewer pieces with more use. This not only simplifies your wardrobe but also helps reduce consumption, one of the key pillars of sustainable living.

# Packing Light, Living Green

Sustainable living isn‚Äôt just about what you wear‚Äîit‚Äôs also about how you live. When you‚Äôre constantly on the move, adopting sustainable habits like packing light and choosing multi-functional products can significantly reduce your environmental footprint.

Here are a few tips to incorporate into your on-the-go routine:

**Opt for Reusables:** Whether it‚Äôs a water bottle, shopping bag, or coffee cup, bringing reusable items with you on your travels is an easy way to cut down on single-use plastics.

**Mindful Packing:** Streamline your packing by investing in versatile clothing like the Allwear Organic Half-Zip Hoodie and Bamboo Bra Top 2.0, which can serve multiple purposes‚Äîsaving you space while keeping your wardrobe sustainable.

**Natural Fabrics for Active Days:** Organic cotton and bamboo are excellent choices for active days, as they are naturally breathable and moisture-wicking, keeping you cool and dry no matter what your schedule demands.

# The Future of Sustainable, On-the-Go Living

At Allwear, our mission is to make sustainability a part of everyday life, even for those constantly on the move. We believe that every small choice, from the clothes you wear to the items you pack, contributes to a larger impact. With thoughtfully crafted pieces like the Allwear Organic 5"" Sweat Shorts, Organic Half-Zip Hoodies, and \*\*Bamboo Bra Top 2.0 , we‚Äôre committed to helping you live a life that‚Äôs both sustainable and stylish.

By embracing organic, natural materials and making mindful choices, you can stay connected to the earth‚Äîeven when your life is fast-paced. The beauty of sustainable living is that it doesn‚Äôt have to slow you down. In fact, it makes your life lighter, simpler, and more in tune with the planet.",1,1736390301.0,allwearcom,0,1.0,False

I did my first injection last evening around 945 pm and went to bed about 45 minutes later.  I didn‚Äôt notice anything different right after the injection. I woke up at 5 and felt a little off, but not bad. Sluggish is probably the best way to describe it.  I usually get up at 5 to workout. This time, I could only muster up the energy to walk a mile and a half. What‚Äôs wild, though, is I had no desire for my morning coffee.  My morning coffee has been a diehard ritual for at least 8 years and it is one I look forward to very much. There have been long stretches of my life where having that cup of coffee alone in the morning was the only thing I looked forward to, so it‚Äôs a strong habit with deep roots in the dopamine forest. I didn‚Äôt drink my morning cup, nor did I have my typical second cup when I got to the office. Crazy.

I was so tired, though, that I actually sprawled out in the floor with the cats in front of the fireplace and took a 20 minute nap before I left for work. I had half of an Oikos Pro yogurt cup around 830. The exhaustion persisted throughout the morning and then the nausea hit.  It. Was. ROUGH. I ended up leaving work for a nap in my car for an hour around 12:15. I was finally able to entertain the idea of food again around 230, when I had a cup of strawberries, some mini carrots, and grilled chicken and mixed greens in a Mission Carb Balance tortilla. I was completely full and the nausea went away.  I had no cravings for my little mini chocolate afterward. 

I usually work out after work (yes, I workout twice a day), but I wasn‚Äôt sure if I had the energy to pull it off. I went anyway and settled for a medium paced one mile walk and ten minutes of yoga instead of strength training. There was just no gas in the tank. 

Dinner was homemade chicken pot pie, of which I had a modest serving. I was definitely in control of my portions and my appetite, with no post-dinner sweet cravings to contend with. 

So now it‚Äôs 9pm and I am very, very tired and can‚Äôt wait to go to sleep! I haven‚Äôt eaten enough calories today but I am hopeful that I can do better tomorrow. There‚Äôs no way I could choke down a protein shake right now, though I really want to for the extra hit of protein.

I just wanted to share this for anyone who is looking for information about that first day, as I was very curious before I began. I started with the lowest dose from Hallendale via LSH and I injected in the stomach this first time.  FWIW, I totally bent the needle on my first poke but in the end, I barely felt a thing. 

As of last evening, I was 162.2 and my goal weight is 140. I am perimenopausal and have had problems with weight settling in my midsection lately, though initially HRT did help me get some weight off. I am a very active person and love lifting weights, but I just couldn‚Äôt get any movement on this new excess fat and my cholesterol was getting high so I decided to just go for it.  Insurance doesn‚Äôt cover it, so I‚Äôm hoping that it will remain available to me via LSH for so long as I might need it.",2,1736390006.0,SemaglutideCompound,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been living in Korea for around 4 years and I noticed that I‚Äôm getting lonelier as the years go by. Most of the friends that I‚Äôve made, Korean and foreigners left. And I really mean most of them. I only have a handful who live between here and their home countries so it‚Äôs hard to reach them. I often contact my friends but I‚Äôd rather see them. 

Up until two years ago, I was very social. I barely stayed at home. Even when I was dating my husband, I was always out doing something somewhere. I was in a lot of group chats and always had someone to talk to and hang out with. Eventually everything stopped.

I just want to find friends. Preferably other women around my age. Single or in relationships I don‚Äôt really care. I love my husband a lot but I feel like my brain is rotting by only being around men all the time. I want to go out for brunch, coffee, drinks and shopping. I want to find people who I can talk to about anything. I feel like I lost myself a little and even my in laws have noticed it. It feels weird being felt sorry for not having any friends. 

I yearn for a sense of community. I tried looking around last year by asking several group chats that I was in. I asked to join in any events or parties they were advertising. The problem was, my profile picture on KakaoTalk at the time was a picture of my husband. A lot of the women in the group chat thought I was some random dude trying to infiltrate. I tried to explain and had people who knew me in person back me up but I had to leave. Since then I‚Äôve been avoiding people. That quick judgement scared me off.

You had shops specializing in imported goods like Kaldi opening everywhere and a greater variety of goods on regular store shelves, and the advent of online shopping introduced even more.

I'm wondering if this trend is starting to reverse itself, partly thanks to lingering effects of Covid era supply chain disruptions, partly the result of the weakened Yen making imports more costly, partly some other factors.  I've noticed over the past year or so that some types of products that I had come to take for granted as being easy to obtain are no longer available in stores.

Per vet recommendation they needed to lose weight for long term health and to prevent joint issues. We didn‚Äôt really measure their food before but it is definitely less than half of what they were getting. 

It‚Äôs been about a week now and our dogs are constantly circling the food bowl, begging for our food, and whining. They are very clearly hungry after their vet recommended portions. My lab mix girl has always been slightly food aggressive but she has been out of control lately.

Hear me out. This is going to require some backstory as well sprinkled in. 

My husband (will call him Jack) ""lent"" money to a female ex coworker (will call her Susan). 

Everyone in this story are early 40s. We have been together 12yrs and have 2 kids together, I helped raise his 3, now, adult children (19-23yo) 2 of them still live with us. In a tragic house fire also lost my oldest son almost 7yrs ago when he was 8yo. In short we have been through a lot together.

My husband worked at this company for 13yrs and honestly was miserable (as were/are most of the employees). Susan started 2 or 3yrs ago and they would chat occasionally when he WFH she would send some üòò occasionally, which took note but didn't think too much of it. He started working in the office again and I knew they were work friends. Nothing really beyond that. Now one day Susan complained and asked for help from my husband of $100. He messaged me and asked me about it. I have helped others in the past & we have gotten help when in need (like when my son died). I said 'sure and HOPE for her to pay back half but the other half a gift and give her $200'. Susan had a whole sob story of her lazy husband, broken car, and kids etc. Not to belittle her issues, it just didn't matter to me, I dont know her. I thought little of it and I am at a point that make good money with my own business and worked hard to get where I am. Double what he was making at this place. Well eventually new managment and changes made this place of employment unbearable and would tell him to quit and just door dash to supplement, or at least look and apply elsewhere. After realizing how much I made this last year and my business has only been growing. He decided to to quit after 13yrs I told him  I support him and mental well-being worth more than that place/paycheck. In his finial weeks he found out that Susan and other newer employees were making more only solidifying his decision. He has been door dashing because he still wants to contribute to the household which I appreciate immensely. 

Jack has now been out of work for about a month. Applying and interviewing to different places, no luck yet. Susan reached out once to gossip about another employee leaving. Outside of that crickets from her. Today Susan reached out with a mini sob story and asked for $50. He told me when I got home from dropping off the kids at school and picked up coffees for us. He was about to head out to do some door dashing (after taking 5-6days off due to snow). I scoffed, and he said I am going to say 'no' and followed up with thoughts similar to mine - he not working right now. She also makes more than he did, and has not paid anything back from the last time... (the audacity... I hear Charlotte in my head saying ""How are you not embarrassed!"")
He then left to dash, and I went inside to work thinking nothing more of it. 

Side note - We do not that we need it back, or even really expected it. I dont think anyone should expect it back when you loan money to people. To me paying back is sign of character.  

Later this afternoon as I was getting off a call with a client when I got a notification from Life 360  ""Jack arrived at (insert terrible job's name)"" having older kids that don't drive we all have life 360 and alert on places that were common like home and places of employment. I messaged him 'why are you at ""terrible job""?' he said he changed his mind and was trying to do the ""Christian thing"" and help someone in need. I saw red. Yes we are Christian and I like to help those in need, but we already agreed no. I feel betrayed. 

He then started gaslighting me. All within 5-10mins he said things along the lines of - ""I'm gonna get shit for this cause I wanted to be a good person"" ""We've gotten help in the past"" ""I am not betraying you, we have $X amount in the bank"" ""If I can't spend $50, you need to get an ""ok"" with me to spend anything"" Now he is a narcissist, not trying to be accusational, 2 thearpist agreed on that diagnosis, and we almost broke up all together a few years ago because of it. He knows he is a narcissist. He has worked on it. I worked on not being a door mat. I let him know I will not be taking his gaslighting bullshit, but because I stress and basically overthink everything. We are not hurting for money, it wasn't the fact of how much, but who was asking. AITAH?

Also, according to all I know they are not friends. Just ex coworkers at this point. Idk why was she comfortable enough to ask to begin with... that alone annoys me.",6,1736388939.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,1.0,False

Of course they'd be mad about that, duh. 

I'm talking about the small, minute improvements that you make for the sake of simple bettering. I like to call them, 'just because improvements'. 

For instance, this holiday season he gifted me a really nice set of Kate Spade PJs. I was super excited about it as one of my silly resolutions from last year was to collect about 7-9 sets so that I could have a fresh pair to wear every night -- it's honestly such a luxury! Resolution achieved! 

These are super cute and have flying piggies on them and I'm totally obsessed. However, there's a small problem. Every single button hole was too big so if I buttoned them at night, by the morning my PJ top was completely open. It didn't matter what I did, that top was not staying buttoned. 

So I took some time to sew each hole smaller so that the buttons couldn't ever escape again. I'm fine with my top being permanetly closed because....well I wasn't wearing it any other way. This created a new problem: I was still being exposed because the 2.5 inch space between each button was now jutting open and refused to lay flat. Solution: Liquid Stitch. I applied a few dots in between the spaces and now I have my PJ top exactly how I want it to be. It stays 100% closed now. 

Like I said, I have multiple pairs of PJs ranging from Aldi to Target to Walmart and now Kate Spade. I have never had this problem with even my cheapest set; Kate Spade is a great brand but for some reason these PJs were just plain old, unpredicted bad quality. But it wasn't a big deal because I quickly found a solution that worked. 

So tell me why he is now upset that I fixed my top? I mean I know why but it's still so ??????? Like c'mon dude. He's not happy with this improvement because he spent a lot of money on them which I can kinda understand; all my other sets are $10-20 and they have quality zero issue. However, I'm not going to wear anything that doesnt work and isn't comfortable. Now my top stays shut and is incredibly comfortable. What's the issue? Apparently I'm too ""unreasonable"" and the things I do, ""makes no sense"". From my perspective, it's as if he's being inconvienced yet he has nothing to do with these little improvements. These are all my choices that I'm happy to change and make on my own. 

Other examples: 

- He get's huffy when I ask for cold foam on my iced coffee. Says that I'm being ""extra"" and that its ""unneeded"". It's not about need but rather want. I wanted my coffee to be tastier

- He has disdain for my kindle because I've decorated it with stickers and a pop socket. According to him, I've ""ruined the value"" of it. It's my kindle and I simply wanted it cuter. 

- I recently returned a skirt for the same one in a different color that looked better on me. He got frustrated because I should ""be an adult"" and know exactly which one I wanted when I originally bought it. I guess there's no such thing as a change of heart or something, I dunno.

1hx1jfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/niseko/comments/1hx1jfm/all_my_niseko_village_tips_hiltonritz/,All my Niseko Village tips (Hilton/Ritz),"Since I used this group to do a lot of my Niseko ski planning, I thought I would give back with an overview of my experience and debunk some of the myths I read.

¬†

Context: couple traveling to Niseko, 1 week, no kids. Pretty mid-range travelers.

¬†

* Lodging: The Ritz Higashiyama and Hilton are both ski-in/out but have a VERY different feel. We stayed at both. Overall, the ritz felt like a vacation spot and the hilton was chaotic and stressful.
   * Ritz- Overall, incredible experience. Do whatever you can to book this place on points because it's amazing. The ski rental and ski lockers in the basement of the hotel make for an incredibly convenient and comfortable ski-in/out experience. You can rent a private onsen for \~$30 USD/hour and it comes fully stocked with towels, water bottles, robes, slipper, toiletries, etc. Great option, super clean, and a bit more modest for shy folks like me out there!
   * Hilton- Overall, this place felt like a machine and we didn't like our stay. It's \*very\* crowded with lots of families which is fine, but it there are people lying all over the ground in the lobby and people connecting their phone to outlets and it felt like more like an airport. I think if my Chinese was better I would enjoy it (I'm out of practice after several years!) The hotel pretty explicitly caters to a Chinese audience in terms of food options and nightly entertainment and Chinese speaking staff. Now on to the rooms. The rooms have a weird smell and feel very outdated. Since they haven't been remodeled, you get weird design things like no mirror in front of sink in bathroom, a bunch of rusted metal and faucets, peeling countertops, stained carpets, and light switches that are not user friendly. Most rooms are twin bed rooms, so not great for a couple but could see how this would be good for families. Don't let the online photos of the rooms fool you, they are much, much worse! Pretty sure the views they show in the windows are photoshopped‚Ä¶ No ski lockers available, but there is an overrun ski rental place inside the hotel. The onsen is pretty crowded and no private onsen option. The breakfast buffet is raved about on these threads, but there's nuance. Yes it's huge, but all the food is low quality and not tasty. It reminded me of a Las Vegas breakfast buffet. My partner who is really not picky at all about food felt the same. Gym is really depressing as well. I think if I was traveling with kids, had points (we didn't and paid cash) so the rooms came out cheap, and my entire purpose of the trip was to focus on skiing (much cheaper to learn in Niseko versus states), then I would choose this place. To be clear, this hotel is not relaxing though, there are just so many people even after holidays!
* Food in Niseko: Despite other threads, there are plenty of food options in Niseko Village (both resorts connected to the village you can walk there). You don't need a car! Here's a rundown of some of the hotspots in the village-
   * Coffee- There's a great coffee shop ometesando coffee
   * Pizza- pated top in APAC it's called Baby Crosta, get the mortadella flavor trust me and the maitake also quite good
   * Pharmacy/convenience store- Yes, and way better than the Hirafu option which has no medicine
   * Hotpot- NO! Avoid the hotpot place Chuan at all costs, had a really strange experience there where they posted wrong photos of items on their menu, and then wouldn't give us the right item to match the photo or a refund. When we called out that the photos were wrong they went into their digital menu and replaced the photos 5 min later and were gaslighting us saying we actually had the wrong understanding. Luckily we had taken screenshots of our digital receipt to prove they swapped the photos after the fact. Just a super weird move overall. I used to live in China so I'm pretty familiar with hot pot and this was probably the least appetizing I had ever had and VERY expensive. Also children running around screaming in the restaurant, might have been an off night, but no staff so was intervening at all. The lying about the menu gave me the ick.
   * Japanese-The uni bowl at Yang Shu Ten is great value, and the staff is so kind there! Traditional Japanese restaurant. Stop by Milk Kobo (use the shuttle) for some Hokkaido dairy, ice cream is fantastic there.
* What is walkable? You can walk between Hilton, Ritz, and Niseko village (also called Niseko Yo and is where all the food is) easily.
* Food in Hirafu:
   * Barn- french restaurant and on the fancier side, loved it, book in advance via tableog. The wagyu and beef cheeks are wonderful. Really don't think the pre-fixe is necessary, we did a la carte and pricing is pretty similar, you just get more flexibility with a la carte. The white wine was really delightful, and I'm not even a big drinker. It was La Tour Saint-Martin (2022). Super light not too oaky, very mellow.
   * Kitchen- also great and fancier meal
   * Bar Gyu- might seem gimmicky because it's on TikTok but the drinks are actually quite good and the vibe is awesome (you're literally on a snowbank that's lit so it has cool views inside).¬† Get the 7 spice wine, it's how mulled wine \*should\* taste (yay! They don't use cheap red wine in it). They don't take groups larger than 8. You do have to wait in line because no reservations, we found line was shortest when we showed up at 6:30/6:45. We waited for about 30 min.
* Food(bonus- Hirafu Mountain)- If you ski at Hirafu, the curry place there on the mountain (it's a green chairlift so pretty much all levels can eat there) is phenomenal. It's cheap but cash only though and gets pretty crowded so go eat at 11 or later lunch. It's on the side of the mountain where Skye resort is (not the main part with gondala, it's across parking lot). Entrance to that side of mountain is between Skye and Muwa resorts, there's only one lift, and it's at the top of that lift. Sorry forgot the name of the place but these are pretty specific instructions on how to get there.
* Transportation- Almost every thread said you need a car. No you don't if you're staying in Niseko. You have lots of dining in the village or in the Hilton itself. If you want to go outside Niseko you have three options:
   * Shuttle bus- If you want to go to Hirafu the shuttle bus runs to and from until 11pm (not 8pm like some other threads said, and this schedule is the same until March)
   * Taxi/Uber- You can download GoTaxi (their version of Uber) and a taxi from Niseko-->Hirafu will be around $12-25 depending on time of day. The cars are those fancy Toyota Alphards that have nice leg lifts and reclines
   * Hotel arranged transport- Another perk of the Ritz is the concierge ROCKS. They can arrange taxis for you in case you have trouble with GoTaxi, a little more expensive than the app but not by much
   * Getting from New Chitose to hotel- take the NDS shuttle ([https://niseko-ds.com/](https://niseko-ds.com/)). It's about $40 USD per person and goes direct to Hilton and Ritz. A private taxi will run you about $350-450 each way depending on size and the shuttle is so easy. It's rarely full, it doesn't have bathrooms but they do make a stop at a rest area. Really seamless experience
* Ski rentals-  I used Niseko village which is in basement of the Ritz open 8-5pm and they give you your own ski locker (the provider in Hilton will hold your skis and boots for you, but you don't get your own locker, and you must take everything else to room). No fee to reserve: [https://www.nv-rental.com/](https://www.nv-rental.com/)
* Other tips
   * Luggage courier/deliver service-¬†If skiing is only one part of your Japan travels, pack a separate ski bag and use Yamato luggage delivery (usually at every airport or hotel) and ship off your luggage to your ski hotel. When we landed at Tokyo Haneda airport, we went straight to the Yamato counter after the baggage pick up, sent our luggage to the Ritz for about $20 and it arrived in two days. You can even do same day if you drop off before 11am or 12pm (forget the cutoff time). If you forget to do it at the airport, often hotels can arrange it for you. It was SO nice to travel between cities without lugging our huge ski bag because the train stations have so many steps in Japan and you just have to be pretty mobile. This system is widely used in the country, it's not like UPS or Fedex, it's way better, reliable, and cheap. Silly if you don't use it. Travel luggage-free, why not!

Hope this is helpful, feel free to ask any questions. I leaned on reddit heavily planning this trip and happy to pay it forward!

Man so uh. I started doing some major-ish edits to the first couple of chapters, and it kinda got out of hand to the point that it caused a big delay in the next chapter. No worries though, none of the plot is being changed in any significant way, I'm mostly just adding more details (mostly).

\~\~\~\~\~

‚ÄúA dunkle! An ancient fish from Earth! Very ancient! And very dead! All of them! Wait a minute why is it here then?‚Äù I circled around the now dead fish, violating every inch of it with my eyes. Get your minds out of the gutter, readers, for I was in *analysis mode.*

Sanon seemed confused, though not in the ‚ÄòI‚Äôve never heard of that‚Äô sense. More like the ‚Äòwhat is this guy even talking about‚Äô sense. ‚ÄúMax, that‚Äôs a *cho√ßplatszyb.‚Äù*

*record\_scratch.mp3*

‚ÄúA what?‚Äù

‚Äú...oh right,‚Äù Sanon put a hand to her face, chuckling to herself. ‚ÄúA jawblade fish.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat was the other name?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was just the Lontish name‚Ä¶‚Äù Sanon sighed. ‚ÄúI forgot the Common name.‚Äù

*Ohhhh‚Ä¶ cool! Anyway. Fish.*

‚ÄúI uh‚Ä¶ I see. So about the dunkle‚Ä¶ wanna eat it? I did say I caught us dinner.‚Äù

Sanon‚Äôs face lit up, though it was quickly tempered. ‚ÄúDo you even know how to cook one? I‚Äôve never prepared one of these before.‚Äù

Rather than use my words, I instead retrieved Stabby from the fish‚Äôs neck area place thing. I knelt down in front of the belly, and made an incision. The skin was actually pretty thick, but I made it through with enough effort.

*I should probably find a way to sharpen Stabby soon.*

I used a nearby branch to hold the cut I made open long enough to reach my hands in. ‚ÄúSanon, do you know how to set up a spit roast?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think we could use the head of the tree you knocked over to support the central shaft‚Ä¶‚Äù she mused. She then wordlessly picked up one end of the tree and dragged it away, before she began her business.

While Sanon carefully spelled off the top of the tree, I continued cleaning the dunkle. It was certainly an experience. Gutting it was easy enough, if tedious considering that I hadn‚Äôt cleaned a fish of it‚Äôs size before, but I made do.

The real trouble was the armor. While it didn‚Äôt extend any further back than what I remembered seeing in fossils back home, it was attached in such a way that I couldn‚Äôt just pry it off. Some of the plates near the back of the head had fused with the spine of the creature, making for quite the challenge.

Eventually I did manage to remove the armor, though only after deboning the rest of the fish. From what I could tell, the meat was still relatively soft. I didn‚Äôt know much about cooking‚Ä¶ but if I had to guess, then it might be a good idea to get it cooking ASAP. I didn‚Äôt want the meat to stiffen from rigor mortis.

I used Stabby to cut the meat into fillets, and used some of the smaller branches that Sanon had sheared off the makeshift boat to impale the meat. I stuck the fishy sticks into the ground so I could focus on other matters, namely the now mostly meatless carcass of a literal living fossil.

The jaws on it really were impressive, and I had my own thoughts about what I could do with them. They weren‚Äôt long enough to make into a new spearhead or anything, but they might make for a good knife. Some parts of the jaw blade were too small for even that, though. Perhaps arrowheads?

Either way, it wasn‚Äôt something I dwelled on for very long. Stabby‚Äôs head was good enough for me, and Sanon had a knife already. I wasn‚Äôt really certain of the value though, so I opted to just leave it be for now. I‚Äôd ask Sanon her thoughts later after we had eaten.

In the meantime, Sanon had finished constructing a spitroast, though a bit strange if you asked me. It was probably pretty heavy, but she at least had it oriented upright.

She approached me looking ever so slightly winded. ‚ÄúA knife wasn‚Äôt the best thing to make such a large cut with, and your spear‚Äôs spell would have taken too long. If we use any more verbal magic, you‚Äôre up this time.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah I guess that‚Äôs fair. Did it really take that much out of you?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not very good at using magic yet. If you remember, I mentioned that I destroyed the forge I had been an apprentice at.‚Äù

I nodded.

‚ÄúWell, part of my apprenticeship there involved learning to cast effectively and efficiently, but I was na√Øve and thought I could accelerate the process. I have a condition that makes it hard to control my manaflow, so the forgemaster was pretty quick to throw me out. And now I‚Äôm out here on a fool‚Äôs errand.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait wait wait. They can‚Äôt just basically *banish* you over something like that! I thought you were there to get better control?‚Äù I reasoned.

Sanon sighed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, that *was* a part of the apprenticeship, but most apprentices don‚Äôt destroy entire forges when they make stupid mistakes. They normally just burn themselves or have a small discharge. Nothing serious. I literally blew up the entire forge.‚Äù

She seemed pretty cross about the whole exchange, and to be honest, even at time of writing I‚Äôm still cross right there with her. I really should head down to those tribes and give ‚Äòem a piece of Maximillian Williardson.

\[I thought you hated that name?\]

It sends a message, okay?!

\~\~\~

After our small conversation on discrimination and its consequences, I picked Sanon‚Äôs brain on whether or not she knew of any edible plants that might go well with the unseasoned dunkle meat.

‚ÄúI never learned to cook, and I‚Äôm not from this region. What do you think?‚Äù was her answer.

And so that‚Äôs how Sanon and I ended up eating an extinct fish without any seasoning or really any real preparation at all!

‚ÄúWow this is terrible.‚Äù I said, stuffing my face with terrible meat.

‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt *that* bad.‚Äù said Sanon, also stuffing her face with meat that apparently wasn‚Äôt *that* bad.

For those of you readers on Earth, it tasted kinda like shark. Do with that what you will. The meat was pretty gamey, but in all honesty with a bit of seasoning it might have been pretty palatable.

Max Jr. had even joined us after disappearing into the marsh for an indeterminate amount of time. I have no clue what kind of adventure he had been on, but something in his eyes told me I didn‚Äôt want to know.

\~\~\~

After we finished eating our fill, the sky had begun to darken, the moons breaching the heavens. I hadn‚Äôt been paying as much attention to the sky the last few days, which was quite unfortunate. I seemed to have missed a pretty important arc in the story of these moons. The smaller of the two had managed to completely break apart, and was now doing considerable damage to the surface of the larger one. Surely this would have no consequences for Helsa at all.

Sanon, for some reason, seemed unbothered by it, instead choosing to sleep. In contrast, despite the tone I used to describe it, the actual event shook me to my very core, and a background of fear would tinge my dreams for the next few weeks. I never did ask Sanon why she didn‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm willing to believe that she simply didn‚Äôt notice, or so I tell myself. Maybe she knew something I didn‚Äôt.

Another thing to note was that my internal clock had begun to adapt to the 30-hour cycles of day and night. It felt really weird, and I‚Äôm not really sure if something like that is supposed to even happen. Like I‚Äôve said before, I‚Äôm no biologist, nor am I a doctor.

Sanon and I had once again chosen to sleep in a dried out chalice tree, though there was only one around this time. I could have dried one out with a fire spell, but I really didn‚Äôt want to exhaust myself even more. Instead, we simply chose to share the tree. And no, don‚Äôt start thinking anything weird. We were, and still are entirely platonic. Besides, I‚Äôm pretty sure dwarven relationships are way different from human ones. Sanon was entirely comfortable sleeping in the same place, so just chalked it up to modern humans being weird. I know that early humans had no problems doing this either, so I just went with it.

Behavioural differences aside, dwarves produce a lot of heat, for some reason. It made sleeping quite a bit easier, since there was a bit of a chill that night. I hadn‚Äôt really been expecting a chill, since the current region we were in had been pretty consistently warm up to that point.

Certainly a beautiful sight it was, though. The way the alien sky lit up, accented by the bioluminescence and mana of the various nocturnal lifeforms going about their lives. All sorts of creatures emerge at night in this region, some feathered, some furry. Many could emit light, and a few others were noisy. Max Jr. had been letting out the occasional chirping noise, presumably to attract a mate.

*Go for it buddy. Spread those genes‚Ä¶ or something. Ohhh wait nope nevermind I stand corrected.*

It turned out that he was luring in another creature by mimicking its calls. Fascinating.

I continued observing the local fauna for a while longer before drifting off to sleep, the Helsan sky watching over me.

\~\~\~

It was warm. Warm and inviting is how it felt. I could breathe too. There was air.

I opened my eyes and sat up. I had been sleeping on a plush leather couch of some kind. It was quite ornate.

My location had certainly changed. That‚Ä¶ or I was having another god dream. This felt way too lucid to just be a normal dream, so I assumed it was the latter. People don‚Äôt just get kidnapped without noticing, usually.

I looked around my current location. The warm, inviting feeling persisted, with the style of decor in the room only amplifying it. There was a fireplace situated in front of the couch, with a coffee table between the two. Off to the left of the fireplace was a desk with a number of strange apparatus strewn atop it. There was a chair, albeit with no one occupying it. The apparatus were of a bronze coloration, amongst them I spotted what looked to be rune brands, though I recognized none of the runes. I wasn‚Äôt an expert on language, but even I could tell they were different from the ones I had seen so far.

Before I had a chance to get up, though, a cup manifested in front of me. Within it was a black liquid, smelling distinctly of coffee.¬†

For the record, I want to find a way to synthesize coffee with magic, because this was just cruel. Helsa doesn‚Äôt even have coffee!

Complaints aside though, I eyed the coffee for a number of moments, before thinking *what‚Äôs the worst that could happen?*

I brought the cup to my lips, and sipped. Lo and behold, coffee indeed. It was rich, bitter, but not too bitter. This coffee was an anomaly. It was perfect. Too perfect, even. It certainly energized me, but not to the point that I got the jitters.

‚ÄúHm. Not bad. Not bad at all.‚Äù I said to no one.

‚ÄúWhy thank you, young human. Your praise does not go unnoticed.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh? This is already leagues better than my two previous encounters with the gods, so to whom do I owe the pleasure? My name is Max, by the way. But I‚Äôm sure you already know that.‚Äù

I heard a distinctly feminine giggle, though it had a mature, dignified air to it. ‚ÄúOh yes indeed, you are quite the perceptive one, Maximillian. You may simply refer to me as Kotsyanty‚Ä¶ or would it be the Goddess of Magic in your language? Yes yes I do believe so. Sometimes I do miss Language, that fellow.‚Äù

*Well she‚Äôs definitely more accommodating, if nothing else.*

‚ÄúI seem to be popular among the gods, for some reason‚Ä¶ may I ask why you‚Äôve chosen to hijack my dreams tonight?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh! Right to business then? I like it!‚Äù she purred. ‚ÄúWell! Let‚Äôs just say that I‚Äôve heard about your lack of presence from a little‚Ä¶ ah‚Ä¶ birdie? I do believe that‚Äôs what Evolution calls them. Anyway, Knowledge doesn‚Äôt know you‚Äôre here yet, and so I‚Äôve decided to take this opportunity to offer you a‚Ä¶ business proposal. Yes let‚Äôs call it that, shall we?‚Äù",1,1736387606.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

Finding a hotel in the northeast direction would be a wise choice. You really want to avoid peak traffic times and crowded areas, our taxi was stuck on the city highway 40mins during the traffic ....Fortunately, later a friend introduced someone who was a guide now part-time guiding us online.

Like any other major travel destination, it's easy to get caught up in crowded attractions filled with group tourists. However, there are also many hidden gems and peaceful places to explore. One location we enjoyed very much is Guozijian, a small temple with far fewer tourists compared to other famous sites. It features all the architectural elements you'd expect of traditional Chinese design and is close to a Hutong called Wudaoying, which is full of small stores and coffee shops. One coffee shop in this Wudaoying Hutong serves amazing espresso that I enjoyed a lot!

i didn't really pursue the guys who asked me out because one had politics that didn't align with mine (supporting carpetbagging candidates) and the other was nine years older than me so i thought it best to just stay fishing buddies. before being asked out a few times, i thought perhaps it was an attractiveness thing but i still get hit on, asked if i'm single, pretty privilege - especially at trader joe's for some reason - stared at when i'm out in ways that make me feel uncomfortable but i'd never compare stares or being called ""fun sized"" to my friends who were assaulted in elementary school or by their first boyfriend.

i have really great rolemodels in my male relatives and have had fulfilling friendship with guys since childhood, and i wouldn't mind marrying a man at all. the horrors just seem so real.

so, is it just me or are most girls affected in some way by 25?

also, for a young woman who has only been on dates and hasn't had penetrative sex or gotten into bed with guys just yet, what would your advice be? if you have any. i'd love to stay this way.

and there's a guy from my class last semester who i'd love to get to know better by asking him for coffee and/a walk in my favorite park. he already accepted my instagram request and requested me back fairly quickly. it seemed like he wanted to talk to me more in class but it was a hectic course. so hit me with the big girl advice.",0,1736386949.0,AskMenAdvice,24,0.5,False

I've been in this subreddit for awhile and always felt like my toddler does not sound ""normal"".","**Lack of independent play, extreme attachment to primary parent, and no interest in ""helping""; an antidote I see so much on here as this all encompassing toddler motivation that has never applied to my kid. I'm drowning.**

I'm a SAHP with an almost 2.5 year old that is extremely attached to me. I'm a former educator and think I've done a really good job for the first couple years of her life but the past few months I really really feel like I'm just failing.

Here is our usual day to day:

* This has waxed and waned to various degrees but my toddler really struggles playing independently. She literally has her own dedicated playroom with great toys and a ton of new Christmas toys and she will go in there for 2 minutes and 13 seconds in the morning, do some pretend play with her figurines or her vehicles and then come ask me to pick her up. Or ask me to come play with her. Which I do, but it's getting daunting going through the same schemes with her, engaging in the same scripts, and narrating the same stuff about her ice cream stand and the flavors she's feeding me. If I sound burned out I am, because I always have to be there engaging in her play, she won't do it on her own. Even when I am playing with her she's very easily frustrated if toys don't work correctly and it's hard to keep calm and just wait for the next wail because a lid didn't fit correctly. 
* If I try and sit down and drink coffee she screams. Eat a piece of burnt toast she screams. I can't even get 2 minutes to myself when we come downstairs without her needing me to come play with her. She's fed, hydrated, that's not the issue. 
* I generally turn on TV (quality, time limited) after playing with her for about 30 minutes. I need to eat and try and take some vitamins and maybe consider peeing. I literally cannot do those things without the TV. CANNOT. If she wants me/my attention and I hold firm on a no she will have a meltdown so bad that we have to go to her room and reset for 20 plus minutes. She won't sit with me while I eat, she will want down and for me to entertain her. 
* This has gotten so bad that I am having to take her somewhere every single morning because being home with her is absolute misery with constant whining, need for constant entertainment that still doesn't cut it for her, and a constant need to be held if she doesn't have my direct face to face attention. 
* Nap time I try and breathe and not move and pretend I don't exist for a few minutes. I then do my job while she sleeps. 
* She wakes up and we read some books in her room, maybe listen to some Yoto cards. Lunch and then try and get her to simply exist independently without me for as long as I can. Lately it's like 5 minutes maybe. When it doesn't work I happily play with her and try and push through the monotony and her constant frustration triggers. 
* We do a second round of TV in the late afternoon so I can prep dinner. Pretty much once the sun goes down she gets progressively better and by the time dinner is eaten and dad is home she is so much more likely to play independently and run around happily until bed. Sleeps great every night and always have, we are blessed here. 

Things I have tried:

Have her ""help"". She has never been interested in anything that looks like ""adult"" work. No interest. It's always been super hard to get her interested in day to day life like gardening, cooking, laundry, etc. I have tried engaging her in so many ways. No interest. She gets monthly visits from Early Intervention because she was born 3 months early and they are perplexed by this. She's very engaging otherwise, it's almost like she's a teenager. Very much self directed and not easily influenced by what we're doing, unless it seems relevant to her interests.

Vitamin D. B12. Has seemed to help some.

I know that teething has a big impact on her ability to be independent and she will definitely struggle more day to day, but this has been going on pretty consistently since she was about 1.

//////

She has been dad ambivalent since day 1. Always prefers me and is not excited or happy when he comes home. It's so bizarre because he's such a fun, loving, and engaging dad. It truly doesn't add up.

If anyone read this and sees spectrum flags, she was referred for an evaluation based on her sensory issues and the provider reading her as ""very sensitive"". Many of her traits would typically rule out a spectrum diagnosis ie; highly communicative and doesn't struggle with transitions. But we will see.

Am I the one that's just having a hard time? Am I just burned out and at the end of my rope? Or is my kid really really hard and needs some type of intervention? Please help, what am I doing wrong?",29,1736386719.0,toddlers,54,0.91,False

Something‚Äôs been on my mind lately, and I need to get it off my chest. I keep seeing Tunisians living their best lives abroad:

* **Parisians** sipping their ‚Ç¨5 coffees at chic caf√©s ‚Äì while reminiscing about ‚Äúthe good old days‚Äù at Caf√© Hloua in Tunis.
* **Londoners** enjoying free healthcare through the NHS ‚Äì but still swear by ‚ÄúTunisian home remedies‚Äù for every minor ailment.
* **Berliners** thriving in their careers and soaking up the European lifestyle ‚Äì while posting #TunisiaIsTheBest on Instagram from their Neuk√∂lln flat.
* **New Yorkers** climbing the corporate ladder on Wall Street ‚Äì but still argue that ‚ÄúTunisia‚Äôs job market just needs a little patience.‚Äù
* **Dubai expats** living in luxury skyscrapers ‚Äì while claiming ‚ÄúTunisia‚Äôs real estate is way more affordable and better.‚Äù
* **Montrealers** enjoying poutine and maple syrup ‚Äì but still insist that ‚ÄúTunisian cuisine is the only real food.‚Äù
* **Amsterdammers** biking through tulip fields ‚Äì while dreaming of the ‚Äúsimplicity‚Äù of Tunisian traffic.
* **Stockholmers** enjoying their fika breaks ‚Äì but still say Tunisian coffee is ‚Äúunmatched.‚Äù
* **Torontonians** braving the cold winters ‚Äì while claiming ‚ÄúTunisia‚Äôs weather is too hot anyway.‚Äù

‚Ä¶while simultaneously defending the *same system* they left behind back home üíÄ

**The math ain‚Äôt mathing:**

* ‚Äú*Tunisia is paradise!*‚Äù ‚Äì last visited for a 2-week vacation in 2015.
* ‚Äú*We don‚Äôt need foreign systems!*‚Äù ‚Äì happily uses Germany‚Äôs public transport and healthcare.
* ‚Äú*Our system works!*‚Äù ‚Äì hasn‚Äôt lived in Tunisia for 20+ years
* ‚Äú*Everything‚Äôs great there!*‚Äù ‚Äì but won‚Äôt move back, though
* ‚Äú*Tunisia is perfect!*‚Äù ‚Äì sent from a 2000$ Mac Paris
* ‚Äú*The economy is fine!*‚Äù ‚Äì works remotely for a European company to avoid Tunisian salaries.
* ‚Äú*Education back home is top-tier!*‚Äù ‚Äì sends their kids to international schools abroad.
* ‚Äú*Tunisia is so safe!*‚Äù ‚Äì lives in a gated community in Canada.
* ‚Äú*Our culture is unmatched!*‚Äù ‚Äì hasn‚Äôt celebrated Eid in Tunisia since 2010.
* ‚Äú*The government is doing its best!*‚Äù ‚Äì votes in Tunisian elections from the comfort of their Paris apartment.
* ‚Äú*We don‚Äôt need to change anything!*‚Äù ‚Äì renews their Schengen visa every year.
* ‚Äú*Life in Tunisia is so simple and fulfilling!*‚Äù ‚Äì spends summers in Hammamet but flies back to Europe before September.
* ‚Äú*Tunisians are so resilient!*‚Äù ‚Äì complains about the WiFi speed in their Berlin flat.

So, what‚Äôs the deal? Why praise a system you clearly chose *not* to live under? Is it nostalgia? Guilt? Or just cognitive dissonance? Let‚Äôs call it what it is: **The Political Schizophrenia of the Diaspora‚Ñ¢**.  
**Voting for the ‚ÄúLocal Dictator‚Äù:**No hate, just vibes and some honest questions. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

   * ‚Äú*Kais Saied is saving Tunisia!*‚Äù ‚Äì but conveniently lives in a country where they don‚Äôt have to deal with the consequences of his policies.
   * ‚Äú*He‚Äôs fighting corruption!*‚Äù ‚Äì while benefiting from a stable European banking system.
   * ‚Äú*He‚Äôs restoring dignity to Tunisia!*‚Äù ‚Äì but hasn‚Äôt stood in a 3-hour line for bread or gas in years.
1. **Double Standards in Criticism:**
   * ‚Äú*Tunisia‚Äôs democracy is fine!*‚Äù ‚Äì but wouldn‚Äôt dare give up their EU or Canadian passport.
   * ‚Äú*The opposition is ruining everything!*‚Äù ‚Äì while enjoying the freedom to protest and speak openly in their host country.
   * ‚Äú*We don‚Äôt need foreign intervention!*‚Äù ‚Äì but relies on foreign remittances to keep the economy afloat.
2. **Selective Nostalgia:**
   * ‚Äú*Tunisia was better before!*‚Äù ‚Äì but can‚Äôt name a single policy from the pre-2011 era that actually improved their life.
   * ‚Äú*We don‚Äôt need Western values!*‚Äù ‚Äì but sends their kids to schools that teach those same values.
   * ‚Äú*Tunisia‚Äôs culture is pure!*‚Äù ‚Äì but hasn‚Äôt lived there long enough to experience the daily struggles of preserving that culture.
3. **The Privilege of Distance:**
   * ‚Äú*Tunisia just needs time!*‚Äù ‚Äì says the person who hasn‚Äôt paid taxes or dealt with bureaucracy there in decades.
   * ‚Äú*The youth are too impatient!*‚Äù ‚Äì while their own kids are studying abroad and building careers in stable economies.
   * ‚Äú*Everything will work out!*‚Äù ‚Äì but has a backup plan to stay abroad indefinitely.

**Discussion Points:**

1. Do you think this is a form of coping mechanism for being away from home?
2. Is it fair to critique Tunisia‚Äôs system while enjoying the benefits of living abroad?
3. For those who *have* moved back, what‚Äôs your perspective on this?
4. Is it hypocritical to support leaders like Kais Saied while living abroad and not facing the consequences of their policies?
5. Should the diaspora have a say in Tunisia‚Äôs politics if they don‚Äôt plan to return?
6. How can Tunisians abroad contribute constructively without falling into the trap of double standards?

## The Importance of Your Yoga Shirt

A seemingly simple garment, the yoga shirt plays a surprisingly crucial role‚Äç in your overall practice experience. Here‚Äôs why ‚Äçit‚Äôs vital to choose carefully:

### Freedom of Movement

Yoga requires a ‚Å§wide range of‚Äã motion ‚Äì‚Äã from deep stretches to dynamic‚Äã flow sequences.A restrictive shirt‚Äç can hinder your ability to move ‚Å£fully into poses, possibly leading to strain or discomfort.Look‚Å£ for yoga shirts designed with‚Äå flexibility in mind, allowing you to effortlessly transition between‚Å£ asanas. The ‚Å£best yoga shirts offer a balance of structure and give.

### Sweat-Wicking Performance

whether you‚Äôre practicing in a hot studio or a warm room, perspiration is certain. Fabrics that trap moisture can ‚Äåleave you feeling clammy and uncomfortable. Breathable, moisture-wicking materials are ‚Äãessential for‚Äå keeping you‚Äã dry and cool throughout ‚Å£your practice. This helps to regulate your ‚Äåbody temperature and keeps you focused. ‚ÄåThis is particularly crucial for those in ‚Å¢dynamic‚Å¢ or hot yoga ‚Äãclasses.

### Confidence and Comfort

your yoga shirt shouldn‚Äôt just facilitate movement; it should also make you feel‚Å£ good. A well-fitting shirt that flatters your body can boost your confidence and allow you to ‚Å¢fully embrace your practice. Comfort is a non-negotiable factor.An‚Å§ ill-fitting or itchy ‚Å£garment can become a constant distraction, drawing your attention away from the present moment.### Durability

Yoga clothing frequently enough undergoes frequent washing and movement. A‚Äå high-quality yoga shirt should be durable enough ‚Äãto withstand regular wear‚Äå and tear, retaining its shape, fit, and performance qualities for the long term. Investing in a shirt made with durable fabrics will save money in the long run and ‚Å£reduce the frequency with which you need to repurchase athletic wear.

Settle in, this is a long one. All names have been changed.

I (21, F) have been in a relationship with Adam (20, M) for a little over 7 months now‚Ä¶ yeah, i know very well that is not a long time. We met through a mutual friend (Summer, 20, F) around 10 months ago. A little context, me and Summer have been friends for 5 years, we met online and coincidentally lived super close to each other and started hanging out, the rest is history. Summer became one of my best friends and then 10 months ago she introduced me to Adam, we became friends and then more than friends.

After a good few dates, Adam and i took a step forward into being more serious and introduced each other to family and friends. This is where Matthew comes into it. Matthew (21, M) is Adam‚Äôs best friend and they‚Äôve known each other around 17 years. Now, i knew right away, Matthew was not my cup of tea‚Ä¶ he was loud and seemed to want all eyes on him, he‚Äôs the kind of guy to force out ridiculously loud burps in the middle of dinner at a restaurant and tell you to rate them out of 10 and, i don‚Äôt think im the only one who thinks this way but, that‚Äôs just gross. Regardless, i wanted to be able to get along with Matthew because it was important to Adam. 

Adam wanted me and Matthew to meet at a pub and, for the sake of it not being quite as awkward, we brought summer along too, surprisingly summer and matthew really liked each other and they start dating too. I like to consider myself an optimist and that‚Äôs why i genuinely thought this was great, Summer and I are best friends and we‚Äôre dating best friends, infinite double dates and group plans‚Ä¶ yeah i was dead wrong. 

Shit doesn‚Äôt hit the fan right away, however around 2 weeks after Summer and Matty got together, we made plans to go to the cinema, Matty was coming to pick me and Adam up and we were meeting Summer there. While on our way to meet her, Matthew decides to turn to me and say (verbatim) ‚Äòi‚Äôm surprised you and Adam are together, he usually has pretty high standards‚Äô and he says this IN FRONT OF MY BOYFRIEND!!!! And what does my boyfriend do, laugh. laugh is what he does. I was in shock, i literally didn‚Äôt say a word. 

This started a sort of pattern, almost every time Matthew and I were around each other, he would make snide remarks or criticisms about me and my boyfriend wouldn‚Äôt say a word. I felt completely lost on what i could possibly do. Summer is dating Matthew and seems to really like him so i don‚Äôt want to cause issues between them, and Adam has told me in no uncertain terms that if a girlfriend tried to get between him and his best friend, he would leave. 

I barely saw Summer anymore because she was always, ALWAYS with Matthew. I tried to set up a little coffee date with her so we could catch up and i arrive, only to see Matty sitting right next to her. I barely spoke for the 2 hours we were there. Then i start noticing changes in Summer. She was always so sweet and shy and it was like pulling teeth trying to get her to talk to people, now if a girl happens to brush past Matthew as she moves around him, Summer will snap and say something like ‚Äòget your own boyfriend, he‚Äôs mine!‚Äô

So to put it simply over the course of a few months, Matthew has insulted me and made me incredibly self conscious and (yes, i know it‚Äôs not directly his fault but still) completely changed my best friend. Now, I had told Adam about this multiple times, explained as best i can how Matthew makes me feel, how i am left feeling less than and not enough when we hang out as a group‚Ä¶ Adam is well aware of everything and had supposedly spoken with Matthew about it multiple times‚Ä¶ nothing changed.

One major issue that only made the situation worse happened in September. Summer and i have had lengthy discussions about a health condition she has, it‚Äôs not life threatening but it causes her an incredible amount of pain, i know all about this. The situation still isn‚Äôt completely clear but I‚Äôll try to make this simple. Summer confided in Matthew about something relating to the condition that she tells him to not tell anyone else, Matthew calls Adam and tells him about it (neglecting to mention that he was supposed to keep it to himself), Adam assumes i already know and mentions it in front of me, I assume Summer had noticed we had drifted apart and didn‚Äôt know if she could confide in me about this but that i was allowed to know, I speak to summer about it. Now, understandably, Summer is not happy that her trust was violated by Matthew and confronts him about it. Matthew then calls Adam, screaming about how i need to keep my mouth shut and keep out of other people‚Äôs business. I will hold my hands up and say, yeah, hind sight is 2020 and i was maybe in the wrong for mentioning it before Summer could tell me herself but i can‚Äôt turn back time so if i truly made my bed, i will lie in it. But this was the first major moment where my opinion on Matthew was solidified.

There‚Äôs then another situation that truly enraged me, however since i was made to be the bad guy in the previous situation i haven‚Äôt mentioned to Summer but i probably should‚Äôve. As i said, Summer has a health condition that causes her almost constant pain, she has been back and forth to doctors and hospitals to try and get help. Because of this, she had not yet been intimate with Matthew, something i found out about, accidentally, when he called Adam and since my boyfriend was busy, he put the call on speaker phone. I hear, loud and clear, Matthew saying the most disgusting thing i have ever heard in regard to intimacy‚Ä¶ ‚Äòi mean, im a guy, i have needs and i spend all this money on her and get nothing back.‚Äô I was gobsmacked. what disturbed me even more was my lovely boyfriend trying to defend Matthew‚Äôs words when the call ended. From that moment, i knew i despised Matthew and i became terrified. I‚Äôve already seen how much Summer has changed and now im worrying what kind of influence Matthew could have over Adam.

The big blow up happened around christmas. So, again, Matthew had been criticizing me, saying i‚Äôm not putting in enough effort with Summer. ‚ÄòOkay, fine. I will make plans to meet up with her and exchange gifts for christmas, we can have some food and maybe a couple drinks.‚Äô We make these plans a week into November. December 10th rolls around and Matthew decides to message our little group chat and says ‚Äòwe need to pick another day to exchange gifts, me and Summer have made plans‚Äô. To put it simply, i‚Äôm frustrated and exhausted. He said all these things about me not being a good enough friend and not putting in effort but then he, in 1 sentence, invites himself to said plans that were only for me and Summer, and also, cancels plans he had no hand in making. I admit i may have sort of been an asshole, i got a little snappy. i then say ‚Äòit‚Äôs fine, whatever. we can just do another day.‚Äô yes, that message clearly shows that im fuming but they already knew that and i thought i would cool off and just let him win. He decides to ridicule me, saying how im throwing a fit and being bitchy and so on and so on. Matthew does this in a group chat with both my supposed best friend and my boyfriend, neither of which try to defend me. so‚Ä¶ i lose it. i type out a simple but very effective message and hit send. the message read ‚Äògo fuck yourself.‚Äô 

All hell broke loose, Matthew starts blowing up Adam‚Äôs phone ‚Äòim not having that!‚Äô ‚Äòshe can‚Äôt speak to me like that‚Äô ‚Äòi deserve to be respected‚Äô ‚Äòi would never talk to her like that‚Äô and so much more bullshit. i send Summer a simple message and say ‚Äòhey, im sorry. didn‚Äôt mean to put you in an awkward position, im frustrated but it still wasn‚Äôt fair to you, we will plan another day‚Äô. Me and Summer are absolutely fine. Matthew is still frantically messaging Adam. The situation turns into this, Me telling Adam how i would respond to messages, Adam telling Matthew ‚Äòshe said‚Ä¶‚Äô, and Matthew responding to what i say. what i didn‚Äôt know at the time was that Adam was censoring everything that i told him to say in order to not hurt Matthew‚Äôs feelings. In case any of you need a reminder‚Ä¶ Matthew is 21 years of age. He is a big boy, he should be able to handle being criticized for his behavior. I only found this out because i wanted to read a very lengthy message from Matthew rather than Adam read it out, i tried to take the phone to read it and Adam starts trying to hide the phone from me, whether it was to hide the fact he had been rewording my thoughts and feelings so they were more palatable for Matthew or if it was to ensure i don‚Äôt send Matthew any messages that were too harsh, i still don‚Äôt know, but i do know that i was enraged. Eventually, the situation dies down after i agree to ‚Äòstart over‚Äô with Matthew, but i then have a long conversation with Adam about how i understand that his best friend is a huge priority to him but i need to be one of his priorities also, about how im hurt that he would edit my feeling to save Matthew for getting hurt but Matthew had been treating me terribly and Adam has never come to my defense. Adam really seemed to have understood me and swore up and down that he would keep an eye on it. 

Obviously, the peace didn‚Äôt last more than a couple weeks, eventually we all meet up to exchange gifts and it‚Äôs fine‚Ä¶ until Matthew makes a tiny comment. it wasn‚Äôt enough for me to feel justified in calling him out but it still bothered me. 

Me and Adam have been discussing redecorating his flat however i mentioned how we could maybe move to our own place because even though he has been very welcoming since i moved in, it still feels like Adam‚Äôs home and im just staying there. Now, i will say, this wouldn‚Äôt be happening just yet. We talked about the things we would like to do to his flat and the money we would need to save and we wouldn‚Äôt be able to make any of those changes until around July/August time, and the changes would cost more than to put money together to get a slightly bigger place for us both and have a couple months rent saved too. By the time any of this happens, we will have been together over a year. 

This was brought up by Adam and Matthew is very quick to piss in our cereal. He tells us ‚Äòwoah, don‚Äôt rush into anything, you might break up and then you‚Äôll be stuck.‚Äô and yeah, maybe it was just him being concerned that his friend was moving too quickly but again, we would have been together over a year at that point and the way he said it, it truly felt like he was hoping we would break up. Then, he pulls Adam to a side, not long after that, and tell him how upset he is, how he feels as though, since i became Adam‚Äôs girlfriend, he doesn‚Äôt see him anymore. Need i explain why that feels like he‚Äôs trying to blame me for the distance starting to grow in the friendship‚Ä¶ yeah, i didn‚Äôt think so. Just in case any commenters want to accuse me of causing them to drift apart, i actively encourage Adam and Matthew to hang out, i just don‚Äôt want to be a part of it.

Back to the point, like i said, i didn‚Äôt say anything but i just feel so done. we said we would ‚Äòstart over‚Äô and already we have another little comment. 

Now that most of the back ground and important information is done, let‚Äôs get on to the reason i wrote this out and am asking for your advice. Adam‚Äôs birthday is in May and his mum (we will call her Kat) and his aunt (who we will call Lindsay) were discussing going on a trip to celebrate. Now, I love Kat and I love Lindsay. They are truly awesome and i have felt so welcomed by them both. They were thinking of places we could visit and decided on a city a little ways away but not super far from where me live, and let me stress this, they were planning a trip for 4‚Ä¶ Lindsay, Kat, Adam and Me. As soon as it‚Äôs mentioned, Adam says ‚Äòwell Matthew will have to come too‚Äô which, to put it simply, is my idea of hell. We would be stuck in a completely new city, miles upon miles away from home, with no escape from each other, for a whole weekend. And to rub salt into the wound, we would be drinking. I can only speak for myself on this but I would rather die than be in that situation with Matthew. 

I tried to have a chat with Adam about maybe doing something with Matthew before or after the trip but he wasn‚Äôt interested, even Kat‚Ä¶ ADAMS MOTHER!!! tried to dissuade her son from including Matthew in the plans (i haven‚Äôt told Kat anything about how Matthew has treated me at this point so she definitely didn‚Äôt say this for my sake) but Adam seemed insistent. 

I have now been sitting on this for a couple of days and i‚Äôm starting to think i need to have a lengthy conversation with Adam. The way i see it, i would never ever put Adam, the man i love, in a situation where i knew he would feel uncomfortable and unwanted. I would never want him to feel like an outsider when he is with me, so why is it okay for Adam to put me in a position, that he knows very well, i‚Äôd feel uneasy and like i would rather be anywhere else in the world. 

So on to my ultimatum, I want to tell Adam, that either I go with him on the trip, or Matthew goes with him, but if he chooses Matthew, i can‚Äôt promise he will have a girlfriend when he gets back. The issue is, i don‚Äôt want him to feel obligated to choose me because he doesn‚Äôt want to break up but the whole time he secretly wishes Matthew was with him. I also, can‚Äôt say with complete honesty that i could trust my boyfriend when Matthew is with him‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt go into detail but i know far more than i would like to about their ‚Äòlads holiday‚Äô and the things they both got up to, and i don‚Äôt know if i could actually handle them going on another without suffering with crippling anxiety because im not there to make sure nothing happens. So yeah, i don‚Äôt know if i could stomach sending my boyfriend on a trip with his terrible influence of a best friend, who (i will remind you) has been very vocal about his dislike for me, has spoken freely about how he‚Äôs not happy that his girlfriend didn‚Äôt have sex with him after only 3 months of knowing her, despite how much money he threw at her, and who i know likes to drink and party and do things that many would be more cautious about. 

There‚Äôs also the whole, why should i have to issue an ultimatum for my boyfriend to actually consider my feelings and put me first for once. I‚Äôm not blindsiding him with this, he knows everything that Matthew has said and done and why i don‚Äôt like him and he should have the brain capacity to understand that i wouldn‚Äôt want to be in that situation. 

What‚Äôs truly mind boggling to me is that, him mum and aunt are planning a short trip for his birthday, an ‚Äòunofficial‚Äô family trip, and his first instinct is to invite his best friend, like why is that even something that crosses your mind? 

I do love my boyfriend, very very much, and i see myself living a very happy life with him, but it just feels like this is a look into what the rest of my life will be like if i stay with Adam and never put my foot down. My very good friend said, he‚Äôs a good boyfriend and he excels at the easy stuff, the gift giving and the affection and the words of affirmation, but he‚Äôs not very good at the hard stuff, the talking things through, the working through issues, making tough decisions. I don‚Äôt want people to read this post and think he‚Äôs a bad person, he‚Äôs not. 

I don‚Äôt want Adam to think he has to choose between me and Matthew, but at the same time, it feels like he kind of does have to choose. He swore to me that he would make me a priority and start putting me first every now and then, but nothing has changed and my feelings are still brushed to the side. Adam is a man who i would love to marry one day, but right now, the only thing i can picture when i think about us getting married is me walking down the aisle to see Adam, with Matthew right next to him, just constantly there, constantly making me feel small and insignificant. It would kill me to lose him, but i just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

Please, i‚Äôm happy to accept my judgement, if im the asshole, then i‚Äôm the asshole. All i ask is that you give me some advice on how to handle this because i can‚Äôt keep doing this, it‚Äôs killing me. ",2,1736385389.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,14,1.0,False

I have my coffee in the morning , I dont have breakfast , I don't have lunch , i eat dinner around 5 ish to 7 at the latest . I'm not really hungry ever . And i read i might be fasting but screwing up my metabolism . Is it better to eat breakfast and riding those calories until dinner ? Should i not worry about it as long as I'm still losing weight ?

Anything reviewed below 4.5 in my area is not worth it in my opinion. I am not trying pizza.

Surreal $4.99 A random item on the menu based on what is leftover. I got a sandwich which I could have made at home.

Chicken Salad Chick $5.99 Egg Salad and Salad oddly enough no chicken salad.

Cerritos $5.99 comes with one container of soup rice meat and wraps the $6.99 is the same sans two containers of soup. The meat and rice were not great but may vary

Rockland and Grilling Company $7.99 just meats and sides you need to use a bot to get it sadly as they snatch it up really quickly. Literally took me weeks to get a bag due to damn bots snatching them all up. They drop bags at 8:15 and 9:15 PM depending on the day.

‚ÄãLa Tingeria $3.99 meat, rice, beans, chips and sour cream. It can be missing chips, beans‚Äã ‚Äãand or sour cream.

Cava $4.99 is just a basic meal at least the Chantilly, Va store near Wegman's. They make a bowl and don't let you customize anymore after corporate stated not to apparently. Small wait time

Peet's Coffee is just pastries got six pieces for $3.99. Just pick up.

Rawal Kabob for $4.99 is just a meal both times I tried it. I loved the food given but the quantity isn't anything to write home about. A small wait time.

Saltenas Camila for $5.99 small wait time if early. They are offering breads with fillings. It honestly isn't worth it. They give out 4 per bag and an actual order costs $4.25 for 2 for one kind or $3.5 for three another kind. Your better off buying it normally. When the Chantilly store offered bags it was a random meal on their menu.

Moby Dick House of Kabob for $3.99 is just a basic meal. Someone keeps snatching them up ASAP but the two times I got to pick them up they were just a standard meal offering from their menu. Small wait time.

Bobby's Bagel Cafe is just 12 bagels and two containers of cream cheese. The pretzel bagels are really salty. No wait time just pickup.

Fairfax Bakery was just bagels and some pastries. Wasn't as good as Bobby's but acceptable. Small wait time

Jas and Fam Caribbean Flavor. A ton of rice and not much meat or vegetables not worth it to me. Comes with a Sandwich as well. 10 minute wait time

Chi Mc is plain chicken wings which you have to pay for sauce and a side of white rice. It isn't to bad sauce costs $1.5.

King's Buffet is a random assortment of food from the buffet in a standard container they use. Think white Styrofoam container. Small wait time while they pick your food. If you bring a soup container you can grab some soup. You can also request the removal or addition of some items.

Rasa is just a basic bowl. Small wait time during assembly or no wait time if you come late as they are already made.

Whole Foods bakery is random items that are nearing out of date. I got 3 items.

Whole Foods prepared foods is random one of the four bags I had had a salad, mac and cheese and a pizza. Another had wings, salad and crackers. Another had a flat bread wings and cheese platter with grapes and brownie. The final had the same cheese platter, with a salad and lo mein. Overall only two were worth it. The salads were small, pizza was fairly large, flatbread was large, wings were only 10-12 in number didn't bother counting but they were small and haven't opened them all yet, cheese platter was small and not worth it and the crackers within were stale and the Lo Mein was small. Pickup was at customer service desk. The other time I went was fried chicken, soup and wraps.

Anna Sudha Community Kitchen is a basic meal with some extras. Well worth the $5. Small wait time while they package it.

PLNT Burger is a basic meal, burger and fries at $4 unsure if random. Small wait time.

Armored Fresh is vegan cheese. I can't really make a judgement if it is worth it since I don't eat many Vegan items but at $4 it is well worth it I think. Think American cheese slices. Just pick up and go.

Fava Pot is a basic meal at $5 of a ton of carbs rice beans onions or a veggie fava bean sauce with wraps. Just pickup and go.

Siroo and Jukstory $4.99 for an assortment of baked goods and prepared food. It is random based on what is going to expire. They already have it bagged. They drop an additional bags at 5:55PM which can be 0-12 depending on what they have expiring for the day.

Mas Seafood is raw seafood which mine had fish. Small wait time.

Area 2 Farms $14.99 for an a wide array of vegetables and herbs. You can pick it up or tour the place. I toured the place personally.

Ikea $4.99 a random meal tried twice once was just mac and cheese the other was meatballs with sides. Your better off buying a meal on Tuesday for $3.99 since it is cheaper and won't be random.

Flavor Hive $4.99 is a random item on their menu. Wait till while they make it.

Meaza $5.99 is a large wrap with toppings. Wait time 5-10 minutes while they make it.

City Kabob House is chicken and rice not worth the price at all. $9.99 for a basic meal with no sides versus their actual menu which includes sides for a bit more. $6.99 veggies are not worth it as well. They cook it so small wait time.

Prime Halal is a bunch of rice and little meat been twice. $6.99 and not worth it at all. They cook it.

Dig Inn $4.99 Basic bowl random based on what is left over. Issue is sometimes they overcook ingredients near the end and it may be burned and you cannot customize it.

Nene's Soul Cafe is Meaza a large wrap with toppings. Unsure why it lacked Soul Food. They cancel orders all the time as well for some reason.

Saltenas Canitas Chantilly $5.99 basic meal from their menu long wait time

Kabob Grill is $5.99 basic meal only sold on Fridays for some odd reason. It is random small wait time.",11,1736385181.0,toogoodtogo,5,0.93,False

Forget meal plans or splurging on fancy restaurants‚Äîyour shopping list consists of air. Savings galore!

Social Life? Overrated.
No awkward splitting-the-bill moments when you don‚Äôt go out. Plus, no friends or boyfriends means no birthday gifts, no dinner parties, and no ‚Äúlet‚Äôs grab coffee‚Äù expenses.

Clothing Costs? Pennies!
Clearance aisle and kids‚Äô section for the win! While others are dropping hundreds on trendy outfits, you‚Äôre rocking those ¬£3 leggings made for an 11-year-old.

No Sports, No Problem!
No gym memberships, no sporting events, no overpriced stadium snacks‚Äîwho needs muscles when you‚Äôve got those razor-sharp collarbones?

Concerts? Too Tiring.
Standing for hours screaming lyrics? Pass. That ¬£200 Taylor Swift ticket can stay in someone else‚Äôs cart.

Travel Savings:
Flights? Nope. Energy to leave the house? Also nope. Your biggest adventure is walking from the bedroom to the kitchen (and back again).

Water Bills Are So Last Year!
Showers are overrated. Think of all the savings (and the environment)!

No Birth Control Needed!
Infertility: the ultimate money-saver. Say goodbye to prescriptions, condoms, and awkward pharmacy visits.

Electricity Savings!
You‚Äôre always cold, so the heating is set to ‚Äúmaximum tundra,‚Äù but you‚Äôve offset that by never turning on the lights since you live in bed.

Starbucks Inflation? Avoided.
No ¬£5 oat milk lattes when you‚Äôre scared of liquid calories. Your bank account thanks you for the dry mouth.

Birthdays and Holidays? Skipped.
Can‚Äôt attend celebrations if you‚Äôre avoiding the cake. No parties, no gifts, no awkward Secret Santa exchanges.

Health Insurance? Optional.
Who needs regular check-ups? Your body‚Äôs a medical mystery, and you‚Äôre saving thousands by not addressing it. 

Cleaning Supplies? Nah.
No mess to clean up when you barely move, and no dishes to wash when you don‚Äôt eat. Sparkling savings!

Books and Hobbies? Who Cares?
Reading, painting, or anything requiring concentration? Ha, good one. You‚Äôre too exhausted to care, which means fewer random Amazon purchases.
