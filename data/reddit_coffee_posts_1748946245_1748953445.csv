1l2afox,https://v.redd.it/129usjiifp4f1,Coffee flipper dispensers. Yay or nay?,"Does anyone else use coffee dosing dispensers (no idea what they are actually called) for their moka pots?

I picked one up a long time ago and prefer using it over weighing or scooping - simply for how quick and mess free it is. It basically scoops the same amount of coffee into the filter basket every time so the results are quite repeatable. I wouldn't doubt that weighing is more accurate though.

  
Been having fun tinkering with a 3D printer recently and thought I'd redesign it with some improvements in mind, thought I'd share with you all. Made it screw on to the generic metal coffee jars and also able to reuse the same jar lid to keep everything tidy.  If anyone has ever used one of these for single doses/without a jar you'd know how annoying the dead spaces between the scoop and the top is - so I got rid of it.

Been using it to quite some success although I wish I had picked more neutral colours. And yes, plastic and food but oh well I just wanted to share and get your opinions on these dispensers in general.",1,1748953218.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

1l2afij,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1l2afij/aita_for_abandoning_my_friend_for_cheating_on_her/,AITA for ‘abandoning’ my friend for cheating on her boyfriend even though she says she ‘didn’t do anything to me’?,"Sorry, this is going to be a long one! >< I just really needed to get this off my chest. Made an alt for this bc I’ve been thinking about saying this for a while but a lot of my friends know my main.

So I (24F) have been friends with this girl (24F) let’s call her Amelia, since we were both teenagers. We became friends in middle school because we found out we had common interests, and I thought she was a really fun person to be around. Amelia has always been the ‘star of the show’, the kind of girl with ‘quirky’ interests who relishes in being different. I don’t say this in a negative way at all, really—I loved her for how much she didn’t seem to care about other people’s opinions. 

However, I was also the only one of her friends to acknowledge that she had some flaws that made her behave… well, irresponsibly towards us sometimes. She would constantly bail on or be late to meetings because she wanted to do something else more and she tended to be very oblivious to people’s feelings.

I kind of became the damage control friend over time. I’d tell people that she didn’t mean it, that she had issues with planning. All of which was somewhat true, because Amelia had ADHD. To be clear, I never saw anything wrong with that. I would constantly ask our friends for patience, to not get too mad at her, and help her get out of problems.

Entering adulthood, I had a really bad breakup with my ex, who had started cheating on me with a friend of mine, Katrina, and blamed me for it because I was asexual and too career focused (neither of which were things that I had hidden before we started dating.) During this time, I had a few friends who supported me, but Amelia was mostly absent. When she came back after I had gotten out of my mental health spiral, she claimed that she just didn’t want to take sides and invite that energy into her life, when she was so busy with university and her new boyfriend, James (25M). I was just so happy to have her back that I didn’t say anything about it. We just started hanging out again, though she went overseas and started ignoring my messages then.

Sorry for the lengthy context, but it’s all pretty necessary for understanding what happened. One month ago, Amelia broke up with James out of the blue. James sort of went quiet about it, not badmouthing her to anyone. I asked Amelia and she told me evasively that it was just differences in opinion about the future. 

It felt off to me, so I approached a mutual friend, Heather (24F), for more details. She had approached James after the breakup because she was worried about his mental health. (To be clear, Heather’s happily in a relationship. This was just her being a sweetie.)

Heather was a little hesitant, but eventually, she told me over a lunch coffee that she didn’t think she wanted to hang out with Amelia anymore. I was startled by this, and the old instinct to make excuses for my friend came up, but then I thought about the weird expression she’d made when I’d asked her about James. I suppressed that instinct and asked Heather to explain more.

This was where I learned that Amelia had mentioned to Heather that she had cheated on James. Apparently, for over a year, overseas, while at university. She’d come back home to her boyfriend, told him this, told him that she’d simply felt like she was just settling with him because he was the safe option, but that he wasn’t handsome enough or rich enough for her.

There’s no way, I thought immediately. Amelia wouldn’t do that. It had to be a misunderstanding. But Heather wouldn’t lie either.

As one might expect, I went to talk to Amelia after this. When she learned I’d found out, she got defensive immediately, claiming that she’d just fallen in love.

To be clear, I didn’t take an aggressive stance. Just sat at her dining table, asking her questions gently, stressing that I didn’t want to judge her based on other people’s stories, that I wanted to hear the events from her mouth.

Honestly? Maybe staying with Heather’s version might have been better.

She told me that she had gotten bored of James, who had always mentioned that he just wanted to live a normal life with her. She said that she had strung him along for a year because it felt too cold to break up over a text. She said that I should understand, that she had ADHD, that she could procrastinate on things sometimes, that as a fellow neurodivergent person, I should empathise with her and not give her a hard time over it.

(I don’t remember the exact words we said, so I’m sorry if I write this next part too formally.)

Me: “I’m not giving you a hard time and I’m not going to gossip. I just wanted to know why.”

Amelia: “You’ve broken up before. You should understand when a guy’s just not right for you.”

Me: “We’re not here to talk about me right now… And if you’d just directly told James that and broken up with him, I wouldn’t have criticised that. I came here hoping to hear that you didn’t actually cheat on him, but I guess I was wrong.”

This is where I got up to leave. Amelia seemed to sense something was wrong, but her next words surprised me.

Amelia: “so, what are you going to tell Heather and the others? They haven’t been talking to me recently.”

Me: “… talk to them?”

Amelia: “yeah, to get them to stop being mad at me.”

Me: “I can’t really blame them…”

Amelia: “what does that mean?”

I went quiet here, trying to figure out how to say my next words. I struggle a lot in the moment. However, then, Amelia started going on a tirade about James.  How he was stealing all her friends, how once people heard about this, instead of understanding how hard it had been for her to break up with him, they all just started to ignore her. I sat there, getting more and more anxious, until I finally cut her off.

Me: “What you’re saying is awful, Amelia… James didn’t even say anything. You did. To be honest, I’m… not happy with you for that either. It’s not fair to him. And cheating is something I can’t ignore.”

She looked at me, and then accused me of betraying her. Saying that I was always supposed to be on her side and proving that she was correct and that people just weren’t being accommodating of her. When I didn’t immediately apologise, she said something awful to me.

Amelia: “You got together with someone super quickly too after your breakup! And like, the two of you looked so happy together that I thought I deserved that too! [New boyfriend] makes me feel that way! But if you’re just gonna get mad at me, then maybe this proves that you and Evan (25NB) aren’t as solid as you think you are, because you’re still hung up over your ex!”

I’m not proud of what happened next, but I lost it. I yelled at her that I had started dating Evan two years after my breakup, after recovering from everything before, and that she hadn’t been there, that she’d been taking Instagram photos with Katrina (the girl my ex cheated with) during that time, that she had no right to question my relationship or blame me, that she had done exactly what my ex had done to me despite knowing how devastated I was, that she had blamed everyone in her life but herself for being a cheater, that she had weaponised my old breakup to hurt me right now so that I would excuse her actions again. I said I wanted nothing to do with her anymore.

I left after that. I didn’t say anything to anyone, but apparently, Amelia called someone to complain about me, and the whole story got out. Most people have cut her off, which made her freak out. She kept spamming me with messages, claiming that I’d destroyed her social life even though she had never done anything to me, that it was unfair to be mad at her for her actions towards someone else. One of our mutual friends texted me accusing me of ‘siding with a man’ over Amelia. I know I shouldn’t doubt myself, and Evan tells me they’re relieved that I stood up for myself instead of letting her use me as a shield, but I can’t help being worried that it might have been too much. I just want to know people’s opinions on it, if perhaps I’m the asshole for being too confrontational when it came to how I spoke to her… so um, Reddit, AITA?",1,1748953203.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,0,1.0,False

1l2aehs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_gezza12/comments/1l2aehs/strengthening_security_and_shaping_the_future/,Strengthening Security and Shaping the Future NFC-Based Micropayment Systems in 2025,"1. The Mobile Payment Inflection Point

Quietly, NFC technology has become the backbone of thousands if not millions of daily transactions within recent years. Paying for a coffee, or tapping your phone to board the subway—these tiny moments of seamlessness are enabled by an intricate framework working in milliseconds. With the world believe entering into 2025, there could not be a better need than to evaluate these systems as safe. The escalating rate of digital transactions have outpaced the advances in security risks performed concurrently with technology.

 

2. What Exactly Is NFC?

At its most basic function, NFC enables communication between two devices within a few inches of each other — usually a smartphone and payment terminal. Because it is contactless, faster and does not require a physical swipe, NFC technology has become widely adopted for mobile payments. The tech uses electromagnetic radio fields and is based on ISO/IEC 14443, as well as FeliCa. NFC is much faster and less setup on the part of the user than a QR code, or even Bluetooth.

 

3. Current approaches to security won't cut it come 2025

Malicious actors are following the growing global offerings of NFC-based payments and have adapted their tactics. Here in 2025, attackers can compromise a system without ever securing physical access to it. Major threats for mobile: MALWARE (Especially on Mobile)TOKEN THEFTRELAY ATTACKS Identifying and reducing these risks will do much to determine the future of mobile payment.

 

This brings us to our main question: can we still trust that [휴대폰 소액결제 가능 여부](https://zeropaybank.com/) is not prevented by a vulnerability lurking beneath?

 

4. The failures of NFC payments to date

Known Vulnerabilities Exposed

 

Relay Attacks: That use devices to where it sits between two NFC device, and then coherence the attack; doing potential theft transaction.

 

Anyone — If your phone you leave is vulnerable (no biometric lock, etc), anyone can initiate an NFC transaction.

 

Unencrypted Data – Low-security applications still use the NFC data in plain text and makes it easier to sniff.

 

Token manipulation -- Even though tokenization is designed to prevent fraudulent transactions, a criminal can use fake tokens if he manages to breach the system that generates and validates them.

5. How to Make NFC Payments Secure

Not all is doom and gloom. By being used intelligently, NFC transactions can be one of the safest payment methods. Here's how to get there:

 

1) Device-level Authentication Enablement

Every transaction should include biometric checks, multi-factor authentication (MFA), as well as contextual validation such location-based approvals.

 

2) Real-Time Logging of Threats

Security systems need to be more than just record-and-replay; they should leverage machine learning for real time anomaly detection and prediction.

 

3) E2E Encryption and Token Rotation

Unfortunately, encrypting a transaction once just doesn't cut it. Rolling tokens possibly expiring quickly that cannot be reused: should payment systems use these as the ideal type?

 

4) Cross-Platform Validation

When NFC transactions are tied with digital IDs or decentralized identity systems you have a larger verification layer that is separate from the payment platform.

 

6. Real-World Examples from 2025

And some companies started making the adjustment already:

 

Iris scanning for Samsung PayㄴNFC region by iris scanning was applied to a high-fraud area.

 

In 2012 Google Wallet added an Offline Mode with time-limited tokens for use at places that have less than optimal network connectivity.

 

Both Stripe & Square have been using fraud engines with AI at the core which can stop a transaction halfway if it finds any risk.

 

7. A Die-Hard the Steps for Tech Users & Developers

For users:

 

Use biometric authentication, always.

 

Turn off NFC when not in use.

 

Keep Payment Apps Updated Fix your payment apps regularly.

 

Avoid touching uninsulated NFC (Subway without encryption).

 

For developers and providers:

 

Enforce adaptive\_auth and sohemian/encsy as engine. ! (/authentication issued)

 

Detect anomalous transactions using behavioral analytics.

 

Conduct regular monthly penetration tests

 

When a high valued NFC transaction is made, do user notification.

8. NFC-Based Systems Pros and Cons

Convenience and productivity are any NFC user's best friend, but those traits can turn sour if not implemented correctly.

 

Upsides:

Lightning-fast transactions

 

No physical contact required

 

Works with most smartphones

 

Seemless integration with loyalty and coupon systems

 

Drawbacks:

More vulnerable to physical theft due o short range

 

s few older terminals, which aren't enforced by proper firmware protections OiltechandBrazil's Post-It Portal This reduces the risk when these fully actionable assets are sufficiently exposed (a trick never as reliable with gas-fired super-high-altitude areas).

 

Mobile Devices Require Excessive Power from Batteries

 

Potential for spoofing if the crypto is weak

 

9. Common Questions (FAQ)

A: So, you mean even without an internet connection NFC can work?

For pre-authorized tokens or low-value payments This restriction rules out many forms of fraud detection.

 

Q: Can I deactivate NFC altogether?

Yes. This is a feature that most system settings of Android and iOS for some handsets allow you to have.

 

Q: Which mobile wallets are safe?

Not at all. Wallets vary in their level security, some sacrifice advanced encryption for speed while others offer the bank-level encryption.

 

Q: What's better—QR or NFC?

Slower and easier to be faked because its cheaper, but will work on all cameras in the world. NFC is faster and more hygienic, but requires other hardware.

 

10. Strategic Insights for Professional Play in 2025

Layer defenses with a hardware to app and cloud approach.

 

Don’t just authenticate once. Contemplate revalidating for at-risk practices

 

Mandate security certificates for NFC payment system across industries

 

Motivate wallet providers to work together with telcos for data security within the network layer.

 

11. Solutions Worth Exploring

Things like blockchain-stamped schemas for transaction verification.

 

Behavioral profiling powered by AI for misuse detection

 

For example, token wallets that could work offline in network-limited environments.

 

First line of defense — User education campaigns

12. Practical Takeaways You Canno Overlook

Get a digital wallet for people who use NFC on the daily, and get something that has fraud insurance also.

 

Opt for chipsets with built-in secure elements (SE)

 

Monitor your transactions daily and report any suspicious charges promptly.

 

Test Different Wallets with response time of Fraud Simulation

 

13. Conclusion: So, Now What?

NFC (near-field communication) micropayments are a quick, easy and downright sexy proposition. However, 2025 will bring a larger user base and even bigger threats; the system must adapt — or face growing service failure due to compromise. As a community, we must be vigilant and take preventative measures to help guarantee the ease does not outweigh trust in both usage and development.

I hope its okay, i'm normally just lurking / commenting on reddit.

\--- Original text ---

Hey, don't know if this is the right place, just want to get this out of my system. I (30/M) feel lost for a while now, both in my private and professional life.

I don't know how to start so i'll just type as it comes out. Starting with my professional life because \*i think\* thats where all of this originates from. And i'm not trying to flex but hope that it will help with perspective.

I work in IT, 100% remote with great benefits and pretty good pay for where i live. I can't consider myself rich but i also don't have to check prices in day-to-day life. This career choice started when i was young. It started with video games but not in a ""i want to make video games"" kind of way but in a ""i want to know how it works"" kind of way. As far as i remember, i always was a curious child and am today. I like exploring and learning new stuff.

The problem now is that my work, while sounding like a ""dream"" to most people i explain it to, doesn't fullfil me. Its mostly because i don't have much to do, which in turn makes me fear to get booted because i think i don't contribute enough. Now i was never told this. Its just my mind going crazy on the fear of losing my job. I also have a hard time communicating with others / my teamlead about this due to said fear. I also fear that if i get a new project / task, it will be to hard for me because my self-esteem is pretty low and fail that way.

Now switching over to my private life, its a similar thing. Again not to flex but to have some perspective. I am happily married, we have a house, i drive one of my ""dream cars"" (medium car guy) and a lot more ""toys"" which accumulated over the years. I was diagnosed with depression last year but struggled longer than this. Last december was especially hard with me basically doing nothing other than binge watching youtube and sleep (had vacation for most of december). Since the start of this year, i basically turned around my life. Fixed my sleep schedule, wife and i go to the gym 2-3 times a week (last real physical activity was in 2019), reduced screen time, started to read books recently (have maybe read like 2 books until my 30th birthday, now having read 2.5 books in this month), stopped smoking cigarettes (still vape but health got better already), stopped drinking alcohol, reduced amount of coffee / caffeine intake.

The problem is that nothing really feels good anymore. Nothing seems to make me happy anymore and i've yet to find my passion. One of the examples which is pretty important to me is riding my motorcycle. When i started, it was like therapy. I could get out and clear my head. I barely rode this year and the few times i did, it didn't feel great. I still want to and like the idea of riding but when i do, i either feel numb or get angry if something ""isn't perfect"" which ruins the whole ride (plus anger and motorcycles don't go well together). I also hurt myself in the gym on friday and have back pain now. This means i have to reduce gym time and the motorcycle will have to wait too (will still go to the gym, just have to see what excercises i can do without making it worse).

I don't even know how to explain it really, because everytime i think about it, i feel bad for ""crying about non-issues"". I constantly start new stuff, buy new toys but can't keep at anything (motorcycle and PC being the notable exception here). Just yesterday i got hyped about getting into mountainbiking or RC cars, both of which means spending money. But i know it wont last so i just shove it away to not waste money on impulsive behaviour. I also had this all my life with different hobbies. Too many to list them here.

I am having a lot of mental health issues and while it's a good thing i am aware of it, its also bad because i'm constantly thinking about all of this stuff. Don't get me wrong, i want to work on solving those issues but it feels like a losing battle. I'm also trying to get help. Was in contact with my doctor and a psychiatrist last year. Few weeks ago i reached out to a psychotherapist because i had another breakdown, which mostly shows as bad tantrums. No physical violence but i screamed at my wife because of nonsense, which in turn makes me feel bad even more. I have another appointment next week. I got a preliminary diagnosis of BPD, which from looking at the symptoms would explain a lot of stuff. I feel like this takes ages but i am also aware that there are more people with more severe issues out there which also makes me feel bad ""for taking up space from people who really need help"".

Another issue is that i don't have anyone to talk. Sure i got my wife but she struggles herself because she is burned out from her work (working in IT as well, just another company), which is why i don't want to ""bombard"" her with my problems constantly. She is aware of it and very understanding luckily. And other than my wife, i don't have anything resembling a social circle. No friends really and especially no contacts i think i can talk to about all of this.

I'm a Gandhinagar local, staying near the Adalaj-Amba Township side. Born in Ahmedabad, raised in Gandhinagar – both places have always felt like home to me. There's something really soothing about the vibe here, and honestly, the way this whole belt has developed over the years is amazing to see. 
On a more fun note – I'm always on the hunt for good cafes in Gandhinagar (besides Starbucks, of course). So far, I've tried Mocha, Roast & Toast, Cafezza, Rubiceae Coffee Brewers, and Camillo. Out of these, Roast & Toast and Rubiceae have been my favorites – love their coffee, food variety, and overall vibe. If you have any other café recommendations in the city, I'm all ears. Always down for a good café convo.
 Also, I'm a doctor by profession – happy to chat about anything medical or help out med students with their studies too. Feel free to reach out! Looking forward to more discussions and discoveries here.✨",2,1748952800.0,Tri_city,0,1.0,False

I've been using the one flip-style moka pot coffee dispenser for over a decade and it's been showing it's age recently. Had a go at recreating it and adding some features I've always wished it had along the way.

  
It basically acts as a one-way valve (half-sphere covering a hole) for coffee grounds and lets you fill up the filter basket quickly and without spilling coffee everywhere. It also acts as a handheld funnel without the jar for when you have smaller portions of coffee. My improvements include having it more compact than the original, screws onto the generic metal coffee jars and some internal geometry to prevent dead-spaces that collect grounds.

Chapter 1  
  
""Grace, mom and dad have been searching for you for 7,236 days, and we've finally found you!""  
  
In Evergreen Cemetery, a well-dressed, elegant woman clung to my hand, crying her heart out.  
  
""All these years you've been lost, your father and I have been searching for you around the world. Each day was a painful wait. Now that we've finally found you, and since your adoptive parents' affairs have been settled, would you be willing to come to S City and live with us?""  
  
Hearing the hopeful tone in my mother's voice, I glanced at the tombstone engraved with the kind smiles of my adoptive parents, my eyes red, unable to make a decision.  
  
""I'll think about it.""  
  
For now, I still wasn't ready to adapt to the identity of a billionaire's daughter after living as an ordinary girl for so long.  
  
""No problem. We'll wait for your answer.""  
  
After parting ways with my mother, I returned to my apartment at Seasides.  
  
I opened the door to find the yellow roses in the vase on the entryway cabinet withered and a thick layer of dust coating the table.  
  
Even the clothes on the sofa remained exactly as they were before I left.  
  
I had been away for seven days attending a funeral, and Edgar Fallen had been unreachable for seven days.  
  
I took a deep breath and scrolled through our contact log on my phone.  
  
Thirteen calls, twenty-one WhatsApp voice calls, all with the same response: ""No answer.""  
  
Out of habit, I opened Instagram and saw Edgar's junior colleague, Nancy Mellis, had just posted an update:  
  
""Watching the sea with the person I love, and he's gentler than the ocean today.""  
  
The picture showed her and Edgar camping by the sea, watching the sunset.  
  
Staring at the image, my swollen eyes felt like something shattered within them.  
  
I recalled my mother asking if I wanted to settle in S City, and I had actually considered it for Edgar's sake. But now, it just seemed laughable.  
  
Grace Salen, your love life is truly a failure!  
  
'Da!'  
  
The door lock clicked.  
  
Edgar returned in casual attire. Seeing me sitting dazed on the sofa, he quickly asked, ""Grace, why are your eyes so red?""  
  
I looked at him, his clear gaze reflecting my sorrowful expression.  
  
""I just got something in my eye,"" I replied hoarsely, then asked, ""Where have you been these past few days?""  
  
His expression faltered slightly at my question.  
  
""The company has a very important business negotiation these days, and I'm very busy. It just ended today.""  
  
He watched my face, his tone concerned. ""I was so busy that I didn't have time to reply to you, so it was only on my way back that I saw all the calls from you. Was something urgent?""  
  
My tightly clenched fingers pressed hard into my palm as I held back my emotions.  
  
""Nothing urgent—I accidentally dialed a few times, that's all.""  
  
I walked over to the entryway, pulling out the wilted yellow roses and tossing them in the trash.  
  
I had given Edgar the chance to tell the truth, but he chose to lie instead.  
  
So, without revealing his poor excuse, I quietly went to my room to rest.  
  
Edgar seemed unsettled, quickly following me. ""You look pale. Is it your period of this month?""  
  
I paused.  
  
He used to know my period date was at the end of the month, and always preparing hot milk and heating pads to soothe my cramps.  
  
But now, it was only the middle of the month.  
  
Watching his concerned face, I felt a coldness spreading through me.  
  
""No, I just didn't sleep well yesterday.""  
  
Unconcerned, Edgar took his pajamas and went to shower. ""Then get some rest early tonight.""  
  
The sound of running water echoed from the bathroom as a dampness crept into my heart.  
  
A notification sounded from my bedside table.  
  
I glanced over to see a message from ""Sailor Moon"" with the flashing profile picture of a crescent moon.  
  
""Edgar, the ocean romance has been received. Don't forget you promised to take me hiking to watch the sunrise next week!""  
  
One glance at that message sent a dull ache through my heart.  
  
He saved Nancy's contact as ""Sailor Moon."" They watched the sunset by the ocean, and now they're planning to watch the sunrise in the mountains—how romantic!  
  
Clenching my fists, I forced myself to remain calm.  
  
With a quick glance at the closed bathroom door, I walked into the living room and dialed my mother's number.  
  
""Mom, I'll come to S City with you after I finish handling the matters here at the end of the month.""  
  
""Wonderful! I'll start preparing your visa right away."" My mother sounded delighted but paused before cautiously asking, ""But if you go to S City, you and Edgar will have a long-distance relationship. Will he be okay with that?""  
  
Thinking of Edgar, a surge of pain briefly flashed through my heart before settling into quiet resolve.  
  
""I'm planning to divorce him.I won't ever see him again.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
My mother seemed to sense the slight catch in my voice and gently comforted me.  
  
""You've been with him for three years, yet when your adoptive parents both passed away in that car accident, he didn't even go to accompany and care for you. You're better off without a man like that. There are plenty of eligible bachelors in S City. When the time comes, your father and I can help you find someone—you'll have your pick.""  
  
""Alright, I'll pack up over the next couple of weeks. I'll meet you at the airport.""  
  
Just as I ended the call, the bathroom door opened, and Edgar emerged with a towel wrapped around his waist.  
  
""Who are you meeting at the airport?"" he asked.  
  
I paused, looking down slightly. ""My mother.""  
  
As he put on his pajamas, Edgar said, ""If your mom's coming to Seattle, I'll set up a dinner to welcome her.""  
  
He assumed I meant my adoptive mother, and for a moment, I didn't feel the need to clarify everything.  
  
""Talk about it later,"" I replied vaguely.  
  
Edgar murmured a half-hearted ""hmm"" and returned his gaze to his phone, his face relaxed, occasionally breaking into a soft smile. I looked away, lying down with my eyes closed.  
  
After some time, I heard him set down his phone and felt him slide closer, wrapping his arm around me.  
  
My body stiffened, and I instinctively pulled his hand away.  
  
""Babe, are you mad because I didn't answer your calls? I'll make sure to keep my phone on me from now on so I won't go off the grid again."" Edgar seemed to sense something was off, trying to coax me gently.  
  
""No, I'm not mad. I'm just really tired.""  
  
I kept my tone flat, unwilling to say more.  
  
But inside, I silently told him:  
  
Edgar, there is no ""next time"" for us.  
  
The night was quiet, and his gentle breathing filled the room, but I couldn't sleep. Thoughts of the ""Sailor Moon"" in his phone haunted me, and I made up my mind.  
  
I got up, picked up his phone, unlocked it, and opened WhatsApp.  
  
Originally, I was the only pinned contact, but now it was both me and ""Sailor Moon,"" with her chat sitting at the top. Their latest messages were goodnight texts right before he slept.  
  
My hands trembled as I scrolled through Edgar and Nancy's chat history, realizing they'd been messaging daily for an entire year.  
  
He'd spent Valentine's Day with me, yet he'd still sent her pictures of the food we shared.  
  
He'd watched movies with me, only to text her later about whether it was worth seeing, even taking her for a second viewing the next day.  
  
Even after our late nights together, he would share folk music with her as if he were a pure-hearted young man.  
  
Each page of their chat clashed with my memories of our relationship, tearing me apart inside. I didn't understand it.  
  
The man who looked at me with such genuine love—how could he share those intimate details with someone else while claiming to love me?  
  
I stayed up all night.  
  
The next morning, as I finished preparing breakfast, I checked the reminder on my phone.  
  
Today marked three years with Edgar.  
  
Six months ago, we had planned a trip to Disneyland to celebrate.  
  
With three teen days left until I left, I decided to end things there, bringing closure to our three years together.  
  
At the dining table, Edgar was scrolling on his phone as he ate. I couldn't hold back. ""Couldn't that wait until after breakfast? You have a flight to catch, remember?""  
  
He absentmindedly replied, ""Flight? Are you going somewhere today?""  
  
For a moment, I froze, realizing he'd forgotten our Disneyland plans and the significance of today.  
  
I had intended to part on good terms, but now I just felt foolish.  
  
Forcing a smile, I said, ""It's nothing. I'm just seeing off a friend.""  
  
Edgar didn't ask further.  
  
At that moment, his phone screen lit up. I glanced over instinctively and saw a message from ""Sailor Moon"":  
  
""I'm so hungry! Where's my breakfast?""  
  
Edgar quickly grabbed his phone, taking two egg crepes from the table and glancing at me with a guilty look.  
  
""The company has some urgent matters and needs me to come over.""  
  
Watching him leave in a hurry, I let out a silent laugh.  
  
He could barely even lie convincingly. He really couldn't wait.  
  
I picked up my phone and canceled the Disneyland tickets I had booked months ago.  
  
On Instagram, I opened Nancy's new post:  
  
""I said I was hungry, and my boyfriend showed up downstairs with a homemade breakfast right away!""  
  
I felt a chill wash over me.  
  
Homemade by him?  
  
How absurd!  
  
I couldn't eat anymore.  
  
I got up and threw the remaining breakfast into the trash, along with the last traces of affection I had for Edgar.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I never doubted love, but love can change in an instant.  
  
Especially after three years.  
  
This relationship had already soured—I should have realized it sooner.  
  
But love makes you blind.  
  
I pulled out a large cardboard box and opened the storage cabinet that filled an entire wall.  
  
Inside, there were remnants of our love—Kuromi plaster figurines we painted on rainy days, handmade pottery projects, bracelets, and phone cases.  
  
The wall was covered in photos, a visible timeline of our three years together.  
  
From our early days of warm embraces to later photos where we only posed with half-hearted peace signs.  
  
I didn't even know when Edgar's heart had started to change.  
  
I took a deep breath, wiping the redness from the corners of my eyes, then tossed everything from the cabinet, piece by piece, into the box.  
  
I tore down every photo from the wall as well.  
  
The yellowed adhesive left stark marks on the white wall, mirroring my scarred, fractured heart.  
  
As I packed, memories surfaced, and daylight slowly faded.  
  
Once the box was filled, I took it downstairs to the dumpster, then lay on the sofa, exhausted.  
  
After some time, the door opened.  
  
Edgar walked in, turning on the lights in the living room.  
  
Seeing me curled up on the sofa, he hurried over.  
  
""Grace, why are you sleeping here? You'll catch a cold!""  
  
His concern seemed genuine, with no trace of pretense.  
  
I stared at him for three seconds before looking away.  
  
""I was cleaning the house and fell asleep accidentally.""  
  
Edgar glanced around the room, noticing the changes.  
  
""Did you throw away a lot of stuff? It feels emptier.""  
  
I casually said, ""There are too many things at home, so I tidied up a bit.""  
  
Edgar nodded, not giving it much thought.  
  
Watching his casual demeanor, I felt a slight ache in my chest.  
  
If he'd looked a bit more closely, he'd have noticed that everything missing was part of our couple's collection or love mementos—things I'd never discard without a reason.  
  
But he was too busy texting to notice anything.  
  
After all, Nancy filled his thoughts now.  
  
A notification pinged on his phone.  
  
Edgar glanced down, and his expression shifted.  
  
""Grace, today's our anniversary! Why didn't you remind me? Did you forget too?""  
  
Only then did I realize that his phone's calendar had reminded him of today's date.  
  
Hearing his reproach, I felt a dull weight settle inside me.  
  
""You seemed too busy, so I didn't mention it.""  
  
I had reminded him this morning, but someone preoccupied wouldn't have registered it.  
  
Sensing my indifference, Edgar looked a bit uneasy.  
  
""Babe, that was my fault. Let's make it up another day, like we used to, with all the ceremony and excitement.""  
  
He gently held my hand, trying to appease me with a soft tone.  
  
Just then, his phone rang again.  
  
It was a voice call from ""Sailor Moon.""  
  
He instinctively declined the call, but Nancy dialed right back.  
  
Seeing his guilty expression, I gave him an excuse to leave.  
  
""Go ahead and take it; it could be urgent from the company.""  
  
After all, the lab had always been his go-to excuse whenever he had to step out unexpectedly.  
  
After all, the company issue is always his best shield.  
  
This time, I said it myself to save him the trouble of lying again.  
  
Edgar hesitated, then quickly went to the balcony to answer the call.  
  
When he returned, he gave me a light hug and said, ""You really get me. There's a problem at work I need to handle.""  
  
""When things settle down, I'll take you out for a proper anniversary celebration. We'll stay in the Disney castle, and I'll make you feel like a princess.""  
  
I turned slightly away from his embrace, lowered my gaze, and nodded.  
  
""Okay.""  
  
It was a simple response, devoid of any expectation.  
  
I had long since stopped believing in his promises.  
  
But when I saw a red notification on Instagram, I instinctively opened it.  
  
Nancy had posted a new update—  
  
The picture showed Edgar sipping coffee in his office.  
  
""Sharing the same cup of coffee with my boyfriend, more intimate than a kiss.""

At first, I figured it would be impossible to replace most of the everyday stuff I use. You hear a lot about how everything is imported these days, and I kind of assumed I’d get stuck after swapping out a couple of items.

But I was curious, so I started small. And, honestly… it’s been surprising. Here’s what I’ve switched over so far:

\-> My desk chair? Picked it up from Boutique Made in Canada in Quebec. Not fancy, but sturdy, and it feels good supporting a small business.  
\-> Notebooks from Canadian National Notebook (Ontario) - I actually prefer them now over the cheap imports I used to grab.  
\-> Pens from Karst (Toronto) - sleek, minimal, and they don’t dry out after a week.  
\-> Coffee from Pilot Coffee Roasters (Toronto) and Just Us! Coffee (Nova Scotia). I won’t lie, it’s pricier than grocery store beans, but man, it tastes better.  
\-> Cleaning stuff from The Unscented Company (Montreal). Didn’t think I’d care, but now I’m into the simple vibe - no weird smells, just clean.  
\-> Towels and bedding from Maison Tess. (Montreal). Not cheap, but probably the nicest sheets I’ve ever owned.  
\-> Snacks? Hardbite Chips (BC) have become a problem in my house. Add in some Nuts To You (Ontario) and Maple Leaf Snacks (New Brunswick), and yeah, my pantry is looking very Canadian these days.  
\-> Basics like socks from Kotn (Toronto) - they just feel more solid than the fast-fashion stuff I used to grab.  
\-> Cookware? Paderno (PEI). Classic for a reason.

I’m not saying it’s been perfect - there’s still a lot of stuff I can’t find made in Canada, and yeah, some things cost more. But I’m at about 70% Canadian-made in my day-to-day life now, which is way more than I thought I’d get to when I started this.

If anyone else is doing something similar, I’d love to hear what brands you’ve found. ",13,1748952477.0,BuyCanadian,2,0.93,False

This is a weird feeling it’s almost like FOMO but from what.. maybe I just need to make the most of out seeing people in school again even if it’s before the exam and going to get a coffee with someone I’d consider more of a ‘school friend’ than an outside one and create some last minute friendships with girls in my year. 

I’ve had a lot of ‘we should definitely go out after lc’ moments with people so I should probably follow up on them. Summer come fast🫩🥀

Day 1: Took 1 Bupropion & 1/2 Naltrexone (+Top +B12) with the larger portion of my breakfast (I have 2 breakfasts-1 small Greek yogurt pre-workout and Kodiak cakes with fruit and maybe another Greek yogurt or an egg post workout).  No side effects at all. I barely ate lunch and had a smoothie for dinner (dinner is normal for me since I work a night shift 2 nights a week). I also had 2 phone interviews so it could have been nerves that made me less hungry. lol. Slept like normal. I did wake up once to pee (I drank a lot of water!!!!) and had trouble going back to sleep but I had an in person interview the next day so again, probably nerves. 
Day 2: Took 1 Bupropion with my bigger breakfast. I had zero side effects. I can see where people might have issues with constipation. I eat over 30g of fiber and drink a ton of water and it has been more difficult than usual. I ate like normal (in a defect) and didn’t notice if I was hungry or not. The food noise has been reduced but it’s still there. 
Day 3: Took 1 Bupropion & 1/2 Naltrexone (+Top +B12) with my breakfast. I woke up not hungry at all. I went to the gym and felt fine. I took a protein shake just in case I got hungry but I didn’t. I started to feel hungry on my drive home so that was nice. I haven’t given up my morning coffee either. 
Day 4-7 i have been drinking my coffee like normal with no side effects. I have taken the meds as prescribed with no side effects, other than really thirsty when I take the 1/2 naltrexone, which is nice. I do feel full faster. I do think about food a lot less.  I track my calories and go to the gym 5 days a week.

Fill with 12 oz of water. Machine intakes the full amount while making some noise. It heats up in a minute or two. Coffee comes out.

This new one, I did the initial brew cleaning with just water. Then coffee. But the behavior is different. It starts to spit out hot water for a second then coffee in mere seconds while it's still taking in the water from the tank.

I tasted the coffee and it seems like it normally would taste. The model and everything in terms of instructions seemed like it's just from 2023. No idea if this is an upgraded version or if I should get something else?

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

Each taps into themes of identity, hidden power, betrayal, and rise to glory, with a subtle nudge that you might have access to the story:"," Broken Promises Rachael rushed home, barely able to contain her excitement. The bright lines on the pregnancy test still seemed surreal. After years of trying, endless doctor visits, and nights spent crying in Victor’s arms, it was finally happening. She couldn’t wait to see his face when she told him. Today was the start of their happily ever after.She pulled into the driveway, her mind buzzing with a thousand thoughts of their future. Their baby. She clutched her purse tightly, the test still inside, and hurried into the house.But as soon as she stepped through the door, something felt wrong. The living room was in disarray—cushions tossed about, a wine glass half-empty on the coffee table, and clothes scattered like someone had rushed out of them.Rachael’s heart skipped a beat as she spotted the unfamiliar lingerie draped over the couch. She touched the lacy fabric, her fingers trembling. Panic set in. She blinked rapidly, trying to force a logical explanation into her mind. Maybe Victor’s sister was here, or—no, that didn’t make sense. Deep down, she knew.She dropped the lingerie, her breathing shallow and quick, and followed the trail of discarded clothes down the hall. The closer she got to the bedroom, the louder the muffled sounds became—moans and gasps, unmistakable and raw. Rachael’s vision blurred, her legs heavy like lead. She grabbed the doorframe, steadying herself. Every instinct screamed at her to turn back, to not look, but she pushed the door open.There, tangled in sheets and each other, were Victor and Evelyn. The sight hit Rachael like a punch to the gut, knocking the breath out of her. Her husband and her sister. The betrayal was overwhelming, a tidal wave crashing down, pulling her under.The pregnancy test slipped from her grasp, hitting the floor with a soft thud that went unnoticed. “What the hell is this?” Rachael’s voice cracked, half shriek, half sob. She felt as though she’d stepped into a nightmare she couldn’t wake up from. “Victor, Evelyn, what is this?”Victor scrambled off the bed, fumbling to cover himself. “Rachael, this isn’t—”But Evelyn didn’t even flinch. Instead, she smiled with a cold satisfaction that sent chills down Rachael’s spine. “Don’t look so shocked, Rachael,” she drawled. “Did you really think you deserved him? Pathetic.”Rachael’s vision blurred with tears. She turned to Victor, searching for any sign of regret, a hint that this was some terrible mistake. “Victor, after everything we’ve been through, after all we’ve done to build this life... How could you?” Her voice wavered, each word dripping with the pain of betrayal.Victor pulled on his shirt, avoiding her gaze, his face twisted in a mixture of guilt and frustration. “It’s not what you think, Rachael,” he started, but the weak excuse hung in the air like a bad joke.“Not what I think?” Rachael repeated, her voice rising in pitch as anger began to replace her shock. “You’re in bed with my sister! How many times has this happened? How long have you been lying to me?”Evelyn rolled her eyes, sitting up with deliberate slowness, as if savoring the moment. “Victor and I have been together for months. He’s tired of you, Rachael. Tired of your whining, your failures, your pathetic attempts to keep him interested.” She glanced at the pregnancy test lying on the floor, her lip curling. “And I’m guessing that didn’t go the way you hoped either.”Rachael’s heart clenched, her hand instinctively covering her abdomen as if trying to protect the fragile hope inside her. “You don’t know anything about me,” she spat, tears threatening to spill. “You’re nothing but a snake. Both of you.”Victor stepped forward, reaching for her, but Rachael jerked back, holding up a hand to keep him at a distance. “Don’t touch me,” she hissed. “I can’t believe I ever loved you. Either of you.”Evelyn’s mocking laughter filled the room, echoing in Rachael’s ears. “You’re so dramatic, Rachael. Victor doesn’t need your love. He needs someone who can give him what he wants. And that’s never been you.”Rachael’s fingers clenched into fists, the sting of Evelyn’s words hitting deeper than she wanted to admit. She turned to Victor one last time, her voice low and trembling. “I gave you everything, Victor. My heart, my trust, my years. And you threw it all away for... this?”Victor’s silence spoke louder than any excuse he could muster. His eyes darted away, shame flickering briefly before settling into a cold, detached expression. “Maybe it’s best if you just leave,” he said finally, his voice devoid of emotion. “Evelyn and I... we’re together now. And you... you deserve better than this.”Rachael stared at him, the weight of his words crushing her. There it was—the final nail in the coffin of her marriage, driven in by the man she had once thought she’d spend her life with. She backed away, her legs shaking, but she held her head high, refusing to let either of them see her break.“I hope you both rot,” she said quietly, her voice steady despite the tears burning her eyes. She turned and walked out, leaving the shattered remains of her dreams behind.Rachael slammed the door shut and started the car, her hands shaking as she gripped the steering wheel. She had no destination in mind; she just needed to get away.Away from the house that now felt like a graveyard of broken promises, away from the suffocating betrayal that threatened to choke her. The city blurred around her, the streetlights flickering past as she drove with no sense of direction, fueled only by anger and heartbreak.Her phone buzzed on the passenger seat, Victor’s name lighting up the screen. Rachael hesitated for a moment, the bile rising in her throat. She didn’t want to hear his voice, but curiosity—and fury—got the better of her. She snatched the phone and answered, her tone laced with venom. “What do you want!”Victor’s voice came through, cold and devoid of any remorse. “Rachael, I’ve instructed my lawyer to send over the divorce papers. Sign them. It’s over.”The casual finality of his words sent a fresh wave of rage through her. “You think you can just send me a piece of paper and that’s it? We’re done? After everything you put me through? You’re a pathetic, spineless coward, Victor.”Victor sighed, sounding more annoyed than guilty. “Rachael, let’s not make this harder than it needs to be. Evelyn and I are moving forward, and you should too.”“Moving forward?” Rachael’s voice rose, her anger spilling over. “You mean crawling into bed with my sister like the shameless, gutless bastard you are? You have no idea what loyalty or love means. You disgust me, Victor. You’re not a man—you’re a joke. A pathetic excuse of a husband who can’t even keep his pants zipped.”Victor’s tone hardened, defensive, “At least she fucks me and satisfies me better than you, bitch!” Victor yelled, his words slicing through the phone like a jagged knife. Rachael gasped, the wind knocked out of her as if she’d been punched. She clutched her chest, the pain spreading like wildfire—rage, disbelief, and heartbreak all mingling together.For a moment, she was stunned into silence, the venom in his voice lingering in her ears. But then the shock faded, replaced by a burning fury that surged through her veins. She wasn’t going to let him have the last word. Not like this.“Take that back, you good-for-nothing excuse of a man!” Rachael’s voice quivered, her anger bubbling over. “You think that pathetic insult means anything coming from you? You’re nothing, Victor! A spineless, worthless coward who can’t handle a real woman, so you settle for scraps. I gave you everything, and you threw it away for someone who’s just as cheap and hollow as you are!”Victor’s silence only fueled her fire. “You think Evelyn’s some prize? She’s a two-faced, backstabbing bitch, and you’re too blind to see you’re just her latest game. She’ll chew you up and spit you out when she’s done, just like she’s done with every other idiot who’s fallen for her act. You’re not special, Victor—you’re a fool. A damn fool who doesn’t even realize he’s lost the best thing he ever had.”Victor scoffed, but Rachael cut him off before he could speak. “You know what? I pity you. I pity you for thinking that sneaking around and betraying the one person who actually gave a damn about you makes you some kind of man. But you’re not a man.“ You’re a pathetic, insecure little boy who can’t stand the sight of himself in the mirror. And one day, when Evelyn’s done using you, when you’re alone and drowning in your own self-loathing, you’ll remember this moment. You’ll remember that you lost me because you were too stupid to see what you had.”She paused, breathing heavily, her chest heaving with every word. “So enjoy your trash, Victor. Enjoy every miserable second of the life you’ve chosen because you and Evelyn are a perfect match—two worthless, miserable souls destined to destroy each other. And when you come crawling back, begging for forgiveness, remember this: you are nothing to me. Nothing. And you never will be again.”With that, she ended the call, throwing the phone onto the seat beside her. Rachael’s hands were still shaking, but she felt lighter, freer. Victor’s words had stung, but her own felt like a release, a purging of all the anger and hurt she’d carried for so long.She wasn’t going to let Victor’s insults define her. She was going to rise above this, stronger than ever. And Victor? He could wallow in the mess he’d made of his life.Because Rachael was done with him. For good.Chapter 2 Breaking PointRacheal sank into her couch, her hands mindlessly reaching for the array of junk food scattered on the coffee table. Tears streamed down her cheeks, mixing with the saltiness of the chips she stuffed into her mouth.It had been a month since everything fell apart, and though she put on a brave face for the world, the cracks were deep, and her pain felt endless.Each day blurred into the next, filled with crying, overeating, and self-loathing. She had gained weight rapidly, her once healthy glow fading as she neglected herself, forgetting about the tiny heartbeat that depended on her.The sound of the front door opening snapped her out of her daze. Chloe, her best friend, walked in, her face brightening with a warm smile that quickly faded when she saw Racheal.There she was, slouched on the couch, her swollen eyes red from crying, her hair in disarray, and surrounded by empty wrappers. She looked like a broken shell of the vibrant woman Chloe once knew.""Racheal,"" Chloe said, her voice tinged with concern. ""You look like a sad potato left out in the sun too long."" She tried to make light of it, but her heart broke seeing her friend like this. ""Come on, babe. You can’t keep doing this to yourself.""Racheal sniffed, wiping her tears with the back of her hand. “I don’t know how to stop, Chloe. Everything just... hurts.”“It’s been a month, girl!” Chloe's voice rose, frustration edging her words as she tossed her bag onto the chair. “You’re still crying over that douchebag? He’s not worth it!”Racheal’s sobs intensified, her shoulders shaking with every breath. “I don’t know what to do anymore, Chloe!” she wailed, her voice cracking.“I have a child growing inside me, and there’s no father. It’s all too much.” She choked on her own words, tears mixing with snot as she messily wiped her face with the back of her hand. “I don’t know how to be strong for this baby when I feel so weak.”Chloe’s heart clenched at the sight of her best friend falling apart. She moved closer, gripping Racheal’s shoulders firmly, pulling her into a gentle embrace.“There, there, it’s okay, baby,” Chloe whispered, her voice soothing as she stroked Racheal’s hair, trying to comfort her through her own pain. She hated seeing Racheal like this—defeated, lost, and drowning in a sea of despair.But Racheal’s mind was still trapped, unable to accept the harsh reality of her situation. She hadn’t come to terms with Victor leaving, her thoughts clinging to the faint hope that maybe, just maybe, it was all a bad dream she’d eventually wake up from.She still half-expected to hear his keys jingling at the door, his voice filling the empty rooms. A delusional fantasy that she couldn’t shake, even though Victor had made his choice loud and clear—he was gone, and he wasn’t coming back.“You’re not alone in this,” Chloe murmured, holding Racheal tighter. “I know it feels like the end, but it’s not. We’re going to figure this out. You’re stronger than you think, and you don’t need him to be a great mom. We’ll get through this together.”After helping Racheal calm down, Chloe brushed her friend’s messy hair out of her face, trying to restore a sense of normalcy. “Come on,” Chloe said gently, standing up and offering her hand. “Let’s go to the kitchen. Help me whip up something good. It’ll take your mind off things.”Racheal hesitated but eventually took Chloe’s hand, letting her friend guide her to the kitchen. It was a small gesture, but Chloe knew that keeping Racheal busy, even for a few minutes, was better than letting her spiral deeper into her grief.Since the divorce, Chloe had been the only one taking care of her, practically moving in to ensure Racheal wasn’t completely alone with her thoughts. Chloe had become the sister Racheal always wished Evelyn could be, someone who actually cared.As they shuffled around the kitchen, Chloe’s eyes flicked to Racheal’s vacant stare. It was more than just heartbreak—there was a lifetime of hurt simmering beneath the surface. Racheal was an orphan, adopted by Evelyn’s parents when she was just a child. She had always tried to be good to but instead they treated her like trash.Chloe watched Racheal’s pained expression as she chopped the vegetables, her movements robotic and disconnected.It broke Chloe’s heart to see her best friend so lost, and she wished she could take the pain away, even if just for a moment. Chloe continued stirring the pot, her mind racing with ways to help Racheal rebuild, to remind her of the strong, resilient woman she used to be.“You know,” Chloe began, trying to keep her tone light, “we should do something fun, just us girls. A weekend getaway or even just a spa day. You need a break, Racheal. A real one.”Racheal gave a half-hearted smile, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “I don’t know, Chloe. I feel so... heavy. I can’t pretend to be okay when I’m not. Everywhere I turn, it’s like there’s a ghost of what I lost.”Chloe set the spoon down, wiping her hands on a dish towel as she walked over to Racheal. She took the knife from her friend’s trembling hands and pulled her into a tight hug. “You don’t have to be okay right now. But you have to keep moving, for yourself and for your baby. You are not defined by the people who hurt you.”Racheal leaned into the embrace, her eyes stinging with fresh tears. Chloe’s warmth was the only thing holding her together. “I just... I don’t know how to be anything other than this mess, Chloe. I thought I had everything figured out. I thought Victor and I would be together forever. But Evelyn—” Her voice wavered, anger mingling with the hurt. “She took everything from me. And now I’m just... empty.”Chloe pulled back slightly, cupping Racheal’s face in her hands. “Evelyn didn’t take everything. You still have yourself, and you still have me. You have your baby. And that’s a start.”Racheal was about to say something, her lips parting to speak, when the television suddenly blared with breaking news. Both women’s heads turned to the screen, where a flashy headline in bold, all-capital letters demanded their attention:“BILLIONAIRE VICTOR SEEN WITH EVELYN BLACKWOOD, SPORTING A BABY BUMP WHILE SHOPPING FOR BABY CLOTHES. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? IS VICTOR THE FATHER OF EVELYN’S BABY? AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS OTHER WIFE? STAY TUNED.”The words hit Racheal like a punch to the gut. She froze, her breath hitching as images of Victor and Evelyn filled the screen. There they were, smiling and looking every bit the happy couple as they strolled through the baby store, Evelyn’s swollen belly unmistakable. Victor’s hand rested protectively on her back, his face lit up with the same joy Racheal had once seen when he looked at her.Racheal’s vision blurred as tears welled up, the room spinning around her. It felt like she was watching her worst nightmare unfold in real time. The man who had vowed to love her, who she had once believed was her forever, was now flaunting his new life with the very person who had ripped her world apart.Chloe quickly grabbed the remote, fumbling to mute the TV, but it was too late. The damage was done. Racheal staggered back, her legs weak beneath her, and she clutched the counter for support. “No...” she whispered, her voice breaking as the tears she’d been holding back spilled over. “No, no, no. This can’t be happeningRacheal’s knees buckled, and she collapsed onto the kitchen floor, her hands clutching her chest as though she could physically hold her heart together. “I can't believe this! What! What the fuck!,” she repeated louder.She rocked back and forth, the disbelief twisting her insides. Each image of Victor and Evelyn together was like salt on an open wound, raw and unrelenting.Chloe dropped to her knees beside her, her heart breaking for her friend. “Racheal, listen to me,” she pleaded, holding Racheal’s trembling hands. “You have to breathe. Don’t let them destroy you. They aren’t worth this.”But Racheal couldn’t hear her. The weight of the betrayal was crushing her, pulling her under. Every dream she’d ever had—the white picket fence, the family, the life she’d built in her mind—was gone. All she could see was Evelyn, glowing and happy, living the life that should have been hers.“How could he do this to me?” Racheal sobbed, her tears flowing freely. “I gave him everything, Chloe. I was his wife. I loved him. And now… now he’s having a baby with her.” Her voice broke, and she buried her face in her hands, her shoulders shaking with the force of her grief.Chloe wrapped her arms around Racheal, her own eyes stinging with tears she refused to shed. “You are so much more than this moment,” she whispered fiercely. “I know it doesn’t feel like it now, but you will get through this. Victor is nothing but a liar, and Evelyn… she’s not worth your tears.”Racheal pulled away, wiping her face with the back of her hand, but the tears wouldn’t stop. “Why wasn’t I enough? Why did he choose her?” The questions spilled out, the doubts and fears she had buried since the divorce now laid bare. It wasn’t just anger; it was the deep, soul-crushing pain of not feeling worthy, of being discarded like she was nothing.Chloe shook her head, her grip tightening on Racheal’s arms. “This isn’t about you, Racheal. This is about them. They’re broken, selfish people, and they don’t deserve you. You are enough, more than enough, and one day, you’ll see that.”Racheal nodded, trying to muster the strength Chloe saw in her, but every breath felt like dragging her lungs through broken glass. Her vision blurred as the weight of everything pressed down on her chest, tighter and tighter. The room felt smaller, the air thinner, and she couldn’t shake the feeling of being trapped, suffocated by her own pain.Chloe’s voice seemed distant, her words a muffled echo that barely reached Racheal’s ears. “One step at a time,” Chloe repeated, her face full of concern. “We’ll get through this together.”But Racheal couldn’t respond. Her head was spinning, the edges of her vision darkening. She tried to stand, to shake off the dizziness, but her legs wobbled beneath her. She reached out, gripping the edge of the counter for support, but her fingers slipped, weak and trembling.“Racheal?” Chloe’s voice broke through, sharp with alarm. She stepped closer, watching as Racheal’s face drained of color. “Hey, are you okay? Racheal!”Racheal’s world tilted, and before she could process what was happening, her knees buckled. She collapsed, her body crumpling to the floor in a lifeless heap. The last thing she heard was Chloe’s frantic scream, her name echoing through the house as everything went black.Chapter 3 Desperate MeasuresAs Racheal lay unconscious on the kitchen floor, Chloe’s panic transformed into urgent action. She grabbed her phone with trembling hands and dialed the number for a local doctor.“Dr. Harper? This is Chloe Wright. My friend, Racheal—she’s collapsed. Please, we need help right away!” Her voice was a desperate rush, her heart pounding as she awaited the response.Within minutes, the doorbell rang. Chloe hurried to answer, admitting Dr. Harper, a calm and experienced physician. He quickly assessed Racheal’s condition, checking her pulse and examining her vital signs with practiced efficiency.“Chloe, can you give me a moment alone with Racheal?” Dr. Harper asked, his voice steady and reassuring.Chloe nodded, stepping aside but remaining close enough to hear. The doctor’s face was set in a serious expression as he worked, occasionally glancing at his medical bag and then back at Racheal.After a thorough examination, Dr. Harper stood up, looking concerned. “Racheal’s vital signs are stable now, but she’s under a lot of stress. I need to speak with her husband about her condition and the stress she’s been under. It’s crucial for her well-being.”Chloe’s eyes widened. “Her husband? Victor is... he’s not around anymore. He left her.”Dr. Harper looked puzzled, then reconsidered. “I see. Well, I’ll need to speak with someone close to her—maybe a family member or someone who can provide more context about her situation. It’s important to address the stressors affecting her health.”As Chloe absorbed the doctor’s words, Racheal began to stir, her eyes fluttering open. She slowly became aware of her surroundings, her gaze focusing on Chloe and the unfamiliar face of Dr. Harper.“What... happened?” Racheal mumbled, her voice weak.“You collapsed, Racheal,” Chloe explained gently. “Dr. Harper is here to help.”Racheal’s confusion cleared as she saw the concern etched on Chloe’s face. “Victor,” she whispered. “Did he—”“No, Victor isn’t here,” Chloe said firmly. “But we’ll get you the help you need. Dr. Harper, do you think there’s a way to help her through this without...?”Dr. Harper nodded. “We’ll start with what we can do here and ensure she’s stable. If there’s anyone else who can provide support or insight into her situation, it would be helpful.”After Dr Harper finished his examination and gave Racheal a serious look. “There are several tests that need to be carried out, and they require a significant amount of money. When you’re ready, you can come to the office to get the tests started. Take care of yourself, Miss. Have a good day.”With that, Dr. Harper packed his medical bag and left. Chloe watched him go, her mind racing with concern for her friend.Racheal, still disoriented but determined, pushed herself up from the floor. She looked at Chloe with a mix of desperation and resolve. “This is the call to get Victor back. I need to go to the apartment and tell him what the doctor said. Maybe he’ll come back if he knows how serious this is.”Chloe stared at her, disbelief etched on her face. “Racheal, are you kidding me? Victor’s left you. He’s with Evelyn now. You can’t just waltz back into his life and expect him to magically return.”Chloe’s frustration erupted as she paced the kitchen, her voice sharp. “Racheal, are you out of your mind? You seriously think that going back to Victor is going to fix anything? He’s moved on, and you’re still here, wallowing in this pit of despair. Are you fuvking stupid! Get over it! ”Racheal looked up, her face pale and tear-streaked. “Chloe, I just— I need to try. The doctor said the father needs to be involved. I can’t just sit here and do nothing.”“Try?” Chloe snapped, her hands on her hips. “Try what? Getting your heart broken again? You’ve been through hell already, and now you want to walk back into the fire?”“I know it sounds crazy,” Racheal said, her voice trembling. “But if there’s even a chance that Victor could come back, I have to take it. I can’t just sit here and wait for things to get worse.”Chloe’s face reddened with frustration. “You’re not thinking clearly, Racheal! This isn’t just about you anymore. You have a baby to think about. Do you really want to put yourself through more pain and risk your health for someone who clearly doesn’t care?”“I’m not doing this for me,” Racheal said firmly. “I’m doing this for my baby. The doctor said the father needs to be involved for tests, and I need to make sure everything’s alright.”Chloe threw her hands up in exasperation. “For tests? Is that what you’re focusing on right now? The fact that you’re trying to drag Victor back into your life, only to be potentially hurt again, is insane! What if he rejects you outright? What if he refuses to help with the baby?”“I have to try!” Racheal insisted, her eyes pleading. “I can’t just let him get away with everything. I need him to know what’s at stake.”Chloe’s anger was palpable as she breathed harder, her voice rising. “You’re going to lose yourself trying to fight for someone who’s already made his choice. What happens when he turns you away? You’ll be right back where you started, only now you’ll be even more broken! Use your brains Racheal! Stop being a desperate bitch! There are lots of dicks out there! Forget about him, girl!”Racheal’s face was a mask of determination mixed with anguish. “I don’t know what else to do. I feel like if I don’t try, I’ll never be able to forgive myself. I need to know that I did everything I could for our child.”Chloe’s shoulders slumped, her anger giving way to deep concern. “Racheal, you’re not thinking clearly. You need help! You're thinking like a fucking lunatic!This isn’t just about getting Victor back. It’s about your well-being and your baby’s future. You’re a mess right now, and the last thing you need is to add more emotional turmoil.”“I can’t just give up,” Racheal said, her voice breaking. “I can’t let him think he can just walk away and not have any consequences.”Chloe took a deep breath, trying to calm her racing thoughts. “Okay, fine. If you’re set on doing this, at least promise me you’ll be careful. Don’t go in there with expectations that he’ll magically come back or that everything will be okay. You need to protect yourself. But I promise you if you come here crying and hurt I'll tell you I told you so.”Racheal nodded, tears spilling down her cheeks. “I will. I just need to know that I tried. I can’t move on without knowing that I did everything possible.”Chloe’s face softened, though her frustration lingered. “Alright. But you need to be prepared for the possibility that this could end badly. Don’t let your hope blind you to the reality of the situation.”Racheal swallowed hard, her gaze resolute. “I understand. I just… I need to do this. I can’t move forward without trying.”“Let me go get my bag upstairs and put on some makeup. I need to look really good for him,” Racheal said, her voice laced with a flicker of excitement as she hurriedly wiped her tears and dashed up the stairs, nearly stumbling on her way.“Careful!” Chloe shouted, her concern evident as she watched Racheal’s reckless ascent. Her mind was racing, trying to keep up with the whirlwind of emotions and decisions Racheal was making. “Slow down!”Chloe paced around the kitchen, her frustration palpable. What had happened to her friend? This wasn’t the Racheal she knew—this was someone caught in a delusional fantasy. Chloe shook her head, trying to make sense of the situation. “What on earth is going on with her?” she muttered to herself. “Who goes back to their vomit like this? Didn't she recall the number of nights she cried? She’s acting like she’s in some twisted fairytale.”Chloe took a deep breath, trying to steady her nerves. “Okay, Chloe, think. She’s clearly not thinking straight. You need to be there for her, even if she’s not making the best choices right now.”She grabbed her phone and dialed a number, hoping to get some perspective. “Hey, Emily? It’s Chloe. I need to talk to you about Racheal. She’s really lost it this time. Can you come over?”As she waited for Emily’s response, Chloe glanced at the staircase, her mind a whirlwind of concern and helplessness. She knew she couldn’t let Racheal face this situation alone, especially not in the state she was in. Chloe shook her head in disbelief, her frustration boiling over. “This woman is really gone,” she muttered under her breath.The situation was beyond frustrating; it was heartbreaking. Her friend, who had always been so strong, was now lost in a fantasy world where returning to Victor seemed like a feasible solution.Chapter 4 Crumbling CourageAs Racheal stepped out of the taxi, her heart pounded in her chest. She stood in front of Victor’s apartment complex, hesitating for a moment.The building looked the same as it always had, but today it felt different, more imposing. She took a deep breath, clutching her purse tightly as if it would somehow give her the courage she needed. This was it. She needed to do this, for her baby, for herself.With shaky hands, she made her way inside, climbing the stairs she once knew so well.Each step felt heavier than the last, memories flooding back of times she and Victor had spent together—times she desperately wanted to forget but couldn’t.She reached the apartment door and paused, hearing faint laughter from inside. She knocked, her knuckles tapping lightly at first, then louder as her nerves grew.The door swung open, and there stood Victor, his expression shifting from surprise to something colder when he saw her. Before she could speak, her eyes darted around the room, landing on Evelyn, whose face twisted into a scowl.“What the hell are you doing here?” Evelyn snapped, her voice laced with hostility. She stood from the couch, her hand resting protectively on her baby bump—a bump that mirrored Racheal’s own.Racheal’s breath caught in her throat as her gaze fell to Evelyn’s stomach. She was pregnant too. Of course, she was. Racheal felt a pang of jealousy and despair, knowing they were both carrying Victor’s children, but only one of them was wanted here.Victor stepped forward, blocking Racheal’s view of Evelyn. “Racheal, you shouldn’t have come,” he said flatly, his tone devoid of any warmth or familiarity.Racheal swallowed hard, trying to find her voice. “I just… I needed to talk to you. About the baby. About us.”“There is no ‘us,’ Racheal,” Victor said, his words cutting like a knife. “We’re done. I told you that.”Evelyn’s parents were sitting on the other side of the room, watching the scene unfold with disapproving eyes.Evelyn’s mother, who had once treated Racheal like a daughter, now looked at her like she was an intruder. Racheal felt their judgment, their silent accusations, and it stung.Evelyn folded her arms, her eyes narrowing. “You can’t just show up here and think you can mess things up for us. Victor has moved on, and so should you.”Racheal’s eyes welled with tears, but she blinked them away, trying to keep her composure. “I didn’t come here to mess things up. I just… I thought Victor should know about what’s going on. The doctor said—”Victor cut her off, his voice rising. “I don’t care what the doctor said, Racheal. This isn’t my problem anymore. You need to take care of your own mess.”Racheal’s lip trembled as she tried to hold back the flood of emotions. She glanced at Evelyn, who smirked, enjoying every second of Racheal’s humiliation.“You’ve got some nerve showing up here, playing the victim,” Evelyn said, her voice dripping with contempt. “Victor is with me now. We’re starting our family. You need to let go.”“You Know what, you're really pathetic, aren’t you, Racheal?” Evelyn sneered, her voice dripping with venom. “Coming here, begging like a stray dog.“ You think showing up with your sob story will change anything? Newsflash: Victor doesn’t want you. He never did. He was just too nice to tell you that he was using you.”Racheal felt the sting of Evelyn’s words like a slap to the face, but she clenched her fists, trying to stand her ground. “I’m not here to beg,” she said, her voice trembling. “I just wanted Victor to know—”“To know what?” Evelyn cut her off, her voice rising as she stepped closer. “Are you desperate? That you can’t handle the fact that he moved on? Look at you. You’re a joke, Racheal. You don’t belong here.”Evelyn’s mother, who had been watching with cold, calculating eyes, finally spoke up. She rose from her seat, her expression twisted with disdain.“I never understood what Victor saw in you,” she spat, her tone icy. “You’re nothing but a gold-digging tramp. I warned him about you from the beginning, but he was too blind to see it. Now you come here, parading that bastard child, trying to worm your way back into his life. Disgusting.”Racheal’s cheeks flushed red with humiliation, but before she could respond, Evelyn’s mother stepped forward, pointing an accusing finger in her face.“You should be ashamed of yourself, Racheal. Have you no dignity? No self-respect? You’re an embarrassment to yourself and to everyone around you.”Racheal staggered back, her mind racing with a mix of anger and heartbreak. She hadn’t expected kindness, but this? It was brutal. “I’m not here to cause trouble,” she managed to choke out, her voice breaking.Evelyn scoffed and shoved Racheal, hard. “Cause trouble? You are the trouble! You’re nothing but a leech, sucking the life out of everyone around you. Do us all a favor and crawl back into whatever hole you came from.”Racheal stumbled, her foot catching the edge of the carpet. She tried to regain her balance, but Evelyn’s mother pushed her roughly, her hands shoving Racheal back with unexpected force.“You just don’t know when to quit, do you?” Evelyn’s mother snarled. “Get out of here, you filthy little tramp!”Racheal’s feet slipped from under her, and before she could react, she went crashing down onto the hard floor, her belly taking the brunt of the fall.Pain shot through her stomach, sharp and immediate, and she gasped, clutching her bump as she tried to catch her breath. Tears streamed down her cheeks, not just from the pain but from the sheer cruelty of it all.Victor stood frozen, watching without lifting a finger to help. He just stared, his expression blank, as if she were nothing more than a nuisance—a problem he wished would disappear. Evelyn let out a mocking laugh, her voice shrill and cruel.“Look at you, on the floor where you belong,” Evelyn taunted, her voice cutting through Racheal’s pain like a knife. “Crawling around like the trash you are. I told you to get out, but you just don’t listen, do you?”Racheal struggled to push herself up, her entire body trembling. She cradled her belly, fear and panic surging through her. She didn’t know if her baby was okay, but the pain was unbearable. As she tried to stand, Evelyn’s foot shot out, kicking her back down.“You’re pathetic,” Evelyn said, towering over her. “No one wants you, Racheal. Not Victor, not your baby. You’re just a mistake. A burden.”Evelyn’s mother crossed her arms, looking down at Racheal as if she were dirt beneath her shoe. “You should have known better than to come here, Racheal. You’re nothing. You’ll always be nothing.”Racheal finally managed to get to her knees, her entire body aching. She looked up at Victor, silently begging for any sign of concern, but he just turned away, cold and distant. “I told you to leave,” he said, his voice flat. “Don’t make me say it again.”With every ounce of strength she had left, Racheal pulled herself up, biting back the sobs that threatened to escape. She was humiliated, hurt, and terrified, but she forced herself to hold her head high, even as her vision blurred with tears.“You’ll regret this, Victor,” she said, her voice hoarse but defiant. “All of you will.”And with that, she turned and stumbled out of the apartment, clutching her belly and praying that her baby would be okay.As she limped down the stairs, Evelyn’s laughter echoed in her ears, mocking her, taunting her. But Racheal didn’t look back. She couldn’t afford to. She had to keep moving forward, no matter how broken she felt inside.As Rachel went back home, she knew Chloe would either laugh at her or say, “I warned you.” The thought made her stomach churn.Chloe had been right all along, and Rachel hated how her friend’s warnings always seemed to come true. She could already imagine Chloe's smirk, the way she'd toss her hair and lean against the doorframe, arms crossed with that annoyingly knowing look.Rachel sighed, her grip tightening around the strap of her bag. “I told you so,” she could almost hear Chloe's voice echoing in her mind, playful yet laced with genuine concern.As much as she dreaded the teasing, Rachel knew Chloe’s words came from a place of love. It was the thought of facing her friend’s mockery that stung the most. Because deep down, Rachel wasn’t ready to admit that she had messed up—again.\*\*\*\*\*Rachel pushed open Chloe’s front door, dragging her feet as she stepped inside. Chloe was sprawled out on the couch, surrounded by snacks and an open laptop, binge-watching her favorite show.The moment she saw Rachel’s defeated expression, Chloe’s lips curled into a grin, unable to resist the urge to tease her.“Oh, my God,” Chloe burst into laughter, clapping her hands. “Don’t even say it. I knew it! I told you so, didn’t I?” She leaned back, still chuckling, enjoying her moment of being right. “I warned you, Rachel. But no, you just had to see for yourself.”Rachel tried to force a smile, but it crumbled under the weight of Chloe’s laughter.The sting of being wrong, of ignoring Chloe’s advice, hit her all at once. Tears welled in her eyes, and before she could stop herself, she broke down, sobbing uncontrollably. She covered her face, her whole body shaking as she sank onto the nearest chair.The sound of Rachel’s crying snapped Chloe out of her playful mood. Her laughter died instantly, replaced by concern.She jumped up, rushing over to her friend. “Oh, no, Rach…” Chloe murmured, guilt washing over her as she saw the tears streaming down Rachel’s cheeks. She hadn’t meant to hurt her like this.Without hesitation, Chloe pulled Rachel into a tight embrace, holding her close. “I’m so sorry,” she whispered, her voice thick with remorse. “I didn’t mean it like that. I’m just... I’m just worried about you.” Chloe stroked Rachel’s hair, rocking her gently as Rachel sobbed into her shoulder.Rachel clung to her, letting the tears fall freely. Chloe’s warmth and the soft murmur of her apologies eased some of the pain. Chloe tightened her grip, her voice softening. “I’m here, okay? I’ve got you.”They stayed like that, wrapped up in each other, until Rachel’s sobs quieted. Chloe held her a little tighter, making sure Rachel knew that no matter what, she would always be there to catch her when she fell. As Racheal hugged her friend she silently vowed that this was the last straw. She would make them pay!

They took her birthright. She came back to take the whole empire.
If this one’s on your radar, I might know where to peek"," Broken Promises Rachael rushed home, barely able to contain her excitement. The bright lines on the pregnancy test still seemed surreal. After years of trying, endless doctor visits, and nights spent crying in Victor’s arms, it was finally happening. She couldn’t wait to see his face when she told him. Today was the start of their happily ever after.She pulled into the driveway, her mind buzzing with a thousand thoughts of their future. Their baby. She clutched her purse tightly, the test still inside, and hurried into the house.But as soon as she stepped through the door, something felt wrong. The living room was in disarray—cushions tossed about, a wine glass half-empty on the coffee table, and clothes scattered like someone had rushed out of them.Rachael’s heart skipped a beat as she spotted the unfamiliar lingerie draped over the couch. She touched the lacy fabric, her fingers trembling. Panic set in. She blinked rapidly, trying to force a logical explanation into her mind. Maybe Victor’s sister was here, or—no, that didn’t make sense. Deep down, she knew.She dropped the lingerie, her breathing shallow and quick, and followed the trail of discarded clothes down the hall. The closer she got to the bedroom, the louder the muffled sounds became—moans and gasps, unmistakable and raw. Rachael’s vision blurred, her legs heavy like lead. She grabbed the doorframe, steadying herself. Every instinct screamed at her to turn back, to not look, but she pushed the door open.There, tangled in sheets and each other, were Victor and Evelyn. The sight hit Rachael like a punch to the gut, knocking the breath out of her. Her husband and her sister. The betrayal was overwhelming, a tidal wave crashing down, pulling her under.The pregnancy test slipped from her grasp, hitting the floor with a soft thud that went unnoticed. “What the hell is this?” Rachael’s voice cracked, half shriek, half sob. She felt as though she’d stepped into a nightmare she couldn’t wake up from. “Victor, Evelyn, what is this?”Victor scrambled off the bed, fumbling to cover himself. “Rachael, this isn’t—”But Evelyn didn’t even flinch. Instead, she smiled with a cold satisfaction that sent chills down Rachael’s spine. “Don’t look so shocked, Rachael,” she drawled. “Did you really think you deserved him? Pathetic.”Rachael’s vision blurred with tears. She turned to Victor, searching for any sign of regret, a hint that this was some terrible mistake. “Victor, after everything we’ve been through, after all we’ve done to build this life... How could you?” Her voice wavered, each word dripping with the pain of betrayal.Victor pulled on his shirt, avoiding her gaze, his face twisted in a mixture of guilt and frustration. “It’s not what you think, Rachael,” he started, but the weak excuse hung in the air like a bad joke.“Not what I think?” Rachael repeated, her voice rising in pitch as anger began to replace her shock. “You’re in bed with my sister! How many times has this happened? How long have you been lying to me?”Evelyn rolled her eyes, sitting up with deliberate slowness, as if savoring the moment. “Victor and I have been together for months. He’s tired of you, Rachael. Tired of your whining, your failures, your pathetic attempts to keep him interested.” She glanced at the pregnancy test lying on the floor, her lip curling. “And I’m guessing that didn’t go the way you hoped either.”Rachael’s heart clenched, her hand instinctively covering her abdomen as if trying to protect the fragile hope inside her. “You don’t know anything about me,” she spat, tears threatening to spill. “You’re nothing but a snake. Both of you.”Victor stepped forward, reaching for her, but Rachael jerked back, holding up a hand to keep him at a distance. “Don’t touch me,” she hissed. “I can’t believe I ever loved you. Either of you.”Evelyn’s mocking laughter filled the room, echoing in Rachael’s ears. “You’re so dramatic, Rachael. Victor doesn’t need your love. He needs someone who can give him what he wants. And that’s never been you.”Rachael’s fingers clenched into fists, the sting of Evelyn’s words hitting deeper than she wanted to admit. She turned to Victor one last time, her voice low and trembling. “I gave you everything, Victor. My heart, my trust, my years. And you threw it all away for... this?”Victor’s silence spoke louder than any excuse he could muster. His eyes darted away, shame flickering briefly before settling into a cold, detached expression. “Maybe it’s best if you just leave,” he said finally, his voice devoid of emotion. “Evelyn and I... we’re together now. And you... you deserve better than this.”Rachael stared at him, the weight of his words crushing her. There it was—the final nail in the coffin of her marriage, driven in by the man she had once thought she’d spend her life with. She backed away, her legs shaking, but she held her head high, refusing to let either of them see her break.“I hope you both rot,” she said quietly, her voice steady despite the tears burning her eyes. She turned and walked out, leaving the shattered remains of her dreams behind.Rachael slammed the door shut and started the car, her hands shaking as she gripped the steering wheel. She had no destination in mind; she just needed to get away.Away from the house that now felt like a graveyard of broken promises, away from the suffocating betrayal that threatened to choke her. The city blurred around her, the streetlights flickering past as she drove with no sense of direction, fueled only by anger and heartbreak.Her phone buzzed on the passenger seat, Victor’s name lighting up the screen. Rachael hesitated for a moment, the bile rising in her throat. She didn’t want to hear his voice, but curiosity—and fury—got the better of her. She snatched the phone and answered, her tone laced with venom. “What do you want!”Victor’s voice came through, cold and devoid of any remorse. “Rachael, I’ve instructed my lawyer to send over the divorce papers. Sign them. It’s over.”The casual finality of his words sent a fresh wave of rage through her. “You think you can just send me a piece of paper and that’s it? We’re done? After everything you put me through? You’re a pathetic, spineless coward, Victor.”Victor sighed, sounding more annoyed than guilty. “Rachael, let’s not make this harder than it needs to be. Evelyn and I are moving forward, and you should too.”“Moving forward?” Rachael’s voice rose, her anger spilling over. “You mean crawling into bed with my sister like the shameless, gutless bastard you are? You have no idea what loyalty or love means. You disgust me, Victor. You’re not a man—you’re a joke. A pathetic excuse of a husband who can’t even keep his pants zipped.”Victor’s tone hardened, defensive, “At least she fucks me and satisfies me better than you, bitch!” Victor yelled, his words slicing through the phone like a jagged knife. Rachael gasped, the wind knocked out of her as if she’d been punched. She clutched her chest, the pain spreading like wildfire—rage, disbelief, and heartbreak all mingling together.For a moment, she was stunned into silence, the venom in his voice lingering in her ears. But then the shock faded, replaced by a burning fury that surged through her veins. She wasn’t going to let him have the last word. Not like this.“Take that back, you good-for-nothing excuse of a man!” Rachael’s voice quivered, her anger bubbling over. “You think that pathetic insult means anything coming from you? You’re nothing, Victor! A spineless, worthless coward who can’t handle a real woman, so you settle for scraps. I gave you everything, and you threw it away for someone who’s just as cheap and hollow as you are!”Victor’s silence only fueled her fire. “You think Evelyn’s some prize? She’s a two-faced, backstabbing bitch, and you’re too blind to see you’re just her latest game. She’ll chew you up and spit you out when she’s done, just like she’s done with every other idiot who’s fallen for her act. You’re not special, Victor—you’re a fool. A damn fool who doesn’t even realize he’s lost the best thing he ever had.”Victor scoffed, but Rachael cut him off before he could speak. “You know what? I pity you. I pity you for thinking that sneaking around and betraying the one person who actually gave a damn about you makes you some kind of man. But you’re not a man.“ You’re a pathetic, insecure little boy who can’t stand the sight of himself in the mirror. And one day, when Evelyn’s done using you, when you’re alone and drowning in your own self-loathing, you’ll remember this moment. You’ll remember that you lost me because you were too stupid to see what you had.”She paused, breathing heavily, her chest heaving with every word. “So enjoy your trash, Victor. Enjoy every miserable second of the life you’ve chosen because you and Evelyn are a perfect match—two worthless, miserable souls destined to destroy each other. And when you come crawling back, begging for forgiveness, remember this: you are nothing to me. Nothing. And you never will be again.”With that, she ended the call, throwing the phone onto the seat beside her. Rachael’s hands were still shaking, but she felt lighter, freer. Victor’s words had stung, but her own felt like a release, a purging of all the anger and hurt she’d carried for so long.She wasn’t going to let Victor’s insults define her. She was going to rise above this, stronger than ever. And Victor? He could wallow in the mess he’d made of his life.Because Rachael was done with him. For good.Chapter 2 Breaking PointRacheal sank into her couch, her hands mindlessly reaching for the array of junk food scattered on the coffee table. Tears streamed down her cheeks, mixing with the saltiness of the chips she stuffed into her mouth.It had been a month since everything fell apart, and though she put on a brave face for the world, the cracks were deep, and her pain felt endless.Each day blurred into the next, filled with crying, overeating, and self-loathing. She had gained weight rapidly, her once healthy glow fading as she neglected herself, forgetting about the tiny heartbeat that depended on her.The sound of the front door opening snapped her out of her daze. Chloe, her best friend, walked in, her face brightening with a warm smile that quickly faded when she saw Racheal.There she was, slouched on the couch, her swollen eyes red from crying, her hair in disarray, and surrounded by empty wrappers. She looked like a broken shell of the vibrant woman Chloe once knew.""Racheal,"" Chloe said, her voice tinged with concern. ""You look like a sad potato left out in the sun too long."" She tried to make light of it, but her heart broke seeing her friend like this. ""Come on, babe. You can’t keep doing this to yourself.""Racheal sniffed, wiping her tears with the back of her hand. “I don’t know how to stop, Chloe. Everything just... hurts.”“It’s been a month, girl!” Chloe's voice rose, frustration edging her words as she tossed her bag onto the chair. “You’re still crying over that douchebag? He’s not worth it!”Racheal’s sobs intensified, her shoulders shaking with every breath. “I don’t know what to do anymore, Chloe!” she wailed, her voice cracking.“I have a child growing inside me, and there’s no father. It’s all too much.” She choked on her own words, tears mixing with snot as she messily wiped her face with the back of her hand. “I don’t know how to be strong for this baby when I feel so weak.”Chloe’s heart clenched at the sight of her best friend falling apart. She moved closer, gripping Racheal’s shoulders firmly, pulling her into a gentle embrace.“There, there, it’s okay, baby,” Chloe whispered, her voice soothing as she stroked Racheal’s hair, trying to comfort her through her own pain. She hated seeing Racheal like this—defeated, lost, and drowning in a sea of despair.But Racheal’s mind was still trapped, unable to accept the harsh reality of her situation. She hadn’t come to terms with Victor leaving, her thoughts clinging to the faint hope that maybe, just maybe, it was all a bad dream she’d eventually wake up from.She still half-expected to hear his keys jingling at the door, his voice filling the empty rooms. A delusional fantasy that she couldn’t shake, even though Victor had made his choice loud and clear—he was gone, and he wasn’t coming back.“You’re not alone in this,” Chloe murmured, holding Racheal tighter. “I know it feels like the end, but it’s not. We’re going to figure this out. You’re stronger than you think, and you don’t need him to be a great mom. We’ll get through this together.”After helping Racheal calm down, Chloe brushed her friend’s messy hair out of her face, trying to restore a sense of normalcy. “Come on,” Chloe said gently, standing up and offering her hand. “Let’s go to the kitchen. Help me whip up something good. It’ll take your mind off things.”Racheal hesitated but eventually took Chloe’s hand, letting her friend guide her to the kitchen. It was a small gesture, but Chloe knew that keeping Racheal busy, even for a few minutes, was better than letting her spiral deeper into her grief.Since the divorce, Chloe had been the only one taking care of her, practically moving in to ensure Racheal wasn’t completely alone with her thoughts. Chloe had become the sister Racheal always wished Evelyn could be, someone who actually cared.As they shuffled around the kitchen, Chloe’s eyes flicked to Racheal’s vacant stare. It was more than just heartbreak—there was a lifetime of hurt simmering beneath the surface. Racheal was an orphan, adopted by Evelyn’s parents when she was just a child. She had always tried to be good to but instead they treated her like trash.Chloe watched Racheal’s pained expression as she chopped the vegetables, her movements robotic and disconnected.It broke Chloe’s heart to see her best friend so lost, and she wished she could take the pain away, even if just for a moment. Chloe continued stirring the pot, her mind racing with ways to help Racheal rebuild, to remind her of the strong, resilient woman she used to be.“You know,” Chloe began, trying to keep her tone light, “we should do something fun, just us girls. A weekend getaway or even just a spa day. You need a break, Racheal. A real one.”Racheal gave a half-hearted smile, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “I don’t know, Chloe. I feel so... heavy. I can’t pretend to be okay when I’m not. Everywhere I turn, it’s like there’s a ghost of what I lost.”Chloe set the spoon down, wiping her hands on a dish towel as she walked over to Racheal. She took the knife from her friend’s trembling hands and pulled her into a tight hug. “You don’t have to be okay right now. But you have to keep moving, for yourself and for your baby. You are not defined by the people who hurt you.”Racheal leaned into the embrace, her eyes stinging with fresh tears. Chloe’s warmth was the only thing holding her together. “I just... I don’t know how to be anything other than this mess, Chloe. I thought I had everything figured out. I thought Victor and I would be together forever. But Evelyn—” Her voice wavered, anger mingling with the hurt. “She took everything from me. And now I’m just... empty.”Chloe pulled back slightly, cupping Racheal’s face in her hands. “Evelyn didn’t take everything. You still have yourself, and you still have me. You have your baby. And that’s a start.”Racheal was about to say something, her lips parting to speak, when the television suddenly blared with breaking news. Both women’s heads turned to the screen, where a flashy headline in bold, all-capital letters demanded their attention:“BILLIONAIRE VICTOR SEEN WITH EVELYN BLACKWOOD, SPORTING A BABY BUMP WHILE SHOPPING FOR BABY CLOTHES. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? IS VICTOR THE FATHER OF EVELYN’S BABY? AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS OTHER WIFE? STAY TUNED.”The words hit Racheal like a punch to the gut. She froze, her breath hitching as images of Victor and Evelyn filled the screen. There they were, smiling and looking every bit the happy couple as they strolled through the baby store, Evelyn’s swollen belly unmistakable. Victor’s hand rested protectively on her back, his face lit up with the same joy Racheal had once seen when he looked at her.Racheal’s vision blurred as tears welled up, the room spinning around her. It felt like she was watching her worst nightmare unfold in real time. The man who had vowed to love her, who she had once believed was her forever, was now flaunting his new life with the very person who had ripped her world apart.Chloe quickly grabbed the remote, fumbling to mute the TV, but it was too late. The damage was done. Racheal staggered back, her legs weak beneath her, and she clutched the counter for support. “No...” she whispered, her voice breaking as the tears she’d been holding back spilled over. “No, no, no. This can’t be happeningRacheal’s knees buckled, and she collapsed onto the kitchen floor, her hands clutching her chest as though she could physically hold her heart together. “I can't believe this! What! What the fuck!,” she repeated louder.She rocked back and forth, the disbelief twisting her insides. Each image of Victor and Evelyn together was like salt on an open wound, raw and unrelenting.Chloe dropped to her knees beside her, her heart breaking for her friend. “Racheal, listen to me,” she pleaded, holding Racheal’s trembling hands. “You have to breathe. Don’t let them destroy you. They aren’t worth this.”But Racheal couldn’t hear her. The weight of the betrayal was crushing her, pulling her under. Every dream she’d ever had—the white picket fence, the family, the life she’d built in her mind—was gone. All she could see was Evelyn, glowing and happy, living the life that should have been hers.“How could he do this to me?” Racheal sobbed, her tears flowing freely. “I gave him everything, Chloe. I was his wife. I loved him. And now… now he’s having a baby with her.” Her voice broke, and she buried her face in her hands, her shoulders shaking with the force of her grief.Chloe wrapped her arms around Racheal, her own eyes stinging with tears she refused to shed. “You are so much more than this moment,” she whispered fiercely. “I know it doesn’t feel like it now, but you will get through this. Victor is nothing but a liar, and Evelyn… she’s not worth your tears.”Racheal pulled away, wiping her face with the back of her hand, but the tears wouldn’t stop. “Why wasn’t I enough? Why did he choose her?” The questions spilled out, the doubts and fears she had buried since the divorce now laid bare. It wasn’t just anger; it was the deep, soul-crushing pain of not feeling worthy, of being discarded like she was nothing.Chloe shook her head, her grip tightening on Racheal’s arms. “This isn’t about you, Racheal. This is about them. They’re broken, selfish people, and they don’t deserve you. You are enough, more than enough, and one day, you’ll see that.”Racheal nodded, trying to muster the strength Chloe saw in her, but every breath felt like dragging her lungs through broken glass. Her vision blurred as the weight of everything pressed down on her chest, tighter and tighter. The room felt smaller, the air thinner, and she couldn’t shake the feeling of being trapped, suffocated by her own pain.Chloe’s voice seemed distant, her words a muffled echo that barely reached Racheal’s ears. “One step at a time,” Chloe repeated, her face full of concern. “We’ll get through this together.”But Racheal couldn’t respond. Her head was spinning, the edges of her vision darkening. She tried to stand, to shake off the dizziness, but her legs wobbled beneath her. She reached out, gripping the edge of the counter for support, but her fingers slipped, weak and trembling.“Racheal?” Chloe’s voice broke through, sharp with alarm. She stepped closer, watching as Racheal’s face drained of color. “Hey, are you okay? Racheal!”Racheal’s world tilted, and before she could process what was happening, her knees buckled. She collapsed, her body crumpling to the floor in a lifeless heap. The last thing she heard was Chloe’s frantic scream, her name echoing through the house as everything went black.Chapter 3 Desperate MeasuresAs Racheal lay unconscious on the kitchen floor, Chloe’s panic transformed into urgent action. She grabbed her phone with trembling hands and dialed the number for a local doctor.“Dr. Harper? This is Chloe Wright. My friend, Racheal—she’s collapsed. Please, we need help right away!” Her voice was a desperate rush, her heart pounding as she awaited the response.Within minutes, the doorbell rang. Chloe hurried to answer, admitting Dr. Harper, a calm and experienced physician. He quickly assessed Racheal’s condition, checking her pulse and examining her vital signs with practiced efficiency.“Chloe, can you give me a moment alone with Racheal?” Dr. Harper asked, his voice steady and reassuring.Chloe nodded, stepping aside but remaining close enough to hear. The doctor’s face was set in a serious expression as he worked, occasionally glancing at his medical bag and then back at Racheal.After a thorough examination, Dr. Harper stood up, looking concerned. “Racheal’s vital signs are stable now, but she’s under a lot of stress. I need to speak with her husband about her condition and the stress she’s been under. It’s crucial for her well-being.”Chloe’s eyes widened. “Her husband? Victor is... he’s not around anymore. He left her.”Dr. Harper looked puzzled, then reconsidered. “I see. Well, I’ll need to speak with someone close to her—maybe a family member or someone who can provide more context about her situation. It’s important to address the stressors affecting her health.”As Chloe absorbed the doctor’s words, Racheal began to stir, her eyes fluttering open. She slowly became aware of her surroundings, her gaze focusing on Chloe and the unfamiliar face of Dr. Harper.“What... happened?” Racheal mumbled, her voice weak.“You collapsed, Racheal,” Chloe explained gently. “Dr. Harper is here to help.”Racheal’s confusion cleared as she saw the concern etched on Chloe’s face. “Victor,” she whispered. “Did he—”“No, Victor isn’t here,” Chloe said firmly. “But we’ll get you the help you need. Dr. Harper, do you think there’s a way to help her through this without...?”Dr. Harper nodded. “We’ll start with what we can do here and ensure she’s stable. If there’s anyone else who can provide support or insight into her situation, it would be helpful.”After Dr Harper finished his examination and gave Racheal a serious look. “There are several tests that need to be carried out, and they require a significant amount of money. When you’re ready, you can come to the office to get the tests started. Take care of yourself, Miss. Have a good day.”With that, Dr. Harper packed his medical bag and left. Chloe watched him go, her mind racing with concern for her friend.Racheal, still disoriented but determined, pushed herself up from the floor. She looked at Chloe with a mix of desperation and resolve. “This is the call to get Victor back. I need to go to the apartment and tell him what the doctor said. Maybe he’ll come back if he knows how serious this is.”Chloe stared at her, disbelief etched on her face. “Racheal, are you kidding me? Victor’s left you. He’s with Evelyn now. You can’t just waltz back into his life and expect him to magically return.”Chloe’s frustration erupted as she paced the kitchen, her voice sharp. “Racheal, are you out of your mind? You seriously think that going back to Victor is going to fix anything? He’s moved on, and you’re still here, wallowing in this pit of despair. Are you fuvking stupid! Get over it! ”Racheal looked up, her face pale and tear-streaked. “Chloe, I just— I need to try. The doctor said the father needs to be involved. I can’t just sit here and do nothing.”“Try?” Chloe snapped, her hands on her hips. “Try what? Getting your heart broken again? You’ve been through hell already, and now you want to walk back into the fire?”“I know it sounds crazy,” Racheal said, her voice trembling. “But if there’s even a chance that Victor could come back, I have to take it. I can’t just sit here and wait for things to get worse.”Chloe’s face reddened with frustration. “You’re not thinking clearly, Racheal! This isn’t just about you anymore. You have a baby to think about. Do you really want to put yourself through more pain and risk your health for someone who clearly doesn’t care?”“I’m not doing this for me,” Racheal said firmly. “I’m doing this for my baby. The doctor said the father needs to be involved for tests, and I need to make sure everything’s alright.”Chloe threw her hands up in exasperation. “For tests? Is that what you’re focusing on right now? The fact that you’re trying to drag Victor back into your life, only to be potentially hurt again, is insane! What if he rejects you outright? What if he refuses to help with the baby?”“I have to try!” Racheal insisted, her eyes pleading. “I can’t just let him get away with everything. I need him to know what’s at stake.”Chloe’s anger was palpable as she breathed harder, her voice rising. “You’re going to lose yourself trying to fight for someone who’s already made his choice. What happens when he turns you away? You’ll be right back where you started, only now you’ll be even more broken! Use your brains Racheal! Stop being a desperate bitch! There are lots of dicks out there! Forget about him, girl!”Racheal’s face was a mask of determination mixed with anguish. “I don’t know what else to do. I feel like if I don’t try, I’ll never be able to forgive myself. I need to know that I did everything I could for our child.”Chloe’s shoulders slumped, her anger giving way to deep concern. “Racheal, you’re not thinking clearly. You need help! You're thinking like a fucking lunatic!This isn’t just about getting Victor back. It’s about your well-being and your baby’s future. You’re a mess right now, and the last thing you need is to add more emotional turmoil.”“I can’t just give up,” Racheal said, her voice breaking. “I can’t let him think he can just walk away and not have any consequences.”Chloe took a deep breath, trying to calm her racing thoughts. “Okay, fine. If you’re set on doing this, at least promise me you’ll be careful. Don’t go in there with expectations that he’ll magically come back or that everything will be okay. You need to protect yourself. But I promise you if you come here crying and hurt I'll tell you I told you so.”Racheal nodded, tears spilling down her cheeks. “I will. I just need to know that I tried. I can’t move on without knowing that I did everything possible.”Chloe’s face softened, though her frustration lingered. “Alright. But you need to be prepared for the possibility that this could end badly. Don’t let your hope blind you to the reality of the situation.”Racheal swallowed hard, her gaze resolute. “I understand. I just… I need to do this. I can’t move forward without trying.”“Let me go get my bag upstairs and put on some makeup. I need to look really good for him,” Racheal said, her voice laced with a flicker of excitement as she hurriedly wiped her tears and dashed up the stairs, nearly stumbling on her way.“Careful!” Chloe shouted, her concern evident as she watched Racheal’s reckless ascent. Her mind was racing, trying to keep up with the whirlwind of emotions and decisions Racheal was making. “Slow down!”Chloe paced around the kitchen, her frustration palpable. What had happened to her friend? This wasn’t the Racheal she knew—this was someone caught in a delusional fantasy. Chloe shook her head, trying to make sense of the situation. “What on earth is going on with her?” she muttered to herself. “Who goes back to their vomit like this? Didn't she recall the number of nights she cried? She’s acting like she’s in some twisted fairytale.”Chloe took a deep breath, trying to steady her nerves. “Okay, Chloe, think. She’s clearly not thinking straight. You need to be there for her, even if she’s not making the best choices right now.”She grabbed her phone and dialed a number, hoping to get some perspective. “Hey, Emily? It’s Chloe. I need to talk to you about Racheal. She’s really lost it this time. Can you come over?”As she waited for Emily’s response, Chloe glanced at the staircase, her mind a whirlwind of concern and helplessness. She knew she couldn’t let Racheal face this situation alone, especially not in the state she was in. Chloe shook her head in disbelief, her frustration boiling over. “This woman is really gone,” she muttered under her breath.The situation was beyond frustrating; it was heartbreaking. Her friend, who had always been so strong, was now lost in a fantasy world where returning to Victor seemed like a feasible solution.Chapter 4 Crumbling CourageAs Racheal stepped out of the taxi, her heart pounded in her chest. She stood in front of Victor’s apartment complex, hesitating for a moment.The building looked the same as it always had, but today it felt different, more imposing. She took a deep breath, clutching her purse tightly as if it would somehow give her the courage she needed. This was it. She needed to do this, for her baby, for herself.With shaky hands, she made her way inside, climbing the stairs she once knew so well.Each step felt heavier than the last, memories flooding back of times she and Victor had spent together—times she desperately wanted to forget but couldn’t.She reached the apartment door and paused, hearing faint laughter from inside. She knocked, her knuckles tapping lightly at first, then louder as her nerves grew.The door swung open, and there stood Victor, his expression shifting from surprise to something colder when he saw her. Before she could speak, her eyes darted around the room, landing on Evelyn, whose face twisted into a scowl.“What the hell are you doing here?” Evelyn snapped, her voice laced with hostility. She stood from the couch, her hand resting protectively on her baby bump—a bump that mirrored Racheal’s own.Racheal’s breath caught in her throat as her gaze fell to Evelyn’s stomach. She was pregnant too. Of course, she was. Racheal felt a pang of jealousy and despair, knowing they were both carrying Victor’s children, but only one of them was wanted here.Victor stepped forward, blocking Racheal’s view of Evelyn. “Racheal, you shouldn’t have come,” he said flatly, his tone devoid of any warmth or familiarity.Racheal swallowed hard, trying to find her voice. “I just… I needed to talk to you. About the baby. About us.”“There is no ‘us,’ Racheal,” Victor said, his words cutting like a knife. “We’re done. I told you that.”Evelyn’s parents were sitting on the other side of the room, watching the scene unfold with disapproving eyes.Evelyn’s mother, who had once treated Racheal like a daughter, now looked at her like she was an intruder. Racheal felt their judgment, their silent accusations, and it stung.Evelyn folded her arms, her eyes narrowing. “You can’t just show up here and think you can mess things up for us. Victor has moved on, and so should you.”Racheal’s eyes welled with tears, but she blinked them away, trying to keep her composure. “I didn’t come here to mess things up. I just… I thought Victor should know about what’s going on. The doctor said—”Victor cut her off, his voice rising. “I don’t care what the doctor said, Racheal. This isn’t my problem anymore. You need to take care of your own mess.”Racheal’s lip trembled as she tried to hold back the flood of emotions. She glanced at Evelyn, who smirked, enjoying every second of Racheal’s humiliation.“You’ve got some nerve showing up here, playing the victim,” Evelyn said, her voice dripping with contempt. “Victor is with me now. We’re starting our family. You need to let go.”“You Know what, you're really pathetic, aren’t you, Racheal?” Evelyn sneered, her voice dripping with venom. “Coming here, begging like a stray dog.“ You think showing up with your sob story will change anything? Newsflash: Victor doesn’t want you. He never did. He was just too nice to tell you that he was using you.”Racheal felt the sting of Evelyn’s words like a slap to the face, but she clenched her fists, trying to stand her ground. “I’m not here to beg,” she said, her voice trembling. “I just wanted Victor to know—”“To know what?” Evelyn cut her off, her voice rising as she stepped closer. “Are you desperate? That you can’t handle the fact that he moved on? Look at you. You’re a joke, Racheal. You don’t belong here.”Evelyn’s mother, who had been watching with cold, calculating eyes, finally spoke up. She rose from her seat, her expression twisted with disdain.“I never understood what Victor saw in you,” she spat, her tone icy. “You’re nothing but a gold-digging tramp. I warned him about you from the beginning, but he was too blind to see it. Now you come here, parading that bastard child, trying to worm your way back into his life. Disgusting.”Racheal’s cheeks flushed red with humiliation, but before she could respond, Evelyn’s mother stepped forward, pointing an accusing finger in her face.“You should be ashamed of yourself, Racheal. Have you no dignity? No self-respect? You’re an embarrassment to yourself and to everyone around you.”Racheal staggered back, her mind racing with a mix of anger and heartbreak. She hadn’t expected kindness, but this? It was brutal. “I’m not here to cause trouble,” she managed to choke out, her voice breaking.Evelyn scoffed and shoved Racheal, hard. “Cause trouble? You are the trouble! You’re nothing but a leech, sucking the life out of everyone around you. Do us all a favor and crawl back into whatever hole you came from.”Racheal stumbled, her foot catching the edge of the carpet. She tried to regain her balance, but Evelyn’s mother pushed her roughly, her hands shoving Racheal back with unexpected force.“You just don’t know when to quit, do you?” Evelyn’s mother snarled. “Get out of here, you filthy little tramp!”Racheal’s feet slipped from under her, and before she could react, she went crashing down onto the hard floor, her belly taking the brunt of the fall.Pain shot through her stomach, sharp and immediate, and she gasped, clutching her bump as she tried to catch her breath. Tears streamed down her cheeks, not just from the pain but from the sheer cruelty of it all.Victor stood frozen, watching without lifting a finger to help. He just stared, his expression blank, as if she were nothing more than a nuisance—a problem he wished would disappear. Evelyn let out a mocking laugh, her voice shrill and cruel.“Look at you, on the floor where you belong,” Evelyn taunted, her voice cutting through Racheal’s pain like a knife. “Crawling around like the trash you are. I told you to get out, but you just don’t listen, do you?”Racheal struggled to push herself up, her entire body trembling. She cradled her belly, fear and panic surging through her. She didn’t know if her baby was okay, but the pain was unbearable. As she tried to stand, Evelyn’s foot shot out, kicking her back down.“You’re pathetic,” Evelyn said, towering over her. “No one wants you, Racheal. Not Victor, not your baby. You’re just a mistake. A burden.”Evelyn’s mother crossed her arms, looking down at Racheal as if she were dirt beneath her shoe. “You should have known better than to come here, Racheal. You’re nothing. You’ll always be nothing.”Racheal finally managed to get to her knees, her entire body aching. She looked up at Victor, silently begging for any sign of concern, but he just turned away, cold and distant. “I told you to leave,” he said, his voice flat. “Don’t make me say it again.”With every ounce of strength she had left, Racheal pulled herself up, biting back the sobs that threatened to escape. She was humiliated, hurt, and terrified, but she forced herself to hold her head high, even as her vision blurred with tears.“You’ll regret this, Victor,” she said, her voice hoarse but defiant. “All of you will.”And with that, she turned and stumbled out of the apartment, clutching her belly and praying that her baby would be okay.As she limped down the stairs, Evelyn’s laughter echoed in her ears, mocking her, taunting her. But Racheal didn’t look back. She couldn’t afford to. She had to keep moving forward, no matter how broken she felt inside.As Rachel went back home, she knew Chloe would either laugh at her or say, “I warned you.” The thought made her stomach churn.Chloe had been right all along, and Rachel hated how her friend’s warnings always seemed to come true. She could already imagine Chloe's smirk, the way she'd toss her hair and lean against the doorframe, arms crossed with that annoyingly knowing look.Rachel sighed, her grip tightening around the strap of her bag. “I told you so,” she could almost hear Chloe's voice echoing in her mind, playful yet laced with genuine concern.As much as she dreaded the teasing, Rachel knew Chloe’s words came from a place of love. It was the thought of facing her friend’s mockery that stung the most. Because deep down, Rachel wasn’t ready to admit that she had messed up—again.\*\*\*\*\*Rachel pushed open Chloe’s front door, dragging her feet as she stepped inside. Chloe was sprawled out on the couch, surrounded by snacks and an open laptop, binge-watching her favorite show.The moment she saw Rachel’s defeated expression, Chloe’s lips curled into a grin, unable to resist the urge to tease her.“Oh, my God,” Chloe burst into laughter, clapping her hands. “Don’t even say it. I knew it! I told you so, didn’t I?” She leaned back, still chuckling, enjoying her moment of being right. “I warned you, Rachel. But no, you just had to see for yourself.”Rachel tried to force a smile, but it crumbled under the weight of Chloe’s laughter.The sting of being wrong, of ignoring Chloe’s advice, hit her all at once. Tears welled in her eyes, and before she could stop herself, she broke down, sobbing uncontrollably. She covered her face, her whole body shaking as she sank onto the nearest chair.The sound of Rachel’s crying snapped Chloe out of her playful mood. Her laughter died instantly, replaced by concern.She jumped up, rushing over to her friend. “Oh, no, Rach…” Chloe murmured, guilt washing over her as she saw the tears streaming down Rachel’s cheeks. She hadn’t meant to hurt her like this.Without hesitation, Chloe pulled Rachel into a tight embrace, holding her close. “I’m so sorry,” she whispered, her voice thick with remorse. “I didn’t mean it like that. I’m just... I’m just worried about you.” Chloe stroked Rachel’s hair, rocking her gently as Rachel sobbed into her shoulder.Rachel clung to her, letting the tears fall freely. Chloe’s warmth and the soft murmur of her apologies eased some of the pain. Chloe tightened her grip, her voice softening. “I’m here, okay? I’ve got you.”They stayed like that, wrapped up in each other, until Rachel’s sobs quieted. Chloe held her a little tighter, making sure Rachel knew that no matter what, she would always be there to catch her when she fell. As Racheal hugged her friend she silently vowed that this was the last straw. She would make them pay!

Raised like she was disposable… turns out she’s the one with everything.
Lowkey have a version if anyone’s been searching"," Broken Promises Rachael rushed home, barely able to contain her excitement. The bright lines on the pregnancy test still seemed surreal. After years of trying, endless doctor visits, and nights spent crying in Victor’s arms, it was finally happening. She couldn’t wait to see his face when she told him. Today was the start of their happily ever after.She pulled into the driveway, her mind buzzing with a thousand thoughts of their future. Their baby. She clutched her purse tightly, the test still inside, and hurried into the house.But as soon as she stepped through the door, something felt wrong. The living room was in disarray—cushions tossed about, a wine glass half-empty on the coffee table, and clothes scattered like someone had rushed out of them.Rachael’s heart skipped a beat as she spotted the unfamiliar lingerie draped over the couch. She touched the lacy fabric, her fingers trembling. Panic set in. She blinked rapidly, trying to force a logical explanation into her mind. Maybe Victor’s sister was here, or—no, that didn’t make sense. Deep down, she knew.She dropped the lingerie, her breathing shallow and quick, and followed the trail of discarded clothes down the hall. The closer she got to the bedroom, the louder the muffled sounds became—moans and gasps, unmistakable and raw. Rachael’s vision blurred, her legs heavy like lead. She grabbed the doorframe, steadying herself. Every instinct screamed at her to turn back, to not look, but she pushed the door open.There, tangled in sheets and each other, were Victor and Evelyn. The sight hit Rachael like a punch to the gut, knocking the breath out of her. Her husband and her sister. The betrayal was overwhelming, a tidal wave crashing down, pulling her under.The pregnancy test slipped from her grasp, hitting the floor with a soft thud that went unnoticed. “What the hell is this?” Rachael’s voice cracked, half shriek, half sob. She felt as though she’d stepped into a nightmare she couldn’t wake up from. “Victor, Evelyn, what is this?”Victor scrambled off the bed, fumbling to cover himself. “Rachael, this isn’t—”But Evelyn didn’t even flinch. Instead, she smiled with a cold satisfaction that sent chills down Rachael’s spine. “Don’t look so shocked, Rachael,” she drawled. “Did you really think you deserved him? Pathetic.”Rachael’s vision blurred with tears. She turned to Victor, searching for any sign of regret, a hint that this was some terrible mistake. “Victor, after everything we’ve been through, after all we’ve done to build this life... How could you?” Her voice wavered, each word dripping with the pain of betrayal.Victor pulled on his shirt, avoiding her gaze, his face twisted in a mixture of guilt and frustration. “It’s not what you think, Rachael,” he started, but the weak excuse hung in the air like a bad joke.“Not what I think?” Rachael repeated, her voice rising in pitch as anger began to replace her shock. “You’re in bed with my sister! How many times has this happened? How long have you been lying to me?”Evelyn rolled her eyes, sitting up with deliberate slowness, as if savoring the moment. “Victor and I have been together for months. He’s tired of you, Rachael. Tired of your whining, your failures, your pathetic attempts to keep him interested.” She glanced at the pregnancy test lying on the floor, her lip curling. “And I’m guessing that didn’t go the way you hoped either.”Rachael’s heart clenched, her hand instinctively covering her abdomen as if trying to protect the fragile hope inside her. “You don’t know anything about me,” she spat, tears threatening to spill. “You’re nothing but a snake. Both of you.”Victor stepped forward, reaching for her, but Rachael jerked back, holding up a hand to keep him at a distance. “Don’t touch me,” she hissed. “I can’t believe I ever loved you. Either of you.”Evelyn’s mocking laughter filled the room, echoing in Rachael’s ears. “You’re so dramatic, Rachael. Victor doesn’t need your love. He needs someone who can give him what he wants. And that’s never been you.”Rachael’s fingers clenched into fists, the sting of Evelyn’s words hitting deeper than she wanted to admit. She turned to Victor one last time, her voice low and trembling. “I gave you everything, Victor. My heart, my trust, my years. And you threw it all away for... this?”Victor’s silence spoke louder than any excuse he could muster. His eyes darted away, shame flickering briefly before settling into a cold, detached expression. “Maybe it’s best if you just leave,” he said finally, his voice devoid of emotion. “Evelyn and I... we’re together now. And you... you deserve better than this.”Rachael stared at him, the weight of his words crushing her. There it was—the final nail in the coffin of her marriage, driven in by the man she had once thought she’d spend her life with. She backed away, her legs shaking, but she held her head high, refusing to let either of them see her break.“I hope you both rot,” she said quietly, her voice steady despite the tears burning her eyes. She turned and walked out, leaving the shattered remains of her dreams behind.Rachael slammed the door shut and started the car, her hands shaking as she gripped the steering wheel. She had no destination in mind; she just needed to get away.Away from the house that now felt like a graveyard of broken promises, away from the suffocating betrayal that threatened to choke her. The city blurred around her, the streetlights flickering past as she drove with no sense of direction, fueled only by anger and heartbreak.Her phone buzzed on the passenger seat, Victor’s name lighting up the screen. Rachael hesitated for a moment, the bile rising in her throat. She didn’t want to hear his voice, but curiosity—and fury—got the better of her. She snatched the phone and answered, her tone laced with venom. “What do you want!”Victor’s voice came through, cold and devoid of any remorse. “Rachael, I’ve instructed my lawyer to send over the divorce papers. Sign them. It’s over.”The casual finality of his words sent a fresh wave of rage through her. “You think you can just send me a piece of paper and that’s it? We’re done? After everything you put me through? You’re a pathetic, spineless coward, Victor.”Victor sighed, sounding more annoyed than guilty. “Rachael, let’s not make this harder than it needs to be. Evelyn and I are moving forward, and you should too.”“Moving forward?” Rachael’s voice rose, her anger spilling over. “You mean crawling into bed with my sister like the shameless, gutless bastard you are? You have no idea what loyalty or love means. You disgust me, Victor. You’re not a man—you’re a joke. A pathetic excuse of a husband who can’t even keep his pants zipped.”Victor’s tone hardened, defensive, “At least she fucks me and satisfies me better than you, bitch!” Victor yelled, his words slicing through the phone like a jagged knife. Rachael gasped, the wind knocked out of her as if she’d been punched. She clutched her chest, the pain spreading like wildfire—rage, disbelief, and heartbreak all mingling together.For a moment, she was stunned into silence, the venom in his voice lingering in her ears. But then the shock faded, replaced by a burning fury that surged through her veins. She wasn’t going to let him have the last word. Not like this.“Take that back, you good-for-nothing excuse of a man!” Rachael’s voice quivered, her anger bubbling over. “You think that pathetic insult means anything coming from you? You’re nothing, Victor! A spineless, worthless coward who can’t handle a real woman, so you settle for scraps. I gave you everything, and you threw it away for someone who’s just as cheap and hollow as you are!”Victor’s silence only fueled her fire. “You think Evelyn’s some prize? She’s a two-faced, backstabbing bitch, and you’re too blind to see you’re just her latest game. She’ll chew you up and spit you out when she’s done, just like she’s done with every other idiot who’s fallen for her act. You’re not special, Victor—you’re a fool. A damn fool who doesn’t even realize he’s lost the best thing he ever had.”Victor scoffed, but Rachael cut him off before he could speak. “You know what? I pity you. I pity you for thinking that sneaking around and betraying the one person who actually gave a damn about you makes you some kind of man. But you’re not a man.“ You’re a pathetic, insecure little boy who can’t stand the sight of himself in the mirror. And one day, when Evelyn’s done using you, when you’re alone and drowning in your own self-loathing, you’ll remember this moment. You’ll remember that you lost me because you were too stupid to see what you had.”She paused, breathing heavily, her chest heaving with every word. “So enjoy your trash, Victor. Enjoy every miserable second of the life you’ve chosen because you and Evelyn are a perfect match—two worthless, miserable souls destined to destroy each other. And when you come crawling back, begging for forgiveness, remember this: you are nothing to me. Nothing. And you never will be again.”With that, she ended the call, throwing the phone onto the seat beside her. Rachael’s hands were still shaking, but she felt lighter, freer. Victor’s words had stung, but her own felt like a release, a purging of all the anger and hurt she’d carried for so long.She wasn’t going to let Victor’s insults define her. She was going to rise above this, stronger than ever. And Victor? He could wallow in the mess he’d made of his life.Because Rachael was done with him. For good.Chapter 2 Breaking PointRacheal sank into her couch, her hands mindlessly reaching for the array of junk food scattered on the coffee table. Tears streamed down her cheeks, mixing with the saltiness of the chips she stuffed into her mouth.It had been a month since everything fell apart, and though she put on a brave face for the world, the cracks were deep, and her pain felt endless.Each day blurred into the next, filled with crying, overeating, and self-loathing. She had gained weight rapidly, her once healthy glow fading as she neglected herself, forgetting about the tiny heartbeat that depended on her.The sound of the front door opening snapped her out of her daze. Chloe, her best friend, walked in, her face brightening with a warm smile that quickly faded when she saw Racheal.There she was, slouched on the couch, her swollen eyes red from crying, her hair in disarray, and surrounded by empty wrappers. She looked like a broken shell of the vibrant woman Chloe once knew.""Racheal,"" Chloe said, her voice tinged with concern. ""You look like a sad potato left out in the sun too long."" She tried to make light of it, but her heart broke seeing her friend like this. ""Come on, babe. You can’t keep doing this to yourself.""Racheal sniffed, wiping her tears with the back of her hand. “I don’t know how to stop, Chloe. Everything just... hurts.”“It’s been a month, girl!” Chloe's voice rose, frustration edging her words as she tossed her bag onto the chair. “You’re still crying over that douchebag? He’s not worth it!”Racheal’s sobs intensified, her shoulders shaking with every breath. “I don’t know what to do anymore, Chloe!” she wailed, her voice cracking.“I have a child growing inside me, and there’s no father. It’s all too much.” She choked on her own words, tears mixing with snot as she messily wiped her face with the back of her hand. “I don’t know how to be strong for this baby when I feel so weak.”Chloe’s heart clenched at the sight of her best friend falling apart. She moved closer, gripping Racheal’s shoulders firmly, pulling her into a gentle embrace.“There, there, it’s okay, baby,” Chloe whispered, her voice soothing as she stroked Racheal’s hair, trying to comfort her through her own pain. She hated seeing Racheal like this—defeated, lost, and drowning in a sea of despair.But Racheal’s mind was still trapped, unable to accept the harsh reality of her situation. She hadn’t come to terms with Victor leaving, her thoughts clinging to the faint hope that maybe, just maybe, it was all a bad dream she’d eventually wake up from.She still half-expected to hear his keys jingling at the door, his voice filling the empty rooms. A delusional fantasy that she couldn’t shake, even though Victor had made his choice loud and clear—he was gone, and he wasn’t coming back.“You’re not alone in this,” Chloe murmured, holding Racheal tighter. “I know it feels like the end, but it’s not. We’re going to figure this out. You’re stronger than you think, and you don’t need him to be a great mom. We’ll get through this together.”After helping Racheal calm down, Chloe brushed her friend’s messy hair out of her face, trying to restore a sense of normalcy. “Come on,” Chloe said gently, standing up and offering her hand. “Let’s go to the kitchen. Help me whip up something good. It’ll take your mind off things.”Racheal hesitated but eventually took Chloe’s hand, letting her friend guide her to the kitchen. It was a small gesture, but Chloe knew that keeping Racheal busy, even for a few minutes, was better than letting her spiral deeper into her grief.Since the divorce, Chloe had been the only one taking care of her, practically moving in to ensure Racheal wasn’t completely alone with her thoughts. Chloe had become the sister Racheal always wished Evelyn could be, someone who actually cared.As they shuffled around the kitchen, Chloe’s eyes flicked to Racheal’s vacant stare. It was more than just heartbreak—there was a lifetime of hurt simmering beneath the surface. Racheal was an orphan, adopted by Evelyn’s parents when she was just a child. She had always tried to be good to but instead they treated her like trash.Chloe watched Racheal’s pained expression as she chopped the vegetables, her movements robotic and disconnected.It broke Chloe’s heart to see her best friend so lost, and she wished she could take the pain away, even if just for a moment. Chloe continued stirring the pot, her mind racing with ways to help Racheal rebuild, to remind her of the strong, resilient woman she used to be.“You know,” Chloe began, trying to keep her tone light, “we should do something fun, just us girls. A weekend getaway or even just a spa day. You need a break, Racheal. A real one.”Racheal gave a half-hearted smile, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “I don’t know, Chloe. I feel so... heavy. I can’t pretend to be okay when I’m not. Everywhere I turn, it’s like there’s a ghost of what I lost.”Chloe set the spoon down, wiping her hands on a dish towel as she walked over to Racheal. She took the knife from her friend’s trembling hands and pulled her into a tight hug. “You don’t have to be okay right now. But you have to keep moving, for yourself and for your baby. You are not defined by the people who hurt you.”Racheal leaned into the embrace, her eyes stinging with fresh tears. Chloe’s warmth was the only thing holding her together. “I just... I don’t know how to be anything other than this mess, Chloe. I thought I had everything figured out. I thought Victor and I would be together forever. But Evelyn—” Her voice wavered, anger mingling with the hurt. “She took everything from me. And now I’m just... empty.”Chloe pulled back slightly, cupping Racheal’s face in her hands. “Evelyn didn’t take everything. You still have yourself, and you still have me. You have your baby. And that’s a start.”Racheal was about to say something, her lips parting to speak, when the television suddenly blared with breaking news. Both women’s heads turned to the screen, where a flashy headline in bold, all-capital letters demanded their attention:“BILLIONAIRE VICTOR SEEN WITH EVELYN BLACKWOOD, SPORTING A BABY BUMP WHILE SHOPPING FOR BABY CLOTHES. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? IS VICTOR THE FATHER OF EVELYN’S BABY? AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS OTHER WIFE? STAY TUNED.”The words hit Racheal like a punch to the gut. She froze, her breath hitching as images of Victor and Evelyn filled the screen. There they were, smiling and looking every bit the happy couple as they strolled through the baby store, Evelyn’s swollen belly unmistakable. Victor’s hand rested protectively on her back, his face lit up with the same joy Racheal had once seen when he looked at her.Racheal’s vision blurred as tears welled up, the room spinning around her. It felt like she was watching her worst nightmare unfold in real time. The man who had vowed to love her, who she had once believed was her forever, was now flaunting his new life with the very person who had ripped her world apart.Chloe quickly grabbed the remote, fumbling to mute the TV, but it was too late. The damage was done. Racheal staggered back, her legs weak beneath her, and she clutched the counter for support. “No...” she whispered, her voice breaking as the tears she’d been holding back spilled over. “No, no, no. This can’t be happeningRacheal’s knees buckled, and she collapsed onto the kitchen floor, her hands clutching her chest as though she could physically hold her heart together. “I can't believe this! What! What the fuck!,” she repeated louder.She rocked back and forth, the disbelief twisting her insides. Each image of Victor and Evelyn together was like salt on an open wound, raw and unrelenting.Chloe dropped to her knees beside her, her heart breaking for her friend. “Racheal, listen to me,” she pleaded, holding Racheal’s trembling hands. “You have to breathe. Don’t let them destroy you. They aren’t worth this.”But Racheal couldn’t hear her. The weight of the betrayal was crushing her, pulling her under. Every dream she’d ever had—the white picket fence, the family, the life she’d built in her mind—was gone. All she could see was Evelyn, glowing and happy, living the life that should have been hers.“How could he do this to me?” Racheal sobbed, her tears flowing freely. “I gave him everything, Chloe. I was his wife. I loved him. And now… now he’s having a baby with her.” Her voice broke, and she buried her face in her hands, her shoulders shaking with the force of her grief.Chloe wrapped her arms around Racheal, her own eyes stinging with tears she refused to shed. “You are so much more than this moment,” she whispered fiercely. “I know it doesn’t feel like it now, but you will get through this. Victor is nothing but a liar, and Evelyn… she’s not worth your tears.”Racheal pulled away, wiping her face with the back of her hand, but the tears wouldn’t stop. “Why wasn’t I enough? Why did he choose her?” The questions spilled out, the doubts and fears she had buried since the divorce now laid bare. It wasn’t just anger; it was the deep, soul-crushing pain of not feeling worthy, of being discarded like she was nothing.Chloe shook her head, her grip tightening on Racheal’s arms. “This isn’t about you, Racheal. This is about them. They’re broken, selfish people, and they don’t deserve you. You are enough, more than enough, and one day, you’ll see that.”Racheal nodded, trying to muster the strength Chloe saw in her, but every breath felt like dragging her lungs through broken glass. Her vision blurred as the weight of everything pressed down on her chest, tighter and tighter. The room felt smaller, the air thinner, and she couldn’t shake the feeling of being trapped, suffocated by her own pain.Chloe’s voice seemed distant, her words a muffled echo that barely reached Racheal’s ears. “One step at a time,” Chloe repeated, her face full of concern. “We’ll get through this together.”But Racheal couldn’t respond. Her head was spinning, the edges of her vision darkening. She tried to stand, to shake off the dizziness, but her legs wobbled beneath her. She reached out, gripping the edge of the counter for support, but her fingers slipped, weak and trembling.“Racheal?” Chloe’s voice broke through, sharp with alarm. She stepped closer, watching as Racheal’s face drained of color. “Hey, are you okay? Racheal!”Racheal’s world tilted, and before she could process what was happening, her knees buckled. She collapsed, her body crumpling to the floor in a lifeless heap. The last thing she heard was Chloe’s frantic scream, her name echoing through the house as everything went black.Chapter 3 Desperate MeasuresAs Racheal lay unconscious on the kitchen floor, Chloe’s panic transformed into urgent action. She grabbed her phone with trembling hands and dialed the number for a local doctor.“Dr. Harper? This is Chloe Wright. My friend, Racheal—she’s collapsed. Please, we need help right away!” Her voice was a desperate rush, her heart pounding as she awaited the response.Within minutes, the doorbell rang. Chloe hurried to answer, admitting Dr. Harper, a calm and experienced physician. He quickly assessed Racheal’s condition, checking her pulse and examining her vital signs with practiced efficiency.“Chloe, can you give me a moment alone with Racheal?” Dr. Harper asked, his voice steady and reassuring.Chloe nodded, stepping aside but remaining close enough to hear. The doctor’s face was set in a serious expression as he worked, occasionally glancing at his medical bag and then back at Racheal.After a thorough examination, Dr. Harper stood up, looking concerned. “Racheal’s vital signs are stable now, but she’s under a lot of stress. I need to speak with her husband about her condition and the stress she’s been under. It’s crucial for her well-being.”Chloe’s eyes widened. “Her husband? Victor is... he’s not around anymore. He left her.”Dr. Harper looked puzzled, then reconsidered. “I see. Well, I’ll need to speak with someone close to her—maybe a family member or someone who can provide more context about her situation. It’s important to address the stressors affecting her health.”As Chloe absorbed the doctor’s words, Racheal began to stir, her eyes fluttering open. She slowly became aware of her surroundings, her gaze focusing on Chloe and the unfamiliar face of Dr. Harper.“What... happened?” Racheal mumbled, her voice weak.“You collapsed, Racheal,” Chloe explained gently. “Dr. Harper is here to help.”Racheal’s confusion cleared as she saw the concern etched on Chloe’s face. “Victor,” she whispered. “Did he—”“No, Victor isn’t here,” Chloe said firmly. “But we’ll get you the help you need. Dr. Harper, do you think there’s a way to help her through this without...?”Dr. Harper nodded. “We’ll start with what we can do here and ensure she’s stable. If there’s anyone else who can provide support or insight into her situation, it would be helpful.”After Dr Harper finished his examination and gave Racheal a serious look. “There are several tests that need to be carried out, and they require a significant amount of money. When you’re ready, you can come to the office to get the tests started. Take care of yourself, Miss. Have a good day.”With that, Dr. Harper packed his medical bag and left. Chloe watched him go, her mind racing with concern for her friend.Racheal, still disoriented but determined, pushed herself up from the floor. She looked at Chloe with a mix of desperation and resolve. “This is the call to get Victor back. I need to go to the apartment and tell him what the doctor said. Maybe he’ll come back if he knows how serious this is.”Chloe stared at her, disbelief etched on her face. “Racheal, are you kidding me? Victor’s left you. He’s with Evelyn now. You can’t just waltz back into his life and expect him to magically return.”Chloe’s frustration erupted as she paced the kitchen, her voice sharp. “Racheal, are you out of your mind? You seriously think that going back to Victor is going to fix anything? He’s moved on, and you’re still here, wallowing in this pit of despair. Are you fuvking stupid! Get over it! ”Racheal looked up, her face pale and tear-streaked. “Chloe, I just— I need to try. The doctor said the father needs to be involved. I can’t just sit here and do nothing.”“Try?” Chloe snapped, her hands on her hips. “Try what? Getting your heart broken again? You’ve been through hell already, and now you want to walk back into the fire?”“I know it sounds crazy,” Racheal said, her voice trembling. “But if there’s even a chance that Victor could come back, I have to take it. I can’t just sit here and wait for things to get worse.”Chloe’s face reddened with frustration. “You’re not thinking clearly, Racheal! This isn’t just about you anymore. You have a baby to think about. Do you really want to put yourself through more pain and risk your health for someone who clearly doesn’t care?”“I’m not doing this for me,” Racheal said firmly. “I’m doing this for my baby. The doctor said the father needs to be involved for tests, and I need to make sure everything’s alright.”Chloe threw her hands up in exasperation. “For tests? Is that what you’re focusing on right now? The fact that you’re trying to drag Victor back into your life, only to be potentially hurt again, is insane! What if he rejects you outright? What if he refuses to help with the baby?”“I have to try!” Racheal insisted, her eyes pleading. “I can’t just let him get away with everything. I need him to know what’s at stake.”Chloe’s anger was palpable as she breathed harder, her voice rising. “You’re going to lose yourself trying to fight for someone who’s already made his choice. What happens when he turns you away? You’ll be right back where you started, only now you’ll be even more broken! Use your brains Racheal! Stop being a desperate bitch! There are lots of dicks out there! Forget about him, girl!”Racheal’s face was a mask of determination mixed with anguish. “I don’t know what else to do. I feel like if I don’t try, I’ll never be able to forgive myself. I need to know that I did everything I could for our child.”Chloe’s shoulders slumped, her anger giving way to deep concern. “Racheal, you’re not thinking clearly. You need help! You're thinking like a fucking lunatic!This isn’t just about getting Victor back. It’s about your well-being and your baby’s future. You’re a mess right now, and the last thing you need is to add more emotional turmoil.”“I can’t just give up,” Racheal said, her voice breaking. “I can’t let him think he can just walk away and not have any consequences.”Chloe took a deep breath, trying to calm her racing thoughts. “Okay, fine. If you’re set on doing this, at least promise me you’ll be careful. Don’t go in there with expectations that he’ll magically come back or that everything will be okay. You need to protect yourself. But I promise you if you come here crying and hurt I'll tell you I told you so.”Racheal nodded, tears spilling down her cheeks. “I will. I just need to know that I tried. I can’t move on without knowing that I did everything possible.”Chloe’s face softened, though her frustration lingered. “Alright. But you need to be prepared for the possibility that this could end badly. Don’t let your hope blind you to the reality of the situation.”Racheal swallowed hard, her gaze resolute. “I understand. I just… I need to do this. I can’t move forward without trying.”“Let me go get my bag upstairs and put on some makeup. I need to look really good for him,” Racheal said, her voice laced with a flicker of excitement as she hurriedly wiped her tears and dashed up the stairs, nearly stumbling on her way.“Careful!” Chloe shouted, her concern evident as she watched Racheal’s reckless ascent. Her mind was racing, trying to keep up with the whirlwind of emotions and decisions Racheal was making. “Slow down!”Chloe paced around the kitchen, her frustration palpable. What had happened to her friend? This wasn’t the Racheal she knew—this was someone caught in a delusional fantasy. Chloe shook her head, trying to make sense of the situation. “What on earth is going on with her?” she muttered to herself. “Who goes back to their vomit like this? Didn't she recall the number of nights she cried? She’s acting like she’s in some twisted fairytale.”Chloe took a deep breath, trying to steady her nerves. “Okay, Chloe, think. She’s clearly not thinking straight. You need to be there for her, even if she’s not making the best choices right now.”She grabbed her phone and dialed a number, hoping to get some perspective. “Hey, Emily? It’s Chloe. I need to talk to you about Racheal. She’s really lost it this time. Can you come over?”As she waited for Emily’s response, Chloe glanced at the staircase, her mind a whirlwind of concern and helplessness. She knew she couldn’t let Racheal face this situation alone, especially not in the state she was in. Chloe shook her head in disbelief, her frustration boiling over. “This woman is really gone,” she muttered under her breath.The situation was beyond frustrating; it was heartbreaking. Her friend, who had always been so strong, was now lost in a fantasy world where returning to Victor seemed like a feasible solution.Chapter 4 Crumbling CourageAs Racheal stepped out of the taxi, her heart pounded in her chest. She stood in front of Victor’s apartment complex, hesitating for a moment.The building looked the same as it always had, but today it felt different, more imposing. She took a deep breath, clutching her purse tightly as if it would somehow give her the courage she needed. This was it. She needed to do this, for her baby, for herself.With shaky hands, she made her way inside, climbing the stairs she once knew so well.Each step felt heavier than the last, memories flooding back of times she and Victor had spent together—times she desperately wanted to forget but couldn’t.She reached the apartment door and paused, hearing faint laughter from inside. She knocked, her knuckles tapping lightly at first, then louder as her nerves grew.The door swung open, and there stood Victor, his expression shifting from surprise to something colder when he saw her. Before she could speak, her eyes darted around the room, landing on Evelyn, whose face twisted into a scowl.“What the hell are you doing here?” Evelyn snapped, her voice laced with hostility. She stood from the couch, her hand resting protectively on her baby bump—a bump that mirrored Racheal’s own.Racheal’s breath caught in her throat as her gaze fell to Evelyn’s stomach. She was pregnant too. Of course, she was. Racheal felt a pang of jealousy and despair, knowing they were both carrying Victor’s children, but only one of them was wanted here.Victor stepped forward, blocking Racheal’s view of Evelyn. “Racheal, you shouldn’t have come,” he said flatly, his tone devoid of any warmth or familiarity.Racheal swallowed hard, trying to find her voice. “I just… I needed to talk to you. About the baby. About us.”“There is no ‘us,’ Racheal,” Victor said, his words cutting like a knife. “We’re done. I told you that.”Evelyn’s parents were sitting on the other side of the room, watching the scene unfold with disapproving eyes.Evelyn’s mother, who had once treated Racheal like a daughter, now looked at her like she was an intruder. Racheal felt their judgment, their silent accusations, and it stung.Evelyn folded her arms, her eyes narrowing. “You can’t just show up here and think you can mess things up for us. Victor has moved on, and so should you.”Racheal’s eyes welled with tears, but she blinked them away, trying to keep her composure. “I didn’t come here to mess things up. I just… I thought Victor should know about what’s going on. The doctor said—”Victor cut her off, his voice rising. “I don’t care what the doctor said, Racheal. This isn’t my problem anymore. You need to take care of your own mess.”Racheal’s lip trembled as she tried to hold back the flood of emotions. She glanced at Evelyn, who smirked, enjoying every second of Racheal’s humiliation.“You’ve got some nerve showing up here, playing the victim,” Evelyn said, her voice dripping with contempt. “Victor is with me now. We’re starting our family. You need to let go.”“You Know what, you're really pathetic, aren’t you, Racheal?” Evelyn sneered, her voice dripping with venom. “Coming here, begging like a stray dog.“ You think showing up with your sob story will change anything? Newsflash: Victor doesn’t want you. He never did. He was just too nice to tell you that he was using you.”Racheal felt the sting of Evelyn’s words like a slap to the face, but she clenched her fists, trying to stand her ground. “I’m not here to beg,” she said, her voice trembling. “I just wanted Victor to know—”“To know what?” Evelyn cut her off, her voice rising as she stepped closer. “Are you desperate? That you can’t handle the fact that he moved on? Look at you. You’re a joke, Racheal. You don’t belong here.”Evelyn’s mother, who had been watching with cold, calculating eyes, finally spoke up. She rose from her seat, her expression twisted with disdain.“I never understood what Victor saw in you,” she spat, her tone icy. “You’re nothing but a gold-digging tramp. I warned him about you from the beginning, but he was too blind to see it. Now you come here, parading that bastard child, trying to worm your way back into his life. Disgusting.”Racheal’s cheeks flushed red with humiliation, but before she could respond, Evelyn’s mother stepped forward, pointing an accusing finger in her face.“You should be ashamed of yourself, Racheal. Have you no dignity? No self-respect? You’re an embarrassment to yourself and to everyone around you.”Racheal staggered back, her mind racing with a mix of anger and heartbreak. She hadn’t expected kindness, but this? It was brutal. “I’m not here to cause trouble,” she managed to choke out, her voice breaking.Evelyn scoffed and shoved Racheal, hard. “Cause trouble? You are the trouble! You’re nothing but a leech, sucking the life out of everyone around you. Do us all a favor and crawl back into whatever hole you came from.”Racheal stumbled, her foot catching the edge of the carpet. She tried to regain her balance, but Evelyn’s mother pushed her roughly, her hands shoving Racheal back with unexpected force.“You just don’t know when to quit, do you?” Evelyn’s mother snarled. “Get out of here, you filthy little tramp!”Racheal’s feet slipped from under her, and before she could react, she went crashing down onto the hard floor, her belly taking the brunt of the fall.Pain shot through her stomach, sharp and immediate, and she gasped, clutching her bump as she tried to catch her breath. Tears streamed down her cheeks, not just from the pain but from the sheer cruelty of it all.Victor stood frozen, watching without lifting a finger to help. He just stared, his expression blank, as if she were nothing more than a nuisance—a problem he wished would disappear. Evelyn let out a mocking laugh, her voice shrill and cruel.“Look at you, on the floor where you belong,” Evelyn taunted, her voice cutting through Racheal’s pain like a knife. “Crawling around like the trash you are. I told you to get out, but you just don’t listen, do you?”Racheal struggled to push herself up, her entire body trembling. She cradled her belly, fear and panic surging through her. She didn’t know if her baby was okay, but the pain was unbearable. As she tried to stand, Evelyn’s foot shot out, kicking her back down.“You’re pathetic,” Evelyn said, towering over her. “No one wants you, Racheal. Not Victor, not your baby. You’re just a mistake. A burden.”Evelyn’s mother crossed her arms, looking down at Racheal as if she were dirt beneath her shoe. “You should have known better than to come here, Racheal. You’re nothing. You’ll always be nothing.”Racheal finally managed to get to her knees, her entire body aching. She looked up at Victor, silently begging for any sign of concern, but he just turned away, cold and distant. “I told you to leave,” he said, his voice flat. “Don’t make me say it again.”With every ounce of strength she had left, Racheal pulled herself up, biting back the sobs that threatened to escape. She was humiliated, hurt, and terrified, but she forced herself to hold her head high, even as her vision blurred with tears.“You’ll regret this, Victor,” she said, her voice hoarse but defiant. “All of you will.”And with that, she turned and stumbled out of the apartment, clutching her belly and praying that her baby would be okay.As she limped down the stairs, Evelyn’s laughter echoed in her ears, mocking her, taunting her. But Racheal didn’t look back. She couldn’t afford to. She had to keep moving forward, no matter how broken she felt inside.As Rachel went back home, she knew Chloe would either laugh at her or say, “I warned you.” The thought made her stomach churn.Chloe had been right all along, and Rachel hated how her friend’s warnings always seemed to come true. She could already imagine Chloe's smirk, the way she'd toss her hair and lean against the doorframe, arms crossed with that annoyingly knowing look.Rachel sighed, her grip tightening around the strap of her bag. “I told you so,” she could almost hear Chloe's voice echoing in her mind, playful yet laced with genuine concern.As much as she dreaded the teasing, Rachel knew Chloe’s words came from a place of love. It was the thought of facing her friend’s mockery that stung the most. Because deep down, Rachel wasn’t ready to admit that she had messed up—again.\*\*\*\*\*Rachel pushed open Chloe’s front door, dragging her feet as she stepped inside. Chloe was sprawled out on the couch, surrounded by snacks and an open laptop, binge-watching her favorite show.The moment she saw Rachel’s defeated expression, Chloe’s lips curled into a grin, unable to resist the urge to tease her.“Oh, my God,” Chloe burst into laughter, clapping her hands. “Don’t even say it. I knew it! I told you so, didn’t I?” She leaned back, still chuckling, enjoying her moment of being right. “I warned you, Rachel. But no, you just had to see for yourself.”Rachel tried to force a smile, but it crumbled under the weight of Chloe’s laughter.The sting of being wrong, of ignoring Chloe’s advice, hit her all at once. Tears welled in her eyes, and before she could stop herself, she broke down, sobbing uncontrollably. She covered her face, her whole body shaking as she sank onto the nearest chair.The sound of Rachel’s crying snapped Chloe out of her playful mood. Her laughter died instantly, replaced by concern.She jumped up, rushing over to her friend. “Oh, no, Rach…” Chloe murmured, guilt washing over her as she saw the tears streaming down Rachel’s cheeks. She hadn’t meant to hurt her like this.Without hesitation, Chloe pulled Rachel into a tight embrace, holding her close. “I’m so sorry,” she whispered, her voice thick with remorse. “I didn’t mean it like that. I’m just... I’m just worried about you.” Chloe stroked Rachel’s hair, rocking her gently as Rachel sobbed into her shoulder.Rachel clung to her, letting the tears fall freely. Chloe’s warmth and the soft murmur of her apologies eased some of the pain. Chloe tightened her grip, her voice softening. “I’m here, okay? I’ve got you.”They stayed like that, wrapped up in each other, until Rachel’s sobs quieted. Chloe held her a little tighter, making sure Rachel knew that no matter what, she would always be there to catch her when she fell. As Racheal hugged her friend she silently vowed that this was the last straw. She would make them pay!

They mocked her for being nothing—now they bow to the name she was born to own.
Reading this quietly… let me know if you’re looking"," Broken Promises Rachael rushed home, barely able to contain her excitement. The bright lines on the pregnancy test still seemed surreal. After years of trying, endless doctor visits, and nights spent crying in Victor’s arms, it was finally happening. She couldn’t wait to see his face when she told him. Today was the start of their happily ever after.She pulled into the driveway, her mind buzzing with a thousand thoughts of their future. Their baby. She clutched her purse tightly, the test still inside, and hurried into the house.But as soon as she stepped through the door, something felt wrong. The living room was in disarray—cushions tossed about, a wine glass half-empty on the coffee table, and clothes scattered like someone had rushed out of them.Rachael’s heart skipped a beat as she spotted the unfamiliar lingerie draped over the couch. She touched the lacy fabric, her fingers trembling. Panic set in. She blinked rapidly, trying to force a logical explanation into her mind. Maybe Victor’s sister was here, or—no, that didn’t make sense. Deep down, she knew.She dropped the lingerie, her breathing shallow and quick, and followed the trail of discarded clothes down the hall. The closer she got to the bedroom, the louder the muffled sounds became—moans and gasps, unmistakable and raw. Rachael’s vision blurred, her legs heavy like lead. She grabbed the doorframe, steadying herself. Every instinct screamed at her to turn back, to not look, but she pushed the door open.There, tangled in sheets and each other, were Victor and Evelyn. The sight hit Rachael like a punch to the gut, knocking the breath out of her. Her husband and her sister. The betrayal was overwhelming, a tidal wave crashing down, pulling her under.The pregnancy test slipped from her grasp, hitting the floor with a soft thud that went unnoticed. “What the hell is this?” Rachael’s voice cracked, half shriek, half sob. She felt as though she’d stepped into a nightmare she couldn’t wake up from. “Victor, Evelyn, what is this?”Victor scrambled off the bed, fumbling to cover himself. “Rachael, this isn’t—”But Evelyn didn’t even flinch. Instead, she smiled with a cold satisfaction that sent chills down Rachael’s spine. “Don’t look so shocked, Rachael,” she drawled. “Did you really think you deserved him? Pathetic.”Rachael’s vision blurred with tears. She turned to Victor, searching for any sign of regret, a hint that this was some terrible mistake. “Victor, after everything we’ve been through, after all we’ve done to build this life... How could you?” Her voice wavered, each word dripping with the pain of betrayal.Victor pulled on his shirt, avoiding her gaze, his face twisted in a mixture of guilt and frustration. “It’s not what you think, Rachael,” he started, but the weak excuse hung in the air like a bad joke.“Not what I think?” Rachael repeated, her voice rising in pitch as anger began to replace her shock. “You’re in bed with my sister! How many times has this happened? How long have you been lying to me?”Evelyn rolled her eyes, sitting up with deliberate slowness, as if savoring the moment. “Victor and I have been together for months. He’s tired of you, Rachael. Tired of your whining, your failures, your pathetic attempts to keep him interested.” She glanced at the pregnancy test lying on the floor, her lip curling. “And I’m guessing that didn’t go the way you hoped either.”Rachael’s heart clenched, her hand instinctively covering her abdomen as if trying to protect the fragile hope inside her. “You don’t know anything about me,” she spat, tears threatening to spill. “You’re nothing but a snake. Both of you.”Victor stepped forward, reaching for her, but Rachael jerked back, holding up a hand to keep him at a distance. “Don’t touch me,” she hissed. “I can’t believe I ever loved you. Either of you.”Evelyn’s mocking laughter filled the room, echoing in Rachael’s ears. “You’re so dramatic, Rachael. Victor doesn’t need your love. He needs someone who can give him what he wants. And that’s never been you.”Rachael’s fingers clenched into fists, the sting of Evelyn’s words hitting deeper than she wanted to admit. She turned to Victor one last time, her voice low and trembling. “I gave you everything, Victor. My heart, my trust, my years. And you threw it all away for... this?”Victor’s silence spoke louder than any excuse he could muster. His eyes darted away, shame flickering briefly before settling into a cold, detached expression. “Maybe it’s best if you just leave,” he said finally, his voice devoid of emotion. “Evelyn and I... we’re together now. And you... you deserve better than this.”Rachael stared at him, the weight of his words crushing her. There it was—the final nail in the coffin of her marriage, driven in by the man she had once thought she’d spend her life with. She backed away, her legs shaking, but she held her head high, refusing to let either of them see her break.“I hope you both rot,” she said quietly, her voice steady despite the tears burning her eyes. She turned and walked out, leaving the shattered remains of her dreams behind.Rachael slammed the door shut and started the car, her hands shaking as she gripped the steering wheel. She had no destination in mind; she just needed to get away.Away from the house that now felt like a graveyard of broken promises, away from the suffocating betrayal that threatened to choke her. The city blurred around her, the streetlights flickering past as she drove with no sense of direction, fueled only by anger and heartbreak.Her phone buzzed on the passenger seat, Victor’s name lighting up the screen. Rachael hesitated for a moment, the bile rising in her throat. She didn’t want to hear his voice, but curiosity—and fury—got the better of her. She snatched the phone and answered, her tone laced with venom. “What do you want!”Victor’s voice came through, cold and devoid of any remorse. “Rachael, I’ve instructed my lawyer to send over the divorce papers. Sign them. It’s over.”The casual finality of his words sent a fresh wave of rage through her. “You think you can just send me a piece of paper and that’s it? We’re done? After everything you put me through? You’re a pathetic, spineless coward, Victor.”Victor sighed, sounding more annoyed than guilty. “Rachael, let’s not make this harder than it needs to be. Evelyn and I are moving forward, and you should too.”“Moving forward?” Rachael’s voice rose, her anger spilling over. “You mean crawling into bed with my sister like the shameless, gutless bastard you are? You have no idea what loyalty or love means. You disgust me, Victor. You’re not a man—you’re a joke. A pathetic excuse of a husband who can’t even keep his pants zipped.”Victor’s tone hardened, defensive, “At least she fucks me and satisfies me better than you, bitch!” Victor yelled, his words slicing through the phone like a jagged knife. Rachael gasped, the wind knocked out of her as if she’d been punched. She clutched her chest, the pain spreading like wildfire—rage, disbelief, and heartbreak all mingling together.For a moment, she was stunned into silence, the venom in his voice lingering in her ears. But then the shock faded, replaced by a burning fury that surged through her veins. She wasn’t going to let him have the last word. Not like this.“Take that back, you good-for-nothing excuse of a man!” Rachael’s voice quivered, her anger bubbling over. “You think that pathetic insult means anything coming from you? You’re nothing, Victor! A spineless, worthless coward who can’t handle a real woman, so you settle for scraps. I gave you everything, and you threw it away for someone who’s just as cheap and hollow as you are!”Victor’s silence only fueled her fire. “You think Evelyn’s some prize? She’s a two-faced, backstabbing bitch, and you’re too blind to see you’re just her latest game. She’ll chew you up and spit you out when she’s done, just like she’s done with every other idiot who’s fallen for her act. You’re not special, Victor—you’re a fool. A damn fool who doesn’t even realize he’s lost the best thing he ever had.”Victor scoffed, but Rachael cut him off before he could speak. “You know what? I pity you. I pity you for thinking that sneaking around and betraying the one person who actually gave a damn about you makes you some kind of man. But you’re not a man.“ You’re a pathetic, insecure little boy who can’t stand the sight of himself in the mirror. And one day, when Evelyn’s done using you, when you’re alone and drowning in your own self-loathing, you’ll remember this moment. You’ll remember that you lost me because you were too stupid to see what you had.”She paused, breathing heavily, her chest heaving with every word. “So enjoy your trash, Victor. Enjoy every miserable second of the life you’ve chosen because you and Evelyn are a perfect match—two worthless, miserable souls destined to destroy each other. And when you come crawling back, begging for forgiveness, remember this: you are nothing to me. Nothing. And you never will be again.”With that, she ended the call, throwing the phone onto the seat beside her. Rachael’s hands were still shaking, but she felt lighter, freer. Victor’s words had stung, but her own felt like a release, a purging of all the anger and hurt she’d carried for so long.She wasn’t going to let Victor’s insults define her. She was going to rise above this, stronger than ever. And Victor? He could wallow in the mess he’d made of his life.Because Rachael was done with him. For good.Chapter 2 Breaking PointRacheal sank into her couch, her hands mindlessly reaching for the array of junk food scattered on the coffee table. Tears streamed down her cheeks, mixing with the saltiness of the chips she stuffed into her mouth.It had been a month since everything fell apart, and though she put on a brave face for the world, the cracks were deep, and her pain felt endless.Each day blurred into the next, filled with crying, overeating, and self-loathing. She had gained weight rapidly, her once healthy glow fading as she neglected herself, forgetting about the tiny heartbeat that depended on her.The sound of the front door opening snapped her out of her daze. Chloe, her best friend, walked in, her face brightening with a warm smile that quickly faded when she saw Racheal.There she was, slouched on the couch, her swollen eyes red from crying, her hair in disarray, and surrounded by empty wrappers. She looked like a broken shell of the vibrant woman Chloe once knew.""Racheal,"" Chloe said, her voice tinged with concern. ""You look like a sad potato left out in the sun too long."" She tried to make light of it, but her heart broke seeing her friend like this. ""Come on, babe. You can’t keep doing this to yourself.""Racheal sniffed, wiping her tears with the back of her hand. “I don’t know how to stop, Chloe. Everything just... hurts.”“It’s been a month, girl!” Chloe's voice rose, frustration edging her words as she tossed her bag onto the chair. “You’re still crying over that douchebag? He’s not worth it!”Racheal’s sobs intensified, her shoulders shaking with every breath. “I don’t know what to do anymore, Chloe!” she wailed, her voice cracking.“I have a child growing inside me, and there’s no father. It’s all too much.” She choked on her own words, tears mixing with snot as she messily wiped her face with the back of her hand. “I don’t know how to be strong for this baby when I feel so weak.”Chloe’s heart clenched at the sight of her best friend falling apart. She moved closer, gripping Racheal’s shoulders firmly, pulling her into a gentle embrace.“There, there, it’s okay, baby,” Chloe whispered, her voice soothing as she stroked Racheal’s hair, trying to comfort her through her own pain. She hated seeing Racheal like this—defeated, lost, and drowning in a sea of despair.But Racheal’s mind was still trapped, unable to accept the harsh reality of her situation. She hadn’t come to terms with Victor leaving, her thoughts clinging to the faint hope that maybe, just maybe, it was all a bad dream she’d eventually wake up from.She still half-expected to hear his keys jingling at the door, his voice filling the empty rooms. A delusional fantasy that she couldn’t shake, even though Victor had made his choice loud and clear—he was gone, and he wasn’t coming back.“You’re not alone in this,” Chloe murmured, holding Racheal tighter. “I know it feels like the end, but it’s not. We’re going to figure this out. You’re stronger than you think, and you don’t need him to be a great mom. We’ll get through this together.”After helping Racheal calm down, Chloe brushed her friend’s messy hair out of her face, trying to restore a sense of normalcy. “Come on,” Chloe said gently, standing up and offering her hand. “Let’s go to the kitchen. Help me whip up something good. It’ll take your mind off things.”Racheal hesitated but eventually took Chloe’s hand, letting her friend guide her to the kitchen. It was a small gesture, but Chloe knew that keeping Racheal busy, even for a few minutes, was better than letting her spiral deeper into her grief.Since the divorce, Chloe had been the only one taking care of her, practically moving in to ensure Racheal wasn’t completely alone with her thoughts. Chloe had become the sister Racheal always wished Evelyn could be, someone who actually cared.As they shuffled around the kitchen, Chloe’s eyes flicked to Racheal’s vacant stare. It was more than just heartbreak—there was a lifetime of hurt simmering beneath the surface. Racheal was an orphan, adopted by Evelyn’s parents when she was just a child. She had always tried to be good to but instead they treated her like trash.Chloe watched Racheal’s pained expression as she chopped the vegetables, her movements robotic and disconnected.It broke Chloe’s heart to see her best friend so lost, and she wished she could take the pain away, even if just for a moment. Chloe continued stirring the pot, her mind racing with ways to help Racheal rebuild, to remind her of the strong, resilient woman she used to be.“You know,” Chloe began, trying to keep her tone light, “we should do something fun, just us girls. A weekend getaway or even just a spa day. You need a break, Racheal. A real one.”Racheal gave a half-hearted smile, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “I don’t know, Chloe. I feel so... heavy. I can’t pretend to be okay when I’m not. Everywhere I turn, it’s like there’s a ghost of what I lost.”Chloe set the spoon down, wiping her hands on a dish towel as she walked over to Racheal. She took the knife from her friend’s trembling hands and pulled her into a tight hug. “You don’t have to be okay right now. But you have to keep moving, for yourself and for your baby. You are not defined by the people who hurt you.”Racheal leaned into the embrace, her eyes stinging with fresh tears. Chloe’s warmth was the only thing holding her together. “I just... I don’t know how to be anything other than this mess, Chloe. I thought I had everything figured out. I thought Victor and I would be together forever. But Evelyn—” Her voice wavered, anger mingling with the hurt. “She took everything from me. And now I’m just... empty.”Chloe pulled back slightly, cupping Racheal’s face in her hands. “Evelyn didn’t take everything. You still have yourself, and you still have me. You have your baby. And that’s a start.”Racheal was about to say something, her lips parting to speak, when the television suddenly blared with breaking news. Both women’s heads turned to the screen, where a flashy headline in bold, all-capital letters demanded their attention:“BILLIONAIRE VICTOR SEEN WITH EVELYN BLACKWOOD, SPORTING A BABY BUMP WHILE SHOPPING FOR BABY CLOTHES. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? IS VICTOR THE FATHER OF EVELYN’S BABY? AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS OTHER WIFE? STAY TUNED.”The words hit Racheal like a punch to the gut. She froze, her breath hitching as images of Victor and Evelyn filled the screen. There they were, smiling and looking every bit the happy couple as they strolled through the baby store, Evelyn’s swollen belly unmistakable. Victor’s hand rested protectively on her back, his face lit up with the same joy Racheal had once seen when he looked at her.Racheal’s vision blurred as tears welled up, the room spinning around her. It felt like she was watching her worst nightmare unfold in real time. The man who had vowed to love her, who she had once believed was her forever, was now flaunting his new life with the very person who had ripped her world apart.Chloe quickly grabbed the remote, fumbling to mute the TV, but it was too late. The damage was done. Racheal staggered back, her legs weak beneath her, and she clutched the counter for support. “No...” she whispered, her voice breaking as the tears she’d been holding back spilled over. “No, no, no. This can’t be happeningRacheal’s knees buckled, and she collapsed onto the kitchen floor, her hands clutching her chest as though she could physically hold her heart together. “I can't believe this! What! What the fuck!,” she repeated louder.She rocked back and forth, the disbelief twisting her insides. Each image of Victor and Evelyn together was like salt on an open wound, raw and unrelenting.Chloe dropped to her knees beside her, her heart breaking for her friend. “Racheal, listen to me,” she pleaded, holding Racheal’s trembling hands. “You have to breathe. Don’t let them destroy you. They aren’t worth this.”But Racheal couldn’t hear her. The weight of the betrayal was crushing her, pulling her under. Every dream she’d ever had—the white picket fence, the family, the life she’d built in her mind—was gone. All she could see was Evelyn, glowing and happy, living the life that should have been hers.“How could he do this to me?” Racheal sobbed, her tears flowing freely. “I gave him everything, Chloe. I was his wife. I loved him. And now… now he’s having a baby with her.” Her voice broke, and she buried her face in her hands, her shoulders shaking with the force of her grief.Chloe wrapped her arms around Racheal, her own eyes stinging with tears she refused to shed. “You are so much more than this moment,” she whispered fiercely. “I know it doesn’t feel like it now, but you will get through this. Victor is nothing but a liar, and Evelyn… she’s not worth your tears.”Racheal pulled away, wiping her face with the back of her hand, but the tears wouldn’t stop. “Why wasn’t I enough? Why did he choose her?” The questions spilled out, the doubts and fears she had buried since the divorce now laid bare. It wasn’t just anger; it was the deep, soul-crushing pain of not feeling worthy, of being discarded like she was nothing.Chloe shook her head, her grip tightening on Racheal’s arms. “This isn’t about you, Racheal. This is about them. They’re broken, selfish people, and they don’t deserve you. You are enough, more than enough, and one day, you’ll see that.”Racheal nodded, trying to muster the strength Chloe saw in her, but every breath felt like dragging her lungs through broken glass. Her vision blurred as the weight of everything pressed down on her chest, tighter and tighter. The room felt smaller, the air thinner, and she couldn’t shake the feeling of being trapped, suffocated by her own pain.Chloe’s voice seemed distant, her words a muffled echo that barely reached Racheal’s ears. “One step at a time,” Chloe repeated, her face full of concern. “We’ll get through this together.”But Racheal couldn’t respond. Her head was spinning, the edges of her vision darkening. She tried to stand, to shake off the dizziness, but her legs wobbled beneath her. She reached out, gripping the edge of the counter for support, but her fingers slipped, weak and trembling.“Racheal?” Chloe’s voice broke through, sharp with alarm. She stepped closer, watching as Racheal’s face drained of color. “Hey, are you okay? Racheal!”Racheal’s world tilted, and before she could process what was happening, her knees buckled. She collapsed, her body crumpling to the floor in a lifeless heap. The last thing she heard was Chloe’s frantic scream, her name echoing through the house as everything went black.Chapter 3 Desperate MeasuresAs Racheal lay unconscious on the kitchen floor, Chloe’s panic transformed into urgent action. She grabbed her phone with trembling hands and dialed the number for a local doctor.“Dr. Harper? This is Chloe Wright. My friend, Racheal—she’s collapsed. Please, we need help right away!” Her voice was a desperate rush, her heart pounding as she awaited the response.Within minutes, the doorbell rang. Chloe hurried to answer, admitting Dr. Harper, a calm and experienced physician. He quickly assessed Racheal’s condition, checking her pulse and examining her vital signs with practiced efficiency.“Chloe, can you give me a moment alone with Racheal?” Dr. Harper asked, his voice steady and reassuring.Chloe nodded, stepping aside but remaining close enough to hear. The doctor’s face was set in a serious expression as he worked, occasionally glancing at his medical bag and then back at Racheal.After a thorough examination, Dr. Harper stood up, looking concerned. “Racheal’s vital signs are stable now, but she’s under a lot of stress. I need to speak with her husband about her condition and the stress she’s been under. It’s crucial for her well-being.”Chloe’s eyes widened. “Her husband? Victor is... he’s not around anymore. He left her.”Dr. Harper looked puzzled, then reconsidered. “I see. Well, I’ll need to speak with someone close to her—maybe a family member or someone who can provide more context about her situation. It’s important to address the stressors affecting her health.”As Chloe absorbed the doctor’s words, Racheal began to stir, her eyes fluttering open. She slowly became aware of her surroundings, her gaze focusing on Chloe and the unfamiliar face of Dr. Harper.“What... happened?” Racheal mumbled, her voice weak.“You collapsed, Racheal,” Chloe explained gently. “Dr. Harper is here to help.”Racheal’s confusion cleared as she saw the concern etched on Chloe’s face. “Victor,” she whispered. “Did he—”“No, Victor isn’t here,” Chloe said firmly. “But we’ll get you the help you need. Dr. Harper, do you think there’s a way to help her through this without...?”Dr. Harper nodded. “We’ll start with what we can do here and ensure she’s stable. If there’s anyone else who can provide support or insight into her situation, it would be helpful.”After Dr Harper finished his examination and gave Racheal a serious look. “There are several tests that need to be carried out, and they require a significant amount of money. When you’re ready, you can come to the office to get the tests started. Take care of yourself, Miss. Have a good day.”With that, Dr. Harper packed his medical bag and left. Chloe watched him go, her mind racing with concern for her friend.Racheal, still disoriented but determined, pushed herself up from the floor. She looked at Chloe with a mix of desperation and resolve. “This is the call to get Victor back. I need to go to the apartment and tell him what the doctor said. Maybe he’ll come back if he knows how serious this is.”Chloe stared at her, disbelief etched on her face. “Racheal, are you kidding me? Victor’s left you. He’s with Evelyn now. You can’t just waltz back into his life and expect him to magically return.”Chloe’s frustration erupted as she paced the kitchen, her voice sharp. “Racheal, are you out of your mind? You seriously think that going back to Victor is going to fix anything? He’s moved on, and you’re still here, wallowing in this pit of despair. Are you fuvking stupid! Get over it! ”Racheal looked up, her face pale and tear-streaked. “Chloe, I just— I need to try. The doctor said the father needs to be involved. I can’t just sit here and do nothing.”“Try?” Chloe snapped, her hands on her hips. “Try what? Getting your heart broken again? You’ve been through hell already, and now you want to walk back into the fire?”“I know it sounds crazy,” Racheal said, her voice trembling. “But if there’s even a chance that Victor could come back, I have to take it. I can’t just sit here and wait for things to get worse.”Chloe’s face reddened with frustration. “You’re not thinking clearly, Racheal! This isn’t just about you anymore. You have a baby to think about. Do you really want to put yourself through more pain and risk your health for someone who clearly doesn’t care?”“I’m not doing this for me,” Racheal said firmly. “I’m doing this for my baby. The doctor said the father needs to be involved for tests, and I need to make sure everything’s alright.”Chloe threw her hands up in exasperation. “For tests? Is that what you’re focusing on right now? The fact that you’re trying to drag Victor back into your life, only to be potentially hurt again, is insane! What if he rejects you outright? What if he refuses to help with the baby?”“I have to try!” Racheal insisted, her eyes pleading. “I can’t just let him get away with everything. I need him to know what’s at stake.”Chloe’s anger was palpable as she breathed harder, her voice rising. “You’re going to lose yourself trying to fight for someone who’s already made his choice. What happens when he turns you away? You’ll be right back where you started, only now you’ll be even more broken! Use your brains Racheal! Stop being a desperate bitch! There are lots of dicks out there! Forget about him, girl!”Racheal’s face was a mask of determination mixed with anguish. “I don’t know what else to do. I feel like if I don’t try, I’ll never be able to forgive myself. I need to know that I did everything I could for our child.”Chloe’s shoulders slumped, her anger giving way to deep concern. “Racheal, you’re not thinking clearly. You need help! You're thinking like a fucking lunatic!This isn’t just about getting Victor back. It’s about your well-being and your baby’s future. You’re a mess right now, and the last thing you need is to add more emotional turmoil.”“I can’t just give up,” Racheal said, her voice breaking. “I can’t let him think he can just walk away and not have any consequences.”Chloe took a deep breath, trying to calm her racing thoughts. “Okay, fine. If you’re set on doing this, at least promise me you’ll be careful. Don’t go in there with expectations that he’ll magically come back or that everything will be okay. You need to protect yourself. But I promise you if you come here crying and hurt I'll tell you I told you so.”Racheal nodded, tears spilling down her cheeks. “I will. I just need to know that I tried. I can’t move on without knowing that I did everything possible.”Chloe’s face softened, though her frustration lingered. “Alright. But you need to be prepared for the possibility that this could end badly. Don’t let your hope blind you to the reality of the situation.”Racheal swallowed hard, her gaze resolute. “I understand. I just… I need to do this. I can’t move forward without trying.”“Let me go get my bag upstairs and put on some makeup. I need to look really good for him,” Racheal said, her voice laced with a flicker of excitement as she hurriedly wiped her tears and dashed up the stairs, nearly stumbling on her way.“Careful!” Chloe shouted, her concern evident as she watched Racheal’s reckless ascent. Her mind was racing, trying to keep up with the whirlwind of emotions and decisions Racheal was making. “Slow down!”Chloe paced around the kitchen, her frustration palpable. What had happened to her friend? This wasn’t the Racheal she knew—this was someone caught in a delusional fantasy. Chloe shook her head, trying to make sense of the situation. “What on earth is going on with her?” she muttered to herself. “Who goes back to their vomit like this? Didn't she recall the number of nights she cried? She’s acting like she’s in some twisted fairytale.”Chloe took a deep breath, trying to steady her nerves. “Okay, Chloe, think. She’s clearly not thinking straight. You need to be there for her, even if she’s not making the best choices right now.”She grabbed her phone and dialed a number, hoping to get some perspective. “Hey, Emily? It’s Chloe. I need to talk to you about Racheal. She’s really lost it this time. Can you come over?”As she waited for Emily’s response, Chloe glanced at the staircase, her mind a whirlwind of concern and helplessness. She knew she couldn’t let Racheal face this situation alone, especially not in the state she was in. Chloe shook her head in disbelief, her frustration boiling over. “This woman is really gone,” she muttered under her breath.The situation was beyond frustrating; it was heartbreaking. Her friend, who had always been so strong, was now lost in a fantasy world where returning to Victor seemed like a feasible solution.Chapter 4 Crumbling CourageAs Racheal stepped out of the taxi, her heart pounded in her chest. She stood in front of Victor’s apartment complex, hesitating for a moment.The building looked the same as it always had, but today it felt different, more imposing. She took a deep breath, clutching her purse tightly as if it would somehow give her the courage she needed. This was it. She needed to do this, for her baby, for herself.With shaky hands, she made her way inside, climbing the stairs she once knew so well.Each step felt heavier than the last, memories flooding back of times she and Victor had spent together—times she desperately wanted to forget but couldn’t.She reached the apartment door and paused, hearing faint laughter from inside. She knocked, her knuckles tapping lightly at first, then louder as her nerves grew.The door swung open, and there stood Victor, his expression shifting from surprise to something colder when he saw her. Before she could speak, her eyes darted around the room, landing on Evelyn, whose face twisted into a scowl.“What the hell are you doing here?” Evelyn snapped, her voice laced with hostility. She stood from the couch, her hand resting protectively on her baby bump—a bump that mirrored Racheal’s own.Racheal’s breath caught in her throat as her gaze fell to Evelyn’s stomach. She was pregnant too. Of course, she was. Racheal felt a pang of jealousy and despair, knowing they were both carrying Victor’s children, but only one of them was wanted here.Victor stepped forward, blocking Racheal’s view of Evelyn. “Racheal, you shouldn’t have come,” he said flatly, his tone devoid of any warmth or familiarity.Racheal swallowed hard, trying to find her voice. “I just… I needed to talk to you. About the baby. About us.”“There is no ‘us,’ Racheal,” Victor said, his words cutting like a knife. “We’re done. I told you that.”Evelyn’s parents were sitting on the other side of the room, watching the scene unfold with disapproving eyes.Evelyn’s mother, who had once treated Racheal like a daughter, now looked at her like she was an intruder. Racheal felt their judgment, their silent accusations, and it stung.Evelyn folded her arms, her eyes narrowing. “You can’t just show up here and think you can mess things up for us. Victor has moved on, and so should you.”Racheal’s eyes welled with tears, but she blinked them away, trying to keep her composure. “I didn’t come here to mess things up. I just… I thought Victor should know about what’s going on. The doctor said—”Victor cut her off, his voice rising. “I don’t care what the doctor said, Racheal. This isn’t my problem anymore. You need to take care of your own mess.”Racheal’s lip trembled as she tried to hold back the flood of emotions. She glanced at Evelyn, who smirked, enjoying every second of Racheal’s humiliation.“You’ve got some nerve showing up here, playing the victim,” Evelyn said, her voice dripping with contempt. “Victor is with me now. We’re starting our family. You need to let go.”“You Know what, you're really pathetic, aren’t you, Racheal?” Evelyn sneered, her voice dripping with venom. “Coming here, begging like a stray dog.“ You think showing up with your sob story will change anything? Newsflash: Victor doesn’t want you. He never did. He was just too nice to tell you that he was using you.”Racheal felt the sting of Evelyn’s words like a slap to the face, but she clenched her fists, trying to stand her ground. “I’m not here to beg,” she said, her voice trembling. “I just wanted Victor to know—”“To know what?” Evelyn cut her off, her voice rising as she stepped closer. “Are you desperate? That you can’t handle the fact that he moved on? Look at you. You’re a joke, Racheal. You don’t belong here.”Evelyn’s mother, who had been watching with cold, calculating eyes, finally spoke up. She rose from her seat, her expression twisted with disdain.“I never understood what Victor saw in you,” she spat, her tone icy. “You’re nothing but a gold-digging tramp. I warned him about you from the beginning, but he was too blind to see it. Now you come here, parading that bastard child, trying to worm your way back into his life. Disgusting.”Racheal’s cheeks flushed red with humiliation, but before she could respond, Evelyn’s mother stepped forward, pointing an accusing finger in her face.“You should be ashamed of yourself, Racheal. Have you no dignity? No self-respect? You’re an embarrassment to yourself and to everyone around you.”Racheal staggered back, her mind racing with a mix of anger and heartbreak. She hadn’t expected kindness, but this? It was brutal. “I’m not here to cause trouble,” she managed to choke out, her voice breaking.Evelyn scoffed and shoved Racheal, hard. “Cause trouble? You are the trouble! You’re nothing but a leech, sucking the life out of everyone around you. Do us all a favor and crawl back into whatever hole you came from.”Racheal stumbled, her foot catching the edge of the carpet. She tried to regain her balance, but Evelyn’s mother pushed her roughly, her hands shoving Racheal back with unexpected force.“You just don’t know when to quit, do you?” Evelyn’s mother snarled. “Get out of here, you filthy little tramp!”Racheal’s feet slipped from under her, and before she could react, she went crashing down onto the hard floor, her belly taking the brunt of the fall.Pain shot through her stomach, sharp and immediate, and she gasped, clutching her bump as she tried to catch her breath. Tears streamed down her cheeks, not just from the pain but from the sheer cruelty of it all.Victor stood frozen, watching without lifting a finger to help. He just stared, his expression blank, as if she were nothing more than a nuisance—a problem he wished would disappear. Evelyn let out a mocking laugh, her voice shrill and cruel.“Look at you, on the floor where you belong,” Evelyn taunted, her voice cutting through Racheal’s pain like a knife. “Crawling around like the trash you are. I told you to get out, but you just don’t listen, do you?”Racheal struggled to push herself up, her entire body trembling. She cradled her belly, fear and panic surging through her. She didn’t know if her baby was okay, but the pain was unbearable. As she tried to stand, Evelyn’s foot shot out, kicking her back down.“You’re pathetic,” Evelyn said, towering over her. “No one wants you, Racheal. Not Victor, not your baby. You’re just a mistake. A burden.”Evelyn’s mother crossed her arms, looking down at Racheal as if she were dirt beneath her shoe. “You should have known better than to come here, Racheal. You’re nothing. You’ll always be nothing.”Racheal finally managed to get to her knees, her entire body aching. She looked up at Victor, silently begging for any sign of concern, but he just turned away, cold and distant. “I told you to leave,” he said, his voice flat. “Don’t make me say it again.”With every ounce of strength she had left, Racheal pulled herself up, biting back the sobs that threatened to escape. She was humiliated, hurt, and terrified, but she forced herself to hold her head high, even as her vision blurred with tears.“You’ll regret this, Victor,” she said, her voice hoarse but defiant. “All of you will.”And with that, she turned and stumbled out of the apartment, clutching her belly and praying that her baby would be okay.As she limped down the stairs, Evelyn’s laughter echoed in her ears, mocking her, taunting her. But Racheal didn’t look back. She couldn’t afford to. She had to keep moving forward, no matter how broken she felt inside.As Rachel went back home, she knew Chloe would either laugh at her or say, “I warned you.” The thought made her stomach churn.Chloe had been right all along, and Rachel hated how her friend’s warnings always seemed to come true. She could already imagine Chloe's smirk, the way she'd toss her hair and lean against the doorframe, arms crossed with that annoyingly knowing look.Rachel sighed, her grip tightening around the strap of her bag. “I told you so,” she could almost hear Chloe's voice echoing in her mind, playful yet laced with genuine concern.As much as she dreaded the teasing, Rachel knew Chloe’s words came from a place of love. It was the thought of facing her friend’s mockery that stung the most. Because deep down, Rachel wasn’t ready to admit that she had messed up—again.\*\*\*\*\*Rachel pushed open Chloe’s front door, dragging her feet as she stepped inside. Chloe was sprawled out on the couch, surrounded by snacks and an open laptop, binge-watching her favorite show.The moment she saw Rachel’s defeated expression, Chloe’s lips curled into a grin, unable to resist the urge to tease her.“Oh, my God,” Chloe burst into laughter, clapping her hands. “Don’t even say it. I knew it! I told you so, didn’t I?” She leaned back, still chuckling, enjoying her moment of being right. “I warned you, Rachel. But no, you just had to see for yourself.”Rachel tried to force a smile, but it crumbled under the weight of Chloe’s laughter.The sting of being wrong, of ignoring Chloe’s advice, hit her all at once. Tears welled in her eyes, and before she could stop herself, she broke down, sobbing uncontrollably. She covered her face, her whole body shaking as she sank onto the nearest chair.The sound of Rachel’s crying snapped Chloe out of her playful mood. Her laughter died instantly, replaced by concern.She jumped up, rushing over to her friend. “Oh, no, Rach…” Chloe murmured, guilt washing over her as she saw the tears streaming down Rachel’s cheeks. She hadn’t meant to hurt her like this.Without hesitation, Chloe pulled Rachel into a tight embrace, holding her close. “I’m so sorry,” she whispered, her voice thick with remorse. “I didn’t mean it like that. I’m just... I’m just worried about you.” Chloe stroked Rachel’s hair, rocking her gently as Rachel sobbed into her shoulder.Rachel clung to her, letting the tears fall freely. Chloe’s warmth and the soft murmur of her apologies eased some of the pain. Chloe tightened her grip, her voice softening. “I’m here, okay? I’ve got you.”They stayed like that, wrapped up in each other, until Rachel’s sobs quieted. Chloe held her a little tighter, making sure Rachel knew that no matter what, she would always be there to catch her when she fell. As Racheal hugged her friend she silently vowed that this was the last straw. She would make them pay!

## FAQs Section

**How do I prevent my ball candle from tunneling?**
To prevent tunneling, ensure that the first burn allows the wax to melt completely across the entire surface of the candle. This initial ""memory burn"" establishes a consistent burn pattern for future use. Avoid short burns, as they can cause the candle to tunnel inward. Properly trim the wick to about ¼ inch before each burn to ensure a clean and even flame.

**Can I reuse the wax from a ball candle after it has burned down?**
Yes, the remaining wax from a ball candle can be reused to make new candles or wax melts. You can melt the remaining wax and add new wicks to make smaller candles in different containers. Alternatively, you can use the melted wax in a wax warmer to enjoy the remaining fragrance. Be sure to remove any wick debris before reusing the wax.

**What is the best way to clean up spilled wax from a ball candle?**
The best way to clean up spilled wax is to let it cool and harden completely. Once the wax is solid, you can gently scrape it off the surface using a plastic scraper or a credit card. For fabrics or carpets,you can place a piece of paper towel or cloth over the wax and iron it on low heat. The heat will melt the wax, allowing it to be absorbed by the paper towel. Always test a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure the heat doesn't damage the material.

Well, as soon as she arrived, the sky cleared up and the sun came out, so we decided against going to a cafe and sticking to our original plan. It was really nice. We walked in one direction for about 30 minutes before deciding to turn back around again. But then, everything happened really fast. Over a course of no more than three minutes, the sky turned to a dark grey. We managed to find some shelter under a semi-impervious bridge shortly after hell broke loose. I think for it to be called 'rain', it would have had to consist of drops. What came down from the heavens yesterday felt more like the streams coming out of a showerhead. We were wet to the bone in an instant. We stayed under that bridge for a good half of an hour, but we got cold pretty quickly, so we decided to walk home. We were wet anyways. It really felt like taking a shower with pur clothes on. Of course, the rain stopped as soon as we arrived at home. We both took a warm shower and then drank some well-deserved coffee.",1,1748951204.0,WriteStreakEN,1,1.0,False
1l29rap,https://www.reddit.com/r/EctopicSupportGroup/comments/1l29rap/ovarian_ectopic_successfully_treated_with/,"Ovarian ectopic successfully treated with methotrexate (MTX) - sharing my HCG trend, experience, and what helped me stay grounded","Hi everyone, I wanted to share my story here, not just to process what I’ve been through, but also to hopefully help someone else going through this awful, confusing time. I’m 22, student in the UK, and this whole thing was accidental, unexpected, and very scary.

How it began:

I found out I was pregnant on 9th May. I’d been spotting for a few days – brown in colour with a grainy, clotty texture, like coffee grounds – and had some mild, localised cramping on my right side. These symptoms are what initially prompted me to take the test, however, when it lasted more than 4–5 days, something in me knew it wasn’t right.

On 12th May, I went to A&E scared out of my mind, worried about rupture. That same day, I got my first HCG result: 232. I was referred to EPU, and on 13th May, they confirmed via a transvaginal scan that it was likely an ovarian ectopic on the right side.

My HCG trend and treatment path:
	•	12 May: HCG = 232
	•	14 May: HCG = 193 → later that day = 192
(I was admitted due to bleeding and cramping, which was probably around a 4/10 but manageable with a hot pack). 
	•	17 May: HCG = 205
	•	19 May: HCG = 217
At this point, although I was initially under expectant management, I started pushing for methotrexate. My gut just knew I wouldn’t be able to mentally rest until it was treated actively – and I felt stable enough to handle it. Thankfully, I received MTX on 20 May.
	•	23 May (Day 4): HCG = 72
	•	26 May (Day 7): HCG = 39
	•	2 June (Day 14): HCG = 6
→ I was discharged from outpatient the same day.

Experience on MTX:

I was not advised directly to avoid folic acid in my diet, just to stop any vitamin or folic acid supplements per the pamphlet I was given. Because UK flour is legally fortified, I switched to gluten-free toast, eggs, plain potatoes, bananas, milk, and a lot of junk food at first (because it’s often unfortified). I followed this strictly for the first 7 days, then gradually resumed a normal diet.

After the MTX shot, I felt tired and had some site pain and lightheadedness for a few hours, but honestly nothing alarming. I didn’t experience the dreaded Day 4 rise, it began dropping rapidly, and by Day 5–6, I started getting random twinges on my right side, which were scary but tolerable. No spotting after 19th May, and by Day 10, I noticed a return to my usual discharge.

Scans and clinical decisions:

I really want to stress how helpful my two transvaginal scans were, one on 13th May, and the other on 20th May (day of the shot). That second one I had to advocate for, but it gave crucial insight into the mass, checked for signs of stress, and helped confirm that rupture wasn’t imminent. Don’t rely on HCG levels alone. Scans can offer additional peace of mind and help make informed decisions.

Emotionally:

The first week (12–19 May) was the worst. Waiting, rechecking levels, and not knowing what direction things were heading. I felt incredibly helpless, and it didn’t help that people kept pushing expectant management when I knew I’d do better with methotrexate. Please trust your gut. Advocate for yourself. If you’re emotionally distressed and stable clinically, methotrexate is a valid option and has no known long-term impact on fertility or health. 

Some notes to others going through this:
	•	Please share your HCG trend, scan results, mass size, and clinical picture when posting. I’ve seen stories online that caused me panic because people mentioned rupture at HCG = 10, without mentioning other details. Everyone’s body is different, and panic doesn’t help.
	•	If you’re vegetarian or in the UK where most flour is fortified, managing diet post-MTX can feel limiting. Gluten-free toast, crisps, eggs, cheese, plain cooked veg like potatoes, milk, and non-fortified cereal helped me manage.
	•	It’s normal to feel low even after you’re discharged. The emotional dip after resolution is real, be kind to yourself. You’re not “back to normal” immediately just because the numbers say so.

I was terrified for weeks. But everything in me kept saying I’d tolerate the shot well. And I did. And now I’m recovering. Slowly. But surely. 💛

I've never done this before so the format will be a bit wonky. 

I (22f), my girlfriend or GF 19f), and our mutual friend who we'll just call MF (20m) went to had decided to check out a new cafe in town. It was a small, family owned cafe with way too many customers so we had to wait about 45 minutes for some damn service so I was a bit on edge already. 

We sat down with our drinks eventually. I was on my phone while GF and MF were talking. I forgot to ask for sugar or cream for my coffee so I simply asked MF to pass me a packet of sugar. Note that MF is 6' 0 and I'm 5'7. GF is 5'1. He grabbed the sugar packets and held them high over my head so I couldn't reach it. I was obviously pissed at that. What are we, twelve? 

GF eventually stood up and grabbed a sugar packed for me. When she tried to toss it to me, it hit me in the face and caused me to spill coffee all over my clothes and new phone. 

Anyone would yell if someone did this, right? So I yelled at her, asking her what the hell she was doing and I, though it may have been rude, asked her if she was stupid. Another thing to note is GF has past abuse trauma from her parents and ex boyfriend and is easily triggered though it was a two years ago and I think she should obviously move on as any normal, stable person would. 

After I yelled at her, she flinched and through her hands over her face and started bawling, saying something like ""please don't hit me blah blah blah"". Keep in mind I've never hit her and would never dream of hitting her. People were staring, giving me disgusted looks, even MF looked angry with me. 

After this, I decided to just go home and get a new phone which I have just finished setting up and I am now posting this on it. Me and GF live together so it was hard to avoid talking about it. We started talking about it and how it is and isn't okay for her to behave in public because what she had done made me look like I had been abusive towards her. 

It eventually turned into an argument and I was made to look like the bad guy as always and I ended up yelling at her again and, though I'm not proud of it, threw a plate at the ground. After standing there silently for a few minutes she stormed out of the house and stayed the night at her mother's. 

Yesterday, when she got back, she proposed the idea of couple's counseling because apparently we both need help. She said it wasn't just me at all and she needs to work on her issues as well. I genuinely don't see what I had to work on and I told her that she was the one with issues, not me, and she immediately went back on the idea saying it was stupid anyway and running off. 

She's been acting skittish and cowardly around me and it's REALLY pissing me off and I dont know what to do. I've been thinking it over and maybe I was in the wrong but I don't know how because it's not my fault she holds grudges. AITA?

I coughed, feeling my cock start to harden, my eyes sliding down your pretty face and mouth to the depth of your cleavage. I uncrossed my legs, pulling a small throw blanket over my lap and yawning softly. ""I am here for you...Amy"" The words ring between us, my eyes moving back to yours. I feel my eyes heavy and I stare at your beautiful face and I think about last night. It's only a split second but I re-live the moment start to finish. 



—DREAM—  



I had dropped Bryan off, telling him to not worry. I would of course always be there for his sweet wife at home. He had given me a side hug, slapped me on the back, telling me how much he was thankful for me, for taking over when he needed it most. I realized he looked a little older, his hair thinning, his eyes a bit hollow, his gait looking worse. I had nodded, my heart pounding even then.  
  
I had gotten into the car, driving at breakneck speeds to get back to my house. I expected you there, not at Bryan’s. You waiting there at the door, wearing the sexiest white summer dress, your mammoth breasts barely covered. Your dark areolae clearly visible underneath the bright fabric. You had gone braless, Leo holding your one hand, looking a little older, somewhat taller. Holding your other hand was our other son, Alex; all three of you walking towards me, their small small fingers clutching the safety of your presence.  
  
You whispered into their ear to go hug their daddy, the words so loud and clear, I turned my head, confused. I noticed that there wasn’t anyone else, just a white background, my attention to it making a clear day appear from thin air. My subconscious adding details that were missing. I looked back, wondering if Bryan was there. The daddy they were supposed to hung.  
  
The edges of my dream began to whither away into whiteness, me getting on my knees and turning back to you. You had transported, or I had sprinted, it was unclear. I was feeling a hard force collide with my chest. Little Leo, his hands wrapped around my neck and then his energetic smile as he ran back to you and then into the house. He didn’t say the words, but I heard them. I could see them, see him calling me dad, me patting his shoulder. I thought about his graduation, not his 18th, but the kindergarten one that will be next month, and how happy we will be…me, Amy, my two boys. I blink, and I am back, on my knees, my back straight. Still taller than Leo who’s appeared in front of me again.  
  
I hear him asking me if I will be better than Bryan daddy. I look at you from there, the way you were watching our other son waddle over to me, you having helped him down the first few steps of the house. Your eyes meeting mine in a loving, sweet gaze, your other hand on your belly. And I see you turn on your heel, a smirk on your face, showing me the swell of your belly. The white begins to cover everything in my sightline, fading to an angelic white light. 



—PRESENT —  


“Why don’t you just relax, and I am going to go to the bathroom. Also,” I let out a prolonged yawn, covering my mouth. “ I need to also get a coffee - do you mind if I make one?” I get up, going to the kitchen island, inspecting to see if there was any food ready to snack on, I turned back to you asking if there's any dinner plans, then go down into Bryan's man-cave in the semi-finished basement.  
  
The small bar I had constructed during one of his previous business trips was still sturdy, looking barely worn. I pulled a few bottles of wine from the cubbies behind the bar, checking the labels, deciding on a red cab sauv you had down there. On a whim, I grab a stronger scotch I had given Bryan, one which he would never grow to appreciate. I start walking up and I see an old rolling tray I had bought for Bryan, and I wish I had some flower to actually take a quick “walk”. I started hunting for any weed, but knowing how strict he was, I left disappointed.  
  
Grabbing the rolling tray and the bottle of wine and scotch, I came back up the stairs from the basement. I was about to call your name when I heard the soft voice of a different woman. I put the rolling tray down on the kitchen island, hunting the kitchen drawer for a corkscrew. I use the knife to peel off the wax over the cork, then uncork the bottle, barely making a sound. I realize shortly that you’ve fallen asleep, a woman on a TikTok repeating her review about a romance novel. I shake my head softly, thinking about your body that’s rising and falling steadily. I turn my attention back to the wine, pouring it into a decanter. I set up a couple of glasses on the coffee table in front of us, then the wine. Back at the kitchen counter, I take a glass of scotch for myself, downing the whole drink in one go. Then taking another. I need the liquid courage to get through this, you're too close. My fat cock throbbing. I hold my cock in my left hand, squeezing it through my dark blue jeans. 

  
  
I hear a barely audible snore, and I stop my hand. I take a sip, the third glass of the night, sitting down across from you. Watching your body. The fatigue of the sleepless nights is getting to me, each time I close my eyes, I remember another passing moment from a dream. This time, I think of my new favorite fantasy. I close my eyes putting the glass of scotch on my chest, sighing softly as I let the memory wash over me. My cock throbbing in need, protesting the restraint I am showing by keeping my hands on my chest. I put the glass to my lips, tilting it towards me, letting the amber liquor from the Highlands reach my tongue. I taste the smooth, refined liquid. The layers of it unfolding on my tongue. I feel my lips wet with the taste, the toffee and spiced wood flavors not being overpowered by the oak. I push my tongue past my lips, licking any of the drops and I try and slow my breathing.  
  
It starts as a memory, the details clear to me. 



— DREAM—  
  
The last dream started off with a white border, this one felt different. A chasm of darkness was surrounding the room. It was not a visible darkness, but rather a feeling. The tension felt thick as my eyes opened, my shoulders rising as I became more vigilant.  
  
I looked down at my phone, a text from Byran. I knew what it was. The news that there might be a way with artificial insemination. How did I already know? It didn’t take much to convince an old colleague of mine to help me out. The laws that we broke…I couldn’t let him know it was his fault. I sighed, opening my phone and texting you. “We need to talk.” I got a response back in seconds. “He’s not home, I am waiting for you.’  
  
I put my phone back in my pocket. I looked down, my memory had shifted, gone was my white shirt and grey chinos. I was wearing what I was wearing at your wedding. A dark blue suit, the matching tie and a tailored white shirt. I walked into the ambiguous hall, my feet following a pre-set path. It felt like it was a castle of some sort, torches instead of lights lining the walls. As I walked past it, I saw it begin to change, becoming a more modern, traditional affluent home.  
  
I step over the threshold, my eyes falling onto the bed. There you are sitting there. Your tits looking beautiful in the sexiest white lingerie I have ever seen. It’s your bridal set…or whatever I imagine it to be. I can see your dark brown nipples, pushing against the confines of that bra. Your massive breasts inviting me closer. “We shouldn’t do this…” I said softly, my voice is loud, clear, to the point. My body betrays my true intentions when I feel your gaze drop down to my cock. My thick shaft growing longer and longer down my pant leg. I step closer, each step putting me closer to you. I close the door behind me, shrug off my jacket, putting it on the back of a chair on my way towards you. I start undoing the buttons of my shirt.  
  
“I thought I would just…donate” the words are leaving me, my eyes staring at the dark nipples. Imagining them hardening as I tease them. I squeeze my cock and get on the bed. On my knees, I crawl towards you. I hear you look at my bulge, seeing it’s size closer. I hope you know it’s only this hard for you Amy. My words are repeated out loud.  
  
My barriers are falling, my eyes reaching yours. My body is moving of it’s own volition, leaning down. My fingers moving your hair out of the way of your breasts. I watch your gaze softly, seeing you look at my shoulders, then my forearms. I flex for you, still wanting to show you that I am going to be better…fuck I shut my eyes tighter, trying to forget about Bryan.  
  
I shake my head and take a deep breath. My voice comes out hoarse, then I cough twice, clearing it, my voice low and guttural. “He doesn’t know does he…he doesn’t know his wife is a slut deep down. You want me don’t you…are you wet for me pet?” I lick my lips as I lean down, inhaling the scent of your body. Your responding to me with soft whimpers. I look at my hand and I can realize why you’re not speaking. My hand has been around your throat. Squeezing your throat tighter and tighter, your eyes wide. I can see your tongue come out of your mouth, drool leaking down the side, down your cheek.  
  
You look at me and nod slowly, deliberately. Your eyes wide, my pupils as dilated as yours. I groan in pleasure in return. Squeezing your throat tighter, feeling my fingers tighten around you as your wind pipe. My hands so tight, I can see the bruise forming as I slowly allow you to breathe. My right hand on your shoulder, pulling the strap so it’s straight and not falling off your shoulder. I squeeze your breast with my hand over the bra. My thumb rolling over your nipple.  
  
“I know what you need Amy” I say your name slowly, leaning forward against your ear. I lick your earlobe softly, then grumble with pleasure, sliding my hand under your bra. I squeeze the titty flesh, my thumb running over your hard nipple for the first time. “You need to be bred don’t you pet…you need to get nice and big.” I spank your tits. My hand letting off your throat, gliding down your body. My finger tips dancing down as I start sliding your bra off your shoulders now. Your mammoth breasts are freed, my mouth latching onto the nipple and sucking.  
  
“Are your titties sensitive…I can’t wait till they get even bigger baby girl…my cum inside you…” I start rubbing your navel, making you spread your legs as I grind my bulge between your legs. The friction of my slacks on your panties. I start grinding harder, needy, my mouth open in a silent moan. I slide my hand back to your tit, holding it up so I could bite on your nipple hard. “First you’re going to feel my child…then you’re going to come over, ride my cock like you have needed to…and feed me those big fat titties slut.  
  
I groan louder, focussed on your breasts. Switching sides. Spanking them. Soon I feel your wet pussy leaking down your panties. My fingers picking up your wetness and bringing it to my mouth. In my half asleep state, my tongue pokes out, taking more of the whiskey. In my dream, I taste the sweetness…my eyes growing darker as I let go of your breast. I kiss down your belly. Stopping there, making eye contact with you. “Spread your legs for me slut…I am going to breed you right now…and I hope it doesn’t work…so you can come back home with me tonight. I would tie you up, spread eagled. Use your cunt, deposit load after load…how long would it take baby…do you want it?” I slap your tits again, harder. Now I kiss down your belly, over your wet panties. Pushing my tongue against your slit.  
  
“I can’t wait to fuck you…make you my slut…make those big titties my personal fucking fun bags” I pushed two fingers inside your cunt, my tongue lapping at your outer lips. Spending a few minutes finger fucking you, I switched my hands, instead of using my fingers to reach deep inside you, I spread your outer lips apart, I dived between your sweet pussy, licking it top to bottom, then back again. “Is your clit sensitive baby girl…” I felt your hands grab your head. Your whimpering noises turning me on. You were leaking all over my face. I kissed your outer lips again, then I began to suck on the hood of your clit. “I could live right here baby…could you imagine…fucking you with my tongue before I go to work…you riding my face while I am at work.”  
  
My fingers reach inside, teasing your walls. I search for your sensitive spots, wanting to learn about your body. I stay there for a few minutes, then I can’t take it anymore. I pull down my pants, freeing my cock. It’s soaked in my own precum. I run it up and down your slit, pushing the head against your entrance.  
  
“JAY” I hear you moan, pleading.  
  
“No…no” I shake my head.  
  
“Jake…fuck me…please’ your voice takes on the tone of a younger girl, looking like you did on your wedding day. You hold your tits up to me, your fingers rolling in your thumb and middle finger.. One hand drops between your legs and you rub the wetness against your thighs and spread your legs open wider. “Jake…fuck me…I know I am your dream MILF…so come on baby boy…make me a mommy tonight” You lick your lips, your hands wrapping around my back, pulling my face to yours. My cock lines up with your entrance again, the thick head pushing inside.  
  
“God…just the tip…Fuck…Am I…Fuck…” The questions unsaid, I want to know…I want you to tell me who’s better. I haven’t even fucked you and I can’t imagine you ever having been wetter. The puddle on your bed is growing and I grin. I take your hand from my neck, run it down my muscular body. Feeling your fingers parting my chest hair down to my cock.  
  
“You’re going to be such a hot MILF…these tits are going to be bigger…making milk for your little son won’t they. You’re going to get even more sensitive” I thrust against your hand, feeling you guide me inside you. The little hitch in your breath making me stop and then jam my cock inside you. For the next 5 minutes I hold your legs up, hooking them over my head. I fold you in half. Your tits pressing against your legs as a cushion. My cock drilling your wet pussy, your walls squeezing me tight.  
  
I close my eyes, my pleasure growing. My moans matching yours. I grunt as I look at your face. “You…fuckl…you’re going to hold your legs…keep that cum deep inside you…Good girl” I spank your tits. Over and over again, I fuck you as deep as I can. Finally your pussy contracting. My mouth crushing against yours as I cum inside you. I stay there, breathing heavily over you, not moving, not letting a single drop leak out. The darkness around the room flies down, drapes of a show closing. End Scene.   
  
—PRESENT—  
  
I felt my cock ache, the dream was vivid, the details even hotter as I made some creative license changes. My breathing had quickened, but within seconds I had calmed down. It’s surprising how fast you can grow used to this. I was in a constant state of arousal since I moved back in your vicinity. I finished the whiskey, looking at the watch. I poured two glasses of wine from the decanter. I stood in the kitchen again, grabbing some cheese and crackers and sitting down in the loveseat beside you. I slide under the blanket and where you curl up, I squeeze your thigh…fuck you’re soft. Then I do it again hard. “Time to wake up Amy” ",1,1748950768.0,u_Jay_KDD,0,1.0,False

**Summary**:

Have you ever wondered why Saiki likes coffee jelly too much? Well, that's because of a little incident when he was little.

When he was just 2 years old, one day he ate a lot, too much, and from one moment to the next he fell asleep, almost as if he was hibernating.

Here is the list baka lang makatulong sa gusto mag tingin tingin. 

\-1 Package supplier = 195k (Food \[140pax\], styling table and chair for both reception and ceremony, give away, pre-nup, coffee bar \[50pax\], Entourage flowers, bouquet, wine, grazing table \[50pax, puto, black mini kutsinta, sapin sapin, biko, photo booth 2hours. basic light and sounds with LED 9x12Monitor, invitation layout)  
\-Photo and video with SDE = 18k (tropa, pero ang rate nila 25-30k)  
\-Venue same for both Ceremony and Reception = 45k (garden wedding, resort din siya kya isang venue lang)  
\-Abay gift + wedding singer (ceremony) = 10,765k \[4pairs abay, tshirt pabango, tyka mga pang daily items like soap and shampoo\]  
\-Ninong ninang gift = 9,230 \[coffee, oatmeal,brownies \] \[4pairs\]  
\-flower girls and boys clothes = 11k \[divisoria\]  
\-Bride gown = 4951  
\-Bride prenup clothes = 5,336  
\-Reception dress = 3,898  
\-Groom clothes and abay boys = 7k (rent Gardini)  
\-Groom shoes = 4k  
\-Wedding rings = 15k (Ongpin)  
\-Wedding Singer (Reception) = 7k   


Ito yung mga possible na need consider din  
\-Transpo ng family going to venue = 10k (15pax)  
\-Venue rooms = 44k \[need kasi ng room before the wedding tyaka during\]  
\-Crew meal = 6,650 \[Ito yung food ng mga makeup artist, coordinator, photo video\]

\-Corkages = 5,000 (LED, lights)  
\-Officiant Pastor = 7k  
\-Food mismo ng morning at tanghali, nagkataon lang na biglang nagka free breakfast kami pero ang estimate namin baka mag another 5k nanaman.  
\-Woodcraft \[ito yung pwede nilang sulatan ng message\] = 5k

**Estimate total 420k**\+

Gifts nmn na bumalik is 200k+, kung siguro my babaguhin baka hindi na yung LED wall, tapos magpapaluto nlng imbes na mag crewmeal para ksama lahat.  
Tyka parang mas ok ata tlga kung morning ang problem lang is sobrang aga ng prep pero ang aga kc nun matapos, then day before palang nsa venue na mostly ng needed sa entourage, sa 4PM kc na start halos 9:30pm na natapos. Overall sobrang worth it nmn pero kung young couple ang suggestion ko siguro mag civil muna. Kami kc medyo matanda na yung parents tyka di pa nila na experience mag attend ng wedding sa mga naging anak kya pinagplanuhan tlga namin.

I'm passionate about my exams and doing academically well, solely for the validation, but she's quite the opposite and while that's not what I have an issue with, it sets up the basis for what does.

We usually go to a coffee shop after one or both of us has done an exam to study, but I'm the only one out of us doing anything and I don't know how to encourage her to do any revision. I'll be trying to revise for whatever paper we have left while she's talking about her other friends, watching Instagram reels, making her plans for the summer and generally just nothing to do with what we're studying. I remember once when I was talking about harder maths topics and just the maths exam in general, she fully interrupted me to talk about train times for what she's doing in the summer and just continued going on her phone, practically ignoring me.

I'm not her mother so obviously I'm not trying to make her revise, and I thought until today that she just preferred to study at home but just wanted to stay in the cafe for the drinks or environment, but she had an exam recently and told me that she hadn't revised at all for it, which isn't ideal at all. 

She's naturally smart so it's not like she's going to fail everything if she doesn't revise, but she has told me that she needs help in certain areas like maths, which I've tried to help her with, but I also can't teach her all of what she doesn't know because I've got stuff to study for too. 

I just don't want her to be upset on results day if she doesn't get the grades that she's hoping, but she's not really helping herself because she's putting 10% of her effort in and I know she can do so much more, and so much better, if she truly tried. The way she comes out of some of her exams furthers this, mostly because she says that it wasn't very good and isn't too happy with the exam, but if she does more revision, and subsequently better in exams, it would be a greater boost for her confidence and so would motivate her more. 

Sorry that this is so long but I really don't want to see her fail, I feel like the stress may be getting to her especially with the half term but I know that she can get all 8s and 9s if she puts more work into this. I just don't want her results day to be terrible and what she's doing now really isn't helping her. If anyone could advise me on what to do I would be eternally grateful.

# Acorn Index Update 🌳💰

**Acorn Index Value:** **$1.14**, nudging up from last week’s $1.13 (approximately +0.9%). This slight climb in Montclair’s Acorn Index – a composite gauge of local civic and economic health – suggests cautious optimism in the **“Squirrel Market.”** Montclair’s public spending plans and community investments imparted confidence, even as a few cost pressures kept local squirrels from outright exuberance. In essence, residents and businesses remain in a balanced stance – adding modestly to their acorn **hoards** (savings/investment) but mindful of not overextending in case of a **crunch**(economic strain). The steady, small uptick reflects a community that continues to believe in its economic fundamentals while watching key developments closely [open.spotify.com](https://open.spotify.com/show/58Y6YxuabdGQZSwwkpgKYs#:~:text=Montclair%27s%20Acorn%20Index%20rose%20to,that%20suggests%20confidence%20not).

* *Drivers:* Ongoing **budget progress** at Town Hall, new **community grants**, and sustained **local investment** buoyed the index. Counterbalancing these positives were **rising costs of living** and a couple of notable business closures, which injected a note of caution.

# Fiscal Policy & Town Council Developments 🏛️📝

**Municipal Budget:** Montclair’s Town Council spent the week fine-tuning the 2025 municipal budget ahead of adoption. The proposed budget stands at **$108.0 million**, carrying a **1.98% municipal tax rate increase** [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/7-things-to-know-about-montclairs-108m-town-budget-for-2025/#:~:text=The%20proposed%20spending%20plan%20introduced,home%2C%20according%20to%20the%20presentation). For the average homeowner (assessed \~$639k), this means about a $107 boost to the year’s town taxes [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/7-things-to-know-about-montclairs-108m-town-budget-for-2025/#:~:text=The%20Montclair%20Township%20Council%20has,89%2C%20Marks%20said). This modest hike – significantly lower than last year’s increase – reflects a more prudent fiscal approach, avoiding excessive use of surplus (the town’s “acorn stash”) while still funding key services [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/montclairvoyant-if-its-a-budget-we-judge-it/#:~:text=This%20brings%20me%20to%20my,Progress)[montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/montclairvoyant-if-its-a-budget-we-judge-it/#:~:text=Thank%20you%20for%20the%20comment%2C,some%20stuff%20not%20so%20much). Notably, the budget maintains Montclair’s commitment to public safety and infrastructure:

* **Police & Fire:** Police salaries are set at **$17.27M** (up 5%), and Fire at **$11.33M** (down 2% in salaries, with slight increases in other expenses)[montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/7-things-to-know-about-montclairs-108m-town-budget-for-2025/#:~:text=2,police%20and%20fire). The departments remain well-staffed (112 police, 77 fire) and even include funding for a new **Complete Streets director** to improve traffic/pedestrian safety [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/7-things-to-know-about-montclairs-108m-town-budget-for-2025/#:~:text=The%20police%20department%20is%20budgeted,complete%20streets%20director%2C%20Marks%20said).
* **Public Works:** Community Services (public works) will see a 5% salary rise (to $3.17M) and an 18% jump in other expenses (to $2.08M) – partly to address equipment upgrades and maintenance [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/7-things-to-know-about-montclairs-108m-town-budget-for-2025/#:~:text=3,public%20works). Garbage collection costs are also up 12%, reflecting higher service needs [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/7-things-to-know-about-montclairs-108m-town-budget-for-2025/#:~:text=Department%20of%20Community%20Services%2C%20or,3%20million%20is).
* **Health & Seniors:** A notable **20% increase** in the Health/Senior Services payroll is planned [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/7-things-to-know-about-montclairs-108m-town-budget-for-2025/#:~:text=4,on%20public%20health). This is largely due to expiring grants that previously subsidized staff – the township is stepping in to fund these roles to keep services running[montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/7-things-to-know-about-montclairs-108m-town-budget-for-2025/#:~:text=4,on%20public%20health). Montclair’s **Senior Center lease** ($125k) and animal shelter operations are funded as well[montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/7-things-to-know-about-montclairs-108m-town-budget-for-2025/#:~:text=Other%20expenses%20the%20health%20department,to%20%24125%2C000%2C%20the%20plan%20shows).
* **Capital Projects:** The budget earmarks **$7.48M** for capital improvements [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/7-things-to-know-about-montclairs-108m-town-budget-for-2025/#:~:text=5). Big-ticket items include **$600k to renovate Fire Station #3** (closed since 2023 and a point of intense public interest) and **$1M for a new fire Engine 1**, improving emergency response infrastructure [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/7-things-to-know-about-montclairs-108m-town-budget-for-2025/#:~:text=5). Investments in police IT ($98k), facility upgrades ($80k), and even new equipment for the **animal shelter** ($8k for computers) are in the mix [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/7-things-to-know-about-montclairs-108m-town-budget-for-2025/#:~:text=The%20budget%20shows%20%247,equipment%20at%20the%20%2049).

**Council Actions:** During this period, the Town Council held a special budget workshop on **May 28** to hear departmental presentations (Police, Fire, Health, Recreation)[patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/montclair-hammers-out-town-school-budgets-see-tax-impacts#:~:text=Wednesday%2C%20May%2028%20,9%20pm). No new tax ordinances were introduced beyond the budget’s scope, but officials did advance supportive policy measures. For example, the Council gave initial approval to an ordinance boosting **library funding** [muckrack.com](https://muckrack.com/steven-maginnis/articles#:~:text=,Steven%20Maginnis%2C%20Natalie%20Heard) – a **first-reading** vote to ensure Montclair’s libraries are adequately supported after community concern over past budget shortfalls. This signals a strong commitment to public resources and earned nods from residents who championed the cause. Additionally, an update to parking and traffic regulations (Ordinance O-25-16) was passed to improve local traffic flow [instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/p/DKKLSYxNaiV/#:~:text=Montclair%20New%20Jersey%20,of%20the%20township%20code), showing the Council’s attention to quality-of-life fixes.

**Looking Ahead:** A formal **public hearing and budget adoption** vote is scheduled for the **June 3** Council meeting [patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/montclair-hammers-out-town-school-budgets-see-tax-impacts#:~:text=A%20public%20hearing%20and%20adoption,council%20meeting%20on%20June%203). With departmental reviews complete and only minor tweaks anticipated, Montclair appears on track to finalize a budget that balances fiscal prudence with community needs. The approach of keeping the tax increase under 2% while maintaining services has been well-received as a sign of sound stewardship. *Local fiscal metaphor:* The township is carefully tending its **oak tree of public finance**, watering it with just enough tax revenue to keep it healthy without overburdening the roots (taxpayers).

The **“Squirrel Market”** – Montclair’s acorn-themed analog to Wall Street – saw mixed but mostly positive movement across its **Magnificent 7** civic-economic sectors. Below is a snapshot of key local indicators (“ETFs”) and how they fared this week:

* **ACH (Acorn Civic Holdings – Public Finance & Infrastructure):** **▲ Up.** *Focus:* Township finances, capital projects, and infrastructure. **Why:** Progress on the town budget and capital investments gave ACH a boost. The near-finalized budget with disciplined surplus use and targeted spending (e.g. firehouse rehab, street safety initiatives) instilled confidence [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/7-things-to-know-about-montclairs-108m-town-budget-for-2025/#:~:text=5). Montclair’s **acorn hoard** (reserves) remains intact and well-managed, indicating fiscal stability. Infrastructure projects are moving forward (road improvements, facility upgrades), which bodes well for long-term civic health. Overall, Montclair’s government showed it can invest in the future without stripping the pantry bare, sending ACH modestly higher.
* **ACB (Acorn Community Business – Local Economy & Small Biz):** **▲ Slightly Up.** *Focus:* Small businesses, retail and dining, local job market. **Why:** Montclair’s local business scene had a dynamic week of turnover that netted a cautiously positive outlook. On one hand, **new ventures are sprouting**: for example, *El Gordo Peruvian Eatery* just opened on Orange Road, bringing new flavors and investment to the South End [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-essex-county-nj-spring-2025/#:~:text=El%20Gordo%20Peruvian%20Eatery%20,324B%20Orange%20Road%2C%20Montclair). A bespoke lingerie design studio, *Greymade* on Church Street, is another recent addition, catering to a niche market with an inclusive twist (custom-tailored pieces for all clients)[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-essex-county-nj-spring-2025/#:~:text=match%20at%20L136%20bespoke%20lingerie,client%2C%E2%80%9D%20according%20to%20its%20website). These openings signal confidence in Montclair’s marketplace and are creating jobs. However, **acorns were spilled** with a couple of closures earlier in May – notably *Tasca*, an upscale Iberian bistro that shuttered on May 4 less than a year after its debut [patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/iberian-bistro-montclair-will-be-closing-soon-owner-says#:~:text=Tasca%20at%20377%20Bloomfield%20Avenue,the%20public%20in%20May%202024), and beloved Watchung Plaza café *Da Pepo*, which served its last pasta on May 10 [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/last-call-for-pasta-da-pepo-closing-its-doors-may-10/#:~:text=Da%20Pepo%2C%20the%20cozy%20Italian,meals%20on%20Saturday%2C%20May%2010). Those losses illustrate challenges (high rents, competition, labor costs) that can strain newcomers and longtime establishments alike. Still, foot traffic downtown remains strong and community support for shopping local is high. Unemployment in the area remains relatively low (Essex County \~5.6% in April [ycharts.com](https://ycharts.com/indicators/essex_county_nj_unemployment_rate#:~:text=Essex%20County%2C%20NJ%20Unemployment%20Rate,for%20Apr%202025.%20Watchlist), likely lower in Montclair proper), suggesting steady consumer spending capacity. Net-net, ACB inched up on the strength of new investments, though tempered by the ever-present cautionary tales of the competitive restaurant/retail scene.
* **ACT (Acorn Arts, Culture & Tourism):** **▶️ Steady.** *Focus:* Arts institutions, cultural events, and tourism activity. **Why:** Montclair’s cultural calendar was relatively routine this week with no major festivals, keeping ACT stable. The spring arts scene continues to be lively but in a maintenance phase: local theaters, galleries, and the Montclair Art Museum ran regular programming without big headlines. The **Walnut Street Fair** and **May in Montclair** events earlier in the month were successful in drawing crowds, and plans are underway for summer favorites (e.g. Montclair Jazz Festival later this summer). Tourists and visitors trickled in at normal rates – no big surges, but steady patronage at cultural sites, restaurants, and shops from out-of-towners visiting friends or attending minor events. Montclair’s film and foodie reputation keeps weekend hotel bookings decent. In short, ACT held its ground: the **squirrels of culture** neither gained nor lost momentum this week, awaiting the next big spark (like June’s arts happenings or summer events) to make a move.
* **ACE (Acorn Civic Engagement – Education & Community Initiatives):** **▲ Up.** *Focus:* Education, schools, and community engagement programs. **Why:** It was a fruitful week for community and educational initiatives. The **Montclair Board of Education** finalized its FY2025–26 school budget earlier in May, which, while raising the school tax levy \~5.6%, preserves school programs and staffing [patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/montclair-hammers-out-town-school-budgets-see-tax-impacts#:~:text=A%20homeowner%20with%20a%20property,Hacks%20Away%20At%20Budget%20Gap). More exciting on the community side, local nonprofits got a significant boost: **The Montclair Foundation awarded $90,000 in spring grants to 17 local nonprofits** supporting education, community service, and cultural arts [cnjg.org](https://www.cnjg.org/news/montclair-foundation-awards-90000-grants#:~:text=Wednesday%2C%20May%2021%2C%202025). This included a multi-year grant to *Imani*, a youth enrichment program, and $15,000 to the Montclair Ambulance Unit for community outreach [cnjg.org](https://www.cnjg.org/news/montclair-foundation-awards-90000-grants#:~:text=This%20season%E2%80%99s%20recipients%20include%20organizations,invaluable%20work%20in%20the%20community). The infusion of funding empowers after-school programs, tutoring services, arts education and more – all seeds that strengthen the community oak’s roots. Additionally, Montclair’s beloved soup kitchen and food pantry, **Toni’s Kitchen**, celebrated a **$250,000 state grant** to expand its food security work [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/tonis-kitchen-celebrates-250000-state-grant-to-support-food-work/#:~:text=On%20Sunday%2C%20May%2018%2C%202025%2C,work%20done%20in%20local%20communities). Mayor Dr. Renee Baskerville and state officials marked the occasion on May 18, highlighting how civic and state support is addressing local hunger needs [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/tonis-kitchen-celebrates-250000-state-grant-to-support-food-work/#:~:text=On%20Sunday%2C%20May%2018%2C%202025%2C,work%20done%20in%20local%20communities)[montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/tonis-kitchen-celebrates-250000-state-grant-to-support-food-work/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20facing%20challenging%20times,Executive%20Director%20of%20Toni%E2%80%99s%20Kitchen). These positive developments in volunteerism, philanthropy, and education lifted ACE upward. Volunteer turnout also remains high – whether it’s neighbors tending community gardens or high schoolers prepping for June service projects, civic spirit is robust. Montclair’s community engagement acorn is shining bright as residents invest time and money back into their town.
* **NUT (Necessities, Utilities, Transit – Cost of Living Index):** **▼ Slightly Down.** *Focus:* Everyday cost-of-living, essential services, and affordability. **Why:** Montclair’s cost of essentials continues to pose challenges, causing a minor dip in NUT. **Housing affordability** remains a thorn – while home values are high (median price \~$1.1M in late 2024)[medium.com](https://medium.com/@thedailysquirrelnews/montclair-news-weekly-briefings-5d725c09fe6c#:~:text=Montclair%E2%80%99s%20housing%20market%20has%20seen,those%20in%20the%20Fourth%20Ward), supply is low, and rents have been creeping upward, pressuring lower- and middle-income families. The new municipal budget does include a modest tax increase [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/7-things-to-know-about-montclairs-108m-town-budget-for-2025/#:~:text=The%20proposed%20spending%20plan%20introduced,home%2C%20according%20to%20the%20presentation), which, though relatively small, adds another straw to the load that property owners carry. Utilities (water, gas, electricity) saw typical seasonal usage upticks; there’s local chatter about upcoming investments needed in Montclair’s **water infrastructure** (to replace aging pipes), which could translate to higher bills down the road. At the grocery stores and farmers market, residents still face inflated food prices compared to a year ago, reflecting national trends. Gasoline for commuters has fluctuated but averaged slightly higher than earlier in the spring, nibbling at wallets. Perhaps most telling, **demand at food pantries is rising** – Toni’s Kitchen noted that many working families are struggling to make ends meet despite the strong economy, calling this moment “challenging times” with a widening gap between need and funding [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/tonis-kitchen-celebrates-250000-state-grant-to-support-food-work/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20facing%20challenging%20times,Executive%20Director%20of%20Toni%E2%80%99s%20Kitchen). All these factors contributed to a small **“acorn crunch”** for households: some are dipping into savings or cutting discretionary spending to cover the basics. On a positive note, Montclair’s new rent control ordinance (passed earlier this year) is in effect, aiming to curb the steepest rent hikes and provide relief for tenants. But its impact will be gradual. For now, NUT reflects a slight decline, symbolizing the **pinch felt in the pantry** as Montclairians manage the costs of their daily bread (and acorns).
* **LUX (Luxury & Upscale Market):** **▶️ Steady.** *Focus:* High-end real estate, luxury goods, and upscale dining/retail. **Why:** The upscale segment of Montclair’s economy held steady at its lofty perch this week. **Real estate** at the top end continues to attract interest – there’s buzz about a couple of multimillion-dollar historic homes quietly changing hands this spring (Montclair’s charm remains a hot commodity for well-heeled buyers). Investor confidence in Montclair real estate was underscored last month when a **200-unit apartment building sold for $96 million** after securing a favorable tax deal [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/04/200-unit-building-in-montclair-sells-for-96m-after-tax-deal-okd/#:~:text=OK%27d%20montclairlocal,21%2C%202025%20at%208%3A20%20pm). That kind of major investment (one of the largest sales in town history) is a vote of confidence in Montclair’s rental market. No similarly big deals occurred this week, but the afterglow persists. On the retail side, luxury boutiques and home décor shops in town report stable sales – Montclair’s affluent residents are still shopping, dining, and indulging, though perhaps with slightly more discernment amid economic cross-currents. High-end restaurants are generally doing well (reservation books at the likes of Faubourg remain full on weekends), even as the mid-tier bistros felt more churn. One notable upcoming addition to the luxury dining scene: acclaimed Iron Chef *Masaharu Morimoto* is poised to open a restaurant in Montclair later this year [instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/p/DJMLliSx85O/#:~:text=NEW%20businesses%20in%20the%20Montclair,open%20his%20new%20Montclair), signaling that the town’s upscale dining reputation is only growing. Overall, LUX didn’t see a big jump or drop – the wealthy squirrels of Upper Montclair are **comfortably hoarding** and spending at usual levels, keeping this index on an even keel.
* **GRR (Growth, Redevelopment & Resilience – “Growl” Index):** **▲ Up (slightly).** *Focus:* Major development projects, environmental sustainability, and regulatory climate. **Why:** GRR – whimsically dubbed the “Growl” index – tracks the rumblings (both positive and negative) around Montclair’s big projects and policies. This week brought more purr than growl. **Lackawanna Plaza**, the massive mixed-use redevelopment in the Fourth Ward, hit a milestone: the designated developer is finalizing site plans, with a **preliminary site plan due by June 1, 2025** [patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/montclair-chooses-developer-lackawanna-plaza-project-advances#:~:text=The%20council%20amended%20some%20of,due%20by%20June%201%2C%202025). The project (hundreds of apartments, a supermarket, and public space on the old train station site) still faces some legal challenges and resident scrutiny, but the fact that it’s advancing on schedule is a plus for growth. A successful redevelopment will revitalize a long-vacant area and address the **food desert** issue by bringing a grocery store back to the neighborhood – a win for resilience and equity. Meanwhile, the Council debated a **redevelopment agreement transfer** at a recent meeting (ensuring oversight as developers change hands) and has been actively managing zoning to guide smart growth [facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/groups/montclairnewjersey/posts/4031991560370038/#:~:text=,Montclair). On the **environmental** front, Montclair continues to push green initiatives: plans for expanding electric vehicle charging stations and a potential stormwater management ordinance are in the works, although no new ordinances passed this week. Community environmental groups remain active (the *Friends of Anderson Park* just wrapped up a successful youth writing contest highlighting nature appreciation). All this points to constructive growth with an eye on sustainability. One note of concern: Montclair was **flagged by federal officials regarding its “sanctuary city” status** (a news item just emerging at week’s end)[patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/montclair-hammers-out-town-school-budgets-see-tax-impacts#:~:text=Politics%20%26%20Government). The feds are demanding compliance on immigration enforcement, which could theoretically threaten some funding if not resolved. This has some officials growling about federal overreach. However, it’s too early to tell if that poses any real economic risk. For now, the tangible progress on development and continued climate resilience planning outweighed the bureaucratic clouds. GRR ticked up accordingly, reflecting guarded optimism that Montclair can grow without losing its soul – all while weathering any external growls.

**Summary:** In aggregate, the **Magnificent 7** indices present a picture of Montclair’s economy as a sturdy oak swaying in late-spring breezes – **strong civic roots and vibrant community branches, with a few leaves rustling from economic winds.** The Squirrel Market overall is upbeat but grounded: big projects are moving, small businesses are finding opportunities (amid some pitfalls), and civic engagement is fortifying the town’s resilience. At the same time, cost-of-living and affordability remain the gnawing squirrel in the attic, reminding everyone that not all share equally in Montclair’s prosperity. The coming weeks – with the budget adoption and the start of summer activities – will show whether the town can continue to **nourish its oak** through careful policy and inclusive growth, or whether any new stresses will cause a **few acorns to rot**.

# Community & Business Buzz 📰🌱

**Business Openings & Closings:** Montclair saw a lively shuffle in its business community this period:

* *New “Acorns” Sprouting:* A number of new establishments have recently opened, reflecting investor and entrepreneurial confidence in Montclair. **El Gordo**, a family-run Peruvian eatery at 324B Orange Road, opened its doors and is already drawing local foodies with its ceviches and lomo saltado [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-essex-county-nj-spring-2025/#:~:text=El%20Gordo%20Peruvian%20Eatery%20,324B%20Orange%20Road%2C%20Montclair). Over on Church Street, **Greymade** – an appointment-only bespoke lingerie studio – launched earlier this year and continues to gain buzz for its inclusive, custom-tailored approach to fashion [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-essex-county-nj-spring-2025/#:~:text=match%20at%20L136%20bespoke%20lingerie,client%2C%E2%80%9D%20according%20to%20its%20website). Also new on Bloomfield Avenue is **Mashed Burgers**, a casual spot specializing in halal smash burgers and shakes, marking an expansion of that regional franchise into Montclair’s competitive burger scene [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-essex-county-nj-spring-2025/#:~:text=match%20at%20L232%20360%20location,and%20Hoboken%20at%C2%A0515%20Washington%20Street). These additions diversify the retail and dining landscape, offering fresh flavors and services. They also signal that despite high rents, Montclair remains an attractive market for both local startups and well-known chefs (with more on the way, e.g. Morimoto’s venture).
* *Farewell to a Few:* In the same breath, Montclair bid adieu to some establishments. **Tasca**, the modern Iberian bistro which opened with much acclaim in spring 2024, closed on May 4, 2025 [patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/iberian-bistro-montclair-will-be-closing-soon-owner-says#:~:text=Tasca%20at%20377%20Bloomfield%20Avenue,the%20public%20in%20May%202024). Despite rave reviews (it even earned “Restaurant of the Year” honors), the owner cited personal and logistical challenges in juggling multiple locations. Similarly, **Da Pepo**, a cozy Italian café tucked next to Watchung Booksellers, served its *“last call for pasta”* on May 10 after many successful years [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/last-call-for-pasta-da-pepo-closing-its-doors-may-10/#:~:text=Da%20Pepo%2C%20the%20cozy%20Italian,meals%20on%20Saturday%2C%20May%2010). These closings underscore the tough reality of Montclair’s restaurant sector: even in a foodie town, competition is stiff and margins thin. Fortunately, in both cases the community is hopeful new concepts will take root in those locations by fall, keeping those storefronts from staying dark too long.

**Jobs & Workforce:** The local job market remains solid. There have been **no major layoffs** reported among Montclair’s larger employers, and many small businesses are actually **hiring seasonal staff** as summer approaches (from restaurant patios to summer camp counselors). Montclair’s unemployment rate isn’t published monthly at the town level, but county data (\~5.6% jobless [ycharts.com](https://ycharts.com/indicators/essex_county_nj_unemployment_rate#:~:text=Essex%20County%2C%20NJ%20Unemployment%20Rate,for%20Apr%202025.%20Watchlist)) and anecdotal evidence (lots of “Help Wanted” signs in shop windows) suggest a healthy labor scene. That said, businesses do report difficulty filling some positions, especially in food service and retail, which is a trend seen across New Jersey. Wages in Montclair tend to be a bit higher than elsewhere in the region, given the high cost of living, and that has helped draw workers in. The robust employment situation contributes to steady consumer spending – people with paychecks are out shopping at farmers’ markets and dining downtown – fueling the virtuous cycle of the Squirrel Market.

**Major Projects & Initiatives:** Construction and infrastructure projects are in focus as we head into summer. Aside from the **Lackawanna Plaza** redevelopment moving through the approval pipeline, the township is also advancing a plan to **repave and improve Bloomfield Avenue** in segments (a long-awaited relief for motorists dodging potholes). A streetscape project in the South End business district is breaking ground, aiming to beautify and boost that neighborhood’s commerce. Additionally, Montclair State University (just up the hill in the Township’s Montclair Heights area) is planning a conference center expansion which could increase local business patronage when events resume there. On the community initiative front, the Montclair Climate Action group has launched a “**Plant an Acorn**” campaign encouraging residents to plant oak saplings around town – a symbolic and literal effort to keep Montclair green for generations. The week saw several volunteers digging in to add trees to parks and front yards, a feel-good project supported by the Parks Department and local nurseries.

Finally, the Memorial Day weekend (May 24–26) brought the community together in observance and celebration. Montclair’s **Memorial Day parade and ceremony** on May 26 was well-attended, with residents lining the streets to honor veterans. Such community gatherings, while solemn in purpose, also have an economic side-benefit: downtown eateries and cafes reported a bump in business from parade-goers grabbing brunch or coffee, and vendors at the event (like local bakeries and florists) saw brisk sales. It’s a reminder that community spirit and the economy often **grow together from the same acorn**.

# Golden Acorn Awards & Rotten Acorn Alerts 🏆🌰🚨

Each week, Montclair’s Daily Squirrel bestows **Golden Acorn Awards** for initiatives that nurture our community oak, and issues **Rotten Acorn Alerts** for those that threaten to rot our town’s prosperity:

* **Golden Acorn Award:** *Community Support Network Edition.* This week’s Golden Acorn goes jointly to **Toni’s Kitchen and The Montclair Foundation** for strengthening Montclair’s social safety net and civic capital. Toni’s Kitchen, a local food ministry, received a **$250,000 state grant** to expand its fight against hunger [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/tonis-kitchen-celebrates-250000-state-grant-to-support-food-work/#:~:text=On%20Sunday%2C%20May%2018%2C%202025%2C,work%20done%20in%20local%20communities), at a time when demand for its services is rising. The funds will help deliver healthy groceries to families in need through innovative programs, truly exemplifying Montclair’s spirit of compassion. In parallel, The Montclair Foundation awarded **$90,000 in grants to 17 nonprofits** in town, bolstering everything from education and youth mentoring to arts and emergency services [cnjg.org](https://www.cnjg.org/news/montclair-foundation-awards-90000-grants#:~:text=The%20Montclair%20Foundation%20is%20proud,strengthening%20the%20greater%20Montclair%20community). This infusion of resources – made possible by generous donors and diligent volunteers – is an investment in our community’s heart. Together, these actions ensure that as Montclair prospers, it also **takes care of its own**, leaving no squirrel hungry or unsupported. For their contributions to a more **vibrant, inclusive, and compassionate community** [cnjg.org](https://www.cnjg.org/news/montclair-foundation-awards-90000-grants#:~:text=The%20Montclair%20Foundation%20is%20proud,strengthening%20the%20greater%20Montclair%20community)[cnjg.org](https://www.cnjg.org/news/montclair-foundation-awards-90000-grants#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20incredibly%20grateful%20to,%E2%80%9D), we sprinkle these organizations with a shower of golden acorns. 🥇🌰
* **Rotten Acorn Alert:** *Affordability Crunch.* This unwanted alert highlights the growing **affordability challenges** in Montclair’s otherwise thriving economy. Even as our town flourishes, some residents are feeling the squeeze of rising costs – a few acorns in the bushel are turning rotten. **Housing and taxes** remain chief concerns. The average property tax bill in Montclair is projected around **$22.5k this year (all-in) for a median home** [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/7-things-to-know-about-montclairs-108m-town-budget-for-2025/#:~:text=The%20proposed%20spending%20plan%20introduced,home%2C%20according%20to%20the%20presentation), a hefty sum that many households struggle to pay. Renters, too, face steep rents that have climbed sharply in recent years amid low supply. The closure of **affordable eateries** like *Tasca* after only one year – despite popularity – hints that even businesses catering to discretionary spenders find the environment tough [patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/iberian-bistro-montclair-will-be-closing-soon-owner-says#:~:text=Tasca%20at%20377%20Bloomfield%20Avenue,the%20public%20in%20May%202024). And the very need for large grants to food pantries underscores that **economic inequality** and food insecurity persist beneath Montclair’s affluent surface [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/tonis-kitchen-celebrates-250000-state-grant-to-support-food-work/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20facing%20challenging%20times,Executive%20Director%20of%20Toni%E2%80%99s%20Kitchen). In short, while Montclair’s oak tree grows tall, not all of its acorns are getting the sunlight. The **“Rotten Acorn”** goes to the factors driving this cost-of-living crunch – from high taxes to expensive housing – which risk pricing out diversity and hollowing our community if left unchecked. It’s a call to action for policy makers to double-down on affordability initiatives (like the new rent control and upcoming affordable units in developments) to ensure Montclair’s prosperity is broadly shared. 🌰🚫

*In conclusion,* Montclair’s acorn-infused economy closed out May on a hopeful note. The **community’s oak** is thriving: fed by prudent governance, active civic groups, and resilient businesses. Still, like any tree heading into summer, it needs watering (inclusive policies) and watchful eyes for pests (cost pressures) to ensure the growth continues. With its **Acorn Index** inching upward and a rich ecosystem of public and private initiatives, Montclair stands as a model of how a local economy can be both **vibrant and community-minded**. As we move into June, all eyes (and bushy tails) will be on the Town Council’s final budget adoption and the rollout of summer economic activity. Will Montclair’s squirrels continue to **hoard confidence** and invest in their town, or will an unforeseen challenge cause a **crunch**? Stay tuned for the next Acorn Economy Report to see how our mighty oak holds up.

At Crunchkin Sips, [the best cafe in Trivandrum,](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2004370277564765640/5677072196192760307?hl=en#)  most of our customers ask us one thing- “How do we make our cake look so beautiful?” Though it takes years of practice, with some simple tips any person can decorate their cake beautifully.

If you ever thought that cake decorating is only for professional pastry chefs, you are wrong. With these simple tips, you can make your cakes look fancy. Here are some decorating tips that will make you the boss of frosting.

# 1. Just Chill

Make the cake cold before decorating. Chill your cake in the fridge before frosting. Chilling cakes will help reduce the crumbs and will also keep your icing smooth.

# 2. Nude Is The New Accessory

The “naked cake” trend is simple yet stylish. Just spread a thin layer of frosting on your cake and let the cake’s layer peek through the frosting. 

# 3. Zip It and Pipe It

In case you forgot to buy a piping bag, don.t worry. Grab a Ziplock bag, fill it with your frosting, and snip the corner, and boom- your instant piping tool is ready. This is a great tool for writing wishes on your cakes or drawing some swirls.

4. Hot Tools For Smooth Finish 

Do you want to give sleek edges to your cake? Use a hot spatula to smoothen the frosting on the edges of your cake. This trick will give your cakes a silky smooth finish every time.

5. Edible Decor

Get creative with your decoration - you can use crushed ParleG biscuits to make edible sand. You can use fondants to create edible flowers, favorite characters etc.

# 5. Go Fruity

Use fruits to decorate your cake. Top your cake with fresh berries, sliced mangoes, or pineapple. This will make your cake taste good and look good.

# 6. Let It Glitter 

Sprinkle some edible glitter or a silver leaf for a little sparkle. This makes your cake photogenic.

# 7. Stencil It

Use a custom stencil and dust it with powdered sugar or cocoa. This is the easiest way to get professional looking cakes.

8.Trendy Textures

Well it’s not necessary that your cake should look smooth every time, add textures to your cake using the back of a spoon or fork. Create rustic patterns like swirls, waves or ridges.

# From Our Kitchen to Yours…

# At the end of the day, you should enjoy what you are doing. It's about expressing yourself, experimenting, and—yes—even making a bit of a mess. Remember even if the cake looks messy, it will still taste sweet. Whether you're trying your hand at decorating for the first time or you’re a long-time home baker, we hope these tips bring a little extra magic to your creations. And if you ever need a little help—or a show-stopping cake for your next celebration or a hot cup of espresso coffee—you know where to find us.

i wake up in the morning feeling sick and can't bare the idea of solid food, so i go with coffee or tea.
after 2-3 hours tho, i get extreme hunger and find myself eating homemade granola and/or fruit (my only two safe foods) until i feel satisfied (which isn't quite a large amount of food but it does the job quite well).
my hunger comes and goes in waves and i try to satisfy it, but then i feel completely full for the rest of the day and find myself skipping the afternoon snack and dinner. I know i should push my limits but i physically can't take any more food if i feel satisfied.
what am i doing wrong? why do i feel extreme hunger already? isn't it too soon? shouldn't it come up later in recovery? why do i feel satisfied with not really large quantities of food? I'm so scared and feel like im failing at recovery ",2,1748949545.0,AnorexiaRecovery,1,1.0,False

I have been on an alt grind and loving it.

Did LS as league start so enjoyed it already and never want to touch lightning spear ever again. 

Killed pinnacles with lightning arrow deadeye.

Did everything with lich essence drain/contagion.

Made a mace monk and multiple chonk alts trying all different weapons.

Monk is the main class I play and have played the hell out of invoker and chonk now. 

Have played an insane amount of chaos damage builds including all conversions of ele to chaos etc.

Was interested in maybe doing a merc for the laser beam and rail gun stuff.

Have no desire to play warrior, i did all the mace stuff and I hate the left side of the tree. It’s fun but it’s so slow and with crit being so strong for most builds I always end up back on the right side of the tree or wanting to be there.

So my options are basically xbow, spells or something with spear that is not LS.

I do like combo gameplay, while flicker and ice strike are preferred I did really enjoy playing a monk just using combos so was thinking about a huntress using parry maybe. 

Only actual class I never made was a sorc but the ascendancies seem terrible for any builds and casting fire wall or ice wall and throwing stuff into it just isn’t that exciting to me and I can’t seem to find any other spell builds that don’t pretty much do that.

Looking for any cool builds or ideas anyone has while we wait for the new patch that I’m convinced at this point is going to be delayed until after Poe 1 comes out.

We call it “networking,” but so often, conversations at events, on LinkedIn, or even over coffee revolve around people venting about terrible bosses, toxic jobs, layoffs, or how tired they are.

Are we really networking for opportunity… or are we low-key using it as a collective therapy session?

👉 Should we stop pretending networking is just about ambition + hustle, and admit it’s become a place to process workplace trauma?
👉 Or is this just part of how modern work relationships are built — through shared scars?

Curious how many of you have made meaningful connections not through polished elevator pitches, but through raw, human, “man, this job is eating me alive” honesty.

We craved the quiet of the backcountry, the chance to see snow-draped pines and frozen streams without the summer crowds. We spent hours packing: insulated sleeping bags rated for subzero temperatures, a four-season tent with heavy-duty stakes, dehydrated meals, a portable stove, and two canisters of bear spray each. We studied trail maps, marked our route to a remote campsite by a frozen stream, and double-checked our gear. Rangers had warned about black bears that sometimes didn’t hibernate if food was scarce, so we memorized safety tips: store food far from the tent, make noise to avoid surprising wildlife, and never run from a bear. Confident and excited, we felt ready for anything.We reached the trailhead in the late morning, our boots crunching on fresh snow as we hiked three miles to our spot. The campsite was perfect: a flat clearing near a stream, its surface a glassy sheet of ice, surrounded by towering pines bowing under heavy snow. The air was crisp, and the silence was so deep it felt like the world was holding its breath. We set up the tent, hammering stakes into the frozen ground, and hung our food in bear-proof containers 200 feet away, tied high between two trees. That afternoon, we hiked a nearby trail, marveling at elk tracks in the snow and the way the sunlight sparkled on the icy landscape. By evening, we built a small fire, cooked a meal of rehydrated chili, and laughed about how we’d tell our friends back home we were “tough” for camping in winter. As night fell, we cleaned every scrap of food, zipped into our sleeping bags, and drifted off, warm and content.I woke to a sound that sent a chill down my spine—slow, heavy crunching in the snow, like something big circling our tent. My heart thudded as I lay still, straining to hear. The clock on my watch glowed 1:17 a.m. I nudged Jamie, who was buried in their sleeping bag. “Hey, wake up,” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “Something’s out there.” Jamie stirred, groggy, their breath visible in the cold air. “What is it?” they mumbled, rubbing their eyes. Another crunch, louder, followed by a low, guttural huff. My stomach dropped. “That’s not a deer,” I said, fumbling for my bear spray in the dark. Jamie sat up, grabbing their own canister. “A bear?” they asked, voice tight with fear. We sat frozen, listening as the footsteps circled closer, the snow creaking under its weight. Then came a scraping sound, like claws dragging across the tent’s nylon wall.I unzipped the tent flap just a fraction, my hands shaking so badly I could barely grip the zipper. In the pale moonlight, I saw it: a massive black bear, its fur matted, sniffing the ground where our fire had burned out hours ago. Its eyes caught the light, glinting like cold steel as it turned toward the tent. My pulse roared in my ears. “Stay still,” I whispered to Jamie, clutching the bear spray. “Don’t move.” Jamie nodded, their breathing shallow. “Hey, bear!” I shouted, forcing my voice to sound steady. “Go away! Get out!” Jamie joined in, clapping their hands and yelling, “Leave us alone!” The bear paused, ears twitching, but instead of backing off, it took a step closer, its head low, sniffing the air.Panic clawed at me. “It’s not leaving,” Jamie hissed, their voice trembling. The bear pawed at the tent, its claws catching the fabric with a sickening rip. The tear was small at first, but the bear kept digging, widening it. “Spray it!” Jamie urged, their voice rising. I aimed the bear spray through the flap and pressed the trigger, sending a cloud of stinging mist at the bear’s face. It snorted, shaking its head violently, but didn’t retreat. Instead, it lunged, ripping the tent open with a deafening tear. Its massive head pushed through, jaws snapping, hot breath steaming in the cold air. Jamie screamed, scrambling backward, their sleeping bag tangling around their legs. I sprayed again, the mist burning my eyes and throat, but the bear was too close, unfazed.“Get back!” I yelled, my voice cracking. Jamie grabbed a flashlight from their pack and swung it wildly, the beam dancing across the bear’s face. The bear swiped, its paw knocking the flashlight to the ground and raking Jamie’s arm. They cried out, blood soaking through their jacket sleeve, dark and glistening in the dim light. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst. I dropped the bear spray, useless now, and grabbed the camping knife from my pack, its six-inch blade feeling pathetically small. “Stay away!” I shouted, thrusting the knife at the bear’s shoulder. The blade sank in, and the bear roared, a sound that shook me to my core. It swiped at me, its claws grazing my thigh, pain searing through me like fire. I stabbed again, desperate, and the bear finally staggered back, ripping through the tent’s remains as it retreated into the darkness.We collapsed, gasping, the cold air rushing into the ruined tent. The bear’s footsteps faded, but I couldn’t stop shaking. “Are you okay?” I asked, crawling to Jamie. They were clutching their arm, blood dripping onto the snow. “It hurts so bad,” they said, teeth gritted. “I can’t move it much.” My thigh was bleeding, the claw marks shallow but stinging. I ripped open our first aid kit, hands trembling as I wrapped gauze around Jamie’s arm, tying it tight to slow the bleeding. My own wound was less severe, but every movement burned. “We can’t stay here,” I said, glancing at the shredded tent. “The bear could come back.” Jamie nodded, pale and sweating despite the cold. “The car,” they said. “We have to get to the car.”The car was three miles away, back at the trailhead, through deep snow and dense forest. We grabbed what we could—bear spray, water, a flashlight, and a map—and stuffed them into a backpack. Jamie leaned on me, their arm useless, limping as we started hiking. The snow was knee-deep in places, dragging at our boots, and every rustle in the trees made me flinch, certain the bear was following us. “Keep talking,” I said, my voice shaky. “It’ll keep animals away.” Jamie tried, muttering about anything—work, movies, the chili we ate—but their voice was weak, and I could tell they were struggling. “We’re gonna make it,” I kept saying, as much for myself as for them.After an hour, maybe two, my legs felt like lead, and Jamie was barely moving. Their face was ghostly white, their arm swollen under the bandage. “I need to stop,” they whispered, slumping against a tree. “Just for a bit.” I didn’t want to stop—every second felt like tempting fate—but Jamie couldn’t go on. We found a cluster of pines with branches that blocked the wind and gathered dry twigs for a fire. My hands were so numb I could barely strike the match, but the small flames caught, casting flickering shadows. We sat close, the fire’s warmth a faint comfort against the biting cold. “What if it comes back?” I asked, scanning the dark woods. Jamie didn’t look at me, just stared at the fire. “We hurt it,” they said quietly. “It won’t want to mess with us again.” But their voice wavered, and I knew they didn’t believe it.The silence was heavy, broken only by the fire’s crackle and the occasional snap of a branch in the distance. Each sound made my heart race, my hand tightening on the bear spray. I kept picturing the bear’s eyes, its teeth, the way it tore through our tent like paper. Jamie shifted, wincing. “You think we’re close to the car?” they asked. I pulled out the map, but in the dim firelight, it was hard to tell. “Maybe halfway,” I said, hoping I was right. We stayed there until the sky started to lighten, the first gray streaks of dawn filtering THROUGH the trees. “Let’s go,” I said, helping Jamie up. They leaned heavily on me, their steps uneven.The hike felt endless. The snow seemed to fight us, clinging to our boots, and my thigh throbbed with every step. Jamie was quiet now, saving their energy, their breath coming in short gasps. I kept talking, rambling about anything to keep us both calm—our favorite diner back home, the time we got lost on a summer hike and laughed it off. But the fear never left, a tight knot in my chest. Every shadow looked like a bear, every sound like claws in the snow. “We’re almost there,” I said, more prayer than fact, as the trail started to look familiar.Finally, after what felt like a lifetime, we saw the parking lot, the car a distant speck through the trees. Relief flooded me, but I didn’t let myself relax until we were inside, doors locked, the engine sputtering to life. Jamie slumped in the passenger seat, eyes half-closed. “We made it,” they whispered, a faint smile breaking through the pain. I drove to the nearest hospital, my hands still shaking on the wheel, the image of the bear burned into my mind.At the hospital, doctors stitched Jamie’s arm, saying the claw marks were deep but clean. My thigh needed a few stitches too, but I was lucky—the bear had barely caught me. A ranger visited us later, explaining that the bear was likely a young male, half-starved and desperate, which made it bold enough to attack. They’d track it, they said, to make sure it didn’t hurt anyone else. Sitting in the sterile hospital room, Jamie looked at me, their arm in a sling. “No more winter camping,” they said, managing a weak laugh. I nodded, my throat tight. “Never again.” The memory of that night—the crunch of snow, the bear’s roar, the tearing fabric—stayed with me, a reminder of how quickly the wild can turn deadly.

  


# ""Whiteout"":

I tugged my jacket tighter, the chill seeping through as Alex and I hiked deeper into the mountains. The trail was narrow, lined with pine trees, their needles crunching under our boots. My backpack dug into my shoulders, stuffed with our tent, sleeping bags, a small stove, and enough food for two nights. We’d been planning this trip for weeks, craving a quiet weekend by the lake. The air smelled of earth and resin, and the only sounds were our steps and the occasional chirp of a bird. By late afternoon, the lake came into view, its surface dark and still, reflecting the gray sky. We picked a flat spot near the shore, surrounded by tall grasses and a ring of stones left by past campers.“Perfect spot,” Alex said, dropping his pack with a thud. His breath puffed out in a small cloud. “Let’s get that fire going.”“Yeah, I’m starving,” I replied, unloading my gear. We set up the tent, its green fabric blending with the trees. I hammered stakes into the soft ground, my hands already stiff from the cold. Alex gathered sticks, snapping them over his knee, and soon our fire crackled, casting a warm glow. We cooked beans and hot dogs on the stove, the smell making my mouth water. As we ate, we talked about old camping trips, laughing about the time Alex forgot the matches and we tried to start a fire with flint for hours.“Think we’ll see any stars tonight?” Alex asked, leaning back on a log, poking the fire with a stick.“Hope so,” I said, glancing up. “Nothing beats a clear sky out here.”The fire died down to embers, and we crawled into the tent, zipping ourselves into sleeping bags. I fell asleep to the faint rustle of wind through the pines, feeling safe, like the forest was ours.A loud thud jolted me awake. My heart pounded, eyes wide in the dark. The tent sagged, something heavy pressing against it. I fumbled for my flashlight, its beam shaking as I aimed it at the walls. Snow. Thick, wet clumps were piling up, bending the poles. The air inside felt sharp, colder than before.“Alex, wake up!” I shook his shoulder hard. “We’re in trouble.”He groaned, blinking slowly. “What’s going on?”“Snow. It’s burying the tent.”We scrambled out of our sleeping bags, pulling on boots and jackets. I unzipped the tent, and a blast of icy air hit my face. Snow poured in, already ankle-deep. Outside, the campfire was gone, smothered under a white blanket. Our stove, left by the rocks, was half-buried, and the lake was a faint outline through the falling flakes. My stomach knotted. This wasn’t supposed to happen. We’d checked the forecast—clear skies, cold but manageable. Now, the world was white, disorienting.“We need to get to the car,” I said, my voice unsteady. “We can’t stay here.”Alex nodded, his face pale under his hood. “Yeah, let’s pack fast.”We stuffed our gear into our packs, hands trembling. My fingers fumbled with the tent stakes, numb despite my gloves. Snow clung to my sleeves, melting into my cuffs. The trail back to the car was a mile away, but the snow was deep, slowing every step. I led the way, flashlight beam cutting through the dark, catching flakes that swirled like static. The trees loomed, their branches sagging under the weight. My boots sank with each step, the effort burning my thighs.“You okay?” I called back to Alex, who was lagging behind.“It’s heavy,” he said, his voice tight. “How far do you think we are?”“Halfway, maybe,” I said, but I wasn’t sure. The trail markers—small metal signs nailed to trees—were buried or hidden. The path looked wrong, like the forest had rearranged itself. Shadows shifted in my peripheral vision, and I kept glancing back, expecting to see the lake, but it was gone, swallowed by the storm. My heart raced, a quiet panic creeping in.Then Alex yelped, stumbling hard. He grabbed my arm, nearly pulling me down. “My ankle,” he gasped, wincing as he sank into the snow. “I stepped in a hole or something.”I helped him to a fallen log, my flashlight shaking as I checked his foot. His face was twisted in pain, and he sucked air through his teeth when I touched his ankle. “Can you walk?” I asked, my voice sharper than I meant.“I’ll try,” he said, but when he stood, he limped heavily, leaning on me. The cold was brutal now, seeping through my layers. My toes felt like stones in my boots. I’d read about hypothermia—how it sneaks up, makes you sluggish, confused. Stories of campers found frozen in storms like this flashed through my mind. We couldn’t stop.“We need shelter,” I said, scanning the trees. “Something to wait this out.”Alex nodded, his breath shallow. “Just keep moving.”We pushed on, slower now, his arm over my shoulder. The snow was up to my shins, each step a fight. My flashlight caught a dark shape ahead—a cabin, old and sagging, its wooden walls weathered gray. The windows were dark, one cracked, and the roof was half-covered in snow. It looked abandoned, but it was our only hope.“There,” I pointed, my voice hoarse. “We’ll stop there.”Alex grunted, his face gray with pain. I half-carried him to the door, which creaked as I pushed it open. The air inside was stale, smelling of damp wood and mildew. Dust coated everything—a rickety table, broken chairs, a rusted stove in the corner. Cobwebs hung like curtains, and the floorboards groaned under our weight. I helped Alex to a corner, setting him on the floor against the wall. He shivered, clutching his ankle.“This place is creepy,” he whispered, his eyes darting to the windows. “You sure it’s safe?”“Safer than freezing out there,” I said, trying to sound sure. My hands were numb as I searched for anything to burn. A few logs were stacked by the stove, but they were damp, moss clinging to the bark. I broke a chair, its wood splintering with a crack that echoed in the silence. My matches sparked, but the logs only smoked, the flame weak.“Come on,” I muttered, blowing on the embers. My breath trembled, fear tightening my chest. If we didn’t get warm, we were done. I’d read about campers who didn’t make it—lost in storms, bodies found days later. The thought made my skin crawl.Alex pulled his jacket tighter, his teeth chattering. “What if we don’t make it through the night?”“Don’t talk like that,” I snapped, my voice sharp with fear. “We’re fine. We just need fire.”A low growl cut through the quiet. I froze, the match burning my fingers. It came again, deeper, from outside. Something heavy brushed against the cabin wall, a slow, deliberate scrape. My heart slammed against my ribs. Bears? Wolves? I’d heard stories of animals in these mountains, bold and hungry in the cold. My flashlight beam shook as I aimed it at the window, but the glass was too frosted to see through.“What was that?” Alex’s voice was barely a whisper, his eyes wide.“Shh,” I hissed, grabbing a broken chair leg. I crept to the window, wiping the frost with my sleeve. Shadows moved in the snow, dark shapes that vanished when I blinked. The growling stopped, but the silence was heavier, like something was waiting just out of sight. My pulse thundered, every creak of the cabin making me flinch.“We need to block the door,” I said, dragging the table across the floor. It scraped loudly, the sound jarring in the quiet. Alex helped, wincing as he pushed, his ankle swollen under his boot. We piled chairs on top, barricading the entrance. The stove finally caught, a weak flame flickering, casting long shadows on the walls. I sat close, rubbing my hands, but the cold still clung to my bones. Alex’s face was pale, his eyes darting to the door.“You think it’s gone?” he asked, his voice small.“I don’t know,” I admitted, gripping the chair leg tighter. The wind howled outside, rattling the windows. I kept imagining eyes in the dark, watching us. The cabin felt like a trap, its walls too thin to keep anything out. I checked my phone—no signal, just a blank screen mocking me.Hours dragged on. The fire burned low, and I broke another chair to feed it, the wood splintering in my hands. Alex dozed, his head slumped, but his breathing was uneven, worrying me. I stayed awake, every noise making me jump—a branch snapping, the wind moaning, the faint crunch of snow outside. My mind raced with stories of campers who vanished, their tents found empty, their gear scattered. I shook the thoughts away, focusing on the fire’s weak glow.A sharp knock rattled the door. I jolted, the chair leg raised like a club. “Who’s there?” I called, my voice cracking.“Park ranger!” a voice shouted. “You okay in there?”Relief hit me like a wave, but I was cautious. I moved the table, cracking the door open. A man in a ranger uniform stood there, his flashlight cutting through the snow. His face was weathered, snow dusting his hat and shoulders. “Saw your tracks from the trail,” he said. “Storm’s bad. We need to get you out.”I helped Alex up, his arm heavy over my shoulder. The ranger led us to his truck, parked a half-mile away, its lights a beacon in the dark. The snow was still falling, piling higher, but the truck’s heater blasted warm air as we climbed in. I sank into the seat, my body shaking, not just from the cold but from how close we’d come. Alex leaned against the window, his face still pale but alive.“You’re lucky,” the ranger said, driving slowly through the snow. “People get lost out here every year. Some don’t make it.”I nodded, staring out at the white void. I’d read about those people—campers caught in sudden storms, injured, or worse. We’d been cocky, thinking we were ready for anything. The forest didn’t care about our plans. As the truck rumbled toward safety, I swore I’d never take it for granted again.

  


# ""Frozen Footsteps"":

I’d always loved the outdoors, the way the forest felt alive yet peaceful, but that winter camping trip in the Sierra Nevada in 1983 turned that love into something else—something heavy with fear. My friends, Tom and Lisa, and I had been planning this trip for weeks, craving a break from our routines. We chose a remote spot deep in the mountains, a clearing by a frozen stream about seven miles from the nearest trailhead. We were experienced campers, but winter in the high Sierras was new territory. We packed with care: insulated tents, sleeping bags rated for extreme cold, thermal layers, a small stove, and enough food—dried meals, granola bars, and canned chili—for four days. The drive to the trailhead took hours, winding through narrow roads lined with snow-dusted pines. By the time we parked, the sky was turning gray, and we shouldered our heavy packs for the long hike in.The trail was brutal. Snow reached our knees in places, and the weight of our gear made every step a struggle. My boots sank deep, the cold seeping through despite my wool socks. Tom led the way, his breath puffing out in clouds, while Lisa hummed a tune to keep our spirits up. “This better be worth it,” she said, half-laughing, as she tugged her scarf tighter around her face.“It will be,” I replied, though the effort of speaking made my chest ache. “Nothing like a frozen lake to make you feel alive.”We reached the clearing just as the light started to fade. The stream, locked in ice, glinted faintly, and towering pines circled the spot, their branches heavy with snow. We worked fast to set up camp, our fingers stiff as we hammered tent stakes into the frozen ground. Tom built a fire in a cleared patch, the flames crackling as they caught on the dry wood we’d carried in. We sat around it, warming our hands, passing around a thermos of coffee that burned my throat in the best way.“This is perfect,” Lisa said, her face glowing in the firelight. “No phones, no noise—just us.”Tom nodded, poking the fire with a stick. “Yeah, but it’s creepy how quiet it is. No birds, no nothing.”I glanced at the dark tree line, the shadows thick beyond the fire’s reach. “That’s just winter,” I said, trying to sound casual. “Everything’s sleeping.”We ate dinner—chili heated on the stove, the smell rich and comforting—and planned the next day’s hike to a nearby ridge with a view of the valley. The cold pressed in as the fire died down, so we crawled into the tent, zipping ourselves into our sleeping bags. The ground was hard beneath me, and I could feel the cold through the tent floor, but exhaustion pulled me under fast.I woke in the dead of night, my heart racing before I even knew why. A sound had jolted me—a sharp crack, like a branch snapping under weight. I lay still, holding my breath, listening. Another crack, closer, followed by a slow, deliberate crunch in the snow. Footsteps. My skin prickled. We were miles from any road, deep in the wilderness. No one should be out here.I nudged Tom, my voice a whisper. “Wake up. Something’s outside.”He stirred, mumbling, “What time is it?”“Shh. Listen,” I said, my eyes fixed on the tent wall.The crunching came again, circling slowly around us. Lisa sat up, clutching her sleeping bag. “What is that?” she whispered, her voice trembling.“Footsteps,” I said. “Someone’s out there.”Tom’s eyes widened. “You sure it’s not an animal?”Then we heard it—a low, guttural sound, like someone muttering under their breath, just beyond the tent. My stomach dropped. Animals didn’t mutter. I grabbed the flashlight, my hands shaking as I fumbled with the zipper. “Stay here,” I told them, stepping out into the night.The cold hit me like a wall, my breath catching in my throat. The flashlight beam swept across the snow, catching the glint of ice on the stream and the dark shapes of trees. The fire was down to embers, casting a faint red glow. I stood frozen, listening, but the footsteps had stopped. The forest was silent, too silent, the kind of quiet that feels like it’s holding its breath.Tom poked his head out. “See anything?”“Nothing,” I said, my voice low. “But I heard it. We all did.”Lisa joined us, her jacket pulled tight. “That wasn’t an animal,” she said. “Animals don’t sound like that.”We circled the tent, our flashlights cutting through the dark. The snow around us was smooth except for our own tracks from earlier. No footprints, no signs of anyone. “Maybe it was the wind,” Tom said, but his voice was unsteady.“Wind doesn’t throw rocks,” I muttered, still scanning the trees.We went back inside, zipping the tent tight. None of us slept much after that. Every creak of the pines, every shift of snow, made my heart jump. I kept the flashlight clutched in my hand, ready to bolt.Morning came, gray and heavy. We tried to shake off the fear, blaming it on tired minds and the strangeness of the wilderness. After breakfast—granola bars and instant coffee—we hiked along the stream toward the ridge. The forest was stunning, the snow sparkling under the weak light, but I couldn’t relax. I kept looking over my shoulder, feeling like something was watching us from the trees. During a break, Lisa stopped, staring at a distant slope. “There,” she said, pointing. “Something moved.”I followed her gaze, squinting through the pines. “I don’t see anything.”“It was fast,” she said, her voice tight. “Like a shadow, darting between the trees.”Tom frowned, adjusting his hat. “Could’ve been a deer. Let’s just keep moving.”But I saw the worry in his eyes. We stayed close, our conversation fading as we trudged on. The ridge offered a breathtaking view—snow-covered peaks stretching into the distance—but the unease lingered, like a weight in my chest.That night, we built the fire bigger, piling on extra wood until the flames roared. We sat close, eating in silence, the crackle of the fire the only sound. I kept my flashlight in my lap, my eyes darting to the darkness beyond. Then, out of nowhere, a rock landed in the snow just outside the fire’s glow. We froze, staring at the spot where it hit. Another rock followed, thudding closer, kicking up a spray of snow near Lisa’s boots. She gasped, scrambling back.“Who’s there?” Tom yelled, jumping up, his flashlight sweeping the trees.No answer. Just the echo of his voice fading into the night. My heart pounded as I grabbed a burning stick from the fire, its end glowing red. “We need to leave,” I said, my voice shaking. “Right now.”“We can’t hike in the dark,” Lisa said, her eyes wide. “The trail’s too rough.”“Staying here is worse,” I shot back. “You heard that. Someone’s out there.”Another rock sailed from the darkness, landing in the fire with a burst of sparks. That was it. We tore down the tent, our hands fumbling with the stakes and poles. I kept my flashlight trained on the trees, expecting a figure to step out at any moment. The cold made my fingers clumsy, but fear kept us moving. We stuffed our gear into our packs, not caring if things were neat, and started the hike back to the trailhead.The path was a nightmare in the dark. Snow hid roots and rocks, and we stumbled often, our heavy packs pulling us off balance. Behind us, those deliberate footsteps crunched, matching our pace. I swung my flashlight back, the beam shaking in my hand, but it showed nothing—just endless trees and snow. “Keep going,” I said, my voice barely audible over my pounding heart.“Do you still hear it?” Lisa asked, her breath coming in short, panicked gasps.“Yeah,” Tom said, his voice low. “It’s still there.”The footsteps followed us for miles, never closer but never stopping. My legs burned, my lungs aching from the cold air. Branches snagged at my jacket, and every shadow looked like a person waiting to jump out. I kept thinking about how far we were from help, how no one would hear us scream out here.Finally, after what felt like forever, the trailhead appeared. Our car sat under a thick layer of snow, a dark shape in the moonlight. We threw our packs in the trunk, piling into the front seat together for warmth. Tom fumbled with the keys, cursing under his breath as the engine sputtered before roaring to life. As we pulled away, I looked back, my flashlight aimed at the trail. For a moment, I swore I saw a figure—tall, motionless, standing just at the edge of the trees. Then the beam shifted, and it was gone.We drove in silence for a long time, the hum of the engine the only sound. Lisa finally spoke, her voice small. “What was that? A person?”“I don’t know,” I said, staring out the window at the passing pines. “Maybe someone lives out there, doesn’t like campers. Or maybe they were just toying with us.”Tom gripped the wheel tighter. “Could’ve been a hunter, someone messed up in the head. There’s weird people in these mountains.”When we reached town, we went straight to the ranger station. The ranger, an older guy with a weathered face, listened to our story, scribbling notes. “Could’ve been a recluse,” he said. “Some folks live off-grid out there, don’t take kindly to strangers. Or maybe kids pulling a prank. We’ll check it out, but that forest’s huge. Hard to find anyone who doesn’t want to be found.”He asked if we’d seen anyone, any details about the figure. I told him about the shadow at the trailhead, but it felt flimsy, like a dream I wasn’t sure of. He nodded, promising to send a patrol, but I could tell he didn’t expect to find much.That trip haunts me. I haven’t gone camping since, not even in summer. At night, I still hear those footsteps in my head, the slow crunch in the snow, the low mutter just outside the tent. I think about that figure at the trailhead, wondering who they were, what they wanted. Were they watching us the whole time, waiting for us to leave? Or was it something worse, someone with darker plans? The mountains keep their secrets, and I’m not sure I want to know the truth. All I know is I’ll never feel safe in the wilderness again.",1,1748949245.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

A Reluctant Sissy -- Part 1 -- Arrival

 It was just about two years ago that I finally decided that I had had enough!  I am a single mother and my son was completely out of control.  I didn't really care that he was a crossdressing sissy.  I didn't like him getting into my lingerie and make-up and dresses and shoes every time my back was turned.  But I could have lived with that.  There were other problems -- real problems.  He was close to failing out of school, he was getting into all sorts of drugs, and I was spending a fortune getting him out of trouble with the police for his non-stop shoplifting.

 There were endless meetings with his teachers and counselors at school.  But they had no answers.  I tried family therapists, but they were useless.  I tried grounding him and every other form of punishment I could think of.  Nothing worked.

 And then he stole several pieces of my jewelry and tried to pawn them. That was the last straw!

 I remember reading somewhere that there was a Ms. Trainer who ran a service where she could improve the behavior of boys through feminization.  It wasn't easy to track her down, but I did.  I discussed my situation with her and she was very reassuring.  She explained that since my son was already a crossdressing sissy, her techniques should work very effectively on him.  She suggested that I send him to her new facility inLondon, where the staff and the process were extremely strict and effective.  A new semester was just about to start and there was one opening (they handle up to six sissies at a time).  I considered this to be a real opportunity so I wasted no time at all in doing what she suggested.

 Imagine my son's surprise when we arrived at Ms. Trainer's estate outside ofLondon.  My son thought I had taken him toLondonso he could go pubbing and what not. You should have seen the look on his face when we pulled up the driveway and two enormous orderlies roughly grabbed him and dragged him out of the car and into the house!

After an initial period of six weeks, during which I had heard nothing about my son's progress, I received my first report from school -- complete with lots of photos!  Let me share their letter with you:

 ""Dear Mrs. \_\_\_,

 We are happy to report that your son has made good progress during his first six weeks with us.  We have decided to call him ""Kimberly"" -- we hope that name is satisfactory to you. He is settling into our routine of continuous training, behavior modification, and positive and negative reinforcement. There is evidence that we are starting to strip away his awful self-destructive behavior and replace it with a gentler, more compliant, feminized version of himself.  Enclosed please find several photos of how your son is dressed everyday here at the facility.  He really makes an adorable sissy!""

 I stopped reading to marvel at the enclosed photos.  I was stunned by just how lovely my son looked in his pretty new dresses.  He had become so skinny in just a few weeks.  And his hair was dyed such a pretty shade of blonde.  His make-up, his jewelry, his sky-high heels -- everything was just so perfect and dainty and feminine.  I could barely believe my eyes.

 The letter continued:

 ""Of course, even though we know he is a sissy at heart, he is resisting the feminization process.  This is normal and not a cause for concern at this early stage.  As you can see, he refuses to smile for our photos. As we remind him daily, we don't care if he is happy or not; he is only succeeding in making his transformation more difficult and more miserable for himself.

 We will keep you posted as our time with your son proceeds.

 Sincerely, Mrs. Trainer""

 A Reluctant Sissy -- Part 2 -- Dinner

 About two weeks after I received my first report on my son's progress at Ms. Trainer'sLondonfacility for enforced feminization and obedience training, I received another update -- with more photos.  Let me share this latest update with you:

""Dear Mrs. \_\_\_\_,                                                                                                                               We wanted to let you know that we are continuing to make good progress with your son's transformation.  As you know, he is rather strong-willed and stubborn - but our staff loves a challenge!  And we have the tools and the experience to break down even the most reluctant sissy.                                                                                                                                                             The enclosed photos show your son dressed for dinner.  Dinner is a rather formal affair here at the facility and we insist that our sissies dress up nightly in an appropriately fancy and feminine manner.  We think your son looks absolutely divine in his dinner dresses.  As you can see, his still refuses to smile for the camera.  He is very unhappy with what we are forcing him to do and he is probably terrified of what the future holds for him.  Regardless, I think he looks simply divine in the nude colored dress and absolutely charming in the green dress""                                                                                                                                               I took a moment to study these latest photos.  I could hardly believe that this lovely creature in the long sleeveless dresses was really my son!  He looked so ladylike, so elegant.  But I certainly did recognize his scowl -- just about the only expression I ever saw him make.  Well, pout as much as you like, sissy boy.  I know you will be no match for Ms. Trainer's staff and their techniques!

 The letter continued:

 ""I understand that you never received much background on our process here at the facility as I know you deposited your son with us with some urgency.  I thought you would enjoy a quick overview of our process. Every day begins at5:00AMsharp and our sissies make themselves pretty for the day.  Then for the next 12 hours, it is non-stop chores and training. We are proud of what wonderful domestic workers our sissy graduates are after hundreds of hours of cleaning and cooking and serving -- all under our most strict supervision, of course. There is intense training on etiquette, deportment, speaking, beauty and other skills expected of sissies (did anyone say massage?)  Training here includes classes led by my wonderful staff, supplemented with subliminal messaging and hypnosis.  We have also begun your son on medically supervised hormone treatment (you will recall signing a release for that.)                                                                                                 I did not share it with you in my prior letter, but we did have to use some rather extreme measures on your son during his first weeks with us.  But we know what we are doing in this area and we were able to get him to understand that he is to be obedient and submissive and cooperative -- or risk a repeat of the punishments he received when he first arrived.                                                                                                    Anyway, those days are behind us now and your lovely sissy son is making wonderful progress.    I will write again soon.  Sincerely, Mrs. Trainer.""

 A Reluctant Sissy -- Part 3 -- Sissies go to Church

 It had only been a week since my last letter when I received another update from Mrs. Trainer on my sissy son's progress at Mrs. Trainer's ""transformation"" academy

 ""Dear Mrs. \_\_\_\_\_,

 All of our sissies, including your pretty son, continue to make wonderful progress.  Of course, there are challenges to overcome, but nobody said it would be easy!

 There is so much activity here at the academy every day and every week.  I know you never had the opportunity to attend our full orientation program for sissy guardians and owners, so I hope my letters will help you get a full picture of all the fun we are having here (well, fun for us. Not so much fun for the sissies!  Ha ha!)

 One lovely tradition we have is that we take all of our sissies to church every Sunday.  The vicar of our local church is quite the pervert and he enjoys getting to know each of our sissy students.  Every week, our sissies get all dolled up in their Sunday finest and we parade them into church, where they all sit in first pew, their dresses and make-up and posture simply perfect.""

 I marveled at the photos Mrs. Trainer sent of my son wearing these adorable, conservative -- but very stylish -- outfits.  The idea of Mrs. Trainer's staff forcing my son into these clothes and then taking him out in public gave me an unexpected shock of excitement. He's even wearing gloves in one photo!  And I simply love the oversized pearl jewelry they have him wearing. 

 And there was that same sad/mad face.  I knew that attending Mrs. Trainer's academy must be torture -- but I also knew that it was for the best.  Besides, he brought it on himself!

 I returned to Mrs. Trainer's letter.

 ""Part of what makes taking our little sissies to church so fun is that the congregation has no idea these are naughty boys all dolled up and in the process of being transformed.  As far as the other churchgoers know, these young ""ladies"" are attending a ""finishing school"" that I run.  And the best part is, while our little sissies serve coffee and cake after the service, all the church ladies make such a fuss over them saying things like, ""How I wish my daughter would act and dress like such a perfect lady,"" or ""I wish my son inLondoncould meet a nice young lady like you.""  This attention makes our little sissies absolutely squirm! For the staff at our school, it is one of the high points of our week.

 I mentioned that our local vicar takes a very keen interest in our sissies.  He is an obese old man who visits our school several times a week to meet with our sissies one-on-one for  ""spiritual development"" counseling.  This always seems to involve our sissies enduring a lot of severe over the knee spanking.  And I'm not sure that there is a lot of praying going on, but our sissies seem to spend a lot of time on their knees when they're with him (wink, wink!)

Rest assured, we are doing a very thorough job on your son.  Don't let that insubordinate sneer on his face worry you; your son is stubborn but I promise he will be as meek and gentle as a baby kitten when he’s returned to you.

 Sincerely, Mrs. Trainer""

 A Reluctant Sissy -- Part 4 - Going intoLondon

I was now getting updates from Mrs. Trainer every couple of weeks regarding my son's feminization transformation.  The latest letter read as follows:

 ""Dear Mrs. \_\_\_\_\_,

 Now that our most recent crop of sissy students has been with us for a couple of months, we have added a fun new activity to their schedules.  Every two weeks we get our little sissies all dolled up to spend a fun day inLondon!  It is so much fun dressing our sissy boys up in the cutest little outfits and to spend an entire day putting them on full display in the busy city.

There is so much to do inLondon; we usually start our day at a chic salon where the sissies can get their hair and nails done.  The ladies at the salon really enjoy working on our naughty boys and ensure that they all look their very prettiest for the rest of their big day out.  We usually do some shopping for dresses and pretty things at a few boutiques or one of the wonderfulLondondepartment stores.  Then it's off to downtown (we call it ""The City"") where we go for lunch at some restaurant crowded with handsome young businessmen.  There is a lot of ogling and leering going on as our sissies try their hardest to ignore all the attention they are getting.  Sometimes a brave young banker will approach one of our tables and try to flirt with one of our sissy-boys.  It's very upsetting for our sissies to realize that they have been so feminized that they have become the objects of desire for real men!""

 I stopped reading for a moment to take a look at the photos that Mrs. Trainer had included.  My heart nearly stopped when I saw the first photo --  my son in a pretty yellow cardigan, chicly belted around his skinny waist. And this was over a blue polka dot pleated skirt that fell just below his knees.  This was finished with towering pair of open-toe pumps and the same oversized pearl jewelry I had seen in earlier photos.  He looked simply amazing.  So stylish.  Simply gorgeous.  But as always, that naughty boy refuses to smile for the camera! 

 I continued reading:

 ""Our day might include a ballet matinee or high tea at a fancy hotel.  You know -- all the things real ladies love to do.  And our sissies are expected to demonstrate their best behavior and participate enthusiastically in whatever activity we dream up for them.

 

Of course, your darling Kimberly is so very pretty that he attracts a lot of attention where ever we go.  Doesn't he look so sweet in the little pink and blue sweater and skirt ensemble he's wearing!?!  He wears this outfit so well that I promise that we will send it home with him when his training and transformation here are over.""

 I looked at the second photo that Mrs. Trainer had enclosed.  It was shocking to see how feminine -- how absolutely lovely -- my rotten son looked.  My mind went into overdrive in that moment, beginning to imagine the new life the two of us would be living when he returned home. 

Mrs. Trainer's letter concluded:

 ""You may have total confidence that we will complete your son's transformation to our very high standards.  You will be delighted with the lovely and feminine and compliant sissy that you will see in just a few short months.

 Sincerely, Mrs. Trainer.""

A Reluctant Sissy -- Part 5 -- Elegant Nights

 When I opened my most recent update letter from Mrs. Trainer, these two photos fell out of the envelope.  I must have stared at them for five whole minutes before I could tear myself away from them to read her letter to me.

 ""Dear Mrs. \_\_\_\_,

 I am very pleased to report that our progress with your son is proceeding very, very well.  An entirely new personality is being revealed; One that is demure, gentle and obedient.  I am sure you will be delighted when you see the finished product in just a few short months from now.

 Now that our sissy students have been with us for 16 weeks, the intensity of the training and our expectations of our ""ladies"" increases quite dramatically.  Days are longer, infractions are dealt with more severely and our behavior and personality manipulation (some might call it brainwashing) is taken to a new level.

 We are very fortunate that our school is located just a few miles from a Royal Air Force base.  Over time, we have developed a relationship with a select group of senior officers from the base that we can trust.  Every Thursday night, we invite our officer friends over for a very swanky party with our darling sissies.  The officers tell their wives that they are working late (seems to happen every Thursday!) and our sissies entertain these handsome gentlemen from early in the evening until well pastmidnight.

  We dress our sissies up in their finest outfits to show the officers how much we appreciate their company.  And it should be no surprise that your little Kimberly is one of the officers' favorites!  The gentlemen arrive -- in full dress uniform, of course -- around6:00pm.  It's cocktails and flirting with the sissies.  Then dinner at8:00followed by more cocktails, dancing and...well, whatever the officers want to do.  We have plenty of space here at the school for the officers to take a sissy somewhere private for some one-on-one time.  This goes on for a few more hours until our gentlemen guests are exhausted and need to head home to their families.

 You may be curious as to why we incorporate some much interaction with men into our training program.  Let me explain.  First, when our sissies are in the presence of alpha males, like our wonderful RAF officers, they are shocked into realizing just how little they have in common with such real men.  Being surrounded by strong, masculine, muscular men, our sissies feel small and delicate and weak.  They recognize nothing of themselves in our handsome guests.

 Second, it is understood by all that the sissies are to cooperate with and please our guests at all times.  Our officers are accustomed to having their instruction followed and their needs met.  It is wonderful practice for our sissies to understand that their role is only to please and to serve.  At this point in their training, they are beginning to feel a sense of fulfillment, and even pride, in their submissiveness and servitude to these strong, dominant men.

 I will write again with more photos as soon as I can.

 Sincerely, Mrs. Trainer""

 I put away Mrs. Trainer's letter and again marveled at the photos of my beautiful, elegant, ladylike son.  I could just imagine how these older gentlemen would absolutely drool at the site of such a lovely young ""girl.""  And while at first I was shocked by the thought of him being forced to endure...encounters...with men, I could see Mrs. Trainer's point that it was probably a very powerful indoctrination and re-education tool.  I reminded myself of just how bad his behavior was before I sent him away and how I was in favor of whatever Mrs. Trainer felt she needed to do to fix his awful behavior and attitude.

 A Reluctant Sissy -- Part 6 - Sissies for Hire

About a month had passed before I received another letter from Mrs. Trainer.

 ""Dear Mrs. \_\_\_\_,

 Sorry for the delay in writing but things here at the school are very busy indeed.  This is a crucial time in our training process where we expect to see our sissies display the attitude and actions that are expected of them without any reminders, prodding or punishment.  We are still enjoying our trips intoLondonand our Thursday night officers' parties.  And I am delighted to report that your son is by far the best behaved, hardest working, most delightful little sissy in the entire class.  We are absolutely thrilled with how far he has come in just five short months here.

 There is a special privilege (well, I 'm not sure the sissies see it as a privilege) that we reserve for our most accomplished, most feminized, most obedient sissies.  On occasion, if one (or more) of our handsome, older Air Force officers wants to ""borrow"" a sissy, that is something we can sometimes arrange.  Well, I can assure you that ALL of the gentlemen are asking for time with your beautiful son.

 Sometimes an officer will request a sissy to be their date for an evening of dining and clubbing inLondon.  Your Kimberly  went on such a date two weeks ago wearing that adorable black minidress.  Doesn't he look divine.  Our officer was so proud having this lovely sissy hanging on his arm all evening, showing him off to all his friends.""                                                                                                               I stopped reading long enough to look at the first photo.  I nearly fainted at the sight of my son wearing a very sexy minidress -- and looking amazing in it.  He looked so delicate, so feminine.  The short dress made his legs look so long and slender, the high heels he wore added to the effect.   I took a breath and returned to the letter.

 ""Then last week, another officer borrowed Kimberly for an entire weekend, jetting him off to some swanky island resort.  We assembled some fabulous outfits for your son for this little adventure.  I simply love the very revealing black top combined with the wide leg trousers.  Your son looks like he stepped out of a fashion magazine!  And the fun part of wearing that top - it makes our sissies wish that their boobs were actually larger than they are (but the hormones only work so fast -- don't worry, you can expect a lot more progress in this department over the months ahead).  We also sent your son off with a sexy swimsuit for his resort getaway.""

 I stopped again to look at these two photos.....

 ""And please don't be concerned by the expression on Kimberly's face.  I'm happy to report that he is not sneering or frowning for the camera.  Rather, he is genuinely frightened of being sent away for time alone with these men.  As awful as life is for our sissies in the school, they become familiar with their surroundings and the routine and they take comfort in that.  But when they are sent off into the world on their own, with no chaperone, that can be very unsettling.  Your lovely Kimberly was absolutely trembling with fear before being sent off on these two ""assignments.""                                                                                                                But I'm happy to tell you that in both instances our officer friends were absolutely delighted with Kimberly's company! 

There is a group of three officers who have inquired as to whether they could take Kimberly away for a weekend at a country estate they are renting.  I think that sounds like a marvelous idea.  I'm sure they will find all sorts of ways to keep your darling son busy! 

 I expect that there will be some sad faces over at the base when it's time for your Kimberly to be sent home to you.

 That's all for now.  We are in the final stages of preparing your son to go home to you!

 Sincerely, Mrs. Trainer""

 A Reluctant Sissy -- Part 7 -- Going Home

It had been nearly six months since I had deposited my rotten, trouble-making son at Mrs. Trainer's ""academy"" outside ofLondonwhen I received this letter from her:

 ""Dear Mrs. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 The big day has finally arrived!  Your son has graduated from our sissy transformation program and I know you will be absolutely delighted with the results.

 Your darling Kimberly is prepared to be obedient and submissive to you in every way.  I would urge you to begin thinking hard about how you will incorporate Kimberly into your life at home.  I'm sure you are already thinking about how Kimberly will take care of all the household chores -- cleaning, cooking, laundry, ironing, etc.  But there is so much more you can expect from your new sissy.  Your sissy exists only to enhance your life in every way imaginable.  Get creative.  Your sissy can serve you breakfast in bed or massage your feet while you are eating lunch (that he has prepared and served you). Your sissy can bathe and dress you --- there is no point being modest around your sissy; it is best to think of your sissy as an extension of yourself.  Your sissy can tidy up after you have enjoyed time with your lover.""

 I stopped reading for a moment to let Mrs. Trainer's words sink in.  Having Kimberly bathe and dress me...? I hadn't thought of that, but it gave me a tingle just thinking about it.  And it had been years since I had experienced a lover -- and all because I was constantly dealing with my son's misbehavior.  Well, that would certainly be fair -- making Kimberly tidy up after I'm done having sex with a man since he prevented me from having any romantic relationships for so long.

 I returned to the letter.

 ""It is important to keep your sissy busy and on a strict schedule at all times.  For many of our clients, sissy bedtime (I we mean lights-out!) is8:30pm, with wake-up at4:30am.  That gives your sissy 90 minutes to prepare themselves for the day and make themselves look lovely for you, and another hour to prepare the house and breakfast for you by7:00am.  Of course you will establish whatever schedule best suits you.

And PLEASE, do not miss opportunities to punish and berate your sissy.  The smallest mistake or infraction (even if you have to make it up!) should be dealt with severely.  Over the knee spankings are very effective (always use a hairbrush to protect your hands) and scolding is always appropriate.  Reminding Kimberly frequently that he is a pathetic, weak, stupid, worthless sissy is very beneficial.

 We will be putting Kimberly on a plane home to you in just seven days from now.  We will send several cases of clothes and other items that Kimberly will need.  We will also send along our sissy owners manual that is filled with useful tips for getting the most from your new sissy.

 Enjoy the photo enclosed.  We are having Kimberly model the outfit that he will wear on the plane ride home to you.  This is what he will look like when you see him next week at the airport.  Isn't this marvelous.  So beautiful and so impractical!  He will certainly get plenty of attention during his journey home.

 All of us here at the Academy have been delighted to work with your son.  We are very pleased with the changes we were able to make in him.

 We are always here for you if you need us in the future.

 Regards, Mrs. Trainer""

 A Reluctant Sissy -- Part 8 -- A Letter to Mrs. Trainer

It had been about a month since Kimberly was returned home to me and I decided to write a letter to Mrs. Trainer.

 ""Dear Mrs. Trainer,

 I can't believe it has already been four weeks since my Kimberly was returned to me.  I can not thank you enough for the dramatic improvements you made to my son's attitude and behavior.  I am so happy to report that he has been an absolute DELIGHT since I picked him up at the airport.

 Let me fill you in on some details.

 When Kimberly arrived at the International Terminal, he was dressed just as you had promised -- in that adorable cream colored two piece outfit with the belted top and the pleated skirt. And those beautiful high heeled shoes.  If you hadn't prepared me by sending the photo to be ahead of time, I would have fainted seeing how beautiful he looked!  Anyway, as he stepped off the gateway, he walked right up to me, eyes pointed down to my shoes, and he curtsied!  He actually curtsied to me right there in the airport!  He thanked me for sending him to your school and promised that he would never disappoint or disobey me ever again.  I told him that a new life awaited for him at home and off we went.                                                                                  When we arrived home, I showed him to his room which had been completely redecorated since he left.  There was no trace of his past life.  All the furniture was white and there were lacy curtains over the windows. The drawers and closets were already full of his lingerie and dresses and shoes and all the lovely outfits you had shipped to me before he arrived. And of course there was a vanity table and mirror for him to do his hair and make-up.

 As you suggested, I wasted no time getting Kimberly introduced to his new schedule and responsibilities.  He is so wonderful at following directions -- I only have to tell him to do things once and he immediately gets busy fulfilling my every need.  Of course that includes all the cooking and cleaning.  But I also have him bathe me every evening -- that was quite an experience the first time for both of us!  I'm sure others would find it quite shocking for me to be naked and bathed by my former son.  But there is nothing sexual about it.  I know it sends a powerful message about who is in charge and who is subservient.

Also, per your instructions, I arranged for Kimberly to ""make amends"" for all the past trouble he had caused and believe me, that was a very long list indeed.  I had Kimberly dress in the outfit pictured here.  I know he hated it but he said nothing.  Just look it him!  That dress is ridiculous -- and just perfect for what I had planned.                                                                             About two weeks ago, I had Kimberly put on this outfit.  He knew something was up as soon as he put it on!  And off we went to downtown.  I made a list of every store that he had shoplifted from and we went to each one.  Kimberly went in, curtseyed to the manager and asked for forgiveness for is past misbehavior.  People in the store watching this couldn't believe their eyes.  Most had no idea what they were witnessing -- this absurdly dressed young women, fighting back tears as she (he) begged for forgiveness!  It was wonderful!.

 But the best part came next.  After visiting about a dozen stores downtown and several more at the mall -- we went to the high school next!  As you said, there is no reason for Kimberly to ever return to school -- he learned everything he will ever need to know at your training academy.  But Kimberly needed to make amends to many teachers and administrators at the school for all the trouble he had caused.  So there we were -- for a couple of hours.  Walking the hallways, going room to room, office to office, curtseying and apologizing to every teacher and every administrator that had been subject to his misbehavior.  And of course, only a million of his classmates saw him as we walked through the busy hallways.  There were many giggles, much pointing and quite a few ""salty"" comments from some of his former classmates.  Well that experience was traumatic for Kimberly to say the least.  He was in tears before we were even half through our rounds!

 Anyway, life is wonderful with my new and improved Kimberly.  Thank you for saving him and returning him to me.  It was for the best -- especially for him.

 Yours,   Mrs. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_""",1,1748949173.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

Immediate Tradent allows you to **set alerts for specific trading conditions**. Want to get notified when BTC hits $50K or when a trade completes? You can customize alerts via SMS or email.

This keeps you in the loop without needing to stay glued to the screen.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Besides crypto, you can also trade **forex, stocks, and commodities**. This makes it a more versatile platform than others that focus only on Bitcoin or Ethereum.

It’s ideal for people who want to **diversify their trading portfolio** without switching between platforms.

## Is Immediate Tradent a Scam?

Nope, Immediate Tradent doesn’t appear to be a scam.

It offers real-time trading, demo accounts, works with regulated brokers, and doesn’t make wild claims like “get rich overnight.” That’s a green flag in my book.

However, like with any investment platform, there's **always risk**, and you should only invest what you can afford to lose. Also, since the creators are anonymous, it’s wise to approach with realistic expectations.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Immediate Tradent?

To start trading, you’ll need to deposit **at least $250**.

This is pretty standard across platforms like this, but I get that it might be a bit much for some folks. The good news? You can use the **demo account** to test the waters before committing real money.

### Immediate Tradent Customer Support

Support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I tested the chat feature and got a human reply within a few minutes, which is faster than many other platforms I’ve tried.

They’re helpful with technical issues, account questions, and even basic trading tips.

## How do you start trading on Immediate Tradent?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the Immediate Tradent website and fill in your **name, email, and phone number**. It takes less than 2 minutes.

Once you're in, you'll be connected with a **partner broker** who will handle the trades.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You’ll need to **verify your ID** to comply with broker regulations. Upload your ID and proof of address—it’s standard KYC stuff.

Then, make your first deposit (minimum $250) using **credit card, debit card, bank transfer, or crypto**.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once your account is funded, you can switch on the trading bot, or try demo mode first. Either way, the platform starts scanning the market and placing trades based on the algorithm.

You can monitor everything from your dashboard and even tweak your risk settings.

## How to Delete an Immediate Tradent Account?

If you decide you want out, just **contact customer support** and request account deletion. It usually takes 24-48 hours.

Make sure you **withdraw any remaining funds** before closing the account.

## The Verdict

If you’re looking for a simple, beginner-friendly way to dip your toes into crypto or forex trading, **Immediate Tradent is a solid option**.

It’s not going to make you a millionaire overnight (nothing will, really), but it takes the complexity out of trading and gives you **a smart tool to help manage risk and opportunity**.

The lack of a mobile app and the $250 deposit might be drawbacks, but the platform makes up for it with ease of use, speed, and reliability. For folks who want to learn the ropes or start trading passively, I’d say it’s definitely worth checking out.

**My big question:** What essential appliances should I prioritize to make life on the road easier and more comfortable? Like, besides a fridge and stove, are there gadgets that make a huge difference? Space-saving options? Things I might not even think of yet?

If you’ve been researching places to live in Panama, chances are you’ve already heard of Boquete—and maybe even its quieter cousin, Volcán. Both towns sit in the cool, green highlands of Chiriquí Province and have long been favorites among expats. But are they still the dream destinations they’re made out to be?

Here’s a breakdown of what to expect, who these towns are best suited for, and what to consider before making the move.

🧭 TL;DR
Boquete and Volcán are two of Panama’s most popular highland towns for expats. Boquete is vibrant, social, and well-developed, while Volcán is quieter, more rural, and more affordable. Both offer cool weather, mountain views, and strong expat communities—but also rising costs, limited nightlife, and a slower pace of life.

🌄 Why Boquete & Volcán Appeal to Expats
* Cooler climate – Year-round spring-like temperatures in the 60s–70s °F
* Stunning scenery – Cloud forests, coffee farms, rivers, and views of Volcán Barú
* Outdoor lifestyle – Hiking, birdwatching, gardening, and adventure sports
* Established expat communities – Especially in Boquete, with clubs, meetups, and events
* Healthcare access – David (the provincial capital) is about 30–45 minutes away with good hospitals
* Safe and peaceful – Low crime and a strong sense of community

🎉 Culture & Community Life
While both towns are relatively small, they each have their own rhythm and cultural flavor:

**Boquete**
* Feria de las Flores y del Café – A major flower and coffee fair held every January, drawing visitors from across Panama
* Tuesday Market – A popular weekly event where locals and expats sell crafts, produce, and baked goods
* Live music & art – Boquete has a growing arts scene, with galleries, concerts, and theater performances
* Volunteer opportunities – Many expats get involved in local charities, animal rescues, and education programs
* Cafés and restaurants – A wide range of international and local cuisine, especially for a town its size

**Volcán**
* More rural and traditional – Fewer tourists, more local flavor
* Agricultural hub – Known for its farms, cattle, and fresh produce
* Quiet community life – Less nightlife, but a strong sense of neighborliness
* Access to nature – Close to La Amistad International Park and hiking trails

🏘️ Where Expats Tend to Live
* Boquete Town Center – Walkable, social, and close to shops and restaurants
* Alto Boquete – A bit more suburban, with larger homes and mountain views
* Jaramillo & Volcancito – Hillside areas with cooler temps and more privacy
* Volcán Town – Compact and quiet, with basic services and a few expat-friendly cafés
* Cerro Punta – Even higher elevation, very rural, and great for gardening or off-grid living

💰 Cost of Living (Estimates)
* Rent in Boquete: $700–$1,500/month
* Rent in Volcán: $400–$900/month
* Utilities: $50–$150/month (no A/C needed)
* Dining out: $6–$20 per meal
* Groceries: Local produce is cheap; imported goods are pricier
* Transportation: Most people drive; taxis and buses are available

✅ Pros
* Comfortable climate year-round
* Beautiful natural surroundings
* Strong, supportive expat communities
* Safe and walkable towns
* Access to healthcare in nearby David
* Great for gardening, hiking, and outdoor living

❌ Cons
* Boquete is getting more expensive and touristy
* Volcán has fewer services and slower development
* Limited nightlife and entertainment
* Internet can be spotty in rural areas
* Some areas are hilly and not very walkable
* Language barrier if you don’t speak Spanish (especially in Volcán)

👥 Who These Towns Are Best For
* Retirees looking for comfort, safety, and community
* Nature lovers and outdoor enthusiasts
* Remote workers who don’t need blazing-fast internet
* Families seeking a peaceful, small-town environment
* Expats who want to integrate with locals and live simply

🧳 Final Thoughts
Boquete and Volcán each offer a unique version of highland living in Panama. Boquete is more developed, social, and active—great if you want amenities and community. Volcán is quieter, more affordable, and more traditional—ideal if you’re looking for space, simplicity, and a slower pace.

In particular, I have an INFJ coworker who shows up in my office at least twice a day just for the vibes or for my opinion on something. 

The other day I noticed a male figure walking past my office and pausing right at my door,  checking his phone. With my eyes still glued to my computer, I assumed it was the INFJ so - possibly due to my low Se - I turned to him with the brightest smile and said ‘Hi!!’, just like someone greeting his best friend. 😩

Plot twist: my intuition failed me this time, it was NOT him. It was a completely different guy from another team I’d never spoken to in my life. His eyes widened and he shot back a ‘Hey!’ with equal energy and left. 

Since then, I’ve started noticing this guy’s presence near my office one too many times to be a coincidence. 
I didn’t give this too much attention until I received a message in the work chat today, from him ‘Hey! Want to grab a coffee sometime?’. 🚨 

I want to evaporate. Do tell me what to do? I have no time machine and I feel bad coming across like the villain now and telling him my initial ‘Hi’ was not some lowkey green light for dating and was actually meant for someone else too… 😹

We're chatting with the driver (as one does) and my husband just ends up not continuing his side of the convo (thought the driver did ask him a question and tried to keep open that communication, though he gave in after a very short response from my husband. 

I'm just here thinking he got bored or had a headache, sometimes he just gets bored and leaves me talking with him just kind of there for a while. Happens all the time, actually!

He's squeezing my hand while I'm talking to the guy, which we do as an affectionate thing, so I think nothing of it! After we got to the place, my husband asks for my phone, which I hand over, then he gives the poor driver a terrible review and even reported him!!

I was beyond confused because it seemed like a nice ride? Like it felt safe and he was a good driver (I can't drive so I've seen a lot where the driving makes me feel scared), so I couldn't understand. 

He got pissy with me and told me to go sort ""your"" car out and he'll stay outside. I asked if he wanted a coffee while we waited for the finance office to open (later than Google made it seem). He just told me to make a coffee for ""your pretty driver"". 

After he calmed down he said that I was disrespectful because I spoke with the driver and had an actual conversation even though my husband was there. 

My dad later told me it's probably a cultural difference, but it's still bothering me even now.

1l28umh,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiKitchenGear/comments/1l28umh/the_lazy_persons_survival_manual_tactical/,The Lazy Person’s Survival Manual: Tactical Cleaning for the Terminally Unmotivated,"Welcome to the deep-cleaning gospel for people who can barely muster the energy to wipe a countertop without wanting to burn the house down. If you've ever cleaned the same damn spot three times in a week and thought, *Why even bother?*, this guide is for you. It's not about turning you into some Pinterest-ready neat freak.... it’s about weaponizing your laziness into cleaning efficiency.

# Why Cleaning Sucks

Let’s get real: cleaning is the Sisyphean punishment of adult life. You scrub today, it mocks you tomorrow. The cycle never ends. So you either:

* Cry.
* Burn your house down.
* Or learn to do the absolute **minimum** to avoid living in a biohazard zone.

Why it *still* matters, even if it sucks:

|Problem|Effect on You|Result|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Cluttered counters|Visual chaos, decision fatigue|Paralysis and takeout… again|
|Dirty floors|Gross feet and dirt on your socks|Rage and resentment|
|Sink full of dishes|Insects and shame|Avoidance spiral|
|Messy bathroom|Embarrassment and mildew|Closed-door policy on guests|

So yeah, cleaning sucks. But so does living in the aftermath of not cleaning.

# Drawer Sorcery

This is not a drill: **drawers are magic**. Drawers, baskets, boxesanything with a lid or flap that hides your shame. You don’t need organization; you need containment.

|Room|Must-Have Drawer Contents|Suggested Container|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Kitchen|Loose utensils, tape, soy sauce packets|IKEA drawer dividers or junk drawer bins|
|Bathroom|Random skincare, nail clippers, expired toothpaste|Under-sink baskets|
|Living Room|Chargers, remotes, mystery screws|Woven or cloth bins|
|Bedroom|Socks without partners, batteries, receipts|Drawer organizers or pretty boxes|

**Rule**: If you have to think more than 3 seconds about where something goes... **shove it in the drawer**.

**Pro Tips:**

* Label it “Miscellaneous” and never question it again.
* Every few months, gut the drawer and scream into the void. Toss half of it.

# Localized Weapons

Don’t make cleaning a pilgrimage. You’re lazy. Embrace it. **Keep your tools where the action happens**.

|Location|Essentials|Why|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Bathroom|All-purpose cleaner, Windex, microfiber cloth, toilet brush|Immediate cleanup of toothpaste globs|
|Kitchen|Degreaser, dish soap, sponge, towel|Food messes wait for no one|
|Living Room|Dust cloth, lint roller, small vacuum|Cheeto dust strikes fast|
|Bedroom|Wipes, handheld vacuum|Hair and crumbs happen|

**Pro Tips:**

* Use refillable bottles to avoid the “but I ran out” excuse.
* Buy a cute caddy or hide it in a basket. Shame-free laziness.

# The Timer Trap

Here’s the Jedi trick: Tell your brain you’ll only clean for 10 minutes. Your brain, being an idiot, believes you. Then, surprise.... momentum kicks in and you do more.

|Time Set|Suggested Task|Result|
|:-|:-|:-|
|5 mins|Wipe counters, gather laundry|You feel accomplished|
|10 mins|Tidy bedroom, do dishes|Suddenly you're Martha Stewart|
|15 mins|Bathroom blitz|Nobody will know you’re a slob|

**Combo it with:** music, a podcast, or irrational rage to finish.

# “Good Enough” Philosophy

The perfectionist mindset is the biggest cleaning scam of all time.

|Situation|Lazy Fix|Is it Enough?|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Streaky mirror|Wipe with a sock, no rinse|Yes. It’s fine. Stop staring.|
|Dusty shelf|Swipe with your hand|Absolutely yes|
|Floors|Vacuum visible stuff only|Perfection is a prison|

**Mind Trick**: Dim the lights, light a candle, and poof—your house is 80% cleaner by illusion.

# Cleaning Is a Vibe

Don’t just clean.... **vibe while you clean**.

|Add This|Why It Works|
|:-|:-|
|Music playlist|You’ll dance your way into wiping down the fridge|
|Audiobook|Distracted brain = sneaky productivity|
|Wine|Scrubbing the sink while tipsy feels like less betrayal|
|Family participation|Turn chores into a “team-building exercise” (read: forced labor)|

**Lazy Bonus**: Use wireless earbuds so you don’t get tangled in the vacuum cord like a domestic hostage.

# Own Less Crap

You know what’s easier than organizing? **Not having it**.

|What to Declutter|How to Dispose|Why It's Magic|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Clothes you hate|Donate, rag bag|Less laundry, more closet space|
|Expired stuff|Trash|No regrets, just empty shelves|
|Duplicates|Sell, donate|One of everything = sanity|

**""Useful and Beautiful"" Rule**: If it’s neither, it’s garbage.

# Micro-Cleans

You’ve got downtime. Exploit it like a capitalist overlord.

|Moment|What to Clean|
|:-|:-|
|Microwave time|Wipe counter|
|On hold|Dust bookshelf|
|Commercial breaks|Tidy coffee table|
|Boiling water|Sweep a corner|

Keep a “hit list” of quick 2-minute tasks so you don’t stand there scrolling Instagram instead.

# Basket Cult

If drawers are first-line defense, **baskets are ground control**.

|Basket Type|What It Hides|Where to Put It|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Small decorative|Chargers, keys, receipts|Entry table|
|Medium-sized|Toys, books, shoes|Living room|
|Bathroom|Extra toilet paper, toiletries|Under the sink|
|Labelled bins|Kid stuff, electronics, junk|Everywhere|

**Pro Tip**: Call it “zoning.” Sounds better than “lazy stash points.”

# Task-Based Warfare

**Cleaning by task > cleaning by room**. Doing one job across the whole house builds rhythm. No more sidetracking.

|Task|Path of Attack|
|:-|:-|
|Dusting|Top to bottom, room to room|
|Vacuuming|Hallways last (track dirt as you go)|
|Wiping|All counters first, then tables, then mirrors|

**Momentum tip**: Start with the most visible filth for maximum satisfaction early.

# Wait-Time Hacks

You’re standing around anyway. Clean something.

|Waiting For|Task|
|:-|:-|
|Coffee|Wipe stove, organize mugs|
|Pasta|Clean the sink or trash drawer|
|Face mask|Sweep bathroom floor|
|Zoom call start|Declutter desk|

# The “Clean As You Go” Religion

Cleaning now = no mess later. Stop leaving destruction in your wake.

|Action|Habit Replacement|
|:-|:-|
|Spilled something?|Wipe it now|
|Used a dish?|Rinse it now|
|Cluttered room?|Grab 3 things every time you leave it|

**Bathroom Tip**: Wipe the faucet while brushing teeth. Double duty like a boss.

# Separate Cleaning from Tidying

Trying to do both at once is like mixing tequila and regret.

|Step|Task|
|:-|:-|
|1|Tidy: Everything back in its home (drawers, baskets, etc.)|
|2|Clean: Dust, wipe, vacuum now that surfaces are clear|

**Divide and conquer**. You’ll burn out trying to do both in a single push.

# Bonus Hacks

|Hack|Why It’s Brilliant|
|:-|:-|
|Robot vacuum|Set it and forget it. Laziness FTW|
|Disinfectant wipes|Wipe anything in 10 seconds|
|Microfiber cloths|Trap dust without chemicals|
|Laundry basket walk-through|Collect clutter like Pokémon|
|5-min nightly reset|Avoid next-day chaos|
|Delegate|Kids and roommates aren’t freeloaders. Make ‘em work.|

# Mindset for Slackers

Rewire your guilt-ridden brain.

|Mindset Shift|What It Solves|
|:-|:-|
|“Small wins count”|Motivation drought|
|“Less stuff = less work”|Overwhelm|
|“Good enough is good”|Perfectionism|
|“Hire out deep cleans”|Time crisis|

# The Lazy Cleaning Schedule

Minimal effort. Maximum smugness.

|Day|Task|
|:-|:-|
|Monday|10-min kitchen sweep|
|Tuesday|Tidy one room (with baskets!)|
|Wednesday|Bathroom blitz (mirror, sink, toilet)|
|Thursday|Dust one room|
|Friday|Vacuum one zone|
|Saturday|20-min podcast|
|Daily|5-min “clean as you go” moment|

# Final Rant

You don’t need a spotless, Instagram-worthy house. You need a home that doesn’t make you scream into a pillow every time you walk in. Use drawers to fake organization, stash baskets like you’re hiding treasure, blast your favorite playlist, and stop believing in the cleaning fairy. She’s dead. You’re all you’ve got.

But you’re also smart, strategic, and now dangerously equipped.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) The Detroit Tigers, the team that's been grinding out wins like they're trying to single-handedly keep the coffee industry afloat. And, honestly, who can blame them? They're on a roll, with six victories in their last seven games, and they're facing off against the Chicago White Sox, who are... well, let's just say they're not exactly setting the world on fire.

The Tigers are sending Jack Flaherty to the mound, who's been looking like a boss lately, and they're facing off against Jonathan Cannon, who's... well, not exactly the most intimidating name in baseball. I mean, it sounds like a character from a bad 80s action movie.

The stats are pretty clear: the Tigers are ranked ninth in batting, on-base percentage, and slugging, with a ninth-ranked OPS of .725 on offense. And their pitching? Fifth in ERA (3.17) and third in WHIP (1.16), with a fifth-ranked batting average against (.226). The White Sox, on the other hand, are... well, let's just say they're not exactly lighting it up.

So, with all that in mind, my best bet for this game is: Detroit Tigers -1.5. The odds are looking good, with a price of 2.1, and I'm feeling pretty confident that the Tigers are going to come out on top. I mean, they've already swept the White Sox in their first home series of the season, and they're looking like a team on a mission.

And, let's be real, the White Sox are 20.5 games behind the Tigers. That's not just a gap, that's a chasm. A canyon. A Grand Canyon-sized hole that the White Sox are going to have to climb out of if they want to even think about competing with the Tigers.

So, yeah, I'm taking the Tigers -1.5. It's a pretty safe bet, if you ask me. The over/under is set at 8.5, but I'm not feeling too strongly about that one either way. The Tigers are just going to come out and crush it, and the White Sox are going to... well, they're going to try their best, but let's be real, they're not exactly the most formidable team in the league.

Detroit Tigers -1.5, baby! That's my pick, and I'm sticking to it.

I don’t use Reddit and I’m horrible with spelling. I’m a new mom so I’m running off of 5 hrs of sleep and 3 cups of coffee so forgive me if I’m everywhere with the story but i don’t know who else I can talk to.

I’m Cheyenne (22F) and I live with my mom(45F) who we’ll call M, My dad (46M) who well call D.  My brother (26M) who well call B, and my second oldest brother (23M) who well call K. 
B and K don’t live with us but visit time to time. 

So last year July 4th I found out I was expecting! Me and my husband were trying for about 3 months before so when we found out we wanted to have a party to celebrate. We decided that instead of a party a baby shower would be more interesting so I decided to have one. 

However- I regret asking my mom in the first place. Fast forward to 8 months-
My mom and I decided to sit down and make decorations, set themes and talk about dates. I don’t remember what made us go off topic but she started talking about motherhood and how all of us came to be. Normally I dont care to hear this stuff but I wanted for the first time in forever to bond with my mom again. 

That’s when she randomly told me she only had me to save my brother who had cancer. 
Yep. I thought it would be something more like “you weren’t planned but we still were excited and loved you anyways.” NOPE LOL. instead she told me word for word “Since K is a half brother B needed a full blooded sibling to get white blood cells from, blood, skin?, etc.” I paused and went “so that means?” At that point I’m slowly putting it together and she finally said “well K couldn’t do spinal taps because he’s a half sibling….so we had you in case he needed something from you like CSF (cerebrospinal fluid).” 

I went quiet. Who even says that to their heavily pregnant daughter but honestly when she said that it all made sense. My mom was never nice to me or my sister, she would make excuses for my brothers behavior (still does) and gave them leniency with them when they did horrible stuff like stole, smoked MJ at school, and fought. When it came to us girls we’d be crucified for not cleaning right, wearing tight stuff or even wanting ANYTHING even if it was clothes. We were 5 and 10 at the time- 

Honestly looking my whole pregnancy she did nothing but scare me about birth. I was super high risk and struggled with eating, I had to the er to get fluids and vitamins via IV every week. I was very under weight and struggling with all my friends ditching me while pregnant. I just wanted to bond with my mom but ever since she told me that I just feel like I completely lost myself. I was the only child out of all 4 to do everything they asked of me right the first time and I STILL can’t get the basics like emotional support. I confronted her and asked why she said that to me knowing how it would affect my mental health badly and  she said “it wasn’t a big deal” and “she loves me now so what’s the point?”. LMFAOOOOO I don’t think she hears herself speak. 

I’m 3 months postpartum and she hasn’t gotten any better. I had to get a postpartum emergency crisis team bc of how bad I’m doing (I told her she doesn’t care nor does my dad). It’s all I think about honestly. Don’t get me wrong I had a healthy handsome baby boy, but as a mother why would you ever tell your child that. Every time I look at him I know I planned him for the right reason but I get sad knowing what I know. 

Idk I’m sorry for the rant lol 
I just wanna know if I’m wrong for being so mad. I’m tired of thinking about it but I’ve genuinely never felt wanted and now every time I talk to her I just feel resentment. So am I wrong for being mad at my mom? ",2,1748947672.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,4,0.75,False

A few days passed. Then a week. The burning was still there.

I didn’t have any discharge. No fever. Just this annoying, hard-to-explain discomfort. I told myself it would go away on its own. But it didn’t.

I went to the doctor. Then another one. They ran some tests. One said maybe it’s prostatitis. Another thought it could be pelvic tension. One test showed Mycoplasma. I got treated, but the burning didn’t stop.

I realized something: there’s no clear path for what we’re dealing with. No single subreddit. No single diagnosis. Sometimes you’re stuck between STIs, prostatitis, pelvic floor dysfunction, or “nothing wrong.”

That’s why I started r/MensUroHealth.

It’s for the in-between. For the “I don’t know what this is, but it sucks” stories.

I’m from Ghana 🇬🇭 — currently surviving on design drafts, AutoCAD zoom-ins, and coffee. I’m a draughtsman by day, a curious creative by night. I mess with 3D modeling, architecture, photography, and learning graphic design too.

I’m here looking for someone cool to swap stories with — the real, unfiltered kind. Not just “what I did today,” but also “why does my cat stare at walls for hours?” (I don’t have a cat, but still curious.)

We can talk about life, culture, dreams, weird snacks, or even do a disposable camera photo swap. Let’s see the world through each other’s eyes!

I got offered this ‘Software Internship’ in Vietnam, so I went for it as I couldn’t find any Canadian ones. 

So i’ve working at this Vietnamese company for two weeks now, but I haven’t written a single line of code. Instead ive been assigned to the production/assembly line. My tasks include assembling product components, testing them using their software (by clicking the ‘Run Test’ button), and recording the results in Excel.

In addition to that I was also asked to make coffee for visiting customers, clean the coffee machine, and clean the air conditioners.

I literally am new to SkyPrivate so I have no idea how it works. But I was like why not, just answer it, I need the money, let's see how this works. So I answered, went on video, he went on video. And I'm like okay, how do I know if I'm getting paid right now?

Of course, he sends me a screenshot ""payment in progress"". Obviously I don't trust these guys, so I'm like, I need to exit the call and see if I got any payment from this at all. We went back and forth about that for at least 3 minutes so it was long enough a payment would show up on the website.

So he ended the call and I looked on the website and $0 earnings.

So my question is, for those who use Teams for SkyPrivate, how do you know who has money on there, and how do you know if you're in a paid call or not?

Jacob locked his office door behind him and stepped into the chill of an early spring evening. The church parking lot was nearly empty, save for a few latecomers, but something restless had pulled him away from the quiet safety of his home.

He was used to order—the steady cadence of sermons shaped by a faith handed down through generations, rooted in tradition and the clear lines it drew around right and wrong. His congregation reflected this well: families who valued hard work, respect for authority, and a skepticism of anything too new or uncertain. Jacob himself wore those values like a well-fitted coat, familiar and reassuring.

But tonight, the weight of unspoken questions pressed on him, heavier than the Sunday Bible study debates or the polite discussions over coffee. He found himself walking without direction, his footsteps carrying him to the edge of town, near an old industrial park where streetlights flickered uncertainly.

There, by a fire burning in a rusty barrel, stood three people.

One was a woman in a simple clerical collar, her expression open but unreadable. Another was an older man, shoulders stooped, eyes distant but attentive. Between them, a quiet figure watched the flames, his hands clasped, silent but steady.

Jacob stopped a few feet away, unsettled by their presence but drawn nonetheless. Hospitality was part of his upbringing—welcoming strangers, offering what little warmth the night could afford. But something about this moment felt different.

The woman’s voice broke the silence first. “The Kingdom of God isn’t what most expect. It isn’t about comfort or certainty, but about upheaval—turning tables and crossing boundaries.”

Jacob nodded slowly, feeling the familiar urge to argue, to explain, to reclaim the narrative. But the older man’s next words stopped him.

“Power is not the currency of grace. I once thought strength meant holding fast to what I knew—now I see it means letting go.”

The quiet man finally spoke, his voice low but sure. “Faith is dangerous. It asks us to risk more than social acceptance or political certainty. It asks us to stand with the forgotten, the outcast, the inconvenient.”

Jacob’s throat tightened. He thought of his sermons—carefully framed messages that comforted, rallied, and reassured. Here was a challenge he had never dared voice aloud. The kind of discipleship that didn’t fit neat categories, that unsettled the foundations of his world.

As the rain began to fall, soft and persistent, Jacob glanced back toward the church steeple rising against the darkening sky. He thought of the story he’d heard as a child—the one where Abraham rose quickly to welcome three strangers under the oaks of Mamre, hospitality leading to promise and change.

In that moment, Jacob understood: the Kingdom was not a place of certainty or ease, but a calling into the wild unknown. And like Abraham, he was being asked to open his door—not to what was comfortable or familiar, but to what might unsettle and transform.

He took a deep breath and moved closer to the fire, letting the warmth wash over him as the rain whispered around them.",2,1748947416.0,Christianity,1,1.0,False

I'm 48 yo, 5 feet, 74kgs, and have been trying to lose body fat/weight for the last 8 years. I've been hovering between 70-75kgs since what feels like forever though. Every time I manage to get lower than 72kgs, I will literally gain 1-2kgs by the next day.

Here is what I'm doing (under the advice of a dietician):

1. 20 inclined push ups per day, 5x week

2. 20 reps per arm of ""bow draws"" using a resistance band per day, 5x week

3. 20 reps per arm of bicep curls using a resistance band per day, 5x week

4. Either walking a minimum of an hour per day, up to 5x week OR doing a minimum of 1 hour in Beat Saber per day, up to 5x week. (these are done interchangeably. i.e. if I can't do one, I do the other)

5. Going to the gym 1x week where I do 40 mins walking on the treadmill, 15 mins on rowing mach, 40 mins on recumbent bicycle (I can only go 1x week due to work schedule right now, though am planning on upping this to 2x week once I move house later this year)

6. Eating no more than 1100 calories per day, with the exception of one day per week where I eat up to 1500 calories. Most days I actually eat less than 1100 cals.

7. Fasting between 7pm - 10am every day. 10 am = 700 ml of coffee with oat milk (\~100 cals). Lunch is typically \~300 cals at 1-2pm, and my evening meal is typically 300-600 cals at 6:30pm with desert being \~50-100 cals. 

My dietician and I are both scratching our heads, because with all the exercise I do, combined with my restricted calories and fasting habits, the weight (mathematically) should be literally falling off, but it's not.

I (with the advice from my dietician) have, over the last 4 years, tried increasing my calories to 1500 per day, increasing how much I exercise by an extra hour each day, decreasing how much I exercise, decreasing my calories to 600 per day, and doing more weight lifting to build muscle. Each time we've changed things, my weight will go down to 70-72kgs (from 74) after about a week, but within another week, all the weight goes back on and my fat percentage (measured by pinching) stays the same.

I can't do any running/jogging due to my heart rate increasing to dangerous levels when I do, so that's out. Also, my GP has run numerous blood tests to check for any underlying health conditions which might be causing this and everything has come out fine. According to my GP, I am very healthy and in good shape for someone my age. I'm just 10kgs overweight.

So here are my questions and plea for advice - Have any of you here had this problem? How did you solve it? What can I do to get rid of this fat and extra weight? It's seriously affecting my mental health and self confidence and I am truly at a loss. Thank you all for any help you may be able to give.",4,1748947215.0,FTMFitness,17,1.0,False

I had dinner with one of them yesterday. She mentioned she had coffee my ex recently, and told me about what he has been up to.

I reposted a male friend's instagram story of us having a drink together a few weeks ago. Mutual friend said my ex asked if she knew who this guy was and if I was dating him. The funny thing is, my ex actually knew who this male friend was and they have met before, but he probably forgot about him. While I am not officially dating this friend, he has been actively pursuing me since my breakup.

This set me back in my healing process, I had so much anxiety after hearing about this. While my ex shattered my heart and I sank into deep depression because of him leaving me, I don't want him to think I'm able to move on quickly to another guy, or that I'm playing games to make him jealous. My friends all told me I'm single and can do whatever I want now, but I somehow feel an immense amount of guilt towards my ex.

most of these apps are running decent models but they're crippling them with tiny context windows. character ai? 3200 characters. crushon? 8k tokens. that's like giving einstein amnesia every 5 minutes

tested this by running the same storyline across different platforms:

* character ai forgot the main plot after \~30 messages
* talkie forgot character names after \~25
* crushon lasted maybe 45 before total memory wipe
* janitor ai depends on your api but usually caps around 4k

then tried rubii ai - 200k context. that's not a typo. kept a complex storyline going for 200+ messages and it still remembered the coffee shop we mentioned in message 3

here's the kicker - they let you pick your model. claude opus 4, gpt-4, gemini flash (unlimited btw). it's like having access to the actual AI instead of some watered down version

plus they actually let the AI use its full capabilities. markdown, html formatting, no content filters. watching an AI actually create formatted documents in-character instead of just plain text? chef's kiss

oh and image gen that doesn't produce eldritch horrors. revolutionary, i know

anyway if you're wondering why your AI chats feel repetitive and dumb, check your app's context window. might not be the AI's fault

what memory limits are you guys dealing with? curious if anyone found other high-context options",5,1748947143.0,CharacterAIrunaways,2,0.86,False

1l28kic,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1l28kic/feeling_overwhelmed_by_how_fast_this_guy_is_moving/,Feeling overwhelmed by how fast this guy is moving,"so i met this guy through work about 3 months ago. we’ve only talked and seen each other 3-4 times during work meetings very briefly. it’s professional stuff, but sometimes we’d just chat casually about what we did on the weekend and whatever. 

then out of nowhere, about a week ago, he found me on instagram and asked if i wanted to grab coffee next saturday (this week now). i said yes because i was kinda interested, but then he started messaging me non-stop all day. honestly i’m not used to that kind of attention. it’s kinda overwhelming. he responds fast and i just reply when i can. 

he’s very sweet and thoughtful. in the first couple of days, he’d text me goodnight and then an hour later say good morning ?? which i thought was weird, so i asked. he said it’s because he was half asleep and assumed i texted him back, so i told him to stop doing that and he listened. 😭

last weekend he told me he went to the beach and even brought me back a shell which he wants to give to me on saturday. yesterday he asked if ive eaten and offered to get me something. during one of our convos he randomly asked if i can cook, to which i responded, “i can make good pasta” and he was like “maybe you could make it for me one day,” which was kinda cute but also felt like a lot. like he’s already sure i’ll be with him. 

he sends me a lot of reels and one was of someone making brownies, i told him i like them, so he baked them at home and said he’ll give some to me when we meet on saturday. It’s honestly sweet but feels like things are moving really fast. 

the thing is, i’m not even sure if i’m being irrational here or if this kind of attention is normal early on in dating. it just feels like a lot, especially since im used to a different pace. sometimes i worry he might be love bombing me (since we’ve only been texting like this for a week), but other times i think maybe i’m just not used to this kind of affection.

has anyone else experienced something similar? how do you tell if someone is genuinely interested or moving too fast? i’d really appreciate some honest advice or just some perspective. ",1,1748947085.0,dating_advice,4,0.67,False

1l28gqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1l28gqo/dont_worry_about_it_it_would_pass/,"Don't worry about it , it would pass","Hello guys, It's been almost a year and a half we're I've almost died due to lack of knowledge about crohn disease. When I say almost I mean losing 30 - 35 kilos in about 3 months cause I couldn't eat , drink or do anything. All that happened in one of my most difficult times of my life. Losing one of my favourite family members, breaking up with my girlfriend, my job was falling apart , client said they needed something better and shipped faster and also on top of all that my teachers weren't the nicest too. Before of all that I was actually a cool kid going on holiday , having a solid bussiness, had a solid relationship and actually quite a big friend group. Then in my 20's this struck and I was stuck in the hospital every week doing blood tests and a billion test at the same time and sleeping on the most uncomfortable beds possible next to a 3 time 80 year old stroke survival on Christmas which is my birthday. Totally crazy and I've never thought of it. None of my friends came to visit me none of my clients understand it neither does my teachers even understand it. The only hope was seeing my mom that said that was everything ok and also the women of the 80 year old next to me that kept me company all those nights and also made me laugh (big props to that women, I hope that his husband would be ok and their life would get better). Well after 1,5 weeks in the hospital they found out my disease and I was devastated to say the least but I was happy at the same time cause I could actually live again. Couple of days later I am free from the hospital with a super strict diet and pills that I need to take for about 6 months and pills for about 5 years and 55 kilos from 88 I was couple months back. I thought ""shoot that really happened"" . I've took 2 weeks to even talk to someone I was just drinking coffee and smoking at home didn't want to do nothing cause I said it was all over cause again everything hurt even walking was almost impossible cause my legs hurted. Then just one day one friend called me and told to go out for a coffee ( I haven't seen him for about a year) and we've chatted for a bit and then told ""dude ,everything is ok you would figure it out"". In that part I need to elaborate that I was a cs major and I had a good idea in web development. Anyway, in that day I couldn't sleep and told myself ""f*ck it I need to do something"" messaged all my town using the cold email method went to all the network events in my city and chatted to literally E V E R Y O N E. Fast forward to today , I am 88 kg, I've made good money. I've helped people in my class understand certain topics cause I liked talking about web development and also find a non toxic relationship and with that friend I've told you guys earlier we've made a bussiness that actually shocked some investors and big names in that field to help. I am happier than ever chillest than ever and also healthy. Why I am talking about my experience. I don't want you to sell you a course or anything I just wanted to tell that you must fight for it. Having this disease is I hard I've had my times running to the bathroom and being there for hours and also that I could go out cause the pain was killing me but at the end of the day I didn't gave up. That what you have to do too. Hope everyone's life gets better and hope you all the best and also never give up no matter how klisse it sounds


Edit: I also want to give some tips for this that helped me

1. NOTHING IS THE END OF THE WORLD.
Literally you can stress all the time fight with yourself and stuff like that, it not an option. Just do what you have to do an you would get better


2. Enjoy your life with it.
Don't let it ruin your life , have fun with friends grab a coffee ( some times if you see that your flare is getting worse with it) or grab a tea

3. Go for hike
Enjoy nature see nice places and just live the moment 

4. Take a break in Sundays.
As person who worked like a worked like a dog 7/7 from my 18 years of age till the past year I can say it isn't worth it dude. You have so much time in your hands just live your life. You can have so much money and be a 70 year old with no children and just money that you can't spend on stuff to make you happy

5. Don't do stupid sh*t .
I was the person who do that just to see people laugh cause I liked people laughing and having a good time but I was actually a clown. Don't be the clown just make people laugh with jokes

6. Communicate .
If you are in a time where your flare ups are super bad call someone you can trust and talk to them you would forget it and continue

7. Do what you want.
Seriously , the title says all. You want to book a vacation to ibiza with your boyfriend or girlfriend? If you have the money do it. Don't fear it cause you don't know what would happen it the middle of it

8. Don't take sh*t from no one. 
Your most valuable thing other than time is your mental state. If some jerk made you feel down cut them off. I've spoke to 100s of people and only 10 of them are good people who I can talk to them without filters

9. Don't drink .
It's obvious but I have to say it. I wasn't drinking at all actually . Maybe once every 3 months I would have a drink or two of vodka but the problem now is that it makes my flare up worse and I couldn't stand it so I cut it off completely 

10. Exercise, exercise, exercise 
You would look better and also have a better state of mind cause if you made your body to look good you would feel better. Also your health would actually get better too so it's a win win

1l28ggv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1l28ggv/1_year_and_3_months_later_and_still_comparing_and/,1 year and 3 months later and still comparing and grieving,"I've never done a reddit post but here goes.

I (26F but 25F at time of the break up) broke up with my boyfriend of 3 1/2 years (29M but now 30M). It's been a year and 3 months of the breakup (feb 2024) and I can't seem to get over it and stop comparing my life. 

The reason was due to my mental health after both my grandads and dad passed away in the year 2023 months apart. I wasn't okay and felt it was best as I wasn't sure how I felt after everything had happened. I did want some indepence as well as I felt he was babying me and did discuss this at the time and he was there and very supportive through it all but was a bit much after everything.

After a few months I felt more like myself and we were speaking during the breakup only for him to text me over the phone he didn't love me anymore after 6 months and that he slept with someone else. After this, we had been in and off since then with him saying he compared a lot to this other girl he had slept with and was eventually seeing and they only lasted 7 weeks from August of last year. After then it was on and off with me trying to date as well as focus on myself with him saying he wasn't okay with me dating but he still didn't know how he felt about getting back together with me. I decided to wait and there was a lot of breadcrumbing from him and for us to possibly try again in the future with a coffee and a catch up when he moves out so he isn't getting judgement around him.

He's not on social media so I have no idea what he's doing or up to but he blocked me recently after the back and forth of us both saying we could be friends. In his last text he said that it had been a year and for me to move on and to stop reaching out and to leave him alone.

I think he might of moved on with someone else which is also fair but would rather him tell me that instead of blocking me on everything and for him to be honest and I have always been with him. There is a lot more to the whole year but the blocking was recent and it's made me have panic attacks about my own love life and life in general. 

My overall question is did anyone find anyone better or get over the comparisons? 

He's very successful, more than likely with someone else (im not 100% but it wouldnt be hard as he is very handsome) and has lots of friends. I work in the NHS, not that great looking but have improved a lot from 2024 with going to gym and cutting back on alcohol but have 0 friends. Can anyone give me advice on how to stop comparing or if it would get any better in the future with dating as he was the best partner I ever had (I've only dated 2 men in my life)",1,1748946674.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

We both started in the relationship as both broke with me just finished college and him already working but only earning about 7k/month. Nung bago palang kami, he used to take me on dates budget would be around 200 pesos plus lodging fees if ever we plan on going there. 

He’s worked for around 2 yrs during our relationship to save money for his trainings. 

The rest of the 3 yrs during the relationship, wala na siya work cause he’s focusing on his trainings and application para makasakay ng barko. And ako naman ang may work at malaki naman ang sahod ko, so ako naman ang bumabawi sa kanya cause he’s been there for me when I had nothing.

Now, during those times I’ve been supporting him. Heavy support since 2022 til now kasi dito na siya sa bahay nakatira and everytime pupunta siya ng Manila for his trainings or mag a-apply, sagot ko yung bayad sa boarding house, yung food niya minsan, any emergency na need niya ng money, sagot ko. I even bought him two phones na which cost me around 60k in total.

All of our dates since nawalan siya ng work, ako ang sagot. Pag mag checheck in kami ako ang magbabayad, basically everything ng need niya since nawalan siya ng work, ako ang magsheshell out. And I’m not stingy when it comes to him. It even gives me joy pag nabibilhan ko siya ng mga needs niya even those things na wants na, masaya ako pag nabibigay ko sa kanya.

Pag nagkakapera siya during those times, he doesn’t spend it on me. Automatic para sa trainings niya or para sa bahay nila, which I did not mind then dahil reasonable naman kung san niya gagastusin.

Wala akong problema sa boyfriend ko in terms ng pagtrato niya sakin, he cares for me a lot, he updates, he doesn’t follow girls in IG or watch porn. 

Pero kasi—now na may work na siya, he hasn’t spent any money on me not even for 100 pesos. May part ako sa alote niya, sinabi naman niya pwede ko daw gastusin. Pero ayoko gastusin ng basta basta dahil pera niya yun. Iba parin yung magsasabi siya ng specific amount like “kuha ka ng 150 for your coffee” or “may lakad ka? Kuhaan mo 200 pang coffee ah”

Why am I mentioning any amounts? Kasi mas nakuha pa niya bigyan yung brother ko ng 2k bayad niya daw sa ilang beses pag hatid sundo sa kanya sa airport.

I see him spending money on himself, buying all these things for himself (which I’m happy for him). 

Nagagalaw ko lang money niya pag may pinapasend siya money para sa family niya and pag need niya ng load for AIS.

His birthday is coming and I’m planning on buying a cake for him even if he’s not here, but now…now bigla ko lang na realize and felt na I’m being taken for granted…why…am I thinking of buying something for him when he hasn’t even done that for me in a long while? I’m starting to slowly resent him.

I’m doing a bit of research and would love to hear from this awesome community about your snacking preferences—especially when it comes to things that are tasty, guilt-free, and a little different from the usual chips or chocolate.

We’re exploring an idea for a new kind of snack:
👉 A thick, flavored yoghurt (like Skyr) that’s:

- Rich and creamy

- Naturally sweetened with real fruit (no added sugar) — could even work for toddlers!

- Packs 20 grams of protein per cup

- Costs around Rs. 60–80

- Bonus: Also acts as a probiotic

The idea is to offer a snack that tastes like a treat, but secretly gives you some real nutrition. Easy to grab between meals or have as a light dessert. Flavors we’re exploring: mango, coffee, vanilla, and strawberry.

Feel free to be totally honest—even if it’s a “nah, I’ll stick to my samosas.” 😄
Just trying to understand how people snack today, and what might actually fit into that.

As much as we love our snacks, I feel like many of us are slowly shifting towards better choices.
So, I'm curious. What do you look for, while actively picking a new snack?

However, I only drink one cup a day and I am strict in consuming caffeine in the morning only. Today I tried to think of what I've been doing differently these last couple of days and I realized I've started drinking this herbal tea a couple of days ago. It's from the swedish brand Friggs and it's called ""kvällsro"" which basically translates to ""evening calm"". It's said to be naturally caffeine free and to be beneficial for sleep. Last night I didn't even have it particularly late, but around five or six in the afternoon.

The ingredients:  
**30% Passionflower** (Passiflora tarapotina I believe, based on the photo on the packaging)  
**25% Lavender**  
**25% Lemon balm**  
**20% Peppermint**

Is there any of these herbs that could have a disruptive effect on my sleep? I have a couple of intolerances and I am pretty sensitive to food in general. For what it's worth I also take Tyrosine, vitamin D and Magnesium supplements daily. Perhaps it could be worth trying it in the morning instead?",1,1748946280.0,herbalism,2,1.0,False
