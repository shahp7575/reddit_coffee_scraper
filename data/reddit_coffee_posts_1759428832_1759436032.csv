If you study her demeanor in the bar scene in ep1 and the coffee meetup in ep3 closely, you can tell that she's not fully over conrad. She's pushed it down and tried to move on because conrad's heart is clearly with someone else, but I could sense something still lingering within her.
She literally said to conrad ""Do you mean I have no idea what it's like to be in unrequited love with someone who's never gonna feel the same way back?"" referring to conrad, and he later thanks her for sticking it out and working through it to be his friend.
At this point she's doing what people in love do when they know they'll never have a chance- wishing for and ensuring that the person they love finds their happiness, just like conrad did with belly and jere, and taylor with steven and denise.",12,1759434049.0,tsitp,6,1.0,False

If you're still using Excel to track your TBR in 2025, I need you to know you're making your life way harder than it needs to be because that's like using a typewriter to write emails - technically it works but why are you torturing yourself like that? I spent two years building the ""perfect"" spreadsheet with color-coded cells, dropdown menus, and formulas that would calculate my reading pace, and you know what happened? I never opened it because the thought of updating that monstrosity after finishing a book felt like homework, plus trying to access it on my phone was an absolute nightmare of zooming in and out like I was trying to decode ancient hieroglyphics.

Then there's the phone notes app method that every casual reader swears by, and look, I get the appeal - it's right there, it syncs across devices, super quick to add titles when your friend recommends something at coffee. But let's be real, after you hit 50 books on that list, it becomes this endless scroll of chaos where you can't remember if you added that book twice, you have zero way to filter by genre or mood, there's no tracking system to know what you've actually started versus what's been sitting there for three years, and God forbid you want to add notes about why you wanted to read something because now your list looks like a ransom note. The phone notes app is basically just a slightly more organized version of screaming book titles into the void and hoping you remember them later.

But here's where I'm gonna get controversial and probably piss off the Excel stans - a proper [Book Tracker Notion template](https://www.notion.so/marketplace/templates/book-tracker-log-journal-llllllllll) is objectively the best solution and there's literally no competition. Before you roll your eyes and assume I'm just another Notion fanboy, hear me out because I fought this conclusion for months before finally giving in. A good Notion book tracker lets you do everything: you can sort by genre, rating, publication year, or reading status with a single click, you can create different views for different moods (like a gallery view for picking your next read based on covers, or a table view when you want to see all your data), you can add detailed notes, quotes, and even link to reviews without cluttering anything, and the mobile app actually works smoothly unlike Excel which feels like trying to perform surgery with oven mitts.

The game-changer for me was having a ""currently reading"" section separate from my TBR, plus a ""wishlist"" section for books I'm interested in but not committed to buying yet, and having all of this accessible from my phone while I'm at the bookstore trying to remember if I already own that edition of Pride and Prejudice (spoiler: I owned three copies). You can track reading challenges, see statistics about your reading habits without building complex formulas, and customize literally everything to match how your brain works instead of forcing yourself into Excel's rigid structure. The best part? When you finish a book, you just drag it to your ""completed"" section, add your rating and thoughts, and boom - it's archived beautifully with all your other finished reads, not buried in some spreadsheet tab you named ""2024 Complete"" that you'll never look at again.

Sure, there's a tiny learning curve if you've never used Notion before, maybe 10 minutes of clicking around to understand how databases work, but once you set it up (or grab a template that someone already designed), you'll wonder how you ever survived with those barbaric methods. The satisfaction of having a beautiful, functional, actually-usable TBR system that makes you excited to track your reading instead of dreading it is genuinely life-changing, and I'm not being dramatic - my reading increased by 40% last year just because I finally had a system I actually wanted to use instead of one that felt like punishment.",0,1759433456.0,BookshelvesDetective,0,0.33,False

1nwdgom,https://www.reddit.com/r/Suburbanhell/comments/1nwdgom/suburbia_is_massively_underrepresented_in_tv_and/,Suburbia is massively underrepresented in TV and movies because it's lame,"So yesterday, I was sitting in a Mexican restaurant and, surprisingly, instead of a telenovela or Univision or Telemundo, they were playing the Hallmark Channel.

So I sat there lip-reading, trying to figure out what was going on in this show. There was a a pediatrician guy and a baker lady, very Hallmark-y.

But I noticed something interesting. I‚Äôve seen it before in these types of movies, even though I don‚Äôt watch a ton of them: suburbia is basically hidden, brushed under the rug.

Because in real life, you‚Äôre just not going to meet people spontaneously in suburbia, right?

In this movie (filmed somewhere in the northeast, it looked like), they‚Äôre constantly running into each other. They‚Äôre randomly bump into each other walking on the beach (not tropical, more like Canadian, with jackets and all). And the most unbelievable part: the pediatrician guy walks off his back porch with his dog, squats down to pat him, looks up, and bam; the female lead is walking her dog on the sidewalk right there.

How many times has this happened in suburbia? I feel like the answer is basically never.

Cars do show up, but only as props. At one point, there‚Äôs a legal mix-up, so you get the dramatic ‚Äúgetting into a car‚Äù moment, leaning over to talk through the window, etc. But otherwise, hardly any cars at all.

To make these movies interesting, you have to cut out all the boring, mind-numbing, horrible things about suburbia. You need chance encounters (third places, coffee shops, sidewalks, beaches) places where people constantly run into each other.

And when I thought about it, I realized this happens in a lot of media. Movies, books, TV, they either show:

* Massive walkable cities (what percentage of movies take place in NYC?), or
* Imaginary tiny towns where everyone somehow lives within walking distance (instead of ‚Äúin the area‚Äù or ‚Äúright outside of town‚Äù).

In real life, tiny downtowns exist, but barely anyone actually lives in them. Real-life example near me: Greer, SC. Technically a population of around 60,000 people, but maybe 200 live in downtown. The rest? Sprawl, cul-de-sacs, and strip malls. So Hallmark movies (and similar media) pretend it‚Äôs 100 years ago, when everyone lived within walking distance of a little town.

The truth is:

* Suburbia is not romantic.
* Suburbia is not interesting.
* Suburbia is not fun.
* Suburbia is not spontaneous.

So suburbia is massively underrepresented in our media. We either go big (massive cities where you meet-cute at the train station) or we go home (unrealistic small towns that no longer really exist in most places).",31,1759433451.0,Suburbanhell,17,0.79,False

I buy fresh beans, have a good set up that I've invested a lot of time in. Its a hobby.

I've had difficulty sleeping on and off over a perirod of time and tbh most of it is stress or anxiety related.

In dealing with one these periods where I wasn't sleeping I read that drinking caffeine when tired and stressed makes matters worse. So I stopped. then when i finally got back to sleeping good for 3 nights i continued decaf. Ive not been as stressed so that has helped a lot and I've improved my sleep routine.

I was drinking around 36g of coffee a day which is around 430mg of caffeine. It isnt that much compared to some.

Im worried about ruining my good sleep streak but really enjoy the coffee scene and making my coffee in the morning but value sleep more obviously. 

Im thinking of perhaps reducing my usage eto 100mg per day in the morning only and seeing how that goes. still worries me though given what people say on here. I'd have it no later than 10am and not at all if im over tired or stressed.

Ive definitely had periods of absolutely fine sleep with my normal drinking habits so I wonder if its not the caffeine and more the stress and routine element? I can drink more on the weekend without having to get up early and I've not had trouble sleeping. Surely if it was the coffee then it would always be troublesome? 

Just wondering if anyone has any thoughts from experience. I also dont mean to undermine anyone's opinion or experience about cutting it out completely - if it helps my sleep massively in the long run then ill do it. I guess im just trying to see if I can salvage a hobby!",1,1759433447.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

Some things about me, I work for one of the largest investment companies in the US, I've been in the financial field for about 4 and a half years now. Before that, I spent about the same amount of time working in water damage restoration. I am college educated, I actually went back to college for a finance degree, switched to marketing because it was interesting, stayed and plan to stay in finance. Minor mistake. I'm very big on honesty and not hiding any secrets, ask about anything and everything.

Physically, I am 6 feet tall, I go to the gym but I also like to eat, I'm white, brown hair, brown eyes. Just a pretty generic dude. I wear size 12 shoes but size 13 boots, the boots also make me 6'2 in case I plan on reaching the top-top shelf that day. I have 3 tattoos and plan on getting more. 

Hobbies are kinda scattered here and there. My main two are watching formula 1 every weekend it's on, and playing games primarily on PS5 or PC. I commit to reading a few books a year, I enjoy poetry, every now and then I'll build a Lego, I'm slightly involved in the furry community since I have a good friend who is an artist, I like doing things with my hands, I enjoy making coffee, I like going out to stores and to eat, I have a cat, I keep myself busy most days and out of the house. 

What I'm looking for is something genuine and long term. Yap on reddit for a bit to see if there's a connection, move onto somewhere else. I want yap sessions, if we have similar hobbies then lets do them together, be shoulders to lean on, add to each other's lives, become a positive stone on your path. Be a name that when I think of it or see it, I think of you and smile.

* **Buff Knight:** ‚ÄúAll right. Tell us about Bloomington‚Äôs criminal underworld.‚Äù

1nwd4oj,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nwd4oj/what_are_the_best_places_to_shop_for_portable_mug/,What are the best places to shop for portable mug warmer?,"Hey everyone! I've been on a mission lately to find the perfect mug warmer, and I thought I'd share my experience with you all. As someone who constantly forgets about their coffee until it's ice cold, I've become quite the expert on keeping drinks warm throughout the day.

After countless hours of research and trying different options, I've discovered that Amazon is actually one of the best places to shop for mug warmers. The variety is incredible, and the reviews from real users have been super helpful in making my decision.

I recently found this awesome mug warmer that's been a game-changer for me: https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer. It's got temperature control features and automatically shuts off when your mug is removed ‚Äì pretty neat, right?

But let's talk about other places I've looked. Target has some decent options, but their selection is limited compared to online retailers. Walmart carries a few basic models, but they're usually the same ones you can find on Amazon for better prices.

What really matters when choosing a mug warmer is:
- Temperature control options
- Auto shut-off features
- Size compatibility with your favorite mugs
- Power source (USB vs. traditional plug)
- Durability of the heating plate

One thing I've learned is that those cheap $10 warmers usually don't last long. It's worth investing in a quality model that'll keep your beverages at the perfect temperature without burning them.

If you're still unsure, I'd recommend checking out this specific model I mentioned earlier (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer). It checks all the boxes and has been super reliable for both my coffee and tea.

Some pro tips from my experience:
- Look for models with temperature displays
- Make sure it's compatible with your mug material
- Consider getting one with a timer function
- Read recent reviews from verified purchasers
- Check the warranty terms

Remember, while specialty kitchen stores carry mug warmers, they're usually overpriced compared to online options. Plus, shopping online gives you access to detailed product descriptions and honest customer reviews.

I've found that having a reliable mug warmer has actually helped me reduce waste (no more dumping cold coffee!) and save money (fewer trips to the coffee shop for fresh, hot drinks).

1nwd1dx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nwd1dx/explore_the_best_countertop_blender_vitamix_e310/,Explore the Best Countertop Blender Vitamix E310 Worth the Hype,"I‚Äôve had the opportunity to use the Vitamix VM0197 almost daily for a couple of months now, and I can confidently say it‚Äôs a fantastic piece of kitchen equipment. As someone who loves experimenting with everything from smoothies to soups, this blender has naturally found its place on my countertop. Vitamix has always had a reputation for producing professional-grade products, and their attention to detail with this model is evident in every use. While it‚Äôs not without its quirks, there‚Äôs no denying its performance and build quality.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of the Vitamix VM0197 is elegant yet practical. Its robust black finish feels timeless and fits well into any kitchen d√©cor without feeling overly industrial. Measuring 11 inches in depth, 8 inches in width, and standing 18 inches tall, the blender doesn‚Äôt overshadow my counter space but does require a taller shelf for storage. I appreciated the thoughtful inclusion of BPA-free materials, and the stainless-steel blades truly scream durability. Even after rigorous use with tough ingredients like frozen fruit and nuts, the blades didn‚Äôt lose their sharpness or effectiveness. The addition of a radial cooling fan and a thermal protection system ensures the motor stays protected during long blending sessions‚Äîa feature I noticed hard at work when making hot soups.  

**Performance and Versatility**  
What genuinely stands out in this blender is its performance. With a 2 HP motor and 10 variable speed settings, I‚Äôve been able to refine textures effortlessly. Whether it's creamy purees, hearty soups, or chunkier blends like salsa, there‚Äôs unparalleled control available with its wide speed range. The pulse feature is particularly handy for recipes that require layering textures like chunky vegetable soup. One evening, I even experimented with grinding coffee beans, which this machine tackled without hesitation. It‚Äôs a pleasure to have a single appliance capable of blending, emulsifying, chopping, and grinding.  

[Check Vitamix VM0197 price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0758jhzm3/)  

**Ease of Cleaning**  
Cleaning this blender has been surprisingly simple. For a busy household like mine, where appliances often stay dirty longer than they should, the self-cleaning feature feels like a blessing. A drop of dish soap and warm water, followed by running it on the highest speed, leaves the container sparkling clean in under a minute. There‚Äôs no disassembling involved, which significantly reduces post-prep cleanup hassle. And though it‚Äôs labeled dishwasher-safe, I‚Äôve found the self-cleaning option adequately thorough for everyday use.  

**Pluses**  
- Impressive motor power that blends through tough ingredients.
- Self-cleaning functionality for quick maintenance.  
- Variable speed control and pulse features for precision blending.  
- Durable, stainless-steel blades ideal for both soft and dense ingredients.  

**Critiques**  
- The 48-ounce container works well for small to medium batches but might feel limiting for larger families.  
- It‚Äôs slightly noisy, especially when tackling dense or frozen ingredients.  
- Taller design may not easily fit under lower kitchen cabinets.  

**Other Options**  
When comparing this blender to competing brands like the Blendtec Total Classic and Ninja Foodi Power Blender, there are clear standout factors. Both the Blendtec and Ninja offer comparable power at a possibly lower price point, but neither seems to match the consistent blending quality of the VM0197. The Ninja Foodi, for example, struggled to match the smooth texture I achieved with hummus in the Vitamix. On the other hand, Blendtec offers a more compact design, which might appeal to users with smaller kitchens. But where both competitors fall short is in self-cleaning, an area where the Vitamix shines. For me, this model‚Äôs durability and reliability feel worth the extra money.  

**Quality for Price**  
Vitamix products aren‚Äôt cheap; there‚Äôs no denying that. This blender falls into the premium category, and at first, I wrestled with the price. But after weeks of owning it, I now believe it‚Äôs a proper investment, especially when considering the lasting build quality. Vitamix even backs their products with a substantial five-year warranty covering parts and labor, so I felt reassured about the durability. For anyone seeking a long-term appliance that doesn‚Äôt skimp on features or performance, this blender feels warranted for the cost.

I‚Äôm too old and it‚Äôs too late for me to have a chance anyone.,"I‚Äôm in my mid 40s and my not wanting to live is because I  don‚Äôt have any close friends or family and I tried the dating apps looking for a long term partner that I desperately need to feel purpose. Well here I am, my last partner had broken up with me for the 4th time because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not right for her‚Äù only this time it‚Äôs different, she‚Äôs fallen for a coworker she got EXTREMELY close to over the last 6 months. She and I were together for the last 5 years on and off. She has now cheated on me twice. Why did I go back so many times? Because I was on EVERY dating app until I ran out of people to swipe or date and left with nothing because of the rare type of person I am, this happened each time before I got back with her, and even getting her back was an extreme challenge.

Before meeting her, each time I was on the apps for long (2-3 year) runs tryout to find a good partner who is a match that will actually work. I paid for premium exposure to help the process but the statistics are insane if you look into it on who actually is successful on there. Spent thousands of dollars for ‚Äúspotlight‚Äù type features and taking people out of coffee and dinners just for a dead end. Did that for 3 years as mentioned then met someone I dated for like 2 years who was really messed up but the only one I could find a real connection with enough similarities to to date long term. Then 3 years of constant costly looking until I found the one I mentioned. And how I‚Äôve basically become broken beyond repair, and aged out of finding anyone who‚Äôs not a complete mess. So it‚Äôs over. It‚Äôs end game and I lost big time. No one wants me and it‚Äôs the same pain but this time more realization that the options are zero of finding someone compatible and together enough to have a successful relationship. Loneliness is ultimately the killer here. When I was younger there were many more people who were options. I truly envy you. You have so many options.

Somehow, people that i havent talked to in a while are hitting me up again. Wanting to see me/ talk to me. 

People at my new job, that LITERALLY HAVE BEEN RUDE TO ME for no reason and haven't aknowleged me, started to talk to me randomly, asking me to join them for coffee, asking about my day etc. 

People working in bars/grocery stores etc started being extra friendly to me.

Monday will make 1 year that my brother died.
And all of the guilt and regrets are coming back heavy.
So here‚Äôs what happened.
He struggled with addiction and mental health issues for more than half of his life.
Beginning with severe childhood trauma that no one knew about until years later.
He attempted suicide several times, was in and out of hospitals, psyche wards, rehabs and eventually jails. 
The last 3 years of his life it felt like he basically gave up.
And gave in.
He was homeless and on drugs/alcohol.
His mental health got worse and worse and he was starting to become violent.
He had already been diagnosed with bipolar disorder but now it seemed like he was becoming schizophrenic. 
Anyways.
Me and my mom kept trying to save him but didn‚Äôt know how. And he didn‚Äôt seem to want to saved.
But that didn‚Äôt stop us from trying.
We flew back and forth (he was in another state) and would rent a car looking for him. Once we would find him we would bring him food and try to talk to him, even though he was stinky and made 0 sense. 
We called crisis lines. 
They did nothing.
A few times we had to call the cops.
They basically did nothing too.
We would ask them to bring him to the hospital and they would release him hours later back to the streets.
He lost every phone we gave him.
He was living on an another planet and to be honest, it seemed he preferred it that way.
Me and my mom couldn‚Äôt sleep because we never knew where he was or what was happening to him.
It was traumatizing and terrifying to see him live like that.
Eventually we decided (per the cops suggestion) to press charges against him so that the courts could force him into treatment. Apparently the only way he could be forced was if he had committed a felony, which he already had committed several, we just kept letting him off the hook. 
So we tried it.
The courts offered him mental health court.
He declined of course.
There was nothing wrong with him.
He was forced into addiction treatment.
It was a really nice one that our cousin worked at. 
He had everything and if he completed it he would have all charges against him dropped.
A week before graduation he hopped the fence and left. Relapsed. 
Ended up BACK in jail for punching a nurse while in psychosis. 
Court ordered back into treatment.
But not a dual diagnosis program, just a regular drug/alcohol program.
Why? I‚Äôll never know.
I guess it was the first available and the PO didn‚Äôt give a fuck.
While he‚Äôs there he sneaks to call me.
He asks how we‚Äôre all doing.
The truth? Our step sister had just killed herself.
I didn‚Äôt want to tell him and set him off.
I tried to lie.
He saw through me.
I told him the truth.
I could tell he was upset by how he was breathing.
I told him to breath, said it was gonna be okay and asked if he had a counselor he could talk to about this?
He said yes.
I said please tell them whats going on. I love you
He said okay i love you too.
He never told anyone.
A few days later he got into it with another client and threw coffee at him.
They kicked him out.
Dropped him off at a homeless shelter in the worst part of town with all the drug addicts.
He called me one more time.
I told him to please be safe and asked where he was so we could come see him?
He said I‚Äôll let you know when yall can come.
We both said i love you.
3 nights later a detective called me.
He had overdosed and died right there on the street.
I couldn‚Äôt believe it.
I still can‚Äôt.
But i need to know.
Is it my fault?
For telling him something triggering while he was in rehab?
For not thinking to call the rehab myself and ask them to rally around him?
Or is it the rehab‚Äôs fault for kicking him out without getting him help?
Or is the hospital‚Äôs?
Or the probation officer?
Or is it everyone‚Äôs fault?
I need help. 
A year later and I still feel the same.
The guilt is what kills me the most.
It makes me want to balance out the scales of justice and hurt someone.
And if I can‚Äôt legally hurt anyone else, well I can always hurt myself.
Plus it is partially my fault anyways. Right?
Someone please say something that makes sense.
Don‚Äôt sugarcoat it.

Long story short, my ex (1) left me after she thought I sexually cheated with my only other ex (2). This ex (2) and I dated for like 8 months and it was absolutely terrible broke up in 2020. My now recent ex (1) and I dated for 3 years and it was amazing. I did see this person for coffee out of the blue which is so unfair but rather than most people would think, I had a selfish moment where I wanted to show this person how well I was doing and then leave. Nothing to do with dissatisfaction with my current partner or desire for my past one. This wasn‚Äôt premeditated it was so dumb impulsive and stupid. This person lives nowhere near me so when they called me I met with them right after, and left after 5-10 mins. She was also in a relationship herself and I truly have been indifferent to this person for the last 5 years. After this brief interaction she decided to message my current partner, tell her I cheated without any context leading her to believe I slept with her or something. While what I did was a for sure breach of trust, my intentions were opposite of lust and desire and rather selfish and ego driven. This ex wanted me back and told me that after my current partner left me. I haven‚Äôt had any contact with anyone since (4 months ago). I don‚Äôt know how to move forward or deal with this knowing everyone thinks I slept with my ex when I actually hate this person. Our relationship was deeply serious and committed so this was a huge shock to everyone. I acknowledge my decision and how that caused serious pain and a break of trust. I‚Äôve waited this long to reach out because I‚Äôm trying to demonstrate I‚Äôve eliminated impulsivity from my life and have all the respect for her healing while seriously working on myself.

Crispy on the outside, tender and slightly chewy on the inside, these low carb snickerdoodles are everything you love about a great keto cookie! The toasty coating of cinnamon & sweetener makes these keto snickerdoodle cookies simply perfect with a cup of coffee!  Cookies are my absolute favorite sweet treat.  Mostly because I like their portability, built in portion control (unless you eat all of them. . . not that I'd know from experience ?,) and the fact that you can eat multiple keto cookies of different kinds without committing to one large  a person who likes to try a bite of everything, low carb cookies are my dessert  year I put together a collection of 30 of my favorite low carb cookie recipes, and now I'm adding a few more to the blog for you to try - starting with these low carb snickerdoodles! Like all of my favorite low carb cookie recipes, these are pretty easy to make! A bonus because when I start thinking I could go for a cookie, I like to be eating said keto cookie within 30 minutes or less.  ???

To make these keto snickerdoodle cookies, all you need to do is mix up your ingredients, roll the cookies into balls and dip in the cinnamon and sweetener mixture, then flatten slightly and bake for 15 minutes.  Mission accomplished! ?Toasty, cinnamon-y, cookie perfection.  Believe it.  I tried freezing these low carb snickerdoodles to see how they would hold up and they were just as good if not better than before I'd frozen them. They keep perfectly at room temperature in a sealed container for up to four days (that's how long ours  inside texture of the cookies got a little chewier every day, while the outside stayed toasty and crisp - it was awesome! I implore you to make these keto snickerdoodle cookies ASAP, and then report back as to what you thought of them! I have a feeling that once you try them, you'll be making them over and over again like I have! 

 Ingredients :

2 cups superfine almond flour

1/2 cup salted butter, softened

pinch of kosher salt

3/4 cup erythritol granulated sweetener

1nwcme7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nwcme7,2 1/2 Day Trip To NYC,"My girlfriend and I had a 2 and a half day trip to the city and decided to take full advantage of the food the city has to offer.

We both loved the city, and the NYC food scene is easily the best we've ever experienced and had so much fun here.

We know what you're thinking, so to try and be preemptive here are a few answers to some of the questions you may be having...

Yes we are big time tourists so we went to all the places you would expect people like us to go to.

Yes it was expensive, but we were willing to spoil ourselves a bit.

Yes it was a lot of food, and yes we ate it all. It was so good how could we not.

We also decided to rank what we ate below with my rankings having an M before them and hers having an H before it.

Please feel free to share your thoughts and let us know what you agree/disagree with and share with us some other spots we should check out when we come back. Cause trust me, we have to come back.

1: Popup Bagels

M - 7.8/10 H - 8.5/10 (Everything Bagel + Scallion Schmear)

M - 7.6/10 H - 9.2/10 (Sesame Bagel + Scallion Schmear)

M - 7.6/10 H - 9.3/10 (Salt Bagel + Scallion Schmear)

Amazing for what it was. We both loved the rip and dip but I personally thought it was a little basic.

2-5: Carbone

M - 9.1/10 H - 9.4/10 (Spicy Rigatoni Vodka)

M - 8.7/10 H - 8.0/10 (Caesar alla ZZ)

M - 8.5/10 H - 9.2/10 (New York Lemon Cheesecake)

M - 7.9/10 H - 7.0/10 (Mario's Meatballs)

M - 7.8/10 H - 8.4/10 (Salami, Garlic Bread With Parmesan, Homemade Mozzarella)

M - 7.8/10 H - 3.0/10 (Rainbow Cookie)

I can see why people like the ambiance of the restaurant. It was funny because every table had the same items, but they are famous for a reason and we thought their staple dishes were outstanding. Except the meatballs, they had a strong sausage flavour and the meat was more chunky and not as grounded up as we typically prefer. It is also a very expensive place.

6: Magnolia Bakery - Central Park South

M - 9.1/10 H - 9.5/10 (Pumpkin Spice Pudding)

M - 8.8/10 H - 9.4/10 (Classic Banana Pudding)

We thought both flavours were incredible and deleted them so fast. Super airy and creamy yet packed such a deep level of flavour. We also both love pumpkin spiced flavoured things and this definitely did the flavour justice.

7-10: Tatiana by Kwame Onwuachi

M - 9.4/10 H - 8.9/10 (Braised Oxtails)

M - 9.2/10 H - 9.3/10 (Curried Goat Patties)

M - 9.2/10 H - 9.1/10 (Bodega Special)

M - 8.2/10 H - 8.2/10 (Rice & Peas)

M - 6.3/10 H - 7.2/10 (Strawberry Daiquiri Boozy Jelly)

When you start throwing around some of the accolades they have like best restaurant in the city in 2024 by the NYT you build some pretty big expectations. And it feels crazy to say this but Tatiana not only delivered, they exceeded them. Everything was so unique and flavourful, which made every bite so delicious. The sauce in the braised oxtail was incredible.

11-12: Golden Diner

M - 9.6/10 H - 9.8/10 (Honey Butter Pancakes Add Berry Compote)

M - 8.0/10 H - 7.3/10 (Korean Fried Chicken Wings Saucy)

The pancakes were incredible and I can see why there was a massive lineup for them. If you haven't had them please do yourself a favour and have them. The wings were also good, they were super crunchy, huge and had good flavour. I thought the chicken quality was a bit inconsistent and it was too oily, and my girlfriend thought they were too spicy, which I don't really agree with I think it was more of a kick from the gochujang, but her spice tolerance is not the greatest.

13: L'industrie Pizzeria West Village

M - 9.1/10 H - 9.7/10 (Burrata Slice)

M - 9.1/10 H - 9.7/10 (Fig Jam & Bacon Slice)

Some of the best pizza we have both ever had if not the best. Both slices were incredible in their own way and the level of detail that goes into every component of the pizza is ridiculous. Just outstanding.

14: Caffe Panna

M - 9.6/10 H - 9.8/10 (Pretzels, Peanuts & Coffee Scoop With Panna and Oreo Brittle)

M - 8.4/10 H - 8.6/10 (Matcha Yuzu Soft Serve)

You can really tell everything they use is super high quality, and paired up with their amazing flavour combinations and boom you have yourself some of the best food you can get. We loved the rich and soft texture of the scoop, and with the added toppings a bite was an explosion of flavours. The texture on the soft serve was not personally our favourite as we thought it was too firm but we liked how it was loaded up with toppings.

15-18: Theodora

M - 9.9/10 H - 10.0/10 (Sourdough)

M - 9.4/10 H - 8.8/10 (Lamb)

M - 9.1/10 H - 9.3/10 (Doughnuts)

We both agreed this was the best meal we have ever had. From the food to the service to the ambiance everything this meal offered was incredible. The sourdough was the best thing we have both ever eaten, and we do not say that lightly. The depth of flavour and how everything paired together was something we will both be dreaming about. The lamb and doughnuts were also great, we liked the variety of sauces that came with the lamb, but personally I would have liked a sweeter sauce and we also did find the lamb a little too salty. We also both thought the doughnuts could have been filled a little more with jam and the glaze you dip them in could have been thicker and had more of a punch of flavour to it. But this is just us nitpicking as the meal was extraordinary and I would easily demolish everything a million times over. We had amazing seats at the chefs counter where we were tucked away on the bend with just two seats for a very intimate yet engaging meal.

19: Radio Bakery

M - 8.7/10 H - 9.3/10 (Apple Brown Butter Croissant)

M - 8.7/10 H - 8.8/10 (Chocolate Cherry Croissant)

M - 8.4/10 H - 8.2/10 (Brown Butter Corn Cake)

M - 8.0/10 H - 8.0/10 (Smoked Salmon Focaccia w/ Cream Cheese, Dill, Pickled Onion)

Not going to lie we were slightly let down by Radio Bakery. Don't get us wrong this place is amazing and what truly sets them apart if their execution on their unique flavours that are done so well and are very tasty. We just thought we would be blown away, and that could be partially on us for having such high expectations but we both feel like we have had better elsewhere and although everything was great we don't think it's in a tier above other places as many people may believe. 

20: Sunday Morning

M - 9.7/10 H - 9.4/10 (Banana's Foster Cinnamon Roll)

M - 9.6/10 H - 9.5/10 (Strawberry Earl Grey Cinnamon Roll)

M - 9.0/10 H - 9.6/10 (Blueberry Lemon Curd Cinnamon Roll)

M - 9.0/10 H - 8.2/10 (Caramel Pecan Cinnamon Roll)

We were both blown away by Sunday Morning. Huge and fresh cinnamon rolls that are perfect for sharing, or hey have them to yourself I'm not gonna judge they were fantastic. Definitely go with the fruit flavours they were incredible, we loved the tart and sweetness that's incorporated in the cinnamon rolls with the fruit. Additionally, we liked how they stayed true to the cinnamon roll and had a good amount of cinnamon sugar in the rolls and the toppings were additions. Please give this place a go if you have not, it's phenomenal.",26,1759431544.0,FoodNYC,6,0.93,False

This ex (2) and I dated for like 8 months and it was absolutely terrible broke up in 2020. My now recent ex (1) and I dated for 3 years and it was amazing. I did see this person for coffee out of the blue which is so unfair but rather than most people would think, I had a selfish moment where I wanted to show this person how well I was doing and then leave. Nothing to do with dissatisfaction with my current partner or desire for my past one. This wasn‚Äôt premeditated it was so dumb impulsive and stupid. This person lives nowhere near me so when they called me I met with them right after, and left after 5-10 mins. She was also in a relationship herself and I truly have been indifferent to this person for the last 5 years. After this brief interaction she decided to message my current partner, tell her I cheated without any context leading her to believe I slept with her or something. While what I did was a for sure breach of trust, my intentions were opposite of lust and desire and rather selfish and ego driven. This ex wanted me back and told me that after my current partner left me. I haven‚Äôt had any contact with anyone since (4 months ago). I don‚Äôt know how to move forward or deal with this knowing everyone thinks I slept with my ex when I actually hate this person. Our relationship was deeply serious and committed so this was a huge shock to everyone. I acknowledge my decision and how that caused serious pain and a break of trust.

We are super excited except for one thing, my future MIL. She has never really liked me and has asked him multiple times in our seven year relationship if he‚Äôs ‚Äúsure he really loves me or is just settling‚Äù. I‚Äôve tried to be as kind as I can to her but this sent me over the edge. Last week, mind you at another family members birthday party, she brought us our wedding gift more than a month early. It was one I was excited for on the registry cause it was a new keurig with the ice coffee side since that is all I use since I don‚Äôt really drink coffee, plus I‚Äôve had ours since we were in college over five years ago. 

Today was my first day off since setting it up and I just got around to breaking down the box it was in. I noticed there was a weird placement of Amazon stickers on the box when we first opened it but Amazon always does stuff like that. But today I found a note thanking us for buying it REUSED and the make sure we run it for 3 cycles for sanitary reasons. 

This isn‚Äôt the first problem we had with her for the wedding. She got upset and said it was my fault she couldn‚Äôt bring a date because we told her no since the man she sees is a drunk and called my fianc√© multiple disrespectful names and we also didn‚Äôt want a random man she sees on the side when they ‚Äúsplit‚Äù at our wedding if we didn‚Äôt know them. She mostly wanted one since his father is coming with his longtime girlfriend from since they divorced. She refused to wear the color we asked her to at first cause she couldn‚Äôt find one to ‚Äúshow off her body‚Äù she liked at first. She also hasn‚Äôt offered to help with the wedding at all and my family and us have done all of it. And now this. 

I called my fianc√© at work and told him the issue and at first he didn‚Äôt see a problem but when I explained it more he got upset as well. He has always seen himself as her most disliked child and this made him feel even worse. Now we both don‚Äôt want to use the keurig and are upset cause if she couldn‚Äôt afford it she could have just got us something cheaper on the registry.

Sorry this is so long!

I feel like since I got diagnosed and started therapy, there have been a lot of shifts in my system. I mean, like at first it felt like a big family reunion, and I was meeting a lot of new parts. Then I was trying to do a lot of mapping. Then it felt like those parts were gone, or I had been wrong about them.

When I started making an effort to discover my parts, I was constantly having identity confusion. Now I generally feel like I'm just me, but that there's a ""me"" for one thing, and a me for another thing, and so on, and each of us pretty much only remember things related to what we're doing (performing, socializing, reading, doctor visits...). If someone says , ""What did you do yesterday?"" I can't really answer unless I concentrate on contacting all these parts and piecing things together, which takes some time.

I have what I guess is a liminal space where I interact with an imaginary world, and I feel like other parts and I aren't exactly forthcoming as to who we are, but we communicate feelings through stories. I don't think any parts I communicate with this way ever front, but I think more than one of the parts who all feel like ""me"" are engaging and sharing the same two identities (I think of them as avatars. They have names/personalities/purposes, but several ""mes"" swap and share these two roles in order to communicate with the others). 

It's hard for me to understand how this is different from what I originally thought - That I'm just a regular person with a vivid imagination. But I'm supposed to keep contacting the other parts, and sometimes my therapist asks me who they are, and what kinds of things they communicate. It ranges from knowing they don't trust me/us yet, to them indicating we should be making tea or coffee for them more often (which, of course, I do... but damn y'all, we need decaf). 

If I tried mapping my system now, it would be completely different from what I thought just a couple of weeks ago. And that was already very different from what I thought just a couple of weeks before. I just don't understand how that's possible. 

I guess I shared the current state of my system, because I'm still in denial. And because if this wasn't what we looked like two weeks ago, who's to say it won't change again? And then, is that even how it works?",1,1759431356.0,OSDD,0,0.99,False

I'm a guy in my 30's. I've been dating my girlfriend for over 3 years now and things have gotten grown worse with her since we moved in together 2 years back. I'm going to list somethings she's done since we've been dating:

-Thrown stuff when having a panic attack. She hasn't done this in a few months. She's only thrown things a few times. It start off with her hitting a wall the one time. She threw my PS5 3 months ago and broke one of our TVs. She's broken a total of 3 we've had. She's been managing her anxiety since then and hasn't been physically.
-She gets really defensive when I talk about money. She has no job at the moment and I'm supporting us. She had a problem with getting coffee every day with my card. Anytime I would ask her to skip buying Dunkins for a day, her mood would shift to angry immediately. She has managed to stop and make coffee at home. 
-We have a hard time going out. She mostly talks to people on discord she's met through video games. My old friends originally welcomed her to our group, but stop talking to us when we didn't go out. She would get bad anxiety from being out in large groups and often went non-verbal. Eventually they stopped talking to us all together. Some of them did reach out to me to make sure I was okay, but that was last year. 
-Speaking of her group of friends, she still has contact with a few friends she went to school with but that's it. Last time we tried going to see one of her friends, it was only for 30 minutes. We had to drive back home because she was having anxiety and backpain (she has bad back problems) 
-She doesn't really talk to my family much and went on a rant the one time because my grandmother sometimes needs help around the house. I think I see her family more than I see mine. 

There's probably more I could list. Will things get better? I can't tell if she is an actual abuser or just crippled by her anxiety disorder. Part of me wants to stay because she has like no support other than me. She would have to move back with her parents if we broke up with no job.

1nwce5o,https://open.substack.com/pub/davidrmann3/p/millennials-customers-spend-more?r=3yrshw&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false,"Millennials Customers Spend More, Millennials Workers Quit Faster: What Restaurant Operators Must Know","**Millennials Customers Spend More, Millennials Workers Quit Faster: What Restaurant Operators Must Know**

Millennials walked into your restaurant and stayed there. They work your line. They fill your tables. They dictate the rules to you.

Born between 1981 and 1996¬π, these 72.1 million Americans¬≤ became the largest generation in the workforce¬≥. They make up 35% of all workers‚Å¥. In restaurants, they drive everything. Your revenue. Your costs. Your culture.

The numbers tell the real story.

**They Eat Out More Than Anyone Else**

Millennials spend money on food. Real money. They eat out more than any other generation‚Åµ. Their average restaurant spending hits $174 monthly‚Å∂. Compare that to older generations who cook more at home.

They dine out 71% more than they planned in 2024‚Å∑. Wednesday became their new Friday. Mid-week dining jumped 11% because of them‚Å∏. They don‚Äôt save restaurants for weekends. They use dining as therapy. As escape. As entertainment.

Solo dining rose 10% last year‚Åπ. Group parties of six or more grew 8%‚Åπ. Millennials eats alone without shame. They also gather in large groups for celebrations. Your restaurant needs both ends of this spectrum.

They take pictures of everything. Social media drives their choices. 73% try new cuisines‚Å∏. They want experiences, not just meals. Ambience matters as much as your seasoning.

Environmental values matter too. 25% seek restaurants with sustainable practices¬π‚Å∞. They pay premiums for values that match theirs. Your green practices become profit drivers.

**They Expect Different Things From Their Employer Than Previous Generations**

Millennial employees want different things. Flexibility tops every list. Work-life balance drives job decisions. They quit when expectations don‚Äôt match reality.

Restaurant employees stay 110 days on average¬π¬π. The industry turnover rate hit 79.6%¬π¬≤. Quick-service restaurants see 123% turnover¬π¬≤. You replace more people than you employ.

Replacing one employee costs $5,864 according to Cornell University‚Äôs Center for Hospitality Research¬π¬≥. This breaks into five parts: pre-departure costs ($176), recruiting ($1,173), selection ($645), training ($821), and productivity loss ($3,049)¬π¬≥. Lost productivity eats 52% of replacement costs¬π¬≥.

The math hurts. A 30-employee restaurant with 100% turnover spends $175,920 yearly on replacement costs alone. That‚Äôs before considering the work disruption, the training time, the customer service gaps.

Schedule flexibility matters most to millennial workers. 80% say they‚Äôd be more loyal to companies offering flexible schedules¬π‚Å¥. They want advance notice. They demand the ease of swapping shifts on an app on their phone. Real-time updates. The old approach of posting schedules day-of doesn‚Äôt work.

Career growth drives retention. Millennials see restaurant work as a rung on a ladder that isn‚Äôt specifically tied to restauranting. They want clear advancement paths. Structured learning. Regular feedback instead of annual reviews. They respond to participatory leadership, not command-and-control management.

Recognition became crucial. Digital shoutouts work better than employee-of-the-month plaques. Frequent check-ins beat yearly performance reviews. They want immediate acknowledgment of good work.

**Cultural Revolution**

Millennials changed restaurant culture completely. They brought technology expectations. Demanded transparency. Required sustainable practices. Made values matter.

Your restaurant‚Äôs beliefs affect hiring and customers now. Millennial workers and guests choose places that align with their values. Fair labor policies. Community involvement. Environmental responsibility. These became requirements, not nice-to-haves.

Technology integration is non-negotiable. Millennials expect mobile ordering. Digital payments. Loyalty program apps. Self-service options. Restaurants without modern tech lose both employees and customers.

Training has changed, too. Millennials want structured learning paths. They want digital learning over handouts. Interactive onboarding. They prefer collaboration over being told what to do.

The dining experience itself evolved. Trying out new dining experience bookings rose by 27%‚Åπ. Millennials want cooking classes. Tasting menus. Unique experiences they can share online.

Menu transparency became essential. They want ingredient sources. Preparation methods. Allergen information. They expect servers who know answers or know where to find them.

**The Financial Reality**

Money pressures hit Millennials hard in 2025. Restaurant traffic in younger zip codes is down by by 0.9%¬π‚Åµ. Traffic was up in these areas in 2024¬π‚Åµ.

Millennials hold under 10% of national wealth despite being 22% of the population¬π‚Å∂. 42% of adults under 30 report they‚Äôre ‚Äúbarely getting by‚Äù¬π‚Å∂. They‚Äôre broke and it affects how they are in restaurants. They still value dining out but pull back when money gets tight.

Despite pressures, Millennials prioritize dining experiences when they have money. They choose quality over quantity. They pay premiums for restaurants that deliver value beyond food.

The restaurant industry added only 13,000 jobs in the eight months of 2025¬π‚Å∑. Full-service restaurants remain 222,000 jobs below pre-pandemic levels¬π‚Å∑. Limited-service segments lead job growth. Coffee shops and snack bars grew 22% above pre-pandemic levels¬π‚Å∑.

**What This Means For You**

Stop fighting with Millennials. Start serving them. They‚Äôre not entitled. They‚Äôre informed. They know what they want. They pay for it when you deliver.

For Millennial guests, focus on the experience. Create photo-worthy food and decor. Offer customization options. Show that you are provide sustainable practices. Train staff to understand dietary preferences. Share your values.

For millennial employees, modernize management. Implement flexible scheduling systems. Create advancement pathways. Provide regular feedback. Build an inclusive workplace culture. Invest in technology that makes jobs easier.

Train managers to work with different generations. Millennials need different motivation than older workers. They respond to collaboration over command. They want to understand the why behind policies.

Embrace the change. Millennials aren‚Äôt a problem to solve. They‚Äôre an opportunity to capture. Restaurants that adapt will thrive. Those who resist will struggle with empty tables and revolving door staffing.

Your competition is adapting. The question is whether you‚Äôll join them or fall behind.

1nwcbht,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nwcbht/the_thing_in_the_guest_room/,The Thing in the Guest Room,"I‚Äôm not sure where to start with this, but I need to get it out. Maybe typing it here will help me process what happened, or maybe someone out there has experienced something similar. I don‚Äôt know. I just know I‚Äôm scared, and I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that it‚Äôs not over.

This happened about a week ago, and I haven‚Äôt slept properly since. My girlfriend, Sarah, and I live in a small house just outside town. It‚Äôs old, creaky, but cozy enough for the two of us. We‚Äôve been here about a year, and nothing weird ever happened until last Tuesday.

We had a friend, Mike, staying with us for a few days. He was passing through on a road trip and needed a place to crash. No big deal‚Äîwe‚Äôve got a spare room with a pull-out couch, so we told him to make himself at home. Mike‚Äôs a good guy, laid-back, not the type to make stuff up or get spooked easily. That‚Äôs why what he told us the first night freaked me out so much.

We were all hanging out in the living room, eating pizza and catching up. It was late, maybe 11 p.m., when Mike said he was beat and headed to the guest room. Sarah and I stayed up for another hour or so, watching some dumb show on Netflix before we went to bed. Around 2 a.m., I woke up to the sound of footsteps in the hallway. Heavy ones, not like Sarah‚Äôs usual tiptoeing when she gets up for water. I figured it was Mike, maybe going to the bathroom or grabbing a snack.

But the footsteps didn‚Äôt stop. They just kept pacing‚Äîback and forth, back and forth‚Äîright outside our bedroom door. I lay there, listening, waiting for them to stop or for a door to open, but it was just this steady, deliberate pacing. After a few minutes, I nudged Sarah awake and whispered, ‚ÄúDo you hear that?‚Äù

She frowned, still half-asleep, and listened. Her eyes widened a little. ‚ÄúYeah. Is that Mike?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I whispered back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll check.‚Äù

I got out of bed, heart pounding, and grabbed the baseball bat we keep under the bed. (Yeah, I know, clich√©, but we live in a rural area, and it makes me feel better.) I opened the bedroom door, bat in hand, and peeked into the hallway. It was dark, but the moonlight coming through the window at the end of the hall gave me enough light to see. There was nothing there. No Mike, no shadow, nothing. The pacing had stopped the second I opened the door.

I checked the guest room, easing the door open as quietly as I could. Mike was passed out on the pull-out, snoring softly, his phone still in his hand like he‚Äôd fallen asleep scrolling. I closed the door and checked the rest of the house‚Äîkitchen, living room, bathroom. Everything was normal, doors locked, windows shut. I told myself it was just the house settling or maybe I‚Äôd imagined it. Old houses make noises, right?

The next morning, Mike was up before us, making coffee in the kitchen. He looked rough, like he hadn‚Äôt slept much. I asked him if he‚Äôd been up in the night, maybe walking around. He gave me a weird look and said, ‚ÄúNah, man, I was out cold. Why?‚Äù

I told him about the footsteps. Sarah chimed in, saying she‚Äôd heard them too. Mike‚Äôs face went pale, and he set his mug down a little too hard. ‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs creepy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBecause I heard something last night too.‚Äù

He told us he‚Äôd woken up around 3 a.m. to what he thought was someone whispering. Not loud, just a low, constant murmur coming from the corner of the guest room. He couldn‚Äôt make out any words, but it sounded‚Ä¶ urgent, he said. Like someone was trying to tell him something important but couldn‚Äôt quite get it out. He‚Äôd turned on the lamp, and the whispering stopped. He didn‚Äôt see anything in the room, but he said the air felt ‚Äúwrong,‚Äù like it was too heavy, too still. He didn‚Äôt sleep much after that.

Sarah and I exchanged looks. We‚Äôre not superstitious people, but this was starting to feel off. I tried to laugh it off, saying maybe the house was just messing with us, but it didn‚Äôt land. We all felt uneasy.

That night, we decided to leave the hallway light on, just in case. Mike said he was fine sleeping in the guest room again, but he looked nervous. Sarah and I went to bed around midnight, and I don‚Äôt know when I fell asleep, but I woke up to the sound of Mike yelling.

I bolted out of bed, Sarah right behind me, and we ran to the guest room. Mike was sitting up on the couch, wide-eyed, clutching the blanket to his chest. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something in here,‚Äù he said, his voice shaking. ‚ÄúI saw it.‚Äù

He pointed to the corner of the room‚Äîthe same corner he‚Äôd heard the whispering from the night before. He said he‚Äôd woken up to that same heavy, murmuring sound, but this time, when he turned on the lamp, he saw something. A shape, he said, like a person but not quite. It was tall, too tall for the room, and it didn‚Äôt have a clear outline. Just this blurry, dark mass that seemed to soak up the light. He said it was standing in the corner, watching him, and when he screamed, it just‚Ä¶ melted into the wall.

I didn‚Äôt know what to say. Sarah grabbed his arm and pulled him out of the room, and we all ended up in the living room, sitting on the couch with every light in the house on. Mike was shaking, and honestly, I wasn‚Äôt much better. Sarah kept asking if he was sure he hadn‚Äôt been dreaming, but he swore up and down he was awake. ‚ÄúI know what I saw,‚Äù he kept saying. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt a dream.‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt go back to sleep that night. Mike grabbed his stuff and left at dawn, saying he‚Äôd rather sleep in his car than stay another night. I didn‚Äôt blame him. After he left, Sarah and I tried to talk it out, figure out what was going on. We checked the guest room, looked for anything that could‚Äôve caused it‚Äîbad wiring, a draft, anything. Nothing. The room looked normal, just an old couch, a lamp, and a small dresser. But it felt‚Ä¶ off. Like the air was too thick, just like Mike had described.

We haven‚Äôt used the guest room since. We keep the door closed, and I avoid walking past it at night. But last night, I heard the pacing again. Slow, heavy footsteps, back and forth in the hallway. I didn‚Äôt wake Sarah this time. I didn‚Äôt get up to check. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, listening until it stopped just before dawn.

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in this house, but it‚Äôs not just old creaks or our imagination. Something‚Äôs here, and I think it‚Äôs been here longer than we have. We‚Äôre looking for a new place to rent, but it‚Äôs hard to find something we can afford. Until then, we‚Äôre stuck here, and I‚Äôm terrified of what might happen if we stay too long.

Has anyone else dealt with something like this? I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm asking for‚Äîadvice, I guess, or just to know I‚Äôm not crazy. I keep thinking about that shape Mike saw, and I wonder if it‚Äôs watching us even now. If it‚Äôs waiting.

Anyway, let's see if we will work out. To set expectations, I'm willing to travel to your location as long as it's not far away than Manila or Quezon City Areas. If you're from Tarlac or Pangasinan, all the better.

**For both of our safety:** I will be posting a DOWNLOAD link for some of my (SFW) pictures here. Just so you really know what I look like and that you can trust me. So if you still want me based on those pictures, just simply DM me. If you don't, then don't bother sending me a DM anymore since we'll end up just wasting both of our time since I might not even be your type. So please, don't bother if you think we will not vibe. Don't worry, I will NOT be asking you for nude photos or videos and please don't ask me for those as well. Also, do not worry, I will NOT ghost you or abandon you out of nowhere. A real man MUST ALWAYS be honest and upfront, so expect me to be honest with you rather than leaving you hanging and I expect you to do the same. This is to filter out scammers and frauds out there. I want you and me to be safe and I want us both to enjoy this experience. So safety first!

\- Very Organized - I always mark important events in my calendar  
\- Very Time-Sensitive and hates ""Filipino Time"" - Whenever I plan things with someone, I always make sure to BE THERE ON TIME. This is true not just for my dating prospects, but my friends as well.  
\- Values Loyalty (A real man must ALWAYS be loyal to his lady)  
\- Certified Dog and Cat-lover (I can't help but pet and play with every dog or cat I see in the streets)  
\- Has a severe case of Cuteness Proximity (I like cute things - hoomans, puppies, kittens, hamsters, hedgehogs, etc.)  
\- Willing to travel - as long as it's NOT far away than Manila or Quezon City Areas

**About You:**

\- Age 20-34 (It depends. If we vibe well, I can accept you even if you're older than me)  
\- Fit, Curvy or THICC Body Types (It's just my personal preference so please don't take it personally. I'm just NOT attracted to chubby or plus-sized women)  
\- Preferably, shorter or equal to my height  
\- Must be STD/HIV FREE  
\- Must have your own job. If you don't have work at the moment, don't worry, I can still date you as long as you're NOT going to ask me for money or loans, and you're willing to look for work later on  
\- Must have no connections to any ex-boyfriends anymore (I prefer relationships that are drama-free and no one bothering us)  
\- Preferably, someone who does NOT smoke, in the process of quitting smoking, or has quit smoking altogether (I HATE the smell of cigarettes)|  
\- Drinking Alcohol is fine as long as you're NOT an alcoholic/addict  
\- Must be willing to really show interest and not waste time (this goes to what I said above. If you can't reply to messages within 24-48 hours, say so instead of staying silent or else that's considered GHOSTING and I'll say my goodbyes to you)  
\- Must NOT be too nonchalant (If you don't really care about getting together and being my date, why are you even here?)  
\- Must not be too sensitive (I love making people laugh so if you're the type to easily get offended, we're NOT gonna get along)  
\- Hopefully, you're also a dog or cat-lover  
\- Hopefully, you also value loyalty  
\- Hopefully, you also have good libido (This is non-negotiable for me. bedroom chemistry is extremely important in a relationship. If you are boring in bed and have low bedroom drive, we're NOT gonna get along)

For anyone interested, feel free to send me DMs any time! I admit this might come off as a job application but that's only because I don't want any scammers or fraud ruining our experience. After all, we all want genuine connections at the end of the day. I'll do my best to accommodate you.

Most of the time it was just normal stuff about teamwork, deadlines, whatever. But one Monday morning he walks in looking way too serious, like he had just stayed up all night watching TED Talks, and tells us all to gather around.

He starts off with ‚Äúlife is like spaghetti.‚Äù I swear the whole room just looked at each other like‚Ä¶ huh?

Then he launches into this whole rant about how spaghetti looks like a mess on a plate, but if you twirl it the right way it becomes something beautiful. He‚Äôs literally pretending to hold a fork in the air while explaining how we‚Äôre the sauce, the company is the pasta, and together we make the perfect dish.

But he doesn‚Äôt stop there. He goes on about how sometimes you drop a noodle on the floor and that‚Äôs okay, you don‚Äôt stop eating just because of one noodle, you make another one. He kept saying that‚Äôs how life works, like it was some deep revelation.

By this point half of us were trying not to laugh and the other half looked like they were questioning every career choice that led them there. He wrapped it up by saying we should all ‚Äúbe the spaghetti we want to see in the world.‚Äù

The best part is everyone spent the rest of the week messing with him. People left boxes of pasta on his desk, taped sticky notes on the coffee pot that said ‚Äúboil your problems away,‚Äù stuff like that.

It‚Äôs been years and every time I see spaghetti I still think about that speech.",3,1759430719.0,coworkerstories,3,0.81,False

I would prefer semi-auto, and a grinder set-up, but can compromise on this for a super-auto *if* there is a model that can actually pull a shot comparable to what I can get from a good cafe.

On that note, one I did see that could possibly be a reasonable compromise was the Illy X1 Pod and Ground machine... If anyone has used that before?

Trying my best to do it justice, and am just totally lost on accent chairs haha. So far I've only bought this mossy-green MCM style sofa with wood legs.

My current set-up is having the sofa face the window, and I'm thinking of adding two (matching?) accent chairs on the other side, with a coffee table (wood, square?) in the middle. But I just have no idea what colors would work well here, how big, if they should be matching, etc. Legs or no legs, style, size -- there's just so many options! Just would like to have it looking bright but sophisticated.

Would love any suggestions on what you think would work well here! I'm also thinking maybe a low, elongated bookshelf or reading bench alongside underneath the window? And the painting will likely change too. Thank you guys in advance!!",3,1759430601.0,HomeDecorating,2,1.0,False

We finally managed to get into the blackbox, thanks to a PC workshop run by a kind old man named Mr. Koyukuk. Check him out, not sponsored. They gave us some general info on the materials from what they could gather. The glass and metal used were octuple layers of Panzerglass and Tungsten respectively, in fitting with my original hypothesis that this was some weird time capsule. I recognised both, one from my phone‚Äôs protective membrane, one from the trekking pole that started all this. This is probably why it took so long so crack it open in the first place.

We finally got into blackbox as well! There were two memory cards, one who's contents we haven't yet managed to transfer to a normal PC which Mr. Koyukuk suggested could hold the files used for this program the thing was running and one that we did manage to partially transfer to a normal PC which held an unfathomably long word log. 33 terabytes of just words. This thing practically zip bombed Mr. Koyukuk‚Äôs poor old PC, but through patience he managed to extract it all as a file that could be compressed and opened. Let‚Äôs just say it's really not what any of us were expecting. 

We'll try to keep working on it, Mr. Koyukuk agreed to halve his pay if it meant keeping the thing afterward and we agreed, at this rate I just wanna know the story of what happened here. Bellow‚Äôs a copy paste of all we managed to extract from the text file so far. As with last time I‚Äôll update y‚Äôall as we manage to extract more of the files and will include as much on each update as I can. Until then.


‚ÄúWhite. Snow.

Sticks. Trees.

Glass. Waterstained glass.

Something soft‚Äôs under my butt and on my spine. It‚Äôs a seat? Something elastic‚Äôs over my waist. Seatbelt. My elbow hurts slightly on something cold and hard, it's the window‚Äôs edge. I'm sitting in a bus, it feels weird to have given such a mundane situation this much though, as if my brain's processing it all bit by bit. My name is Wyatt Brooks. Duh, I mean I‚Äôm not the sharpest but damn I feel slow today. That thought calls out to an infinite number of other thoughts relating to myself, all dripping down along a ghostly chain anchored in my brain. It feels like the world and I are slowly being constructed from a cloud of concepts. My every thought is echoed after I think it, but slower, as if they're being written down. I really need to sleep.

I look to the seat next to me. It's a guy. My brain starts placing his features. Teenager, dark hair, blue eyes. Franklin. All thoughts relating to Franklin snake their way to my brain again. One of them overpowers everything. I have the biggest crush on Franklin. My body grows warm, thawing from the stuttery stupor I was in just moments earlier. The feeling of my dry sweatshirt brushing up against the hair on my chest and stomach and my parka brushing up against my dry sweatshirt stings me.

My brain‚Äôs caught up with my tired body. The noise in this bus hits me, dozens of boomboxes duking it out, it's the noise of a field trip. I was lucky to grab these two seats for me and Franklin on the back. We'll be staying at this hotel for just a day to see the Northern Lights at night then head back and hit a couple of national parks along the way. I don't remember anything they told us about it other than it was optional and it was Franklin who asked me to go, I would never have the courage to ask him. Right now we're surprisingly good friends, we‚Äôve been this way since Fall, both freshmen and all. A lot of stuff has been implied by us both but neither of us have acted yet, we'd probably be a base farther down the line if my hormones would just behave, I regret. I hate the way I think of him sometimes, without clothes. I shouldn't think of him that way, not yet.

Bootclad footsteps click towards us, it's a friend. It's Abigail. Her dad's weathered old leather jacket hugs her like his ghost reaching down from Heaven, matching the black of her wolfcut. 

‚ÄúSave a seat for me?‚Äù

She asks playfully. No. It took this much willpower to sign the waver that said I‚Äôd be sharing a room with Franklin, don't take this away from me, not now I think in the split second before I realize how polite it‚Äôd be.

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

Franklin reassures her with a smile. His voice is like heroin. Bad thought, heroin is bad. I'm thinking too deeply about this, I like his voice and that's it. No, why do I like it?

‚ÄúWyatt?‚Äù

He acknowledged me.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

I reply duly. I feel dumb. I should have said more.

‚ÄúYou good big guy? Sleep late‚Äù

Abigail‚Äôs jokey voice ruins the echo of Franklin‚Äôs acknowledgement of me. I‚Äôve never hated her more. Bad thought, she's a good friend. Her smile drops a little after a bit of looking at my unflinchingly tired sleepless face. We had to wake up at 6 AM today to be picked up by the bus, now it's probably around 7:00, I calculate.

‚ÄúYeah Just tired.‚Äù

My voice sucks. It's deep but it's sickly. Not only now, always. Not like Franklin's. His is a rich rasp like black coffee. I want to feel it whispering on the back of my naked neck. Bad thought, stop it.

‚ÄúYou should probably go back to sleep.‚Äù

He nods at me. His smile shatters me. I want to cry, but I'm too tired.

‚ÄúYou're right. Night.‚Äù

I shift in my seat. I shut my eyes and head rests on the back of my hand as my elbow contorts painfully to sit on the edge of the window.

‚ÄúGoodnight!‚Äù

He pats my shoulder. Stop. This is creepy, you're creepy, I'm creepy. My heart beats a violent tattoo of his name into my throat. What if they hear it? Stop.

‚ÄúDamn, is he alright?‚Äù

I can hear Abigail whispering to him. ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, I think to grumble from my nap. That would be funny, that would make him laugh. I love his laugh. Stop. Fuck. Stop.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always like that. Great guy, just needs to get like, 110% more shuteye?‚Äù

He whispers back and laughs. I want this fucking bus to swallow me whole. This corner is my rightful place, his voice torturing me while my eyes are forced to abstain from his face. When I hit puberty my dad warned me it would get melodramatic real quick, this is probably it. I slip back into this corner between asleep and awake, hopefully when I wake up we'll be there. A guilt springs within me. Guilt that my fear is keeping me from happiness, this ride is probably gonna be so fun for him and Astrid. Come on, sleep.

The frost on the window bites at the pinkish tip of my nose. My eyes creak open. It's definitely morning, my body feels slightly better so I must have slept. But the sky shows little signs of time‚Äôs marching. This weird echoing in my brain‚Äôs still there, fine I guess I'm mentally ill now. I shoot a look behind me. She's still there, she's chatting with him. I should join.

‚ÄúHad a good nap sleepyhead?‚Äù

He acknowledged me again. His tone is too kind.

‚ÄúI think. What‚Äôd you two do?‚Äù

I try to add a little more briar to my voice, I I think I did good. But I can't think great right now.

‚ÄúKinda just talking about the hotel. I looked it up, five whole stars. They got a sauna too.‚Äù

Abigail pricks at me. I try to steer the topic into cloudy weather, I need to get more comfortable around Franklin. Ever since I started feeling this way towards him it feels like our friendship‚Äôs grown too distant, if I want to take this further I should close that gap.

‚ÄúWhat's the woods around the hotel look like? It's not in a town or city, right?‚Äù

I ask Abigail.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty plain honestly, just snowfields and the occasional birch. And you're right it's more like a natural retreat, there's a town in like two hours.""

This is an amount of talking I‚Äôm happy with for now.

‚ÄúYou guys wanna go check it out? It's not much from what Abigail showed me but you look like you could use the fresh air.‚Äù

Wyatt gestures to me. I process this far better than I would have four hours ago.

‚ÄúGreat idea.‚Äù

I give him the nicest smile I can. He smiles back, his eyes join his mouth. It's genuine. A towering hotel scrolls into the view outside my window as the bus takes a pivot and drives towards it.

‚ÄúAlot bigger than in the photos.‚Äù

Abigail jumps in. It's a strange building. There's no Christmas decorations. It's just a white wooden tower with a roof and windows. Like outsider art of a hotel‚Äôs growing pains as it turns into a sanitarium. The bus stops abruptly, the engine shutting down as the doors open and other kids rush to get out. I can still hear the noise of the engine from that same part of my brain where all my thoughts are echoing from.

‚ÄúDude?‚Äù

Franklin taps my shoulder. Was I thinking that long? He‚Äôs holding out my luggage to me. I grab it quickly in embarrassment and thank him. Almost too quickly I worry, he looks to have been knocked a little off balance. We march outside. Abigail's leather boots carve a safe path for me and Franklin‚Äôs weak little canvas sneakers. We‚Äôre quickly herded into the front door, cloaked in shadow under a stone terrace. The lobby is bathed in a blue and green glow dripping from the tinted windows, it's weirdly serene in place of the almost Foucaultist, sterile pale lighting most hotels opt for. The rocky paleo decor digs up a joke about what Bj√∂rk‚Äôs bathroom probably looks like and I burst out laughing in it's memory despite my best try at suppressing it. Apparently it's infectious.

‚ÄúWhat's so funny?‚Äù

Franklin looks up at me curiously, a shaky laugh under his voice. I forgot how much taller I am than him. I wanna ruffle his black hair so much. Oh stop, you were doing great.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you later.‚Äù

I shut my laughter up with one last chortle. I‚Äôve been told I have a bony laugh. I let that insecurity flow away, it's not annoying to Franklin and Abigail. That's all that matters. Quickly we‚Äôre given our keys and sent up to our rooms with our keys, my basketball coach letting us all know when to gather for lunch. The corridor walls are cosily dark, a black that hugs you in how tight it makes a space look. The carpet on our shoes is snow white, the manager must have some absolutely unholy beef with the cleaning ladies. The door to our room greets us as we ascend the strairs.

‚ÄúCall me when you're done, loseeers‚Ä¶‚Äù

Abigail breaks us up and gestures a phone call, disappearing behind a corner.

‚Äú...Sorry!‚Äù

She bumps into a girl coming the other way. Franklin gives a faint laugh, then pulls his key from the pocket and twists the lock open. I like the way his hands move. Our room is alot tinier than I thought, I didn't really look into it. The walls are that same comfortable black as the halls, painted on squared stone, thought the effect is somewhat ruined by the whole eastern wall being a window. Two beds. Bittersweet.

‚ÄúYou wanna unpack later? I don't feel like staying in my room all morning.‚Äù

Yeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don't like it?‚Äù

My attempt at banter comes out a bit too sincere.

‚ÄúOh no, it's nice and all. I just wanna go see the tundra is all.‚Äù

He cranes his neck wistfully to the window. I feel weirdly okay with how close we are right now. He always put his one foot above his knee when he sits. Oh, right.

‚ÄúYou should switch shoes, mine are still soaked from the snow. Do you have boots with you?‚Äù

I ask, trying to sound thoughtful. If I really love him should it not have come to me to say that naturally? I don't have time to figure out what came to me naturally, his mouth‚Äôs opening to talk.

‚ÄúAw, no. I guess I didn't think we‚Äôd go out at all.‚Äù

My brain racks itself. I can't just not go on a romantic walk in the tundra with him.

‚ÄúYou can borrow mine.‚Äù

When I first got those boots on my birthday we immediately went for coffee afterwards and I forgot them at our table. When I rushed back to get them one of the baristas was jokingly asking who the sasquatch was who forgot his new kicks. I don't know what Franklin's shoe size is but it's probably smaller than US 14.

‚ÄúSorry I forgot, they may be too big for you.‚Äù

I try to cushion my folly before it lands.

‚ÄúWell it's better than nothing.‚Äù

I try to not look as rushed as I am while looking for the boots. I toss out technical books and freshly washed clothes and packs of cigarettes until I finally reach the bottom of my backpack, pulling out a platic Kwik Trip bag with the two boots caught in it and throwing it to Franklin.

‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù

His smile reaches his pretty blue eyes.

‚ÄúI should go freshen up. I'll be in the bathroom.‚Äù

I get up quickly, almost spilling the contents of my backpack to the ground.

‚ÄúI won't be long.‚Äù

I rush into the bathroom and shut the door behind me with more force than I meant to. Fuck. This probably looks so bad. I don't have time for that though.

The bathroom, ironically, is the part of the hotel that reminds me the least of that joke about Bj√∂rk's bathroom. The tall square mirror at the heart of it reflects me. I can't go out like this. My thin face looks crushed, my curly bed hair‚Äôs only gotten worse from my nap in the bus, my glasses are sliding off my hooked nose from all the cold sweat. In the silence, I realize the the roar of the engine still echoes in the back of my brain. Fuck. I frantically take off my clothes, they smell like my nicotine addiction. I need a shower. Cold water? Cold water is best right now, yeah. I need all the energy I can get. I climb in and turn the dial to the coldest it can go. The freezing water prickles my skin, drowning out the engine‚Äôs echo. My every pore screaming I am alive, I want to be alive. This is all just social stress, hang in there Wyatt. One day, you‚Äôll look back at this stay and smile. You‚Äôll think, this is weekend I finally told the love of my life.

‚ÄúFUCK!‚Äù

I wail. The engine‚Äôs echo ignites into a violent revving. A pixelated voice laughs in my brain. I instinctively cover my ears, slipping in the shower and hitting my ribs on the porcelain floor. The stream of cold water from above anchors me. The pixelated voice dissolves into an unfathomably loud crying. It's so crunched it sounds like a snuff film involving a chainsaw blasting out of a thousand out of sync Ataris.

‚ÄúTURN OFF COMMUNICATION.‚Äù

The crying shifts sharply into a clear but deafening utterance of those three words. Both echoes cut off with an abruptness that leaves my brain hurting infinitely more than both did. I burst into tears from the pain.

‚ÄúWyatt?!‚Äù

I muster the strength in my throat to yell at him before he opens the door.

‚ÄúDON'T COME IN! PLEASE!‚Äù

I can't let him see me like this. I sit like this for minutes, letting the water wash the pain from my body. After all the shampoo dissolves from my hair, I try my best to get up. Surprisingly, I can. I grab the towel from the sink and pat myself dry, then wrap it around my head and trying to scramble my scalp awake like hitting a hamster in a sock against a wall. What the fuck was that? I have no time for doctors right now, but I need one and soon. I let out the heaviest sigh I've ever let out and wrap the towel around my waist. Yeah, this‚Äôll make me look confident. I exit the bathroom. Franklin looks at me, his eyes drowned in worry.

‚ÄúI slipped, it's nothing.‚Äù

I laugh it off. My ribs flare with pain.

‚ÄúYou sure dude? You look hurt.‚Äù

I look down at my chest where a blue bruise is spreading like a texture loading in. It's not nothing. This is going to hurt like a motherfucker in the cold we‚Äôre about to head into.

‚ÄúYeah. Let me just get dressed.‚Äù

I‚Äôd be worried about the pain showing in my voice if the cigarettes hadn't already made it sound like that. I grab the warmest clothes I can find and rush back into the bathroom, this time taking care to not close the door like it owes me money. I'm gaining my humor back, that's good.

I slip on a black sweater and a pair of gray jeans. The water droplets on my torso soak into the fabric as they coat me.  Now for the hard part, putting on socks with wet feet. Don't rip. Don't rip. Don't rip. Alright, good. I don't have the time to tie my shoelaces, I tuck them in the sides of my sneakers. I violently stuff my arms into my parka like an alien parasite and rush out the bathroom. He's sitting on his bed, taking out clothes from his bag. He looks at me, there's still a little concern in his eyes.

‚ÄúReady?‚Äù

He grabs his Walkman and a pair of headphones. A tape of that weird British band‚Äôs album with the square face on the cover is lying on his bed.

‚ÄúYeah, let's go.‚Äù

I quickly walk up to the door and open it, making sure to let him pass first before following him into the hallway.

‚ÄúAck, sorry I‚Ä¶‚Äù

He takes a bit. I should ask if I can help.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

Good job and bonus points for the worried tone.

‚ÄúNothing, I just didn't put on enough clothes for this weather I realize.‚Äù

Oh my God. I'm gonna get to give him my parka.

‚ÄúYou can borrow my parka if you want, I'll be okay with just this.‚Äù

I pick at my maillike sweater.

‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù

He asks, as per social law of being offered anything for free.

‚ÄúYeah, you only have a shirt and a jacket. You'll turn into a frozen TV dinner out there.‚Äù

He gives me a smile. He does that alot actually, is it just the stay he‚Äôs excited for?

‚ÄúThank you, Wyatt.‚Äù

He could've just said ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù but he didn't. He said my name. As we climb down the stairs I see the same lobby we stood in just an hour earlier, polished wood and rock in all shades of black and white and gray. It all feels like a corner in a cabin‚Äôs attic.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna go to the bathroom real quick. Abigail should be here soon, just texted her.‚Äù

I watch as be walks into a white hallway off the side of the front desk, turning around after I realise how weird I'm being. 

I should sit on the couch, it‚Äôll make me look less like his lapdog. It's quite stiff despite looking like a giant plushie. I sprawl my arms around it to look cool for when he comes out the bathroom. I should ask if there‚Äôs an infirmary or something in this place, I gotta get checked for whatever happened in the bathroom. I know sleep deprivation, that was not that. An accented voice whistles at me.

‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

It's a guy sitting on the other couch. He's pretty fit and wearing only a tank top and shorts. Clearly not local, he sounds English.

‚ÄúUm, hi.‚Äù

His cologne reaches me all the way here. It's so acidic. Fuck do I not wanna talk to this person.

‚ÄúWhat's up?‚Äù

He's really going for it. Fuck.

‚ÄúLook, I'm not interested. I have a guy I‚Äôm actually interested in meaningfully. I don't need to fuck around like this.‚Äù

I puff my chest and try to sound as strong as possible. My bruise strings.

‚Äú‚ÄòAve you ever even tried it? You don't look it.‚Äù

He scoffs smugly.

‚ÄúFuck off.‚Äù

I get up and look for a better place to sit. This guy has guts I‚Äôll give him that, this is a public space.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not fooling anyone, mate. You could just once if you wanna be so pure or whatever, you know? ‚ÄúGet it out the system.‚Äù sort of deal.‚Äù

A tiny part of my brain stops and thinks about this. That part is insane, stop. How could you even give this thought? Familiar bootsteps echo in the lobby, muffled by white carpet.

‚ÄúWhat's up?‚Äù

Abigail sits down beside me, wrapping an arm around my shoulder. She's wearing her leather jacket properly now, still open for style points.

‚ÄúNothing, let's go.‚Äù

I raise my neck and get up. I hear footsteps coming from the hallway the bathroom was in, thank fuck. The English sex pest scoffs at me again as Franklin comes up to me and Abigail. He checks his watch.

‚ÄúWe have two hours ‚Äòtill lunch. I think that should be good.‚Äù

In almost lockstep we all walk out the revolving front door. This space between the lobby and the Alaskan wilderness feels oddly comfy. Abigail pulls the door knob open and a wall of still frost rains down on my freshly showered hair. It creeps it's way under my parka and in between the weaving of my sweater, cooling the wet deodorant in my armpits. Right. I take off my parka and hand it to Franklin.

‚ÄúAlmost forgot. Here you go.‚Äù

He quickly coats himself in it as we step out the front road and turn to the tundra. It's at least three sizes too big.

‚ÄúThanks again.‚Äù

This is nice. It feels like what I was robbed of during that shower. Quiet. My sneakers are getting absolutely soaked in the snow, but that's ok. I‚Äôll let them dry near a radiator later. Woken up by the cold, my brain lets all the thoughts of all the things in the world around me flow through it, not filtering them out in fear of overheating, not rushing to get to safety anymore. This is safety. I look at both of them next to me, the tiredness still droopping from their eyes but not polluting their bright faces. The deeper we walk into the tundra the blurrier the white sky looks, rendering all life under it in a dreamy slow motion. I can almost hear the trees‚Äô biorhythm whirring around us like song. It sounds a little like the engine I was hearing earlier. Fuck, stop it.

I hear the clicking of plastic. Franklin‚Äôs fiddling with his Walkman, clipping it to the chest of his shirt under his parka. Well, my parka.

‚ÄúI only brought one album, sorry. Not very fitting for with this scenery either, thought I don't listen to much that would be.‚Äù

He jokes at us. I catch a knowing look on Abigail's face as she glances at the tape in Franklin's hands.

‚ÄúThose guys? I'm not that depressed yet.‚Äù

She scoffs. I wait for Franklin's response to see if I should actually laugh or not. Maybe I am a lapdog.

‚ÄúThey have some happier songs too. It's not all about Bela Lugosi being dead. One of them on this album reminds me a lot of you.‚Äù

He smiles at her too. It's so damn infectious.

‚ÄúShe's in paaarties~‚Äù

I hum, clinging onto the conversation as the gloomy track starts up. Distorted bass breaks up the silence and accents my every footstep with an electronic dot. I try to catch up with their brisk pace, I walk slow despite my tall stride length. The trees around us hack the world up like pencil lines on paper. My dad came from a broken home and he always told me to enjoy these years as much as I could. I get it now. No matter what happens after graduation, this one fixed point in time existed when we were all happy together. Intangible but immortal proof that these three people once cared for one another.

‚ÄúSave. Turn off communication.‚Äù

I twist my neck in confusion. It whispered from my brain again, that voice from the shower. It wasn‚Äôt insane sounding like earlier, it sounded deflated. It sounded like all of dad's friends who warn me from experience to smoke less.

‚ÄúWhat's with you today?‚Äù

Franklin shoots a weirded look at me, then Abigail. His curiosity overpowers his concern.

‚ÄúI just need a good sleep. I‚Äôve slept six hours in two days and my motor instincts are all fucked.‚Äù

I brush it off. Please don't be weirded out.

‚ÄúShould we‚Ä¶go back? We can come out here again tomorrow when you feel better.‚Äù

I straighten my spine and try my best to look at healthy as I can.

‚ÄúNo, really. I'm good.‚Äù

My voice comes out way clearer. That's good.

‚ÄúIf you're sure. By the way, I haven't forgotten about what happened in the lobby. What were you laughing about?‚Äù

He stretches while he asks this, glancing back at our footsteps and turning fully around.

‚ÄúOh we're real far.‚Äù

He checks his watch. It looks so nice on him, what with the spotted white clock and black strap.

‚ÄúWe got ten minutes to lunch.‚Äù

He shoots a scaredy look at Abigail. She shoots a triumphant look back.

‚ÄúAbby, don't. If not for me for Wyatt, he's a walking corpse right now.‚Äù

It's strange how awful those words would sound out of anyone else's mouth.

‚ÄúAlright, you win nerds. No racing.‚Äù

She puts her hands up, folding them up behind her head as we walk back to the hotel. I needed this.

‚ÄúWe haven't forgotten jokester.‚Äù

Abigail taps my shoulder quickly.

‚ÄúOh right. Well it's just the decor in the lobby reminded me of this joke. Looking back it's kinda stupid.‚Äù

I humbly abstain from telling it right away.

‚ÄúLet's hear it!‚Äù

Yes, thank you Abigail.

‚ÄúI think it was ‚ÄúGetting lost hiking in Europe is not knowing if you've just stepped into WEF‚Äôs evil hideout, a post Soviet playground or Bj√∂rk's bathroom.‚Äù

Abigail chuckles just a little, but Franklin folds in half, howling with laughter. He laughs so breathily, like a dog whining with joy.

‚ÄúAlright that was good.‚Äù

It's my favorite sound in the whole world.With one last forlon step in thsnow, I push open the revolving door to the lobby. All the water squeezing out of my sneakers with every step suddenly threatens to send me sliding onto the shiny rock floor. I take it as slow as I can, finally reaching the carpet on the stairs.

‚ÄúLunch is down in the lobby, big guy.‚Äù

Abigail calls to me from under the stairs.

‚ÄúI should really sleep, eating beforehand ruins your body's ability to heal itself. Save some snacks for me in a napkin and we'll meet at dinner.‚Äù

I smile and wave at both of them, and they both smile and wave at me as I take my leave. I remember mom's dating advice that bordered on political games, ‚ÄúMake yourself unavailable. Your time should feel like a luxury.‚Äù 

It's more than that cheap trick though, I do genuinely need a good sleep. Eight hours from now will be night, but not too late in the night. Maybe I could take him somewhere, Abigail mentioned a sauna. I scramble for my key in my jeans‚Äô pocket and twists open the doorknob to me and Franklin‚Äôs room.

I quickly dress down to my briefs, take off my shoes and prop them up against the radiator, stuff my socks in them, and put on whatever shirt I have that's most pyjamalike. I jump into bed. My half awake body buries itself under the sheets with animalistic instinct, alaying. I want to shut my eyes immediately, but a thought swims up into my brain. That English guy at the lobby. All my worst parts hold a council to consider his offer. Stop it. Why am I constantly fighting my brain today? I wish it was that voice again, it just gives me headaches. This is something awful, a corruption of the purest thing in my life, my love of Franklin. It's so infinitely much more than what that English guy's offering and I know it, but in the comfort of the freshly cleaned hotel sheets the thought refuses to die. Stop. Stop. Stop‚Ä¶""",1,1759430509.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I am a grad student in my last semester. I've tried to get a job for 2 years with absolutely no luck. Tutoring has gone well, but I don't have any income over summer or holidays. I'm a single adult woman without family help. I received my final payout last month, $15000, and I was given a kind extension on rent by the company for 5 months. This leaves me $6700 to pay if I am to avoid eviction. They have threatened to start the eviction process if I don't pay it all at once. DC has great renter's rights laws; it'd be a long and expensive process on their side.

To preface the situation: the apartment is a tiny, shared space impacted with the 5 of us (6th incoming); 3 African immigrants and a young American woman with moderate autism. We have private rooms which are nice and newly built. I assume I was placed here because my name is African. I'm American. The noise is constant -- screaming, extremely loud conversations, tribal chanting and praying, music, video games, sex, everything else. It goes up at 11 pm and slows down by 3am. So the #1 issue is that I never sleep, I have been sleep deprived for the entire 13 months I've been here. I will not graduate on time and have to do an extra unfunded semester due to the fact that my thesis progress has come to a standstill.

A secondary issue is the kitchen. We share a small kitchen-living room which is always occupied by a LARGE full african meal, pungent odors and racks of fermented meat odors fill everyone's bedrooms for 3 days. I've used several bottles of febreze and plugins, my purifier has helped but the lingering stench is horrid. We have NO windows. 13 hours of cooking all weekend, and then there are 7 huge containers in our one fridge. The freezer sometime stays open and melts all the food, including their giant flintstones meats. They trigger the smoke alarm every single time, 2am or 2pm. They refuse to use the dishwasher, so the sink is always piled up and the ""clean"" dishes cover our only counter space. They aren't sanitary with the ice, so every drink I have at home is warm. There is no space for my food in the fridge, but if I do leave my few (vegan) groceries in there, I will see them thrown under a giant bag of fermenting dripping meat. They also eat my food and drink my coffee and almond creamer, so that's an added expense. I've given up on using the kitchen and resorted to just eating the dry and canned ""meals"" under my bed and eating from the vending machines on campus. I've lost 14 lbs since I've moved here, and my professor was extremely concerned. I saw a doctor who said that I was under an immense amount of stress, and found lumps in my lymph nodes.

The tertiary issue is boundaries, they don't exist. If my lingerie are in the laundry, a male will dry them, fold them, and leave them on the couch. I told him directly not to touch my things, because it's my day to do laundry. He pretended I said nothing. This continues every week. They also bring my packages and mail out of the shared box, open them, and leave them on the counter (which I do not use, so it'd take me days to realize it wasn't stolen). They'll invite friends, the entire extended family, have them stay a week, and not even mention that there's a stranger sleeping in our cramped space or for how long. The ONLY way anyone communicates is via notes on my fridge whiteboard, and if they don't like the message, they erase it or respond aggressively.

Lastly, the administration does absolutely nothing. I've explained all of these problems over and over, begging for a new room, and they ignored me, just requesting more money. Wifi and maid service are included, but the barest minimum. The elevator and wifi goes out at least once weekly. I cannot WFH because my job was threatened after my students couldn't reach me. I have to go to the library to offer tutoring service.

Today, they entered with no notice (while I was at my research lab) and started showing my room to someone.

So my options here include: the eviction process (during the govt shutdown), making a hefty payment to stay here and suffering through my last 2 semesters with no sleep or food, finding a new place without income, or a combo of these. I feel like another month in this caveman frat house will end me.",1,1759430288.0,Tenant,2,1.0,False
1nwc233,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nwc233,"El Celler de Can Roca (***) - Girona, Spain","I've just returned from a trip to Girona and Barcelona, the latter of which was a return visit some 10 years in the making. During my stay, I ate at five fine dining restaurants; in order: El Celler de Can Roca (***), SUTO (*), Cocina Hermanos Torres (***), Lasarte (***), and Mont Bar (*). No Disfrutar this trip, though I'm set to return in December to...enjoy.

The most well known of these restaurants is undoubtedly El Celler de Can Roca, a restaurant that represents the culmination of the three Roca brothers' (Joan, the cook; Josep, the sommelier and Maitre D'; and Jordi, the pastry chef) cuisine, which put Girona on the culinary map when it won World's Best Restaurant in 2013, and then again in 2015 (back when restaurants weren't retired from competition after winning once, so it meant more, as far as these things do at all).

El Celler de Can Roca is inextricably intertwined with Girona. All three of the Roca brothers were born in this 2000-year old city, a city that has been conquered and reconquered throughout that history. Those may be military conquests, but in the culinary world, it is the Roca brothers that have done the conquering. 

It didn't begin with El Celler, though. Three years after eldest son Joan's birth, the father of the family, Josep (which is also the name of the middle child) opened Can Roca, a bar and restaurant on the outskirts of Girona, that is still going to this day. It is here that the brothers got a firsthand view of the hospitality business, with Joan completing his hospitality studies at the Escola d'Hospitality i Turisme de Girona in 1983 (five years after the birth of youngest son Jordi; Josep completed his studies two years after). It was in 1986 that Joan and Josep opened El Celler de Can Roca. Almost thirty years passed until the restaurant was put foremost onto the world stage, and this evolution came through Joan's formative placements with El Bulli and Georges Blanc, as well as the addition of Jordi's unfettered creativity with desserts (for an insight into the latter, the Chef's Table episode on Jordi Roca is well worth a watch).

Three is the magic number, and it is utilised again and again during a visit to El Celler de Can Roca. The dining room is in the form of a triangle, where three lanes (three sides) are separated by a glassed off courtyard; three rocks sit on each table, each differing in size, representing the three brothers and their  relative ages; and the first of the sixteen appetizers that comprise the Festival menu, consists of a 3D mould that - as three distinct volumes of liquid are poured into it - show the profiles of the three brothers in turn. This 'three-faced consomm√©' consists of a cocoa nib infusion for Jordi, mushroom broth with amontillado for Josep, and a grilled veal broth for Joan. A fun and spirited start to the meal, with the dish being an example of something that I particularly enjoyed during my visit: the move away from a completely linear menu from savoury into sweets, where instead the expertise of each brother was drawn on throughout the meal (such as the olive sorbet and gazpacho nose via Jordi, both of which were appetizers, and the wine-steamed prawn via Josep).

This was the begining of a massive menu: 16 appetizers, 12 savoury courses, 4 desserts, and petit-fours. Given the 32 courses, I've selected pictures of the twenty courses that were the most striking. This was not a difficult task, as I found that the meal was consistently good, but with only a handful of true standouts. These standouts include, from the appetizers: the frozen olive (an olive sorbet that was that was almost the essence of an olive, but with the salinity tamped down), the oyster with cava, the plankton mousse with seaweed (a wonderful bite with brine and herbaceous notes), and the foie gras nougat with cocoa (rich and decadent). The only appetizer that didn't pass muster was the squid nigiri; a nice enough idea, but it fell apart at the touch. Even as a simulacrum of a nigiri, it was unsuccessful.

From the main savoury courses, there were a greater number of exceptional dishes. The opener, the celebration of the tomato, was wonderful; various tomatoes prepared in different ways, starting with fresh and sweet at the bottom of the plate, ending in deeper umami flavours at the top. This was a journey on one plate, of one ingredient, that I would happily take again. I had to wait a few more courses for the next exceptional dish, that being the aubergine with miso and pine nuts. The miso sauce was smooth and rich, with the nuts adding a welcome textural crunch, and the aubergine acting as a perfect accompaniment, more also for its textural quality than outright flavour. This was the standout of the menu for me. Wonderful.

The final four savoury courses were all exquisite. The guinea fowl, the duck, and the seafood were all the stars of their respective dishes, and what I liked the most is the lightness of touch taken with the garnish and accompanying sauce for these dishes. 

The desserts were a little bit of a let down, as I love desserts (this is probably in part why I hold Goldfarb's Room4Dessert in such high esteem), but perhaps this is also due to great expectations going into it, given Jordi Roca's reputation. I found the apple dessert to be very fun but also very bothersome to eat (the dinosaur cutlery was unwieldy, and the lack of a knife didn't help for cutting the aerated apple strips), the autumn dish - while again fun in conception - didn't stick the landing on being harmonious in taste (it ran too acidic), and the chocolate dessert was good but was exceeded a couple of nights later by the amazing chocolate dessert at Cocina Hermanos Torres.

Overall, I enjoyed my visit to El Celler de Can Rocs, and while there was nothing here that truly fell short of the mark, I was disappointed that less than half of the menu left an indelible impression. That said, the highs that were reached were exceptionally high, and the lows were almost non-existent (most restaurants I imagine would be quite happy to attain that median level). In the end, when the napkin hits the table, there is no denying the great attention to detail and the excellent service that is on display at El Celler de Can Roca.

During the company retreat, my husband decided to bunk up in the lovers' suite with his secretary.

""My health isn't great, and I need Mr. Thompson by my side to look after me at the spa,"" she cooed.

""Aurora is so understanding‚Äîshe won't mind, right?""

My husband wrapped an arm around her waist, his tone laced with annoyance. ""Don't worry about her. If she's going to be this petty, then my feelings for her were totally misplaced!""

My colleagues, bless their hearts, chimed in. ""Exactly! If you end up with a jealous wife, it's better to bail early.""

""A man should find someone as sweet and gentle as Ms. Holmes. Mr. Thompson is one lucky dude.""

These were all people I'd personally brought into the company, and now they were openly trashing me.

Since no one here gave a damn about me, this company had no reason to exist anymore.

I texted my parents: [Stop investing. I don't want this company.]

---

Damien dragged Piper over to me, his voice sharp with impatience. ""Hand over the key card for the lovers' suite. I'm taking Piper to the spa.""

Piper clung to Damien‚Äôs arm like a limpet, flashing me a smug, provocative look. Anyone watching would swear they were the married couple.

""Thank you, Aurora. Mr. Thompson and I will make sure to have a blast!""

I stood up and handed him the key card. He snatched it, then deliberately bumped my shoulder as he strode past.

I lost my balance, stumbling back and slamming into the edge of a table. A searing pain shot up my lower back, and I couldn't stifle a gasp.

But Damien didn't even glance back.

""Piper has been working her butt off on this project, and she finally sealed the deal,"" Seth Snyder, the head of sales, stated, his eyes fixed on me like a warning.

Seriously? The contract was signed because I had spent weeks negotiating with the partners and tossed in extra incentives from my parents' company. Piper's only contribution was fetching coffee ‚Äì how did that make her the hero?

Even Shawn Mills, the tech guru, piped up, ""She's wiped out from all the recent work. She needs to recharge.""

""Aurora, don't bother her tonight. Just make sure you prep something nice for her to eat.""

Seeing how completely they'd thrown their support behind Piper sent a chill right through my bones. When Piper first joined, both these guys had been Team Aurora.

I'd lost my appetite entirely and retreated to my room.

The second I stepped inside, my phone buzzed ‚Äì Damien.

""Piper has a killer headache. Go get her some medicine, like, now! You've got five minutes to bring it to our suite.""

I replied, my voice flat and cold, ""I'm not going.""

Damien blew up. ""If you hadn't been so damn jealous and wasted our time today, Piper wouldn't be suffering like this!""

""Consider this your apology. If you don't‚Äî""

I hung up without another word, shut my eyes, and collapsed onto the bed.

Damien and I had tied the knot the second we were legal. We grew up together, and he‚Äôd passed up better opportunities just to stick by me.

He‚Äôd once vowed, ""I want to be with Aurora for the rest of my life‚Äînot a single step apart!""",1,1759430161.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1: Living Dead Girl


‚ÄúYour dead will live; their bodies will rise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust! For your dew is like the dew of the morning; the earth will give birth to her dead.‚Äù -Isaiah 26:19


‚ÄúWas that girl even alive when I shot her?‚Äù

Ben stared at the half-empty mug of stale coffee, but big surprise, the sludge didn‚Äôt answer. The room felt like it was closing in on him, its fluorescent lights buzzing and flickering like they were trying to get his attention. The floor creaked under the weight of his exhaustion, and the clock on the wall seemed to tick louder with every passing second.


He rubbed his temples, trying to focus through the haze of the gas‚Äîthe damn cave gas. It was like someone had slipped him a cocktail of industrial-strength whiskey chased by a shot of chemotherapy. The world was spinning just enough to make his thoughts feel a little detached, as though his own brain was a foreign object he was struggling to understand.


The door to the interrogation room slammed open, breaking his spiral into self-doubt. Two agents stepped inside, both wearing identical black suits that screamed ""I have connections"" and ""You‚Äôre screwed."" The pair of them were built like bouncers at a VIP club, with that same tight-lipped expression reserved for people who‚Äôve spent too long dealing with the worst humanity has to offer.


‚ÄúI‚Äôm Special Agent Dick Johnson,‚Äù the first one said, his voice as clipped as his hair. ‚ÄúThis is my partner, Richard Johnson. No relation.‚Äù 


Richard closed the door. Ben blinked. If they weren‚Äôt actually twins, they were government clones. Both were tall, broad-shouldered, with matching brown hair and piercing blue eyes. They could‚Äôve been a walking billboard for American Exceptionalism if the whole ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here to ruin your life‚Äù vibe didn‚Äôt overshadow it.


""Crease,"" Ben muttered, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. ""But I‚Äôm guessing you already knew that.""

Dick didn‚Äôt smile, though Richard‚Äîwho had been suspiciously quiet up to that point‚Äîgave a brief chuckle.

‚ÄúRichard, close the door,‚Äù Dick said, his gaze narrowing as he slid into the chair across from Ben.

Richard closed the door.


Ben blinked again, writing it off as deja vu. Leaning back in his chair Ben rubbed his face as he tried to clear the fog from his mind. The events were still a blur, fragments of chaos woven together by the scream of gunfire and the stench of something unholy. Maybe the cave gas was screwing with his memory.


Dick steepled his fingers. ‚ÄúBen, you‚Äôre in some hot water here. Why don‚Äôt you pretend we‚Äôre friends and walk us through what happened last night?‚Äù

Ben leaned in ‚ÄúYou first.‚Äù

Richard held up his hands ‚Äúmaybe we‚Äôre getting off on the wrong foot.‚Äù

Ben leaned his head to the side and scratched at the table ‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk but first, any word on my guys?‚Äù

‚ÄúDig team‚Äôs still digging,‚Äù Dick said with a voice like sandpaper.

Ben shot dick a look. ‚ÄúYou wanna try that again?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt heard anything yet,‚Äù Richard said softly.


Ben looked at Dick and decided he lived up to his name and killed the storm brewing in his throat. Besides, it wasn‚Äôt Dick who got five of his teammates buried under a mountain and the rest killed.


""We were tasked with taking down Dr. Clyde,"" Ben began. ‚ÄúClyde‚Äôs a biology and chemistry professor‚Äîbrilliant mind, bad hobbies. Detective Shultz thought he was the one behind the murders of a few students. We had his DNA under a dismembered victim's fingernails‚Äîsome bizarre experiment gone wrong, or right, depending on how you look at it. But we didn‚Äôt know the half of it.‚Äù


‚ÄúIt was a no-knock raid. Team Two would take the second story via ladder, while my team huffed, puffed, and blew down the back door. I didn‚Äôt expect the place to look like an art exhibit for mad scientists, but hey, you don‚Äôt always get what you expect. The Doc was a security freak. When we jammed his Wi-Fi cameras, it likely tipped him off. Regardless, we made entry.‚Äù


Richard interrupted. ‚ÄúSo you had no idea there was anyone else in there?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow could we?‚Äù Ben replied. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt even know about the basement.‚Äù

Dick leaned forward. ‚ÄúHow did you find the basement?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting to that.‚Äù


‚ÄúDr. Clyde‚Äôs house was exactly what you‚Äôd expect from someone who moonlighted as a psychopathic academic: big, creepy, and overly complicated. The house was shaped like a long ""L"", with the main entrance on the far side. We picked the back door‚Äôs deadbolt and moved through the dark, cluttered interior. Papers, trinkets, and instruments were scattered on every surface, giving the place an eerie, suffocating feel. Navigating through night vision, the 40-degree field of view turned every room into a labyrinth. I couldn‚Äôt have guessed there‚Äôd be an actual Minotaur.‚Äù


‚ÄúTeam Two cleared the upper floor faster‚Äîits layout was more straightforward. They reached a catwalk overlooking the front entry about ten seconds ahead of our team. After we caught up to team two, they were able to clear their way across the catwalk without fear of being exposed.‚Äù


‚ÄúWhile you were clearing your way to the entry hall, did you hear a low thunk?‚Äù Richard said, shifting in his seat.‚Äù


 ‚ÄúNothing out of the ordinary.‚Äù Ben leaned back, eyebrows furrowed. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù


Dick said, ‚ÄúPlease continue.‚Äù


‚ÄúAnyway, once Team Two was done clearing their section, they made their way down the back stairs to help us with the final push.‚Äù 


Ben Paused. ‚ÄúThat's when we found Doctor Clyde‚Äôs office. It was maybe the second-to-last room we cleared on the ground floor. The room was corner-fed and overlooked a garden in the back, which had a security element covering it. I ran the Rabbit along the wall to get in there and rammed my shoulder into a statue, knocking it over. The marble man was wearing what looked like the double lightning bolts of the SS. Once we announced all clear and the lights came on, I could see the plaque read ‚ÄúJosef Rudolf Mengele.‚Äù


‚ÄúYeah, that Josef Mengele,‚Äù Ben said. ‚ÄúThe plaque even called him ‚ÄòThe Angel of Death.‚Äô Subtle, right?‚Äù


‚ÄúWe started to toss the place in hopes of finding out where the doctor could be if not there. The office was a treasure trove of evidence. Clyde‚Äôs computer required no more than his university password to access. Files labeled ‚ÄúProject Rebirth‚Äù revealed hundreds of videos of experiments‚Äîhorrifying scenes of torture and gene editing.‚Äù


‚ÄúThere's a reason one of the victims' autopsies will reveal a recent childbirth.‚Äù


‚ÄúDoctor Clyde had no mercy,‚Äù Ben continued, his voice tightening. ‚ÄúHe tortured those people, even chopped off limbs. From what we could tell, there were around 60 victims‚Äîmost were women, but some were men.‚Äù


Dick jotted something in his notebook, his expression unreadable. 


Odd, but a moment ago, the agent didn't have a notebook on the table, nor could Ben remember him producing one.


‚ÄúMost of the videos seemed to be pointing us towards a cave. In Arkansas, that meant his lab could‚Äôve been anywhere. We caught another break when we opened a file named Thaddeus.‚Äù


‚ÄúFast-forwarding through a video of a man being subjected to a sort of gas, the camera abruptly fell, and we saw through a cave passage a light and a staircase. An unidentifiable male then picked the camera back up and pointed it back towards the victim. Rewinding the video, we saw the base of the stairs had the same sort of banisters we saw in the front entry.‚Äù


‚ÄúWe began ripping through the walls, tearing books off shelves, doing anything we could to see if it was the basement of this house.‚Äù


‚ÄúWe were in the house for a little over ten minutes when one of my guys found the entrance. The Doctor built a secret passage behind a false kitchen cabinet latched by a magnetic lock. When my teammate found the release, he alerted us, and we killed the lights in the kitchen. We dropped our nods and waited a few seconds for team two before we made our breach. Fifteen of us were stacked up and ready to regain the violence of action.‚Äù


‚ÄúWe breached it with a box of Special K that had a magnet inside. Two flashbangs went in first. A mix of overpressure and popping answered back at us. I was the second person down the stairs. The abyss smelled of ammonia and rotting meat.‚Äù


The room seemed to grow colder as Ben spoke. He continued, his voice a bit more strained, his mind slowly returning to the horrors of what they found.


‚ÄúI hit the landing, careful not to burn myself. A small fire began to cook shelving coated in an unidentified flammable liquid. The expensive-looking furniture was ignited by one of the flashbangs. I made a U-turn, activated my NGAL, and began pushing my corner of the room. That's when I saw, in the center of the wall I was moving towards, a black hole. Eyeballing it through the grey-blue night vision, the void was roughly 6 inches off the basement floor, 7 feet in height, with 5 feet in width.‚Äù


‚ÄúI heard a squeaky noise come through the hole. I could see with my IR illuminator that it opened up roughly 10 yards down the passage. The closer I stood to the entrance, the warmer the room felt. Even if we were experiencing a hotter-than-normal October, it was like someone cranked up the heat in hell.‚Äù


‚ÄúThe tunnel had black wiring running through, presumably to power the doctor's instruments. The stalactites and stalagmites gave the passage the appearance of a mouth inviting us to be eaten alive. We called in the tunnel and determined to leave two guys there to establish a marshaling point. They would also need to act as a radio relay, slash fight the fire that was growing by the second.‚Äù


‚ÄúInto the belly of the beast we went. Two more bangs down the hall, a run-walk through the corridor, and we were in the Doctor‚Äôs lair. I was the first one through the breach. I dug in the left corner and yelled out, 'Police!' ‚ÄòHands on your face.‚Äô disrespecting my surroundings.‚Äù


‚ÄúI established my point of domination and swept my sector, taking in the rest of the room. The place looked like an E.R. for the damned, made worse by the light of the fire that still raged in the other room. Corpses were strapped to the beds lining the walls of the cave. A few partitions were still up, providing deep concealment; those were tricky to clear. The medical equipment stalactites and stalagmites cast hellish figures around the room, causing me and my team to burn out the shadows with our NGALs. Still, demons danced in my periphery. The smell was potent in there. My skin began itching, and I wondered if we triggered the chemical agent when we opened the false cabinet door. Not carrying a gas mask was a mistake. What I had was a SOTR If you, OSS types, are unfamiliar, it's like the masks you wear when installing insulation on a house. Anyway, the team all had the same realization I did and began donning whatever CBRN protection they had as quickly and silently as possible. Someone withdrew back to our marshaling point for lack of protection. I recall no longer feeling fatigued, and it felt like time was moving a bit more slowly. I sound-whored through my Peltors paying close attention to the eerie silence. The room was maybe 20 by 30 yards with a slight declination running to another passage on the far side of the room. Waving my gun to indicate I was ready to move, we started working our way down the room, being careful to check behind every ounce of deadspace. I could see through my thermal overlay that many of the corpses still had heat signatures, despite appearing to be long dead. Noting that they were shackled to their beds, I called in TEMS and proceeded to clear the room. The ones I was able to get a close glimpse of looked emaciated. They had rotting wounds where flesh had been stripped away and busted capillaries over their skin. As we made our way down, I had to clear one of the partitions. In it was an empty bed with dual stirrups suspended for holding up the occupants' legs. There was also a large humidifier running, so I switched it off and began to exit. I reported the possibility of a child being present over the radio and reestablished my position in the stack. That‚Äôs when I heard the creak of a bed behind me. The corpses were writhing. Metal started to bend, pulled by the restraints.‚Äù


‚ÄúI heard a snap, looked to the other side of the room. One of the victims broke her restraints. Someone to my left called out, ‚ÄúPolice, hands on your face.‚Äù The rising body wasn‚Äôt complying. More snaps answered. What I had once assumed to be the dead began to rise. I don't know, maybe they were still dead.‚Äù 


‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Richard asked. 


‚ÄúThe state they were in.. None of them should still be alive, let alone strong enough to break restraints.‚Äù Ben exclaimed.


Dick wrote something down, likely ‚Äòthis guy's nuts,‚Äô and showed it to Richard. 


Dick turned to Ben, ‚ÄúConvenient, isn‚Äôt it? First, you say the bodies were dead, then they weren‚Äôt. Which one is it? Or did you just panic and start shooting?‚Äù


Richard rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúTake your time. If they moved, if they‚Ä¶ changed, we need to know exactly how.‚Äù


Ben reorganized his thoughts, cleared his throat, and continued with the truth. ‚ÄúThey were all about us. I heard a muffled scream behind me. Trusting my team to handle it, I kept my focus on the two before me, a male and a female. The man was silhouetted, but the woman was haunting. She was once beautiful, but her eyes were soulless. Their moves were disjointed. I gave commands, but they seemed unresponsive. When they made their move, it was inhumanly fast. I muzzle-thumped the woman, knocking her into the man. She grabbed a scalpel that was on the ground. The man had a hammer. I yelled commands again, but they ignored me. I performed a box drill on the two. Hammered doubles into one transitioned to the other, and placed a round in the nose of each. That never happens outside of training.‚Äù


‚ÄúThe staccato of gunfire was over almost as fast as it started. It was a minor miracle that up to that point, no one had been grievously injured. Unfortunately, that didn‚Äôt remain the case. That's when I heard a feminine voice in a rasp plead, ‚ÄúTurn. On. The. Gas.‚Äù She shouldn‚Äôt have been able to speak at all. She was one of the individuals who received some extra ventilation. I tried to render aid, but by the time I got there, she had expired. I said a short, silent prayer, cinched the zip cuffs on every person not in uniform, and took my position back in formation. We were again ready to press further.‚Äù


‚ÄúI thought you said the Doctor lobbed off body parts?‚Äù Richard said. 


‚ÄúI did‚Äù 


The men in black let the implication hang in the air unanswered.


‚ÄúThe rest of the cave wasn‚Äôt as straightforward; we entered the short chamber, which had a makeshift built-in closet and two tunnels. One led North, the other West. We had to split the team. We left three more guys to cover each entrance of the room and act as relays. I took the remaining three members of Team One with me, and Team Two had four. I took my guys down the north tunnel. The further we went, the more we relied on our NGALs to provide light, eventually switching on IR helmet Lights to prevent tripping and misidentification. Along the wall, we came across some old cave drawings, but they weren‚Äôt made by the people these were helenistic. I have no idea how someone could‚Äôve been brave enough to come down this far with what passed for a light source before flashlights. Just as that thought crossed my mind, we got the call from Erickson on the second team. They‚Äôd found where the doc was keeping the remains of his earlier victims. Shortly thereafter, we arrived at what I think the doctor would call his Surgery, complete with a steel table, lights, electrical outlets, and instruments. It looked more to me like the back room of a butcher's shop. There was a puddle of blood on the floor, but no body. This room was yet another fork in the road.‚Äù


‚ÄúWe noticed some infrared light coming from another westerly tunnel. Radioing team two, we hit the last bit of good luck we‚Äôd have for the night. After identifying the light source as friendly, we all linked up and prepared to enter the next segment of the cave. By this time, we were all soaked. I can‚Äôt explain it, but those tunnels were scorching. It must‚Äôve been 98 degrees down there, given that the thermal overlays were registering the cave as hot. We entered the next tunnel, leaving another two-man team. This one stretched into three small chambers, all with smashed rock formations ending in a pair of double doors surrounded by triangle markings. By this time, we had lost the initiative, and I could hear voices on the other side. We placed a door charge and pulled back into the second chamber.‚Äù


Richards' ears perked up. ‚ÄúWhat did the voices sound like?‚Äù


Ben rubbed his face, ‚ÄúThey all sounded like they had throat cancer.‚Äù


Richard raised his eyebrows, ‚ÄúWere they speaking English?‚Äù 


‚ÄúDefinitely not, it could‚Äôve been Arabic, but I couldn't make it out. Ben said, now rubbing his eyes. Ben was dreading this next bit.‚Äù


Richard finished his notes and gestured to Ben.


‚ÄúWhen the door blew, it splintered into a thousand pieces. We launched bangs deep into the room, pouring in behind them. It was the largest we‚Äôd been in thus far. I was surprised when I didn‚Äôt hear the usual groans of people exposed to overwhelming waves of pressure and sound. The room sported an upright, cyberpunk-style metal coffin. Ya know, your stereotypical super soldier machine. The Doctor drew a star inside a circle on the floor around the coffin, but I didn‚Äôt get a good look at the design. Beyond that was a knocked-over camera, a boat, and an underground lake. I was last in the stack behind Erickson, sweeping my sector, when I noticed Erickson frozen way out of position, far from where he should have been. He was in no man‚Äôs land. Staring up at the entry we had just come through. With his rifle raised and NGAL activated, it looked like a lightsaber. Following his laser, I saw what he was aiming at. At first, I thought it was a rock formation. As I looked, I realized it had a face. Bullets exploded from Erickson's gun. The thing with too long limbs fell on top of me. It charged Erickson, took him to the other side of the cave and into the lake.‚Äù


Dick shifted his weight. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean the limbs were too long?‚Äù

Ben‚Äôs jaw tightened. ‚ÄúI mean what I said, full height ‚Äîeight feet.‚Äù

The lights buzzed a little louder.

Dick clicked his pen, ‚ÄúSo let me get this straight. You‚Äôre saying a giant tackled one of your operators into an underground lake? Do you hear how insane that sounds?‚Äù

Ben felt the clock‚Äôs ticking speed up. ‚ÄúI know how crazy I sound, but God forbid those things made it out of the cave.‚Äù

Dick let his mask slip; he blanched and recovered, but it was just long enough for Ben to realize these guys believed him. 

Richard gestured Ben closer, ‚ÄúWhat you saw, it‚Äôs not the first time we‚Äôve had this kind of talk.‚Äù He lowered his voice. ‚ÄúOff the record‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not crazy.‚Äù

The room felt a little less oppressive.


Ben took a sip of the inky cup of coffee sitting in front of him, allowing the burnt liquid, now cold too, beat off the darkness a little longer. The fog in his head was lifting, and his mind hardened, or maybe his heart. Some metamorphosis had occurred below the professor's house, but now was not the time to contemplate how the doctor's experiments had affected him. He stilled the shaky cup of coffee, set it on the table, and continued.


‚ÄúI stood up, with little traces of foreign blood on my cracked plate carrier, ATAK busted, but I had to locate Erickson. We cleared what we could of the cavern, wearily watching the water and walls of the cave for movement. That‚Äôs when we heard a splash from the other side of the cave. It was Erickson, helmet strobe flashing. I was relieved when he called out to us and said he killed it, but he was hurting. Said he wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it to our side of the cave. I couldn‚Äôt make him out under thermal, but I thought that was just the cave masking his signature. I shone my light at him, but it wouldn‚Äôt penetrate the smoke and fog. I didn‚Äôt trust the space; more people should have been in there. I ordered a quick and dirty SSE on the room, hoping to find some keys to the boat that would help us retrieve Erickson. Perhaps we could get another clue as to what hell we were dealing with. The Relay network wasn't working. I started back for reception to call the cavalry when the room came down.‚Äù



Chapter 2: Feed My Frankenstein

‚ÄúYou have taken from me my loved ones and friends ‚Äî darkness is my closest companion.‚Äù -Psalm 88:18


‚ÄúI awoke in darkness. My helmet was still on my head, but it was uncomfortable. Feeling around, I still had my SOTR though I couldn‚Äôt seal and I was missing my PVS-31‚Äôs. I discovered my helmet was caved in on the left side by debris from the explosion. Both my helmet light and left Peltor sheared off, but my Princeton Tec reading light was still functioning. I clicked it on, bathing the room in a red light. I was alone. I couldn‚Äôt see my rifle, so I drew my sidearm, a Staccato XC with a PB-3 Optic and a Surefire X300. I did a function check. The pistol grip was covered in dust, but otherwise, it appeared unharmed. The dot was clear, and the X300 worked. I surveyed the room with the bright light and found my rifle. Sitting up, I could see that the cave had bent my Geissele Super Duty at a ten-degree angle, and its optics were busted. I tried my radio, but the explosion smashed it. I went to stand in some pain. Though it felt like a break, the Docs told me it was a bad sprain.‚Äù


Dick made another note, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you do next?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Superman; I wasn‚Äôt getting through the cave-in on my own.‚Äù


‚ÄúI stumbled my way to get help. The red light gave my team's bloody footsteps a black color. Blood dripped on my face from the ceiling. Peering up with my whiplashed neck was a chore; there above me were long bloody handprints and claw marks on the roof of the cave. That‚Äôs when it dawned on me why the radio relays weren‚Äôt working. I called out blue, but there was no reply. When I hobbled into the surgery, I tripped, barely catching myself before I hit the floor. Picking myself up, the puddle of blood looked more like a pond. It felt like I had kicked a kettlebell. Looking back in the red light, I saw a blood-soaked helmet with night vision attached. The only sign I had that the relay team had ever been in the surgery was a helmet with Reese‚Äôs head still inside.‚Äù


‚ÄúI prayed for Reese and the rest of our team as I held my breath. After trading helmets, I could see again. I feel like we walked into a trap. I recall thinking that what hurt Erickson might not have been the only surprise the good doctor had in store for us. The thing could see in the dark, so I turned off the IR strobe and resigned myself to using any light source sparingly. I had to even the playing fields.‚Äù


‚ÄúWhen Team Two found what I‚Äôve now determined to be their pantry, they did not say anything about the victims being hung upside down. Like any stockpile, the freshest supplies were in the back.‚Äù


Dicks pencil stopped; he erased what he‚Äôd written. 

‚ÄúJust to clarify, they‚Äôre cannibals.‚Äù

Ben deadpanned, ‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre human‚Äù.

Dick continued writing, but Ben knew Dick just had a pen.

Ben rubbed his eyes and pressed on.


‚ÄúWorking my way through the bodies, I found six of my teammates. Three were bled out by their throats, one missing a head, one flayed, and one alive, barely. I wasn‚Äôt sure how to get David down without doing permanent damage. I checked him for major bleeding. The thing hung him from his hip and fortunately missed the femoral. The cut on his neck was superficial, bleeding a lot, but didn‚Äôt puncture the jugular. Patched what I could to stem the bleeding, and I felt good about his chances of survival. Using the Reese‚Äôs multicolor reading light, I checked his remaining eye for responsiveness, and it came back good. I patched up his eye and applied a pressure bandage. His airway was unobstructed except for his gas mask, and his breathing was labored but consistent. I felt as comfortable as I could about leaving my friend. Of the guns on the floor, I chose the shotgun. It was Reese‚Äôs Genesis Gen-12 PDS 5‚Äù equipped with a suppressor, EOtech, NGAL, and Modlight. I stripped the plate carrier off of Reese‚Äôs headless corpse. I didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd mind. Had he not been caught off guard, he would‚Äôve been the best of all of us to fight these things.‚Äù


‚ÄúI called the TOC over Reese‚Äôs Radio, but still got no response.‚Äù


‚ÄúI did my fastest hobble through the tunnels, clearing the short room and closet, throwing some light down the first tunnel. Center-checking the E.R., I dumped into the room, careful not to wake the dead. The fire roared, casting eerie silhouettes. The humidifier was producing more gas. I caught movement on the ceiling. On instinct, I activated my light and poured buckshot into the area, catching a creature mid-pounce. The head turned into hamburger, and too long arms separated from the torso. I fell sideways into a partition, narrowly dodging gore. When it crashed, all that remained attached to the main body were the lower limbs. I stood, killed the gas, and examined the creature with my flashlight. Its body was hairless and humanoid, but that‚Äôs where its humanity ended. Its blood bubbled with a pinkish color, like it was more oxygen-rich. In case this thing could regenerate like something from a horror film, I lobbed off the legs and divided the torso into two sections with a cordless surgical equivalent to an electric chainsaw. In the end it was just flesh and bone.‚Äù


Dick flipped through notes.

‚ÄúBen‚Ä¶ did it scratch you, bite you‚Äîanything that broke skin?‚Äù

Ben shook his head but was unsure.

Richard spoke to Dick but never took his eyes off Ben.

‚ÄúWe already talked to the paramedics; any cuts he had came from the cave.‚Äù

Dick didn‚Äôt hide his annoyance. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still giving him a once-over and running tests. We don‚Äôt know what that gas is.‚Äù

Richard looked at the clock.

‚ÄúDick, cool it‚Ä¶ Tell us what happened next, Ben.‚Äù


‚ÄúWhen I reached the basement. I had to flip up my NODs The fire had consumed the stairs and caught the house above. The basement was coated in the gory remains of my fallen teammates. They had a damn barbecue. There was no way out. I tried my radio again, and this time I got a response. I contacted the officers outside and relayed the situation to the best of my ability. Before you ask, no, I didn‚Äôt say we were fighting abominations down here. The officers were working with the firefighters to subdue the fire, but it would be a while before any help arrived. I did what I could to control the fire on my end with the extinguishers my teammates found, but it was like pissing on a volcano.‚Äù


Ben shifted uncomfortably in his chair, feeling the room close in. He couldn‚Äôt wait to get away from these assholes.


‚ÄúAbove the roar, I heard Erickson‚Äôs voice call out to me. I turned to the black hole that led back into the cave. I heard it again. He was calling for help. He needed my help to get our teammates out. I called back, telling him I needed another hand. ‚ÄòDavid‚Äôs in here, and he lost a lot of blood.‚Äô There was a long pause before I heard a reply. ‚ÄòDavid‚Äôs dead Ben‚Äô Same rhythm. Same hitch. Not Erickson. Not Erickson rolled Reese‚Äôs head down the tunnel, coming to a stop with a wet sound. He looked up at me and spoke. ‚ÄòBut they can bring us back, you can bring us all back.‚Äô Not Erikson started to say something else when I activated my weapon light, blinding the monster. It was leaning in, salivating at me from the top right corner of the tunnel. It began reacting when the shotgun coughed. It‚Äôs bald, pale face with greedy gold eyes, and inhuman jaw, evaporated.‚Äù


‚ÄúIts headless body hit the floor.‚Äù


The agents seemed unfazed, even though over the span of minutes, Ben claimed that the head of his dead friend spoke to him and that he‚Äôd killed two of Frankenstein's monsters. 


‚ÄúBen, before we run through this again, you need to know you were the only member of your unit who survived that raid,‚Äù Dick said with what passed for condolence.

Ben was incredulous. 

‚ÄúWhat happened to David?‚Äù

Dick was visibly uncomfortable.

‚ÄúHe was retrieved from the cave but a complication occurred mid-surgery.  An uncontrollable brain bleed, there was nothing more the doctors could do.‚Äù

Ben was flabbergasted. He thought David was going to make it.

‚ÄúAre you cutting off the recovery team?‚Äù

Richard who was on his phone looked up and straightened himself.

‚ÄúThings are moving fast. The higher ups just pulled the SAR team and sealed the passage for good.‚Äù

Ben looked at one agent, then the other. ‚ÄúWhat, why?‚Äù

A tablet appeared in Richard‚Äôs hands from thin air and slid across the table with a shove.

‚ÄúBecause of this.‚Äù


This shouldn‚Äôt exist, Ben thought, not only the tablet but the image on the screen. He thought the camera was broken in the blast. Ben understood what he was looking at. Erickson‚Äôs strobe lit a far wall of the cavern. Two dozen sets of eyes reflected back at the camera. Perfectly round. Perfectly predatory.


Dick didn‚Äôt even look.

‚ÄúInfrared bloom. Happens all the time when equipment‚Äôs compromised in heat.‚Äù

Richard snapped his head toward him.

‚ÄúBloom? Are you kidding me? Those are monsters. Living, breathing, looking straight at us.‚Äù

Ben studied them both. For the first time, Dick wasn‚Äôt sneering‚Äîhe was pale. Sweating.

Dick leaned forward, voice cold and precise.

‚ÄúWe are not in the business of confirming fairy tales. Officially, your team was lost in a structural collapse. Unofficially‚Äî‚Äù he cut a glance at Ben, razor sharp, ‚Äú‚Äîyou‚Äôre alive because you kept moving. That‚Äôs the story. Nothing else leaves this room.‚Äù

Richard ignored him. ‚ÄúNothing off the table, Ben. How would you kill them?‚Äù

Dick slammed his palm flat on the table.

‚ÄúEnough, Rich! Another word, and you go in the shredder with the rest of this story.‚Äù


The light buzzed, then stuttered. Ben drained the cold coffee and set the cup down. One man believed him. The other wanted him buried with his men. Ben thought of the families of those men and decided which version of the truth he could live with.

1nwbyz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/zoloft/comments/1nwbyz0/m_in_20s_first_time_on_meds_instant_effect_of/,"[M in 20s] First time on meds, Instant effect of zoloft in less than a week?","I went to see psychiatrist because I was depressed. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and prescribed 50mg zoloft together with 5mg olanzapine. I was also told to bump zoloft to 100mg after first week.

I have come to conclusion that when pill enters the bloodstream and circulates enough something starts happening, good stuff starts much quicker than for other people.

First 2 days I was sleepy due to olanzapine.

But day 3 was interesting, I was out in caffe restaurant with friend's and I was feeling depressed, looking down and quiet. I somehow got into conversation and suddenly I felt some kind of rush thru my skin, feet started itching, i had huugeee urge to stand up and start running, my speech started stuttering and it got faster. That lasted for maybe 15 minutes and that ""internal"" feeling went away. All that happened around 2PM.

Day 4, I woke up, ate one banana and took 50mg of zoloft. Classic usual morning, doc visit for lab tests and I went to see a friend. At around 1PM, i got same ""internal"" feeling while waiting for bus, sudden change. I have started walking back and forth for like 10mins constantly while looking on my phone and I unconsciously decided to get into wrong bus, realized it and exited on next stop. What is weird is that whenever I get that feeling, most of my worries go away, my mind is racing with thoughts but I have no exact thought to catch on.

Day 5, this is biggest change, I woke up, 2 hours after taking the 50mg dose, I randomly started dancing with music and recording myself for a friend. (I'm not that kind of person but I enjoyed doing that, and I still don't know why I did that, I just wanted to do it in that moment, now I feel ashamed of that). I spent 20mins enjoying the music and then something happened. I couldn't sit still, I had to move back and forth again but this time around the house, walking pace started increasing and I called a friend just to chat with him at same time. Then suddenly walking pace increased even more and I started reaching out behind my back with my hands trying to catch something, feeling like something is following me or is behind me. That resulted into getting out of the hosue and talking on the phone and walking outside. I hit my step count goal for the day in 2 hours without getting out of my yard.

Day 6, I was just happy all day, I decided to replace some stuff in bathroom that I was constantly putting away, what's weird, I was happy doing it, even though nothing was going as planned. I replaced bathroom sink and cleaned whole bathroom in the end. I was productive, energetic and happy.

Day 7, 100mg zoloft dose, usual morning but much happier. Got myself some coffee and started to work on my PC. Due to the job circumstances, I had to wait for something to complete and I decided to do the dishes. I have done the dishes with music literally dancing while doing them. Suddenly I had that amazing feeling of happiness,  feeling like whole life is going great, that I can do and achieve anything if I'm given enough time. That resulted into me going out and taking 4km run. (I was lazy to do that even before I hit deepest part od my depression). And generally that day I was really productive and happy.

Now end of day 7, my eyes are getting tired, I want to go to sleep soon, but I completely lost that energetic feeling. I still get bad feelings and emotions sometimes during the day but my mood has chnaged.

TLDR: I had bad, really bad depression. Went to the psychiatrist and got prescribed zoloft 50mg + olanzapine 5mg. First 2 days i felt no change, only side effects, day 3 i had weird good feelings, day 4/5 my mood was opposite of depression, day 6/7 everything had a menaing, i was full of energy to do everything. 

So the question is, is this normal? Is this how fast you're supposed to get out of major depression?

I used to feel like this before, but I never had these unbelievable urges to do stuff instantly. ",1,1759430086.0,zoloft,1,1.0,False

I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôve had this *itch* lately‚Ä¶ the one that makes you question why you‚Äôre stuck in a cubicle when you could be working from the beach or that cozy little coffee shop down the street. I mean, who wants to be tied down to a 9-to-5 grind when beginner creators are out there literally *raking it in* with some super cool AI tools? 

Think about it: **what if you could work smarter, not harder?** Sounds dreamy, right? Well, the dream is waking up all around us! Here‚Äôs how.

### Why You Should Ditch the 9-to-5 Vibes:

- **Flexibility**: Say goodbye to that dreadful morning alarm. You get to choose what hours work for you and your creative flow!
- **Unlimited Income Potential**: No cap on how much you can earn. You‚Äôre not bound to someone else's paycheck limits. ü§ë
- **Endless Creativity**: Finding ways to express yourself without the constraints of a boss or a strict framework can be... *liberating*.

### Here‚Äôs the Deal: Untapped AI Tools to Check Out

I‚Äôm talking about tools that can skyrocket your productivity and help you monetize your passions like never before. Check these out:

1. **Content Generators** ‚Äì Ever feel stuck with writer‚Äôs block? Try an AI content generator to help kickstart your thoughts. Seriously, it‚Äôs like having a brainstorming buddy who‚Äôs always there!
   
2. **Graphic Design Wizards** ‚Äì Platforms are popping up that can create stunning graphics with just a few clicks. No design degree required! Your social media posts are about to look *next level*.

3. **SEO Tools** ‚Äì Make Uncle Google your friend! AI tools can help optimize your content so that it meets all those pesky SEO guidelines. More visibility = more traffic = more chances to make money! 

4. **AI Encrypted Links** ‚Äì Like the one I‚Äôm sharing here: [Easy Peasy AI](https://easy-peasy.ai/?via=aca). It‚Äôs a fabulously user-friendly platform for anyone looking to harness the power of AI in their projects. (P.S. This is an affiliate link, so I might get a little something if you check it out! üòÑ)

### Some Success Stories üí°

- **The ‚ÄúMompreneur‚Äù**: A friend of mine started a blog about parenting tips. With an AI tool, she automagically generated content, promoted it through social media, and is now earning more than her day job. 
- **The Creative Gamer**: Another dude I know creates video game commentaries. By using AI-assisted editing software, he‚Äôs cranking out content and making a killing through ad revenue.

### A Little Humor to Brighten Your Day

Ever try to explain your dreams to someone still grinding that 9-to-5? It‚Äôs like telling a cat to fetch! You get a lot of confused looks and maybe a head tilt. üê± But hey, you keep grinding ‚Äî we‚Äôre just over here hustling in our PJs! 

So, yeah, if you're sitting there contemplating making that leap, now might just be the perfect time. So many beginner creators are capitalizing on these AI tools and thriving! What if you could be next? 

Let‚Äôs keep the conversation going! Who's already using some AI tools? What‚Äôs been your experience? What would you do with your newfound freedom and profitability?",1,1759430028.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

I work at a large company, to get to the office there is a company bus that drives us to the building. 

Around 6 weeks ago I noticed this weird guy in the public transport looking at me, to my surprise he got onto my company bus and kept looking at me. Ever since I‚Äôve realised he‚Äôs always trying to sit close to me, he always tries to spot me first thing when he gets on the bus, he‚Äôs often staring. Once when the bus was almost full he took the chance to sit next to me of all other people. It‚Äôs all so subtle that I have a hard time putting it into words but he creeps me out, I‚Äôve never been in such a situation before so I really think somethings off with him.

At work I‚Äôve only ever seen him once when he was having lunch by himself, which is extremely strange since normally everyone eats with their team. This week he also happened to magically appear at my coffee break. 

I‚Äôm afraid of things escalating. I have pointed it out to two colleagues who also take the same transport.

I‚Äôm not sure if I should avoid all eye contact or if I should confront him, or anything in between. I‚Äôm not sure at which point one reaches out to HR. I just know I feel extremely anxious about this situation. ",2,1759429954.0,TwoXChromosomes,4,1.0,False

- Joycat Alphabet Mystery Box for Kids. My son will grab pieces out of the box and match a few. He goes through the whole alphabet, practices his letter sounds without even realizing it, and then asks to play again with Dad when he gets home. Sometimes we use the box itself for a ‚Äúfeel and guess‚Äù game, which has basically turned into a little family activity for us.


- Magna-Tiles. A classic. He builds little houses or just stacks random ‚Äúcastles,‚Äù and sometimes we‚Äôll play together making ‚Äúgarages‚Äù for his toy cars. They‚Äôre pricey, but we use them every single day, and they‚Äôll definitely grow with him.


- Duplo Lego sets. He‚Äôs not quite ready for regular Legos yet, but Duplos are the perfect size. He mostly builds towers, then knocks them down with dramatic sound effects üòÇ I like that they‚Äôre sturdy and don‚Äôt scatter everywhere like smaller blocks.


- Melissa & Doug Wooden Puzzles.These get pulled out a couple times a week. He‚Äôs obsessed with the animal one (the farm animals have little pegs). It‚Äôs great for his focus, and it gives me 10‚Äì15 minutes to sip coffee while he works at it.


- Montessori-style Busy Board. We keep one in the car for longer rides. It has buckles, laces, zippers, etc., and basically all the little fidget things toddlers can‚Äôt resist. It‚Äôs been a lifesaver during errands and road trips.

1nwblh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_chemex4coffee/comments/1nwblh7/the_origin_of_the_word_coffee_is_qahwa_in_arabic/,The origin of the word coffee is qahwa in Arabic,"Beginning in the Arabian Peninsula

The word ""coffee"" is of pure Arabic origin (qahwa). It was initially used to denote a drink that energizes the body and quenches appetite. As coffee spread from Yemen to Mecca and then to the rest of the Islamic world, the name ""coffee"" became associated with the new beverage extracted from roasted coffee beans. From here, its linguistic and cultural journey began.



Coffee in Ottoman: Kahve

When coffee reached the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century, the Turks adopted it and it became an essential part of their social and political culture. In Turkish, the Arabic word ""coffee"" was transformed into ""kahve.""



From Istanbul, this drink spread to the sultan's court and popular gatherings alike, until it became a symbol of Ottoman hospitality.



Coffee in Italy: Caff√®

From Ottoman ports, especially Venice, which was a bridge between East and West, coffee reached Italy. There, the Turkish word ""kahve"" took its Italian form, ""caff√®.""



Italy played a pivotal role in developing brewing methods, such as espresso and cappuccino, which made the word ""caff√®"" synonymous with vibrant coffee shops, which remain an integral part of Italian identity to this day.



Coffee in English:

With the flourishing of European trade in the 17th and 18th centuries, coffee reached Britain, the Netherlands, and France. From the Italian caff√®, the word evolved into the French caf√©, and then entered English in its current form, coffee.



Coffee shops proliferated in London, Paris, and Amsterdam, becoming centers of culture, politics, and thought, earning them the nickname ""schools of the 18th century.""



Journey Summary:

Arabic: qahwa

Turkish: kahve

Italian: caff√®

English: coffee



Thus, it can be said that the word ""coffee"" is not just the name of a beverage; it is a linguistic and cultural bridge that has traveled across centuries, carried on ships and caravans from Yemen to the Ottomans, and from there to Europe, and then to every home in the world.

I‚Äôm a graduate student at USC working on a research project about SoulCycle. We‚Äôre looking to interview riders about their experiences in class.

* The interview would take about 30‚Äì45 minutes (phone call or Zoom conversation).
* I would be happy to pay for a coffee or send a gift card for your time!
* It‚Äôs super casual ‚Äî just sharing your thoughts and stories about SoulCycle.
* Your insights will help us better understand the rider experience.

If you‚Äôve been to SoulCycle and are open to chatting, feel free to comment here and I can reach out or message me directly! We‚Äôd really appreciate your help! üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíõ

Thank you so much in advance!",1,1759428847.0,SoulCycle_Riders,3,0.67,False
