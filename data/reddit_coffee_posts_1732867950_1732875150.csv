1h2idyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1h2idyc/ikawa_home_questions_timing_and_temp_first_crack/,Ikawa Home Questions - Timing and Temp @ First Crack,"Hey all, 

After reading Scott Rao's book I've taken the leap and started playing around with the profile editor on my Ikawa Home and was hoping to get a bit of guidance. 

The beans I've got kept tipping and scorching so I've increased the airflow and slowed the ramp up and max temperature and getting much better results. 

1. Currently I'm hitting first crack at 5:20 and the inlet temp is 246c, I don't know if anyone has any experience with Ikawa but do these timing and temps seem in the rough ballpark of acceptable?
2. The beans are coming out fairly dark, if I want a lighter roast for more acidity would it be a case of trying to fit first crack sooner, reducing the development time or a bit of both?
3. In Scott's book he mentions that the best coffee's he's tasted all tend to be between 20-25% development time, if I wanted to keep the beans lighter would you start decreasing temp after first crack?
4. If I wanted more body would this be an extended maillard phase pre first crack so longer time with bean temp between 150-190c?

Sorry for all the questions and understand if it's asking too much :D I'll have a play around anyway and report back my findings!",1,1732873676.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

I just wanted to vent a bit somewhere and get this down so thanks for reading.  
  
I had a very sleepless night last night and this morning I woke up from a dream where I was screaming at my father telling him how I really feel. He was sat in a seat in the house where my stepmother and my younger sisters live now, a house that he never ended up living in because their marriage totally fell apart just before they were all set to move in.  It was awkward and we were making small talk and he made sarcastic comment as he often did saying 'It's nice we can actually have a conversation' at which point I flipped and said ""Conversation? What conversation? You think this is a conversation? Making small talk? I can't have a real conversation with you, you don't hear anything, you don't want to hear anything. You think this is what I wanted? You think I didn't want a relationship with you? That's all I've ever wanted but you've made it impossible. You think I wanted things to be this way?"" and in the dream I began to sob at this point. Then I woke up, a lot earlier than usual. My wife was still asleep so I went and had a shower, got a coffee and tried to start my day a bit and brush it off. I dropped my wife off at work and when I got home I just broke down in tears and here I am writing this.

It wasn't always bad and today I find myself thinking about the good things when I was much younger and how this is not how I wanted our relationship to go. There was a point in time where he was a loving father. He could be goofy and make us laugh. I still remember the laughs we had, winding each other up, the family game nights and holidays, the smell of his Armani aftershave when he'd hug me. This was before his bipolar/drinking/gambling  got the better of him and he started on a path of self-destruction to totally destroy all of his relationships, with his closest family in particular. 

When you think of the good things, it makes you really fucking sad and I am struggling a bit today. I sometimes think about reaching out because I still long for that father/son relationship but I know in my heart of hearts that it's just not possible. The only way I could have a 'relationship' with him would be to totally pander to him and his behaviour, and let him drink himself into a stupor and treat everybody around him like shit, and I just don't have it in me to excuse that and I also just don't fucking deserve that - nobody does.",1,1732872815.0,EstrangedAdultChild,0,1.0,False

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

Picture this: me, on my hands and knees, battling weeds in my garden. My back aches, my knees protest, and I'm sweating bullets. Then, I discovered the ergonomic weeder. It was a game-changer. Let me share my journey, from gardening grunt to ergonomic evangelist.
  
  
## The Struggle is Real: My Life Before the Ergonomic Weeder

Gardening used to feel like a wrestling match with Mother Nature, and let me tell you, I was losing! Picture me, hunched over like a pretzel, trying to yank out weeds with a traditional hand tool. My back would scream louder than my neighbor’s lawnmower at 7 a.m. I swear, I could hear my spine groaning, “Help me!” as I bent down for the umpteenth time. 

After a long session in the garden, I’d shuffle back inside, feeling like I’d just completed an Olympic event. My knees? Throbbing. My wrists? A bit cranky, like they’d just been through a boxing match. And let’s not even talk about the blisters that formed on my palms. I’d sit down with an ice pack, wondering if I’d accidentally signed up for a gardening torture camp instead of a relaxing hobby. 

The worst part? I’d wake up the next day feeling like I’d gone ten rounds with a heavyweight champion. Simple tasks like getting out of bed or bending down to tie my shoes turned into mini adventures. I’d think, “Is this really worth it?” But I loved gardening so much that I kept pushing through the pain, hoping one day I’d find a better way. Spoiler alert: I did!

## Ergonomic Weeder: The Game Changer

The ergonomic weeder is like the superhero of gardening tools, swooping in to save us from the backaches and sore knees that come with pulling pesky weeds. Imagine a tool that’s designed not just to get the job done, but to do it while keeping your body happy. That’s what this weeder is all about. It has a long handle that lets you stand tall while you work, reducing the need to bend over like a pretzel. The head of the weeder is shaped just right, allowing you to easily dig into the soil and yank out those stubborn weeds without breaking a sweat.

The first time I used it, I felt like I was wielding Excalibur. Seriously! I remember standing in my garden, the sun shining down, and I thought, “This is going to be a game changer.” As I plunged the weeder into the ground, it felt smooth and effortless. I pulled out a weed that had been taunting me for weeks. The immediate benefits were astonishing—no more aching back, no more sore knees, just pure gardening bliss. It’s funny how a simple tool can turn a chore into a pleasure. I even started to enjoy weeding, which is saying a lot! Who knew that a little ergonomic magic could make such a difference?

## The Science Behind the Swoon: Why Ergonomics Matter

Have you ever tried to pull weeds while feeling like a pretzel? You know, all bent over, knees creaking, and back screaming for mercy? That’s where ergonomics comes in, and trust me, it’s a game changer. In simple terms, ergonomics is all about designing tools and spaces so that we can work comfortably and efficiently. It’s like giving a high-five to your body while you tackle that garden!

Now, let’s talk about the ergonomic weeder. This nifty tool is designed with your body’s natural movements in mind. Picture this: instead of bending down, you can stand tall, with a comfortable grip that doesn’t make your hands feel like they’re fighting a boxing match. The handle is often at an angle, allowing you to dig into the soil without twisting your back like a pretzel. It’s like the tool is saying, “Hey, I got your back!”

Studies show that using ergonomic tools can reduce strain and fatigue. A research article from the Journal of Occupational Health found that ergonomic designs can lower the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. Experts say that when tools fit our bodies, we can work longer and feel better doing it. So, if you want to garden without turning into a human origami, ergonomic tools are definitely the way to go!

## Weeding Made Easy: Step-by-Step with My New Best Friend

Weeding can feel like a never-ending battle, but with my ergonomic weeder, it’s more like a dance—one that doesn’t leave my back screaming for mercy. Here’s how to use this nifty tool effectively, step by step.

* **Grip It Right**: Start by holding the ergonomic weeder with both hands. The handle is designed to fit comfortably, so don’t be shy! Get a good grip.
* **Positioning**: Stand tall and keep your feet shoulder-width apart. This helps you maintain balance and stability. No wobbly knees here!
* **Find the Target**: Spot those pesky weeds. Look for the ones that are taking over your precious plants. They’re usually the ones that look like they had too much coffee—wild and unruly.
* **Insert the Weeder**: Slide the forked end of the weeder into the soil beside the weed. Aim to get it as deep as possible without disturbing your plants. Think of it as giving the weed a gentle hug—just not too tight!
* **Twist and Pull**: Give the handle a little twist while pulling up. This action loosens the roots. It’s like coaxing a stubborn friend out of their chair!
* **Remove and Dispose**: Once the weed is out, toss it into your compost or yard waste bag. No need to let it party in your garden.
* **Repeat**: Keep going! You’ll get into a rhythm, and before you know it, your garden will look like a magazine cover.

Remember, it’s not just about getting the weeds out; it’s about enjoying the process. Take breaks, sip some lemonade, and admire your handiwork. Happy weeding!

## The Long-Term Effects: A Back in Motion

Switching to an ergonomic weeder has been nothing short of a revelation for my gardening life. Seriously, if I could hug that tool, I would. Since I made the switch, my back has thanked me in ways I never thought possible. I used to feel like a pretzel after a long day in the garden, but now? I’m standing tall, like a proud sunflower basking in the sun.

One of the most noticeable changes has been my posture. I used to hunch over like a question mark, but now I’m more of an exclamation point! I can feel my spine aligning better, and I’ve even caught my reflection in the window and thought, “Hey there, straight back!” It’s amazing how something as simple as the right tool can change how you carry yourself. 

Read more: <https://tedsadvice.com/ergonomic-weeder> 

My flexibility has improved too. I can bend, twist, and reach without feeling like I’m auditioning for a role in a contortionist show. Gardening has become more enjoyable, almost like a dance rather than a chore. I find myself spending more time outside, not just because I have less pain, but because I’m genuinely having fun. 

Plus, I’ve noticed a boost in my gardening efficiency. I can tackle those pesky weeds faster, and with less strain, leaving me more time to enjoy the fruits of my labor—both literally and figuratively. Who knew that a little ergonomic magic could lead to such a big change?

## You've Got to Spend Money to Save Money: The Cost Factor

When it comes to gardening tools, the ergonomic weeder is like the superhero in a world of garden gadgets. But let’s talk about the elephant in the room: the cost. Now, I won’t lie. These tools can be a bit pricey. You might find yourself staring at the price tag, thinking, “Do I really need this, or can I just keep using my trusty old hand weeder?” 

Here’s the thing, though. Investing in an ergonomic weeder can actually save you money in the long run. Think about all those pain relief creams, hot packs, or even visits to the chiropractor after a long day of bending over. I used to have a whole cabinet filled with those things, like a mini pharmacy for my gardening woes. Since I started using the ergonomic weeder, my back pain has significantly decreased. Less pain means fewer trips to the doctor, which equals more money in my pocket. 

Now, if you’re on a tight budget, there are affordable alternatives or even DIY options. You could take an old garden tool and modify it for better grip and leverage. Or you could join a local gardening group where members sometimes swap tools. Have you ever tried that? It’s like a treasure hunt for gardening goodies! Investing in your health is worth every penny, don’t you think?

## Conclusions
  
  
So, there you have it. My backyard revolution in a nutshell. If you're a gardening enthusiast like me, don't let back pain and discomfort hold you back. Invest in an ergonomic weeder and watch your gardening game go from zero to hero. Trust me, your back will thank you. Happy weeding!",1,1732871439.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False

""This is amazing! But when’s the mobile version coming out?""

That’s when it hit us: Face swaps should be portable, effortless, and available anytime. So, after months of late nights, countless tests, and probably way too much coffee, Video Face Swap AI came to mobile. Now, whether you’re at home, on a break, or hanging out with friends, you can create hilarious videos on the spot.

What’s even more exciting? We’ve just hit $3.6K in revenue! 🎉

It’s surreal knowing something that started as a fun side project has turned into a tool that people love and use to unleash their creativity.

Why Video Face Swap AI?

Instant laughs: Swap faces into movies, sitcoms, or viral videos in seconds.

Zero hassle: No fancy setups, no computer needed—just grab your phone and go.

Pure fun: Whether you’re making yourself the lead in Friends or turning your dog into the star of The Avengers, the possibilities are endless.

We’re so proud of how far we’ve come, but this is just the beginning. We’d LOVE to hear your thoughts:

What features would make Video Face Swap AI even better?

**Why Nagano Tonic Is the Secret to a Better You**

If you’re tired of feeling drained, sluggish, or just “off,” let me tell you about a game-changer that’s about to flip the script on your health: Nagano Tonic. This isn’t just another drink; it’s a carefully crafted elixir inspired by the timeless wellness traditions of Nagano, Japan. With every sip, you’re not just quenching thirst—you’re rejuvenating your body, energizing your mind, and giving your health the upgrade it’s been begging for.

**What’s Inside? The Ingredients That Make Nagano Tonic a Health Powerhouse**

Nagano Tonic isn’t just thrown together—it’s meticulously designed with nature’s finest.

It’s ancient wisdom bottled for modern living.

**A Taste So Good, It Feels Like a Cheat Code**

Here’s the deal: most health drinks taste like lawn clippings. Not Nagano Tonic. The bright, citrusy notes of yuzu and kabosu hit you first—a refreshing, almost joyful zing. Then comes the warmth of ginger, wrapping it all up with a touch of earthy ginseng. It’s balanced, it’s luxurious, and it’s so satisfying you’ll forget it’s actually good for you. Drink it straight or mix it into your favorite cocktail—you’re winning either way.

**More Energy, Zero Crash**

Forget about those jittery coffee highs and mid-afternoon crashes. Nagano Tonic delivers real energy, the kind that feels smooth, steady, and natural. Whether you’re powering through your morning or dodging that 3 PM slump, this tonic keeps you on your game. No caffeine. No nonsense. Just pure, plant-powered vitality that works with your body, not against it.

**Wellness You Can Feel, Results You Can See**

Nagano Tonic doesn’t stop at energy—it’s a full-body reset in a bottle. Antioxidants for your immune system? Check. Botanicals to support digestion and balance? Double-check. It’s like giving your health a first-class upgrade without even trying. And the best part? You feel the difference. Clearer mind, better mood, stronger body—it’s all yours.

**Sustainability That Speaks to Your Soul**

I'm 32F and I'm a psychologist. My friend invited me out for coffee and told me beforehand that her friend, Amelia, was coming along and asked if it would be okay because she wanted to talk to me, maybe ask for advice.

I usually don't mind doing that with my friends but this was a complete stranger so I made sure to tell her that Amelia would be getting me, not psychologist me. You get two different people, one is blunt and sarcastic and the other one is professional and mindful. I told her if Amelia wants to seek me professionally, she needs to book an appointment. 

My friend reassured me that it was just girls talk. It was yesterday, we started it off by light convo, getting to know each other, joking a bit before Amelia dived into her issue. She's 29 and is dating a 36 year old man who has a 10 year old son. They've been dating for a year and a half, she met the son 6 months ago and they're now moved in together. The son was okay with her at first but now that she moved into his space, he's rejecting her. From what she described, she's trying to straight up bribe him with gifts into accepting her and he's not having it. 

He refuses to come out with Amelia for a fun day out alone so they can bond, leaves the table when she gets touchy with his father, often leaves the room when she walks in, doesn't listen to her when she demands he does something but if it comes from his father, he has no issue doing it etc.

I just listened and when she looked at me and asked me how to make him respect her and see her as a parental figure, I didn't sugarcoat my opinion and told her that she's coming in too strong. She's essentially just the kid's dad's girlfriend right now -she cut me off and said they're getting engaged soon which I ignored and continued- and that just because she moved in doesn't mean she became an automatic parent. The kid is right to feel however he feels because he's a kid. The way he sees it is that she's encroaching on his life with his dad. They've been a 2 person unit for all of his life, he doesn't know anything else.

She did not like that at all and said that he should be getting used to it, it's happening whether he likes it or not. That honestly made me change my opinion of her and I didn't like her anymore so I told her that right now, she may think it's her house, her man, her life, her rules but it was the kid's house first, the kid's dad first and his life first and she's the intruder in that equation. I also said that she needs to work on meeting the kid halfway, both her and his father so they can build something new for him. That's basically the main points of it but the actual conversation went on for 2 hours. Amelia didn't like anything I said, made that very clear and left shortly after. My friend who was defending her throughout it was glaring at me and asked me what the fuck was that?

I told her that Amelia asked an advice from a stranger, what was she expecting? If she was my friend or patient, maybe I would've coddled her feelings more/been more delicate. My friend said I'm a professional dickhead and left.

When i went to get it repaired, the warranty was out, thus the repair centre asked for 2000 and more for cleaning (Got it cleaned for 500 with new pastes from unauthorized). But Another thing, When that Technician opened the Back of the laptop, there were 2 loose screws just hanging around the ssd, Thats when he told me that the Laptop was refurbised, Now i see why the price was low but (Look at the Image, I keep ss of stuff i buy at that exact point). It wasn't specified to be Refurbished anywhere and it was during festive sales so the price wasn't that sketchy. Flipkart sucks so bad to buy stuff from, So does Acer, Just Dissapointed....Also for the Wifi issue i went on with the Ethernet Cable setup to avoid using Wifi, But now when i did set it all up, even the Ethernet keeps on disconnecting. So fucking mad rn idk what to do lmao, Maybe gotta buy new ports cz i can't afford a new laptop ;-;

1h2ho3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1h2ho3w/help_please/,Help please,"Hi guys I have been dieting since February this year. I was at 96kg at the start and very quickly went down to 85 1-2 months. After that it started to slow down. I went down to 80kg in another 1-2 months and after that I could not lose anymore. Due to this I started binging on my days off or weekends and I would fluctuate between 79-83kg. It is now December and after a month of hardcore focus I am still at 79kg. I believe that my body is using muscle instead of fat to fuel. I think this is partly due to my diet that lacks micronutrients. 

I am a delivery driver and on the days I am working I burn ~700kcal according to my Apple Watch.

My BMR is ~1750kcal

Here is what I eat pretty much every day:

Prawn mayo sandwich 300kcal
Light latte coffee 75kcal
Instant ramen 400-500kcal
Up to 3 packs of chocolate rice cakes 250kcal per pack
2-6litres water 

This is what it’s like most days. Sometimes things get substituted I like cans of soup 200kcal each. Or slice of bakery pizza instead of sandwich 250kcal. Sometimes I have 1 pack of rice cakes sometimes 2. I feel like I am at a calorie deficit every single day. And nothing!

Like the calories I am eating are not doing anything to me. Last kilo I lost I could not even tell that anything has changed not even my face. My face looks bloated as if I had a McDonald’s yesterday.

1h2hl7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveAndDeepspace/comments/1h2hl7r/the_ultimate_sylus_database_lore_theories_and_all/,"The Ultimate Sylus Database: Lore, Theories, and All the Speculative Chaos in One Place","Hey everyone! 🖖 It’s the perfect moment to throw my Sylus Database into the chaos of Reddit. I mean, y’all are rewatching *everything* and debating, so your comments, theories, and corrections in other threads are helping me refine it! Originally, I wanted to wait a month or more until I had more content analysed, but… let’s be real — there’s no better time *(and Reddit has been in an uproar since the 28th of November* 😁*).* It cannot be called 'Ultimate' at the moment, but I hope I have enough drive and passion to make it one.

# What the [Database](https://wobbly-juice-d6a.notion.site/SYLUS-WIKI-144e239292b2803c86c8c8054090a6f3) Is

This is a lovingly obsessive Sylus-centric database. It includes:

* Story chapters
* Anecdotes
* Memories
* Myths
* SMS and call logs
* Event stories
* *And maybe in the future Momoment posts (if they’re lore-relevant).*

The goal? To create a comprehensive timeline, dive into the deepest corners of Sylus’s story, and connect every symbol, anchor, and myth like a conspiracy theorist on too much coffee. ☕ The amount of time I’ve spent on this... let’s just say I could’ve written *my own* otome game by now. But hey, I regret nothing — this is my happy chaos, even if I’m the only one who ends up using it.

# How It’s Made

I used Notion to build the database and published it as a [web link](https://wobbly-juice-d6a.notion.site/SYLUS-WIKI-144e239292b2803c86c8c8054090a6f3) so anyone can access it. Here’s how it’s structured:

* **Database HP:** Grouped by tags like *Timeline (Personal Timeline Theory!), Anchors (Recurring symbols, artefacts, or characters that appear across different entries)*, *Memories*, and *Anecdotes*. All tags except Timeline are hidden unless you expand them, so it won’t look cluttered. You *can* open them to see Memories or Anchors if you want to focus on those specifically, but let’s be real, these groups are more for database structure, than anyone’s practical use *(you’re welcome anyway 😅)*.
* **What Are Anchors**: Every anchor *(e.g., recurring symbols, artefacts, or characters)* has its own page, linking all stories or memories it appears in. Want all the juicy details about a specific anchor? Open its page, and you’ll find every mention plus all my+reddit ongoing theories. This section will grow as I keep analyzing more content and spiralling into Sylus' obsession. 😅 It also sometimes has visuals *(still official art or screenshot for now, but I dream of a fan-art glow-up one day 🌟)*.
* **What Is Timeline Number:** Based on my *Personal Timeline Theory*. It’s not the official chronological order but what makes sense to me after analysing everything.
* **Memories & SMS inside Story Chapters:** Some memories and SMS interactions are folded into the story chapters they belong to, so you won’t find them listed separately. I wanted the timeline to feel seamless and avoid duplications.
* **Hidden Properties & Neat Hacks:** If you love to dig, beware — opening all the hidden properties will give you *major spreadsheet vibes*. To get the clean, aesthetic look I wanted, I had to jump through some hoops:
   * Relations in Notion display vertically, which looked awful to me. So, I added Rollup property to show all the linked entries horizontally. 2 properties instead of one...
   * I also hid things like creation and edit dates because… let’s face it, no one cares.

# Entry Structure

Each entry in the database follows this format:

1. Themes
2. Background Details
3. Speech and Interactions
4. Sylus Character & Development
5. Protagonist Character & Development
6. Symbolism and Foreshadowing
7. Chronological Placement
8. Card Art Analysis
9. Assumptions About Lore/Plot/Final Destiny
10. Script

If something isn’t in the source material, I remove that section for neatness. Visuals are mostly official or in-game screenshots for now, though I’d love to include fan art in the future (hint hint, artists 💖).

# Questions to the Community

1. **Legal Trouble with Scripts?** Am I allowed to include full text scripts of Sylus’s stories? I’ve seen other sources doing this, but I’m unsure if it’s allowed for public sharing. Should I remove the script section altogether?
2. **Fan Art for Anchors or Database Entries?** Does anyone have any art depicting anchors or entries with a similar aesthetic? I'll credit you, of course! The current in-game screenshots feel... off to me *(damn perfectionist)*. Where possible, will use official art.
3. **Help with Missing Scripts?** Does anyone have the script for *Tender Curve* or plan to collect a script from the upcoming myth? I've got everything else, but I don't have the time to get the text from the remaining memories and game events.

Check out the peanuts in the database, have fun speculating! And if you find any mistakes or have genius-level theories, feel free to let me know on Reddit! I am doing it for myself, but maybe some of you will find it helpful — or at least entertaining! 😎

Long post ahead as I'll be unleashing years of pent up frustration. I apologize for the novel.

Obligatory note: Using a throwaway account as my family and friends follow my primary.

My ex is an entitled spoiled brat. 

The first red flag was when I had to take an Uber home from an office party at 3am in the morning. The vehicle that arrived was beat up and the interior smelled of sweat and cigarette smoke. The driver was unkept and in a mood. Generally it wasn't the most ideal pick up a lone female would want to have in the dead of night. The details all matched though and it took a good while to book a ride so I decided to hop in for the 10min ride. For added security (and just general comfort) I called my ex who I knew was still up - I had texted him beforehand saying I'm heading home and he responded. I had also informed him I'd like to keep him on the phone for safety to which he agrees to. 

He answers the phone but quickly says ""I'm in the middle of a game. You'll be fine."" then hangs up. I stare at my screen in frustration and end up calling my best friend. They were asleep but answered and stayed on with me for the remaining 8mins. 

He never apologized. He said I was being dramatic and Uber is safe. I forgave him because I figured that yeah, I'm alive, I'm unharmed. And I liked him a lot. Maybe I'm wrong.

Next red flag. My first trip with his friends. Beachside villa, food and booze. And drugs. 

I've been curious about x. And I've met his friends on several occasions and I trusted them. He offered and I figured sure, why not, this is the best environment to do so. It's controlled, it's safe, and there were assigned sober monitors who would ensure no one did anything stupid. 

I took a small dose, just enough to feel the kick. He said I was fine and gave me another. I now had a total half dose. I had a decent experience. Come morning however, I would have what they call ""rolling"" wherein you have sudden spells of vertigo and would cause a lot of flopping over, tripping, and falling. Fairly common for people not used to the drug. As a first time user, I was lowkey panicking. And all of them looked after me. All of them except for him, who was just watching from the side having his coffee. 

It was a generally good experience though, with his friends, so I chose to ignore that growing irritation in the back of my head.

Final straw: He got COVID. 

The whole lockdown he would push me to leave my home and go out with him and his friends in spite of my explanation that I couldn't risk exposure as I live with my senior parents who both have debilitating illnesses. He laughed at me for being afraid of a silly virus. Even when his own friend brought home the virus which later killed his (the friend's) father, he still would beg me to come out. 

One day he returns home with the flu. I suspected he had caught the Virus. I gave him clear instructions to isolate as he lives with his parents and younger siblings and elderly house staff. He spent the whole time moaning and groaning about how boring it was in his room, a room that has cable TV, his gaming PC, his phone, books, wifi. He would complain about the food they'd bring him (think appropriately healthy food for someone with the flu). He'd refuse to wash his own utensils because he only had hand soap in his ensuite bathroom and would insist the elderly staff still do dishes for him, unprotected, exposed.

I had insisted he take a test and he refused, saying I was being dramatic. Finally his mother gave up after 2 weeks and ordered him to the hospital. I told him to take all essentials because they definitely weren't letting him back out. He only brought his half charged  phone and wallet. I later get a text saying he was positive and he can't leave.

I send him a list of things to ask his family to bring as I've had friends and family experience the same thing. He said it was unnecessary and didn't forward the list to them. He spends the next few days complaining about how he doesn't have this or that - all things I had put on the list.

The hospital, understandably, was full and could only spare a bed in a shared room. He apparently was having the worst, most embarrassing time of his life because he had to pee in a bottle and he couldn't take a shower everyday. The anger I received when I responded saying that there are people who are being treated on the street because of how full some hospitals are and I'm sure no one is peeking through the curtains to watch a grown man pee into a bottle (adding ""you've peed in bottles before. imagine how bad it must be for women in the same situation"" did not help my case). 

Because he's such an important person /s the hospital was finally able to get him a private room. His response? It's so awful because only Harry Potter is showing on the TV. This in spite of having a fully paid  Netflix subscription that he can access on his laptop and plus the stupid game he loves to play on his phone. 

I broke up with him. I was done. But goddamn did I stupidly still love that man.

He asks me to visit his place a few months after the lift of the lockdown. For closure, as we broke up via text and hadn't spoken in person since.

I show up. We talk. We cuddle. He starts for my clothes. I say no. He asks to move to the bed but only to cuddle. I acquiesce (yes, I'm a heartbroken dumbass). He asks I take off my clothes to keep the bed clean. It's something we've always done even in the past so I oblige. I still felt safe. Until I didn't. 

He was too big, too heavy, too strong. I'm not a screamer but I did push, I did say no. It was over quickly. I clean up. I don't say a word because he has a look on his face that made me feel that if I start a fight I'll only be able leave with more taken from me. But I'm crying. And all he says is ""Why. What did you expect by coming here. That we'd just talk?"" 

I leave. He never apologized.

I can't file a report because it will cause me more harm than good and his family is powerful in a way I didn't realize. I'll be shunned by my community while his parents will find a way to scrub his records clean all while further dragging my name through the mud for slandering their little angel.

I think I'm lucky in the sense that I might not be as broken by the experience as other victims are. I felt dirty and used but also a little guilty because maybe I did walk into that knowingly. I still even cared for the asshole after all that. I don't know. I'm still figuring it out but I'm so far alright and I've gotten past it all. The few I've told have been great support to me, extremely patient and kind but firm.

I am pissed though that he's still out there living his best life. He still tries to reach out to me, get me to fall for him again. I can see him stalking my LinkedIn because he's gone from my social media. And all this while in a relationship with a girl I know who's been badmouthing me for years (that's another shitty story for another day).

Apologies again for the long post. There's been so much more that I haven't put down, all buried inside of me for the past 3 years. I'm glad to have been able to finally let it out into the universe. Hopefully Karma will handle the rest.",2,1732869522.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

If you did or if ever you will do, please beware of a man named Jay Domingo.

HE is a 39-year-old lecherous and egocentric man of Angeles City, Pampanga. He is an old man who is still living under the roof of his parents. In the app he is portraying to find his life partner or seeking for long-term relationship as what his profile bio will tell you, BUT it will get you all wrong. As he was just using it as a bait as if saying he was seriously looking for match, but to tell you the dark truth, it was a false advertisement just to get dates, get laid and taste all women he finds attracted to. Technically his preys will consist of girls or women ranging from a senior highschool to ladies of early mid-thirties.

The tactic of this man involves inviting you to have a coffee date with him and telling you stories about his exes. More particularly about his failed engagement in 2020. As according to him his fiancée has found another man and leaves him hanging during the pandemic. A very sad story, right? Surely you will fall for this and will give him the empathy as the pitiful guy that has been cheated to. But the thing is he is the one who is playing around and looking for pleasure beyond his fiancée's knowledge.

In addition to that, he will also be sharing to you stories about his past dates. A senior high, who is maltreated at home. A lady who always bring her mother as a chaperone to their dates. His other emotionally immature dates and the list will go on... He will even tell you how he touches them and do stuffs with their body.

When he sees that you are not liking him or not attracted to him. He will make efforts to make you fall for him, he will be offering services such as to do house repairs, free transportation (hatid-sundo), accompany you to do stuffs like shopping, groceries, etc. On top of that he will be bringing the Pomeranian dog (the one he had on his profile) on your dates, to make you so into it like he is really engaging you to see him as a good person who is caring but NOT. Because of his fake gestures, you will think that there will be something serious going on between the two of you. 

But little did you know he is still dating other girls he was chatting on the app and doing the exact things he was offering and doing for you while you think you are dating. Once you fall on his tactics and see that you started to develop an emotional attachment, he will be limiting his interaction with you and until the day comes that he will be ghosting you. And for that you will be questioning yourself worth, even asking yourself what have you done wrong?

There is NOTHING wrong with you. It is not YOU; it is HIM. He is the one who is afraid of commitment. He doesn't like to deal with relationship conflicts and when he feels that his date is getting too clingy, he becomes so distant, boastful, do things that will make you angry for you to give up on him. He is a Tito playboy that is just messing your naïve heart. He is coward jerk who is afraid to tell you that he just used you to shortly satisfy his needs.

You will observe this on his chat that he is so proud of himself. Will tell you that he is late bloomer, and he is not dating cheap girls or paying girls for pleasure. Surely, he does not because he is doing it cheaply in the app.
Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with dating and knowing a person and have an interaction with them.

But using someone as a playtime is never an acceptable thing to do. Especially for those innocent ladies who are searching or looking for a decent kind of relationship.

This is a message for all the girls and women out there to be cautious in using dating platform or online dating app.

To be meticulous in getting to know the guy well. Don't fall for their good-looking profile, persistent fake chat or actions and stories. As scammers are not only using technologies for money but perv are now using technology to take advantage of innocent ladies. I hope this article will awaken all the women out there to protect themselves to the people that can harm them and question their self-worth.",54,1732868836.0,OffMyChestPH,28,0.97,False

1h2h91j,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1h2h91j/budgetfriendly_furniture_ideas_that_look_luxurious/,Budget-Friendly Furniture Ideas That Look Luxurious,"Creating a sophisticated and elegant home doesn’t have to cost a fortune. With thoughtful choices and a keen eye for detail, you can furnish your space with pieces that exude luxury while staying within your budget. Here are some practical tips and ideas for budget-friendly furniture that looks high-end, featuring key items like a [2 seater sofa](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/sofas), [modern furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture), and insights on shopping smart at your favorite [home furniture shop](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/).

# 1. Choose a 2 Seater Sofa for a Chic and Compact Look

A **2 seater sofa** is the perfect blend of style and practicality for smaller spaces. Opt for sleek designs with clean lines, tufted upholstery, or velvet finishes to add a touch of sophistication. These sofas not only save space but also serve as a statement piece in your living room. Pair it with accent cushions in luxurious fabrics like silk or faux fur to elevate the overall look.

# 2. Mix High-End Looks with Affordable Finds

One of the secrets to achieving a luxurious aesthetic on a budget is mixing affordable furniture with statement decor. For instance, pair a simple wooden coffee table with an oversized, metallic vase or a designer rug. Shopping at a reputable **home furniture shop** allows you to find these hidden gems, often at competitive prices.

# 3. Invest in Modern Furniture with Timeless Appeal

**Modern furniture** emphasizes clean lines, neutral tones, and minimalist designs—elements that naturally convey elegance. Look for pieces in materials like glass, metal, or marble-inspired finishes. A small investment in contemporary chairs, nesting tables, or a streamlined TV unit can transform your living space into a high-end retreat.

# 4. Create Layers with Textures and Accessories

Luxury isn’t just about the furniture—it’s also about how you style your home. Enhance your **2 seater sofa** with plush throws, add curtains in rich, flowing fabrics, or display books and decor items on open shelves. Layering textures helps create a warm, inviting space that looks expensive without breaking the bank.

# 5. Shop Smart at Local Home Furniture Shops

A trusted **home furniture shop** is your best ally when hunting for budget-friendly yet luxurious furniture. Look for seasonal sales, discount days, or package deals that include a mix of furniture and decor items. Many shops now offer financing options, so you can gradually build the home of your dreams without a significant upfront investment.

# 6. Repurpose and Reimagine

Sometimes, the most affordable way to add a luxurious touch is by repurposing what you already own. Give your old wooden dining chairs a modern twist with a fresh coat of paint or reupholster a tired armchair in a trendy fabric. Adding mirrored or metallic elements to existing furniture can also instantly elevate its look.

# 7. Focus on Lighting and Ambiance

Good lighting has the power to make any space feel luxurious. Add modern pendant lights, table lamps with metallic bases, or even LED strips under furniture for an upscale effect. Proper lighting highlights the beauty of your furniture and creates a welcoming atmosphere.

# 8. Opt for Neutral Tones and Cohesive Palettes

Luxurious interiors often feature neutral tones like beige, gray, or cream. Incorporate these hues into your furniture choices, such as a light gray **2 seater sofa** or a beige armchair. A cohesive color palette makes the space feel polished and well-designed, regardless of your budget.

By following these tips and exploring your local **home furniture shop** for versatile, **modern furniture** options, you can craft a home that feels luxurious without overspending. A little creativity, strategic purchases, and thoughtful styling can go a long way in achieving a high-end look for your space.

Motherhood is a beautiful journey filled with love, challenges, and countless responsibilities. Among these responsibilities, managing your family's finances stands out as a critical skill that can significantly impact your family's quality of life. Budgeting isn't just about tracking dollars and cents—it's about creating financial stability, reducing stress, and providing opportunities for your children.

**Understanding The Unique Financial Challenges Of Motherhood**

Moms wear multiple hats: caregiver, educator, nurse, chef, and often the primary financial manager of the household. The economic landscape for mothers has become increasingly complex. Rising costs of childcare, education, healthcare, and everyday essentials make budgeting more crucial than ever.

Many mothers face unique financial scenarios: some are single parents, others balance work and home responsibilities, and many make sacrifices to prioritize their children's needs. Each of these scenarios requires a tailored approach to budgeting that considers both short-term necessities and long-term financial goals.

**Getting Started: The Foundation Of Family Budgeting**

**1. Track Every Single Expense**

The first step in effective budgeting is complete transparency about your spending. For one month, track every single expense—from major bills to that quick coffee run or impulse purchase at the grocery store checkout. Use smartphone apps, spreadsheets, or traditional notebooks to record each transaction.

This exercise isn't about judgment but understanding. You'll likely discover spending patterns you weren't previously aware of. Those small $5 purchases can quickly add up, potentially revealing areas where you can cut back without feeling deprived.

**2. Categorize Your Spending**

After tracking expenses, categorize them into clear groups:

* Essential expenses (housing, utilities, groceries, healthcare)
* Child-related expenses (education, childcare, clothing, activities)
* Debt payments
* Savings and investments
* Discretionary spending (entertainment, dining out, personal purchases)

This categorization helps create a realistic and flexible budget that accommodates your family's specific needs.

**Smart Budgeting Strategies For Moms**

**Create Multiple Savings Streams**

Diversify your savings approach:

* **Emergency Fund:** Aim to save 3-6 months of living expenses
* **Children's Education Fund:** Consider 529 plans or other education savings accounts
* **Retirement Savings:** Don't neglect your long-term financial security
* **Short-term Goal Fund:** For family vacations or major purchases

**Embrace Cost-Cutting Without Sacrificing Quality Of Life**

Being budget-friendly doesn't mean being boring or restrictive. Consider these strategies:

* Meal planning to reduce food waste and eating out
* Buying generic brands
* Using cashback credit cards responsibly
* Taking advantage of free community activities for children
* Shopping secondhand for children's clothing and toys
* Utilizing library resources for books and educational materials

**Involve The Entire Family In Financial Literacy**

Budgeting is an excellent opportunity to teach children about money management. Involve older children in age-appropriate discussions about financial decisions. This not only helps them understand family finances but also instils crucial life skills.

**Technology: Your Budgeting Ally**

Numerous apps and online tools can simplify budgeting:

* **YNAB (You Need A Budget):** Proactive budgeting approach
* **Empower:** Investment and budgeting tracking
* **Goodbudget:** Envelope budgeting method digitally

These tools can automate tracking, provide insights, and help you stay consistent with your financial goals.

**Managing Unexpected Expenses**

Life is unpredictable, especially with children. Build flexibility into your budget:

* Maintain an emergency fund
* Consider supplemental income streams
* Review and adjust your budget quarterly
* Look into insurance options that provide financial protection

**Mental Health and Budgeting**

Remember, budgeting isn't just about numbers—it's about reducing financial stress. Be kind to yourself. Perfect budgeting doesn't exist, but consistent, mindful financial management does.

If budgeting feels overwhelming, consider:

* Financial counseling
* Online budgeting workshops
* Support groups for mothers
* Professional financial planning services

**Investing In Yourself**

While managing family finances, don't forget to invest in your personal and professional development. Upskilling, pursuing flexible work options, or developing side hustles can provide additional financial security.

**Final Thoughts: Your Financial Journey**

Budgeting as a mom is a continuous learning process. Some months will be easier than others. The key is consistency, adaptability, and maintaining a positive attitude.

Your financial goals might include:

* Providing quality education for your children
* Creating memorable family experiences
* Building long-term financial stability
* Teaching your children valuable money management skills

Every small step you take towards better financial management is a step towards a more secure and stress-free family life.

**Practical Next Steps**

1. Schedule a family finance meeting
2. Download a budgeting app
3. Set clear, achievable financial goals
4. Review and adjust your budget monthly
5. Celebrate your financial wins, no matter how small

Budgeting isn't about perfection—it's about progress. As a mom, you're already an expert at navigating complex challenges. Apply that same resilience, creativity, and love to your family's financial journey.

Your financial wellness is a gift not just to yourself but to your entire family. Embrace the journey, stay informed, and remember: every financially savvy decision you make today is an investment in your family's bright future.",1,1732868031.0,Mom,0,1.0,False
