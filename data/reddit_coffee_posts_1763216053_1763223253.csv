I feel like a I should get a medal for getting through it. It could have been a really good book. In fact, I'm going to call it an essential read for Masons. He does bring a lot of wisdom into it and makes a lot of points to reflect upon. But Pike had such a huge problem with verbal diarrhea and a fear of ending a sentence, that it's an exhausting book to read. There is so much unnecessary fat in this book it's easy to miss the meat. It's almost like he was trying to impress upon the reader his vast knowledge of the world's collective religious and mythical ideology out of an insecurity, perhaps because he was not a college graduate. I think it's clear he followed no official religion and delved, instead, into paths of mysticism and maybe spiritual alchemy and things I'm not aware of. Kabbalah and Hermiticsm are frequently mentioned. Kaballah is actually a very interesting thing to study and is widely accepted in Judaism. But it can't be blended with my own Christian faith. It can, however, serve a symbolic and philosophical purpose. Plus it has an account and explanation of creation that for all I know might be true. The book does provide illumination on the Scottish Rite degrees and it does have quite a bit of value. I think it could be rewritten and reduced by 75%. Even though I hated reading it, I would still recommend it. But you're going to have to brew A LOT of coffee. ",1,1763223238.0,freemasonry,0,1.0,False

Age: 30

Occupation: Registered Client Service Associate

Hometown: Southern California

Number of PTO days and how you accrue them: I used a total of 40 hours to take the whole week off, 3 days for the trip and 2 more to just take the whole week off. I currently can earn 16 days through the whole year and accrue them at a rate of 10.67 hours a month.

# Assets + Debt

We currently have \~$46,000 across IRAs, 401k, 457, 401a, and my husband L’s HRA account. L also contributes to a pension but I’m not sure exactly how much is in that, I think somewhere around $15k.

Equity if you’re a homeowner: N/A

Savings account balance: $38,121.99

Checking account balance: $119 (personal), $700 (joint bill account)

Credit card debt: $2,146.93 (Chase)

Most of this is debt from my art business that I’ve been chipping away at, other part is my sister’s part for her package from this trip that she’s paying me back for. This is also our daily spend card and paying off our monthly spending covers the statement balance so we don’t accrue interest.

Student loan debt: $18,091.05

Car loan: $27,418.15

# Income

Main Job Monthly Take Home: $9,476 together (I bring in $3,450, L $6,026) 

I do occasionally get comped by my boss but that’s not guaranteed so I don’t count on it in our monthly income.

Aside from taxes, I pay $184 a month for health insurance just for me, contribute $250 a month to my 401k, and $100 a month to my HSA. L contributes $398 to his 457, $22 for union dues + our vision and dental insurance, and $509 to his pension.

Side Gig Monthly Take Home: $10-50 a month. I have an Etsy shop for my art but that’s been sporadic since I haven’t posted art in almost a year. I also do apps like Fetch and Receipt Hog and will randomly get payouts for those.

Other Monthly Income: L receives $859 a month from the VA for disability.

# Travel Expenses

Going on the trip was myself, my parents, and my little sister, Z. The expenses listed are all that I paid for with the total expense that was split if applicable in parentheses. For most of them, the difference was paid by my mom and Z. This was a trip for my dad as it’s been his dream to go see the Packers play at Lambeau Field so we hatched a plan originally that he wouldn’t pay for anything. But my dad being my dad was difficult about that so I let him pay for seats for our flights, trip insurance for our flights, seat cushions, and then for his own goodies from the Packers Pro Shop. He also bought me a blanket and my sister a jacket at the Packers Pro Shop.

Onto the expenses!!

*Transportation:* 

Flights - $726.43 ($1232.29) for flights for 3 people from LAX to Milwaukee. This includes flights, seats, and travel insurance. Z flew in separately from Florida.

Rental car - $253.29. Booked through Costco for Nov 9-12. Added on road side assistance when I picked up the car for $10 /day. 

Extended Parking - $83.99 to cover parking at LAX from Nov 9-12

*Accommodations:*

Pet boarding - $270 for one of our pups. We have three but one is a young, freshly turned 1 year old pup (Belgian Malinois/Australian Shepherd mix) and with L being gone from home 12-13 hours a day between his commute and 10 hour shift, we felt it was better to board him for the length of my trip. Our boarding place gives them tons of play time and he’s always managed to find a friend to play with when he’s there.

Our other two are older dogs (8 and 7) and my in laws can help out with them. We currently live in their casita/mother-in-law suite so they’re able to pop over and let them out while L is at work.

*Pre-Vacation Spending:*

Packages from Event USA - $1,927.94 ($3,875.94)

This is for 4 packages + an extra night at the hotel + upgraded seats + taxes and fees. The base package is $789 and I opted to add an extra night for $240 because we wanted to stay an extra day to do a stadium tour and the Hall of Fame.

The package includes the game tickets, hotel (Best Western in our case), and access to a tailgating party. The base package includes seats at the end zone and we later decided to upgrade our tickets to a corner section. 

Lambeau Field tour + Hall of Fame - $99.56 ($239.10)

We opted for the Legendary Combo and this was the cost for 4 adults. 

Accessories/supplies - $74.64

I bought a couple of odds and ends, mostly buying things to stay as warm as possible during the game.

Gloves with touchscreen tips - $6.84

Stadium seat cushion - $21.54 (my dad bought the remaining 3)

Clear bags, 2 pack - $17.39

Leggings - $9.99

Hand warmer packets - $8.12

Scarf - $10.76

# Travel Diary

*Day 1 - Saturday/Sunday - Travel Day!*

8:30pm - Our travel begins late Saturday! We’re doing a redeye so I head off to my parents’ to pick them up and journey off to LAX. I had been keeping an eye on both ours and Z’s itineraries all day to check for any cancellations or delays due to the FAA ordered flight reductions. I thought we were in the clear as both American and Delta had posted in the app that they had done all their planned cancellations through Monday and then suddenly when I’m out to dinner with my husband earlier in the night, I get a call from my dad and texts from Z freaking out because Delta suddenly cancelled her first leg. She managed to find another nearby-ish flight and I booked her a backup flight through American just in case.

11:30pm - My parents and I are settled in at the terminal. Security went smoothly thankfully and we make a pit stop at the convenience store to purchase some water. **($18.25)**

5:45am - We arrive in Dallas for our layover! While on the flight, I did purchase wifi. **($20)** I was already planning to to make sure if anything went sideways with our next flight, I could deal with it then and there instead of waiting until we got to Dallas. Add on top of that the scare with Z earlier, I also wanted to make sure her first flight took off and she didn’t need any help as well.

6:30am - We get breakfast at McDonalds, which my mom covers. My dad mentions wanting an apple pie so I get that for him. **($2.15)** As we’re eating, I think about how we’re in the Dallas airport and my parents are clad in Packers gear. It’s kind of amusing how already since LAX people have stopped to talk to my parents about the Packers or just yell a passing GO PACK! (or in one case, GO EAGLES!) While we’re waiting around, I see Z’s second flight took off so I cancel the flight with American I had booked for her. Luckily they offer me a refund back to my card so I take that.

11am - We have all arrived safely in Milwaukee! Z and my mom both want coffee so we make a pitstop at Starbucks before going off for our bags. I technically covered it but my Starbucks card was already loaded with a combo of a previous reload, a gift from a work friend, and a gift card I redeemed from Microsoft Rewards.

We go pick up our rental car and I decide to add on roadside assistance for $10 a day. (Spoiler alert: I will be grateful for this later.) 

12:30pm - We stop for lunch at Public Market in downtown Milwaukee. We do a lap of the place to see our options and settle for a combo of Aladdin’s **($14.57)** and Pitaworks **($35.45)**. As we were walking around, I saw some yummy desserts at C. Adam’s Bakery so on the way out, my dad and I get cookies. **($7.50)** We pay for parking on our way out of the lot. **($6)**

4pm - We arrive in Green Bay! As soon as we got our first glimpse of Lambeau Field coming in, both of my parents were like “THERE IT IS!” We get checked in to our hotel and throw our bags down in our room. We bundle up a bit more (my ears froze just walking through a Target parking lot when we had stopped for a bathroom break) and then go brave the cold to go to Lambeau Field. Our hotel is literally two blocks over and it’s so nice. We take lots of pictures and my dad is smiling so much just from seeing the stadium. He’s also asking us to take pictures of him and he never asks us to take pictures. He’ll participate in them but he won’t ask for them and this just tells me how happy he is.

Once we finish our photoshoot, we pop into the Packers Pro Shop and do a little merch shopping. Z finds a cup that says “Best Dad” and asks if we can get it for him. I get that along with another mug and a Lambeau Field magnet for myself, and a magnet of a cow wearing a cheesehead for Z. **($68.19)**

7pm - We decide to do dinner at Olive Garden because a nice warm bowl of soup sounds great. While we wait for our table, we run to Target for a couple of things and my mom covers that along with our dinner. I suspect my mom is trying to make up for the fact that I hadn’t included the rental car in our split expenses (I told her it’s because I chose to get it and she was like, “SO? WE’RE ALL GONNA USE IT.”)

8:30pm - We finally return to our hotel and collapse for the night. 

Total - $172.11

*Day 2 - Monday - GAME DAY*

8am - Most of us wake up around 6-6:30 (Z likes to sleep.) We get ready and head out for the free hotel breakfast. Once we finish up, we head out towards Appleton in search of cheese and cheese curds. My dad asks if we can do a drive around the stadium to look at how houses around it go all out for their love of the Packers. We finish our tour and go to Simon’s Specialty Cheese store.

10am - We do some DAMAGE at Simon’s. They have samples out of cheese curds and I grab one to try. They really do squeak and it’s kind of weird but they’re yummy. I grab a mozzarella and provolone to bring home and my sister shows me some freeze dried cheese dog treats which I clearly have to buy for my pups. I cover my mom’s purchases too since she covered dinner last night. **($123.70)**

11:30am - Z mentioned missing Costco the day before so my mom being my mom goes LET’S GO TO COSTCO. Unfortunately, while we’re getting out of the car, tragedy strikes. I locked the doors before shutting my door then start looking for the key fob to lock it again and find the key fob is not in my bag. Z checks her pockets since she had taken the key from me back at the hotel to warm up the car, but she didn’t have it either. I’m thankful I added roadside assistance last minute while picking up the car and that we’re also at Costco so we’re not having to hang out outside cold and miserable.

We head inside while I call to arrange someone to come out and I’m miffed because the guy mentions something about a $75 fee for using it so I’m like what was the point of paying the daily fee??? We’ll see when I get the final receipt. While we’re at Costco, I do get some gloves because the ones I got on Amazon were giving me problems trying to use my phone the night before. **($14.76)**

12:45pm - My mom gets us some pizza at the food court while waiting for the locksmith. He finally arrives and we’re rescued! I add the key fob to my regular keychain just to be safe for the rest of the trip.

4pm - We got back to the hotel earlier and relaxed awhile before heading down to the tailgate included in our package. I didn’t expect much and we only really went down because free food was included. All it resulted in was cold, sad burgers (WITH NO CHEESE) and my dad gets a beer before we retreat back to our room for a little longer. I will say though, the Eagles fans wearing the Philadelphia cream cheese hats is the funniest thing.

5:30pm - We head down to the stadium!! We take more pictures inside and head to find our seats. My dad gets a little emotional actually walking out and seeing the field and he’s again smiling so wide. We take a second to take it all in before me, my mom, and Z go off to get some snacks and drinks. **($46.88)**

9pm - The game so far has been largely uneventful and I am a Popsicle so I go for a walk to warm up and to continue looking for cheese curds. My mom and Z had left just before half time to get us coffee and hot chocolate and couldn’t find any curds and I was like THEY’RE IN HERE SOMEWHERE. I succeed in my journey and acquire fried cheese curds. **($12.12)**

10:30 - The game got a little more exciting in the second half and there was hope of overtime but the Packers couldn’t score a field goal at the last second to tie it up. I didn’t know what was going on 90% of the time but I still enjoyed myself and even had moments of excitement or going COME ON. We hike back to our hotel and now it’s a race to get to sleep because we have a tour to do tomorrow!

Total - $197.46

*Day 3 - Tuesday*

8am - Hotel breakfast again

9am - We venture back to the stadium for more pictures and the stadium tour. We’re doing the 2 hour tour since first time visiting and also who knows when we’d come again so might as well go all out. I get the best picture of my dad looking so happy when we’re walking out through the team tunnel onto the field. 

11:45am - We wrap up the stadium tour and it was really cool even as someone not even into football. Of course even more pictures were taken during it and our poor tour guide had some technical difficulties (we later discover he took a burst of selfies on my mom’s phone lmao.) We head off to lunch at Red Robin which I cover **($79.85)** and my mom gets the tip.

1pm - We return to Lambeau Field for the Hall of Fame with a quick pitstop in a nearby park to take a selfie with the big G on the stadium in the background. Again, pleasantly surprised that the Hall of Fame was very interesting even as a not football fan. They had some clips of Aaron Rodgers playing in his section and my dad’s like, “These are the kind of throws I was hoping for last night but Love wasn’t playing well.” After we finish moseying through the Hall of Fame, we make one last dash through the store.

4pm - We’re all done at the stadium and we head off to Costco to get gas. **($23.47)** There’s a Starbucks nearby so I pop in to see if there’s any Hello Kitty merch left because we’ve been seeing dregs throughout our visit. No cups BUT they do have the Hello Kitty shaped gift card so I load some money onto there for myself. **($10)**

6pm - We relax at the hotel for a while and start to pack up for the trip home. My mom determines we’re going to need a third suitcase so we head out to Target before dinner to pick up that suitcase. Z is like, “Let’s look at the Starbucks to see if they have anything.” and I go, “They probably don’t since we were just here and they didn’t have anything.” But we go look anyways and they have done the impossible and restocked on Hello Kitty merch. I grab the plushie (!!!) and the mug. **($71.63)**

On the way out, a nice lady says, “You guys look like a Packers family!” and she makes small talk with my parents as we walk back to our cars. She tells us how Titletown is all lit up for Christmas. We had been back and forth about whether or not to swing by Titletown after dinner and after hearing that, my dad decides he wants to go after all.

7pm - I introduce my parents to Texas Roadhouse and it gets an A+. Since I covered lunch, my mom gets dinner and I take care of the tip. **($17)**

8pm - We take a little stroll around Titletown before retiring to our hotel for the night.

Total - $201.95

*Day 4 - Wednesday - Travel Day*

6am - It’s an early morning since we have to drive back to Milwaukee. I finish most of my packing as the rest of my family gets up and then we head down to breakfast. We find the receipt for our stay outside our door and it shows $0, which is a pleasant surprise since Event USA mentioned the hotel charging $20 a night for parking and I had accounted for that in my spending.

7:30am - We wave goodbye to Lambeau Field as we begin our journey back home.

9:30am - I stop to fill up the rental car closer to the airport. **($17.17)** We drop it off and the receipt isn’t showing the $75 fee I was worried about so I think we’re safe from it.

10:30am - We’ve gotten all checked in with one small hiccup at TSA. My dad had bought a gift basket of cheese for my in laws, but the TSA agent made him crack it open and confiscated the beer cheese in it. I forgot about the liquid rule applying to spreads and it was too large to be allowed on the plane. We get to Z’s gate to wait with her until she takes off.

11:30am - We say goodbye to Z and then head over to our gate. I run to Starbucks to get a snack to hold me over until Dallas.

3pm - We have about a three hour layover and my mom is dying of hunger so we get Chick-Fil-A for lunch and I bully my mom to let me pay. **($37.64)** I also grab a water bottle closer to boarding. **($4.50)** While we’re waiting to board, I check Z’s flight and her second flight left without a hitch.

6pm - We finally land back at LAX and I shepherd my parents home before beginning my own journey home. I stop to get a small meal at McDonalds. **($8.88)** 

9pm - I finally get home and collapse into bed.

Total - $68.19

**Trip Totals:**

Transportation: $1,110.35

**Reflection**

Ultimately, I am eternally grateful to find myself in a place in my life where I could help make my dad’s dream a reality. He kept thanking us throughout the whole trip, saying he doesn’t know what he did to deserve this, and on the drive home he said it was more than he even hoped for. I’m glad we got to have this trip with him and it’s something that’s going to stay with me for the rest of my life. ",1,1763223180.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,0,1.0,False

Bungalow 23 is a family-friendly, dog-friendly community beer garden with plenty of open space to relax. Surrounded by 4 great bars and restaurants, it’s the perfect spot to gather, sip, and enjoy good vibes with friends, family, and furry companions. Their current on-site places include: Chick N Beer, Chinos Mexicano (asian mexican fusion), Egg N Caphe (vietnamese coffee), and Downtime (neighborhood bar with darts game). The outdoor area has cornhole, Connect 4, giant beer pong, a pool table, a very large TV screen(likely showing the OU x Alabama game), and lots of seating. They are being super kind and offering happy hour drinks while we are there(details in pics above)! Closing time is midnight, so feel free to stay late, as many of us often do. That's also for people who may need to arrive later since I'm certain that lots of us will be around until they close. I've linked their Instagram and Facebook pages below, as well.

Parking is located on the northwest corner of the block near NW 24th and Shartel and another lot is directly east of Chick N Beer. These are shown in pics above.

Again, I want to thank you all for supporting our local businesses and we are excited to show Bungalow 23 the same positive vibe that we have brought everyone and everywhere prior.

Some of us will arrive early and have orange leis to make us easier to find, which we will provide for everyone. So, if you see someone wearing an orange lei then it should be okay to approach them and verify our location and grab a lei. I'll do my best to DM everyone and feel free to DM me if you have any questions! Hope you all make it!!

1oxvken,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusVisa/comments/1oxvken/medical_bachelor_graduates_from_home_country_path/,Medical bachelor graduates from home country. Path after WHV,"
Hi everyone,

I recently got my WHV and will be landing in Australia next February. Right now I’m trying to pick up some practical skills before I arrive — things like nail tech, driving, coffee making and basic cooking — since I’ve heard these kinds of hospitality/blue-collar jobs are in high demand and easier to get when you first arrive.

That said, WHV is not my final goal. I’m hoping to eventually pursue a medical career in Australia.

A bit about my background: I completed a medical bachelor degree in China specialising in paediatrics. Unfortunately, the salary prospects and career progression for doctors in China are extremely poor. Junior doctors often earn only 3k–4k RMB/month (around 800–900 AUD), and even after more than a decade of training, many still earn just 15k–20k RMB/month (around 4k–5k AUD). On top of that, long working hours, intense pressure, and a very hierarchical system make it difficult for young doctors to grow. It’s also not a very transparent environment, which adds extra stress.

Because of all this, I decided to look for a healthier and more sustainable career path elsewhere. I was very lucky to get a WHV spot and I want to make the most of my time in Australia.

So I’m wondering — are there others with a similar background? Especially people with medical degrees who came to Australia through WHV or another temporary pathway.

What did your career path look like?
How did you manage things after the WHV years?
And how did you move toward a long-term visa or medical registration?

Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!",1,1763223110.0,AusVisa,1,1.0,False

Deputy leaves, we try to find a way to seal up the window since it’s currently raining for the next few days. Even cooler. So we find trash bags, no duct tape.

1oxvf9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/doughertydozenexposed/comments/1oxvf9c/very_concerning_behavior/,VERY CONCERNING BEHAVIOR!!!,"Alex’s video where he is clearly smashed and talking about being”lost”

There is NOONE to “thank” ie; blame for this behavior but his so called mother. This is so sad and deeply concerning. 

Yes, Alex is an adult and can make his own choices BUT he had NO proper parenting. Remember, per Lush “I’ve learned to just not ask questions specifically WHY someone does something around here” 

Not only did Alex have a tumultuous childhood, he had every move he made, every disorder he ever had, every mess up, every struggle BLASTED all over social media for millions of people to see, comment, like, dislike, make fun of, feel sorry for, lust after, and hate. 

Alex is giving you a sneak peak into the adult life of an exploited child. 

I believe the bio kids have far more issues than the adopted/ kinship kids do. FAR MORE but if you’ve noticed Lush only comments on the adopted kids and maybe boy B’s autism which she also admitted is basically self diagnosed. I believe what she actually said was they had to manipulate his symptoms to get the “official diagnosis”. 

Well… when you project your own neurotic/obsessive tendencies onto your children, they WILL start to exhibit those same behaviors. 

Those kids don’t have food insecurities- LUSH DOES!!!! She has said it so many times. SHE likes routine, SHE likes control, SHE hates change, SHE refuses to ask for help- especially when she actually should. SHE is the one who watches what she eats and basically lives off salads, Adderall, coffee and white claw, while feeding her children pounds and pounds of disgusting junk.  

Dude. This woman is sick. She has Munchhausen by proxy and you’d be hard pressed to convince me otherwise. She is hurting those kids, she is hurting the animals because she is SICK. She overfeeds as a form of self soothing.. to scratch a neurotic itch. 
She is blatantly exploiting a child that she has known for literally only THREE YEARS but desperately wants to be seen as his MOM. She is NOT. D’Shwn is NOT fostered, NOT adopted, they have legal custody, but only until he is 18. 
I pray to God D’Shwn gets out as soon as he can. Either by college, or going back to his REAL FAMILY who love him and want a relationship with him- before it gets too bad. 

If you think for a second that the same thing isn’t going to happen to DSH and H…. You are mistaken. There are THOUSANDS of pervs watching H’s “get ready with me” vlogs and she’s being served up by her own mother. 

DSH continues to show very concerning behavior every single time she puts him on camera. DEEPLY CONCERNING. Pay attention! 

If you saw her Halloween vlog- James is struggling. It is so so clear. Yet, no nurturing, no compassion, no attention.. no love shown. My heart absolutely breaks for him. I do think he and Nanna and Papa have a good relationship, thank God! They and his bio sister are his only hope for any real family connection. 

Dude… the more I type the more depressing it becomes. The Dougherty kids are just eleven out of the countless children whose lives are being ruined by child exploitation via social media family vlogging. 

Sadly, It’s only going to get worse.

1oxvela,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalSensitivities/comments/1oxvela/my_advice_and_tips_for_newcomers_to_mcs/,My Advice and Tips For Newcomers to MCS,"Hello everyone! I am creating this post since I am 5 years into my chemical sensitivity journey and wanted to share my experience and recommendations to people new to this disease. These are just my recommendations based on my experience - take them with a grain of salt.  My symptoms are predominately triggered by VOC's so I have no idea if these apply to people with mold sensitivity (mold does nothing to me). Without further ado, here they are:

* If your symptoms are predominantly allergy-like (e.g. rashes and sneezing), your condition might be MCAS. Take a look on the MCAS subreddit for treatment recommendations. You can try a cromolyn sodium nasal spray on Amazon to help with diagnosis. If cromolyn sodium nasal spray and antihistamines severely help with symptoms, you likely have MCAS and should seek treatment targeted for that condition.
* If your symptoms are primarily neurological (brain fog, pins and needles, muscle twitching, nausea, anxiety/unease), you probably have more traditional MCS which the medical community still doesn't fully understand and is hotly debated. MCAS treatments will likely not help in this case. I spoke with a Neurologist and he simply stated that our nerves have just become overly reactive to certain smells and there is not much you can do.
* If you have MCS, accept that you likely have this condition and your world has changed. It really really sucks. The suck is multiplied by the fact that we can't control the smells around us AND most people won't believe your condition given it isn't accepted by the broader medical community. But the sooner you accept your condition, the sooner you will take the required steps to minimize symptoms.
* The best treatment is avoidance. If there was a cure, it would have been stickied at the top of this subreddit. Given your MCS is probably going nowhere, get rid of all the scented products you own. Change to unscented soap, shampoo, deodorant, free and clear detergent, and unscented dishwasher detergent. Even with unscented dishwasher detergent, I still have to run my dishwasher when I am not in my apartment (I press run right as I am leaving). Do not use dryer sheets, even unscented sheets can be triggering and a little static in your laundry is perfectly fine.
* If your trigger is VOC's then standard air masks will not work very well since N95 masks filter out particulates, not gases/vapors. You will need a respirator to actually filter out VOC's. See [example](https://www.amazon.com/3M-NIOSH-APPROVED-Professional-Lightweight-Thermoplastic/dp/B0009F5KDS/ref=sr_1_6?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.AlOcIxpQhxKeQ18InGn_qeutJALK7VYK_E4kQnWmWZLSbV0c9WxiDbav_Dimy0yAIIwklnmnlYu-CW_5kOjd3VrOIiGDnl3eOmFDShjWqVrXu2vzorC_BoTKFqCjKCR16yvyH3QnQ2FixOyL58BkMKspwPKE2RMv4HHkRwo9lmdIu6Ht-AbNyiYf119Rpc5vWeIWqU2B_EGFwDw7xik3CwXTzv9cudc4VCrFwDYpNxMK5AribxuStAdj9-SMBsokV5APYalqVU8xYSpSl6pECmgFCxRveCYKWoZfK8JA1m8.-GXF7hztOtMm49A2BLnc9ThXqNVb4-G3_WYjNnIO2FE&dib_tag=se&hvadid=598803669801&hvdev=c&hvexpln=0&hvlocphy=9199181&hvnetw=g&hvocijid=11036610432462710655--&hvqmt=e&hvrand=11036610432462710655&hvtargid=kwd-91935539&hydadcr=2050_13503871&keywords=3m+respirators&mcid=f64c00bfd5693b188d1cd68466593363&qid=1763221886&sr=8-6). I generally do not go this route and instead practice avoidance.
* A large activated carbon air filter is needed if you plan on using a filter to filter out your apartment. However, I found that air filters do not work fast enough if you are actively introducing a VOC into the air (e.g. running the laundry, running a gas oven, lighting a candle, etc.). But an air filter could be useful if your apartment is slowly outgassing (maybe from a rug or new paint) at a rate that the filter can actually remove. If you have smells being introduced by a neighbor, it is doubtful that the filter can remove them before you get triggered (just my experience). I got rid of my Austin Air filter because I found an apartment without triggers and the Austin Air was significantly less effective than just leaving my apartment when I run the dishwasher.
* If you are getting triggered by your own apartment, cancel your lease and find a safe space. This sucks but you have to accept that you have a disease and that life will be more expensive and harder than the rest of the population. With that being said, once you find a house or apartment where you are safe, you will be much happier. There are many days I forget I have this condition given my apartment is clean. I can also tolerate short exposures when at work or in public given my total exposure load is low because I have a safe apartment. Ideally find an apartment with the following:
   * In-unit laundry systems that have independent exhausts for each tenant (shared exhaust is a no-go)
   * Electric stove and oven. I can tolerate a little gas from the stove but running the oven is a bit much for me.
   * Avoid open flame heaters (most wall heaters are like this). I currently have to use an electric portable heater in the winter but fortunately it doesn't get too cold where I live
* For me personally, coffee and stress/cortisol makes symptoms worse, but dropping coffee or being stress free will not cure MCS.
* I have tried most treatments/supplements and they did not help. I am an engineer/scientist so I have fun reading journal articles related to the condition and experimenting with medications. I did find that SSRI's and pain treatment medication helped a little bit, but the side effects of the drugs were not worth the small benefit in symptom reduction. I plan on trying LDN next when I have some time given some positive experiences on this sub. Examples of some treatments I have tried include:
   * MCAS Treatments
      * Cromolyn Sodium Nasal Spray and liquids
      * Claritin/Zyrtec/Allegra
      * Quercetin
   * Supplements
      * CoQ12
      * Vitamin B12 and Vitamin B complex vitamin
      * Vitamin D
      * All types of Magnesium
   * Pain Treatments
      * Amitrypliene
      * Sertraline
      * Cymbalta
   * Random
      * Propranolol
* To test if a treatment is working for me, I light an unscented candle. It will take 20-30 minutes for the melted wax pool to form and start releasing VOC's so this will allow me to forget about the test and remove the variable of me being able to actually smell the trigger (since the candle is unscented). Unfortunately, I always start feeling symptoms 20-30 minutes after lighting the candle regardless of all treatments I have tried.
* I have tried DNRS for a week and felt like it was not working. I feel like those types of treatment programs will help you if you have panic attacks which are triggered by your MCS. Because I don't have panic attacks when I experience my triggering smells, I did not find the program useful. Some people have found Gupta and DNRS helpful so I will not trash on them too much.

I hope you found something in here interesting or useful! But most importantly, I want you all to know that you aren't alone in this battle.

It’s been like 4 months since then.
As of recently we’ve been momentarily “living together”, i still have my own place and him as well but he asked if i could stay w him for a week.
Anyway,
Last night i planned a very cute date, made a home cooked dinner, set up like a charcuterie board, got wine, made everything really romantic and cute.
We went to bed really early like 8:30-9PM, he slept first…no sex?! (Weird but okay)
Then he wakes up like in the middle of the night and immediately hops on a game w “the boys” and plays till like 2:30-3:00 am.
Wtvr, didn’t bother me as long as he wasn’t loud.
Now it’s 11 am, i’ve been up since 6, kinda just running  around doing errands wtvr i get back and i brought breakfast.
Coffee the way he likes it
Bagels cause those are his favorite and even ask them to put extra steak and caramelized onions! 
I see he’s still in bed which okay yeah i get it’s the weekend.
So i gently open one of the blinds to let some light in, and lightly wake him up saying i brought him so coffee.
He opens his eyes like immediately and was like that sounds delicious.
And goes right back to bed, then i tell him i brought him a steak egg and cheese bagel with extra steak and… well you get it…breakfast.
Doesn’t wake up and the only line he has to say is “i’m tired”.

A part of me is pissed off cause it’s 11am already, and i wanted him to eat it warm.
At this point I’m pissed.
Like is this what they call trying to hard?
I mean shit i could just grab this fucking meal and fucking yeet it out the fucking 6th story apartment.
Shit a part of me wants to put it in the trash can hanging out so he can see and just leave back to my apartment. But then i’m the unhinged one…which i don’t really care cause im spanish so i was born unhinged but still.
Any advice on what my next steps should be, or like advice on how to deal with this? Like if we officially moved in together is this how it’s ALWAYS gonna be? Like is there no way to change this terrible habit of his?

BIO

Meet Scout

Scout is a 5-month-old pup who tends to be on the shy side and prefers a calm, relaxed approach to life. From our volunteer observations, he seems to get along well with other gentle dogs and appears comfortable with a mellow roommate. Scout may need some time to build confidence, but he's polite and easygoing once he settles in. Come meet Scout today!



Volunteer Observations:

09/19: Timid; Calm and Relaxed Body, Neutral, Good Manners

Social (Dogs); Disinterested in Pets/ Cuddles; Disinterested in Attention, Avoiding Eye Contact. Scout lays in bed does not really approach or makes too much eye contact, gets along great with his roommate.

11/02: Avoidant/Fearful, Avoiding Eye Contact

11/02: Timid, Social (Dogs), Warms Up; Wants to Play. Scout is a very shy puppy. He has timid in his kennel that allows you to pick up as he’s not quite ready to walk. When we got outside, he did sit in the corner. However, when we brought another puppy outside, he absolutely lit up. He was definitely a different dog having another dog with him. With time I think he will gain confidence being around people.



Shelter Observation:

09/18: shy walked away when opening kennel door tail not wagging in corner accepts treats



Playgroup Observation:

10/22: Tolerant, not quite confident in the yard, allows greetings and does well with other gentle dogs.



Daycation Notes: 

11/02: How did your dog do in the car? Eh, I tolerate riding in the car

Which of the following activities did the dog enjoy? Lounging around a dog-friendly coffee shop / restaurant / bar, being held and enjoyed seeing other dogs around

How did they interact with strangers? I take some time to warm up to new people

If they saw any cats, how did they react? None

If they saw any other dogs, how did they react? Solicited some dogs, and felt comfort around them, but indifferent to others

If they met any children, how did they react? Shy and indifferent to children

How did I walk on the leash? (Examples: excited/pulling/timid/awesome walker) Did not want to walk wanted to be carried or held. Would hide under chair, bench, or in bush. Rode around fine in a shopping cart.

How were my manners and do I know any tricks? Good manners, shy but enjoyed being pet and held

Did they show any of the additional behaviors listed below? Warms up (timid at first), Solicits pets, like to be held and carried

The best part of my Daycation was when.......Got to bask in the sun and eat treats

Any additional notes you would like to include about the dog? Very sweet and shy felt more secure after a while lounging around a coffee shop

1oxvb1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningToBecome/comments/1oxvb1o/how_to_make_real_friends_when_everyone_feels_fake/,how to make real friends when everyone feels fake: a no-BS guide that actually works,"You ever look around and think, “Why does it feel like everyone’s just pretending to be close?” One of the weirdest parts of adult life is realizing how *many* people you know on Instagram but how *few* of them you'd actually call at 2AM when everything’s falling apart. Real friendship feels rare. And even when you *try* to open up, it can feel like you’re doing too much. Or worse: nobody else is willing to meet you halfway.

This isn’t just your imagination. Research backs it up. We’re in what psychologists now call a “friendship recession.” According to a 2021 report from the Survey Center on American Life, the number of close friends Americans have has *plummeted* over the past 30 years. Men especially have been hit hard. But it’s everyone.

And if you’ve seen the #BestiesWithIssues TikToks that make friendship look like a quirky brunch montage…yeah, no. A lot of that energy is performative. Real friendship? Requires time, vulnerability, and actual effort. The good news is, it’s not about being naturally charismatic or extroverted. There are *real skills* you can learn to build deeper connections.

Pulled from the best research-backed books (like **""Platonic"" by Dr. Marisa G. Franco**), behavioral science podcasts, and even military psychology (yes, really), here’s a legit blueprint that works in a world full of surface-level small talk.

* **Stop waiting for the world to initiate. Science says initiation is the rarest skill, but the most powerful one.**
   * In her book *Platonic*, Dr. Franco explains that most people think “nobody likes me,” when in reality, *most people are just scared to initiate*. It’s called **the liking gap**—you think people like you less than they actually do.
   * Take the risk to DM first, plan the hangout, or follow up after you meet someone cool. Most friendships don’t happen because no one sends the second text.
   * Even better: practice what behavioral scientist **Dr. Vanessa Bohns** calls “the underestimation of compliance.” People are more willing to say yes than we think. Ask them to coffee. Ask them to go for a walk. Just ask.

* **Friendship is built through *repeated exposure* and shared vulnerability. Not just “vibes.”**
   * The **mere exposure effect**, first studied by psychologist Robert Zajonc, found that people tend to like each other more the more often they see each other. Familiar ≠ boring. Familiar = connection.
   * This is why proximity matters. Join a recurring group (like a rec sports team, pottery class, weekly co-working group). You don’t need instant chemistry. You need consistency.
   * But exposure alone isn’t enough. What accelerates trust is *emotional self-disclosure*—just being a little more real than expected. Try the “openness escalator”: start a little vulnerable, then *match the level of realness they give you back*.

* **Don’t confuse performance with presence. Learn how to *listen* like a real friend.**
   * Most people “listen to reply,” not “listen to understand.” Use a trick from therapist Lori Gottlieb (from her podcast *Dear Therapists*). She suggests asking: *“What’s the part of that that was hardest for you?”*
   * Active listening builds emotional safety fast. Repeat back what you heard them say. Validate their emotion. That’s it. Real friends don’t fix your life. They *see* you in it.
   * Bonus: Avoid one-upping or jumping into *“Oh that happened to me too…”* The fastest way to *not* be perceived as a close friend? Making it about yourself.

* **Learn the difference between social media closeness and actual social intimacy.**
   * Platforms like Instagram and TikTok create what sociologist Sherry Turkle calls ""**connected but alone**"" syndrome. You *see* people all day, but you don’t *feel* known by them.
   * Real friends don’t just heart your story. They *know what you’re going through*. Cut down passive engagement and trade it for active communication. Try voice memos, video calls, or good old texting with depth.
   * Be intentional about defining those relationships. As psychologist Dr. Kelly Campbell says, ""High-quality friendships are marked by high levels of interdependence, honesty, and mutual support."" Not comments under a reel.

* **Fast-track closeness with this odd but proven psychological trick: “forced teaming.”**
   * This comes from journalist Malcolm Gladwell and military cohesion research. When two people face a shared challenge or collaborate on a project, bonds form very quickly.
   * You can recreate that with someone by:
      - Starting a project together (launch an Etsy shop, build a Sunday study group)
      - Training for something (5K, language learning, bullet journaling goals)
      - Volunteering together or attending workshops
   * The key is: shared effort + shared laughs = accelerated closeness

* **Know that meaning takes time. And friendships evolve.**
   * A study from the journal *Social Networks* (Hall, 2018) found that it takes about **50 hours** of time together to go from acquaintance to casual friend, **90 hours** to become real friends, and **200+ hours** to feel truly close.
   * That’s why quick friends often fade. Not because something went “wrong,” but because it didn’t go *deep*. Don’t panic when some friendships shift. The real ones are built, not found.

* **Recommended books and talks to level-up your friendship skills (yes, it’s a skill):**
   * *Platonic* by Dr. Marisa Franco – the science behind adult friendship and how to make friends as an introvert
   * *Lost Connections* by Johann Hari – explores the societal roots of loneliness and how connection is central to mental health
   * *Friendship* by Lydia Denworth – a deeper dive into the evolutionary and emotional benefits of close relationships
   * Esther Perel’s podcast *Where Should We Begin* – though romantic in theme, teaches you how meaningful conversations are structured
   * *Unlocking Us* by Brené Brown – tons of episodes on how shame, vulnerability, and belonging intersect

If you’ve been burned by shallow friendships or feel like you’re always the one trying harder, that makes sense. It’s tough out here. But *the skills are learnable.* Connection is not magic. It’s practice. When you learn how to build those micro-moments of trust, people will start to meet you there.

It’s not about finding the right people. It’s about becoming the kind of person *with whom real friendship feels easy*.

**Here are my rambling thoughts on the top-5**:

- **Ámbar Dominicano**: Rum and coke. This one is really well blended, good amber and spice on the drydown. I know there are other cola fragrances on the market so I'm not sure how many uniqueness points this one gets.

- **Baní**: Probably the only fragrance with a prominent coconut note that I actually love. Along with Escalado, this is a perfect tropical vacation scent.

- **Escándalo**: This guava is awesome - unique sweet tropical fruit scent. Ranked hoogher than Bani - this is Day Three's best ""freshie.""

- **Filosofía**: Top 2. Incredible spicy wood scent. Reminds me of a more complex version of Tom Ford Oud Wood + chocolate, does anyone else get that vibe? They share 2 top notes and 2 base notes.

- **La Tacita de Cafe**: Top 2. Smells like a coffee-based cocktail in the best way. Also maybe coffee stout (Double Shot for my East Coast Tree House Brewing lovers). A finalist for a reason, but similar to Amber Dominicano I'm not sure how it sticks out compared to other coffee fragrances.

**Honorable mentions**:

- **Desert Rain**: Fresh and mass appealing in my opinion, but a little boring for my tastes, especially when compared to Day Three's other offerings.

- **Midnight Rasberry**: Great scent, too expensive for my brain to accept for a full bottle, though.

- **Tres Oros**: One of the better smells I've ever smelled. Smells like the most delicious Spanidh dessert you could imagine. Performance is surprisingly lacking on this one, though, and I felt it faded really quick.

The house is pretty unique overall, and most of the scents I didn't love from them I could at least appreciate.

I work in development and we had a pretty big deadline coming up to push a ton of new features. We were adding a lot of new pages to the website and I suggested we should hire some help. Boss surprisingly said ""okay"" and that ""he knew a guy"".  Awesome. Great even. We can get this taken care of and go back to a semi relaxed work schedule. Well after a couple weeks this guy comes in and my boss introduced him as a ""css engineer"". I almost spit my coffee out. A css engineer? Really? We are trying to make the site pretty and FUNCTIONAL! Coworkers and I all had a good laugh afterwards but figured we would give the guy a chance. After all, only degenerates enjoy css. Anyway, this new guy will not stop talking about Linux. Custom this, rice that. I get it I use Linux at home. It does make it easier for some things but I'd like to think I have some awareness for professional settings. We use windows since most of our company runs on Active Directory. Not the most easiest system I know, but it's proven to work for major corporations and governments. Besides we use WSL for most of our actual development. What does this guy do? Throw an absolute tantrum to our boss about how we should be using Linux on our development machines. He has outright refused to do anything until our boss provides him with a Linux system. I thought for sure that was the guys last day. But nope I show up Monday and the guy is receiving a laptop with Linux on it from our boss. I thought to myself ""no way"". We have asked for stuff for ages and got every corporate excuse in the book and this guy gets a laptop with Linux from one tantrum. I don't know who this guy is but he better be an absolute css God for our boss to bend over backwards like that. Well right before lunch I heard commotion coming from the bosses office. Curious I walked out to check what the screaming was about. Y'all, this dude refused to work because it had Ubuntu installed. He straight up said he doesn't use Ubuntu and installed arch I'm the system. Seriously? In terms of professional operations Ubuntu makes sense with the support provided by canonical. My boss fired the guy on the spot. I don't even think he wrote a single line of css while he was here and now I've been trying to schedule stand-ups with my boss and his schedule is blocked out for the next two weeks. If that guy is such a Linux guru he could have just installed a de of his choice and moved in with life. But no he wanted it all handed to him. Anyway, I I think I am going to go have a drink now.

I've been titrating for a for a few months now and have finally found what works for me. Elvanse 50MG seems like a good balance but my issue was that it doesn't last long - if I took it at 8am, I'd feel tired by midday. So I was prescribed a top up (10MG amfexa) and this has been great and made the efficacy window til about 4-5, but no major crash, still able to work out after work and then there might be a couple of hours of feeling tired before being back to normal by about 8pm, and if anything, sleeping better than I was before taking it because my mind was less all over the place.

A couple of times though, most notably yesterday, it was very strange. Everything seemed totally normal, I didn't feel tired at 12 but I took my top anyway as I figured it was coming. I crashed hard at 4pm, no big deal really, but my god I couldn't sleep. My legs felt full of energy and restless despite my mind being exhausted. I think I finally dosed off at about 5am. I felt like I'd had a massive coffee before going to bed.

I did everything the same - ate high protein meals regularly at the same times (big breakfast before taking elvanse, smoothie mid morning, high protein meal before my top up, etc), took magnesium so there's no variables there. 

My only thing I noticed is that normally I find once the elvanse is kicking in, without oversharing too much I typically have to go ""urgently"" to the toilet once or twice. But those days I didn't, things were normal on that front. I'm wondering if maybe because my system ""flushes"" things out quickly that might be why the medicine that's supposed to be in my system up to 14 hours lasts 4/5 for me, and on those days it lasted way long. Since it is metabolised in the gut. Prescriber says it shouldn't matter though but he's always very short in his answers and feels very rushed.

Anyway, has anyone had these random off days where the meds seem way stronger/last longer when there's no explanation? Looking back I probably shouldn't have taken the amfexa, as I didn't notice the midday tiredness but figured it would come soon.",1,1763222188.0,ADHDUK,1,1.0,False

The shot always comes out smoothly with the right weight and timing, but it’s still so damn acidic that I’ve started ordering lattes instead, which kind of defeats the purpose.

After about 3 years of dealing with secondary infertility, I think we’re officially out. Beta is on Monday but I’m not hopeful at all at this point…stark negative at 8dpt. I know technically it’s still early but I just need to dump my feelings somewhere with others that understand. 

In the past few years we have done…
-3 medicated cycles (with ob/no ovulation)
-3 IUIs (no positives)
-2 ERs (0 blasts from 1st, 4 from 2nd)
-3 FETs with no implantation (double embryo transfer for the last)
-Diagnostic testing and mock cycles sprinkled throughout with no issues besides PCOS.

My emotions have been such a rollercoaster and the hormones aren’t helping. I’m devastated to think that I’ve put my body, mental health, and family through such a hard (and expensive) process with nothing to show for it except a PCOS diagnosis. Some days, I have felt so numb and at peace with whatever happens because at least we tried everything we could, right? Other days it takes everything in me to not just breakdown and cry all day.

1oxv4k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oxv4k3/i_made_a_deal_in_a_diner/,I made a deal in a diner,"Something about a greasy old diner in a small town had a way of bringing me back down to earth. Maybe it was the ambience of the sizzling food in the kitchen combined with the clatter of plates on dilapidated tables. Perhaps it was the scent of warm coffee paired with the kind of burger you could never find anywhere else. Nothing fancy or even that good. Just warm and greasy enough to be comfortable. Maybe it was childhood memories of eating with my family at places not so different from this one. Whatever it was, there I sat, wishing I could sit in this cozy little vestige of Americana forever, or at least until my life got started, cuz it seemed like I couldn’t start it on my own.

I grew up in a small town like this. I left for college, got a music degree, and found a job in retail. I’ve been trying for a few years to make music my job, specifically as a pianist. I’ve done some session work, toured with a couple local artists, but never found anything that seemed to stick, and for the most part have felt sort of lost ever since graduating. Now I was on my to a neighboring city to see about a job as a music teacher. It wasn’t exactly what I envisioned for myself. Then again what did I think I’d really be doing with a music degree? Featuring on a Taylor Swift top ten hit? Composing the soundtrack for Star Wars XXII? This though, seems like pretty realistic work for me. At least I could put my degree to good use. Still, it felt like I wasted so much time just for a measly teaching gig. I’d give about anything for a shot at something more real.

I stared out the window while I waited for my food, watching the storm clouds gather over the small town. Before long the rain started to fall. The sound of the downpour matched the sizzling in the kitchen. It was almost enough to make me nod off. I heard the bell of the door ring, followed by footsteps approaching.

“Scuse me sir,” said an upbeat voice behind me, “Mind if I sit here?”

I looked up and saw a tall lanky man. It was an odd request considering that there were plenty of seats available, although all the window seats were taken by larger crowds. I figured I’d humor him. “Feel free,” I told him. He sat across from me and picked up a menu. 

“Whaddya say?” He asked, “The burger, or the chicken fried steak?”

“I couldn’t tell you. This my first stop here. But I ordered the cheeseburger anyway.”

“The fried steak then,” he said folding the menu back up. “Oh waitress!” He called.

“Ready to order hun?” said a voice behind me, only it didn’t belong to the waitress. In fact it was the same voice as that of the man in front of me. I looked up and saw the same tall, lanky man. Only instead of the suit the man in front of me wore, he was in the waitress’s outfit. I looked the man, then at the “waitress”, then back again. The man gave his order and his double left. I stared at the man dumbfounded, gesturing behind me, my mouth not finding the words to speak. So the man spoke for me.

“I know right?” He smirked, “I really do pull off that skirt.”

I looked around the whole restaurant. My jaw fell to the floor when I saw that every patron now had the same face as the man in front of me. “Who are you?” I finally asked.

“My buddies call me Stan.” He extended a hand. “Are we buddies Martin?”

“How do you-“, I cut myself off, it wasn’t as important as my next question. “Where do you come from?”

“Down south,” he shrugged, “I’m not too popular in the Bible Belt though, so here I am.” His coffee was brought out and his took a sip of it and smiled. “I’ve been around a bit, but tell me Martin, why does no coffee compare to a diner cup with milk and sugar?”

“What do you mean down south?” I asked, almost hoping he wouldn’t answer.

“Oh Martin,” he raised an eyebrow. “Now don’t go and act all coy with me, I think you know.”

I had an idea or two of what he was implying, but even after seeing all that I had just now, I needed a little more confirmation. Or I would if I wanted to hear this psycho out. Instead I ran to the door, but when I opened it, rather than a rainy street, I saw something that will haunt my dreams and my waking hour for years to come. An endless ashen landscape. A dark haze hung low, so that I couldn’t see the sky, assuming there was one. I heard a terrible sound in the distance. Voices. It sounded like thousands of voices shrieking and weeping simultaneously. I let the glass door close. The window still showed the rainy street side. That was more confirmation than I wanted. 

“Sir, please don’t leave the restaurant until your check’s been paid,” said waitress Stan.

I walked back to my table. Stan was slicing into his fried steak. “Yep,” he said, “I say y’all folks up north complain about global warming too much. I mean I’ve lived in heat you would not believe. And I got no a/c.”

“Well what do you want with me?”

“Not a lot really. I just thought I might be able to help you out a little.”

“What with?”

“What with? What do you think dipshit? You’re on your way to interview for a prestigious position teaching the grateful youth the art of music making all for an incredibly rewarding salary I’m sure. Or maybe you want more out of life.”

“Of course I want more, and sure I’ve been floundering in my field for years, but I’m sure once I have some stability, I can find something a little more rewarding.”

“Well I’m sure a driven focused young man such as yourself will have no problem finding that big break. But then again…” He looked at the door as the bell rang again. I watched as someone that wasn’t Stan walked in. He seemed familiar somehow. He was old, probably in his eighties. The way he spoke to the server sounded so close to home. It was me. He, or I, droned on about finally being close to retiring from teaching. 

I turned back to Stan. “I know what you’re doing, but that doesn’t have to be me.”

“No of course you’re right it doesn’t. But it is certainly possible. Probable even. Once you get into a bland but comfortable rut, it can be extremely difficult to escape it. It can be difficult to even want to. Do you want to want that life, Martin?”

“No,” I relented, “I don’t. I really don’t. But that doesn’t mean I’d want to sell myself.”

Stan laughed, “Martin, Martin, Martin! That’s not what I’m asking for no, no, no!”

“Then what do you want?”

“A shard.”

“What?”

“Just that. A small shard of a soul. So small you wouldn’t even notice it’s gone.”

“And what would I get in exchange?”

“Several years. Several years of success in whatever endeavor you pursue. You want to produce the next big hit? It’s yours. Play your own songs before grand crowds? You can. Still wanna teach? You can at the most prestigious universities, instead of babysitting inattentive brats. Whatever you set your mind to, success will come.”

“At when the time is up, what then? Back to retail?”

“Not necessarily. Your fate is entirely in your hands after that. Maybe you’ll be able to maintain your fortune, or achieve even greater heights, who knows Martin?”

“All that just for a shard of myself?”

“So minute you’d never miss it.”

I thought about it. But not for long. After all, maybe I could make it in the limelight. If not, at least I’ll have gotten a taste of it. That’ll be enough for me.

“Okay,” I said. “I’ll take it.”

Stan smiled widely. “Well then, there’s only one thing left to do.”

He grabbed a knife and gestured toward my hand. I opened it to him. I expected a slice at my palm, but he only pricked my index finger. He let a single drop of my blood fall into his hands.

“Well Martin,” he began as he stood up, “It’s been a pleasure doing business with you.” He moved to the door and said one more thing before he left, “If you’re ever in need of assistance again, I’ll be sure to drop by.”

He left. The real waitress returned with my order. It was odd, having the most bizarre experience of my life, then biting into a very ordinary burger at a very ordinary diner. Why’d I even choose to eat at a dusty old diner anyway?",1,1763222067.0,nosleep,0,0.99,False

1oxv3ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oxv3ep/my_parents_are_why_i_am_still_single_at_25/,My parents are why I am still single at 25,"I (25f) have never had a romantic relationship, never kissed anyone, never even held hands romantically.

I grew up with parents that should have divorced way sooner. Probably shouldn't even have gotten kids in the first place. They were 2 years into the relationship when they had my sister and me 2.5 years later.

I don't remember what it was like when I was very young but ever since I can remember, they were fighting. Fighting over little things, unnecessary stuff to cover what was really behind all of it: they were unhappy with each other. There is no romantic love between them anymore; I truly believe they only stay married because they are used to it now and fear starting over at 60+.

My mother used to have an adventurous life: lived in Koratia for a couple years, went deep sea diving, even went paragliding. My father is nothing like the guys she went put with before him but he was reliable and earned good money which my mother, who despite enjoying quite dangerous hobbies, cared a lot about safety, security and finances. My father offered just that and seemed to be a gentleman. But my mother made clear: she does not want a husband who doesn't take care of himself, only watches football and doesn't want to do anything.

Well, 25+ years forward he is exactly that. Don't get me wrong: I love my dad, he is supportive of me and my sister and he does a lot for the family. But besides going out for coffee or meeting some friends from work once a week he does nothing. He is also a master of weaponized incompetence and often does things half-heartedly. It gets to my nerves as well. And whenever you call him out on his BS he gets angry and punishes you with the silent treatment.

My mother isn't better tbh. She is extremely focused on money in everything, wants to be right all the time and also doesn't like when things don't go her way. She played a big part in me going to therapy.

Seeing them and how their relationship has always been destroyed by miscommunication, fighting, not truly caring and loving each other made me fearful of having a relationship. What if I end up with a man like my father who can't properly communicate and does not bother to properly clean up after himself and who can't even take a pinch of criticism? What if I become like my mother and criticise every bit I dislike and don't accept other opinions?

My sister is in a happy relationship now and does a lot of cool stuff with her boyfriend which I really like and hope that they will stay together for long. She has found someone who I beliebe truly loves her and knows how lucky he is to have her just like she knows with him. I envy her for being able to open up to someone.

To me it's scary. Not just because of my parents but because I have some deep issues with myself and my body image. I can't even imagine myself in a relationship next to the fact that I fear ending up in one that's like my parents'. I habe tried online dating but hated how superficial it was and also how superficial it made me. So while I envy my sister, I also fear romantic relationships. I am also a huge feminist (literally wrote my Bachelor's on that topic) and I feel like this also raised my standards to quite and unrealistic height lol.

25 years old now and still single. Sometimes I feel like I want a relationship but the next minute I think it's best for me to stay single.

1oxv1rf,https://i.redd.it/za6a8b3wzf1g1.jpeg,Game of Spades No Limit. My final thoughts after about a month of wearing it...,"I have had this one for about a month now and I feel like I finally understand it. The opening comes in with that herbal citrus mix from the rosemary and mandarin. At first it feels sharp and bright, but it settles fast. Once it moves into the heart, the whole scent becomes warm, creamy, and a little sweet with the coffee, coconut, milk chocolate, iris, and amyris. That part has been the part that grew on me the most. It has a smooth elegance to it without turning into a sugar bomb.

The base brings in the oud and tonka which gives it a smoky, slightly dark finish. That final dry down is where this fragrance shines for me. It has depth and character without going heavy or muddy.

Performance has been decent. I get moderate projection for the first couple hours and about six to seven hours on skin. Not a powerhouse but strong enough for people around you to notice. It sits closer after a while and becomes more of a warm personal scent, which works fine with the style of the fragrance.

After a full month of wearing it on and off, I can say this has turned into a smooth and confident scent for me. Warm, classy, and easy to wear when I want something with a little depth. Not loud, not too sweet, just a balanced blend that keeps pulling me back.

If you want something modern with a creamy woody sweetness and a touch of herbal freshness, this one is worth trying.",4,1763221872.0,ScentHeads,0,1.0,False

1oxuyyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Straight-Resolve-527/comments/1oxuyyp/quietly/,Quietly.,"In the early morning I sit. Pondering the last few weeks of my life. Taking time to reflect and enjoy simple pleasures again. Warm coffee, the breeze on my face, and long walks in the rain. I got soaked yesterday. It was rather nice. I cleared space in my mind again. A fresh start maybe? A new chapter to the story that is this life. 

I have once again returned to being myself again. The mindless self indulgent me. The one who sits back and lets life pass by, as I idly watch. Choosing when to interact. Carefully, I’ll sit by and watch the moments flash by like frames in a movie. While I enjoy my own company and have done so for a while now. 

I wonder if this is truly just it? The thoughts of everything still in my mind. I’m still here, even though I took another lashing. But it’s the life I’m accustom too. No friends to hang with, just strangers here and there. Maybe a chat or two? Maybe I’ll recluse again and come back in a few years time. I’ve been there before. Not longer welcome at anyone’s door. Had I stayed I wonder if I should have just come and knocked? Would you meet me in silence? Or open the door, glancing with a come hither stare? On a bench I sat and stayed. Breakfast in hand talking the early morning away. 

The things I do, places I’ve seen have left me wondering is this just another dream? What will the day have in store for me? Should I go see? I’m afraid to look, cause right now it feels like you no longer know me. 

Have you moved on? Have I? Who knows. I’m still not sure where this path goes. I think at this point I have given up hope. Patience has been lost this time. I hope for the day I can find some peace to my mind and my soul. Something says stay, but how am I to know? 

Of all the people I missed it was you the most. When my phone turned on. Your notification was the one I had hoped for the most. But it wasn’t there. Just a blank screen watching back. My reflection looking at me. Off to the beach I went, wind 20 miles an hour, sand in my face. Maybe I’ll just stay here, and give up the chase. 

But all of that for what? Feels like a crime to come this far and just give up. Maybe the new day with bring some clarity. ",1,1763221688.0,u_Straight-Resolve-527,0,1.0,False

I have a Philips 1220 that I got for free on FB marketplace (shout out to y'all for helping me figure out how to find the model number). 

I just finished a deep clean of the machine: took out the brew group, rinsed and brushed it with a toothbrush; took out any dishwasher safe parts and washed them; hand washed anything else removable; vacuumed up loose grounds. 

I now want to do a descale, coffee oil remover tablet, and then grease it. Is this the correct order for maintenance? 

I'm assuming it likely was never maintained before, so I figure I'd just do everything now to make sure it is clean. 

Also, once I start descale, do I need to do anything? It says not to interrupt the process but can I just run it and leave it, checking to make sure the bowl doesn't overflow?

We usually do proper backcountry camping - hauling everything on our backs for hours before we even set up. This time I borrowed my neighbor's ATV trailer since he wasn't using it and figured why not try something different. We loaded up tents, coolers, firewood, full cooking equipment - stuff we'd normally leave behind to save weight and got to the campsite in one trip instead of spending half the day doing multiple shuttle runs with backpacks killing our shoulders.

Set up camp with our full kitchen setup, proper chairs, even brought extra blankets because we actually had the space. My mate who usually spends the entire first day complaining about his back was quiet and relaxed for once. We had coffee brewing in a pot instead of instant packets. Felt almost luxurious compared to our usual stripped-down setup.

The only issue came on day two when it rained and the ground turned to mud. Getting the ATV out when we packed up took more effort than expected, but nothing we couldn't handle. We just had to pick our route carefully on the way back.

Now we're already planning the next trip and debating what else we can justify bringing. Been browsing ATV accessories online, even looked at camping suppliers on Alibaba to see what's out there which is a bit overwhelming how much gear exists once you're not limited.",0,1763221428.0,WildCampingAndHiking,0,0.33,False

1oxuq60,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeatherCoxRichardson/comments/1oxuq60/november_14_2025/,"November 14, 2025","In a transparent attempt to distract from the many times his own name appears in the documents from the Epstein estate members of the House Oversight Committee released Wednesday, President Donald J. Trump asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate Democrats whose names appeared in the documents. He singled out former president Bill Clinton, former treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers, and Reid Hoffman, who founded LinkedIn and who is a Democratic donor.

Although the attorney general is the nation’s chief law enforcement officer and is supposed to be nonpartisan in protecting the rule of law, Bondi responded that the Department of Justice “will pursue this with urgency and integrity.” Maegan Vazquez and Shayna Jacobs of the *Washington Post* note that reporters have already covered the relationship of Epstein with Clinton, Summers, and Hoffman for years, and that in July, Justice Department officials said an examination of the FBI files relating to Epstein—a different cache than Wednesday’s—“did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.”

Meidas Touch noted: “In normal times, it would be a major scandal for the President to direct his AG to criminally investigate his political opponents to deflect from his own involvement in a major scandal—and for the AG to immediately announce she is doing it. The Epstein scandal and cover up just got even bigger.”

Earlier this week, the administration cited the food delivery app DoorDash as an authority on dropping consumer prices; today the city of Chicago announced a settlement in a four-year lawsuit charging that DoorDash took advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to list restaurants without their permission and mark up food prices. DoorDash will pay $18 million in cash and credits to restaurants, delivery drivers, and consumers.

Trump has steadfastly and falsely maintained that foreign countries pay for tariffs. But today he signed an executive order ending tariffs on beef, coffee, bananas, cocoa, and other commodities from certain countries to lower prices after voters said they are concerned about the economy. Representative Richard Neal (D-MA), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said the administration was “putting out a fire that they started and claiming it as progress.”

Trump has seemed particularly nervous that the Supreme Court might uphold the lower courts that have declared most of his tariffs illegal, reiterating that having to pay back tariff money would be “a National Security catastrophe.” Representative Jason Crow (D-CO) reminded Really American Media that Trump has been “using tariffs to enrich himself and his family,” using them—or the threat of them—to get golf course deals in countries around the world, as well as using them to punish countries Trump believes are hurting his right-wing allies.

In contrast, Trump’s administration is rewarding his ideological allies. *Bloomberg* reported yesterday that Argentina’s leader Javier Milei appears to have received more financial support from the U.S. government than the $20 billion more widely reported. The U.S. withdrew $870 million from its account at the International Monetary Fund shortly before a similar sum appeared in Argentina’s IMF fund just in time for that country to pay an $840 million debt. It is, one redditor noted, “turning into a scandal.”

News broke today that the Department of Justice is in talks with Trump’s former national security advisor Michael Flynn to settle his $50 million claim against the government for damages related to the investigation into his conversations with a Russian operative before Trump took office. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, and Trump later pardoned him. A federal judge dismissed Flynn’s lawsuit and the Biden administration fought it, but now the Trump administration appears to have engaged with Flynn over it.

Last week, Flynn suggested he might run for president in 2028 to keep the MAGA movement going.

Justin Elliott, Joshua Kaplan, and Alex Mierjeski of ProPublica reported today that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s $220 million ad campaign, which she says is a crucial tool to stop undocumented immigration, has funneled $143 million to a company in Delaware called Safe America Media. The company lists the Virginia home of a Republican operative, Michael McElwain, as its address and was created days before contracts awarded to it were finalized.

One of the subcontractors who fulfilled a Safe America Media contract was the Strategy Group, whose chief executive officer, Ben Yoho, is married to Noem’s chief spokesperson at the Department of Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin. Noem’s top advisor, Corey Lewandowski, who introduced Noem to Yoho, has done significant work for the Strategy Group, and Noem used the Strategy Group for her 2022 campaign for South Dakota governor. Subcontractors are not listed in federal contracting databases.

The Department of Homeland Security skipped the normal competitive bidding process for its ad campaign, citing the need for “critical communications to the public” to go out quickly. Charles Tiefer, a former member of the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan and an expert on federal contract law, told Elliott, Kaplan, and Mierjeski, “It’s corrupt, is the word,” suggesting Noem was hiding her friends as subcontractors. He called for an investigation by the House Oversight Committee and the Homeland Security inspector general. That inspector general, Trump loyalist Joseph Cuffari, survived the January 2025 purge of inspectors general.

In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said career officials run its contracting and do it “by the book.”

William Turton and Christopher Bing of ProPublica reported today that FBI Director Kash Patel waived the standard polygraph exams required to obtain top security clearances for Deputy Director Dan Bongino and two other senior FBI staff members. The exam includes questions about foreign contacts, drug use, whether someone has a criminal history, and mishandling of classified information.

Like Patel himself, former right-wing podcaster Bongino had no prior experience at the FBI. The deputy director has access to the President’s Daily Brief (PDB), which includes some of the nation’s most closely guarded secrets, including information from the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency.

Government officials told Turton and Bing that ascending to the FBI’s second-highest-ranking official without passing a standard background check is unprecedented.

A forthcoming book by reporter Olivia Nuzzi, about which the *New York Times* reported today, says that Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a recovering heroin addict with whom she had a relationship, told her he uses psychedelics, despite claiming to have stopped using drugs decades ago.

Tonight Trump turned against those Republicans who voted in favor of the release of the Epstein files compiled by the FBI during its investigation of the sex offender. He announced he was “withdrawing my support and Endorsement of ‘Congresswoman’ Marjorie Taylor Greene,” and went after Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY), who introduced the discharge petition, calling him a “LOSER!”

Greene responded that Trump was “coming after me hard to make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next weeks vote to release the Epstein files. It’s astonishing really how hard he’s fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level…. I have supported President Trump with too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him. But I don’t worship or serve Donald Trump.”

Tonight Aaron Rupar of *Public Notice* wrote: “I just don’t see how we can pretend even for a moment that anything involving our federal government is remotely normal when the president is covering up his involvement in a child sex trafficking ring. Like, what are we doing here\[?\]”

Josh Marshall of *Talking Points Memo* (which was 25 years old yesterday—congratulations, Josh and the TPM folks!) wrote: “Investigate whoever he wants. Trumps drowning on every front.”

1oxuo8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1oxuo8i/my_story_hope_it_helps/,my story (hope it helps),"My PVC's started suddenly in September 2022. I was 28. Male (still am) Healthy, ate extremely well, zero junk, extra vitamins, and worked out 4/5 times a week, was married and living fairly simple life. However I was a **BIG** drinker (UK based) 

I was eating dinner, usual time, say 7pm, finished, then bang! Had no idea what they were. Would be every 10/12/15 beats. Hard beat followed by a pause, blood rush to the stomach and very slightly light-headed. It went on for 7 days, but **only** after a big meal, typically dinner. It would last around an hour then subside. So I assumed it had to be related to my stomach (although at the time I knew nothing about any of this or how the body worked ect). never the less very scary. I knew they had to be stomach related as I would occasionally have a hungover breakfast of 3 espressos, a brandy, and 3 cigarettes and wouldn't have 1 PVC but as soon as I ATE they would go crazy. 

  
I went doctors, they palmed me off and said I'd be fine. 

  
It kept happening, although with the occasional day without them. Then, it started to creep in after lunch, then eventually breakfast. But, thankfully, would only last between 30/45/60 minutes, then subside. but still, every meal was followed by pretty awful PVC's. 

  
I went back to doctors, again and again, got given Propanalol 20mg, which DID work quite well, and I started taking around 20/40mg before I would eat, say around 30 mins before. It helped. But after a while it stopped working. I carried on taking them anyway, as a psychological boost. 

  
Fast forward a few months. Got worse, did the monitor, scan you know the story. Everything came back clear. blah blah blah. 

  
They stayed at a steady level for another year and a half. 

  
I had a bad breakup and drank a lot, got real sick with recurring tonsilitus, moved home to my parents, got super healthy, drank maybe once a week, quit smoking, ate well, slept well. STILL HAD PVC's. At this point they became not just when I ate, but when I'd move, say get out of bed. Walk down the stairs.  Jump onto my bike. Bend over. Work out. Have a hot bath. Sat watching TV. It was a real nightmare. 

  
One day in April 2024. They stopped. I had just seen a top cardiologist in London. he had no words for me. said I was healthy, although colesteral was a little high. It was about a day or two before that that they completely stopped. I didn't have one for 5 months.

  
I went on a real bender that summer, last year, having been newly single, I was at a lot of festivals, partying, birthdays, the rest. They started to creep back in but only in the mornings as I was waking up. It didnt bother me though, I knew it was just my lifestyle that was causing it, plus it was only say, 50/60 of them as I was waking and getting ready for my day over about 30 minutes in the morning then they would go. Nothing after food. 

 I vowed to myself to sort my life out and stop their return, obviously I didnt, and by mid-september / October 2024 they were back. But I must say, never as consistently as they were for the first year and a half. Just when I was badly hungover, tired, mal-nutritioned or very stressed. they became a part of my life and I began to just accept them as a forever thing that might go away unless I ascend into god-like-tier peak physical and mental health forever, and I knew that would never happen. 

  
The past 3 months for me (aug, sep, oct 2025) were crazy, a lot of weddings, parties, moving house, fun at work, freelance jobs (photographer). They have been UNBEARABLE. I dont have more than 30 mins a day without them. As I go to bed, as I wake up, working out, after eating STILL the worst. After coffee, after a cigarette, after a couple beers, after drinking something gassy. Eating something greasy. Not eating enough. Too much water, not enough water. I mean ANYTHING causes them. My BETA blockers do NOTHING. 

  
I take extra potassium, magnesium, taurine, D, B12, C. They helped a **tiny bit** but overall its like 5/10% reduction with those added. 

  
I have weeks without booze, cigarettes, coffee, sleeping 8/9/10 hours a day. Im so LOW STRESS for my age its unbelievable. They are out of control. I've given up. My heart is starting to hurt now as well, not terribly, but im getting a lot of mild stabbing pains all day long. Im convinced im going to drop dead. 

Deffo vagus nerve linked. but again, ive tried everything and never figured out why they went away for that 5 months last year. 

Hoping they will go away again. Who knows. It's awful, feel for all of you. 

The last thing I'll say is that they **definitely get worse with GERD/REFLUX!** 

**Taking esomeprazole for me will help more than any beta-blocker.** 

Anyway, good luck.

1oxuo79,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Mr_Rellim/comments/1oxuo79/ten_thousand_review_field_tee_tactical_utility/,"Ten Thousand Review — Field Tee, Tactical Utility Pant, CO14 Insulated Coaches Jacket","I’ve worn a lot of “performance” apparel over the years, but [Ten Thousand](https://go.shopmy.us/p-31187576) continues to be one of the few brands that actually gets the details right. Clean design, dialed fits, no gimmicks, just gear built to work. Here’s my honest take after wearing all three pieces in real life, not just for a try-on session.

# Field Tee

The [Field Tee](https://go.shopmy.us/p-31186929) instantly became one of my everyday staples. It’s the rare shirt that’s lightweight without feeling thin, fitted without feeling tight, and durable enough to hold its shape after multiple washes. The fabric has that slightly structured feel you want in a premium tee, not clingy, not overly drapey

Whether I’m running errands, lifting, or heading out for the day, this is exactly what I want a “daily driver” tee to feel like. If you hate tees that get sloppy or stretch out, this one solves that problem.

# Tactical Utility Pant

[These are shockingly good](https://go.shopmy.us/p-31187019). I expected a basic tech pant, what I got feels more like the perfect blend between training pant, commuter pant, and travel pant. Lightweight, extremely mobile, and cut with just the right taper.

Pockets are actually useful (not bulky), the waistband stays put, and the fabric handles heat, long days, and movement without getting shiny or saggy. If you want a pant you can wear from a workout to a coffee shop to a flight, this is easily one of the best in that category.

# CO14 Insulated Coaches Jacket

This [jacket](https://go.shopmy.us/p-31187053) surprised me the most. It’s warm without feeling heavy, structured without being stiff, and looks like something you’d keep in your rotation for years. The insulation gives you enough warmth for early mornings or colder temps, but the silhouette still feels clean and modern, not boxy like a typical coaches jacket.

It layers well, cuts the wind, and has the kind of quality that makes it feel more premium than the price suggests. Perfect for fall, winter training sessions, or throwing on over a hoodie.

# Final Take

Ten Thousand continues to be one of the few performance brands making gear that genuinely holds up — in fit, function, and durability. All three of these pieces are now part of my weekly rotation for different reasons, and if you’ve been on the fence, this is the kind of gear that’ll make you a fan of the brand long-term.",1,1763220956.0,u_Mr_Rellim,0,1.0,False

1oxumnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessionsReal/comments/1oxumnc/i_came_inside_my_fuckbuddy_this_morning_while_my/,"I came inside my fuckbuddy this morning, while my wife thought I was taking the dog for a walk","I’ve \[36M\] been sleeping with my regular fuckbuddy, Jane \[39F\] (not her real name), on and off for about three years now. We haven’t seen much of each other for the past month or so, because she’d been away from home taking care of her elderly parents, and then managed to catch covid and this more virulent strain of flu that has been going around, one after the other. I’ve also been hooking-up with a university student \[20F\] who I met on Tinder, for just over a month now, which has also eaten into our opportunities to see one another.

Jane is about 5’4”, with short dark brown hair, hazel eyes, and a petite toned build. She has perfect little boobs (B-cups), a really nice arse, and the smoothest creamy-white skin that flushes easily when she gets turned on, and holds a handprint real nice when you spank her. She actually reminded me of the character “Nina Myers” (Sarah Clarke) when we first met; who I had a massive crush on growing up, so was instantly attracted. She’s married, no kids, and her husband works at a restaurant in the city. He normally works six nights a week, and their house is the first on their road and awkwardly positioned, so their neighbours can’t really see who’s coming and going. So, it has always been pretty easy for us to meet at their place in the evening, after her husband leaves for work.

I first met her when my daughter was going through a gymnastics phase: she was one of the instructors at the classes – working with the older kids, but still around, supervising the other instructors, and chatting with the parents – so she has met my wife as well. We always had a friendly, jokey, relationship while my daughter was attending lessons: mostly having a laugh after classes, at the expense of some of the pushier parents. There was a little flirting, but nothing too obvious and not every week. I do remember outright complimenting her arse in her leggings once, when my wife hadn’t come along to the lesson for some reason and I was feeling daring. But that was as bold as I ever got back then, and she enjoyed it at the time. She knew that I liked her, and had made a few playful comments of her own.

We didn’t hook-up until months after my daughter had stopped attending classes and had moved onto her “ballet phase”. I bumped into Jane at a bar while we were both out with friends, and got chatting while waiting to order another round. She looked absolutely stunning, dressed up for a night out, to celebrate someone’s birthday. – I still remember the slinky black dress. – And between the alcohol and her outfit, I ended up flirting way harder with her than I would have otherwise. I found her number and sent her a message the next day, asking if she and the girls had had a fun night, and apologising if I came on a little strong. Actually feeling a bit embarrassed about being so obvious with her.

She told me not to worry about it, and that she had liked being “noticed”. Which led to some more messages where we were basically openly flirting with one another: me telling her that she was impossible to miss and that all of the other dads at the gymnastics class had been smitten with her too. And her acting surprised by this and asking what we used to talk about with regard to her. Even volunteering a few (accurate) guesses of her own: nothing PG-13!

We ended the conversation friendly enough and I didn’t expect to hear from her again afterwards. Then maybe three or four weeks later I got a message while I was getting coffee. I’d been out to pick up a few things from the shops while my wife was visiting her parents with the kids. I was waiting for my order when I got Jane’s message, complimenting my butt in my jeans! And then another telling me to look over to the far corner, where she was sitting grinning at a table, alone. I went over to join her after collecting my coffee, and we ended up sitting there chatting and flirting for the better part of an hour.

She’d come into the city on the bus, so I offered her a ride home, since I was heading her way anyway and we only live a couple of miles apart. And I admit, part of me was hoping that it’d be more than just a ride home. We’d both been giving each other signals while we’d been flirting, and I had already cheated on my wife a few times by then, so didn’t have any qualms about it anymore. – I already knew that she could be discreet.

She invited me in for another coffee when we got back to her place, and told me that her husband was out with friends for the afternoon. We ended up kissing in their kitchen, and then having sex on the sofa in their backroom. I remember kneeling and eating her out, and her nearly popping my head off with her thighs when she squeezed me between them as she came. She treated me to a sloppy blowjob; surprising me with just how deep she was able to take me. And then she climbed on top of me and we fucked in a few positions.

I didn’t cum inside her that first time: pulling out and cumming on her stomach and her tits instead, as my orgasm came out of nowhere and I hadn’t asked her where she wanted me to finish. She’s never had a problem with me cumming inside her since then though. And I do remember her scooping some of my cum off her chest to taste it, and her rubbing the rest into her skin.

We lay there kissing in the afterglow, until I told her that I should probably head home. And she gave me another kiss, behind the door, as I was leaving.

She messaged me later, after my wife had got back, saying how much she’d enjoyed it and hinting at wanting to do it again. I asked her if she wanted to “get coffee” again that next weekend, and she suggested one evening after work instead – since her husband would be out. I suggested one of my gym nights, and drove over to her place to fuck her again when the time came.

“Going to the gym”, and “taking the dogs for a walk” while we meet up to fuck in the woods, or the back seat of my car, have been our go-to excuses for the last three years, and we haven’t been caught yet.

I’ve invited her over to my place a handful of times, when my wife has taken the kids with her to visit her parents, or during the school holidays when she’s gone camping with them, or to the seaside with her sister and their cousins for a few days, and I’ve had to stay behind for work. It’s harder for us to meet at my place though, since I have nosy neighbours, and quite a few of them have ring cameras. – One of them already got caught having an affair, earlier this year.

We used the “taking the dogs for a walk” excuse this morning. The weather has been pretty bad for the last couple of days, as the UK has been hit by a storm, so the dog didn’t get to go for his usual walk yesterday. I messaged Jane last night while my wife was in the shower, to see if she wanted to meet, and got up early this morning to meet her at our usual place.

We were both bundled up and wearing wellies. We took the dogs for a walk in the woods – which look beautiful at the moment, with all the autumn leaves coating the ground – and headed to one of our favourite spots. We didn’t see anyone else around, so we tied the dogs leads to one of the trees and I bent her over. I pulled her leggings and her panties down, got my cock out, and fucked her from behind, up against a tree. I had my hands up her jumper, squeezing her tits through her bra, and her arse looked so good bouncing each time I thrust into her! It was cold enough out that you could see our breath in the air, and I’m pretty sure if there \*was\* anyone around, they would have been able to hear the smacking sound of my thighs hitting her arse, ringing out through the trees!

It had been more than a week since we had last seen each other, and she was pretty desperate to cum. Her pussy was soaking wet for me right from the start, and she felt even warmer than usual – probably on account of the cold weather. She’s \*a lot\* tighter than my wife, but we know each other really well by this point, so I was able to make her cum pretty quickly while holding back myself. She was biting the back of her hand and grinding back against me as she did so. Creaming on my cock, rolling her hips, and stirring me inside her as I just stood there and let her use me.

I kept fucking her as her orgasm subsided, reaching down to play with her clit, and kissing her as we fucked. I made her cum again and then told her that I was getting close: asking where she wanted me to finish. She told me to cum in her pussy, as she would be teaching later this morning and was going to have to shower when she got home anyway. And I held onto her hips and kept pounding away at her until I came inside her. Thrusting into her, balls deep, in time with each shot.

I stood there, inside her, for a couple of minutes afterwards. Squeezing her tits and kissing her from behind. Then I pulled out and tucked myself away while she pulled her panties back up, catching my cum, and then fixed her leggings.

We finished walking the dogs and headed back to our cars. Sharing another kiss as we said goodbye and headed home.

My wife didn’t suspect a thing when I got back, and I even showed her and the kids some pictures of the woods that I’d taken this morning, to try to convince them to come with me next time. (They always say that they want to, but then never want to get up. 🙄)

I’m working up north for a couple of days next week, but should be seeing the uni student I’ve been sleeping with, after my kids’ swimming lessons on Tuesday. She asked me to fuck her without a condom and cum inside her for the first time on Monday (yes, I made sure that she’s on birth control first), and the sex has been really great the last couple of times that we’ve seen each other, so I’m really looking forward to it.

(i dumped some dirt out, they aren’t always sticking out of the soil)

b) colocasia mojito - bought a few alocasias along with this cutie, they arrived 3 days ago and are all thriving except the colocasia! obvi a week in shipping is crazy for these delicate babies but can i save it? pics are from when i planted upon arrival and today. i keep soil super moist, in my greenhouse with humidity at like 50-80%. the last leaf is like half dead, maybe a new leave will emerge?😭🤞🏼 any tips?

c) snake cutting - i am never successful with snake plant cuttings!!! this is my last one… i cut back the little bit of rot with sanitized clippers. now what?! callous over? rootinghormone? perlite? water w pothos? help

1oxujo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1oxujo8/italian_espresso_vs_american/,Italian Espresso vs American.,"Just got back from a trip to the South of Italy and fell in love with their coffee culture. 

So my main question is, how is it that a random Bar in Napoli that only charges 1 euro for an espresso and besides coffee only sells cough drops and pastries manage to have excellent espresso and a level of consistency where as in the US I just spent 4.50 plus tip for a sour, acidic espresso at a trendy roaster that has extremely high reviews? 

What are we Americans doing wrong? Besides the coffee being 100% arabica, which to me is a mistake there’s just something fundamental we’re missing. 

There’s a level of pretension that comes with high end coffee in the states that just doesn’t exist in Italy and these small, blue collar, coffee bars are serving 10/10 beverages and not overcharging, or underperforming. Is it their equipment? Their espresso machines are quite different from what I’m used to operating. I frequently saw one with a manual press.  

Anyways it makes sense the place that perfected it would do it better but I’m still a little shocked as to how much better it really is.

1oxugj8,https://i.redd.it/u9ki9eydvf1g1.jpeg,"The ultimate challenge: Finding a great gift for the guy who ""doesn't need anything.""","Okay, let's be honest, shopping for the men in our lives can be... challenging.

How many times have you heard ""I don't need anything""? So you end up defaulting to the same old socks or a coffee mug.

Here’s a little tip we’ve found: the best gift is an upgrade to their basics. Something they'll use every single day but would probably never buy for themselves.

This is exactly why we made the Aimer Men's Hiber-Sleep AlgaeWear.

Most guys we know just sleep in an old college t-shirt. But this is a real step up. The fabric is incredibly soft and lightweight, but the real magic is in the fiber and design.

Here’s what makes it so good:

🔥 Solves the ""Hot Sleeper"" Problem This is the #1 complaint we hear. The natural algae fiber is moisture-wicking, which is an absolute lifesaver. It actively pulls sweat away from the skin, helping him stay cool and dry all night long instead of waking up sticky.

☁️ Insanely Soft & Lightweight This isn't that scratchy old college tee. The fabric is just... amazingly soft. It's also super lightweight, so it doesn't feel heavy or restrictive. It’s the perfect upgrade for comfort, whether he's sleeping or just lounging.

❌ No Annoying Seams We used seamless bonding in key areas, like the shoulders. This means no seams to dig in, rub, or get annoying while he's trying to sleep. It's all designed for total comfort and easy movement.

✨ Fresh & Good for Skin This is the extra bonus. The fabric is naturally anti-bacterial and anti-mite, which just helps things feel fresh night after night. And because it's so gentle, it's also amazing for sensitive skin (no irritation).

It's the definition of a ""comfort"" gift. It’s that little bit of everyday luxury that they'll end up living in.

What's the best gift you've ever found for a ""hard to shop for"" guy? (Or, if you're a guy, what's a comfort item you'd actually love to get?)

I made the first stop with two decants of ME perfumes, and a lone designer one. Since then, I’ve only been trying out more ME, and only recently have I decided to explore more of the designer world. So here’s my amateurish take (lacking finer details) on four decants, including one ME:

1. CH Good Girl: I’ve been wanting to try this one out since forever and it lives up to its hype. It was love at first spritz. It smells smooth, sensual, feminine, and sophisticated. To my nose, it’s more of a floral symphony wrapped in a subtle vanilla note, with the coffee note completely undetectable. It’s long lasting on my skin and even more so on clothes. This one is my favourite so far.

2. Versace Bright Crystal: My first choice was Crystal Noir but since it was out of stock, I decided to settle for this. It has a fruity floral fresh scent which strangely feels nostalgic but for the life of me, I can’t remember where I’ve smelt it before. It has a screechy/sharp note to it which I can’t pinpoint.This one didn’t hit that sweet spot for me, I like it but don’t love it. Longevity is moderate.

3. Versace Eros Flame: I got this for my hubby. It has a strong citrusy spicy opening with a refined cozy undercurrent, and this one might just be my favourite of all the perfumes he’s worn so far; he’s only ever worn ME before. Longevity is moderate.

4. Rasasi Hawas OG: This smells fresh and fruity, a dna which I feel my hubby greatly enjoys. In my opinion, it’s warm weather-appropriate. Longevity is excellent.

I’ve Burberry Goddess, Prada Paradoxe, and Versace Crystal Noir currently on my wishlist. As for my hubby, I’m zeroing in on Azzaro The Most Wanted Intense. Sometimes we share our perfumes and body mists if it's not overly 'feminine' or 'masculine'. Recommendations/suggestions are most welcome. Thank you.

1oxueqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1oxueqa/not_losing_weight_even_with_massive_calorie/,Not losing weight even with massive calorie reduction,"Hey there, just looking for some shared experiences. I did the diet for 50 days back in Jan-feb and lost 33 lbs, from 238-205. It worked great and I was aligning with goals quickly.

I’ve restarted the diet for 35 days now, and have since lost 8-9 lbs, mostly of water weight. From 233-224 without much change in body size (from what I see), and in which I haven’t lost in almost 2 weeks. I’ve been eating OMAD and a coffee or two with cream, sometimes w/o, in morning. 

I gained the weight back because I got back into drinking and poor eating again. I’m wondering how I can be stagnating with such a massive calorie reduction. As an, atleast somewhat, alcoholic, I was drinking a minimum of 7-8 beers daily, and usually more. Couple with atleast 2 full meals of anything I wanted, I’d be putting away 3500 cals a day and maintaining at ~235. 

Now that I’m on sub ~2000 diet, the weight isn’t coming off at all. It’s not a body recomp because I’m not lifting at the same time. 

Is the goal to really just “eat less”, again? The mantra of “eat until full” should be applying when it’s only one meal, albeit a pretty good one but I’m still struggling to lose poundage and belly. 

Anyone else gone through stagnation? ",0,1763220315.0,carnivorediet,8,0.5,False

So Cyberhub decided to give me a Bollywood side quest today.

I was near the fountain minding my own business and fighting Gurgaon’s winter like it personally wronged me. That’s when I saw her. She walked in looking like the girl every coffee shop playlist is secretly written about. Hair flying, tote bag slipping, expression screaming “I am not even trying to pull this off.”

Her tote bag fell again and before my brain could stop my mouth, I said, “At this point your bag is trying to escape the relationship.” She stared at me for a full second, and then laughed. Not a normal laugh. A literal background music laugh. My confidence instantly went from 3 percent to 78.

We talked a bit. She told me she had an interview. I told her Cyberhub interviews are scary because even the security guards look more corporate than me. She snorted. I’m convinced this was the closest I’ll ever get to romance in real life.

Then the twist hit.

A random kid lost his balloon. The balloon floated up. The kid screamed like he just lost his family inheritance. And she? This girl literally ran after the balloon. Full slow-mo. Full drama. Full “Nike, please sponsor me.”

She caught it, returned it, and came back all out of breath, hair messy, laughing. I told her she’s basically a superhero now. She said, “Yeah but a tired one.”

Before I could ask anything useful, like her name for starters, her cab arrived. She waved, smiled, and left.

No name.
No number.
No Instagram.
Not even time for a “Hey, are you real?”

Just a cute, filmy, blink-and-you-miss-it moment at Cyberhub.

1oxu9ye,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1oxu9ye/why_just_dont_worry_about_isnt_always_good_advice/,"Why ""just don't worry about"" isn't always good advice","If you've browsed through insomnia forums, such as this subreddit, you've probably encountered posts saying that the solution to insomnia is to just let go, stop worrying, and stop trying to sleep. They will even make a point that you've tried melatonin, putting your cellphone away 30 minutes before bed, listening to relaxing music, never drinking coffee, etc., to no avail, but this advice is the thing that will truly work. Sleep requires relaxation, and you cannot relax when you are pressured to sleep. Good sleepers usually do nothing to sleep and don't think much about it, which is what makes them good sleepers, and the hyperfocus on sleep is what makes insomniacs bad sleepers.

For many people, this is the truth, and ""just let go and don't worry about it"" ends up being the advice that finally works. If this is you, great! I'm glad that works. If you've tried many things and haven't given ""just don't worry about it"" a try, it's not a bad idea to try it for a while.

But my point here is that this advice doesn't work for everyone. It is based off two assumptions, which are not always true:

1. That it is possible to choose not to worry about sleep.

2. That sleep anxiety is the one and only cause of insomnia.

\#2 is a common belief, and it really bothers me. It might be true for some insomniacs, but definitely not all of us. Personally, I have autism, ADHD, and OCD, all three conditions of which are known to make sleeping more difficult. I have had sleeping issues most of my life. As a child it took a couple hours to fall asleep, and in high school I was happy that it took ""only"" one hour to fall asleep at night. Anybody who tries telling me that the only difference between me and a good sleeper is that I try to sleep/worry about sleep and they don't is gaslighting me.

The idea that my sleeping problems are caused solely by worry about sleep, I think, has caused me more harm than good. I have had many, many nights where I managed to worry little about sleep, or not think about it at all, and still could not sleep. If the worry is the cause even on those nights, it means that my sleep system is INCREDIBLY sensitive to stress, and sleep basically cannot happen if I feel any worry whatsoever. This in turn causes me to worry about worry. I felt like the slightest worry, the slightest discomfort, when laying in bed, will easily override my ability to do this function that is so necessary for my health.

I think I am sleeping \*a little\* better after realizing that a small amount of stress will not override my ability to sleep, and I can accept stress. But I am working with a sleep therapist to improve my sleep, because I know that ignoring insomnia isn't going to make it go away (believe me, I've tried it!).

And to anyone reading this, the main point is: ""just let go and don't worry about it"" is great advice for many people, but it is not the magic solution that will work for everyone.",1,1763219994.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

So I encountered a 17.9 (relevant) year old girl sobbing outside my house about a week ago. She lives down the street, is the family scapegoat, runs away constantly, is turning 18 in like a month, and has had technology access revoked to the point she is worried about college applications. Her guardian appears to be mainly motivated by control.


I of course have now given her coffee/breakfast/a listening ear several times. I have said she can’t crash here bc I need to protect myself legally but she can use my computer/phone etc and always talk to me.

For context, I am a social worker.

Kiddo does not want to involve “the system” so a shelter isn’t gonna work. She’s just biding her time until she’s 18.

Someone I know got fired yesterday. They work in England and they worked for the specific company for 1 year.
They were asked to go have a coffee with their manager’s manager, which they agreed to thinking nothing of it. 
The manager started asking questions around how they are feeling in the role and mentioned there have been comments from people (wouldn’t say who) that stated that my friend has been lazy and cutting corners. The mentioned prior conversations about this, which my friend stated has not happened in an official manner. 
There is no written documentation regarding any formal or informal chats that my friend has received or knows about.
The manager than said that they do not fit in the current management team and if they wanted to call it mutual they could go their separate ways. 
My friend said it’s not mutual and if there is anything the could do to salvage their job, but the answer was that their mind was made up. 
So effectively they have been fired without any investigation - all was said is the company would pay their notice. 
They still haven’t received any paperwork to say their job was terminated or anything of the sort.

Is there any advice as to what my friend could do? 
They have emailed the Hr Team who said they would review in the next few days.  Thanks for your help in advance! ",0,1763219708.0,LegalAdviceUK,4,0.5,False

Homebrew Online


✨ Isekai IRL: “Truck-Kun’s Blessing” — D&D Campaign Summary ✨

Welcome to ISEKAI IRL: Truck-Kun’s Blessing, a chaotic, hilarious, and dangerously self-aware D&D campaign where your real-life stats determine who you become in a fantasy world after the divine fender-bender of destiny.


---

🚛 Premise

You were just living your normal life — maybe scrolling your phone, maybe running late to work — when fate (and a speeding delivery truck) struck you down. Instead of ending, your story begins anew. You awaken in a world of swords, monsters, and magic… but with a catch:

Your real-world self determines everything.


---

🎲 The Twist: “You Are Your Character”

Stats = You IRL
Players roll no stats. Instead, they calculate their Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma based on real-world equivalents.

Example: Bench press 200 lbs? STR 16.

Terrible sense of direction? WIS 8.

Can talk your way out of anything? CHA 18.

Still can’t remember your Netflix password? INT 9.


Class & Background
Your class and background are based on your personality, habits, and hobbies in real life.

Gym rat → Barbarian or Monk

Theater kid → Bard

Overworked barista → Warlock (Coffee Patron)

Gamer shut-in → Wizard (of Wi-Fi)


Race is Randomized
You roll for your new fantasy body when you arrive in the world. Elf? Goblin? Slime? Dragonborn? Truck-Kun decides.



---

⚡ Campaign Tone

Genre: Fantasy comedy isekai with moments of dark absurdity.

Vibe: A mix of Konosuba, Re:Zero, and D&D 5e chaos.

Rating: PG-16 (mild dark humor, existential panic, and bad life choices).

Core Themes:

Self-awareness vs destiny

Can you survive a world built for heroes when you were an accountant?

Truck-Kun giveth, and Truck-Kun taketh away.




---

🧭 Gameplay Mechanics

Players fill out an IRL stat survey before session 0.

“Truck-Kun Modifier”: Each player rolls 1d20 on impact — determines how well (or poorly) they reincarnated.

1–5: You got isekai’d into a frog.

6–10: You woke up naked in a goblin cave.

11–15: You appear in a starter village.

16–19: You wake up in a noble’s bed (awkward).

20: The Goddess herself apologizes for Truck-Kun and grants you a blessing.


Leveling up is tied to real-life challenges the players complete between sessions (like exercising, journaling, learning something new, or social challenges).



---

🌍 The World

A satirical fantasy realm where the gods are customer service reps for reincarnated souls. The world is filled with other “transported heroes” from different realities — some became legends, others… content creators.

Alright, here’s the rundown: married guy, dad of two kiddos, and cohabitating with two fluffy doggos (one being a golden troublemaker who thinks “sit” is a suggestion). Currently soaking up the NC sunshine and loving this lovely transition into sweater weather….

Saturdays are my sweet spot…slow mornings, coffee with some tasty creamer, errands staring me in the face, and maybe firing up the grill because mmmm grilled tacos. If I end the night with a drink on the patio, fire going, pretending to reflect on my life choices…the day was a win!

I love good energy, engaging chats, that spark when a conversation just hooks you in. The kind where you read a message, smirk, and instantly think of your reply.

I play a little hockey, lift just enough to maintain my “not bad for a dad” physique, and will absolutely craft a charcuterie board that looks like I’m auditioning for the food network… before eating half of it myself. And yes, avocado toast is the key to my heart.

1oxtuku,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1oxtuku/discussion_why_emotional_intelligence_is_more/,[DISCUSSION] Why emotional intelligence is more powerful than hustle: how I stopped grinding and actually leveled up,"Let’s be real. Most of the advice we see online about “success” is just loud people screaming “Wake up at 5am” or “Grind harder.” TikTok and hustle-porn Instagram influencers would have you believe success comes down to working 20 hours a day, cutting off all your feelings, and drinking black coffee until your brain melts. But here’s the thing nobody tells you: emotional intelligence outperforms hustle in real life. Every. Single. Time.

Not just because it helps you “feel better”, but because it works. It creates deeper relationships. It improves decision-making. It makes you more likable, credible, and, honestly, smarter. And it’s not fluff. I used to be in that chronic grind mindset too — endless to-do lists with zero progress in my actual life. The switch? Learning how to regulate, reflect, and connect. Aka Emotional Intelligence (EQ). This post is a deep dive into why EQ is the real flex, backed by hardcore research, life-changing books, and some underrated apps you’ve probably never heard of.

Let’s get into it.

**1. EQ makes you smarter about yourself AND others**

High IQ with low EQ? You might win debates but lose people. Dr. Daniel Goleman, a psychologist and Harvard PhD, basically put EQ on the map. His work shows that emotional intelligence accounts for nearly 90% of what sets high performers apart from their peers at work. Not technical skill. Not book smarts. It’s self-awareness, emotional regulation, empathy, and social skill.

McKinsey’s 2021 Future of Work survey emphasized that emotional intelligence is a “core skill for the next decade,” especially in leadership roles. And in a world full of AI, it’s one of the last competitive advantages humans still have.

**2. Hustle without EQ = burnout, bad decisions, and toxic cycles**

Blind hustle leads to overwork, perfectionism, and resentment. Most people think they’re being productive when they’re just being busy. EQ helps you step back, assess what actually matters, and set boundaries. Dr. Susan David, in her book *Emotional Agility,* says “emotions are data.” Ignoring them leads to burnout and worse — stagnation masked as productivity.

Stanford researcher Emma Seppälä found that people with higher EQ scores are more resilient to stress and perform better in high-stakes environments. So yeah, you can grind less and still win more.

**3. EQ makes you better at influence and leadership**

Want better friends, partners, clients, mentors? Learn to listen. Learn to read a room. Learn to regulate your ego. The most effective leaders don’t yell. They connect. Research from TalentSmart shows that 90% of top performers have high emotional intelligence, and EQ is consistently ranked as more important than IQ for leadership roles.

**4. EQ helps you unlearn survival-mode thinking**

A lot of us operate in survival mode because we grew up in chaos, scarcity, or just constant pressure to perform. Hustle culture feeds that. The truth is, most people don’t need to work harder — they need to feel safer. When you improve your emotional intelligence, you stop reacting from fear and start responding from clarity. Your nervous system finally relaxes. That’s when your actual potential unlocks.

**5. You can train EQ. It’s not fixed. It grows.**

Unlike IQ which is largely static, EQ is learnable. It improves with practice. And when it compounds, it changes your entire life. You start understanding your triggers. You learn how to apologize better. You give better feedback. You pick better friends. It’s not therapy. It’s strategy.

Here’s the most powerful EQ resources I’ve used — apps, books, podcasts, and tools that actually made this practical:

**1. Read this book and you’ll never see emotions the same again**

*“Emotional Intelligence” by Daniel Goleman* — This is the Bible of EQ. Goleman, a Harvard-trained psychologist and former NYT science journalist, breaks down why emotional intelligence beats IQ in the real world, and how it impacts everything from school success to leadership to relationships. It’s based on decades of neuroscience and psychology. It was a NYT bestseller for over a year and sold millions worldwide.

My reaction: mind blown. It literally made me question how I’d been thinking and reacting all my life. This is the best foundational book on human behavior I’ve ever read.

**2. If you feel overwhelmed often, this book will recalibrate your brain**

*“Permission to Feel” by Dr. Marc Brackett* — He’s the founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. This book is not woo-woo. It’s based on the RULER method being used in schools and companies globally. It's practical and backed by science. It helps you label emotions correctly, identify patterns, and build emotional granularity.

This book made me stop judging myself for feeling “too much” and taught me how to use those emotions as tools.

**3. For those who hate being “too sensitive” or “too reactive”**

*“Emotional Agility” by Dr. Susan David* — She’s a psychologist at Harvard Medical School. This book was named *Best Business Book of the Year* by *Harvard Business Review*. Her TED Talk has over 10 million views. She explains how suppressing emotions actually makes things worse, and offers frameworks to navigate hard feelings with clarity.

This book hit HARD. Especially if you’re constantly questioning yourself or stuck in looping thoughts.

**4. Try to make learning addictive**

*The Mood Meter App* — based on Yale’s RULER model. This app helps you track your emotions in real time with a simple color grid. Over time, it helps you recognize patterns so you can intervene. It sounds simple, but it’s surprisingly powerful. Helps you get in the habit of checking in instead of just powering through.

**5. I recommend checking out this app called MindTools**

It’s designed for professionals who want to grow in soft skills like communication, resilience, and leadership. It includes EQ micro-courses that are short and actually interactive. Works great for building small daily habits.

**6. BeFreed**

This is an AI-powered learning app that builds a personalized growth plan based on your goals. It’s created by a team from Columbia University. It turns expert talks, top books, and psychology research into short podcast-style lessons tailored to you. You can pick how deep you want to go — 10, 20, or 40 minutes. Also, you pick your host’s voice and tone. It adapts to your behavior and builds you a whole emotional growth map.

What I love most? It actually covers all the books mentioned above and has entire collections on emotional mastery, regulation, and relationships. It made replacing doomscrolling with 10 minutes of real learning way too easy. That’s the compound power of 1% self-improvement. One year from now, you’ll be a different person without ever feeling like you were “grinding.”

**7. Check out this podcast if you want EQ that feels modern, not clinical**

*The Science of Happiness* by Greater Good Science Center at UC Berkeley — They break down emotional wellbeing, empathy, and gratitude with real research and real people. Episodes are short and digestible. Feels more like a conversation than a lecture. Great for rewiring daily habits fast.

**8. Best YouTube channel if you want practical EQ tools to use today**

*Therapy in a Nutshell* by Emma McAdam — She’s a licensed therapist and explains mental health topics through the lens of emotional regulation. Her videos on “how to calm a racing mind” or “how trauma affects emotional maturity” are gold. She makes clinical psychology super accessible. Perfect if you’re overwhelmed or stuck.

All of this to say — hustle has its place. But EQ is the true multiplier. It doesn’t just make you “nicer.” It makes you sharper, more resilient, and way more powerful. Don’t just grind. Grow with EQ.",1,1763218908.0,MotivationByDesign,0,1.0,False

I've been making coffee pour-over cones in the studio. They are pretty easy to throw, but persnickety about the precise dimensions, because they have to fit a number 4 cone filter. I thought I would share the dimensions here, as well as one that I threw.  
At leatherhard I cut a 1/4"" hole through the bottom. If you like your coffee on the strong side, you could make a smaller whole, or larger if you prefer weaker coffee.

Though different claybodies do shrink at different rates, all of the \^10 stonewares I have used have worked using the the measurements shown.  
You can handbuild these also, but it's much easier with a form to build over, so I threw & bisqued a cone shape for slab building.

**Stats:**

Average Daily Wordcount: 950

Week Total Word Count: 6,647

**Words to go:**

Month: 71,939

Year: 988,061

I just want to start off by saying that I am very glad that even though my week was busier, academic-wise, thanks to the two exams that I took this week, Wednesday and Thursday, all while not feeling that great, I still managed to get more words (but not more chapters) than last week.

But also I learned and lived the lesson of self-care being self-preservation that a classmate presented in her presentation this week.

You want to find out more? Keep reading!

**WEEK WINS**

This week:

– I WROTE ALL SEVEN DAYS THIS WEEK, SO I’M OFFICIALLY AT A TEN-DAY STREAK!

– I finished revising Act 1 of Can You Spell Werewolf, and now I’m in Act 2A, which today I’m going to knock out the rest of it today.

– Yesterday replaced November 4 (1,738) as the highest number of words I’ve written in a day for this challenge so far (1,783).

– I did actually read 2 days in a row this week—both Coldwire by Chloe Gong and The Widow by John Grisham.

**A LESSON LEARNED PUT INTO PRACTICE**

One of my classes is Academic/Personal Development, and we have to do presentations, which I mentioned that I did mine last week.

But my favorite presentation (and I’m not going to give out her name) I heard was about the importance of self-care being self-preservation in life. And I feel like that was an overarching theme this week:

Tuesday:

The lowest word count day. Not because it was the day before my two exams, but after because I got back to my dorm from my Tuesday Night Fellowship ,showered did an assignment I still needed to finish, I just went straight to my bed.

At 10:00 pm.

That. Never. Happens.

But I started getting sick on that day.

***Wednesday:***

I skipped coffee. Which is big, because Wednesday is the only day that I drink coffee because I don’t want to get addicted to caffeine.



Thursday:

The day I heard that self-care presentation.

I was allowed to go back to SMU from work early because my parents and my manager could tell that I wasn’t feeling that great. My mom said that I had the eyes of someone that didn’t feel great. And I just want to say that I’m so grateful to them.

Mom, Dad, Mrs. Erika, if you’re reading this, *thank you* so much. I needed that time off.

And even though, I *wanted* to go to a psychology talk for one of my Research Methods in Psychology Out of Experience credits.

Which I already did earlier that morning after my Spanish exam by beta-testing a video game called Fling in Hughes-Trigg (which I really wish that I had gotten that experience on camera). I wanted to get two credits.

But I had to say *no*.

Just like I said no to getting more words on Tuesday after TNF.

Just like I said no to drinking coffee and going to my community group on Wednesday.

I needed to say no.

And that’s the most important lesson that I learned this week: Sometimes you need to say *no* to something so that you can say *yes* to your well-being.

**WEEK 3 WISHES/GOALS:**

* I have two research papers one from Research Methods in Psychology and one for Intro to American Government to Politics due next week on the 23rd and 24th respectively, but my goal is to get them turned in on Friday, so that I can be done with academic work for Thanksgiving break.
* My goal is to get to the 70%-75% range of completion of Can You Spell Werewolf? and the end of Act One and the first arc of A Speller’s Genesis.
* I want to read/listen to my books all 7 days this week.
* And in the spirit of well-being, I’m going to commit to getting more different forms of exercise than usual all 7 days this week.

What about you? What did you learn this week?

What did YOU have to say no to this week to protect your well-being?

**Stats:**

Average Daily Wordcount: 950

Week Total Word Count: 6,647

**Words to go:**

Month: 71,939

Year: 988,061

I just want to start off by saying that I am very glad that even though my week was busier, academic-wise, thanks to the two exams that I took this week, Wednesday and Thursday, all while not feeling that great, I still managed to get more words (but not more chapters) than last week.

But also I learned and lived the lesson of self-care being self-preservation that a classmate presented in her presentation this week.

You want to find out more? Keep reading!

**WEEK WINS**

This week:

– I WROTE ALL SEVEN DAYS THIS WEEK, SO I’M OFFICIALLY AT A TEN-DAY STREAK!

– I finished revising Act 1 of Can You Spell Werewolf, and now I’m in Act 2A, which today I’m going to knock out the rest of it today.

– Yesterday replaced November 4 (1,738) as the highest number of words I’ve written in a day for this challenge so far (1,783).

– I did actually read 2 days in a row this week—both Coldwire by Chloe Gong and The Widow by John Grisham.

**A LESSON LEARNED PUT INTO PRACTICE**

One of my classes is Academic/Personal Development, and we have to do presentations, which I mentioned that I did mine last week.

But my favorite presentation (and I’m not going to give out her name) I heard was about the importance of self-care being self-preservation in life. And I feel like that was an overarching theme this week:

Tuesday:

The lowest word count day. Not because it was the day before my two exams, but after because I got back to my dorm from my Tuesday Night Fellowship ,showered did an assignment I still needed to finish, I just went straight to my bed.

At 10:00 pm.

That. Never. Happens.

But I started getting sick on that day.

Can men smell that I’m recently single?,"Been about 5 months since break up. I’m in no means ready to date, I barely want to conversate with anyone. I’ve had 4 different men try to talk to me. I’m up and down a lot and admittedly I gave my number to 2 of them. Thinking just try and see what happens or at minimum just getting out of the house. 

1 out of the 4 I went on a 45 min date with. We did not click that much. He barely messaged me much after, in a span of 2 months, messaged me twice and asked if we should continue talking. I said it’s best if we don’t, I’m not really looking to date. He then berated me over and over about how I’m a shit person and how dare I waste his time? wtf? Blocked

2 out of 4 met on my job site. The next time they talked to me bought me a little lunch, it was sweet, I was upfront about my situation, he said it’s ok and no pressure. When I didn’t want to hang out with him the next day he also berated me saying I need to make up my mind and he’s not putting up with this. (All in person, I just walked away)

3 out 4 saw me walking my dog everyday in my neighborhood and kept trying to talk to me. I always had headphones in and waved and kept walking. Eventually they got micro conversations and I felt cornered into chatting with them, I noticed they would walk more frequently and search for me. I have now run opposite directions and or head on a swivel.

4/4 last week, he saw me at dog park, followed me with his dogs to try and talk. He was nice we chatted. It was fine. Asked for my number. Like an idiot I said sure maybe I can have dog friends for my pup. He kept asking me to hang out with long big commitments like going to hockey games and concerts which I don’t know you, don’t feel comfortable doing something like that. If he asked for coffee or something first then maybe. Messaged me again yesterday to ask to go with him to some event. I straight up didn’t even know his name. I declined and he had the audacity to write me I don’t care for your games, let me know when you want to hang out otherwise I’m not texting you small talk. that was in a span of 3 days.

I DONT KNOW THESE PEOPLE? I am not even trying to date anyone and when I tell them no, Why do they think I owe them anything????? Am I crazy? I certainly am not giving out my number at all anymore, but 2 of them I didn’t, met “organically” or just couldn’t escape. I’m just trying to exist. I can’t even be in my own neighborhood in peace.

I have very recently become interested in perfumes, and I am trying to figure out what works out for me but I have been looking up different opinions on some perfumes I have tried yesterday and I am quite confused about a few things.

Keep in mind that I wore Tous Your Powers for the last few years, because it didn't smell like straight up alcohol (which most perfumes smelt like for me) and the smell also didn't change much on my skin.

However, I wanted to try something less sweet and more mature/sexy. 

So I have tried several perfumes but some stood out to me. 

I have tried Jean Paul Gaultier Paradise Garden, which to smelt way too strong and alcohol-ish and to make things even worse, on my skin I felt like it smelt like pee. 

I also gave a gry to Jean Paul Gaultier's Divine Elixir, which on paper smelled nice, but on my skin it nearly disappeared. 

I have also tried Black Opium, which is the one that puzzles me the most, because everyone claims it smells either like coffee or chocolate. To me it smelt straight up like an incense stick.

And even more intense on my skin. Which I actually loved and I am debating on going back to buy that one too, but my bf found it too intense. He also thinks it makes me smell like a tarot shop lol.

But I didn't find anything about anyone else with the same impressions. I genuinely do not get any whiff of coffee nor chocolate at all... It actually even made me think of the myrrh smell used at church lol.

I ended up buying Jean Paul Gaultier Le Belle, because it didn't smell like alcohol, it wasn't too sweet, it didn't turn sour like many do on me, and it also didnt lose its fragrance on my skin...

I always feel like I struggle with perfumes because they moment they touch my skin the entire fragrance disappears. 

Anyways, I guess I wanted to know if anyone can relate to any of this. And maybe help me out a bit on what direction I should go haha.",2,1763218514.0,Perfumes,5,1.0,False

I noticed that every time I tried fitting into a group of people I ended up being ""one of those people who ..."" or ""not a real..."".

 It seems that I am everything that a person shouldn't be. I don't understand how this is possible. I can't be bad at everything. Why me? In order to be exceptionally lame, I would've to have had an extraordinarily lame life, which is just not the case. So I don't understand, why most people treat me like i'm the worst person they've ever seen.

When I watch Instagram reels or listen to my sister or people on YouTube and Twitch talking about other people, the slightest detail is enough to make them the subject of ridicule and contempt. When I see lists of red flags, or reels about “those people who..."" it's always people like me... It's not even that I can't uphold myself to the standards of those red flag videos, it's that I'm far, far below them. I feel like making friends is like climbing a mountain, and I can't even climb the stairs to the first floor of my apartment building.

I feel like wherever I go, I'm always “the other”, “those people who...”, “the one you shouldn't be.”

I'm constantly questioning myself, and it's never enough. I feel like I'm inherently bad and there's nothing I can do about it. I can suppress my true nature as much as possible, but it will never be enough because others see right through my act and accuse me of being fake.

It depresses me enormously because if I am inherently bad, then there's nothing I can do about it, and I will never be able to maintain the social relationships that make life worth living. I've never had a girlfriend, I've never gone to a bar/coffee shop with friends, I've never been to an exhibition with friends, I've never gone on vacation with friends, I've never been to a club etc... I've never done any of these things and I probably never will...

I just wish things were more simple, that I didn't have to hide myself all the time. I'm not asking for a lot, just one or two hours a week where I feel like I belong somewhere, where it's okay to just be me. I know I'm not perfect and that in many respects, I suck; but does that really make it absolutely impossible to play games with me 1 hour a week, or go to a coffee shop with me? Do I really need to have a phd in sociology, litterature and philosophy and make 10k a month in order to get a girlfriend?

1oxtny9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oxtny9,Character through inventions - my backstory experiment,"Okay so, sharing a little discovery.

A few months back I realized something simple - why just TELL a character's backstory when you can SHOW it through what they actually do?

Like, I have this character Will (platypus in the pic). He's a tech genius slash procrastinator who can fix anything from space junk, but he's lazy as hell. His whole motivation is inventing stuff that does the work FOR him.

So instead of an infodump like ""here are his skills,"" I started making a series about his inventions. Each invention is a piece of his character and history.

Already released 2 episodes. Now thinking about the next ones.

**Here's my list of ideas:**

1. Micro-meteor Vacuum - sucks up everything, including whatever's in Gerard's pockets
2. Therapy Coffee Machine - serves you coffee AND a pep talk like ""stop being a vegetable, be a latte""
3. Invisible Armor - hides the whole ship but NOT the noise or the smell
4. Cyber-Alarm ""Back Off"" - won't shut up until you give yourself a full motivational speech
5. Idea Generator ""Hawk Filter"" - deletes Hawk's dumbest ideas. In theory.

What do you think? Which invention would hit the hardest?

Or maybe you have ideas for what kind of absurd thing a lazy genius would invent to automate maximum chaos?

The premise is admittedly unusual but also kind of sweet when you think about it. We correspond like we're already in that comfortable middle period of a relationship where you can be simultaneously earnest and ridiculous, where the pressure to impress has evaporated and been replaced by actual curiosity about another person. We'd write emails about nothing in particular and everything all at once. We'd exchange photos of each other only at the beginning, not because we're auditioning but because it's genuinely nice to put a face to the voice you're getting to know, and because transparency matters when you're trying to build something real, even if that something starts out as an experiment in epistolary connection.

I want to be clear about intentions here because that matters. This is about seeing if two strangers can write their way toward genuine connection, whether that becomes friendship or pen pal situation or potentially something more, and whatever unfolds would happen at whatever pace feels right to both people involved. No pressure, no weird expectations, just the space to be human together in text form and see what develops naturally.

If you're reading this and thinking ""this sounds either delightfully weird or weirdly delightful,"" then maybe you should send me a message, and we can start pretending we're already in love until one day we realize we've accidentally stopped pretending.

They aren’t human anymore. Don’t forget that. Don’t listen to it, don’t look at it, don’t think, don't even think. If you see it or get near it or sense its agents are nearby, or you start suddenly thinking about sunflowers, or feel anything out of the ordinary, close off your mind and think happy thoughts until you’re out of range. At this point I don’t know how far they have spread, but I want this warning out there while I can still give it. 

**03/03/25 – 0900 hours** 

Entry 1 

I worked at a government testing facility. I ran away, leaving my coworkers to clean up the mess. This is less of an exposé piece and more of a confessional, so the details of its location and such are irrelevant. I just pray this might abstain me of some of my sins. I’m not a religious man but I now know there are things beyond this world, or at the very least, our understanding of it, so I might as well try and cover ass. 

I also think it wants me to tell you all about it... I’m not sure. A throbbing pain permeates inside my skull, clouding my thoughts. It’s a constant pressure from within, sitting behind my eyes, travelling all the way through to the back of my head, caressing me as it fades down my spine. It’s consistency and my nebulous mind has created a constant brain fog, so forgive me if my writing is nonsensical at any point. 

I’ve seen my fair share of horrible things. To be honest, we’re not entirely ethically sound there. But it helps us all sleep at night if we think we’re doing something for the greater good at the end of the day, finding comfort in some self-imposed moral ambiguity. Yet no amount of mental gymnastics can excuse what we’ve done. 

August 17^(th), a team debrief was held to establish understanding of our next project. Bright and early in the morning my four other colleagues and I filed into the observation room, its interior white like sugar - glistening, pristine surfaces covering every square inch. We gather in the corner, beside the hissing coffee machine, in a queue waiting for our turn. A window into the world we would watch daily filled the wall opposite us. Our debriefer followed us in and stood in front of it. The window and him separated by our workstations, long tables connected and covered in computers and stationery. At first glance it hardly resembled a research lab, more akin to an interrogation room. 

Our debriefer read from a clipboard, barely able to see past the mounds of eye bags that rest between his tired gaze and his reading material, droned on about a new, experimental, “revolutionary”, form of communication, lips loose as each word fell out of his mouth. Not a single person in the room was convinced; we all just took notes and followed along begrudgingly like anyone on a Monday morning would. The debriefer looked like Monday morning incarnate. Craig, the man on my right, letting out sigh as he wrote, the woman on my left was visibly rolling her eyes. I’d worked with this team before, some members more than others, and we were no strangers to failed experiments. In fact, I used to work with Craig a lot, and at one point, I even considered him a friend. In recent years, Craig has endured a melancholic depression due to the passing of his wife years ago. Suicide. 

Suddenly, what felt like an encore of my morning alarm shook me to attention, waking me more than its predecessor. However, this alarm took the form of a mess of a professor bursting through the door, almost crashing into our desks, then steadying himself as he stood next to our debriefer. A flurry of emotions spewed from this man's demeanor, from frustration to excitement to exhaustion to... paranoia? He was a mess. Untucked shirt, titled glasses, messy hair. He had the eyes of a man lacking sleep, as well as the desire to do so. Yet his chin held so high all he could do is look down on us. As if he could grace the gods themselves. He did not have an ego or high self-esteem. His sin was the pride he had for his work. 

“This is no ordinary communication technique!” He announced, emphasizing his words with dramatic hand movements. “Listen well please. I have designed a quick procedure that alters minds. You can think of it as a form of mental walkie-talkie, if you wish to keep your view skewed, just know that it is so much more than that. They have unlocked, um-” a brief pause, lost in thought. “No, actually, I won't get into the details.” He stammered. He went on, and during his tirade our previous debriefer and this raving loon had come to a non-verbal agreement that the old debriefers' work here was done, as he handed over his clipboard and shambled out of the room.    
“All I need from you all is to follow the tests I put in your mission outlines and take extremely detailed notes.” The professor said. He walked to the door, this time much calmer and purposeful. “Telepathy people. This is telepathy.” He said over his shoulder on his way out. I now notice that the room's tone had shifted to curious and awake. He couldn’t be serious, right? Maybe he put receivers in these poor people's brains that read their thoughts and sent them to the others. Yet somehow the way he’s talking about it makes it seem worse and more complicated than that. Telepathy? This building is for science, not magic.  

All we could do as a team was share a few confused glances before our mission began. Five people, each wearing button up shirts with their allocated number, entered the room beyond the glass wall. Their new home was big enough to comfortably fit them all, full of beds, two private bathrooms in the back-end corners of the room, male and female, a dining table and chairs, and a shelf of reading material present opposite the door they came in. We were to watch these people through our one-sided window for an undisclosed amount of time. And they had “telepathy”. “Ridiculous” was the conclusion I came to. 

 

 

As I’m recounting my experiences here, I’ve realized that my head is spinning, and the sweat is starting to pool at the base of my keyboard. I wish none of this was true, I wish to return home, I wish to not know what I know. It terrifies me. Anxiety is swelling up in my throat and it's all beginning to bubble over. The room is shifting and rotating like I’m a lost sock in a broken washing machine filled with shit. My heart sinks below the floorboards of the filthy shack that I've found myself in. Even below the surface I can feel it pounding and urging me to stay alert. Eyes are on me. I’m surrounded by whispering voices that want in, but I won’t let them get to me. Bangs on the door rattle through my ear drum, piercing my skull with each thump, and I feel as though I’m going to collapse. I heave and I heave but nothing leaves me. No barf. No breath. Only desperate wheezes.  

Until it stops.  

Silence. 

Maybe this was a mistake. 

 

**03/04/25 – 1300 hours** 

Entry 2 

Whatever “procedure” the professor spoke of earlier had already taken place. All that was left was to test and observe. 

The first few days were boring and normal. They all engaged in small talk and got to know each other. A young Korean girl, maybe in her early twenties (She was labelled number 1 on her uniform), confided with a single mother from Bangladesh, she had the most caring eyes and had a strong maternal instinct (number 2). A shorter Caucasian man, (3) was telling an equally short, older uncle from Singapore (4) about his gambling troubles (the reason he’s here). The Singaporean listened intently and tried to give advice with his hands comfortably sitting behind his back. The gambler did not listen in return, only vented. A tall African American man (5) immediately inspected the collection of reading material on the shelves. He seemed quiet and was by far the most physically fit in the group. 

Their life details and anything that may be important are in our files. We were encouraged to still use their numbers, not their names. According to our records these were test subjects, not people, it’s almost barbaric. A lot of people here only saw them as such, subjects that aided in the advancement of, well, whatever the government wished to advance, I suppose. Craig was always against this. Made him furious that they “weren't even granted the basic human decency to have a name.” Even now, I can't remember their names. 

 

Test 1- 

It was simple. We ask them to briefly tell us how they’re feeling, what they’re thinking about, then to think of something specific.  

Korean girl (1) was first- 

“okay”, “home”. 

“Think of sunflowers.” Craig spoke to them through a speaker. 

Bangladesh woman (2)- 

“tired”, “my children”, again, told to think of sunflowers.  

By this point we’d forgotten the professor's speech, and the drawl of work took us over again, sifting through tests and notes as our tasks wore on. 

The gambler (3)- 

“bored”, “money,” sunflowers. 

Singaporean uncle (4)- 

“Huh? Oh! Happy"", “my new friends.” Sunflowers. 

The fit dark-skinned man (5)- 

“intrigued”, “your book collection.” Sunflowers. 

We then went on to record their brain activity, blood pressure, etc. All baseline stuff. We repeated these tests every three hours for the first day with no noteworthy results. At 2200 hours our coworker, Dylan, a gruff man and a heavy cynic, grabbed the microphone to speak to our guests.  

“Do any of you feel anything worth noting?” He grumbled past his thick beard.  

“... I’m tired of thinking about sunflowers. hahaha” the Singaporean uncle chimed.  

“Do the rest of you feel this way?” Dylan asked the room. His question was answered with shrugs and silence. After a sigh he asked “Hear any... voices? In your head that... aren’t your own?”   
He was jumping a bit forward. These tests were specifically structured. We weren’t sure how much the patients knew of what the results of the procedure were, but I knew he was not supposed to ask that. I suppose it didn’t matter as his question was once again greeted by a confused silence. “Typical.” Dylan huffed, off mic, to only himself, I suppose. He walked away and promptly clocked off for the night. Dylan would be in deep shit once this got out, the higher ups are very particular. He was prone to frustrated out bursts at tests he thought were a waste of time.    
“What do you mean “voices”?” The tall number 5 asked. We had no answer to give to our neighbors on the other side of the window, so we gave no answer. Anything outside of taking notes and tests was above our pay grade anyway, so we all began packing up and clocking out too. 

Gabriella, Craig, and I were the last to leave. Gabriella was shy and thorough with her notes, so she stayed a while to revise and observe at her station. She was deep in her files like a cave diver dislocating themselves just to enter a virgin passage, a hair tie holding back her deep brunette hair from hindering her work. She only halted every now and then to push up her thick framed glasses. I was tired and made myself another coffee on my way out, Craig joined me, though we didn’t speak, so I passed silent glances between Gabriella, the test subjects, and my feet, as if they were playing some invisible three-way tennis match. We, the lucky few, witnessed their first signs. “Stupid sunflowers.” The Korean girl, the gambler, and the Singaporean uncle moaned in unison. They looked at each other confused, as did we. They began a debate on coincidence or not. An hour of overtime note taking and observing, and the rest of us window watchers were able to head home. 

 

This was the first time they did that, spoke in unison I mean, lord knows it's not the last.  

I can still hear their synchronized groans. 

I need a drink before I think about this anymore.  

 

 

**03/06/25 – 0240 hours** 

Entry 3 

I forgot to write today (yesterday?). Forgetting feels nice. Easily achievable with the appropriate amount of pain killers and alcohol. I’ve made sure to stock my temporary motel room with said supplies and spent the day partaking in them. It doesn’t help the dizziness, but I finally feel mental quiet and physical numbness. 

I don’t know why I’m even hiding. Why I’m jumping from motel to motel. It could find me if it wants. I’m sure if anyone else from my old job was looking for me, they’d find me too.  

It just feels right. To run. It's all I can do. 

I’m sorry, Craig, if you're out there. I didn’t mean for this to happen. Any of it. 

That last look you gave me will haunt me the most. 

 

**03/06/25 – 1840 hours** 

Entry 4 

Day two of the experiment wasn’t noteworthy, except for the fact that Dylan didn’t come in. In fact, he never came in again. Who knows if he got fired or if another terrible fate befell him. We went on as usual, though. Test, watch as their food is delivered and eaten, test, watch, test. More baselines, asking them how they’re feeling, etc., etc 

In-between tests I tried to make small talk mixed with half assed attempts at humor with Craig and the rest of the crew. “Lovely day for it, huh?” knowing we’d be inside our windowless box all day, the weather not affecting us in the slightest. I don’t think they heard me, because they didn’t laugh. Gabriella buried herself in her work, the woman I didn't know the name of would give one-word answers out of politeness but clearly did not want to be spoken to (I did learn her name was Alexa though). And Craig, well, the usual, barely receiving eye contact let alone a conversation. His eyes were sunken and soulless, and he’d lost the extra weight he had around him and then some. He’s still torn up inside over what happened. Does he know it eats away at me too? I don’t know what led us to continue to work here, but here we are, the invisible hand of fate guiding us along. 

I stewed in my own anguish for most of that day. Silent crew, lack luster results, Craig, all of it was dragging me down. At the time I remember wanting nothing more than a drink, but my 2-month company mandated sobriety streak loomed over me, so a coffee would have to suffice.  

The professor snapped me out of my mental crisis with yet another unannounced intrusion.    
“After receiving your reports yesterday, I updated your work outline. I’m aware that there are cameras that are monitored, and the recordings are checked, however, I have brought up the possibility of 24-hour personnel monitoring with the higher ups, and they seem to agree.” This alone would’ve brought my blood pressure up another notch, resulting in a very good reason to break my sobriety. If it weren’t for his next sentence, that worsened things still. “So, if anything... happens, we have eyewitnesses. They called me mad, but I already know this will be a great success.” This man and his cryptic nonsense were going to send me over the edge today. 

“Are you going to explain a single thing to us? How can we do our job without the facts? Now we’re supposed to monitor them 24/7?” I hissed through clenched teeth, stress weighing on me. 

“We don’t know the details of what happened to these people or what will happen. Do they even know?” Craig announced, stepping forward. Craig was a selfless, soft man. He wasn’t even surprised about the extra hours, he just wants to help these people. Looking at him, I noticed that he’d turned pale. 

“We’re getting paid overtime for this right?” Alexa added. 

“Yes, yes. Please trust me, we will get to all that soon. In the meantime, ... Do your fucking jobs.” The Professors smiley answer turned to a spit and a snarl. On his way out, he mentioned one last thing. “You will be paid double for this of course.” 

We apparently need the money just as much as the people beyond the glass because at the end of the day we’re all still here. Exiting our observation room, at the end of the hall, past the locked door of the test subjects, is our new home, fitted with beds, a kitchen, a bathroom and of course a full camera monitoring set up so we can continue our work, day in, day out. We were only allowed in this room outside of regular working hours. Anyone not agreeing to these terms and who wants to go home was instructed to do so but not to return.  

 

**03/07/25 - 1250 hours** 

Entry 5 

There was a knock at my door last night, at least I think there was. Of course I didn’t answer, I didn’t even have the courage to get out of bed. It came during my extensive nightly attempt to sleep after my last entry. Just three quick taps of my motel door, a fair few feet away from me and instantly my breath was caught in my chest, I was unable to move a muscle. Like stone, like I wasn’t even alive, I lay there unmoving, waiting. Waiting for what, I don’t know, but the lord knows I waited. Waiting while the room is filled with nothing but the ticking clock above my head, heart lurching with every tick. And dread. The room was filled with dread, up to the brim. My ears catching every sound, I swear I could hear my own blood pump and yet I couldn’t tell if my heart was as still as I was or if it was fluttering and fleeing the confines of my ribcage. It must have been hours before I almost had the courage to shuffle an inch again. Alas, before my freedom was granted, another knock came. Another quick three taps. How could this be? The exact same knock, hours apart. I was surely hearing things again, I must be. But this felt so real, and my delusions come in quick intense spats, not this prolonging torture.  

Was it there? On the other side of the door. Waiting as I too am waiting. Still, as I too am still! Barely breathing as I too am barely breathing! I must be going mad. I can’t take this anymore, I thought. Now I knew for certain that my heart was racing, pumping, pounding! I was about to get up. Dear god I was actually about to go face this thing. Launch from my bed and lunge at the door, a desperate attack, an attempt better than nothing. Better than laying here for eternity. A clashing of symbols, an impact of a waterfall, a climax of an explosion, a RUSH. Fighting the bed sheets that engulfed me, I escaped my own mental restraints and sprinted for the door. Before even a blink could arrive, I did. Right at the door. Fate on the other side.  

 

 

Of course it was empty. Of course nothing was there. I stood with the door swung open and nothing but cool air brushing against me like a mother caressing and calming a child. As I began to close the door, as it slid past my face and almost shut, I saw it.  

 

A letter sat at my feet.  

 

**03/08/25 - 1652 hours** 

Entry 6 

By now it was August 28th, and we had adjusted to our living standards quickly. Alexa and Gabriella got along well, sharing notes, theories, and even started talking about their personal lives. Gabriella wanted to start her own lab and studies. Me and Craig even began to talk. Small talk and work talk but still talk. 

I pushed open the door to our main observation room that morning, balancing a paper cup filled with coffee on my clipboard, free hand used to button up my shirt. Craig was already there, leaning against the counter, staring through the glass. 

“Morning,”. I said as I joined him. 

Craig snorted. “Barely. You look like you lost a fight with your alarm clock.” 

“I did,” I replied. “It won by a landslide.” 

“Good to see you’re still getting your sleep.”  

I scoffed. “I wouldn’t say that” 

“Struggling huh?” He took a sip from his own coffee. “Yeah, me too. If they’re going to force us to sleep here, they could at least give us some half decent mattresses.” 

We shared a chuckle, even though we both knew the mattresses weren’t the issue. Then we went to work. We had a routine and things were nice. The subjects reported nothing more than difficulty sleeping, increased appetite and a small amount of anxiety, all of which could be attributed to their environment, so we brought in some requested items for each of them. The Bangladesh woman requested a photo of her family, the Singaporean uncle requested a potted plant, the gambler wanted his marriage ring (he was divorced), the African American man wanted a book from home, and the Korean girl shyly requested her bear plushy, said it helped her sleep. 

It was going smoothly. Those were the best days of the experiment. The last good day of our lives.  

“What’d you say?” The gambler said as he got up from his bed. Confused glances spread throughout their room as we, the watchers, leaned forward at our workstations.  “Don’t act dumb! What did you say? I “stink”?!” He said something along those lines. This time he received a series of “Huh's” and “what’s”, confusion and tension growing. His gaze was locked onto the Korean girl sitting on the floor with her bear plushy. Her innocence radiated from her, yet the gambler was in denial. He approached her and swiftly yanked her bear away from her.  

“I didn’t say shit, you freak!” She screamed in retaliation. “You do stink though.” she grumbled under her breath. This girl was usually quiet, for such a sudden outburst the plushy must’ve meant a lot to her. She couldn’t have been younger than 19 yet she clung to it like a child. By this escalation, the rest of the room began defending the girl.    
“What? No, I’m not crazy... I-” he said with shaky breaths as he held his head with one hand and the bear with the other. “No. No! I know what this is. This isn’t how it was meant to be. He said it was like a walkie-talkie! We can just turn it off. Are you able to hear what I think without my consent!? Why can I hear you all! Judging me!” He shouted, fear in his voice, holding the bear high.  

 

Test 2- 

Craig once again had control of the microphone as he instructed the room to calm down and return the girl's belongings to her. They were told to sit on their respective beds and listen. 

“Number one, I need you to focus. Please tell us what you're thinking,” Craig asked. 

“I want to go home. Are you sure I’ll be safe in here?” The girl said. Her rage had subsided and was replaced with a growing fear.  

“Please look at the rest of your roommates and decide if you can understand what they are thinking"" Craig visibly gulped down his empathy as he forced himself to ignore the girl's question and follow the script in our work outline. 

“No, I have no idea what they’re thinking.” She responded. 

“Number two, what are you thinking about?” Craig continued. 

“I think Number three should be removed from this experiment after that outburst.” The Bangladesh woman confessed. 

“Please look at the rest of your roommates and decide if you can understand what they are thinking,"" Craig repeated. After some deep thought, she had an answer for this seemingly silly question. 

“I think... someone is thinking of sunflowers again.”  

“Number three-” Craig began. 

“This is bullshit” The gambler cut off the voice echoing out of the speaker. “And I think someone wants their bear back” he continued. Odd, since the girl already had her bear plushy returned to her. 

“Number four.” 

“Well, uh, I must admit I was thinking of sunflowers.” The old Singaporean sat, staring at the Bangladesh woman who stared back. “I think she’s thinking of her children.” 

“Number five.” 

“I... want my bear back...” The large man sat so smally as he said this, staring at his hands and hunched over.  

“That is all for now.” one last note from Craig before he turned off the microphone and leaned back in his chair, brushing his hair back with a long exhale. The people inside the room split off into their usual groups and quietly discussed the results of this test. Number five sat on his own and read. We took our notes. 

 

**03/09/25 - I don't know what time it is** 

Entry 7 

My mirror was altered this morning. Everything morphed back to that place it took me. It felt like a stone had dropped inside my stomach once I realized what I was looking at. I was frozen, my eyes glued to the gaping maw of that beast's labyrinth that it had put me in. It was grinning. The walls melting around me, pooling at my feet, momentary madness coalescing as I witness spiraling swirls of chaos slowly forming from memories. Reflection shifted from me to Gabriella’s and Craig’s disgusted glare before I ran away and never came back. I abandoned them then and there. Then shifting once more to that thing. Then finally, to that place. 

The memory emerged through thick clouds of steam that clung to the mirror before they evaporated. I saw a longing held back behind tight lips for years. The face of someone I’d known for many more. The face of someone I loved for far too late. All along, these feelings were shared between us. What had we done? A passionate moment shared between friends. Friends.   
“Arthur... Arthur!”   
A moment and a mistake made a life. A life, not belonging to him, but to me. A life that ended too soon, before it even left the womb. That part was no one's fault. Guilt, shame, sadness, loss, resulting in the loss of another. 

I loved her first. It's not my fault. 

It showed me it all again. It showed everyone. Things I tried to desperately forget. There is no forgetting now. 

I could feel beads of sweating form and slide from every pore. I may have stood in that puddle of sweat for an hour, reliving what I’d done all over again. Worlds of pleasure and anguish had become too much, and I collapsed into a pathetic ball on my bathroom floor. I couldn’t resist crying.

Every day, we see the same frustrations: apps breaking workflows, forcing AI pop-ups, raising prices, and calling it “innovation.”

If you’re building something new (SaaS, mobile, enterprise) and planning to use AI as your *core feature*… this is for you.

Now everything is “AI.”  
Your coffee machine, your email, your to-do list, your cat feeder.

The hype is insane: “autonomous,” “instant,” “magic,” “revolutionary.”

But in reality?

It’s starting to feel like the new slogan for half these “AI-first” companies is:

**Overpromise. Underdeliver. Repeat.**

Raising prices, forcing AI features on users, and sparkles instead of real value.

And after you pay, nothing works as advertised:

* AI summaries that are confidently 40% wrong
* A photo of your ex captioned “Great times with friends!”
* Recommendations that look like they’re trolling you

The excitement turns into confusion → frustration → skepticism.

Then users do what users always do:

* Turn the AI off.
* Downgrade.
* Unsubscribe.
* Delete the app.

Less trust. More churn. Zero loyalty.

Welcome to **AI Fatigue**.

So what even is AI Fatigue?

It’s that instant eye-roll when:

* Gmail suggests replying “Great!” to a **job rejection**
* Amazon recommends a **$400 cat tree** because you bought kibble one time

These aren’t edge cases.  
This is daily life.

AI adds new decision points (“Is this suggestion useful or nonsense?”) faster than it removes any.

Meanwhile, the product playbook is now:

1. Wrap GPT-5 around a CRUD app
2. Call it “AI-first”
3. 3X the price
4. Post “Built in 2 days with 90% profit!”

This works… until users realize the AI wrapper adds nothing.

So, how to use AI without causing fatigue:

1. Solve a real pain point, not a marketing one

Ask: “Would users pay for this without the AI?”

2. Make AI invisible when possible

❌ Don’t say “Powered by AI!” every time.

✅ Spotify’s “AI DJ” feels magical, not gimmicky.

3. Let users control and correct AI

Add: “Thumbs down, ""Don’t show AI suggestions.”

4. Be transparent about limitations

Show confidence score or “This is a suggestion”

5. Default OFF for non-essential AI

Let users opt-in. “Summarize this email?” → Yes/No.

6. Focus on outcomes, not technology

Market the benefit, not the AI.

I’m in no means ready to date, I barely want to conversate with anyone. I’ve had 4 different men try to talk to me. I’m up and down a lot and admittedly I agreed to give these people at different times my number. Thinking just try and see what happens or at minimum just getting out of the house. 

1 out of the 4 I went on a 45 min date with. We did not click that much. He barely messaged me much after, in a span of 2 months, messaged me twice and asked if we should continue talking. I said it’s best if we don’t, I’m not really looking to date. He then berated me over and over about how I’m a shit person and how dare I waste his time? wtf? Blocked 

2 out of 4 met on my job site. The next time they talked to me bought me a little lunch, it was sweet, I was upfront about my situation, he said it’s ok and no pressure. When I didn’t want to hang out with him the next day he also berated me saying I need to make up my mind and he’s not putting up with this. (All in person, I just walked away) 

3 out 4 saw me walking my dog everyday in my neighborhood and kept trying to talk to me. I always had headphones in and waved and kept walking. Eventually they got micro conversations and I felt cornered into chatting with them, I noticed they would walk more frequently and search for me. I have now run opposite directions and or head on a swivel. 

4/4 last week, he saw me at dog park, followed me with his dogs to try and talk. He was nice we chatted. It was fine. Asked for my number. Like an idiot I said sure maybe I can have dog friends for my pup. He kept asking me to hang out with long big commitments like going to hockey games and concerts which I don’t know you, don’t feel comfortable doing something like that. If he asked for coffee or something first then maybe. Messaged me again yesterday to ask to go with him to some event. I straight up didn’t even know his name. I declined and he had the audacity to write me I don’t care for your games, let me know when you want to hang out otherwise I’m not texting you small talk. that was in a span of 3 days. 

I DONT KNOW THESE PEOPLE? Why do they think I owe them anything????? Am I crazy? I certainly am not giving out my number at all anymore, but 2 of them I didn’t, met “organically” or just couldn’t escape. I’m just trying to exist. 

EDIT: only guy 1 was a date. I didn’t pursue any of these people on my own. Guy 2. Is someone I work adjacent to and they decided to buy my lunch one day with other co-workers around. Guy 3. I’m literally hiding from. Guy 4 wanted to meet at dog park and I’ve made many friends that way, men and women. ",5,1763218058.0,BreakUps,21,0.86,False

Recently diagnosed in my 50's and started generic Adderall XR a week ago. Until recently I would have never considered myself ADHD, but either age or job change highlighted an inability to concentrate after the coffee wore off. Looking back, symptoms were there, but self medication through caffeine and nicotine caried me through. Been reading all your stories and thought why not reach out here for help. Reddit can be a snarky place and I was pleasantly surprised by how supportive you all are.     
  
The first day I experienced a calmness I have never felt, but from there, the effects have been inconsistent. Energy levels lower 4-5 hours after dose to varying degrees, but I notice the focus I have fluctuates greatly throughout the day, almost randomly (Have a crazy doc tracking everything. Science!) One perfect day and five random ones so far. 

  
My food and water intake is pretty consistent with a protein bar eaten with the meds and protein or high fiber breakfast a couple hours later. 16-20oz coffee before 9 with an occasional green tea after lunch. Lunch is consistently about 500-700cal, not carb heavy, and generally healthy.

  
I can't see a pattern and it is driving me a bit more crazy than it should. Any advice or wisdom you all have would be much appreciated. Wow, a lot of words, guess I can mark off energy and focus for this morning on my tracker!",1,1763217790.0,ADHD,7,1.0,False

I gave you an out, hoping you wouldn’t take it, but you took it so quickly. So easily. Almost without a thought. Almost as if you were hoping for it.

I shouldn’t be surprised, I’m the one who romanticizes the smallest things. 2 coffee meets and I’m already planning our next decade together. Playing our whirlwind romance in my head like a movie. And our 3rd date was going to be perfect.

I’d go off-grid for a couple of weeks, I’d have the strength not to text you and focus on other things for a bit. And then, on a Tuesday, I’d voice message you out of the blue: “cancel your plans this Friday. Meet me at the waterfront at 6.” You’d confirm the night before like you always do, and you’d meet me on Friday at 6:01, so as not to seem too eager.

Then we’d watch the sky turn orange, then blue, fading behind the city line, and we’d watch the buildings slowly light up. We’d share a pre-roll and talk about nothing important, just tease each other and note our surroundings, or say nothing and just exist in the moment. We’d take pictures of the view, and subtly put each other in the corners.

I’d grab your hand and we’d run to the nearest cheap restaurant that’ll seat us, because it’s a chilly Friday night and I didn’t make a reservation. But we’d find a homey, hole in the wall taco spot with a staff that feels like your family. They’d give us free margaritas and make you laugh all night while winking at me. And I’d just be observing you, capturing every detail of your cadence and the way your lips move.

Then we’d find a speakeasy, somewhere dimly lit and moody, maybe old time prohibition style like the Dark Room. We’d order drinks and sit next to each other on a burgundy loveseat, designed to make sure our body’s touch with any movement.

Here is where we’d start talking about the future. Our big plans, where to travel next, what weird business to start. And because we’re sitting so close, making eye contact puts me very close to your face. And I can’t help but keep turning the conversation more and more suggestive. And touching you by accident. And then not by accident.

I won’t give you details of our first kiss, thats for my mind, and mine only. But it’s safe to say it ended at your apartment. You can only hold my gaze so long before I decide something needs to be done.

The worst part is, I’m speaking us into non-existence. I’ve made sure it’ll never happen, by fucking up again. Not being centered. Not being strong enough. The world needs me to be tougher, there’s not enough room for artists and feelers right now. So I have to harden a bit. And let the ideas of feeling alive and infinite with you flow away, materializing in a different reality.

I want to believe you weren’t just a vessel for limerence. I want to believe we actually had a spark. But I guess I’ll never know for sure, and I guess that has to be okay. And it will someday. Just not now.

The Garden of Bleeding Roses. This is a place of love, a place of hate. This is a place of heaven, a place of hell. This is a place of healing, a place of bloodshed. It’s a place of whatever you want it to be, whatever you need it to be. A place where you can find the meaning of life, as long as you can find the meaning of your death. It’s a place that knows your desires and trauma and uses it against you. There are three rules you must follow.
You cannot come without a Roman flatbread and wine, as it represents flesh and blood.
You must not call or pray to your gods, no matter what happens, as they cannot hear you.
You must bring a bunch of grapes as your only meal, as once you enter, you are considered royalty.
Follow these rules and you will come out alive and if you disobey, what comes out will not be what you used to be. 

His hand shook over the mouse. Looking at the screen, he read over and over. He knew the Garden of Bleeding Roses wasn't a real place… but what if it was? His nostrils were filled with the smell of copper. He smelled the blood of the roses. He read it again and felt less intrigued. In the place of the curiosity he felt before was this sinking dread. There was a new sentence that he hadn't noticed before… no, it hadn't been there before.
“This is a place of life, a place of death.”
Jack was sure that hadn't been there before, it stuck out like a thorn on a rose. It had been added when he wasn't looking, which was impossible because he was looking at an image. 
He left the room. He was too confused and scared by what just happened. As he went downstairs, he felt his cat brush up on his leg. He knelt down and started petting his cat, his fur feeling of cotton and cloth.
“Hey Nugget, you want some food?”
Nugget purred and pawed at him.
“K, let's go get you some food.”
As he walked down the stairs, holding Nugget, he couldn't stop thinking about that last line.
“This is a place of life, a place of death.”

He fed his cat and turned on the TV but when he turned it on, all that was showing was static. Prickly, sharp static. He tried changing the station, but nothing worked. 
He saw his cat looking at the TV, back arched. He tried calming down his cat by petting him, but the second he touched him, his blood ran cold as a flower petal on a harsh winter night. He felt something prick his skin. He looked at his finger and a trail of crimson ran down. Looking back at his cat, he saw something that made bile climb up his throat. A rose bush was making its way around his cat. He went to stand up and grab his cat, but couldn't move his legs. He looked down and saw a rose bush rapidly climbing up his legs. He looked back at the TV and it was no longer showing static. What he saw made him throw up. It was that image. 
That God forsaken, evil image of The Garden of Bleeding Roses. He got snapped out of looking at the image by a crunching sound followed by a cat screeching. He looked over and saw the rose bushes had completely consumed his cat. The screeching continued and he couldn't stand it. He went through his pockets to find anything that could cut the rose bush off his cat. Finally, he grabbed a pocket knife. He leaned as close as he could and cut the rose bush. 
The pricks of the thorns were agony, but his cat was in hell and he couldn't stand it. Eventually, he got the cat unstuck. Nugget ran out the cat door. He thought he could get himself out too, but a bush grabbed his arm and pulled him down. He felt his bones cracking and knew it was too late. The Garden of Bleeding Roses had consumed him.

Chapter 1: Nugget
Cameron looked at the cat, heartbroken. Someone had found a cat with broken bones and brought it to the animal shelter where Cameron worked. What sick monster would break their cat’s bones. Cameron checked the collar of the cat.
“Nugget, you poor thing. I'm so sorry you were abused like that. You're safe here though, don't worry little guy.”
Nugget laid there, being prepped for an amputation. His back left leg was crushed so badly that his leg flopped around like a dying flower. 
“Listen Nugget, once you leave surgery, you will not have a leg anymore. I love you little guy.”
Nugget meowed at Cameron, as if he understood what he was saying.
He stroked Nugget’s head, careful not to touch the mangled leg. 
“You’re going to be okay… we’ll get through this together. I'm sorry your owner hurt you. I'm going to take you home Nugget-”
Nugget hissed at Cameron, not out of anger but seeming to be of sadness. No, not sadness but… loneliness.

The amputation of Nuggets leg was successful. Cameron entered the room to bring Nugget home. Entering the surgery room, he couldn’t help but notice the sterile smell of it all. This clean, almost bleachy smell made him almost break down in tears. His previous cat, Peter, had died in his arms in this exact same room. The exact same smell was in the room. Despite Cameron being glad Nugget was alive, he couldn’t help but ask why it couldn’t have been Peter too. Why couldn’t Nugget and Peter be alive? Why couldn’t he have two loveable cats living life with him? He remembered Peter’s chest rising once, then never again. He remembered hearing Peter's heart beat in sync with his before slowly becoming slower and slower until… it wasn't there with Camerons anymore. Cameron had let Peter outside a few days before he would die. Peter ran into Cameron’s rose bushes. Something must’ve bitten Peter, because he was bleeding when he came in and over the next few days, he became frail and weak before he would die in Cameron’s arms. 

“Cameron, are you here to pick up Nugget?”
Cameron was snapped out of his thoughts and looked at Jane.
“Oh, hey Jane. Yeah, I’m here to grab Nugget, and I'm gonna take him home.”
“Okay, sounds good. Oh, also on your way home could you bring this to Jeff?”
Jane grabbed a box with rats in it. Jane continued what she was saying.
“Just some dead rats for his snake.”
“Oh yeah, of course. I’ll eat dinner at his place while I’m at it.”

Cameron's car didn't have Bluetooth. This didn't bother Cameron though, due to the fact he had a very specific hobby. He collected CD's. Rock, rap, pop, doesn't matter. He has a CD of whatever he wants. Today he was feeling in the mood for rap, so he grabbed the first rap cd in his bag, that being Cherry Bomb by Tyler, The Creator. The CD felt rough and used. He could feel every crack and imperfection on the case. It bugged Cameron. He put the CD back and grabbed his most recent CD he purchased, some experimental horror ambient album. He looked at the name. It was called “Compositions Arranged in The Garden of Bleeding Roses.” It sounded pretentious, like something someone who actually watches movies like Hereditary or Midsommar would listen to.
He looked at the tracklist. The names were as fancy and pretentious as the name of the album.
Blood on The Roses (8:41)
Crimson Petals (9:57)
Gore Tulips (2:53)
The Light Has Diminished (15:25)
A Place of Life, A Place Of Death (11:11)
Deadly Improvisations [Bonus Track] (5:23)
This is fifty-three minutes and thirty seconds. It's definitely some avant garde pretentious album. Cameron was snapped out of his annoyance when he heard Nugget meow.
“Oh, hey little guy.”
Nugget meowed again.
“Sorry for sitting here so long, let me just pop in this CD and I'll get going.”
Nugget laid down after Cameron said that. He grabbed the CD, which was a dark red on the front but somehow shinier than usual on the back, and popped it in. The second the music started though, Nugget started hissing. Nuggets back was arched and he started screeching and trying to attack the CD case. Cameron immediately popped out the CD, put it back in its case, although, when he put the CD back in the case it felt… sticky. He grabbed Call Me If You Get Lost, perfect. He popped it in, comforted Nugget, and drove away.

As the song JUGGERNAUT started playing, he pulled into Jeff's driveway. Jeff was already outside, smoking. When he saw Cameron pull up, he got out of his chair and ran up to the car and banged on the window.
“Ay Cameron, get out here man! The new Carti album dropped!”
Cameron slowly grabbed Nugget and rolled his eyes. Jeff always cared about Playboi Carti too much.
Cameron walked up to Jeff and said, “I know Jeff. I listened to it and it was mid. Had three government mandated Travis Scott features that weren't even that good and even though Kendrick was on it, it didn't improve it in any way. Making us wait five years for the most subpar Carti album yet.”
Jeff looked at Cameron like he just saw a murder.
“Nah man, you trippin’ homie. That was a generational album. Carti killed it.”
“Whatever you say Jeff the Killer.”
“Man, shut up. I had that creepypasta phase when I was 14, get over it.”
Cameron laughed. Cameron and Jane came up with the nickname Jeff the Killer back in middle school because of Jeff's obsession with creepypasta.
“Anyways, I got the rats for your snake. They stunk up the car on the way here, so you're giving me some air freshener.
Jeff looked at Cameron pissed. Jeff handed Cameron an air freshener. 
“It's getting late Cameron, you should get home.”
Cameron thought for a moment and asked “Could I crash at your place tonight? My place is an hour away and I am starved.”
Jeff looked at Cameron, half excited, half annoyed.
“Fine, come inside. My girlfriend's making dinner tonight, so you know we're about to eat good.”
Jeff's girlfriend, Mia, was an amazing cook. He was excited. 
He walked into the house and Mia looked over and smiled.
“Cameron! Nice to see you. Are you just staying for dinner or are you staying overnight?”
“I'm staying overnight, if you don't mind at least.”
“Why would I mind? You're always welcome here- oh hello little guy! Who's the precious kitty in the cage?”
Nugget meowed at Mia.
“Oh, that's Nugget. I'm taking him in, he just got his leg amputated unfortunately.”
Mia looked shocked when Cameron said the last part.
“Oh no, what happened to his leg?”
Cameron took a deep breath and replied “Someone found him limping on the side of the road. When they brought him in, it turned out his bones were broken. We assume that he was abused by his previous owner, we got police checking the house on his old collar tomorrow.”
Mia looked at Nugget, teary eyed.
“You poor creature. How could anyone hurt an innocent animal like you? Don't worry, you're safe here.”
Cameron let Nugget out of the cage and Nugget limped over to Mia and brushed up against her. Mia sat down and pet Nugget slowly and carefully.

Mia made a creamy butternut squash soup, with basil and rosemary. She had made some fish for Nugget, due to the fact they only had dog food. Nugget had warmed up to everyone quickly. Looking over, he saw that Jeff and Mia's dog was finally coming out. He was an old dog, twelve years old. Cameron took the final sip of his soup before walking over to the sink, about to wash his bowl.
“Cameron, what are you doing? Just put it in the dishwasher.” Mia said, confused.
“Oh crap, sorry. Force of habit.” Cameron replied, embarrassed.
Once Cameron put his bowl in the dishwasher, he went over to Marshall, their dog, and started petting him. Marshall's fur was dry and scratchy, it had been a while since it was soft. Cameron remembered when Jeff got Marshall, he was graduating high school and his parents got it for him as a gift. Cameron looked at Marshall. He knew that within the next six months, he would be in the vet office with Jane, Jeff, and Mia. Marshall was an old dog and would pass away very soon.
“Cameron, you’ve been petting Marshall and staring into space for almost ten minutes, you okay dude?” Jeff asked, pulling Cameron out of his daze. 
“Oh, yeah. I’m okay, just… tired. I think I’m gonna go to bed, goodnight dude.”
Jeff responded, but Cameron walked to the guest room with Nugget.

Cameron was driving to the animal shelter. When he woke up, Nugget was already in the living room with Jeff and Mia, being fed more fish. Cameron had eaten, had a coffee, quickly said goodbye and left all in 45 minutes. Nugget was sleeping in his cage and Cameron was listening to The Eminem Show. As he arrived at work, he saw police standing outside with Jane with them, looking worried. He pulled in and grabbed Nugget. Cameron walked up to the officers, tense. One of the officers started to speak. 
“Hello. You’re Cameron, the one who’s taking in Nugget, right?’
“Yeah, why? Is something wrong?”
“Well, we checked the house that the back of Nuggets collar listed and inside… someone was dead inside. Bones crushed, like Nuggets. We assume it’s a homicide case, but we will need to check more into the case. The person we found dead was Jack Farston.”
Cameron looked down at Nugget, who seemed to almost be… crying.

Cameron was tired. It was only 12:27 in the afternoon, but Cameron needed a drink. He reached into his bag and grabbed a preworkout, some iced tea flavor. He opened the pouch and poured it into his water bottle. He smelled the pouch and started coughing, this crap could be used as a damn alternative for smelling salts. He threw the pouch away and shook his bottle and chugged the iced tea. It took about five minutes, but suddenly, Cameron was energized.

As the caffeine started to wear off, he checked the time. It was 3:07 in the afternoon, he would be off work in about an hour.",1,1763217372.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

""Sweetheart, have you thought about what we talked about last time? Your grandfather's health is getting worse. You're our only daughter. Don't you want to come home and take over the company?""

In the quiet room, Demi Snow held a paintbrush while listening to her mother's worn voice on the phone.

The dim light cast a soft glow over her canvas as she drew the final stroke of a family of three.

Carol Snow thought this was another failed attempt. But unexpectedly, Demi spoke softly, ""Okay.""

Carol froze for a moment, surprised. ""Y-you agreed?""

""Yes,"" Demi said calmly. ""I'll come home. I just need some time to finish things here. I'll be home within two weeks.""

After exchanging a few more words, Demi ended the call.

She walked out of her studio and looked down from the staircase into the living room. Three people sat there.

Her gaze lingered on the man sitting on the couch.

He had sharp, handsome features—deep-set eyes, clean lines, and a quiet, serious aura. His shirt was buttoned all the way up, his dress pants crisp and perfect. Everything about him screamed control and elegance.

That was her husband, Nevin Blackwell, the man she had chosen against her family's wishes. She once believed Nevin was worth giving up everything for.

Nevin was known for his cold, distant manner. People in his circle called him the Ice Prince. But right now, he was smiling softly at another woman.

Nearby, a six-year-old boy with bright eyes ran into the woman's arms. ""Rhea, can you make me some orange-glazed fish? Please?""

Rhea Dunn touched his nose affectionately and smiled. ""Of course, cupcake.""

Orion Blackwell's eyes lit up with joy. ""You're the best! You're different than my mom; she never lets me eat what I want.""

He pouted after saying that.

Rhea smiled and said gently, ""Then you should eat a little more today.""

Orion nodded, his face bright with a sweet grin. ""Rhea, you're so nice. I wish you were my real mom.""

Rhea's smile deepened.

Upstairs, Demi's heart ached painfully.

She knew Orion could get greedy with food. Demi limited his portions because she didn't want his stomach to hurt later.

But watching them now—her husband, her son, and that woman—they looked like a real family. She was the one left out.

Demi went back to her room.

A few minutes later, footsteps sounded outside.

The door opened. Rhea walked in, her makeup flawless, her expression soft and gentle. ""Demi,"" she said sweetly, ""let's go downstairs and celebrate Orion's birthday together.""

Rhea used to be her intern. She'd come from a poor family and had just enough skill to get by. Demi still remembered the day Rhea broke down in her office, crying that if she couldn't find a job soon, she'd have to marry some guy back home.

Demi had taken pity on her and brought her into the company.

Who could've guessed she'd end up inviting a snake into her home?

Rhea copied everything Demi did—her style, her voice, and even how she spoke to Nevin. By the time Demi realized it, Rhea was already part of their home, close to both her husband and her son.

Demi had long seen through her act. She hated herself for letting a snake into the house.

""I'm not feeling well,"" she said coldly. ""I'll pass.""

Rhea put on her best innocent act. ""Demi, you're his mom. Orion needs your blessing today.""

Demi frowned, ready to refuse again, but then stopped. She sighed.

This is between me and Rhea. Orion shouldn't suffer because of it.

As his mother, I owe him my presence on his birthday.

Demi put down her paintbrush, brushed past Rhea, and headed downstairs.

For a second, Rhea's smile stiffened. A flash of malice crossed her eyes before she followed.

When Demi saw Nevin and Orion together, she froze.

Ten years ago, she joined Blackwell Group to gain experience and met Nevin there. They fought, laughed, and somehow fell in love. Against her family's wishes, she married him. Demi even cut ties with them because of it.

For the past decade, Demi never once regretted her choice. She had a rich, handsome husband who treated her well and a smart, adorable child.

She thought her life was perfect until Rhea showed up.

Demi watched as Rhea smiled sweetly, serving food for Nevin and Orion.

Rhea's arrival had shattered everything that once felt beautiful.

Demi picked up her fork, ready to eat, but suddenly felt a wave of nausea.

She set it down quickly and ran to the restroom, retching over the sink.

Nevin looked worried and started to follow her, but Rhea stopped him. Her eyes filled with concern.

""Mr. Blackwell, what's wrong with Demi?"" she asked anxiously.

Nevin comforted gently. ""She's been doing this lately. It's nothing; don't worry.""

Then he turned toward the restroom and mocked coldly, ""What's your excuse this time? Did you catch a cold? Or is the food not good enough again?""

Demi said nothing. She wiped the corner of her mouth with a tissue.

If she told them she was pregnant, would anyone believe her?

Forget it. She was already planning to leave. Why should she tell them?

There's no point in ruining the sweet moment between her husband and that homewrecker.

Rhea was a secretary, but she had the nerve to scold her boss. ""Mr. Blackwell, don't talk like that. Maybe she really doesn't feel well. She's lost so much weight lately.""

She stood up, poured a cup of hot tea, and handed it to Demi.

""Are you okay? Here, drink some tea.""

The sight of her disgusting face made Demi feel even sicker. Irritated, she pushed her hand away.

She hadn't used much force, but Rhea stumbled slightly. Somehow, the water spilled on Rhea's hand.

""Ouch!"" Rhea cried out in pain.

""Rhea!""

""Rhea!""

Nevin and Orion rushed over at the same time. The father and son stared at Rhea's red, scalded hand with panic and concern.

Her fair skin had turned bright red from the burn.

Tears filled Orion's eyes as he looked at Rhea. ""Does it hurt a lot?"" The boy asked softly, his voice trembling with worry.

Rhea forced a smile, pretending to be strong. ""It's okay, Orion. I wasn't careful. It doesn't hurt.""

Nevin turned toward Demi, his eyes burning with anger.

His voice was cold as ice. ""What trouble are you trying to cause this time?""

Demi's heart twisted in pain. She caught Rhea's smug look, then saw her son standing protectively in front of her. Hopelessness washed over her, and she closed her eyes.

""I didn't do anything,"" she said quietly.

But of course, Nevin didn't believe her.

When the family doctor arrived, Nevin helped Rhea sit up, letting her lean against his chest. His dark eyes were filled with disappointment.

""Demi, you've changed. The woman I knew would never do something like this out of jealousy.""

Changed?

Yes. She had changed.

Ten years ago, she wouldn't have had a stomach full of stretch marks from giving birth. She wouldn't have dull skin from sleepless nights.

And she wouldn't have given up her career to cook and clean for a man, only to be replaced by someone new.

Demi suddenly felt exhausted. She swallowed her explanation and went upstairs.

Before entering her room, she looked back one last time. The living room was chaos, but in the middle of it stood her husband and son, both surrounding Rhea with concern, like a perfect little family.

Demi smiled bitterly and shook her head. Gently, she placed a hand on her stomach and set a countdown to her departure on her phone.

Then she walked into her room without hesitation.

From that moment on, she promised herself she would never disturb them again.            


Chapter 2 I'm Done Playing This Ridiculous Game


The noise outside slowly faded away. Demi didn't care what was going on. She just put on her earplugs and eye mask and slept until morning.

She'd decided to go home and took over the family business. That meant she had to quit her job here.

Since giving birth to Orion, she had rarely appeared at the company. But back when Nevin took over the Blackwell Group, she was right there beside him, helping build everything step by step.

Blackwell Group wouldn't have become the country's top firm without her.

So even though she hadn't worked in the office for years, she still received a large annual bonus and dividends.

Early that morning, Demi stared at her reflection in the mirror. Her long wavy brown hair framed a delicate face, but her pretty charming eyes carried no trace of a smile.

She was beautiful. No one could deny that. Even after years as a stay-at-home wife, all the exhaustion and stress hadn't taken away her charm.

But the emotional abuse at home and the stress of pregnancy had drained the light from her eyes, making them look lifeless and dull now.

At the top floor of Blackwell Group, Demi was waiting for her resignation papers to be printed.

Behind her, she overheard a few employees chatting.

""Did you see Rhea's Instagram?""

""Not yet. What did she post this time?""

""Plenty. Looks like she was celebrating someone's birthday. You've got to see it.""

They laughed, but when they looked up and saw Demi standing there, their smiles froze.

""Uh—M-Ms. Snow?""

""Ms. Snow, you're back at the office?""

Demi gave them a polite nod. They quickly murmured a goodbye and rushed off.

As they disappeared down the hall, she could still hear them whispering.

""Ugh, what bad luck. Why's Demi here?""

""She's already married Mr. Blackwell. Why show off in front of us?""

""Please, I bet she and Mr. Blackwell aren't doing great. Wouldn't be surprised if they're getting divorced.""

Demi wasn't bothered with this. She was used to this kind of talk. Her coworkers had never liked her much.

If it hadn't been for all the office bullying she faced early on and Nevin stepping in to help, she probably would've never fallen for him.

Bored from waiting, she unlocked her phone and opened Instagram.

The first thing she saw was Rhea's new post. A collage of nine pictures.

The first one was from Orion's birthday party last night, lavishly decorated with balloons and a huge three-layer cake right in the center.

But what caught Demi's eye was a hospital photo. Three hands of different sizes stacked together. It looked warm and cozy.

A trip to the hospital again? Just for a burn?

Demi let out a dry laugh and scrolled through the comments. They were all full of envy and well wishes.

[Wow! A birthday party for the little one? So sweet!]

[Another lovey-dovey post! Who's your mystery man, girl? Show us already]

[Doesn't matter what happens—as long as the family's together, that's happiness.]

The comments went on and on.

She knew exactly what Rhea was doing. Rhea was trying to get under her skin, trying to make her lose control, run to Nevin, and demand answers.

Once upon a time, that would've worked. She couldn't stand seeing that fake sweetness or how her husband and son would rather be with a woman who copied her every move.

But now? She was leaving soon. None of it mattered anymore.

Demi let out a faint smile and tapped the little red heart beneath the post.

A moment later, with her resignation letter in hand, Demi went straight to the CEO's office and handed it to Nevin's personal assistant.

The people in the secretary department were whispering behind her back, mocking her for showing off at the office as if she owned the place. But the moment they saw the resignation letter, the room went silent. Then someone gasped.

""""What—wait, am I seeing this right?!""

""Ms. Snow is resigning?!""

The assistant froze, panic flashing across her face. ""Mr. Blackwell is in an important meeting. Maybe we should wait until he's done—""

""Don't bother,"" Demi said with a calm smile. ""I'm just the chief of secretary in name only, remember? You have the authority to process it. No need to trouble him.""

People around whispered in low voices. ""Could the rumors be true? Did Demi and Mr. Blackwell break up? Is Ms. Dunn turning out to be a homewrecker?""

""Why did you assume it's Ms. Dunn? Isn't she married?""

""You're clueless. Did you see that hand on Instagram? That Rolex costs a fortune. No one in all of Yraka could afford it except Mr. Blackwell.""

""Exactly. Didn't you notice that Ms. Dunn took over all Ms. Snow's work after she went on maternity leave?""

""And now that she's quitting, maybe it's because she's stepping aside for good!""

Demi could hear every word of it. They'd always loved gossiping. In the past, she would've been crushed, hiding under the covers and crying into her pillow.

But now? She suddenly realized none of it mattered anymore.

She smiled at everyone as if she hadn't heard a thing, bowed politely, and said, ""Thank you all for your hard work over the past ten years. I hope Blackwell Group continues to grow and thrive.""

The office fell silent. No one knew what to say. Demi walked back to her desk and began packing up her things.

After ten years, her workspace was filled to the brim. Ten years' worth of memories were stacked neatly in front of her—books she bought when she first joined, binders filled with notes, and her old planner from when she became Nevin's secretary.

Flipping it open, she saw her handwriting still crisp and clear.

""1. He drinks a cup of hand-ground coffee every morning.""

""2. He hates people being late.""

""3. He can't stand women who wear perfume.""

Page after page was filled with small details about him—his habits, his preferences, and his temper. Every line represented her dedication.

Only God knew what Demi had gone through to be a good secretary. People always thought being a secretary was easy, that it just meant being pretty and pleasing a man with their body. They had no idea how wrong they were.

Nevin was the only one who'd ever seen the truth. He'd seen her stay late night after night, reading contracts until her eyes hurt, building presentations from scratch, and researching every single competitor the company ever had. She could list every company's data and performance by heart.

It was because of her relentless effort that the untouchable Ice Prince of the Blackwell family finally stepped down from his pedestal and became the man everyone admired today.

Demi once believed Nevin understood her better than anyone else in the world. She thought their bond went deeper than love, that they shared the same dream, the same fight. She was wrong.

Ten years of devotion, ten years of struggle and love—all of it had turned into nothing but ashes.

Demi quietly focused on cleaning up her desk when the meeting ended. Rhea was the first to step out.

She looked quite cheerful at first, but the moment she saw Demi, her smile froze.

What is she doing here?

Did Demi see the post on Instagram? Is she here to confront me?

Rhea grew excited just thinking about it. She couldn't sit still as she went back to her desk, waiting nervously for the storm to hit.

She lowered her head, eyes red, looking like she'd just been terribly wronged.

Nevin was the last to leave the conference room. As he passed the secretary department, he noticed Demi sitting there.

Her desk was the closest to his office—a symbol of trust and affection back in the days when they were still in love.

But now, just the sight of her made him irritated.

What made it worse was how cheerful she looked. Demi was flipping through a book with a small smile on her face.

Across from her, Rhea sat miserably, dabbing her tears with a tissue.

Nevin frowned.

He tapped the edge of Demi's desk and said coldly, ""Come in.""

Demi looked up, her expression composed. ""Okay,"" she replied simply.

The moment she stepped into his office, his voice turned icy.

""The company doesn't need you here anymore. Unless there's something important, don't show up in the office again.""            


Chapter 3 I Quit, Mr. Blackwell


Demi froze. No matter how many times Nevin had disappointed her, his cold voice still pierced her heart like a needle.

Her smile faded. ""Alright,"" she said quietly, eyes downcast.

Nevin had expected Demi to fight back, maybe even yell. But her calm obedience caught him off guard. For the first time, he really looked at her.

Rhea was right. Demi had lost a lot of weight lately.

Maybe her nausea last night wasn't a jealous act after all.

Nevin pressed his lips together, his tone softening a little. ""Ms. Dunn is doing great at her job. Your only duty now is to take care of Orion.""

Then his voice turned sharp again. ""I've told you many times—there's nothing going on between me and her. Demi, stop being dramatic. Don't make me regret choosing you as my wife.""

Regret?

She smiled bitterly. If anyone regretted it, it was her. She had given up her family business and traded it for this hollow title as his wife.

Demi came from a prestigious family. Wouldn't it be better to go back and live as the beloved heiress of the Snow Group, adored and protected by everyone?

Closing her eyes, Demi pulled out an envelope and handed it to him. Her tone was polite but distant. ""Mr. Blackwell, please approve my resignation. Starting tomorrow, I'll officially leave the company.""

She turned to leave, but just as she reached the door, Nevin grabbed her arm.

""Demi?""

His voice carried surprise, as if he hadn't processed what just happened.

Nevin glanced down at the resignation letter in his hand, her signature printed clearly in black ink. His face darkened, anger flickering in his eyes.

""You're doing this out of spite?"" he demanded.

""I thought you came here to make peace, but you're just making it worse?""

Demi kept her gaze low, her long lashes trembling slightly.

""No, Mr. Blackwell,"" she said calmly. ""You said the company doesn't need me. Turns out, I feel the same way.""

""Ten years have passed. This company isn't what it used to be,"" Demi said calmly. ""Since everyone seems to adore Ms. Dunn, there's no point in me sitting around collecting a paycheck. I'd rather step down and make room for her.""

Nevin let out a cold laugh. His eyes were sharp as blades, cutting straight through her words.

""Don't use these ten years to guilt-trip me. I know how much you've done for this company. You were a good employee once. But Demi, ever since you gave birth, you haven't been involved in business at all. I've been patient with you.""

He leaned closer, his tone low and dismissive. ""As long as you take care of our child, you'll always be the lady of the household. That's all I've ever asked, but you couldn't even manage that.""

Nevin's voice grew harsher. ""And now you want to step down gracefully? You just want to throw Rhea into the spotlight and make her take the blame. Demi, I know you too well. You're full of scheme, but I'm warning you don't be so vicious.""

He paused, his voice dripping with sarcasm. ""Have you even apologized to Rhea for the incident happened last night?""

Apologize?

To the homewrecker destroyed my family?

Shouldn't Rhea be the one who owed me a thank you?

Demi suddenly laughed, the sound soft but cutting. She tilted her head, looking at him with calm curiosity. ""You're right. I'm vicious. But tell me, Mr. Blackwell, have you ever thought about giving up the appearance?""

By giving up meant divorce.

They'd fought about it many times over the years. Every argument ended the same way—no resolution, just silence.

Nevin would never agree. Even if he cheated, Demi was still his wife.

That was the kind of man Nevin was—controlling, arrogant, and born to dominate.

At first, Demi didn't really want to leave. She just wanted him to look at her again, to remember she was there.

But now, she was tired.

A clean break, each walked their own ways.

Each of them had a child. That didn't sound so bad anymore.

Nevin's expression darkened like a storm. He grabbed her arm so hard it hurt, his grip full of rage.

""This is your last chance, Demi. If you keep failing, I'll have to find Orion a new mother.""

He didn't stop there. ""Do you know how many times Orion's told me he's miserable with you? No fun. No freedom. Nothing.""

His voice turned to ice. ""Why do you fail at everything—as a wife and as a mother?""

Failure.

Demi closed her eyes and let out a long, shaky breath.

So that's how it was.

All those nights she stayed up waiting for him, making him warm lemon tea after his drinking session was a failure.

The times she hand-washed his couture suits and got frostbite in the dead of winter—failure.

Even teaching their son advanced math to meet the high standards of being a heir of the Blackwells—still a failure.

There was no place left for her in this house.

""I'm sorry, Mr. Blackwell,"" she said quietly.

Her tone was calm, sincere.

A loser should know when to take her final bow.

Her other hand slipped into her pocket. She opened her phone and tapped the screen.

A countdown started—another 14 days to go.

When it hit zero, she would be gone. Completely. No more arguments, no more tears, no more bothering Nevin with her existence.

Her calmness caught him off guard.

Nevin wanted to say something—anything—but Demi didn't give him the chance.

She walked away resolutely. Nevin reached out to stop her, but his hand closed on nothing but air.

A sharp pain clenched his chest as he watched her go, a strange panic building inside him.

Nevin frowned, watching Demi walk away. It felt like something important, something he couldn't name was slipping further and further from him.

Once she stepped outside, Demi pulled out her phone and made a call to her best friend, Phoebe Lennon.

They used to be best friends, but they hadn't spoken in seven years.

Phoebe was a fashion designer who practically lived on airplanes, traveling across the country to tailor clothes for models.

Some were male, some female. Well, things sometimes happened between adults who worked that closely.

To put it simply, Phoebe changed boyfriends as easily as changing outfits. Nevin couldn't stand that about her. After Demi gave birth to Orion, he told her to stay away from Phoebe, worried she'd be a bad influence and corrupted their son.

And Demi listened. She actually listened. For six whole years, she cut off her oldest friend, just because her husband said so.

It had been a long time since Phoebe last heard from Demi. The moment she picked up, her voice was sharp with anger. ""So you finally remembered me! I thought you'd completely lost your mind over that man. What happened? Regret finally hit you?""

Demi couldn't help but laugh through her tears.

Nevin's insults hadn't made her cry. Rhea's tricks hadn't made her cry. Even watching her son calling another woman mother hadn't broken her.

But hearing Phoebe's voice did. For the first time, she cried from regret.

""Yes,"" she admitted. ""I regret it. Phoebe, Is it too late to come back to you now?""

Hearing Demi's sincere voice, there was a long pause on the other end. When Phoebe finally spoke again, her voice was trembling with tears too.

""It's never too late. You finally came to your senses. You idiot, do you know how hard it's been running the studio without you all these years?""

Her tone turned fierce again, full of emotion. ""The entire art world's been waiting for you! Demi, being a corporate secretary is a waste of your gift. You were born to hold a brush—you're the greatest painter of our time, the last jewel of the Impressionists. I've been waiting for you.""

""I'm sorry, Phoebe. I'm so sorry.""

Standing on the busy street, Demi crouched down and sobbed.

She should've never forgotten who she was. She used to be so proud.

Born gifted, brilliant, and proud—Nevin never even knew that Demi had studied fine arts overseas.

Her graduation piece had been selected for the Janbus International Art Exhibition, shocking the art world.

After that, her paintings sold for seven-figure prices at auction.

And yet, she'd walked away from all of it. For the sake of living experience, she had taken a regular office job, learned administration, finance, and management and still excelled.

After ten long years away from her canvas, she decided she was done hiding. She was going home—to art, to herself.             


Chapter 4 I'm Done with This Ungrateful Brat


After setting a date with Phoebe to hand over the studio, Demi went home.

She gave herself two weeks. Ten years was such a long time. There were too many loose ends to tie up before she could walk away for good.

The biggest issue at hand was the household itself.

The huge 5,000-square-foot villa didn't have a single helper because Nevin complained they were noisy.

So, Demi handled every bit of cleaning herself.

If she was going to leave, she wanted to do it gracefully—like a professional, like the perfect secretary she'd always been. That was her pride as the heiress of the Snows.

Rhea, of course, wasn't the type to do chores. Demi decided to find a good maid for her husband and son.

All day, she interviewed candidates. She asked them to cook soups the way Nevin liked them. That night, while Demi was having dinner, a panicked shout came from the door.

""Bill! Call the family doctor—now!""

It was Nevin's voice.

Demi froze. Being pregnant, the faint smell of blood made her sick.

Her heart twisted with worry.

What happened? Is he hurt?

She hurried toward the entrance—only to see Nevin rushing in, carrying a woman in his arms. Snow was falling outside, clinging to his hair and coat, but he didn't seem to notice.

Nevin laid the woman on the couch, voice tight with anger. ""Where is the doctor? Get the doctor here, now!""

Demi didn't even have to look at the woman's face to know who she was.

Rhea.

Wrapped in a thick bedrobe, Demi stood aside and asked calmly, ""What happened to her?""

The two had argued that morning, and Nevin barely spared her a glance now. His voice was sharp and cold; he wasn't in the mood to talk.

""She ran into a debt collector. Got stabbed in the shoulder.""

""Debt collector?"" Demi frowned. ""Whose debt?""

She couldn't help but wonder—was the mighty CEO of Blackwell Group in financial trouble now?

Before Nevin could respond, Rhea—her face pale—spoke up weakly. ""I'm sorry, Demi. This is all my fault.""

""My dad owes money from gambling. Somehow those people found out I'm Mr. Blackwell's secretary. They tried to grab me on my way home. I fought back and got hurt. Luckily, Mr. Blackwell was working late and happened to be there. Otherwise, I might've been killed.""

""Cut the crap!"" Nevin interrupted sharply. ""Don't say that. As long as I'm here, no one will hurt you. But your apartment isn't safe anymore. I've called the police. Until they catch the men, you'll stay at my house.""

""No, she can't live here,"" Demi said firmly, without hesitation.

Nevin glanced up at her.

Her face was pale too, but hers was a healthy tone. Maybe because she'd finally quit her job and cleared things up with her friend, she actually looked lighter today.

Demi's cheeks held a soft flush. Her silk robe hung loosely over her frame, soft and elegant, like a lazy Persian cat basking in comfort.

The anger that had been simmering in Nevin all morning suddenly faded when he heard her refusal.

He turned his head slightly, a hint of mockery in his tone.

Of course. Another one of her little games—pretending to be calm while hiding her jealousy of Rhea.

His voice turned cold, and he warned, ""Demi, this is my house.""

He was the man of the house.

Whoever he wanted to keep—stayed.

""Still no,"" Demi replied, her voice sharp and steady.

""There aren't enough rooms. She has nowhere to sleep.""

The villa was huge, three stories tall, but there were only three bedrooms suitable for sleeping.

One for Orion, one for Demi, and one for Nevin. That was it.

When they first married, there had been plenty of guest rooms, but Nevin—full of affection back then—had remodeled them all.

Now the villa had a luxury nursery, a walk-in closet, rooms for her art and yoga, and even a green room.

But no extra bedrooms.

All three bedrooms had once been planned by Nevin—for the son and daughter they hoped to have someday.

Back then, neither of them could've imagined that one day, their marriage would grow so cold that they'd sleep in separate rooms.

He hadn't expected Demi to use that as her reason for refusing Rhea to stay. Nevin's face darkened instantly.

His voice tightened with barely restrained anger. ""Demi, you're sleeping in the master bedroom.""

The meaning was clear. Nevin expected them to share a bed again.

After all, no matter how strained things had become, just three months ago they'd still shared that bed.

How else would the child in her stomach have come to be?

Demi no longer cared about this. That night three months ago had only happened because he was drunk.

There was no love, not even hate, just emptiness.

She stood her ground, refusing to budge. Her silence and defiance made Nevin's anger boil over.

Just then, a small voice broke through the tension. ""Dad? Mom? What's going on?"" Orion came down the stairs, rubbing his sleepy eyes. ""I heard you two fighting again.""

His words trailed off when he saw Rhea on the couch, her arm bandaged and a trace of blood still visible. His drowsiness vanished.

""Rhea!""

He ran to her side immediately. ""What happened? Are you hurt? Does it hurt? Are you okay?""

Rhea smiled softly and patted his head. ""I'm fine, cupcake. Go back to bed.""

""No! You're hurt! I'm not sleeping until you feel better!""

The boy insisted, clinging tightly to Rhea's arm and refusing to let go.

Watching him clutch Rhea so affectionately, Demi let out a smile. ""Don't worry, Orion,"" she said lightly. ""Rhea will be staying with us for a few days. But since we're out of bedrooms, she'll have to share a room with you. Is that okay?""

""Really?!"" Orion's eyes went wide with excitement.

""That's awesome—""

He suddenly covered his mouth mid-sentence.

""Wait—no, Mom! That's not what I meant.""

He'd completely forgotten—Demi hated it when he got too close to Rhea. Once, he'd spent too long playing with Rhea and lost track of time. When he finally came home, Mom was furious.

From that day on, Dad taught him something. Never let your mom know how much you like Rhea or how kind she really is.

""It's fine. You can mean that,"" Demi said darkly.

Her cold hands slipped under her nightgown and rested on her stomach.

Now she finally understood what it meant to give birth to an ingrate.

She still remembered the day Orion was born. Demi had been in labor for two days. The doctors told Nevin they could only save one—her or the baby.

Nevin's eyes had turned red as he shouted outside the operating room, ""Save Demi! Just save her!""

But she refused. Crying and begging through the pain, she asked the doctors to save the baby. She would give up everything but not the child she shared with Nevin.

In the end, she pushed through the pain. Demi gave birth to Orion naturally, without a dose of anesthesia.

She gave up her career and devoted herself completely to raising him.

And what did she get in return? A son who adored another woman and wished he could trade his mother for her.

Demi was exhausted.

Truth was, she hadn't even wanted this new baby. When the test came back positive last week, her first thought was to end it.

Life had already drained every bit of hope from her. She didn't want to give Nevin another child.

But now that she was leaving, a sliver of hope flickered inside of her again.

Without the weight of this family holding her back, maybe she and the baby could start fresh—live free, live better.

Realizing this, Demi decided to stop wasting her time and walked away.

Orion didn't understand why his mom was acting that way. He just stood there, staring blankly as she walked away. For a long time, he didn't move or make a sound. Then, the boy suddenly broke down crying.

Kids were sensitive, even when they didn't understand much.

But somewhere deep inside, through that invisible bond of blood, he felt it. His mother was leaving him for real.

""Waaah—!""

Rhea jumped at the sound, rushing over to comfort him. ""Don't cry, Orion. I'm with you. Don't be scared, okay? I got you.""

She looked up at Nevin, her big tearful eyes full of quiet accusation.

See? Demi made him cry again.

Nevin's face darkened. He glanced up toward the second floor, his gaze cold and heavy. Eventually, he said nothing.    


Chapter 5 I'm Done with This Family


Demi slept soundly through the night. The next morning, she came downstairs, planning to make herself breakfast.

But before she even reached the kitchen, the smell of food filled the air.

It was Rhea. She had already made breakfast for everyone and was now grinding coffee for Nevin by hand.

When Rhea saw Demi, she smiled politely. ""Good morning, Demi. You're up! Come, I made sandwiches. I hope you'll like them.""

""Rhea's cooking is wonderful. Who wouldn't like them?"" Orion chimed in brightly.

Then he sneaked a glance at his mother, his face showing a mix of fear and guilt.

He was scared of his mom, and he hated her a little, too.

Mom seemed so strange lately. Why did she always look at me coldly?

Every time he praised Rhea, Demi used to get upset but would still try harder to please him. That way, he could use her guilt to skip tutoring and have more time to play.

Demi could almost guess what her son was thinking. She gave a small, ironic smile.

Did Orion really think I couldn't see through his little tricks?

Once upon a time, she had hated Rhea because she couldn't accept her husband had a lover.

When it came to Rhea caring for Orion, Demi had always turned a blind eye.

After all, Orion was the eldest grandson. When she gave birth, Erin Blackwell, her mother-in-law, had reminded her countless times never to relax with the boy's education.

Demi had always wanted him to grow up happy. She knew her son was lively and sweet.

He loved comic books, video games, and the outdoors. But as Nevin's wife and the well-known Mrs. Blackwell in high society, she had to appear strict and proper.

Because of this, Orion would often run to his father and complain she was too harsh.

What he didn't know was that Demi had studied every major education system from around the world. She tried her best to balance discipline with play.

On the outside, she looked serious and unkind. But back when Rhea was her intern, Demi had personally drawn a set of storybook manuals and asked her to use them to help Orion learn through play.

Orion's favorite dish—orange-glazed fish—was one Rhea had learned directly from Demi.

Demi never imagined that what she once taught with care would someday cut her like a knife. Her face turned cold, a trace of disbelief and quiet despair in her eyes.

""What are you wearing?"" She asked flatly.

She didn't expect Demi's first words to be that. Rhea hesitated, her voice small and timid.

""I-it's a dress. I didn't have any clean clothes last night, so I just grabbed one from the closet. Demi, what's wrong?""

What's wrong?

A stranger was standing there in her clothes, making coffee for her husband and breakfast for her son. And Rhea had the nerve to ask what was wrong?

Nevin sensed Demi was about to make a scene. He frowned and cut in, ""Demi, it's just a dress. Don't overreact.""

He added, almost impatiently, ""You still have the card I gave you. You can buy a hundred new ones.""

Demi let out a short, bitter laugh.

Her stomach twisted. She wasn't sure if it was from morning sickness or disgust.

""Nevin,"" she said quietly, ""did you forget what that dress was?""

It was the dress she'd worn for their first night together.

Back then, Demi had just graduated—young, curious, and full of dreams.

At a business party, she thought she could help her company land a million-dollar deal. She drank too much trying to impress the clients, only to realize too late that someone had spiked her drink. That night, by accident and fate, she ended up in bed with Nevin.

The next morning, she woke up to find her clothes torn beyond repair. She sat on the edge of the bed, face burning red with embarrassment.

Nevin had found her shy reaction adorable. He sent his assistant to buy her that couture dress and later transferred her to be his personal secretary.

Demi remembered every detail. That dress marked the beginning of everything between them.

Nevin had forgotten all of it. He even let Rhea wear the same thing she once had. It was revolting.

Nevin stared at Demi, trying to read her face. A mocking smile tugged at his lips, and a strange glint flickered in his dark eyes.

""What is it?"" he asked coldly. ""Say it.

""Demi, are you seriously this sentimental over a dress?""

Sensing the tension rising in the room, Rhea hurried forward, grabbing Demi's hand as if frightened.

""Demi, please don't blame Mr. Blackwell,"" Rhea said softly, her voice trembling. ""He didn't know anything. I put it on without asking.

""Mr. Blackwell felt sorry for me that he didn't make me take it off. I didn't realize it bothered you so much.

""I'm so sorry, Demi. I'll change it out now. Please don't be upset!""

Rhea pleaded softly, eyes brimming with tears that threatened to fall at any second.

Demi felt sick. She yanked her hand away. ""It's fine. That dress looks great on you. It's yours now.""

She gave a faint, bitter smile. ""In fact, take whatever you like from my closet. Clothes, shoes—whatever catches your eye, including ... ""

Her gaze lifted to Nevin. She let out a mocking smile.

""Everything I have in this house is yours.""

""Demi!""

Nevin finally lost control at the declaration. He slammed his hand on the table, his voice bursting with anger.

""Do you have to push her into corner?""

Demi laughed faintly, her tone icy. ""I'm not the one doing the pushing here, Nevin. You two are.""

Ring! Ring!

A notification tone cut through the tension. Demi glanced at her phone.

Countdown: 13 days left.

At this rate, she thought, she might not even last until then.

Every day, Nevin managed to push her a little further, testing just how much of her pride she had left.

Today it was a dress. What would it be tomorrow?

Her thoughts froze when she caught a faint scent from Rhea's body—perfume.

Perfume?

The scent was faint at first, almost like natural body fragrance. From a distance, Demi hadn't noticed it, but up close, it was strong and unmistakable.

Her face went pale. Demi had always been sensitive to smells. Her mind flashed to the rule she'd once written in her notebook.

3. He can't stand women who wear perfume.

A bitter laugh rose in her chest. So that's how it is, Nevin.

All your rules disappear the moment she's around?

Demi suddenly laughed, but tears slipped down her cheeks without warning. In that instant, she realized she couldn't wait for the countdown anymore.

She just wanted to leave now.

Her parents were waiting. Her grandfather was waiting. Even her childhood friends were waiting.

So why was she still here? Why was Nevin still standing there, letting another woman humiliate her, letting Rhea trample over the ten best years of her life?

""If you think I'm pushing you,"" Nevin said coldly, ""then get out of my house.""

His eyes were sharp, his voice cutting. Nevin finally exploded.

""All you ever do is sulk around the house like the world owes you something. Demi, didn't you say you wanted a divorce? Fine. Let's do it.""

Demi's chest rose and fell, her voice shaking with emotion. ""Fine! Then let's—""

She didn't finish. Her breath caught as she clutched her chest, face turning red, gasping for air.

Her wide eyes darted toward Rhea in disbelief.

That perfume.

It's a floral scent!

Demi's lips twisted into a faint, broken smile. ""Nevin, if you wanted me dead,"" she spoke hoarsely, ""you could've just said so.""

1oxt5da,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oxt5da,GT7 vs Real Life,"I started playing GT when I was just 5 years old starting with 1 and 2. Eventually my parents bought me a ps2 and got me GT4 with it when I was about 6 or 7. Ever since then I have always loved the photography aspect of GT games. Especially when I was about 11 years old with GT5. Fast forward to GT Sport and GT7 when I was in college I started to really get into the different creative ways to take in game shots. After I graduated, got a little money and bought a nice car I decided I wanted to try photography in real life.

I obviously have a huge passion for cars but specifically in sportscar racing. That obsession and passion started because of GT4 with me discovering and learning about the large varieties of race cars like the pescarolos, Audi GT1s, C5R, etc. etc. and all the different tracks and events across the world. When I bought that camera in real life it was my goal to shoot for a team professionally. After a few years of grinding, waking up early for cars and coffees, going to every car show I could, taking way to many photos of my own car, attending different IMSA, WEC, and NASCAR races, networking, taking hundreds of thousands of photos, and countless hours editing and posting i finally was able to get the lucky chance to shoot for an actual team. They flew me out for a few races, got me media credentials, and made me apart of the team.

As an homage to Gran Turismo I wanted to recreate some of the photos I took at Petit Le Mans last year and post the comparison here. I still think it’s crazy how accurate GT is to real life and how accurate the photo mode is.

Huge shoutout to the Forte Racing crew. Although the season didn’t end or go the way they wanted, everyone of those guys worked their asses off and were great to be around. Can’t thank the enough.

My IG is @chrisxjohnstonx if you would like to follow along the photo journeys I go on.

Also yes these were taken on PS4 (I only play GT7 so no need to get a PS5 just for that. And also camera gear and car parts are very expensive too 😝) and of course the car actually being races is the EVO2 and GT just has the original Huracan GT3.

TL/DR: GT photo mode inspired me to take photos and I worked my way up to shoot for a real race team. ",109,1763217118.0,granturismo,7,0.98,False

Coffee amount: 17g

Pressure: around 10 bar

Time: (with pre-infiusion 3s : 3s): 34s

Final amount of coffee: 66g



Now, I really want to reduce the final amount of coffee to a ratio of around 1:2.5; however I have a ratio of 1:3.9 now. I know, I can reduce the time, but it was advised to me to aim for around 30s using this certain coffee. Since the pressure is already quite high, I was wondering, is there any way how I can make sure the flow rate is a little slower?

""Sweetheart, have you thought about what we talked about last time? Your grandfather's health is getting worse. You're our only daughter. Don't you want to come home and take over the company?""

In the quiet room, Demi Snow held a paintbrush while listening to her mother's worn voice on the phone.

The dim light cast a soft glow over her canvas as she drew the final stroke of a family of three.

Carol Snow thought this was another failed attempt. But unexpectedly, Demi spoke softly, ""Okay.""

Carol froze for a moment, surprised. ""Y-you agreed?""

""Yes,"" Demi said calmly. ""I'll come home. I just need some time to finish things here. I'll be home within two weeks.""

After exchanging a few more words, Demi ended the call.

She walked out of her studio and looked down from the staircase into the living room. Three people sat there.

Her gaze lingered on the man sitting on the couch.

He had sharp, handsome features—deep-set eyes, clean lines, and a quiet, serious aura. His shirt was buttoned all the way up, his dress pants crisp and perfect. Everything about him screamed control and elegance.

That was her husband, Nevin Blackwell, the man she had chosen against her family's wishes. She once believed Nevin was worth giving up everything for.

Nevin was known for his cold, distant manner. People in his circle called him the Ice Prince. But right now, he was smiling softly at another woman.

Nearby, a six-year-old boy with bright eyes ran into the woman's arms. ""Rhea, can you make me some orange-glazed fish? Please?""

Rhea Dunn touched his nose affectionately and smiled. ""Of course, cupcake.""

Orion Blackwell's eyes lit up with joy. ""You're the best! You're different than my mom; she never lets me eat what I want.""

He pouted after saying that.

Rhea smiled and said gently, ""Then you should eat a little more today.""

Orion nodded, his face bright with a sweet grin. ""Rhea, you're so nice. I wish you were my real mom.""

Rhea's smile deepened.

Upstairs, Demi's heart ached painfully.

She knew Orion could get greedy with food. Demi limited his portions because she didn't want his stomach to hurt later.

But watching them now—her husband, her son, and that woman—they looked like a real family. She was the one left out.

Demi went back to her room.

A few minutes later, footsteps sounded outside.

The door opened. Rhea walked in, her makeup flawless, her expression soft and gentle. ""Demi,"" she said sweetly, ""let's go downstairs and celebrate Orion's birthday together.""

Rhea used to be her intern. She'd come from a poor family and had just enough skill to get by. Demi still remembered the day Rhea broke down in her office, crying that if she couldn't find a job soon, she'd have to marry some guy back home.

Demi had taken pity on her and brought her into the company.

Who could've guessed she'd end up inviting a snake into her home?

Rhea copied everything Demi did—her style, her voice, and even how she spoke to Nevin. By the time Demi realized it, Rhea was already part of their home, close to both her husband and her son.

Demi had long seen through her act. She hated herself for letting a snake into the house.

""I'm not feeling well,"" she said coldly. ""I'll pass.""

Rhea put on her best innocent act. ""Demi, you're his mom. Orion needs your blessing today.""

Demi frowned, ready to refuse again, but then stopped. She sighed.

This is between me and Rhea. Orion shouldn't suffer because of it.

As his mother, I owe him my presence on his birthday.

Demi put down her paintbrush, brushed past Rhea, and headed downstairs.

For a second, Rhea's smile stiffened. A flash of malice crossed her eyes before she followed.

When Demi saw Nevin and Orion together, she froze.

Ten years ago, she joined Blackwell Group to gain experience and met Nevin there. They fought, laughed, and somehow fell in love. Against her family's wishes, she married him. Demi even cut ties with them because of it.

For the past decade, Demi never once regretted her choice. She had a rich, handsome husband who treated her well and a smart, adorable child.

She thought her life was perfect until Rhea showed up.

Demi watched as Rhea smiled sweetly, serving food for Nevin and Orion.

Rhea's arrival had shattered everything that once felt beautiful.

Demi picked up her fork, ready to eat, but suddenly felt a wave of nausea.

She set it down quickly and ran to the restroom, retching over the sink.

Nevin looked worried and started to follow her, but Rhea stopped him. Her eyes filled with concern.

""Mr. Blackwell, what's wrong with Demi?"" she asked anxiously.

Nevin comforted gently. ""She's been doing this lately. It's nothing; don't worry.""

Then he turned toward the restroom and mocked coldly, ""What's your excuse this time? Did you catch a cold? Or is the food not good enough again?""

Demi said nothing. She wiped the corner of her mouth with a tissue.

If she told them she was pregnant, would anyone believe her?

Forget it. She was already planning to leave. Why should she tell them?

There's no point in ruining the sweet moment between her husband and that homewrecker.

Rhea was a secretary, but she had the nerve to scold her boss. ""Mr. Blackwell, don't talk like that. Maybe she really doesn't feel well. She's lost so much weight lately.""

She stood up, poured a cup of hot tea, and handed it to Demi.

""Are you okay? Here, drink some tea.""

The sight of her disgusting face made Demi feel even sicker. Irritated, she pushed her hand away.

She hadn't used much force, but Rhea stumbled slightly. Somehow, the water spilled on Rhea's hand.

""Ouch!"" Rhea cried out in pain.

""Rhea!""

""Rhea!""

Nevin and Orion rushed over at the same time. The father and son stared at Rhea's red, scalded hand with panic and concern.

Her fair skin had turned bright red from the burn.

Tears filled Orion's eyes as he looked at Rhea. ""Does it hurt a lot?"" The boy asked softly, his voice trembling with worry.

Rhea forced a smile, pretending to be strong. ""It's okay, Orion. I wasn't careful. It doesn't hurt.""

Nevin turned toward Demi, his eyes burning with anger.

His voice was cold as ice. ""What trouble are you trying to cause this time?""

Demi's heart twisted in pain. She caught Rhea's smug look, then saw her son standing protectively in front of her. Hopelessness washed over her, and she closed her eyes.

""I didn't do anything,"" she said quietly.

But of course, Nevin didn't believe her.

When the family doctor arrived, Nevin helped Rhea sit up, letting her lean against his chest. His dark eyes were filled with disappointment.

""Demi, you've changed. The woman I knew would never do something like this out of jealousy.""

Changed?

Yes. She had changed.

Ten years ago, she wouldn't have had a stomach full of stretch marks from giving birth. She wouldn't have dull skin from sleepless nights.

And she wouldn't have given up her career to cook and clean for a man, only to be replaced by someone new.

Demi suddenly felt exhausted. She swallowed her explanation and went upstairs.

Before entering her room, she looked back one last time. The living room was chaos, but in the middle of it stood her husband and son, both surrounding Rhea with concern, like a perfect little family.

Demi smiled bitterly and shook her head. Gently, she placed a hand on her stomach and set a countdown to her departure on her phone.

Then she walked into her room without hesitation.

From that moment on, she promised herself she would never disturb them again.            


Chapter 2 I'm Done Playing This Ridiculous Game


The noise outside slowly faded away. Demi didn't care what was going on. She just put on her earplugs and eye mask and slept until morning.

She'd decided to go home and took over the family business. That meant she had to quit her job here.

Since giving birth to Orion, she had rarely appeared at the company. But back when Nevin took over the Blackwell Group, she was right there beside him, helping build everything step by step.

Blackwell Group wouldn't have become the country's top firm without her.

So even though she hadn't worked in the office for years, she still received a large annual bonus and dividends.

Early that morning, Demi stared at her reflection in the mirror. Her long wavy brown hair framed a delicate face, but her pretty charming eyes carried no trace of a smile.

She was beautiful. No one could deny that. Even after years as a stay-at-home wife, all the exhaustion and stress hadn't taken away her charm.

But the emotional abuse at home and the stress of pregnancy had drained the light from her eyes, making them look lifeless and dull now.

At the top floor of Blackwell Group, Demi was waiting for her resignation papers to be printed.

Behind her, she overheard a few employees chatting.

""Did you see Rhea's Instagram?""

""Not yet. What did she post this time?""

""Plenty. Looks like she was celebrating someone's birthday. You've got to see it.""

They laughed, but when they looked up and saw Demi standing there, their smiles froze.

""Uh—M-Ms. Snow?""

""Ms. Snow, you're back at the office?""

Demi gave them a polite nod. They quickly murmured a goodbye and rushed off.

As they disappeared down the hall, she could still hear them whispering.

""Ugh, what bad luck. Why's Demi here?""

""She's already married Mr. Blackwell. Why show off in front of us?""

""Please, I bet she and Mr. Blackwell aren't doing great. Wouldn't be surprised if they're getting divorced.""

Demi wasn't bothered with this. She was used to this kind of talk. Her coworkers had never liked her much.

If it hadn't been for all the office bullying she faced early on and Nevin stepping in to help, she probably would've never fallen for him.

Bored from waiting, she unlocked her phone and opened Instagram.

The first thing she saw was Rhea's new post. A collage of nine pictures.

The first one was from Orion's birthday party last night, lavishly decorated with balloons and a huge three-layer cake right in the center.

But what caught Demi's eye was a hospital photo. Three hands of different sizes stacked together. It looked warm and cozy.

A trip to the hospital again? Just for a burn?

Demi let out a dry laugh and scrolled through the comments. They were all full of envy and well wishes.

[Wow! A birthday party for the little one? So sweet!]

[Another lovey-dovey post! Who's your mystery man, girl? Show us already]

[Doesn't matter what happens—as long as the family's together, that's happiness.]

The comments went on and on.

She knew exactly what Rhea was doing. Rhea was trying to get under her skin, trying to make her lose control, run to Nevin, and demand answers.

Once upon a time, that would've worked. She couldn't stand seeing that fake sweetness or how her husband and son would rather be with a woman who copied her every move.

But now? She was leaving soon. None of it mattered anymore.

Demi let out a faint smile and tapped the little red heart beneath the post.

A moment later, with her resignation letter in hand, Demi went straight to the CEO's office and handed it to Nevin's personal assistant.

The people in the secretary department were whispering behind her back, mocking her for showing off at the office as if she owned the place. But the moment they saw the resignation letter, the room went silent. Then someone gasped.

""""What—wait, am I seeing this right?!""

""Ms. Snow is resigning?!""

The assistant froze, panic flashing across her face. ""Mr. Blackwell is in an important meeting. Maybe we should wait until he's done—""

""Don't bother,"" Demi said with a calm smile. ""I'm just the chief of secretary in name only, remember? You have the authority to process it. No need to trouble him.""

People around whispered in low voices. ""Could the rumors be true? Did Demi and Mr. Blackwell break up? Is Ms. Dunn turning out to be a homewrecker?""

""Why did you assume it's Ms. Dunn? Isn't she married?""

""You're clueless. Did you see that hand on Instagram? That Rolex costs a fortune. No one in all of Yraka could afford it except Mr. Blackwell.""

""Exactly. Didn't you notice that Ms. Dunn took over all Ms. Snow's work after she went on maternity leave?""

""And now that she's quitting, maybe it's because she's stepping aside for good!""

Demi could hear every word of it. They'd always loved gossiping. In the past, she would've been crushed, hiding under the covers and crying into her pillow.

But now? She suddenly realized none of it mattered anymore.

She smiled at everyone as if she hadn't heard a thing, bowed politely, and said, ""Thank you all for your hard work over the past ten years. I hope Blackwell Group continues to grow and thrive.""

The office fell silent. No one knew what to say. Demi walked back to her desk and began packing up her things.

After ten years, her workspace was filled to the brim. Ten years' worth of memories were stacked neatly in front of her—books she bought when she first joined, binders filled with notes, and her old planner from when she became Nevin's secretary.

Flipping it open, she saw her handwriting still crisp and clear.

""1. He drinks a cup of hand-ground coffee every morning.""

""2. He hates people being late.""

""3. He can't stand women who wear perfume.""

Page after page was filled with small details about him—his habits, his preferences, and his temper. Every line represented her dedication.

Only God knew what Demi had gone through to be a good secretary. People always thought being a secretary was easy, that it just meant being pretty and pleasing a man with their body. They had no idea how wrong they were.

Nevin was the only one who'd ever seen the truth. He'd seen her stay late night after night, reading contracts until her eyes hurt, building presentations from scratch, and researching every single competitor the company ever had. She could list every company's data and performance by heart.

It was because of her relentless effort that the untouchable Ice Prince of the Blackwell family finally stepped down from his pedestal and became the man everyone admired today.

Demi once believed Nevin understood her better than anyone else in the world. She thought their bond went deeper than love, that they shared the same dream, the same fight. She was wrong.

Ten years of devotion, ten years of struggle and love—all of it had turned into nothing but ashes.

Demi quietly focused on cleaning up her desk when the meeting ended. Rhea was the first to step out.

She looked quite cheerful at first, but the moment she saw Demi, her smile froze.

What is she doing here?

Did Demi see the post on Instagram? Is she here to confront me?

Rhea grew excited just thinking about it. She couldn't sit still as she went back to her desk, waiting nervously for the storm to hit.

She lowered her head, eyes red, looking like she'd just been terribly wronged.

Nevin was the last to leave the conference room. As he passed the secretary department, he noticed Demi sitting there.

Her desk was the closest to his office—a symbol of trust and affection back in the days when they were still in love.

But now, just the sight of her made him irritated.

What made it worse was how cheerful she looked. Demi was flipping through a book with a small smile on her face.

Across from her, Rhea sat miserably, dabbing her tears with a tissue.

Nevin frowned.

He tapped the edge of Demi's desk and said coldly, ""Come in.""

Demi looked up, her expression composed. ""Okay,"" she replied simply.

The moment she stepped into his office, his voice turned icy.

""The company doesn't need you here anymore. Unless there's something important, don't show up in the office again.""            


Chapter 3 I Quit, Mr. Blackwell


Demi froze. No matter how many times Nevin had disappointed her, his cold voice still pierced her heart like a needle.

Her smile faded. ""Alright,"" she said quietly, eyes downcast.

Nevin had expected Demi to fight back, maybe even yell. But her calm obedience caught him off guard. For the first time, he really looked at her.

Rhea was right. Demi had lost a lot of weight lately.

Maybe her nausea last night wasn't a jealous act after all.

Nevin pressed his lips together, his tone softening a little. ""Ms. Dunn is doing great at her job. Your only duty now is to take care of Orion.""

Then his voice turned sharp again. ""I've told you many times—there's nothing going on between me and her. Demi, stop being dramatic. Don't make me regret choosing you as my wife.""

Regret?

She smiled bitterly. If anyone regretted it, it was her. She had given up her family business and traded it for this hollow title as his wife.

Demi came from a prestigious family. Wouldn't it be better to go back and live as the beloved heiress of the Snow Group, adored and protected by everyone?

Closing her eyes, Demi pulled out an envelope and handed it to him. Her tone was polite but distant. ""Mr. Blackwell, please approve my resignation. Starting tomorrow, I'll officially leave the company.""

She turned to leave, but just as she reached the door, Nevin grabbed her arm.

""Demi?""

His voice carried surprise, as if he hadn't processed what just happened.

Nevin glanced down at the resignation letter in his hand, her signature printed clearly in black ink. His face darkened, anger flickering in his eyes.

""You're doing this out of spite?"" he demanded.

""I thought you came here to make peace, but you're just making it worse?""

Demi kept her gaze low, her long lashes trembling slightly.

""No, Mr. Blackwell,"" she said calmly. ""You said the company doesn't need me. Turns out, I feel the same way.""

""Ten years have passed. This company isn't what it used to be,"" Demi said calmly. ""Since everyone seems to adore Ms. Dunn, there's no point in me sitting around collecting a paycheck. I'd rather step down and make room for her.""

Nevin let out a cold laugh. His eyes were sharp as blades, cutting straight through her words.

""Don't use these ten years to guilt-trip me. I know how much you've done for this company. You were a good employee once. But Demi, ever since you gave birth, you haven't been involved in business at all. I've been patient with you.""

He leaned closer, his tone low and dismissive. ""As long as you take care of our child, you'll always be the lady of the household. That's all I've ever asked, but you couldn't even manage that.""

Nevin's voice grew harsher. ""And now you want to step down gracefully? You just want to throw Rhea into the spotlight and make her take the blame. Demi, I know you too well. You're full of scheme, but I'm warning you don't be so vicious.""

He paused, his voice dripping with sarcasm. ""Have you even apologized to Rhea for the incident happened last night?""

Apologize?

To the homewrecker destroyed my family?

Shouldn't Rhea be the one who owed me a thank you?

Demi suddenly laughed, the sound soft but cutting. She tilted her head, looking at him with calm curiosity. ""You're right. I'm vicious. But tell me, Mr. Blackwell, have you ever thought about giving up the appearance?""

By giving up meant divorce.

They'd fought about it many times over the years. Every argument ended the same way—no resolution, just silence.

Nevin would never agree. Even if he cheated, Demi was still his wife.

That was the kind of man Nevin was—controlling, arrogant, and born to dominate.

At first, Demi didn't really want to leave. She just wanted him to look at her again, to remember she was there.

But now, she was tired.

A clean break, each walked their own ways.

Each of them had a child. That didn't sound so bad anymore.

Nevin's expression darkened like a storm. He grabbed her arm so hard it hurt, his grip full of rage.

""This is your last chance, Demi. If you keep failing, I'll have to find Orion a new mother.""

He didn't stop there. ""Do you know how many times Orion's told me he's miserable with you? No fun. No freedom. Nothing.""

His voice turned to ice. ""Why do you fail at everything—as a wife and as a mother?""

Failure.

Demi closed her eyes and let out a long, shaky breath.

So that's how it was.

All those nights she stayed up waiting for him, making him warm lemon tea after his drinking session was a failure.

The times she hand-washed his couture suits and got frostbite in the dead of winter—failure.

Even teaching their son advanced math to meet the high standards of being a heir of the Blackwells—still a failure.

There was no place left for her in this house.

""I'm sorry, Mr. Blackwell,"" she said quietly.

Her tone was calm, sincere.

A loser should know when to take her final bow.

Her other hand slipped into her pocket. She opened her phone and tapped the screen.

A countdown started—another 14 days to go.

When it hit zero, she would be gone. Completely. No more arguments, no more tears, no more bothering Nevin with her existence.

Her calmness caught him off guard.

Nevin wanted to say something—anything—but Demi didn't give him the chance.

She walked away resolutely. Nevin reached out to stop her, but his hand closed on nothing but air.

A sharp pain clenched his chest as he watched her go, a strange panic building inside him.

Nevin frowned, watching Demi walk away. It felt like something important, something he couldn't name was slipping further and further from him.

Once she stepped outside, Demi pulled out her phone and made a call to her best friend, Phoebe Lennon.

They used to be best friends, but they hadn't spoken in seven years.

Phoebe was a fashion designer who practically lived on airplanes, traveling across the country to tailor clothes for models.

Some were male, some female. Well, things sometimes happened between adults who worked that closely.

To put it simply, Phoebe changed boyfriends as easily as changing outfits. Nevin couldn't stand that about her. After Demi gave birth to Orion, he told her to stay away from Phoebe, worried she'd be a bad influence and corrupted their son.

And Demi listened. She actually listened. For six whole years, she cut off her oldest friend, just because her husband said so.

It had been a long time since Phoebe last heard from Demi. The moment she picked up, her voice was sharp with anger. ""So you finally remembered me! I thought you'd completely lost your mind over that man. What happened? Regret finally hit you?""

Demi couldn't help but laugh through her tears.

Nevin's insults hadn't made her cry. Rhea's tricks hadn't made her cry. Even watching her son calling another woman mother hadn't broken her.

But hearing Phoebe's voice did. For the first time, she cried from regret.

""Yes,"" she admitted. ""I regret it. Phoebe, Is it too late to come back to you now?""

Hearing Demi's sincere voice, there was a long pause on the other end. When Phoebe finally spoke again, her voice was trembling with tears too.

""It's never too late. You finally came to your senses. You idiot, do you know how hard it's been running the studio without you all these years?""

Her tone turned fierce again, full of emotion. ""The entire art world's been waiting for you! Demi, being a corporate secretary is a waste of your gift. You were born to hold a brush—you're the greatest painter of our time, the last jewel of the Impressionists. I've been waiting for you.""

""I'm sorry, Phoebe. I'm so sorry.""

Standing on the busy street, Demi crouched down and sobbed.

She should've never forgotten who she was. She used to be so proud.

Born gifted, brilliant, and proud—Nevin never even knew that Demi had studied fine arts overseas.

Her graduation piece had been selected for the Janbus International Art Exhibition, shocking the art world.

After that, her paintings sold for seven-figure prices at auction.

And yet, she'd walked away from all of it. For the sake of living experience, she had taken a regular office job, learned administration, finance, and management and still excelled.

After ten long years away from her canvas, she decided she was done hiding. She was going home—to art, to herself.             


Chapter 4 I'm Done with This Ungrateful Brat


After setting a date with Phoebe to hand over the studio, Demi went home.

She gave herself two weeks. Ten years was such a long time. There were too many loose ends to tie up before she could walk away for good.

The biggest issue at hand was the household itself.

The huge 5,000-square-foot villa didn't have a single helper because Nevin complained they were noisy.

So, Demi handled every bit of cleaning herself.

If she was going to leave, she wanted to do it gracefully—like a professional, like the perfect secretary she'd always been. That was her pride as the heiress of the Snows.

Rhea, of course, wasn't the type to do chores. Demi decided to find a good maid for her husband and son.

All day, she interviewed candidates. She asked them to cook soups the way Nevin liked them. That night, while Demi was having dinner, a panicked shout came from the door.

""Bill! Call the family doctor—now!""

It was Nevin's voice.

Demi froze. Being pregnant, the faint smell of blood made her sick.

Her heart twisted with worry.

What happened? Is he hurt?

She hurried toward the entrance—only to see Nevin rushing in, carrying a woman in his arms. Snow was falling outside, clinging to his hair and coat, but he didn't seem to notice.

Nevin laid the woman on the couch, voice tight with anger. ""Where is the doctor? Get the doctor here, now!""

Demi didn't even have to look at the woman's face to know who she was.

Rhea.

Wrapped in a thick bedrobe, Demi stood aside and asked calmly, ""What happened to her?""

The two had argued that morning, and Nevin barely spared her a glance now. His voice was sharp and cold; he wasn't in the mood to talk.

""She ran into a debt collector. Got stabbed in the shoulder.""

""Debt collector?"" Demi frowned. ""Whose debt?""

She couldn't help but wonder—was the mighty CEO of Blackwell Group in financial trouble now?

Before Nevin could respond, Rhea—her face pale—spoke up weakly. ""I'm sorry, Demi. This is all my fault.""

""My dad owes money from gambling. Somehow those people found out I'm Mr. Blackwell's secretary. They tried to grab me on my way home. I fought back and got hurt. Luckily, Mr. Blackwell was working late and happened to be there. Otherwise, I might've been killed.""

""Cut the crap!"" Nevin interrupted sharply. ""Don't say that. As long as I'm here, no one will hurt you. But your apartment isn't safe anymore. I've called the police. Until they catch the men, you'll stay at my house.""

""No, she can't live here,"" Demi said firmly, without hesitation.

Nevin glanced up at her.

Her face was pale too, but hers was a healthy tone. Maybe because she'd finally quit her job and cleared things up with her friend, she actually looked lighter today.

Demi's cheeks held a soft flush. Her silk robe hung loosely over her frame, soft and elegant, like a lazy Persian cat basking in comfort.

The anger that had been simmering in Nevin all morning suddenly faded when he heard her refusal.

He turned his head slightly, a hint of mockery in his tone.

Of course. Another one of her little games—pretending to be calm while hiding her jealousy of Rhea.

His voice turned cold, and he warned, ""Demi, this is my house.""

He was the man of the house.

Whoever he wanted to keep—stayed.

""Still no,"" Demi replied, her voice sharp and steady.

""There aren't enough rooms. She has nowhere to sleep.""

The villa was huge, three stories tall, but there were only three bedrooms suitable for sleeping.

One for Orion, one for Demi, and one for Nevin. That was it.

When they first married, there had been plenty of guest rooms, but Nevin—full of affection back then—had remodeled them all.

Now the villa had a luxury nursery, a walk-in closet, rooms for her art and yoga, and even a green room.

But no extra bedrooms.

All three bedrooms had once been planned by Nevin—for the son and daughter they hoped to have someday.

Back then, neither of them could've imagined that one day, their marriage would grow so cold that they'd sleep in separate rooms.

He hadn't expected Demi to use that as her reason for refusing Rhea to stay. Nevin's face darkened instantly.

His voice tightened with barely restrained anger. ""Demi, you're sleeping in the master bedroom.""

The meaning was clear. Nevin expected them to share a bed again.

After all, no matter how strained things had become, just three months ago they'd still shared that bed.

How else would the child in her stomach have come to be?

Demi no longer cared about this. That night three months ago had only happened because he was drunk.

There was no love, not even hate, just emptiness.

She stood her ground, refusing to budge. Her silence and defiance made Nevin's anger boil over.

Just then, a small voice broke through the tension. ""Dad? Mom? What's going on?"" Orion came down the stairs, rubbing his sleepy eyes. ""I heard you two fighting again.""

His words trailed off when he saw Rhea on the couch, her arm bandaged and a trace of blood still visible. His drowsiness vanished.

""Rhea!""

He ran to her side immediately. ""What happened? Are you hurt? Does it hurt? Are you okay?""

Rhea smiled softly and patted his head. ""I'm fine, cupcake. Go back to bed.""

""No! You're hurt! I'm not sleeping until you feel better!""

The boy insisted, clinging tightly to Rhea's arm and refusing to let go.

Watching him clutch Rhea so affectionately, Demi let out a smile. ""Don't worry, Orion,"" she said lightly. ""Rhea will be staying with us for a few days. But since we're out of bedrooms, she'll have to share a room with you. Is that okay?""

""Really?!"" Orion's eyes went wide with excitement.

""That's awesome—""

He suddenly covered his mouth mid-sentence.

""Wait—no, Mom! That's not what I meant.""

He'd completely forgotten—Demi hated it when he got too close to Rhea. Once, he'd spent too long playing with Rhea and lost track of time. When he finally came home, Mom was furious.

From that day on, Dad taught him something. Never let your mom know how much you like Rhea or how kind she really is.

""It's fine. You can mean that,"" Demi said darkly.

Her cold hands slipped under her nightgown and rested on her stomach.

Now she finally understood what it meant to give birth to an ingrate.

She still remembered the day Orion was born. Demi had been in labor for two days. The doctors told Nevin they could only save one—her or the baby.

Nevin's eyes had turned red as he shouted outside the operating room, ""Save Demi! Just save her!""

But she refused. Crying and begging through the pain, she asked the doctors to save the baby. She would give up everything but not the child she shared with Nevin.

In the end, she pushed through the pain. Demi gave birth to Orion naturally, without a dose of anesthesia.

She gave up her career and devoted herself completely to raising him.

And what did she get in return? A son who adored another woman and wished he could trade his mother for her.

Demi was exhausted.

Truth was, she hadn't even wanted this new baby. When the test came back positive last week, her first thought was to end it.

Life had already drained every bit of hope from her. She didn't want to give Nevin another child.

But now that she was leaving, a sliver of hope flickered inside of her again.

Without the weight of this family holding her back, maybe she and the baby could start fresh—live free, live better.

Realizing this, Demi decided to stop wasting her time and walked away.

Orion didn't understand why his mom was acting that way. He just stood there, staring blankly as she walked away. For a long time, he didn't move or make a sound. Then, the boy suddenly broke down crying.

Kids were sensitive, even when they didn't understand much.

But somewhere deep inside, through that invisible bond of blood, he felt it. His mother was leaving him for real.

""Waaah—!""

Rhea jumped at the sound, rushing over to comfort him. ""Don't cry, Orion. I'm with you. Don't be scared, okay? I got you.""

She looked up at Nevin, her big tearful eyes full of quiet accusation.

See? Demi made him cry again.

Nevin's face darkened. He glanced up toward the second floor, his gaze cold and heavy. Eventually, he said nothing.    


Chapter 5 I'm Done with This Family


Demi slept soundly through the night. The next morning, she came downstairs, planning to make herself breakfast.

But before she even reached the kitchen, the smell of food filled the air.

It was Rhea. She had already made breakfast for everyone and was now grinding coffee for Nevin by hand.

When Rhea saw Demi, she smiled politely. ""Good morning, Demi. You're up! Come, I made sandwiches. I hope you'll like them.""

""Rhea's cooking is wonderful. Who wouldn't like them?"" Orion chimed in brightly.

Then he sneaked a glance at his mother, his face showing a mix of fear and guilt.

He was scared of his mom, and he hated her a little, too.

Mom seemed so strange lately. Why did she always look at me coldly?

Every time he praised Rhea, Demi used to get upset but would still try harder to please him. That way, he could use her guilt to skip tutoring and have more time to play.

Demi could almost guess what her son was thinking. She gave a small, ironic smile.

Did Orion really think I couldn't see through his little tricks?

Once upon a time, she had hated Rhea because she couldn't accept her husband had a lover.

When it came to Rhea caring for Orion, Demi had always turned a blind eye.

After all, Orion was the eldest grandson. When she gave birth, Erin Blackwell, her mother-in-law, had reminded her countless times never to relax with the boy's education.

Demi had always wanted him to grow up happy. She knew her son was lively and sweet.

He loved comic books, video games, and the outdoors. But as Nevin's wife and the well-known Mrs. Blackwell in high society, she had to appear strict and proper.

Because of this, Orion would often run to his father and complain she was too harsh.

What he didn't know was that Demi had studied every major education system from around the world. She tried her best to balance discipline with play.

On the outside, she looked serious and unkind. But back when Rhea was her intern, Demi had personally drawn a set of storybook manuals and asked her to use them to help Orion learn through play.

Orion's favorite dish—orange-glazed fish—was one Rhea had learned directly from Demi.

Demi never imagined that what she once taught with care would someday cut her like a knife. Her face turned cold, a trace of disbelief and quiet despair in her eyes.

""What are you wearing?"" She asked flatly.

She didn't expect Demi's first words to be that. Rhea hesitated, her voice small and timid.

""I-it's a dress. I didn't have any clean clothes last night, so I just grabbed one from the closet. Demi, what's wrong?""

What's wrong?

A stranger was standing there in her clothes, making coffee for her husband and breakfast for her son. And Rhea had the nerve to ask what was wrong?

Nevin sensed Demi was about to make a scene. He frowned and cut in, ""Demi, it's just a dress. Don't overreact.""

He added, almost impatiently, ""You still have the card I gave you. You can buy a hundred new ones.""

Demi let out a short, bitter laugh.

Her stomach twisted. She wasn't sure if it was from morning sickness or disgust.

""Nevin,"" she said quietly, ""did you forget what that dress was?""

It was the dress she'd worn for their first night together.

Back then, Demi had just graduated—young, curious, and full of dreams.

At a business party, she thought she could help her company land a million-dollar deal. She drank too much trying to impress the clients, only to realize too late that someone had spiked her drink. That night, by accident and fate, she ended up in bed with Nevin.

The next morning, she woke up to find her clothes torn beyond repair. She sat on the edge of the bed, face burning red with embarrassment.

Nevin had found her shy reaction adorable. He sent his assistant to buy her that couture dress and later transferred her to be his personal secretary.

Demi remembered every detail. That dress marked the beginning of everything between them.

Nevin had forgotten all of it. He even let Rhea wear the same thing she once had. It was revolting.

Nevin stared at Demi, trying to read her face. A mocking smile tugged at his lips, and a strange glint flickered in his dark eyes.

""What is it?"" he asked coldly. ""Say it.

""Demi, are you seriously this sentimental over a dress?""

Sensing the tension rising in the room, Rhea hurried forward, grabbing Demi's hand as if frightened.

""Demi, please don't blame Mr. Blackwell,"" Rhea said softly, her voice trembling. ""He didn't know anything. I put it on without asking.

""Mr. Blackwell felt sorry for me that he didn't make me take it off. I didn't realize it bothered you so much.

""I'm so sorry, Demi. I'll change it out now. Please don't be upset!""

Rhea pleaded softly, eyes brimming with tears that threatened to fall at any second.

Demi felt sick. She yanked her hand away. ""It's fine. That dress looks great on you. It's yours now.""

She gave a faint, bitter smile. ""In fact, take whatever you like from my closet. Clothes, shoes—whatever catches your eye, including ... ""

Her gaze lifted to Nevin. She let out a mocking smile.

""Everything I have in this house is yours.""

""Demi!""

Nevin finally lost control at the declaration. He slammed his hand on the table, his voice bursting with anger.

""Do you have to push her into corner?""

Demi laughed faintly, her tone icy. ""I'm not the one doing the pushing here, Nevin. You two are.""

Ring! Ring!

A notification tone cut through the tension. Demi glanced at her phone.

Countdown: 13 days left.

At this rate, she thought, she might not even last until then.

Every day, Nevin managed to push her a little further, testing just how much of her pride she had left.

Today it was a dress. What would it be tomorrow?

Her thoughts froze when she caught a faint scent from Rhea's body—perfume.

Perfume?

The scent was faint at first, almost like natural body fragrance. From a distance, Demi hadn't noticed it, but up close, it was strong and unmistakable.

Her face went pale. Demi had always been sensitive to smells. Her mind flashed to the rule she'd once written in her notebook.

3. He can't stand women who wear perfume.

A bitter laugh rose in her chest. So that's how it is, Nevin.

All your rules disappear the moment she's around?

Demi suddenly laughed, but tears slipped down her cheeks without warning. In that instant, she realized she couldn't wait for the countdown anymore.

She just wanted to leave now.

Her parents were waiting. Her grandfather was waiting. Even her childhood friends were waiting.

So why was she still here? Why was Nevin still standing there, letting another woman humiliate her, letting Rhea trample over the ten best years of her life?

""If you think I'm pushing you,"" Nevin said coldly, ""then get out of my house.""

His eyes were sharp, his voice cutting. Nevin finally exploded.

""All you ever do is sulk around the house like the world owes you something. Demi, didn't you say you wanted a divorce? Fine. Let's do it.""

Demi's chest rose and fell, her voice shaking with emotion. ""Fine! Then let's—""

She didn't finish. Her breath caught as she clutched her chest, face turning red, gasping for air.

Her wide eyes darted toward Rhea in disbelief.

That perfume.

It's a floral scent!

Demi's lips twisted into a faint, broken smile. ""Nevin, if you wanted me dead,"" she spoke hoarsely, ""you could've just said so.""

I’m a 35F and I broke up with 43M. We were dating for over two years. We were seeing each other casually and then my job moved me out of the city we were in. We decided to do long distance for that year and 4 months. While doing the long distance thing I would come down every weekend to see him. He has kids so every other weekend they were with him. During that time we did have disagreements but we managed to work them out. Flash forward I moved back in August and it was so great! We spent every moment together. We had so much fun and enjoyed being together. In the middle of September his job sent him to another state for work. He decided that he would fly out Sunday and return Thursdays (I would pick him up and drop him off) to spend time with his kids. Since starting this new schedule and him being gone our relationship started to get rocky. I felt that when he was here he was constantly tired or stressed. I even felt that he didn’t even want to be home. We had started to fight more and it started taking a toll. About four weeks to five weeks ago him and I were talking and I told him that I’d really like a date night with just him and I so we can work on our connection because since his new schedule all the time he’s back the kids are around and he’s in dad mode. I also asked if he could work on completing me more while away because he would do it when he’s home but mainly when we were intimate. He said okay and we did dinners for that first two weeks. The last week or so for me were extremely important for my own personal development. I was taking an extremely important test. Last week after I took the test he told me that we can get dinner to celebrate but we only have like 1.5 to 2 hours so it will be quick. We went to dinner and we had so much fun. We talked and laughed like the best friends we were. Well this last week before he came home we got into a disagreement again because I calmly told him that I’m not feeling loved by him lately. Because the things I asked for to strengthen my connection with him stopped. He got upset and gave me a list of things he does to show that he loves me (I talk to you on that phone every day, I text you good morning, I spend my time with you when I’m home) and he then hung up the phone (which is typical behavior when I express emotions he’s done this pretty often). I was upset and went to bed. The next morning he text me a small paragraph about how stressed he is with this schedule and i basically am either going to have to ride this out till July or not. I told him of course I’m in this and I am doing what I can to make it work. Typical routine I pick him up and I dropped him off at his house. The next day he complements me once and then drops off coffee at my work. That night I’m excited to see him and I come into his house and I go to give him a hug and kiss and he walks up to me to give me a high five. I go into give him a kiss and he pulls away and was like give me a high five. I told him I want a hug and a kiss since I haven’t been able to get that since he got back (kissed him when I picked him up but it was a peck). He then got pissed and was like why do you do this. He stated It’s not always about what i want (side note he never treats me with a high five). He then says you should just go home. I thought about it because here I was with my overnight bag to stay at his house. I Decided to stay because I was excited to give him presents I got him. I gave him the presents and he said nothing. He then states that he did everything I wanted from him today (the coffee and compliment) and I treat him that way. Mind you I was very thankful and had just given him the gifts I knew he would love or needed. So we sat in silence on the couch. He was giving me the silent treatment. In that moment I had so much anxiety in my chest that I told him I was going to go home because I didn’t want to feel anxious about our interaction. I didn’t feel me wanting a hug and kiss was a bad thing. He then said you do you. In that moment i decided I don’t want to live like that. I told him that I don’t want to feel the way I do like I’m the bad guy or everything I do is wrong. I want a safe space to express my feelings. And I deserve to be treated with  respect. 

Question: Am I asking for too much from him? Or did I make the right decision to remove myself. Any advice is appreciated 

A caveat: during the weeks when he’s gone we do talk on the phone but it’s very much like “how’s your day “ or we’d talk about work. I always say I love you and miss you. He typically doesn’t say he misses me. He normally says “aww good for you” as a joke. ",0,1763216851.0,relationship_advice,13,0.5,False

So Cyberhub decided to give me a Bollywood side quest today.

I was near the fountain minding my own business and fighting Gurgaon’s winter like it personally wronged me. That’s when I saw her. She walked in looking like the girl every coffee shop playlist is secretly written about. Hair flying, tote bag slipping, expression screaming “I am not even trying to pull this off.”

Her tote bag fell again and before my brain could stop my mouth, I said, “At this point your bag is trying to escape the relationship.” She stared at me for a full second, and then laughed. Not a normal laugh. A literal background music laugh. My confidence instantly went from 3 percent to 78.

We talked a bit. She told me she had an interview. I told her Cyberhub interviews are scary because even the security guards look more corporate than me. She snorted. I’m convinced this was the closest I’ll ever get to romance in real life.

Then the twist hit.

A random kid lost his balloon. The balloon floated up. The kid screamed like he just lost his family inheritance. And she? This girl literally ran after the balloon. Full slow-mo. Full drama. Full “Nike, please sponsor me.”

She caught it, returned it, and came back all out of breath, hair messy, laughing. I told her she’s basically a superhero now. She said, “Yeah but a tired one.”

Before I could ask anything useful, like her name for starters, her cab arrived. She waved, smiled, and left.

No name.
No number.
No Instagram.
Not even time for a “Hey, are you real?”

Just a cute, filmy, blink-and-you-miss-it moment at Cyberhub.

""Sweetheart, have you thought about what we talked about last time? Your grandfather's health is getting worse. You're our only daughter. Don't you want to come home and take over the company?""

In the quiet room, Demi Snow held a paintbrush while listening to her mother's worn voice on the phone.

The dim light cast a soft glow over her canvas as she drew the final stroke of a family of three.

Carol Snow thought this was another failed attempt. But unexpectedly, Demi spoke softly, ""Okay.""

Carol froze for a moment, surprised. ""Y-you agreed?""

""Yes,"" Demi said calmly. ""I'll come home. I just need some time to finish things here. I'll be home within two weeks.""

After exchanging a few more words, Demi ended the call.

She walked out of her studio and looked down from the staircase into the living room. Three people sat there.

Her gaze lingered on the man sitting on the couch.

He had sharp, handsome features—deep-set eyes, clean lines, and a quiet, serious aura. His shirt was buttoned all the way up, his dress pants crisp and perfect. Everything about him screamed control and elegance.

That was her husband, Nevin Blackwell, the man she had chosen against her family's wishes. She once believed Nevin was worth giving up everything for.

Nevin was known for his cold, distant manner. People in his circle called him the Ice Prince. But right now, he was smiling softly at another woman.

Nearby, a six-year-old boy with bright eyes ran into the woman's arms. ""Rhea, can you make me some orange-glazed fish? Please?""

Rhea Dunn touched his nose affectionately and smiled. ""Of course, cupcake.""

Orion Blackwell's eyes lit up with joy. ""You're the best! You're different than my mom; she never lets me eat what I want.""

He pouted after saying that.

Rhea smiled and said gently, ""Then you should eat a little more today.""

Orion nodded, his face bright with a sweet grin. ""Rhea, you're so nice. I wish you were my real mom.""

Rhea's smile deepened.

Upstairs, Demi's heart ached painfully.

She knew Orion could get greedy with food. Demi limited his portions because she didn't want his stomach to hurt later.

But watching them now—her husband, her son, and that woman—they looked like a real family. She was the one left out.

Demi went back to her room.

A few minutes later, footsteps sounded outside.

The door opened. Rhea walked in, her makeup flawless, her expression soft and gentle. ""Demi,"" she said sweetly, ""let's go downstairs and celebrate Orion's birthday together.""

Rhea used to be her intern. She'd come from a poor family and had just enough skill to get by. Demi still remembered the day Rhea broke down in her office, crying that if she couldn't find a job soon, she'd have to marry some guy back home.

Demi had taken pity on her and brought her into the company.

Who could've guessed she'd end up inviting a snake into her home?

Rhea copied everything Demi did—her style, her voice, and even how she spoke to Nevin. By the time Demi realized it, Rhea was already part of their home, close to both her husband and her son.

Demi had long seen through her act. She hated herself for letting a snake into the house.

""I'm not feeling well,"" she said coldly. ""I'll pass.""

Rhea put on her best innocent act. ""Demi, you're his mom. Orion needs your blessing today.""

Demi frowned, ready to refuse again, but then stopped. She sighed.

This is between me and Rhea. Orion shouldn't suffer because of it.

As his mother, I owe him my presence on his birthday.

Demi put down her paintbrush, brushed past Rhea, and headed downstairs.

For a second, Rhea's smile stiffened. A flash of malice crossed her eyes before she followed.

When Demi saw Nevin and Orion together, she froze.

Ten years ago, she joined Blackwell Group to gain experience and met Nevin there. They fought, laughed, and somehow fell in love. Against her family's wishes, she married him. Demi even cut ties with them because of it.

For the past decade, Demi never once regretted her choice. She had a rich, handsome husband who treated her well and a smart, adorable child.

She thought her life was perfect until Rhea showed up.

Demi watched as Rhea smiled sweetly, serving food for Nevin and Orion.

Rhea's arrival had shattered everything that once felt beautiful.

Demi picked up her fork, ready to eat, but suddenly felt a wave of nausea.

She set it down quickly and ran to the restroom, retching over the sink.

Nevin looked worried and started to follow her, but Rhea stopped him. Her eyes filled with concern.

""Mr. Blackwell, what's wrong with Demi?"" she asked anxiously.

Nevin comforted gently. ""She's been doing this lately. It's nothing; don't worry.""

Then he turned toward the restroom and mocked coldly, ""What's your excuse this time? Did you catch a cold? Or is the food not good enough again?""

Demi said nothing. She wiped the corner of her mouth with a tissue.

If she told them she was pregnant, would anyone believe her?

Forget it. She was already planning to leave. Why should she tell them?

There's no point in ruining the sweet moment between her husband and that homewrecker.

Rhea was a secretary, but she had the nerve to scold her boss. ""Mr. Blackwell, don't talk like that. Maybe she really doesn't feel well. She's lost so much weight lately.""

She stood up, poured a cup of hot tea, and handed it to Demi.

""Are you okay? Here, drink some tea.""

The sight of her disgusting face made Demi feel even sicker. Irritated, she pushed her hand away.

She hadn't used much force, but Rhea stumbled slightly. Somehow, the water spilled on Rhea's hand.

""Ouch!"" Rhea cried out in pain.

""Rhea!""

""Rhea!""

Nevin and Orion rushed over at the same time. The father and son stared at Rhea's red, scalded hand with panic and concern.

Her fair skin had turned bright red from the burn.

Tears filled Orion's eyes as he looked at Rhea. ""Does it hurt a lot?"" The boy asked softly, his voice trembling with worry.

Rhea forced a smile, pretending to be strong. ""It's okay, Orion. I wasn't careful. It doesn't hurt.""

Nevin turned toward Demi, his eyes burning with anger.

His voice was cold as ice. ""What trouble are you trying to cause this time?""

Demi's heart twisted in pain. She caught Rhea's smug look, then saw her son standing protectively in front of her. Hopelessness washed over her, and she closed her eyes.

""I didn't do anything,"" she said quietly.

But of course, Nevin didn't believe her.

When the family doctor arrived, Nevin helped Rhea sit up, letting her lean against his chest. His dark eyes were filled with disappointment.

""Demi, you've changed. The woman I knew would never do something like this out of jealousy.""

Changed?

Yes. She had changed.

Ten years ago, she wouldn't have had a stomach full of stretch marks from giving birth. She wouldn't have dull skin from sleepless nights.

And she wouldn't have given up her career to cook and clean for a man, only to be replaced by someone new.

Demi suddenly felt exhausted. She swallowed her explanation and went upstairs.

Before entering her room, she looked back one last time. The living room was chaos, but in the middle of it stood her husband and son, both surrounding Rhea with concern, like a perfect little family.

Demi smiled bitterly and shook her head. Gently, she placed a hand on her stomach and set a countdown to her departure on her phone.

Then she walked into her room without hesitation.

From that moment on, she promised herself she would never disturb them again.            


Chapter 2 I'm Done Playing This Ridiculous Game


The noise outside slowly faded away. Demi didn't care what was going on. She just put on her earplugs and eye mask and slept until morning.

She'd decided to go home and took over the family business. That meant she had to quit her job here.

Since giving birth to Orion, she had rarely appeared at the company. But back when Nevin took over the Blackwell Group, she was right there beside him, helping build everything step by step.

Blackwell Group wouldn't have become the country's top firm without her.

So even though she hadn't worked in the office for years, she still received a large annual bonus and dividends.

Early that morning, Demi stared at her reflection in the mirror. Her long wavy brown hair framed a delicate face, but her pretty charming eyes carried no trace of a smile.

She was beautiful. No one could deny that. Even after years as a stay-at-home wife, all the exhaustion and stress hadn't taken away her charm.

But the emotional abuse at home and the stress of pregnancy had drained the light from her eyes, making them look lifeless and dull now.

At the top floor of Blackwell Group, Demi was waiting for her resignation papers to be printed.

Behind her, she overheard a few employees chatting.

""Did you see Rhea's Instagram?""

""Not yet. What did she post this time?""

""Plenty. Looks like she was celebrating someone's birthday. You've got to see it.""

They laughed, but when they looked up and saw Demi standing there, their smiles froze.

""Uh—M-Ms. Snow?""

""Ms. Snow, you're back at the office?""

Demi gave them a polite nod. They quickly murmured a goodbye and rushed off.

As they disappeared down the hall, she could still hear them whispering.

""Ugh, what bad luck. Why's Demi here?""

""She's already married Mr. Blackwell. Why show off in front of us?""

""Please, I bet she and Mr. Blackwell aren't doing great. Wouldn't be surprised if they're getting divorced.""

Demi wasn't bothered with this. She was used to this kind of talk. Her coworkers had never liked her much.

If it hadn't been for all the office bullying she faced early on and Nevin stepping in to help, she probably would've never fallen for him.

Bored from waiting, she unlocked her phone and opened Instagram.

The first thing she saw was Rhea's new post. A collage of nine pictures.

The first one was from Orion's birthday party last night, lavishly decorated with balloons and a huge three-layer cake right in the center.

But what caught Demi's eye was a hospital photo. Three hands of different sizes stacked together. It looked warm and cozy.

A trip to the hospital again? Just for a burn?

Demi let out a dry laugh and scrolled through the comments. They were all full of envy and well wishes.

[Wow! A birthday party for the little one? So sweet!]

[Another lovey-dovey post! Who's your mystery man, girl? Show us already]

[Doesn't matter what happens—as long as the family's together, that's happiness.]

The comments went on and on.

She knew exactly what Rhea was doing. Rhea was trying to get under her skin, trying to make her lose control, run to Nevin, and demand answers.

Once upon a time, that would've worked. She couldn't stand seeing that fake sweetness or how her husband and son would rather be with a woman who copied her every move.

But now? She was leaving soon. None of it mattered anymore.

Demi let out a faint smile and tapped the little red heart beneath the post.

A moment later, with her resignation letter in hand, Demi went straight to the CEO's office and handed it to Nevin's personal assistant.

The people in the secretary department were whispering behind her back, mocking her for showing off at the office as if she owned the place. But the moment they saw the resignation letter, the room went silent. Then someone gasped.

""""What—wait, am I seeing this right?!""

""Ms. Snow is resigning?!""

The assistant froze, panic flashing across her face. ""Mr. Blackwell is in an important meeting. Maybe we should wait until he's done—""

""Don't bother,"" Demi said with a calm smile. ""I'm just the chief of secretary in name only, remember? You have the authority to process it. No need to trouble him.""

People around whispered in low voices. ""Could the rumors be true? Did Demi and Mr. Blackwell break up? Is Ms. Dunn turning out to be a homewrecker?""

""Why did you assume it's Ms. Dunn? Isn't she married?""

""You're clueless. Did you see that hand on Instagram? That Rolex costs a fortune. No one in all of Yraka could afford it except Mr. Blackwell.""

""Exactly. Didn't you notice that Ms. Dunn took over all Ms. Snow's work after she went on maternity leave?""

""And now that she's quitting, maybe it's because she's stepping aside for good!""

Demi could hear every word of it. They'd always loved gossiping. In the past, she would've been crushed, hiding under the covers and crying into her pillow.

But now? She suddenly realized none of it mattered anymore.

She smiled at everyone as if she hadn't heard a thing, bowed politely, and said, ""Thank you all for your hard work over the past ten years. I hope Blackwell Group continues to grow and thrive.""

The office fell silent. No one knew what to say. Demi walked back to her desk and began packing up her things.

After ten years, her workspace was filled to the brim. Ten years' worth of memories were stacked neatly in front of her—books she bought when she first joined, binders filled with notes, and her old planner from when she became Nevin's secretary.

Flipping it open, she saw her handwriting still crisp and clear.

""1. He drinks a cup of hand-ground coffee every morning.""

""2. He hates people being late.""

""3. He can't stand women who wear perfume.""

Page after page was filled with small details about him—his habits, his preferences, and his temper. Every line represented her dedication.

Only God knew what Demi had gone through to be a good secretary. People always thought being a secretary was easy, that it just meant being pretty and pleasing a man with their body. They had no idea how wrong they were.

Nevin was the only one who'd ever seen the truth. He'd seen her stay late night after night, reading contracts until her eyes hurt, building presentations from scratch, and researching every single competitor the company ever had. She could list every company's data and performance by heart.

It was because of her relentless effort that the untouchable Ice Prince of the Blackwell family finally stepped down from his pedestal and became the man everyone admired today.

Demi once believed Nevin understood her better than anyone else in the world. She thought their bond went deeper than love, that they shared the same dream, the same fight. She was wrong.

Ten years of devotion, ten years of struggle and love—all of it had turned into nothing but ashes.

Demi quietly focused on cleaning up her desk when the meeting ended. Rhea was the first to step out.

She looked quite cheerful at first, but the moment she saw Demi, her smile froze.

What is she doing here?

Did Demi see the post on Instagram? Is she here to confront me?

Rhea grew excited just thinking about it. She couldn't sit still as she went back to her desk, waiting nervously for the storm to hit.

She lowered her head, eyes red, looking like she'd just been terribly wronged.

Nevin was the last to leave the conference room. As he passed the secretary department, he noticed Demi sitting there.

Her desk was the closest to his office—a symbol of trust and affection back in the days when they were still in love.

But now, just the sight of her made him irritated.

What made it worse was how cheerful she looked. Demi was flipping through a book with a small smile on her face.

Across from her, Rhea sat miserably, dabbing her tears with a tissue.

Nevin frowned.

He tapped the edge of Demi's desk and said coldly, ""Come in.""

Demi looked up, her expression composed. ""Okay,"" she replied simply.

The moment she stepped into his office, his voice turned icy.

""The company doesn't need you here anymore. Unless there's something important, don't show up in the office again.""            


Chapter 3 I Quit, Mr. Blackwell


Demi froze. No matter how many times Nevin had disappointed her, his cold voice still pierced her heart like a needle.

Her smile faded. ""Alright,"" she said quietly, eyes downcast.

Nevin had expected Demi to fight back, maybe even yell. But her calm obedience caught him off guard. For the first time, he really looked at her.

Rhea was right. Demi had lost a lot of weight lately.

Maybe her nausea last night wasn't a jealous act after all.

Nevin pressed his lips together, his tone softening a little. ""Ms. Dunn is doing great at her job. Your only duty now is to take care of Orion.""

Then his voice turned sharp again. ""I've told you many times—there's nothing going on between me and her. Demi, stop being dramatic. Don't make me regret choosing you as my wife.""

Regret?

She smiled bitterly. If anyone regretted it, it was her. She had given up her family business and traded it for this hollow title as his wife.

Demi came from a prestigious family. Wouldn't it be better to go back and live as the beloved heiress of the Snow Group, adored and protected by everyone?

Closing her eyes, Demi pulled out an envelope and handed it to him. Her tone was polite but distant. ""Mr. Blackwell, please approve my resignation. Starting tomorrow, I'll officially leave the company.""

She turned to leave, but just as she reached the door, Nevin grabbed her arm.

""Demi?""

His voice carried surprise, as if he hadn't processed what just happened.

Nevin glanced down at the resignation letter in his hand, her signature printed clearly in black ink. His face darkened, anger flickering in his eyes.

""You're doing this out of spite?"" he demanded.

""I thought you came here to make peace, but you're just making it worse?""

Demi kept her gaze low, her long lashes trembling slightly.

""No, Mr. Blackwell,"" she said calmly. ""You said the company doesn't need me. Turns out, I feel the same way.""

""Ten years have passed. This company isn't what it used to be,"" Demi said calmly. ""Since everyone seems to adore Ms. Dunn, there's no point in me sitting around collecting a paycheck. I'd rather step down and make room for her.""

Nevin let out a cold laugh. His eyes were sharp as blades, cutting straight through her words.

""Don't use these ten years to guilt-trip me. I know how much you've done for this company. You were a good employee once. But Demi, ever since you gave birth, you haven't been involved in business at all. I've been patient with you.""

He leaned closer, his tone low and dismissive. ""As long as you take care of our child, you'll always be the lady of the household. That's all I've ever asked, but you couldn't even manage that.""

Nevin's voice grew harsher. ""And now you want to step down gracefully? You just want to throw Rhea into the spotlight and make her take the blame. Demi, I know you too well. You're full of scheme, but I'm warning you don't be so vicious.""

He paused, his voice dripping with sarcasm. ""Have you even apologized to Rhea for the incident happened last night?""

Apologize?

To the homewrecker destroyed my family?

Shouldn't Rhea be the one who owed me a thank you?

Demi suddenly laughed, the sound soft but cutting. She tilted her head, looking at him with calm curiosity. ""You're right. I'm vicious. But tell me, Mr. Blackwell, have you ever thought about giving up the appearance?""

By giving up meant divorce.

They'd fought about it many times over the years. Every argument ended the same way—no resolution, just silence.

Nevin would never agree. Even if he cheated, Demi was still his wife.

That was the kind of man Nevin was—controlling, arrogant, and born to dominate.

At first, Demi didn't really want to leave. She just wanted him to look at her again, to remember she was there.

But now, she was tired.

A clean break, each walked their own ways.

Each of them had a child. That didn't sound so bad anymore.

Nevin's expression darkened like a storm. He grabbed her arm so hard it hurt, his grip full of rage.

""This is your last chance, Demi. If you keep failing, I'll have to find Orion a new mother.""

He didn't stop there. ""Do you know how many times Orion's told me he's miserable with you? No fun. No freedom. Nothing.""

His voice turned to ice. ""Why do you fail at everything—as a wife and as a mother?""

Failure.

Demi closed her eyes and let out a long, shaky breath.

So that's how it was.

All those nights she stayed up waiting for him, making him warm lemon tea after his drinking session was a failure.

The times she hand-washed his couture suits and got frostbite in the dead of winter—failure.

Even teaching their son advanced math to meet the high standards of being a heir of the Blackwells—still a failure.

There was no place left for her in this house.

""I'm sorry, Mr. Blackwell,"" she said quietly.

Her tone was calm, sincere.

A loser should know when to take her final bow.

Her other hand slipped into her pocket. She opened her phone and tapped the screen.

A countdown started—another 14 days to go.

When it hit zero, she would be gone. Completely. No more arguments, no more tears, no more bothering Nevin with her existence.

Her calmness caught him off guard.

Nevin wanted to say something—anything—but Demi didn't give him the chance.

She walked away resolutely. Nevin reached out to stop her, but his hand closed on nothing but air.

A sharp pain clenched his chest as he watched her go, a strange panic building inside him.

Nevin frowned, watching Demi walk away. It felt like something important, something he couldn't name was slipping further and further from him.

Once she stepped outside, Demi pulled out her phone and made a call to her best friend, Phoebe Lennon.

They used to be best friends, but they hadn't spoken in seven years.

Phoebe was a fashion designer who practically lived on airplanes, traveling across the country to tailor clothes for models.

Some were male, some female. Well, things sometimes happened between adults who worked that closely.

To put it simply, Phoebe changed boyfriends as easily as changing outfits. Nevin couldn't stand that about her. After Demi gave birth to Orion, he told her to stay away from Phoebe, worried she'd be a bad influence and corrupted their son.

And Demi listened. She actually listened. For six whole years, she cut off her oldest friend, just because her husband said so.

It had been a long time since Phoebe last heard from Demi. The moment she picked up, her voice was sharp with anger. ""So you finally remembered me! I thought you'd completely lost your mind over that man. What happened? Regret finally hit you?""

Demi couldn't help but laugh through her tears.

Nevin's insults hadn't made her cry. Rhea's tricks hadn't made her cry. Even watching her son calling another woman mother hadn't broken her.

But hearing Phoebe's voice did. For the first time, she cried from regret.

""Yes,"" she admitted. ""I regret it. Phoebe, Is it too late to come back to you now?""

Hearing Demi's sincere voice, there was a long pause on the other end. When Phoebe finally spoke again, her voice was trembling with tears too.

""It's never too late. You finally came to your senses. You idiot, do you know how hard it's been running the studio without you all these years?""

Her tone turned fierce again, full of emotion. ""The entire art world's been waiting for you! Demi, being a corporate secretary is a waste of your gift. You were born to hold a brush—you're the greatest painter of our time, the last jewel of the Impressionists. I've been waiting for you.""

""I'm sorry, Phoebe. I'm so sorry.""

Standing on the busy street, Demi crouched down and sobbed.

She should've never forgotten who she was. She used to be so proud.

Born gifted, brilliant, and proud—Nevin never even knew that Demi had studied fine arts overseas.

Her graduation piece had been selected for the Janbus International Art Exhibition, shocking the art world.

After that, her paintings sold for seven-figure prices at auction.

And yet, she'd walked away from all of it. For the sake of living experience, she had taken a regular office job, learned administration, finance, and management and still excelled.

After ten long years away from her canvas, she decided she was done hiding. She was going home—to art, to herself.             


Chapter 4 I'm Done with This Ungrateful Brat


After setting a date with Phoebe to hand over the studio, Demi went home.

She gave herself two weeks. Ten years was such a long time. There were too many loose ends to tie up before she could walk away for good.

The biggest issue at hand was the household itself.

The huge 5,000-square-foot villa didn't have a single helper because Nevin complained they were noisy.

So, Demi handled every bit of cleaning herself.

If she was going to leave, she wanted to do it gracefully—like a professional, like the perfect secretary she'd always been. That was her pride as the heiress of the Snows.

Rhea, of course, wasn't the type to do chores. Demi decided to find a good maid for her husband and son.

All day, she interviewed candidates. She asked them to cook soups the way Nevin liked them. That night, while Demi was having dinner, a panicked shout came from the door.

""Bill! Call the family doctor—now!""

It was Nevin's voice.

Demi froze. Being pregnant, the faint smell of blood made her sick.

Her heart twisted with worry.

What happened? Is he hurt?

She hurried toward the entrance—only to see Nevin rushing in, carrying a woman in his arms. Snow was falling outside, clinging to his hair and coat, but he didn't seem to notice.

Nevin laid the woman on the couch, voice tight with anger. ""Where is the doctor? Get the doctor here, now!""

Demi didn't even have to look at the woman's face to know who she was.

Rhea.

Wrapped in a thick bedrobe, Demi stood aside and asked calmly, ""What happened to her?""

The two had argued that morning, and Nevin barely spared her a glance now. His voice was sharp and cold; he wasn't in the mood to talk.

""She ran into a debt collector. Got stabbed in the shoulder.""

""Debt collector?"" Demi frowned. ""Whose debt?""

She couldn't help but wonder—was the mighty CEO of Blackwell Group in financial trouble now?

Before Nevin could respond, Rhea—her face pale—spoke up weakly. ""I'm sorry, Demi. This is all my fault.""

""My dad owes money from gambling. Somehow those people found out I'm Mr. Blackwell's secretary. They tried to grab me on my way home. I fought back and got hurt. Luckily, Mr. Blackwell was working late and happened to be there. Otherwise, I might've been killed.""

""Cut the crap!"" Nevin interrupted sharply. ""Don't say that. As long as I'm here, no one will hurt you. But your apartment isn't safe anymore. I've called the police. Until they catch the men, you'll stay at my house.""

""No, she can't live here,"" Demi said firmly, without hesitation.

Nevin glanced up at her.

Her face was pale too, but hers was a healthy tone. Maybe because she'd finally quit her job and cleared things up with her friend, she actually looked lighter today.

Demi's cheeks held a soft flush. Her silk robe hung loosely over her frame, soft and elegant, like a lazy Persian cat basking in comfort.

The anger that had been simmering in Nevin all morning suddenly faded when he heard her refusal.

He turned his head slightly, a hint of mockery in his tone.

Of course. Another one of her little games—pretending to be calm while hiding her jealousy of Rhea.

His voice turned cold, and he warned, ""Demi, this is my house.""

He was the man of the house.

Whoever he wanted to keep—stayed.

""Still no,"" Demi replied, her voice sharp and steady.

""There aren't enough rooms. She has nowhere to sleep.""

The villa was huge, three stories tall, but there were only three bedrooms suitable for sleeping.

One for Orion, one for Demi, and one for Nevin. That was it.

When they first married, there had been plenty of guest rooms, but Nevin—full of affection back then—had remodeled them all.

Now the villa had a luxury nursery, a walk-in closet, rooms for her art and yoga, and even a green room.

But no extra bedrooms.

All three bedrooms had once been planned by Nevin—for the son and daughter they hoped to have someday.

Back then, neither of them could've imagined that one day, their marriage would grow so cold that they'd sleep in separate rooms.

He hadn't expected Demi to use that as her reason for refusing Rhea to stay. Nevin's face darkened instantly.

His voice tightened with barely restrained anger. ""Demi, you're sleeping in the master bedroom.""

The meaning was clear. Nevin expected them to share a bed again.

After all, no matter how strained things had become, just three months ago they'd still shared that bed.

How else would the child in her stomach have come to be?

Demi no longer cared about this. That night three months ago had only happened because he was drunk.

There was no love, not even hate, just emptiness.

She stood her ground, refusing to budge. Her silence and defiance made Nevin's anger boil over.

Just then, a small voice broke through the tension. ""Dad? Mom? What's going on?"" Orion came down the stairs, rubbing his sleepy eyes. ""I heard you two fighting again.""

His words trailed off when he saw Rhea on the couch, her arm bandaged and a trace of blood still visible. His drowsiness vanished.

""Rhea!""

He ran to her side immediately. ""What happened? Are you hurt? Does it hurt? Are you okay?""

Rhea smiled softly and patted his head. ""I'm fine, cupcake. Go back to bed.""

""No! You're hurt! I'm not sleeping until you feel better!""

The boy insisted, clinging tightly to Rhea's arm and refusing to let go.

Watching him clutch Rhea so affectionately, Demi let out a smile. ""Don't worry, Orion,"" she said lightly. ""Rhea will be staying with us for a few days. But since we're out of bedrooms, she'll have to share a room with you. Is that okay?""

""Really?!"" Orion's eyes went wide with excitement.

""That's awesome—""

He suddenly covered his mouth mid-sentence.

""Wait—no, Mom! That's not what I meant.""

He'd completely forgotten—Demi hated it when he got too close to Rhea. Once, he'd spent too long playing with Rhea and lost track of time. When he finally came home, Mom was furious.

From that day on, Dad taught him something. Never let your mom know how much you like Rhea or how kind she really is.

""It's fine. You can mean that,"" Demi said darkly.

Her cold hands slipped under her nightgown and rested on her stomach.

Now she finally understood what it meant to give birth to an ingrate.

She still remembered the day Orion was born. Demi had been in labor for two days. The doctors told Nevin they could only save one—her or the baby.

Nevin's eyes had turned red as he shouted outside the operating room, ""Save Demi! Just save her!""

But she refused. Crying and begging through the pain, she asked the doctors to save the baby. She would give up everything but not the child she shared with Nevin.

In the end, she pushed through the pain. Demi gave birth to Orion naturally, without a dose of anesthesia.

She gave up her career and devoted herself completely to raising him.

And what did she get in return? A son who adored another woman and wished he could trade his mother for her.

Demi was exhausted.

Truth was, she hadn't even wanted this new baby. When the test came back positive last week, her first thought was to end it.

Life had already drained every bit of hope from her. She didn't want to give Nevin another child.

But now that she was leaving, a sliver of hope flickered inside of her again.

Without the weight of this family holding her back, maybe she and the baby could start fresh—live free, live better.

Realizing this, Demi decided to stop wasting her time and walked away.

Orion didn't understand why his mom was acting that way. He just stood there, staring blankly as she walked away. For a long time, he didn't move or make a sound. Then, the boy suddenly broke down crying.

Kids were sensitive, even when they didn't understand much.

But somewhere deep inside, through that invisible bond of blood, he felt it. His mother was leaving him for real.

""Waaah—!""

Rhea jumped at the sound, rushing over to comfort him. ""Don't cry, Orion. I'm with you. Don't be scared, okay? I got you.""

She looked up at Nevin, her big tearful eyes full of quiet accusation.

See? Demi made him cry again.

Nevin's face darkened. He glanced up toward the second floor, his gaze cold and heavy. Eventually, he said nothing.    


Chapter 5 I'm Done with This Family


Demi slept soundly through the night. The next morning, she came downstairs, planning to make herself breakfast.

But before she even reached the kitchen, the smell of food filled the air.

It was Rhea. She had already made breakfast for everyone and was now grinding coffee for Nevin by hand.

When Rhea saw Demi, she smiled politely. ""Good morning, Demi. You're up! Come, I made sandwiches. I hope you'll like them.""

""Rhea's cooking is wonderful. Who wouldn't like them?"" Orion chimed in brightly.

Then he sneaked a glance at his mother, his face showing a mix of fear and guilt.

He was scared of his mom, and he hated her a little, too.

Mom seemed so strange lately. Why did she always look at me coldly?

Every time he praised Rhea, Demi used to get upset but would still try harder to please him. That way, he could use her guilt to skip tutoring and have more time to play.

Demi could almost guess what her son was thinking. She gave a small, ironic smile.

Did Orion really think I couldn't see through his little tricks?

Once upon a time, she had hated Rhea because she couldn't accept her husband had a lover.

When it came to Rhea caring for Orion, Demi had always turned a blind eye.

After all, Orion was the eldest grandson. When she gave birth, Erin Blackwell, her mother-in-law, had reminded her countless times never to relax with the boy's education.

Demi had always wanted him to grow up happy. She knew her son was lively and sweet.

He loved comic books, video games, and the outdoors. But as Nevin's wife and the well-known Mrs. Blackwell in high society, she had to appear strict and proper.

Because of this, Orion would often run to his father and complain she was too harsh.

What he didn't know was that Demi had studied every major education system from around the world. She tried her best to balance discipline with play.

On the outside, she looked serious and unkind. But back when Rhea was her intern, Demi had personally drawn a set of storybook manuals and asked her to use them to help Orion learn through play.

Orion's favorite dish—orange-glazed fish—was one Rhea had learned directly from Demi.

Demi never imagined that what she once taught with care would someday cut her like a knife. Her face turned cold, a trace of disbelief and quiet despair in her eyes.

""What are you wearing?"" She asked flatly.

She didn't expect Demi's first words to be that. Rhea hesitated, her voice small and timid.

""I-it's a dress. I didn't have any clean clothes last night, so I just grabbed one from the closet. Demi, what's wrong?""

What's wrong?

A stranger was standing there in her clothes, making coffee for her husband and breakfast for her son. And Rhea had the nerve to ask what was wrong?

Nevin sensed Demi was about to make a scene. He frowned and cut in, ""Demi, it's just a dress. Don't overreact.""

He added, almost impatiently, ""You still have the card I gave you. You can buy a hundred new ones.""

Demi let out a short, bitter laugh.

Her stomach twisted. She wasn't sure if it was from morning sickness or disgust.

""Nevin,"" she said quietly, ""did you forget what that dress was?""

It was the dress she'd worn for their first night together.

Back then, Demi had just graduated—young, curious, and full of dreams.

At a business party, she thought she could help her company land a million-dollar deal. She drank too much trying to impress the clients, only to realize too late that someone had spiked her drink. That night, by accident and fate, she ended up in bed with Nevin.

The next morning, she woke up to find her clothes torn beyond repair. She sat on the edge of the bed, face burning red with embarrassment.

Nevin had found her shy reaction adorable. He sent his assistant to buy her that couture dress and later transferred her to be his personal secretary.

Demi remembered every detail. That dress marked the beginning of everything between them.

Nevin had forgotten all of it. He even let Rhea wear the same thing she once had. It was revolting.

Nevin stared at Demi, trying to read her face. A mocking smile tugged at his lips, and a strange glint flickered in his dark eyes.

""What is it?"" he asked coldly. ""Say it.

""Demi, are you seriously this sentimental over a dress?""

Sensing the tension rising in the room, Rhea hurried forward, grabbing Demi's hand as if frightened.

""Demi, please don't blame Mr. Blackwell,"" Rhea said softly, her voice trembling. ""He didn't know anything. I put it on without asking.

""Mr. Blackwell felt sorry for me that he didn't make me take it off. I didn't realize it bothered you so much.

""I'm so sorry, Demi. I'll change it out now. Please don't be upset!""

Rhea pleaded softly, eyes brimming with tears that threatened to fall at any second.

Demi felt sick. She yanked her hand away. ""It's fine. That dress looks great on you. It's yours now.""

She gave a faint, bitter smile. ""In fact, take whatever you like from my closet. Clothes, shoes—whatever catches your eye, including ... ""

Her gaze lifted to Nevin. She let out a mocking smile.

""Everything I have in this house is yours.""

""Demi!""

Nevin finally lost control at the declaration. He slammed his hand on the table, his voice bursting with anger.

""Do you have to push her into corner?""

Demi laughed faintly, her tone icy. ""I'm not the one doing the pushing here, Nevin. You two are.""

Ring! Ring!

A notification tone cut through the tension. Demi glanced at her phone.

Countdown: 13 days left.

At this rate, she thought, she might not even last until then.

Every day, Nevin managed to push her a little further, testing just how much of her pride she had left.

Today it was a dress. What would it be tomorrow?

Her thoughts froze when she caught a faint scent from Rhea's body—perfume.

Perfume?

The scent was faint at first, almost like natural body fragrance. From a distance, Demi hadn't noticed it, but up close, it was strong and unmistakable.

Her face went pale. Demi had always been sensitive to smells. Her mind flashed to the rule she'd once written in her notebook.

3. He can't stand women who wear perfume.

A bitter laugh rose in her chest. So that's how it is, Nevin.

All your rules disappear the moment she's around?

Demi suddenly laughed, but tears slipped down her cheeks without warning. In that instant, she realized she couldn't wait for the countdown anymore.

She just wanted to leave now.

Her parents were waiting. Her grandfather was waiting. Even her childhood friends were waiting.

So why was she still here? Why was Nevin still standing there, letting another woman humiliate her, letting Rhea trample over the ten best years of her life?

""If you think I'm pushing you,"" Nevin said coldly, ""then get out of my house.""

His eyes were sharp, his voice cutting. Nevin finally exploded.

""All you ever do is sulk around the house like the world owes you something. Demi, didn't you say you wanted a divorce? Fine. Let's do it.""

Demi's chest rose and fell, her voice shaking with emotion. ""Fine! Then let's—""

She didn't finish. Her breath caught as she clutched her chest, face turning red, gasping for air.

Her wide eyes darted toward Rhea in disbelief.

That perfume.

It's a floral scent!

Demi's lips twisted into a faint, broken smile. ""Nevin, if you wanted me dead,"" she spoke hoarsely, ""you could've just said so.""

I was near the fountain minding my own business and fighting Gurgaon’s winter like it personally wronged me. That’s when I saw her. She walked in looking like the girl every coffee shop playlist is secretly written about. Hair flying, tote bag slipping, expression screaming “I am not even trying to pull this off.”

Her tote bag fell again and before my brain could stop my mouth, I said, “At this point your bag is trying to escape the relationship.” She stared at me for a full second, and then laughed. Not a normal laugh. A literal background music laugh. My confidence instantly went from 3 percent to 78.

We talked a bit. She told me she had an interview. I told her Cyberhub interviews are scary because even the security guards look more corporate than me. She snorted. I’m convinced this was the closest I’ll ever get to romance in real life.

Then the twist hit.

A random kid lost his balloon. The balloon floated up. The kid screamed like he just lost his family inheritance. And she? This girl literally ran after the balloon. Full slow-mo. Full drama. Full “Nike, please sponsor me.”

She caught it, returned it, and came back all out of breath, hair messy, laughing. I told her she’s basically a superhero now. She said, “Yeah but a tired one.”

Before I could ask anything useful, like her name for starters, her cab arrived. She waved, smiled, and left.

No name.
No number.
No Instagram.
Not even time for a “Hey, are you real?”

Just a cute, filmy, blink-and-you-miss-it moment at Cyberhub.

Last night was my first night. 

I tried my best to follow the advice I've read here... starting with wearing the mask for a few hours before sleep. Drs office set the pressure levels already and preset my heated hose to 80° and my humidity to 4.

In the first hour, my nose IMMEDIATELY clogged up, and I got very dizzy. I shaved my beard to make sure I had a good seal, and set my humidity to 7 (8 is max). Worked a bit better, but got rainout. Woke up a few times to use the bathroom and had a wet mask. I ended up setting the humidity back down to 5. Woke up to a dry mouth and empty water tank (this may be partially because of how many hours I used it in the evening before sleep). 

But worst of all, I woke up with a headache. Also, my Garmin watch tells me I had zero improvement with oxygen levels during the night. 

My titration study - which was a month and a half ago - I felt went pretty poorly. I remember struggling to breath all night, I remember being awake for most of the night, but my Garmin said I made it up to 100% O2 levels several times. 

My coffee table puts the machine at exactly my head height, and I've got a low loop. Can't put it lower without putting it on the floor. 

I don't know what I'm asking for. I see some folks who the mahine works for instanty, and others who struggle for months on end with next to nothing for FELT improvement, and I feel like I'm already doomed for the latter category. I have so little confidence that my levels were selected right during my titration study as I was constantly breathing against the machine. I breathe in ""manual mode"" all day long anyway. I'm 215 pounds and 5'7"" with decent muscle mass. Besides a bit of a gut, I'm not grossly overweight or anything. Never smoked (anything) or had alcohol in my entire life. And this morning I'm nursing a headache and trying to remember if my lips were numb last night or not.

1oxsybv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1oxsybv/crush_on_someone_i_work_with/,Crush on someone I work with,"Sorry for the wall, but I thought I would come to this subreddit for advice considering I've forgotten how dating and all of this stuff works. Also sorry if my post is all over the place. 

So... a lady and I started talking at work (we work at the same place but in different departments) back in April. Nothing crazy. She initiated the conversation due to my tattoos and that's how we ended up figuring out that we like the same music. Cool stuff. We work in different departments and would usually run into each other and just chat. I wasn't really actively pursuing anything at the time, but the more I saw and chatted with her the more I was realizing I was into her as more than a friend. 

Finally in September I invited her to a show and she gave me her number to send her the flyer. That was that. Then she started texting me with just small talk stuff (which I honestly wasn't expecting). You know, ""how was your weekend"" ""send me some bands"" kind of texts. When we do text, they're not small texts either. We tend to both go all out. 

She ended up not being able to go to the show but pitched the idea of us hanging out and grabbing coffee and food. We ended up doing that and just chatting. It was a good time. I didn't try and be even remotely flirty but she did drop a ""that's really cute"" to a few things I mentioned about myself. 

We made plans last week but they ended up getting canceled. Not a big deal. We made plans to reschedule. She did however call me and we ended up on the phone for over an hour just nonstop talking about music and other random things. 

I guess the biggest issue in my head is that I can't tell if she's even remotely interested in me as more than that. I know the obvious thing to do is let her know how I feel and it either works out or we keep it friendly and I get over it. 

She's also not a big texter from what I can tell. We'll have few days where we go back and fourth, but for the most part, it's her initiating a text, me getting back a little later, and not hearing back for 1-3 days. I'm patient though. She does her thing and I do mine. She randomly apologized for that when we talked on the phone and I was understanding. We're both working adults. Not everyone is on their phone all the time. Some people don't like to text.

She is also INCREDIBLY shy and introverted at work... AND she didn't use her phone at all when we hung out. So idk if that might play a roll in the whole texting thing. Apparently when we hung out in October, that was the first time she's actually done something with someone since moving out here in March. 

I'm just hoping I don't end up making things awkward. I haven't dated in nearly 5 years so I am absolutely bad at all of this. Also... she's the first woman in nearly 5 years who I have REALLY been interested in.

Anywho, thank you for letting me vent. We will see what happens. She's absolutely an amazing woman, and regardless of what happens, I feel very lucky to have been able to meet her and become friends. ",1,1763216597.0,Crushes,1,0.99,False

Sometimes I'll just be wide awake at 3am with weird amounts of energy. Usually I watch TV or scroll my phone. Last Tuesday I decided to reorganize my apartment instead.

I went HARD. I reorganized everything. Kitchen cabinets, bathroom drawers, closet, bookshelves, under my bed, my desk drawers, everything. I was in some kind of zone. I remember thinking I was being so logical and efficient.

I was not.

I can't find anything now. Nothing is where it should be. My pasta is in the bathroom cabinet. My tampons are in the kitchen next to the coffee mugs. I found my phone charger in the linen closet wrapped around a candle.

But it gets worse. I labeled things. I made labels with my label maker at 4am and stuck them on EVERYTHING. Except the labels make no fucking sense.

My sock drawer is labeled ""foot bags."" My spice rack says ""flavor dust."" The drawer where I keep batteries and random cords is labeled ""electric spaghetti.""

I've been looking for my good scissors for three days. I finally found them this morning in a box labeled ""danger hands"" in the back of my coat closet. With my eyebrow tweezers and a cheese grater.

My coworker asked to borrow a book yesterday and I told her I'd bring it. I KNOW I own this book. I've seen it. I have no idea where it is. I've checked the bookshelf (organized by color for some reason, not by author or title). Not there. I found it an hour ago in my kitchen junk drawer in a plastic bag labeled ""word rectangles.""

My boyfriend came over last night and asked where I keep the trash bags. I said under the sink like a normal person. They were not under the sink. We found them in my bedroom closet next to my winter boots in a bin labeled ""tube garbage holders.""

He asked what the hell happened and I had to explain that I reorganized everything while manic on insomnia and apparently I was in some kind of cryptic labeling mood.

The worst part is I REMEMBER doing this. I remember thinking ""yes, this makes perfect sense, future me will totally understand this system."" Future me does not understand this system. Future me is actively being gaslit by past me.

I've been late to work twice this week because I couldn't find my keys (they were in the freezer in a bag labeled ""cold metal friends"").

My apartment is extremely organized. Everything has a place and a label. I just have no idea what the organizational system IS or why anything is where it is.

TL;DR: Reorganized my entire apartment during an insomnia episode at 3am with a cryptic labeling system that made sense at the time. Now I can't find anything and ""electric spaghetti"" haunts me.",31,1763216418.0,tifu,15,0.81,False
