1jsss15,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1jsss15/no_coffee_and_chocolate_for_6_years_now/,No coffee and chocolate for 6 years now,"I was diagnosed with an ear inflammation way back and the symptoms included severe vertigo to the point that I couldn't stand without getting dizzy. As in parang yung sa mga sci-fi movies na umaalon yung paligid, yung pader, yung mga gamit. Couldn't move without vomitting on the first day. I was even planning on asking my family to take me to the ER pero narealize ko wala naman kaming pera so tiniis ko na lang hanggang mag subside ng konti by the second day. 

On the third day, I went to an ENT doctor and had some tests. I was asked kung ano daw huli kong kinain before ako magkavertigo and, voila!, I ate a bar of toblerone. So ayun, kinonfirm ni doc na yung caffeine at high sodium ay bawal na from then on. 

Ngayon, every time may naamoy akong kape nasusuka na agad ako haha from the 4 times a day na coffee to no coffee at all. Pag may friends na nag aabot ng chocolates nahihiya akong tanggapin kasi alam kong hindi ko rin naman makakain loool.  

Virtual hugs with consent to people with caffeine-free diet like me haha ano pangpagising niyo na hindi kape, baka pwedeng ma-apply sa akin üòÇ",1,1743941760.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

1jssr2j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jssr2j,"""Old"" American Chinese food showdown in California!","While I'm not a big fan of American Chinese food, it's interesting to see what some of the ""historic"" (long running) or else just stuck-in-the-past restaurants offer.

I'm not talking about General Zuo's/Orange Chicken variety of American Chinese food, but rather the kind that evokes mid-20th century and earlier.

Truth be told, I usually end up disliking the food, more or less‚Äînot because I am prejudiced against it, just because it's not to my taste. The experience ends up become more like something that was just fun and interesting to visit and see what they offer.

But two of these places were OK, and one of those I was pretty happy with.

The ""winner"" is **Chicago Caf√© in Woodland, California**. The current claim is that they are the oldest continually operating Chinese restaurant in America.

Chicago Caf√© is a legit diner in its own right that also happens to sell very retro Chinese food.

Slide 1 shows their combo plate with fried rice, egg fu yung, fried shrimp, and chow mein. The ""chow mein"" consists of ""chop suey"" on top of the crispy La Choy thingies. They also offer it on top of different types of noodle. The plate is preceded by a bowl of vegetable soup and saltines, diner style. The bits of BBQ pork on top of it all remind me of the instructions in most recipes in Shiu Wong Chan's The Chinese Cook Book (1917), which always says ""garnish with Chinese ham""! The gravy on the fu yung dan is a thin, soy one. I finished it all‚Äîeven though I was mad for making the mistake of getting the La Choy noodles. (I thought by crispy noodles they meant it would be like ‰∏§Èù¢ÈªÑ.) Cup of endless refill diner coffee to wash it down.

Next is **Bill Lee's Bamboo Chopsticks in Bakersfield**. I tried to get a similar ""combo plate."" It was also preceded by a soup and oyster crackers, but the soup was just like some awfully salty Knorr chicken powder broth.

Slide two shows the plate with ""almond diced chicken chow mein,"" long ""bbq spare ribs,"" fried shrimp (with lemon wedge!) and fried rice.  
Awful bland slurry of ""almond diced chicken"" on top, this time, plain soft noodles. Nothing ""chow"" about it. Bland fried rice. Was hilariously warned about the side mustard ""If you haven't had it before"" that it would be spicy. Could not finish it all...too bland and heavy. At least they give the traditional pot of oolong tea.

Next is **Tong Fong Low in Oroville**. Possibly, the ""third oldest Chinese restaurant in America."" They mix dishes that seem like they could be similar to the earliest days with some of the more recent American Chinese dishes.

Pictured in Slide 3 is their chop suey with pork. In classic style, the chop suey is mainly bean sprouts. I ordered it to imagine what their popular dish might have been back in the day. Though I don't love chop suey in any form, this was decent. There was nothing thick and stewed about it. It was just sprouts lightly stir fried with pork and cabbage thrown in, and I could imagine this among normal/authentic Chinese cooking.

Then comes an odd one, **Mee Heng Low in San Luis Obispo**. It stands in SLO's former Chinatown as a place established in the 1920s. However, with the changes in ownership over the years and with about zero Asian people in the area, I feel like the current iteration is just making things up. All the food looks like an English person who had never eaten Chinese food might just invent out of the imagination and without proper access to ingredients.

Slide 4, believe it or not, is their chop suey with pork. Compare it to the previous Tong Fong Low to see how bizarre it is. It's primarily noodles, undercooked. The pork is weird pork loin medallions sliced in half. All the dishes include some weird strips of carrot. There is watery soy sauce at the bottom of the bowl. It tastes like no other seasoning. Did I say weird? I just don't get what they're thinking.

Last is the scariest one. **Hong Kong Chop Suey in Hanford**. Very retro, but not necessarily very old at all, but rather more owing to the tastes in this remote rural area.

Slide 5 is chow mein (combo or house style, I guess). On the La Choy crispies. They there in every California farm vegetable imaginable. Strange slices of country ham just placed on top. In the back is thick, doughy egg fu yung with some yellow gravy. I took two bites and could not continue. I felt bad and the server was really confused why I would want to just leave without finishing and without taking the leftovers. It was that bad.

I'd go back to Chicago Caf√© any time, maybe pair a Chinese dish with some bacon and eggs. Hanford I'd never go back to; if in town, just eat a burger at a fast food restaurant. Tong Fong Low is a good lunch, if you order the right dishes, if you're visiting Chinese history in the area. Don't bother with San Luis Obispo. Eat Mexican food, instead, in Bakersfield!",1,1743941667.0,chinesefood2,0,1.0,False

Since then I have tried different ways to try and make it, but I find that it never really mixes with milk, and remains too coarse for a black coffee. I generally enjoy my coffee cold with a splash of cream but since I have bought this one, I really want to try and make it in an authentic way.

If anyone of you can help me on this, please feel free to drop in your methods below. Thanks!",2,1743941583.0,srilanka,0,1.0,False

1jssq6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1jssq6o/stimulants_began_to_cause_right_sided_shoulder/,Stimulants began to cause right sided shoulder and neck and jaw pain when I became more psychotic - Lurasidone took it away?,"Schizoaffective bipolar type. 28 years old female. 

It‚Äôs bizarre. At later 25, restarting just ten mg of Dexedrine began to hurt my right shoulder - and this was right when I began to really decompensate psychotically. I‚Äôve been on and off Vyvanse and Dexedrine since I was 18 with no problems. 

Dexedrine and Vyvanse also stopped working for me; no focus, no good feelings, just pain and decompensation - and a movement disorder. 

I eventually started Lurasidone 40mg (later 60mg) and it took away the pain. It also made ADHD medication work 1000x better than they should bad produce extreme euphoria. 

Then I went off of Lurasidone, since it caused a stimulant use disorder with the ADHD meds, and the pain came back - excruciatingly due to Vyvanse I was on. I was taken off of Vyvanse fully at an IP, but now even coffee or nicotine causes it and I often need Tylenol. 

My entire upper right sided is crackily and knotted, and it goes into my head and jaw, and joints in the area. It really hurts. 

They put me on what is now 300MG of Seroquel and 900MG of lithium. It‚Äôs almost been three weeks since I‚Äôve been here; it doesn‚Äôt seem like the Seroquel is doing much in multiple ways. 

I can‚Äôt restart Lurasidone since it caused a stimulant use disorder.

1jssms3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Non_Medical_ADHD/comments/1jssms3/continuing_my_vendetta_against_anxietythinking_by/,continuing my vendetta against anxiety/thinking by setting up 'automated' / 'organic' things,"here are a couple of things (my life is filled with these and i might more-fully inventory them later but the point is that you can do the same) that now 'take care of themselves' as a result of fine-tuning my SOPs/rituals/routine/habits over the last five years:

*side note: i should also mention that many enhancements of my procedures have also been a result of pure serendipity. last thing before i list out these things is that dedicating time to introspection vs distractions is accelerating opportunity identification and habit formation.*

**milk inventory**

i don't drink much milk and hate throwing milk away and, no, i'm not going to freeze it. 

so i started buying a smaller portion of milk that happens to also be UHT (ultra-high temperature pasteurized, or whatever). 

this means that it has a very long shelf life until it's opened. this allows me to buy and store as many as i want without having to worry about it going bad.

...which is great bc i can always have plenty on hand for when my milk-guzzling daughters are over.

even with the smaller size, however, i was finding that i was still sometimes not fully consuming the container before it needed to be thrown out.

i solved this by deciding to eat oatmeal every morning, which contains all the nutrition that the alternatives which don't consume as much milk have.

eating oatmeal everyday not only solves the consumption problem, but now i no longer if need to label the container with the data that i opened it bc now i will always drink the full container before it goes bad.

i did have one remaining problem, though, in that the grocery sometimes didn't have this particular milk.

this was easily solved by just buying a few extra to get me through any dry spells, which are roughly once every five or six trips.

so, for now at least, my milk problem is solved and i do zero thinking about it.

**closing the microwave after letting it 'dry out' post-use**

yes, the premise of this is quite silly / OCD but somehow i *feel* like the microwave door needs to stay open to let moisture out even though i *know* this isn't the case. 

that aside, how do i remember to close the microwave door after leaving it open?

turns out i don't need to remember to close the microwave door because i'm automatically going to 'collide' with it when i access the sink to rinse off my hands after slicing the banana which is the last ingredient that goes into my oatmeal after which enough time as elapsed to satisfy my ridiculous OCD regarding microwave moisture.

**forcing myself to get away from desk by NOT using my Yeti tumbler for my coffee**

because i'm content to savor my coffee and doing things on my computer (like writing this post, recording videos/podcasts, and any computer-related tasks) in the mornings, i'm at risk of completely burning my entire morning at the computer which, while fun, presents obvious opportunity costs when i have adulting to do.

...not to mention i'm bad enough at task-switching as it is and, to add insult to injury, i have a Yeti coffee tumbler that will keep my coffee warm all morning.

...so I went back to my low-tech coffee mug... 

https://preview.redd.it/f77g6564b7te1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=470260923468d2c6ba2cf5e3c2da092b2fc9dc16

...which forces me to periodically get away from my desk to microwave my coffee.

this serves two purposes. 1) it forces me to get up periodically which is good in it's own right 

...and 2) being forced to get up makes it easier for me to task switch because i've formed a habit of 'checking in' on where i am in the day (incl what time it is bc time blindness) whenever i transition from one thing to another which helps to snap me out of whatever i'm hyperfocusing on.

*side note: while i'm at it i should mention that i also have a 'coffee > water > floss teeth' alarm that goes off every morning at 7am that i keep snoozing until i make it through the whole process and floss my teeth. the snoozing reminds me to drink my coffee/water bc otherwise i'll forget.*

**checking whiteboard for scheduled items > backlog/'wander' items**

i've already written many times about my monthly planner > whiteboard todo list > scrutinize (A.D.A.M./S.A.F.E.) / filter ('never critical' but value-added) / prioritization (food > hygiene > exercise) process.

now, while this process dramatically reduces thinking, i always knew i wasn't going to be satisfied until i could eliminate thinking 100%.

yesterday, i put in place the following procedure:

1) if anything is 'scheduled' for now, do it  
2) otherwise, when idle, 'pull' things from the right side of whiteboard instead of TV/social/guitar

*for folks new to this sub, 'scheduled' means that something is now actionable; not necessarily required to do. thus, the intention is to put things on the left/schedule side of my whiteboard that CANNOT be done until a certain time, e.g. i can't go to the grocery until 10am when the meat department opens.*

*...and since i can't act on the 'grocery' task, i don't want it to cloud the things i CAN immediately act on.*

*it's critically important that everything on my whiteboard is actionable because i don't want to have to perform EF which is highly demotivating.*

*this is why setting myself up for a day of non-thinking is so important while i'm highly caffeinated in the morning.*

ok that's enough for now. i might add more (i have dozens; maybe hundreds of these) things to this post as i think about them as i use them in my daily life or maybe i'll just create a new post with those things or maybe just new things i develop.

if you're interested in such, lemme know bc it's very motivating to know that there's interest in something; even if it's just a single person who could benefit.

last thing is i want to mention the power of habit formation and wiring my brain and consistently exaggerating things to develop these connections. 

for example, when i realized that i was naturally colliding with the open microwave door when rinsing my hands after slicing the banana for my oatmeal, i decided to keep leaving the microwave door open (even after i admitted that it's stupid to leave the door open).

but this wired my brain for that and, serendipitously, became a reminder TO wiring my brain IN GENERAL, i.e. this became a STRATEGY REMINDER.

you see, one of the hardest things to accomplish with adhd is to implement/manage/remember all the great strategies we could implement if we could only remember them.

thus, anything we can do to build in an automatic reminder, e.g. 'collisions', 'cues', 'intersections', etc. help to provide daily reminders themselves but also reminders to be consistent so that our brains get wired so that we can move on to the next wiring so that we can accumulate a stacked set of wired behaviors such that we can operate in the world with minimal thinking!

*ok i lied about the thing above being the last thing but i'm going to make this last example the last thing.*

i wrote recently about developing habits to take more control of my reddit / you tube consumption by using saves and Watch Later. 

as i mention in the post/audio, the process started with a natural move toward using saves / Watch Later which i capitalized on by writing about it and then 'saving' that post so i'd see my goal of using saves whenever i went into saves.

i then realized that, every time i use reddit, i do so using an Edge browser link from the default home screen and that i could simply modify that so now i START from the saves every time i access reddit.

anyway, do what you want with that. i'm just trying to share my experiences and i continue to FOCUS and ALLOW MYSELF to INVEST in stopping thinking. ***YOU CAN TOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!***",1,1743941250.0,Non_Medical_ADHD,0,1.0,False

Now they are becoming friendly again and I don't know if I should tell her.,"Last year me and my ex of five years broke up when her BFF messaged me telling me that my Ex had been very inappropriate towards her during their last night out. Trying to kiss her, groping her etc. My ex had also been in the possession of cocaine without letting her friend know. Yet if she'd been caught then both would get arrested. We proceed to exchange messages and her messages heavily indicated that my Ex had cheated on me before. Something I confronted my ex about and she confirmed it in-between crying fits. Apparently she'd cheated on me two years ago. F*ckin-A..

We broke up and I was a shattered mess after this. My ex and her BFF cut contact between each other as well. I felt such an immense gratitude to the BFF for coming forward and we became friends during this time. She helped me get my life back on track and we both supported each other. I think she mostly felt guilty, while being hurt herself and this was a way to atone. We actually grew very close and somewhere along the lines she started making sexual comments towards me, something I shrugged off as just being nice. But tensions between us grew and one night when she was out of town she confessed that she'd been having fantasies about me and she'd want to make them a reality. I was completely starved for intimacy and in some messed up way it did feel good as a way to spite my ex. We became FWB and we'd hook up a couple of times a week. This lasted for a several months until she got pregnant, but we resumed hooking up after her abortion. At some point our feelings grew for each other and she even claimed that I was the love of her life. But the she started a new job with really awkward hours and we slowly started drifting apart. We'd still talk on the phone once a week, but the magic fizzled out, I guess.

She called me earlier this week to let me know  that she and my ex were going to a coffee shop to talk things out, but that she wasn't gonna tell her about us. During this whole time, my ex has been trying to contact me apologizeing over and over again, but her BFF kept telling me to move on.

I agreed to help because I care about her, but now that she‚Äôs been here for a couple of days, I‚Äôm honestly regretting it.

She‚Äôs only been here for two days, but I already feel overwhelmed. I‚Äôm a pretty clean and routine-oriented person, and I‚Äôm sensitive to smells and clutter. I knew she had some challenges with hygiene and keeping things tidy, but I didn‚Äôt realize how hard it would be to deal with that in my own space.

She hasn‚Äôt been showering properly, and there‚Äôs a strong smell that lingers after she walks around or sits on the furniture. It‚Äôs uncomfortable, and I don‚Äôt know how to bring it up without hurting her feelings. She‚Äôs also been openly farting on my couch and even on the pillows, and then just laughs about it. It‚Äôs honestly gross and it‚Äôs making it hard to feel comfortable in my own home.

She leaves trash around, and I have to constantly remind her to clean up after herself. She‚Äôs sleeping on the floor because I don‚Äôt have a guest bed, but I don‚Äôt want her on the living room couch either. I don‚Äôt trust that she won‚Äôt stay up all night watching Netflix or messing with my stuff. I also really don‚Äôt want the couch to get ruined from constant use.

Tonight I had to ask her to shower after we were out all day and she was sweaty. She wanted to take a bath, which just feels like sitting in dirty water, and it uses up hot water. I shower every night as part of my wind-down routine, so I really didn‚Äôt want to wait over an hour to use my own bathroom.

She also goes to bed super early‚Äîlike 7pm‚Äîand wants to use my room, even though I‚Äôve told her not to lay on my bed. Tonight she was on the phone with her family in my room while I was in the shower, lying on my bed without underwear. I ended up having to spray everything down because I just felt really grossed out and disrespected. I also worry that she‚Äôs using my personal products, and I can‚Äôt afford to replace things casually because I‚Äôm on a tight budget.

It‚Äôs been really hard to relax. I usually stay up late to read or watch my shows, but she complains about the noise or talks through them, which ruins the experience for me. She‚Äôs also super loud when she‚Äôs on the phone, even late at night.

I‚Äôve also been feeding her, even though I‚Äôm on limited food stamps and she just got approved for her own. She does stuff like take shots of hot sauce, then casually ask to drink my coffee creamer‚Äîwhich is the only one I can afford for the month. That stuff adds up, and it really bugged me.

What really breaks my heart though is how this is affecting my emotional support cat. He‚Äôs very shy and bonded to me, but since she‚Äôs been here, he‚Äôs hiding and won‚Äôt sleep with me. I‚Äôve asked her to leave him alone, but she keeps trying to pet him and get close. It feels like even my bond with him is being disrupted, and it‚Äôs really upsetting.

I‚Äôve been trying so hard to be understanding, but I‚Äôm reaching my breaking point. My space doesn‚Äôt feel like mine anymore. I can‚Äôt sleep properly, I can‚Äôt focus, and I feel anxious and disregulated. I want to talk to her, but I don‚Äôt know how to bring up these things without her shutting down or getting hurt. I don‚Äôt want to be mean, but I feel like I‚Äôm disappearing in my own home.

Part of me is even considering asking my apartment manager to come up with a reason for her to leave, just so it doesn‚Äôt have to come directly from me. I know that‚Äôs not ideal, but I‚Äôm so stressed I just want peace again. I want to sleep with my cat by my side, enjoy my quiet time, and feel like I have control over my space again.

I really do want to be a good friend, but this is so much harder than I thought it would be. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.",3,1743941002.0,confession,3,1.0,False

----------------------------------------------

Tiny homes are gaining popularity as people seek simpler, more sustainable lifestyles. However, making the most out of a small living space requires innovative space-saving designs. Here are some efficient designs that maximize space while ensuring functionality and comfort.

### Multipurpose Furniture

One of the best solutions for tiny homes is to invest in multipurpose furniture. This type of furniture serves more than one function, which reduces the need for individual pieces:

- **Sofa Beds:** Transforming a cozy sofa into a bed can save significant space during the day, allowing you to use the area for other activities.
- **Storage Ottomans:** An ottoman can provide both seating and hidden storage for blankets or books.
- **Foldable Tables:** Tables that can collapse when not in use are perfect for dining or working, and they free up valuable floor space.

### Vertical Storage Solutions

Going vertical is a must in tiny homes. Utilizing wall space can significantly increase your storage capacity:

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/what-are-some-efficient-designs-for-a-tiny-home  
  
- **Wall Shelves:** Install shelves close to the ceiling for books, plants, or decorative items. This keeps your floor area open while displaying your favorite belongings.
- **Hanging Racks:** Use hooks or racks to store kitchen utensils or tools in the kitchen or garage, freeing up counter and drawer space.
- **Lofted Beds:** Raise the bed into a loft, creating room underneath for a workspace or cozy reading nook.

### Built-In Storage Features

Built-in storage can seamlessly blend with your home‚Äôs design while providing essential functionality:

- **Under-Stair Storage:** If your tiny home has stairs, utilize that space for cabinets, drawers, or shelves.
- **Window Seats:** Create a window seat with built-in storage. It provides seating while also offering a place to keep blankets or books.
- **Integrated Kitchen Storage:** Consider cabinets that extend to the ceiling to maximize vertical space in your kitchen.

### Compact Appliances

When designing a tiny home, choosing the right appliances is essential:

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/what-are-some-efficient-designs-for-a-tiny-home  
  
- **Combo Washer-Dryer:** This appliance saves space by allowing you to wash and dry clothes in one machine.
- **Slim Refrigerators:** Opt for narrower refrigerators without sacrificing essential features.
- **Two-Burner Stoves:** Instead of a full-size range, choose a compact two-burner stove that takes up less room.

### Creative Room Dividers

In a tiny home, defining spaces can be tricky. Here are some clever ideas:

- **Bookshelves as Dividers:** Use tall bookshelves to separate areas while providing additional storage for books and decor.
- **Sliding Doors:** These save space by not swinging open and can afford you privacy when necessary.
- **Fabric Partitions:** Lightweight curtains can separate rooms, allowing you to customize your space based on your needs at any given time.

### Outdoor Integration

Bringing the outdoors in can enhance your tiny home living experience:

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/what-are-some-efficient-designs-for-a-tiny-home  
  
- **Porches and Decks:** Use outdoor space for relaxation or entertaining. A well-designed porch can act as an extension of your living area.
- **Garden Walls:** A vertical garden on an exterior wall can provide both beauty and fresh produce without taking up precious ground space.
- **Foldable Outdoor Furniture:** Use furniture that can be easily stored when not in use to maximize function during outdoor gatherings.

By incorporating these innovative space-saving designs into your tiny home, you can create a comfortable dwelling that feels spacious, organized, and stylish. Utilize every square foot effectively and turn your small space into a functional haven. With creativity and the right designs, living in a tiny home can be both enjoyable and efficient.

The Importance of Multi-Functional Furniture in Tiny Home Living
----------------------------------------------------------------

Living in a tiny home is an exciting adventure that comes with unique challenges. One of the most pressing challenges is how to maximize space while maintaining comfort and functionality. This is where multi-functional furniture plays a crucial role. Smartly designed furniture not only saves space but also enhances the overall living experience in these cozy abodes.

When you're in a tiny home, every inch counts. Multi-functional furniture serves more than one purpose, allowing you to utilize your space efficiently. Here are some key designs to consider:

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/what-are-some-efficient-designs-for-a-tiny-home  
  
- **These versatile pieces can act as a sofa during the day and convert into a bed at night. This is perfect for tiny homes where dedicated sleeping areas may be limited.**
- **A coffee table that opens up to reveal storage is vital. You can use it to store books, games, or blankets while keeping the living area neat and tidy.**
- **Tables and chairs that fold up can be a game changer. You can easily set up a dining area when necessary and tuck them away afterward, freeing up precious space.**
- **Elevating your bed to create storage underneath maximizes sleeping space. Utilize this area for seasonal clothes or extra bedding.**
- **If you work from home or enjoy crafts, a desk that can alternately serve as a dining table is not only practical but also space-saving.**

Choosing multi-functional furniture helps ensure your tiny home feels spacious and inviting, rather than cramped. It permits flexibility, enabling you to adapt the space based on your current needs. Imagine hosting friends without being constrained by traditional furniture layouts‚Äîtransformable pieces allow for various configurations.

Another major benefit of investing in multi-functional furniture is how it can enhance your home's design. Furniture that serves multiple purposes often features modern aesthetics, blending style with functionality. To illustrate:

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/what-are-some-efficient-designs-for-a-tiny-home  
  
- **An armoire can act as a wardrobe and a media center, serving both storage and entertainment needs.**
- **These stylish tables can stack together when not in use or be spread out for larger gatherings, making them perfect for tight spaces.**
- **Providing both seating and sleeping arrangements, sleeper sofas are excellent for those who regularly host guests.**

In addition to the aesthetic advantages, the right multi-functional furniture can provide more effective use of your available space. For instance, chairs that can serve as stools or side tables offer both seating and surface area when hosting visitors. This versatility reduces clutter, making for a more organized space.

It‚Äôs essential to choose quality multi-functional furniture to endure the daily wear and tear that often comes with tiny home living. Look for durable materials and construction that can withstand a busy lifestyle. Also, consider the design‚Äîfurniture should reflect your personal style while being practical.

Customization can significantly enhance your tiny home experience. Some companies specialize in creating bespoke multi-functional furniture that caters to individual needs. Think about your lifestyle. If you frequently work from home, a desk that can be converted into a dining table might be your best option. By personalizing your furniture, you can ensure that your tiny home truly feels like home.

Multi-functional furniture into your tiny home design can drastically improve your living experience. You can create a space that is not just functional but also stylish and efficient. Embrace small living with smart furniture solutions that adapt to your lifestyle needs and enjoy every moment in your tiny haven.

### Conclusion

Creating a tiny home doesn‚Äôt mean sacrificing comfort or style; it invites you to think creatively about your space. Through innovative space-saving designs, tiny homes can maximize every square inch, turning challenges into exciting opportunities. Whether it‚Äôs utilizing vertical storage solutions, folding walls, or modular designs, there are countless ways to make a small space feel expansive and functional.

Moreover, the significance of multi-functional furniture cannot be overstated in tiny home living. Pieces that serve dual purposes not only save space but also streamline your daily routine. Consider a sofa bed that doubles as a seating area and sleeping space, or an expandable dining table that can be tucked away when not in use. Such thoughtful designs not only enhance the usability of your home but also promote a simpler, more organized lifestyle.

By embracing these efficient designs and innovative furniture solutions, you can transform a tiny home into a cozy and practical environment tailored to your needs. It‚Äôs all about maximizing the potential of your available space while maintaining a sense of comfort and charm. Tiny living encourages sustainability and creativity, allowing you to enjoy a fulfilling life while minimizing your ecological footprint. With the right strategies in place, your tiny home can offer all the functions you need while celebrating the beauty of simplicity. Dive into this exciting adventure of tiny living and discover the joy of a well-designed space that maximizes both comfort and functionality.

1jssi3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedCars/comments/1jssi3p/3_strikes_and_all_missed/,"3 strikes, and all missed?!","Should I immediatedly put down a deposit for a car that I see online now?!

I've had 3 strike-outs.  Short story:

Car #1: Drove 1.5 hours to a high-end dealer for a test drive.  I'd talked to the salesman the day before to arrive when they open.  I arrive 15mins late, OK; and the salesman tells me to wait because the car is being test driven by another customer.  OK, I grab coffee at the dealer, wait 10mins, then tell the salesmen to call me when the car is back as I run errands nearby.  He calls me back 45 minutes later and says the car sold.

Car #2: Drove 1 hour to a different reputable dealer for another test drive.  Again, I'd set up the test drive the day before to arrive when the dealer opens.  As I'm arriving 5 mins EARLY this time, just down the street from the dealer, the salesman calls me and says the car sold.  WTF?!  I ask about the process for buying, and he says buyer got a quote sheet and immediatedly put down their deposit.  It sounds like the buyer never test drove the car.

Car #3: The salesman for Car #2 calls me later the same day as I'm driving back home.  He says their franchise just got a trade-in on the same make, model, year but higher mileage; and asked if I'm interested.  I tell him yes, and ask which lot this new trade-in is at so I can test drive it that same day.  He mentions the quote sheet and deposit, but I tell him that I want to drive the car 1st -- online pics don't show details, the smell of the car, etc.  He says all their cars are inspected.  Hours go by, I arrive back home, and text the salesman about the quote sheet for this new trade-in.  He replies that it's sold!  WHAT!  The trade-in arrives in the previous evening/that morning, and is sold by the afternoon?! 

Are people buying cars sight unseen?!

For the curious, Car #1 was a Subaru Outback, and Car #2 & #3 are Buick TourX.  So used wagons.  

Maybe its my nearby market.  200+ miles away, and these cars just sit on lots for weeks.  I can't take off work right now to test drive those cars that are farther away.

I've been through a lot in my life. 30, male. A lot of sadness and anger which I gotten over with the help of my brother, 2 best friends and girlfried. Just by talking. And drinking a lot.

I had high blood pressure on new year's this year. Like ER needed high blood pressure. Which lowered with close to zero medication. I am taking meds for high blood pressure for the last 25 years. Yup, genetics suck. Since this happened I stopped drinking ALMOST completely (I drink a glass or 2 of wine every week or so) and I lost 8 kg (and still counting) and I started cycling/walking almost every day. In 3 months it got slowly better. When I need to talk about it my girlfriend is there for me. Or my brother or my friends. 

However, I am afraid of drinking alcohol or anything that gets me hyped or raises my heart rate, which is most of the stuff I did before (billiards, drinking with friends, etc.). So I changed my lifestyle. 

Then my dad suffered a brain stroke, which is caused by... high blood pressure. So my panic and mental health took a swing like never before. This is fear I'm dealing with. Which is completely new to me, not anger and not sadness. So I went to a psychotherapist and realized it's not for me. He did point out some interesting stuff, like how come coffee doesn't irritate me or smoking, which is also bad for blood pressure. It's like I'm selecting what is bad for me and isn't. But with the shaking happening and stuff, he said my body is trying to tell me something...

And now I'm here. I do take 99% natural based (passion flower) pills to sleep and I still wake up mid nights from.. I don't know what reason but I believe it's mentally related. 

My blood pressure is within normal range of what it should be and I function every day normally, I go to work, I do stuff around the house it's just when I calm down and lie down it starts to happen. 

I've been to my doctor and she said my blood pressure is high from past mental issues. I know I've had them but I've always tried to solve them. Because that's how I'm built, to always find a solution.

I've never been depressed or think about death, I'm afraid of it happening to me and my loved ones.

And now I need to find something to help myself. I'm thinking something like books. Any advice?",1,1743940807.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

Celebrating the Joy of Engaging Friends: ""Hi Friends, My Marriage is Fixed!""
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you have exciting news, you want to share it with the world. Imagine the joy of telling your friends, ‚ÄúHi friends, my marriage is fixed!‚Äù Sharing this important milestone can create unforgettable memories, deepen connections, and spread happiness all around. Here‚Äôs how to celebrate this joyful news with your friends and make the moment even more special.

The first step in sharing your news is choosing the right moment. You want to make sure your friends can fully appreciate and celebrate with you. Consider gathering them in a comfortable setting‚Äîperhaps at your favorite coffee shop or during a casual picnic in the park. When you feel relaxed, you can enjoy the reactions and excitement from your friends.

Once you‚Äôve set the moment, think about how you want to break the news. You can choose to announce it in a fun and creative way that reflects your personality. Here are some ideas:

- **Host a small gathering:** Invite your closest friends over for dinner. As the meal progresses, casually drop the news and enjoy their surprise.
- **Create a social media post:** If you love to share your life online, consider posting a cute picture of you with your partner and caption it, ‚ÄúHi friends, my marriage is fixed!‚Äù
- **Send personalized messages:** A heartfelt text message or an email can make your friends feel special. Share your joy directly and invite them to celebrate with you.

When your friends hear the wonderful news, expect a flood of excitement and questions. They may want to know details about the wedding date, venue, and plans. Be prepared to share what you have ready, even if it's just a rough outline. This will not only satisfy their curiosity but will also give them a sense of involvement as you embark on this new chapter in your life.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
Don‚Äôt forget to embrace their excitement! Friends may want to offer advice or share their own experiences‚Äîbe open to listening. This mutual sharing can strengthen your friendship as you find joy in each other‚Äôs journeys. Remind them how important their support is during this time. You may want to thank them for being part of your life, especially on this joyous occasion.

Another way to celebrate this milestone is by creating shared experiences leading up to the big day. Consider involving your friends in the wedding preparations. Even if it‚Äôs just assigning small tasks or asking for their opinions, it shows that you value their input. Some ways to involve your friends include:

- **Planning a bridal shower:** You could ask a close friend to help organize it, making everyone feel included.
- **Choosing bridesmaids or groomsmen:** If you have a close-knit group, include them in your wedding party.
- **Setting up joint outings:** Arrange group activities‚Äîdinner, game nights, or movie marathons‚Äîto keep the joyful spirit alive.

As you prepare for your marriage, remember that communicating is key. Regularly updating your friends about your journey not only keeps them informed but makes them feel part of your experience. Sharing your excitement, challenges, and progress will strengthen your bond, making it even more celebratory when the big day arrives.

Babka, a sweet braided bread with Eastern European Jewish origins, has become a beloved treat in American baking, often featuring rich chocolate fillings. This vegan version delivers all the indulgence of traditional babka without eggs or dairy. Below is a step-by-step guide to making your own vegan chocolate babka.



Ingredients

For the Dough:
4 cups all-purpose or bread flour

‚Öì cup granulated sugar

2¬º teaspoons instant yeast

¬Ω teaspoon salt

1 cup unsweetened plant-based milk (e.g., almond, soy, or oat)

¬Ω cup vegan butter (softened)

¬Ω cup unsweetened plant-based yogurt or applesauce

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

For the Chocolate Filling:
¬Ω cup vegan butter (softened)

¬Ω cup vegan chocolate chips

‚Öî cup powdered sugar

‚Öì cup cocoa powder

Optional: 1 tablespoon black cocoa powder for deeper flavor

For the Syrup:
¬º cup water

¬º cup brown sugar

Equipment
Stand mixer with a dough hook (or a large mixing bowl and your hands)

Rolling pin

Sharp knife or serrated blade

Two loaf pans (9 x 5 inches)

Parchment paper

Instructions

1. Prepare the Dough
Warm the plant-based milk to about 100‚Äì110¬∞F (40‚Äì45¬∞C) and mix it with the yeast. Let it sit for 5 minutes until foamy.

In a stand mixer bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the yeast mixture, plant-based yogurt or applesauce, and vanilla extract.

Mix on medium speed until a rough dough forms.

Gradually add softened vegan butter in small chunks, kneading until fully incorporated. Continue kneading for about 8‚Äì10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.

Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with a towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm spot for about 1‚Äì2 hours until doubled in size.

2. Make the Chocolate Filling
Melt the vegan butter and chocolate chips in a double boiler or microwave.

Stir in powdered sugar and cocoa powder until smooth.

Let the filling cool slightly to thicken before spreading.

3. Shape the Babka
Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into two equal portions.

Roll out one portion into a rectangle approximately 18 x 12 inches (45 x 30 cm).

Spread half of the chocolate filling evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.

Roll the dough tightly from one long edge into a log and pinch to seal.

Using a sharp knife, slice the log lengthwise into two halves to expose the layers of filling.

Position the halves cut-side up and twist them together into a braid.

Transfer the braid into a parchment-lined loaf pan.

Repeat with the second portion of dough.

4. Final Rise

Cover both loaf pans loosely with plastic wrap or a towel.

Let them rise in a warm spot for about 30‚Äì40 minutes until puffy.

5. Bake

Preheat your oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C).

Bake for about 40‚Äì50 minutes until golden brown and an inserted skewer comes out clean.

6. Add Syrup
While the babkas are baking, prepare the syrup by heating water and brown sugar in a saucepan over medium heat until dissolved.

Brush the syrup generously over warm babkas immediately after removing them from the oven.

Tips for Success
Overnight Dough Rest: For enhanced flavor and easier handling, refrigerate the dough overnight after its first rise.

Use Room Temperature Ingredients: This ensures even mixing and better texture.

Don‚Äôt Skip the Syrup: It keeps your babka moist and shiny while adding sweetness.

Serving Suggestions
Serve slices of babka warm or at room temperature with coffee or tea for breakfast or as an indulgent dessert.

I have a remote cottage that's hard to access, with all of the constant maintenance and major reconstruction projects it requires pretty much full-time attention. I had a week of vacation and went up alone with the intention of putting in full, productive days and get a big head start for the season. Planned everything out on paper and spent an entire day loading up materials in and on top of my van, transfered everything into my boat, then 7 slow chugging miles across the lake.
150 feet up 50 stairs then up the path to it's destination.
Beer time!
Poured a beer but had a double vodka oj that I chugged while my beer was settling. Had a nice dinner by my fireplace and drank a bottle of wine while intermittently slamming back vodka mixers when ""needed.""
Woke up at 3am in a panic and had another one to get back to sleep.
Woke up at 9 and was already behind schedule, guilt got me out of bed and right to work. Kind of slower than ideal kind of day but still productive enough and at 3pm called it a day.
3:30 was about as late as I could wait so, rinse repeat drinking patterns and by 6 I was lit. Barely scraped dinner together and ate it in front of the tv!  Woke up an hour later with alfredo pasta all over my lap, recliner and some on the floor. Drink time and clean up, got a second wind and drank until I blacked out. Woke up at 3am again but sideways in my chair. Stiff drink to get back to bed and now it's 11am. Got out of bed and wandered around trying to get my head together. Dove in the lake and chugged my coffee. 
Dragged my groggy self to my tools and made a few measurements and cuts, but the overwhelming shame got me and I couldn't keep going. 
Lied to myself that a small shot would wake me up and suppress those feelings. It worked, so I kept drinking, woke up at 7:30pm thinking it was the next day and I was pissed to find out it was still today. Drank until I passed out and then proceeded to drink myself stupid for 5 straight days. Now it was a cycle between being passed out, then drinking until I pass out again! 
Barely ate another meal even though I had planned my indulgent menu out quite well.
By the end of the week I had accomplished nothing, I left in failure with the worst hangover and black clouds of remorse washing over me for days.
2 months sober and I'm out of bed at 5am everyday with a feeling of calmness and peace, mixed with a renewed sense of purpose and hope!

I had 14k in a Monzo savings account waiting for today so I moved it all to my Monzo flexible cash ISA (without thinking) with the aim of putting 6.4k into my Vanguard S&S ISA in the next few weeks (probably 1-2k a week given the market at the moment, just to DCA a little bit). 
I also invest 300 a month from my salary so 3600 will be going into Vanguard this year.

I should have waited until I was more awake after my coffee, as I realised that if I‚Äôve already deposited 14k to Monzo, and will be depositing 3.6k to Vanguard over the year, I can‚Äôt get 6.4k out of the Monzo flexible ISA and into Vanguard as this would make my total ISA deposits 24k as any money taken out of Monzo would need to be put back into the same ISA.

My aim is to have:

- 3.6k going into Vanguard over the course of the year. 
- 6.4k into Vanguard over the next month. 
- 7.6k left in Monzo cash ISA as we are renovating the house and need this liquid. 

As both ISAs are flexible, the best solution I can see to achieve this is withdraw 4k from Monzo (as they don‚Äôt allow partial transfers), then do an ISA transfer to Vanguard for the remaining 10k. Then withdraw 3.6k from Vanguard and replace this from my salary @ 300 a month. I would then have the 7.6k outside an ISA that I would want back in a cash ISA. 

My questions for this sub are, how much of my allowance would I have left if I did this? As I withdrew 4k from my Monzo before the transfer does that mean I have 10k deposited so 10k left? Or (as I suspect) do I have 6k (net) left after I replace the 3.6 over the year because I deposited 14k before the transfer from Monzo? 
Can I open another Monzo cash ISA this year and deposit the 7.6k?

# The Future of Sustainability: How Businesses Can Make a Real Impact

As companies worldwide grapple with the mounting challenges of climate change and environmental degradation, the push for corporate sustainability has never been more urgent. While the road to sustainable business practices is fraught with challenges, strategic planning can make all the difference. The latest insights from the Harvard Business Review's article, ""Getting Strategic About Sustainability,"" provide a practical roadmap for companies aiming to transition into more environmentally responsible operations. Here's a breakdown of the article's key points and how they can inform your sustainability journey.

## Focus on Key Issues

One of the primary takeaways from the Harvard Business Review piece is the importance of focus. Overloading sustainability initiatives with broad objectives can dilute the impact and effectiveness of a company's efforts. Instead, businesses should zero in on no more than six critical material issues. These issues can span environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors that directly tie to financial performance and stakeholder interests. Prioritizing these issues enables a sharper, more achievable focus on areas where companies can make a concrete difference while still aligning with overarching corporate goals. By addressing these key areas, firms can avoid spreading their resources too thin and ensure more significant outcomes.

## The Power of Stakeholder Engagement

Engaging stakeholders meaningfully is another cornerstone of effective sustainability strategies. Understanding and addressing the issues that stakeholders‚Äîbe it consumers, employees, or investors‚Äîfeel strongly about can drive impactful change. For instance, as concerns about the environmental cost of consumer goods, such as coffee pods, continue to grow, companies have an opportunity to innovate by adopting more sustainable packaging solutions. This not only addresses consumer anxieties but also positions companies as leaders in environmental responsibility. Building robust relationships with stakeholders doesn't just improve brand reputation; it opens up dialogues that can lead to budding innovations.

## Leveraging Science and Technology

For companies striving to enhance sustainability practices, leveraging science and technology is indispensable. Scientific approaches, like life cycle assessments, provide invaluable insights into how companies can improve their sustainability metrics. By focusing on data-driven evaluations, businesses can identify opportunities for innovation, such as developing more efficient recycling processes or reducing carbon footprints. Technology provides the tools necessary for achieving and measuring sustainability milestones, allowing businesses to move ahead with confidence in their environmental initiatives.

## Visual Storytelling

Visuals have the power to convey complex information simply and engagingly. In the realm of sustainability, visuals can effectively communicate a company's commitment to the cause. Utilizing infographics to highlight milestones or producing videos that showcase eco-friendly manufacturing processes can make sustainability efforts more tangible and relatable to a wider audience. These storytelling tools can better engage potential customers or partners, turning them into allies in a company's sustainability journey.

## Social Media Strategy

Promoting sustainability on social media platforms requires authenticity, transparency, and dynamism. Social media can serve as a powerful tool to educate audiences about environmental issues while demonstrating a brand's dedication to sustainable practices. Whether it's through sharing educational content or involving the audience in discussions about eco-friendly practices, companies can cultivate a community driven by shared values. By crafting a well-thought-out social media strategy, businesses can inspire action and maintain accountability in their sustainability commitments.

### Example Social Media Post Ideas

- ""Focus on what matters. Prioritize your sustainability efforts to make a real impact. Learn more about strategic sustainability from the @HarvardBiz Review: [Read more](https://hbr.org/2025/01/getting-strategic-about-sustainability)""
- ""Did you know? Consumers care about products they can touch and feel, like eco-friendly packaging. Innovate today and drive sustainability forward!""
- ""Let's talk sustainability. Share your favorite eco-friendly practices with us and inspire positive change.""

By focusing on these strategic components, companies can ensure that their sustainability efforts are not just well-intentioned but truly impactful. For more insights on promoting eco-conscious brands, explore [Keyhole's guide](https://keyhole.co/blog/sustainability-in-social-media-marketing/). And if crafting a comprehensive sustainability report is on your agenda, [Apiday](https://www.apiday.com/blog-posts/6-steps-to-write-a-comprehensive-sustainability-report) offers detailed steps for doing so.

The journey to sustainable business practices is indeed challenging, but with the right strategies and commitment, it's well within reach. By honing in on strategic sustainability practices, engaging with stakeholders, integrating science and technology, and leveraging visual and social media tools, companies can pave the way for a more sustainable and successful future.

I got a touch impress last week as I wanted a hassle-free(ish) way to make nicer espresso than my nespresso.   
And so far it's been ... horrible.  
I bought some beans from the local roaster and never managed to make a decent shot. (It was a taster pack of 100g beans each, and basically by the time the intelligent setup had finished, there were none left.)  
Then I bought some Illy classic beans from Amazon - I got some okish shots at grind size 22, but they were still very bitter and not really an upgrade from the nespresso capsules (and that's saying a lot.)   
Then the free bags from notes arrived - I tried the intelligent setup again and : Started at 22, no coffee came out. Recommended 29. Set to 29, way too fast. Back to 25: drip-drip-drip. Back to 27: way too fast. Back to 25: slow flow - not horrible. Tried again the next day on 25 (this time with the single basket as I really only ever drink single espressos): Way too fast. Back to 22. Slow, then drip-drip. Okish. Next day: No coffee on 22. Not a drop. Wet puck. 

That's where I am now - should I just send this thing back? All I wanted was an easy way to make nice espresso, clearly that's either not possible or I'm just too stupid for nice coffee.

I will be honest , I read about the whole Team Salman Team Asfar thing when the show was airing (I knew Sherry and Sajal then but never saw BAK back then ) also having never watched Sajal's show ever I skipped it, I retried watching it in 2024 but it was slowww so Again skipped it, I somehow then watched BAK shows from 2024 and came back to this only to again find it boring till ep 7 and then ended up Binge watching....Oh what a wonderful show this is.

This show in its core I feel celebrates Women, a mother, a Widow, A person who knows how to express, A woman loosing emotions because of career, a houseworker, A College new generation, A woman who knows what compromise means , A woman who becomes the bread winner and shoulders equal responsibilities and A woman who is obsessed with control because of her own traumas....

This show makes you think a lot of things...the parents when at a time only relied on what their parents said in terms of life or property and never having to think about getting it legalized and be stuck on it because it is your right while your siblings asking for their right because the current world scenario isnt that easy....I couldnt decide was Agha Ji right in his stubborness or Were the siblings correct...

Phuppo being the protagonist of Bridgette Jones's Diary , she is loud and trustworthy but is a runaway bride...But She also needs care...She was such a nice character...Overbearing with her Logic reasonings but she always spoke the truth...(I somehow ended up laughing looking at who her Safder Ji was  but yeah) .....

Thanvi Uncle is the Uncle who inspires kids to be cool but he needs a companion and what a loyalist he is....I wish Adil Uncle also came to spice things up but it was then focus on older love triangle more than younger lol.

Family equation was what pulled me in and Asfar made me stay..Salman annoyed me , Even Aliya annoyed me,,,like TALK IN NORMAL WORDS.....God both are frustrating and had Salman's Mom not be there in the equation Salman's taunts would end their relationship, Because they for everything that's there can make other understand everything well but only tease each other to the point of frustation...

Asfar on the other hand his styling annoyed me more than anything...I was so aligned with him questionning Aliya who is just a collegue's decision to LEGIT BARGE in his PERSONAL Space time and Again like who Does that??? Anyone would get incorrect ideas...But I dont think he was a good match for Aliya in the long term unless he saw the entire family dynamics in its core rather than at superficial level of sending positiive vibes.. Desi families love hate do Kalesh and stay together which in his life would need too much brain usage other than business dealings it would have ended up disappointing Aliya sooner or later. But if it was only Aliya Salman and Asfar...Asfar would win.....

The tension between the 3 in same screen was something which was not reaching its peak but was so Good. I mean My mind wis happy it ended as a happy slice of life but I also wonder if this was played out only letting the core Love angle being played out then would it be different from typical Love triangle dramas or would be something more better....

Also I dont think Aliya Loved Asfar ,,,Nope, Salman knew how to Pull her strings and soothe her inner demons related to her family (her family is her soul and Woman her nature need a Man more to become her strength than her Prince Charmings hence her to and fro because Salman kept on taunting her insted of trusting her ) which is what she subconsciously loved about him...

**Salman was her Comfort Coffee after a tiring day which kept on changing formulations and Asfar was the Alarm Clock which she needed to change batteries on order for him to work according to her expected expectation so she can Work better...**

Also the last Dance sequence and the ring scene made me smile and be in melancholy at the same time..Simply a WONDERFUL and Underrated in Popularity Show....

A little about me:

I‚Äôm a 27-year-old guy from the Netherlands, currently living in Arnhem (originally from Amsterdam). I‚Äôm tall‚Äî2.05m (6‚Äô8‚Äù)‚Äîand around 120kg. In my free time, I enjoy gaming, making music, and going out with friends. I never had a relationship, went on a date and dont have much luck tbh. So im looking for a relationship on reddit. I can be a bit quiet and really open up when i get to know you. 

What I‚Äôm looking for:

I‚Äôm hoping to meet a kind, down-to-earth woman who's interested in building a connection that could lead to something meaningful. I don‚Äôt have a strict ‚Äútype,‚Äù but I do appreciate someone who takes care of themselves and has a good sense of humor. Being open-minded and able to enjoy conversations is a big plus!

Ideally, I‚Äôd love to meet someone who‚Äôs also looking to explore a relationship at a natural pace‚Äîno pressure, just seeing where things go. Whether it's getting to know each other over coffee, sharing some laughs while gaming, or going for a walk, I value genuine connection above all.

I‚Äôm happy to travel up to 1.5 hours to meet someone, and distance isn‚Äôt a huge deal if we click.

If any of this resonates with you, feel free to send me a DM and tell me a bit about yourself. Looking forward to chatting and hopefully getting to know someone special.",1,1743938370.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I need to know I‚Äôm not the only one.**



**08/11**¬†



There were two places I had in mind for next time. The old fruit market, down by the Clyde, or the dilapidated building that used to be the ABC Cinema.¬†



The cinema stood out to me the most, but I was pretty sure that was because I had read strange articles about its closure. I had never gone inside, mind you, but something about it lingered in my mind. It would be cool to see what was left inside.



The old fruit market would have been fun too, though‚Äîit was where my Aunt used to sell her fruit and veg before she passed. I never got to visit her at work. Better late than never.



**09/11**



I ran into Michael down at the photography club. He said the old fruit market had been cordoned off due to a stabbing, so I guessed that was off the list.

The plan was to head to the ABC building the day after tomorrow.



**10/11**



I knew I had said two days but I just wanted to have a look around the outside‚Äî to see if there was any real way to get inside without someone calling the police.¬†



There seemed to be an unbarricaded entrance right at the front, the only thing I had to watch out for was other people.



If I went early enough, there wouldn't be anyone around. It was still winter, which meant it would be pitch black before 8am. I would head there for 7am just to be sure. The street was so deserted, it felt like another world‚Äî and that was just from the outside.



Just before I left I realised I had been watching the exterior of the building for longer than I thought. The sun had almost set and I could have sworn I had heard laughter coming from inside the cinema.¬†



Maybe someone else had the same idea, or maybe it was just the way sound carried in empty places. Either way, I thought I‚Äôd go for a pint before heading home.

  


**11/11**



**5AM.**



I had been worried that there would be early commuters who might‚Äôve seen me trying to get into the ABC. I thought I‚Äôd head down earlier since I was already awake.



**6AM.**



I stood outside, coffee in hand. There really was something otherworldly about this place‚Äî it was as if time had stood still. Old ‚Äò70s showings were still lettered on the marquee: *Grease* and *Jaws 2.* The cracks in the facade looked like they had always been there, while the vines and ivy desperately grasped at the broken windows. It felt more like a theatre than a cinema. A half-torn ‚ÄòClosed for Renovation‚Äô sign hung lopsided on the front doors, its letters bleached almost white by time.



My fears of being seen by commuters faded when I realised I‚Äôd been standing here for over 25 minutes and hadn‚Äôt seen a single person‚Äînot even a fox. I stepped closer to the entrance and caught a faint whiff of something sweet. Popcorn?¬†



Everything was in ruins but the marquee. It remained pristine, almost untarnished, as if the years hadn‚Äôt dared touch it. The ticket booth‚Äôs glass was shattered, old ticket stubs littered the ground, and deep cracks ran through the stonework, spidering up the walls like veins.¬†



The moment I stepped into the foyer, the outside world fell silent. Not gradually, like walking into an empty building, but all at once‚Äîlike a switch had been flipped. The air inside was thick, humid, almost oppressive‚Äîeven though it was a crisp 5¬∞C outside.



I took my time, carefully photographing every piece of history I could find, focusing on the things left behind‚Äîpieces of clothing, tills, machinery. It seemed as though people had left in a hurry. No company would abandon tills full of money unless there was a good reason for it. And why hadn‚Äôt the money been stolen after all these years?



I climbed the five steps leading deeper inside the cinema, inspecting the movie posters as I went. The ones that were behind glass had hardly aged a day in almost 20 years‚Äîmovies I‚Äôd never heard of, from times I‚Äôd never experienced.¬†



Thinking of this place bustling and full of life gave me a strange sense of loss.¬†



Why had they never completed the renovations, surely this was a listed building?

  


**7AM**¬†



I found one of those ‚ÄúYou Are Here‚Äù maps on the wall and used it as a guide, planning my route through the womb of the building and up into its heart‚Äîthe projection room. I had read somewhere years ago that it might still be operable, and wanted to take a look for myself.



As I traced my path and tried to commit it to memory, I thought I heard distant murmuring voices. Immediately, my mind went to the laughter I had heard yesterday while standing outside.¬†



It was entirely possible that people were living in this building, and it was just as possible that my ears were playing tricks on me.¬†



I hesitated for a moment, but I knew I would still go deeper inside.¬†



There was something else, though‚Äîsomething I couldn't put my finger on. It hung in the air, distant yet rancid, like the stench of a dying animal.



**7:30AM.**



I stepped through the shattered door leading further inside; the ivy crawled around the frame as if it were reclaiming it. I shone my torch ahead, catching a flicker of movement at the edge of the light. I adjusted the angle‚Äînothing. Just an empty waiting room, the old concession stand looming in the middle, swallowed by darkness.¬†



At the concession stand stood an old popcorn machine, its interior coated in a blackened substance. It was probably mould, but when the beam from my torch hit it, it looked alive‚Äîshiny and glistening, as if waiting for someone to touch it.¬†



The ‚ÄúYou Are Here‚Äù map had shown a clear path to the projection room, but as I moved deeper into the building, it felt like wandering through a forest at night‚Äîmy sense of direction fading, replaced by a growing sense of unease. The murmuring I thought I heard before was gone now, leaving only the silence ringing in my ears.¬†



**8AM.**



I cautiously stepped through the debris and broken glass, each crunch underfoot like tiny bombs exploding in the silence. I had documented the concession stand and then turned to visualise my route. I wanted to check out some of the cinema rooms before I headed upstairs. I swung my torch around, scanning the numbers on the cinema room doors. I chose one at random‚ÄîScreen 6‚Äîwalked toward it, pushed the door open, and stepped inside.



The walkway into the theatre was so dark it seemed to swallow my torchlight‚Äîso thick, I thought I could feel it brush against me. Without my torch, navigating this space would be impossible. I tried not to dwell on the fact that I had only brought one torch and a single set of batteries.¬†



I pushed open the double doors and was instantly struck by the overwhelming red. The walls, seats, carpets, and curtains‚Äîall red. As I scanned the room, I realized it was much larger than the building‚Äôs exterior had suggested. The walls loomed tall and fractured, and where ceiling lights once hung, only gaping black voids remained.



The ceiling itself, though cracked enough to expose the outside, let in little natural light‚Äîonly making the room feel even redder.



Amid the sea of seats, one stood out‚Äîa single chair pushed down, as if someone was sitting there.



I walked over to investigate, expecting to find a broken mechanism or rusted hinges keeping it down. Instead, I found a perfectly functional seat, undamaged by time. Not a single piece of debris rested on it. It looked sterile compared to everything around it.¬†



At first, I didn‚Äôt think much of it. A bit strange, maybe, how clean it was. Just a seat, nothing more.¬†



But the longer I stared at it, the more certain I became‚Äîsomeone was sitting there.¬†



I shifted on my feet, suddenly aware of how wild my thoughts had become and decided now would be a good time to head upstairs.¬†



My mouth was so dry it felt like I had eaten sand, I quickly shuffled my way out of the row of seats back onto the stepped aisle. While walking up the steps to the exit, a burning desire crept over me‚ÄîI needed to turn around.



I turned, almost expecting to see someone staring back at me. Instead I found everything exactly as it was. The strange seat still down, everything else still in its place.¬†



I shook my head, how had my thoughts become so fantastical? I winced at myself. How many years have you done urban exploration? The only scary thing here is my imagination.¬†



I hurriedly pushed the door open, which led directly back into the thick black walkway.¬†



As I took my first step into the abyss, I heard it.¬†

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mushroom coffee has gained popularity in recent years among health-conscious consumers looking for an alternative to traditional coffee. This beverage combines regular coffee with various fungi, most commonly reishi, lion‚Äôs mane, and chaga mushrooms. The result is a drink that not only wakes you up but also offers a range of health benefits. Let‚Äôs explore the benefits of mushroom coffee and why it may be a game-changer for those seeking a healthier brew.

One of the primary benefits of mushroom coffee is its potential to enhance mental clarity and focus. Lion's mane mushrooms, a popular ingredient, are known for their neuroprotective properties. They may help support cognitive function and improve memory. By incorporating lion‚Äôs mane into your coffee, you can enjoy a smoother, more alert morning without the jitters often associated with regular coffee consumption.

Another advantage is the reduced caffeine content. Many blends of mushroom coffee use a smaller amount of actual coffee beans, leading to a gentler boost of energy. This is ideal for individuals sensitive to caffeine. The combination of mushrooms and coffee can provide a balanced energy lift without the crashes that often follow a typical cup of coffee.

Additionally, mushroom coffee is rich in antioxidants. Ingredients like chaga mushrooms are packed with powerful antioxidants that help combat oxidative stress in the body. This may reduce inflammation and support overall health. By sipping on mushroom coffee, you're not just getting your caffeine fix; you're also getting a drink that supports your immune system and may contribute to better overall wellness.

The adaptogenic properties of many mushrooms used in these coffee blends add another layer of health benefits. Adaptogens are natural substances that help the body adapt to stress and promote balance. For example, reishi mushrooms are known to help with stress relief and may enhance overall mood. This addition can help you navigate the challenges of daily life with greater ease and a positive mindset.

- **Mental Clarity:** Enhances focus and cognitive function.
- **Lower Caffeine:** Provides energy without the jitters.
- **Antioxidant-Rich:** Supports immune health and reduces inflammation.
- **Adaptogenic Benefits:** Helps manage stress and improves mood.

For those starting their journey into the world of mushroom coffee, the taste might be an initial concern. Many brands have worked hard to create blends that are flavorful and palatable. The earthy undertones of the mushrooms can complement the rich flavors of coffee, resulting in a unique and enjoyable drinking experience. You might find that mushroom coffee introduces you to new flavor profiles that you wouldn't typically associate with your morning cup.

Mushroom coffee into your daily routine is easy. You can find various ready-to-drink options, instant mixes, or even ground mushrooms to add to your favorite coffee brand. Whether you prefer a fresh brew or something quick and easy, there's a mushroom coffee product tailored to your needs. This versatility makes it a convenient option for busy lifestyles.

Many consumers appreciate that mushroom coffee is often made from organic ingredients. This not only supports personal health but also aligns with a more sustainable approach to consumption. When you choose organic, you‚Äôre helping to promote environmentally friendly farming practices, leading to healthier soils and ecosystems.

Moreover, as mushroom coffee continues to grow in popularity, more research is emerging about the specific health benefits associated with various types of mushrooms. The potential for discovering new advantages makes this an exciting time for health enthusiasts. By exploring the benefits of mushroom coffee today, you could be part of a larger movement toward healthier beverage choices.

Many people who switch to mushroom coffee report feeling more balanced throughout the day. The combination of cognitive support, stress relief, and a gentle energy boost helps reduce the anxiety that sometimes accompanies traditional caffeine consumption. If you‚Äôre on a path toward healthier living or simply seeking to diversify your morning routine, mushroom coffee offers a compelling option worth trying.

This beverage isn‚Äôt just a trend; it's an innovative approach to enjoying coffee with extra perks. As you consider making the switch, remember that it‚Äôs about finding what works best for you and your lifestyle. With mushroom coffee, you might just discover a healthier brew that satisfies more than just your taste buds.

# Coffee Measurement Basics

Making the perfect cup of coffee starts with understanding coffee measurement basics. How many tablespoons of coffee per cup is a question many coffee lovers ask. Precise measurements can transform a regular cup into an extraordinary one. Let‚Äôs dive into the essentials of coffee measurements.

# Importance Of Accurate Measurements

Accurate measurements are crucial for a consistent and delicious cup of coffee. Using the right amount of coffee grounds ensures the flavor is balanced and not too weak or too strong.

Here are a few reasons why accurate measurements matter:

* **Consistency:** Precise measurements help achieve the same great taste every time.
* **Flavor Balance:** The right amount of coffee grounds balances the bitterness and acidity.
* **Cost Efficiency:** Proper measurements prevent wastage of coffee grounds.
* **Brewing Time:** Accurate measurements ensure the coffee brews at the optimal time.

For those who love to experiment, accurate measurements allow for better control over the brewing process. This can lead to discovering new flavors and preferences.

# Common Measurement Units

Several common units are used to measure coffee. Understanding these units helps in achieving the perfect brew.

The most common units include:

1. **Tablespoons:** A simple and widely used method. One tablespoon of coffee is roughly 5-7 grams.
2. **Grams:** Preferred by professionals. It provides precise measurement.
3. **Cups:** Often used in recipes. One cup of coffee is typically 6-8 ounces.
4. **Scoops:** Coffee scoops are designed for convenience. One scoop usually equals two tablespoons.

Here‚Äôs a handy table to understand the conversions:

UnitEquivalent1 Tablespoon5-7 grams1 Scoop2 Tablespoons1 Cup6-8 ounces

Using these units, you can easily adjust the amount of coffee to your taste. It‚Äôs all about finding the right balance for your perfect cup.

# Standard Coffee Ratios

Many people ask, ‚ÄúHow many tablespoons of coffee per cup?‚Äù The answer can vary, but knowing the standard coffee ratios can help. These ratios ensure your coffee tastes just right every time. Let‚Äôs explore the best coffee-to-water measurements for a perfect brew.

# General Guidelines

The standard coffee ratio is simple. It‚Äôs often recommended to use one to two tablespoons of ground coffee for every six ounces of water. This ratio suits most tastes and brew methods. Here‚Äôs a quick guide:

* **Light Coffee:** Use one tablespoon of coffee per six ounces of water.
* **Medium Coffee:** Use one and a half tablespoons of coffee per six ounces of water.
* **Strong Coffee:** Use two tablespoons of coffee per six ounces of water.

For easy reference, here‚Äôs a table showing different ratios:

Water (oz)Light Coffee (tbsp)Medium Coffee (tbsp)Strong Coffee (tbsp)611.52122341834.56

Using these ratios ensures a balanced cup of coffee. Adjust according to your preference for light, medium, or strong coffee.

# Factors Affecting Ratios

Several factors can affect your coffee ratios. Understanding these helps you tweak your brew for the best taste. Here are some key factors:

1. **Coffee Grind Size:** The grind size influences extraction. Finer grinds extract faster and can taste stronger. Coarser grinds take longer and may need more coffee to achieve the desired strength.
2. **Brewing Method:** Different methods require different ratios. For example, French press coffee might need a coarser grind and more coffee. Espresso, on the other hand, uses a finer grind and a higher coffee-to-water ratio.
3. **Water Quality:** The taste of your water affects your coffee. Use filtered water for the best results. Hard or soft water can change the flavor.
4. **Personal Preference:** Everyone‚Äôs taste is different. Some like their coffee strong, others prefer it lighter. Adjust the ratios to suit your taste.

Here‚Äôs a quick table summarizing these factors:

FactorImpact on RatioGrind SizeFiner grinds need less coffee, coarser grinds need more.Brewing MethodMethods like French press need more coffee, espresso needs less.Water QualityFiltered water gives a better taste.Personal PreferenceAdjust based on your taste preference.

By considering these factors, you can find the perfect coffee ratio for your taste. Enjoy your perfect cup of coffee!

# Types Of Coffee Grinds

When brewing coffee, the grind size plays a crucial role in determining the flavor and strength of your cup. The number of tablespoons of coffee per cup depends significantly on the type of coffee grind used. Understanding the different types of coffee grinds and their impact on your drink can help you brew the perfect cup every time.

I flew to visit one of the engineers and then decided to return to I Sola Prospect. I had never used these ""space buses"" before, but today I decided to relax and take a break from the helm.

I ordered a shuttle, sat next to a female pilot who greeted me warmly, and we began our ascent. That's when I realized ‚Äì this is something I've been missing in this game. I really want a co-pilot.

I could hire one of those guys with strange names loafing around by the hundreds and thousands at every station, hand them the controls, and finally go try out the coffee maker on my Krait.

But let‚Äôs be honest. 99% of them will never get invited to join a crew ‚Äì no one wants to sit next to a freak. It must make them sad and upset. But that's life.

But I digress. We were leaving the spaceport when some trader appeared ahead. He was slowly dragging his star-dust-covered rear end towards landing, carrying another batch of biological waste or something equally meaningless in his hold.

My space taxi driver confidently set a course straight for him, then accelerated and rammed into that poor trader. We instantly lost our shields and a third of our hull integrity. But the taxi driver didn‚Äôt even flinch and showed no reaction to what happened.

My journey to I Sola Prospect involved transfers ‚Äì shuttles don‚Äôt fly long distances for some reason. When I arrived at an intermediate station, I went to the manager intending to complain about my driver's behavior. However, he wouldn‚Äôt accept any objections and only provided me with the next shuttle.

I resigned myself and boarded it. To my surprise, I saw my taxi driver again in the cockpit. She pretended not to recognize me. Calmly greeting me, we started ascending.

This time, our departure from the station went smoothly. We safely reached the system where I had another transfer planned. My cosmic driver aimed at the station, and that‚Äôs when I noticed that the station was located behind the asteroid belt of the local gas giant.

I tried to warn her, but she didn‚Äôt respond. At full speed, we crashed into the asteroids ‚Äì fortunately, the automatic systems saved us. But once again, the space taxi driver acted as if nothing had happened and soon started charging the hyperdrive ‚Äì aiming directly at the asteroids hiding the station.

Strangely enough, this time by some miracle, we passed through the asteroid belt unscathed. After docking, I decided that was enough for me. I called my ship, waited half an hour, and flew to I Sola Prospect on my own.

P.S. I still haven't managed to drink tea from the mug bolted inside the shuttle to my left. For that, I would‚Äôve needed three-meter-long arms.

*   **Automatic Shut-Off and Boil-Dry Protection:** These safety features prevent overheating and‚Äå potential damage, making it safer than stovetop alternatives. This is exceptionally important for minimizing risk within a commercial setting, allowing staff to focus ‚Å¢on other critical ‚Äçtasks.

## Performance Under Pressure: Is it a True Commercial Electric Kettle?

While the Hamilton Beach 40869 offers‚Äå attractive specs, the real test lies in its‚Å¢ performance in commercial environments. Does it hold up to the demands of constant use in a restaurant ‚Äåkettle scenario?

**Boiling Speed:** The 1500-watt heating element certainly contributes to rapid boiling. In our tests, a full 1.7 liters boiled in under 7 minutes. This is a considerable advantage, especially for cafes or businesses needing to quickly serve hot beverages ‚Äåor prepare ingredients. Compared to a standard stovetop kettle, this offers dramatic‚Äã time savings.**Durability and Build ‚ÄãQuality:**‚Å£ The glass construction raises some questions about durability. While visually appealing, glass is inherently more fragile than ‚Äåstainless steel. However, the 40869 ‚Å¢features a reinforced glass body designed to withstand normal use. Furthermore, the stainless steel components add to the overall‚Å£ robustness. User reviews‚Å¢ suggest the kettle ‚Äãcan hold‚Äå up ‚Å¢to moderate commercial usage, though it might not be the ideal choice for the ‚Äåabsolute most demanding restaurant kettle environment, where a heavy-duty electric kettle might be more appropriate.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance:** The cordless design and 360-degree base simplify filling and pouring, ‚Äçcrucial‚Å£ for busy staff. The wide‚Äã mouth makes cleaning relatively straightforward, especially ‚Äçwith‚Äã the removable anti-scale filter. However, mineral buildup is unavoidable,‚Å§ particularly in areas with hard‚Äç water, so regular descaling is essential. The availability of ‚Äå40869 replacement parts reduces the impact from minor damages.

**electricity Rating ‚Å¢Analysis:** it's imperative to understand the electricity ‚Äçrating of the Hamilton ‚Å£Beach 40869 and ‚Å£confirm its compatibility with your commercial kitchen equipment setup. The‚Å£ kettle operates on standard‚Å¢ US voltage (120V) and draws approximately‚Å¢ 12.5 amps‚Å¢ (1500‚Äã watts / 120 volts =‚Äã 12.5 amps). Ensure your electrical‚Å§ circuits can handle this load, particularly if you plan to‚Å§ use multiple kettles simultaneously. Overloading circuits can lead to safety hazards and equipment ‚Å£damage. Consulting with a qualified ‚Å£electrician ‚Å§is always recommended for‚Äå commercial installations.

## LSI Deep dive: Tailoring the 40869 to specific Commercial Needs

The ""Hamilton Beach 1.7L Illuminated Glass Kettle - 40869‚Äã electricity rating"" isn't just a model number; it represents a purchasing‚Å¢ decision with ‚Å§distinct considerations for different audience segments.Let's examine some LSI keywords and tailor ‚Å§insights to specific‚Äå users:

*   **Restaurant Owners & Cafe Owners:** For these users,speed,durability,and ease‚Äç of ‚Å§cleaning are paramount. the 40869 offers decent speed and relatively easy maintenance. however, for extremely high-volume operations, consider whether a‚Äå dedicated commercial kitchen equipment kettle designed for constant use might be a better investment. It is indeed a good consideration as a restaurant kettle when looking at lower initial costs and a more budget-amiable option.
*   ‚Å£**Hotel Managers:** Hotels need reliable and aesthetically pleasing kettles for guest rooms or breakfast ‚Å£bars. The illuminated glass and sleek design of the 40869 make it suitable for hotel settings. The automatic shut-off feature is a meaningful safety benefit. Property managers of furnished rentals and Airbnbs can also benefit from this feature,‚Å£ offering guests both convenience and security.
*   **Office Managers:** For office settings, ‚Äãthe 40869 provides a convenient‚Äå and safe way for employees to make tea or‚Äç coffee. Its BPA free electric kettle construction ensures water purity.
*   **Catering Companies:** Catering companies require portable‚Äç and reliable equipment. While the 40869 is relatively lightweight, it ‚Äãmight not be the most ‚Äårugged option for frequent transport. Consider‚Å¢ the conditions‚Å£ it‚Å£ will be exposed to during‚Å¢ setup and teardown.
*   **Bulk Buyers:** ‚Å£Businesses looking to purchase multiple kettles should explore volume discounts and‚Äå warranty options. In this case, purchasing multiple units of the ‚Å¢40869 may be less expensive than purchasing one unit of a much higher-priced restaurant kettle.

## Comparing the Hamilton ‚Å¢Beach 40869 to Alternatives: Stainless Steel vs. Glass and Beyond

The electric kettle market offers diverse options. How does the Hamilton Beach 40869 stack up against stainless steel ‚Å¢kettles and other alternatives?

**Glass vs. Stainless Steel:** Stainless steel kettles are generally more durable and resistant ‚Å§to dents and ‚Äådamage. However, glass kettles offer the advantage‚Äå of visibility, allowing you to see the water level and any mineral buildup. Glass is also considered‚Å§ by some to be more hygienic as it does not impart any flavors to the water.

**Other Considerations:** features like temperature control, keep-warm functions, and specialized tea infusers are available in some electric kettles. The hamilton Beach 40869 offers basic functionality but lacks these advanced features. If ‚Å§precise temperature control is essential for brewing specific types of tea or coffee,‚Å§ consider models with‚Äç adjustable‚Å§ temperature settings.Weigh the pros and cons carefully based on‚Å£ your specific needs and budget. A ‚Å¢stainless steel kettle,though potentially less visually‚Äç appealing,might‚Å¢ be a wiser long-term investment for high-demand environments.

Ever feel like there aren't enough hours in the day? I was there too, buried under to-do lists and feeling like I was running on a hamster wheel. üêπ One day, while trying to squeeze in a bit of ""me"" time between back-to-back Zoom calls and erratic snack breaks, I stumbled upon an idea that changed *everything*‚Äîa little dance between daily rituals and time blocking. And guess what? I managed to snatch back around 10 hours a week. üéâ

**Here‚Äôs my secret sauce, served with a side of ""real life"" ketchup:**

**1. Don‚Äôt Let Perfectionism Crash Your Party**  
I used to equate productivity with perfection: my rituals had to be flawless, and my time blocks immovable. Spoiler alert: that's exhausting. üòÖ Now, I aim for *progress,* not perfection. I start small, like making my bed in the morning. A tiny win primes me for bigger achievements. Ever notice how a made bed makes your room look 60% cleaner too? Just me?

**2. Define Your Daily Rituals**  
These are those non-negotiables that keep you sane. For me, it's the simple things:  
- **Morning coffee meditation** ‚òïÔ∏è (aka staring into the abyss of my mug)  
- **15-minute daily walk** üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (rain or shine, there's something about fresh air)  
- Ending the day with a non-screen-related activity (reading, journaling, drawing silly doodles - anything counts!)  

**3. Harness the Magic of Time Blocking**  
If daily rituals are the comfy slippers, time blocks are the crisp work shoes. They structure your day but leave room for flexing. Here‚Äôs my go-to:  
- **Work Sprints:** 50-minute bursts of focus, 10-minute breaks. It‚Äôs like HIIT for my brain. üß†üí™  
- **Themed Days:** Ever try ""Meeting Monday"" or ""Tech-Free Tuesday""? Game changer!  
- **Buffer Blocks:** Because life happens‚Äîemails, chats, and unexpected snacking disasters.  

**4. Combine Forces: Rituals Meet Blocks**  
I noticed blending them made each day feel like a well-edited playlist instead of a broken record. My morning ritual flows into the first work block, and by the time post-lunch slump hits, I'm ready for another mini-ritual that resets my focus. üé∂

**5. Start Small, Celebrate Big**  
Shout-out to anyone who can feel overwhelmed by grand designs (hi, anxiety monsters üëã). Starting small‚Äîlike an extra glass of water a day‚Äîbuilds up the momentum. Kind of like leveling up in a video game. Did you know? Celebrating those small wins boosts motivation like nothing else!

And honestly, that's it. It's not about cramming more into your day; it's about weaving your time with intention. It's kinda like braiding hair‚Äîonce you get the rhythm, it all falls into place.

So, what are your rituals or time hacks? Ever tried mixing and matching them? Let's keep the convo going‚Äîbecause we're all in this unglamorous but rewarding hustle together. üöÄ",1,1743935119.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

My mantra? ‚ÄúMoney makes the world go ‚Äòround‚Äù‚Äîand I was running on a hamster wheel trying to make sure I was on the right side of that equation. I thought if I could just hustle a little harder, invest a little smarter, and ‚Äúkeep up‚Äù with everyone else, I‚Äôd finally feel like I was on solid ground.

Spoiler alert: I was wrong.

It wasn‚Äôt until I stumbled upon Stoicism‚Äîof all things‚Äîthat I started seeing money and wealth in a whole new light. Let me back up for a sec, because I promise this isn‚Äôt another ‚Äúquit your job, meditate for a year, and get rich‚Äù post.

I started with the basics of Stoicism: controlling what you can control. Seems simple enough, right? But when it comes to money, the first thing I had to realize was that I couldn‚Äôt control everything. I couldn‚Äôt control the economy, the whims of investors on Reddit, or the constant flood of ads telling me what I needed to buy to be happy.

Instead, I could control my own spending, my investment choices, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîmy mindset.

That‚Äôs when things started to shift.

I‚Äôm not saying I became a minimalist overnight (trust me, I still enjoy my morning coffee from a fancy mug), but I started to ask myself some uncomfortable questions: Why am I buying this? Is this actually making me happy, or am I just trying to fill some void? Am I investing in my future, or am I just trying to look good for my friends?

One of the Stoic teachings that really hit me was this quote from Epictetus: ‚ÄúWealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.‚Äù That was a wake-up call. I was drowning in stuff I didn‚Äôt need, constantly filling my life with things that I thought would bring me happiness. The truth? It was all fleeting. And the more I accumulated, the more I felt... empty.

Here‚Äôs where the humor comes in‚Äîbecause, of course, I had to laugh at myself. There I was, sitting on the couch, scrolling through Instagram, seeing all these people posting their ‚Äúdream lives.‚Äù Meanwhile, I was over here stressing about whether I could afford a new tech gadget that definitely wouldn‚Äôt make my life better. Just like everyone else on the internet, I was playing the game of ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Got the Best Life?‚Äù and I was losing.

The Stoics weren‚Äôt about that. They didn‚Äôt chase status. They didn‚Äôt care about what people thought. And that‚Äôs when I realized: I didn‚Äôt need more money to be financially independent. I needed less stuff. Less clutter. Less chaos in my mind.

So, I made some changes. I started by reviewing my spending habits. I didn‚Äôt do anything drastic at first‚Äîno fire sales of my belongings or anything (although I did sell a few things on eBay for some extra cash). The goal wasn‚Äôt to cut things out; it was to evaluate what really brought value to my life. Could I live with less and still be happy? The answer was yes.

I set up automatic savings transfers, and honestly, that was one of the most Stoic things I did. Why? Because it removed the emotional aspect. I didn‚Äôt have to think about it every month; it was already done for me. That felt like real freedom.

Then came the investing piece. I read about the Stoic concept of detachment‚Äînot getting emotionally swept up in the chaos of market fluctuations. If the stock market was down, I didn‚Äôt panic. If it was up, I didn‚Äôt get cocky. I learned to be patient and disciplined, which in Stoic terms means ‚Äúliving in accordance with nature.‚Äù The market will go up. The market will go down. But my goal? Long-term growth, not short-term gains.

That was the real shift for me. It wasn‚Äôt about accumulating wealth for the sake of status or security. It was about developing the mental discipline to consistently make good decisions and trust the process.

The most profound lesson I took away from Stoicism in all of this? True financial independence isn‚Äôt about how much money you make. It‚Äôs about how little you need to feel free. It‚Äôs about having control over your desires so that money is just a tool, not the driving force behind your happiness.

Now, I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm the Dalai Lama of finance or anything. I still enjoy splurging on things occasionally, and I‚Äôm not above treating myself. But the difference now is that I‚Äôm not doing it out of a sense of ‚Äúmissing out‚Äù or trying to keep up with everyone else. I do it because I want to, not because I feel like I need to.

In the end, Stoicism didn‚Äôt make me rich (at least, not in the way I thought). But it did give me something far more valuable: peace of mind. And if that‚Äôs the kind of financial independence you're after, I highly recommend giving this ancient philosophy a try. Who knows? It might just save you from buying that new iPhone next time.

If this resonated with you, I dive even deeper into Stoicism, personal finance, and living a purposeful life over on my YouTube channel. Feel free to check out my profile for the link, where I share more practical tips and insights on how to apply Stoic principles to financial independence and productivity.

¬†
There were two places I had in mind for next time. The old fruit market, down by the Clyde, or the dilapidated building that used to be the ABC Cinema.¬†

The cinema stood out to me the most, but I was pretty sure that was because I had read strange articles about its closure. I had never gone inside, mind you, but something about it lingered in my mind. It would be cool to see what was left inside.

The old fruit market would have been fun too, though‚Äîit was where my Aunt used to sell her fruit and veg before she passed. I never got to visit her at work. Better late than never.

09/11/90

I ran into Michael down at the photography club. He said the old fruit market had been cordoned off due to a stabbing, so I guessed that was off the list.
The plan was to head to the ABC building the day after tomorrow.

10/11/90

I knew I had said two days but I just wanted to have a look around the outside‚Äî to see if there was any real way to get inside without someone calling the police.¬†

There seemed to be an unbarricaded entrance right at the front, the only thing I had to watch out for was other people.

If I went early enough, there wouldn't be anyone around. It was still winter, which meant it would be pitch black before 8am. I would head there for 7am just to be sure. The street was so deserted, it felt like another world‚Äî and that was just from the outside.

Just before I left I realised I had been watching the exterior of the building for longer than I thought. The sun had almost set and I could have sworn I had heard laughter coming from inside the cinema.¬†

Maybe someone else had the same idea, or maybe it was just the way sound carried in empty places. Either way, I thought I‚Äôd go for a pint before heading home.

11/11/90

5AM.

I had been worried that there would be early commuters who might‚Äôve seen me trying to get into the ABC. I thought I‚Äôd head down earlier since I was already awake.

6AM.

I stood outside, coffee in hand. There really was something otherworldly about this place‚Äî it was like time had stood still. Old ‚Äò70s showings were still lettered on the marquee: Grease and Jaws 2. The cracks in the facade looked like they had always been there, while the vines and ivy desperately grasped at the broken windows. It felt more like a theatre than a cinema. A half-torn ‚ÄòClosed for Renovation‚Äô sign hung lopsided on the front doors, its letters bleached almost white by time.

My fears of being seen by commuters faded when I realised I‚Äôd been standing here for over 25 minutes and hadn‚Äôt seen a single person‚Äînot even a fox. I stepped closer to the entrance and caught a faint whiff of something sweet. Popcorn?¬†

Everything was in ruins but the marquee. It remained pristine, almost untarnished, as if the years hadn‚Äôt dared touch it. The ticket booth‚Äôs glass was shattered, old ticket stubs littered the ground, and deep cracks ran through the stonework.

The moment I stepped into the foyer, the outside world fell silent. Not gradually, like walking into an empty building, but all at once‚Äîlike a switch had been flipped. The air inside was thick, humid, almost oppressive‚Äîeven though it was a crisp 5¬∞C outside.

I took my time, carefully photographing every piece of history I could find, focusing on the things left behind‚Äîpieces of clothing, tills, machinery. 

It seemed as though people had left in a hurry. No company would abandon tills full of money unless there was a good reason for it. And why hadn‚Äôt the money been stolen after all these years?

I climbed the five steps leading deeper inside the cinema, inspecting the movie posters as I went. The ones that were behind glass had hardly aged a day in almost 20 years‚Äîmovies I‚Äôd never heard of, from times I‚Äôd never experienced.¬†

Thinking of this place bustling and full of life gave me a strange sense of loss.¬†

Why had they never completed the renovations, surely this was a listed building?

7AM¬†

I found one of those ‚ÄúYou Are Here‚Äù maps on the wall and used it as a guide, planning my route through the womb of the building and up into its heart‚Äîthe projection room. I had read somewhere years ago that it might still be operable, and wanted to take a look for myself.

As I traced my path and tried to commit it to memory, I thought I heard distant murmuring voices. Immediately, my mind went to the laughter I had heard yesterday while standing outside.¬†

It was entirely possible that people were living in this building, and it was just as possible that my ears were playing tricks on me.¬†

I hesitated for a moment, but I knew I would still go inside.¬†

There was something else, though‚Äîsomething I couldn't put my finger on. It hung in the air, distant yet rancid, like the stench of a dying animal.

PART 2 

7:30AM

I stepped through the shattered door leading further inside; the ivy crawled around the frame as if it were reclaiming it. I shone my torch ahead, catching a flicker of movement at the edge of the light. I adjusted the angle‚Äînothing. Just an empty waiting room, the old concession stand looming in the middle, swallowed by darkness.¬†

At the concession stand stood an old popcorn machine, its interior coated in a blackened substance. It was probably mould, but when the beam from my torch hit it, it looked alive‚Äîshiny and glistening, as if waiting for someone to touch it.¬†

The ‚ÄúYou Are Here‚Äù map had shown a clear path to the projection room, but as I moved deeper into the building, it felt like wandering through a forest at night‚Äîmy sense of direction fading, replaced by a growing sense of unease. The murmuring I thought I heard before was gone now, leaving only the silence ringing in my ears.
¬†
I cautiously stepped through the debris and broken glass, each crunch underfoot like tiny bombs exploding in the silence. I had documented the concession stand and then turned to visualise my route. I wanted to check out some of the cinema rooms before I headed upstairs. I swung my torch around, carefully scanning the numbers on the cinema room doors. I chose one at random‚ÄîScreen 6‚Äîwalked toward it, pushed the door open, and stepped inside.

8AM

The walkway into the theatre was so dark it felt like I could reach out, grab a handful, and slip it into my pocket. Without my torch, navigating this space would be impossible. I tried not to dwell on the fact that I had only brought one torch and a single set of batteries.¬†

I pushed open the double doors and was instantly struck by the overwhelming red. The walls, seats, carpets, and curtains‚Äîall red. As I scanned the room, I realized it was much larger than the exterior of the building had suggested. The walls loomed tall and cracked, and where ceiling lights once hung, only gaping black voids remained.

Amid the sea of seats, one stood out‚Äîa single chair pushed down, as if someone was sitting there.

I walked over to investigate, expecting to find a broken mechanism or rusted hinges keeping it down. Instead, I found a perfectly functional seat, undamaged by time. Not a single piece of debris rested on it. It looked sterile compared to everything around it.
¬†
At first, I didn‚Äôt think much of it. A bit strange, maybe, how clean it was. Just a seat, nothing more.¬†

But the longer I stared at it, the more certain I became‚Äîsomeone was sitting there.¬†

I shifted on my feet, suddenly aware of how wild my thoughts had become and decided now would be a good time to head upstairs.
¬†
My mouth was so dry it felt like I had eaten sand, I quickly shuffled my way out of the row of seats back onto the stepped aisle. While walking up the steps to the exit, A burning desire crept over me‚ÄîI needed to turn around.

I turned, almost expecting to see someone staring back at me. Instead I found everything exactly as it was. The strange seat still down, everything else still in its place.¬†

I shook my head, how had my thoughts become so fantastical? I winced at myself. How many years had I done urban exploration? The only scary thing here is my imagination.
¬†
I hurriedly pushed the door open, which led directly back into the thick black walkway.¬†

As I took my first step into the abyss, I heard it.¬†

The familiar sound of a cinema seat, returning to its normal upright position.¬†",1,1743934996.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

1jsr14t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1jsr14t/how_stoicism_taught_me_to_become_financially/,How Stoicism Taught Me to Become Financially Independent (Without Chasing Money),"I used to be the typical ‚Äúmoney-chaser.‚Äù You know, the kind who checks the stock market app more than I checked my own emotions. My mantra? ‚ÄúMoney makes the world go ‚Äòround‚Äù‚Äîand I was running on a hamster wheel trying to make sure I was on the right side of that equation. I thought if I could just hustle a little harder, invest a little smarter, and ‚Äúkeep up‚Äù with everyone else, I‚Äôd finally feel like I was on solid ground.

Spoiler alert: I was wrong.

It wasn‚Äôt until I stumbled upon Stoicism‚Äîof all things‚Äîthat I started seeing money and wealth in a whole new light. Let me back up for a sec, because I promise this isn‚Äôt another ‚Äúquit your job, meditate for a year, and get rich‚Äù post.

I started with the basics of Stoicism: controlling what you can control. Seems simple enough, right? But when it comes to money, the first thing I had to realize was that I *couldn‚Äôt* control everything. I couldn‚Äôt control the economy, the whims of investors on Reddit, or the constant flood of ads telling me what I *needed* to buy to be happy.

Instead, I could control my own spending, my investment choices, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîmy mindset.

That‚Äôs when things started to shift.

I‚Äôm not saying I became a minimalist overnight (trust me, I still enjoy my morning coffee from a fancy mug), but I started to ask myself some uncomfortable questions: *Why am I buying this?* *Is this actually making me happy, or am I just trying to fill some void?* *Am I investing in my future, or am I just trying to look good for my friends?*

One of the Stoic teachings that really hit me was this quote from Epictetus: *‚ÄúWealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.‚Äù* That was a wake-up call. I was drowning in stuff I didn‚Äôt need, constantly filling my life with things that I thought would bring me happiness. The truth? It was all fleeting. And the more I accumulated, the more I felt... empty.

Here‚Äôs where the humor comes in‚Äîbecause, of course, I had to laugh at myself. There I was, sitting on the couch, scrolling through Instagram, seeing all these people posting their ‚Äúdream lives.‚Äù Meanwhile, I was over here stressing about whether I could afford a new tech gadget that *definitely* wouldn‚Äôt make my life better. Just like everyone else on the internet, I was playing the game of ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Got the Best Life?‚Äù and I was losing.

The Stoics weren‚Äôt about that. They didn‚Äôt chase status. They didn‚Äôt care about what people thought. And that‚Äôs when I realized: I didn‚Äôt need more money to be financially independent. I needed less *stuff.* Less clutter. Less chaos in my mind.

So, I made some changes. I started by reviewing my spending habits. I didn‚Äôt do anything drastic at first‚Äîno fire sales of my belongings or anything (although I did sell a few things on eBay for some extra cash). The goal wasn‚Äôt to *cut* things out; it was to evaluate what really brought value to my life. Could I live with less and still be happy? The answer was yes.

I set up automatic savings transfers, and honestly, that was one of the most Stoic things I did. Why? Because it removed the emotional aspect. I didn‚Äôt have to think about it every month; it was already done for me. That felt like *real* freedom.

Then came the investing piece. I read about the Stoic concept of detachment‚Äî*not* getting emotionally swept up in the chaos of market fluctuations. If the stock market was down, I didn‚Äôt panic. If it was up, I didn‚Äôt get cocky. I learned to be patient and disciplined, which in Stoic terms means ‚Äúliving in accordance with nature.‚Äù The market will go up. The market will go down. But my goal? Long-term growth, not short-term gains.

That was the real shift for me. It wasn‚Äôt about accumulating wealth for the sake of status or security. It was about developing the mental discipline to consistently make good decisions and trust the process.

The most profound lesson I took away from Stoicism in all of this? True financial independence isn‚Äôt about how much money you make. It‚Äôs about how little you *need* to feel free. It‚Äôs about having control over your desires so that money is just a tool, not the driving force behind your happiness.

Now, I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm the Dalai Lama of finance or anything. I still enjoy splurging on things occasionally, and I‚Äôm not above treating myself. But the difference now is that I‚Äôm not doing it out of a sense of ‚Äúmissing out‚Äù or trying to keep up with everyone else. I do it because I *want* to, not because I feel like I *need* to.

In the end, Stoicism didn‚Äôt make me rich (at least, not in the way I thought). But it did give me something far more valuable: peace of mind. And if that‚Äôs the kind of financial independence you're after, I highly recommend giving this ancient philosophy a try. Who knows? It might just save you from buying that new iPhone next time.
