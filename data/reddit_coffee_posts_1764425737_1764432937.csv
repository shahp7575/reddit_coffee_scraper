There's a description of each bean option on the wall and the drinks are all very focused on the brew itself. 

I got a ""coferment,"" which is a specialty coffee created by adding fruit to the beans while fermenting. I've never had it before, but I absolutely love it! It has a flavor of wild strawberries alongside the espresso flavor.

In the past year i've become a very un-materialistic-  I don't like to ask for things and know a lot of items I'll never use more than once. I prefer to save up for bigger items like a nice coffee machine or some cozy bedding (especially since I plan on moving into my own place soon). Even then, I often times just want to buy things on my own.
I tried to tell my parents that I just want some money for Christmas; there's nothing specific I want and I'd rather just have some money to put to good use. They continued to urge me to put something on my list because it's more personal to buy an item than send money over. I get it, but there was nothing I wanted at the time.
Last week, I bought my partner a bass guitar. He's an extremely talented musician but had to leave his guitar at home when he moved in with my brother and I (needed space from my parents, they were very emotionally abusive but that's not important to the post). I've been scrapping by with my rent and minimum wage but I got him a nice $500 guitar he helped to pick out. He wont receive it until Christmas but I cant wait to hear him play.
This got me thinking- I've wanted to get into music for a long time. I'm not nearly as talented as he is BUT I do love playing the keys. And I've never owned my own keyboard, so it was worth a shot. I told my mother I would like a keyboard for christmas and we got to talking.
The issue is she is addicted to Amazon and its cheap deals. I asked her for a price range and while I waited for a response I started looking at some nice keys with my partner. We found a really lovely one with a drum pad as well and some software it came with which was on sale for $170. I thought this was a fine price but then my mom responded saying it had to be less than $100. I was disheartened but sent the link anyways, trying to explain to her why it was worth the price. She never responded and so I dropped the discussion and assumed she went to talk to my dad.
An amazon package came in last night and opening it up I realized it was my Christmas gift. It was some cheap knock-off keyboard she had found for way cheaper. It made me a bit upset. It's not the price that I'm worried about. If I could get a nice keyboard for the $30 she spent I totally would- and I'm also a sucker for a good deal. The issue is that I'm worried for that price the quality will be abysmal. I told her if the one I had picked out was too expensive we could settle on a different one, but I really wish she would have at least told me she was going to get the cheaper one. I'm tempted to send it back for a refund and send her the remaining money for the nicer one, that way it's still a gift from her.
I really don't want to sound like a rich asshole but I'm aware I come from a privileged background to even receive any gifts. It also kind of pisses me off because she constantly tries to spend as little money as possible on her children and then buys luxury brands and vacations for herself. If I sound like too much of a dick I'll totally just keep the keyboard and try it out. I'm sure it's fine and I won't end up hating it, I just wish she would have told me that she was going to try and get me something inexpensive. Please don't be too harsh in the comments because I'm genuinely trying to not be an asshole and if I am then just tell me instead of tearing me a new one over it",1,1764432696.0,amiwrong,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I usually turn them down, because brewing hot coffee hours before you plan to serve is just bad  and could tarnish my brand.

But it is frustrating to have to turn regularly say ""no,"" so I have been thinking a lot about how I can leverage the flavor stability of cold brew, to serve it hot. I have experimented a lot with ratios and heating methods and finally struck on a method of achieving large quantity brewing with acceptable flavor stability, using a cold brew concentrate diluted to strength, heated with a sous vide immersion stick.

Recipe:

Cold brew coffee brewed at a 9:1 ratio brewed in a filtron commercial brewer

Dilute 3 parts cold brew with 2 parts water

Heat to 160 degrees

I bought a relatively cheap sous vide wand for proof of principle, so it is only 800 watts. I was heating a full Cambro drink dispenser worth of coffee. At 800 watts and 4.75 gallons of coffee, it took almost 2 hrs to heat to 160 degrees. I set cook time to 5 minutes to ensure the container also reached that temperature.

This worked remarkably well and we were serving hot coffee six hours later and still getting compliments on the flavor.

I'm fairly certain that no one in my town makes six figures (but TBF most are either ex military pensioners or blue collar workers) - and the city I work in is obviously a mix. 

Whilst I hear people complaining about the economy and the general state politics - consumer behavior doesn't seem to have changed much. The line for Starbucks every morning is always much longer than the line for cheaper alternatives like Dunkin or McDonalds Coffee. There are many articles coming out now that Black Friday online sales have broken records. At my supermarket - Turkey's, which are not cheap by any means, were sold out. There are many other personal anecdotes I can think of that demonstrate that many middle class Americans still seem to have fair amounts of disposable income that they are more than willing to deploy. 

All of this doesn't seem to suggest that the 1% is powering the economy through mass purchases all by themselves - while the rest of us starve or hold on to our dollars.

My girlfriend and I are living abroad. 

This year, her sister decided to live abroad also, and decided to come to the country we are living.
She was unemployed back at home, and as a job opportunity came along, she decided to come to the country we are living in.

The thing is: she came without any money, her parents are the ones who sustained her at home, so naturally they gave her some money to come. 
My girlfriend payed her tickets for airplane, and at the airport the sister spent right away 160€ in cigarettes.

The whole month living at our house, never payed for groceries. I had to change our coffee brand at home for a cheaper one, because she was at the house all day, and as me and my girlfriend took one cup of coffee a day, she was drinking 4/5 coffees. And of course, never bought coffee. The same with personal products like shower gel, toothpaste etc. 

Also, she is one of those people who always says she can do everything, but is always late for everything: only wants to vacuum when someone is holding the vacuum cleaner, never did laundry and never helped with hanging clothes unless she was asked to do it, always says she can cook but never cooks a whole meal correctly or without help, and always has “great ideas” that no one asked for. 

One month later, she got a room in a shared flat at the town she is working, so she moved out. First weekend away, she came over to our house. I was ok with it because maybe she was lonely. But then, I noticed she only came over to take stuff back to her place. 

My girlfriend decided to go to her home country for a few days, and she was gonna bring some stuff my sister in law needed. 
So, my sister in law called me saying “I’ll be in your house this weekend”, but she was not asking: she was INFORMING me. 
I said no. 
And as my girlfriend was going to work on Saturday, I told her to come over only on Saturday at the end of the day, as she does not need to be at my place all day with me. 


She always says I am complicated, and picky. But in reality, I just wanna be left alone, and not have to deal with a woman child all day at my own house!

I don’t want her to feel too comfortable at our place, because I don’t her to come over very often.

1p9sllv,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1p9sllv/the_journey_of_me/,The journey of me...,"please note, this is informative and based solely on my own experiences, nothing else nothing more.

  
So about 10 years ago(33) I started noticing that i was extremely tired all the time, hands were constantly tingly and numb, feet and toes were tingly and extremely sensitive(if i walked barefoot which i use to do alot i could feel everything it was hard to walk sometimes. obviously I kept complaining to my dr, who in turn always said i was fine(even when initial sugar tests would be around 150+) and would never run a1c tests.

  
Lived like this for a few years just getting worse, I couldn't concentrate, hell at this time i was a database and script developer for the fusion delphi fork for a ragnarok online private server software, and freelanced scripts for eAthena, which i could do with my eyes closed, until i couldn't, couldn't concentrate, couldn't remember what i was doing, couldn't even remember simple functions and syntax, to the point where i was unable to pay the bills doing so anymore, so i got a real job which required DOT, upon initial certification nothing was a problem(but they only drug tested me, no protein or sugar test as is required(and that facility was shut down at some point..))

  
everything just got worse, dr still said i was fine, then 2 things happened.. The ""Little friend"" stopped doing his job(pging it here) which happened to be just before my next DOT at a different facility, who only gave me a temp 3 month card as they actually did test the sugar in the pee which was Sugar+++ on the result, and highly encouraged me to see my dr, who even after see that said i was still fine their test was wrong(mind you this has been several years and still no A1C) and that the friend not working was in my head.

  
at that point(i have anger issues :D) i gave his ... a piece of my mind which was no where near disney pg rated at all. and he had me escorted out.

  
a week later i was at a new drs office(and still my current dr) when i went through everything i had noticed all the history and the DOT screening results he immediately did an A1C.... 15.8%

  
he immediately put me on the following..

invokana, arcabos, metformin, actos, there were 2 more but I can not remember the names.

trulicity came in at some point but i wasn't enjoying that at all.

  
he then required me to see him monthly with monthly a1c checks. on the 4th month my a1c was down to 9. of course i felt like absolute shit the entire time, worse then ever, he said it was to be expected as we were dropping my sugars and A1C extremely fast and i was use to extremely high sugars all day every day.

out came mounjaro, with my complaints about the trulicity he switched me to it, first dose kicked my ass(used abdomin) second and subsequent doses i used my thigh and very little side effects if any.

  
within 6 months A1c was down to 7 and we came off everything but the metformin and mounjaro. and appointments after ever 6 months.

  
then came the mounjaro shortage because everyone wanted it for their weight loss.... even with a proper diet, without the mounjaro my sugars averaged 250+ a1c went back up to 9, at that point i started a modified keto diet, and got them back down to 7.8, 

  
all breads carb smart tortillas carb smart etc. the occasional non miracle noodle(those things are nasty!) etc.

  
2 years ago i couldn;t move my arm without extreme pain, after thousands of dollars in tests to rule out the heart( i hate it when they do that because i kept saying I CANT MOVE MY SHOULDER OR ARM) a arm dr(can;t remember the name of said occupation) tried telling me i tore a rotator cuff and wants to do a 30 grand surgery, I didnt believe him, went for a second opinion...

  
THAT dr said ""you have diabetes?"" ... yes sir,, he had t2d aswell and asked me what i know about adhesive capsulitis(frozen shoulder) I said no, he said it is common in people with t2d diabetes he even gets it. gave me a shot(big mistake) and had me do exercises and see a pt, after about 6 months it went away..

  
the big mistake here is the steroid shot skyrocketed my blood sugar for 2 weeks, 400+ all day every day.. i won't get another one.

  
earlier this year i stopped smoking, as soon as i did the blood sugars went up. and stayed up for almost 2 months, drs couldn't figure it out, started smoking again and they went back down(this is the exact opposite of what is suppose to happen)

  
last month i got frozen shoulder on the other side, and without the shot it hurts like heeeeellllll.

  
Currently I am on 500mg of metformin twice a day, 5mg of mounjaro once a week, and a daily 2.5mg dose on tadalafil for the friend...

my a1c last Monday was 7.0

  
my fasting sugars run about 100, my spikes are 140 to 160, my nightly sleeping sugars unfortunately depending on when i eat dinner range from 140 to 225(i work late and often don't eat until about 10-11, then almost immediately fall asleep

  
for my diet i still only eat carb smart bread, when i have noodles or rice they are high is good fibers, portion control is key, i used to eat 2 to 3 giant plates now i barely eat a half a plate and have gone from 350 pounds down to 198.

I haven't had any caffeine in almost 2 years, stopped that cold turkey(and i love my coffee!) at one point i switched from 20+ kickstarts a day(before the t2d diag) to everything diet then kicked it all together.

  
my BIGGEST issue is when i stopped smoking my A1c went up, and me being a dumbass thought the mounjaro contributed(research showed those on insulin products have that effect and not really knowing what is in mounjaro...) nope sugars were still high dr kicked my ass for it too...

  
I have never had any issues with my feet. i mean at one point i dropped a washer and a sofa on both my big toes and screwed the nails up that should be removed at some point.

  
Then there is the retinopathy... the tests here are so damn expensive and since i didn't have any symptoms i never scheduled one(now my eye insurance i have covers diabetic eye exams)

  
september, i started seeing liquid floaters(mind you this was the second attempt to quit smoking and sugars rose)

  
so went and got a basic retinal exam, dr said he can see advanced retinopathy, and wanted me to see their retinal specialist asap the one in their office was booked for a month so i drove up to lansing to see the other, got there at 7, by 8 i was getting a angioplaty? or some shit to see the vessels in the eyes, by 830 am I got a shot in the right eye as there were quit a few bad grown vessels that were leaking(only one eye because A I drove myself and B i didn't know it would go that swiftly) I got the shot in my left a week later.

  
first shot didn't hurt second was painful as hell...

  
within a week new floaters disappeared, my next apt is in january because the floaters disappeared and it looked better he didn't do a shot in october.  of course I have minor floaters again now, but this one is my own fault, just because there are no visible symptooms, does NOT mean it is not happening.



  
some morals here..

  
push your dr, if the A1c would've been tested earlier I could've been handling it earlier...

keep an eye on your sugars, which is pretty easy now, I have used a freestyle libre sensor for 2? years now

  
that way you can know what spikes them and what doesn't.

  
I ate a slice of cheesecake yesterday and spike to 200, within an hour i was back down to 125.

  
I eat ice cream constantly(rebel, its expensive a hell for a pint but ZERO spikes and the impact on the sugars are minimal)

  
Don't wait, again if I would've listened and paid the 300.00 retinal exam fee every 6 months it could've been detected sooner, I may have to have **laser photocoagulation** but my insurance covers that with a copay of like 250 or 300(next year its even cheaper)



through my journey I have been told about ""other methods of controlling diabetes"" or thing of that nature, none of it at least for me is true. just take it one day at a time. even to be told by crazy people that mounjaro is made with snake venom and causes blindness and that it is not ment to take forever.

  
I feel fantastic, a couple scares throughout(numbness on one side of my head 4 years ago, possible heart attack last year etc(but all tests came back good, even the stress test) 

but these problems only surfaced after my employer forced me to get the jab and all subsequent boosters. to keep my job, and it's what actually pays the bills

  
I mean hands and legs are all scarred up, but that's because my 9-5 i move heavy furniture all day and after and on my days off I'm a licensed mobile mechanic, and if i drop something i use my legs to catch it.

  
and of course, get the A1c in line get high blood pressure which has been better since the axing of caffeine

  
as long as i keep doing what works for me, i 'll eventually be sub 5 A1C

  
unfortunately I still don't have full concentration back, and can't even do a simple sql command or function, I used to be able to code in object pascal, C# and C+ with my eyes closed, that is long gone.

  
but atleast I can still turn a wrench

It seems to be that the normal brewing temp can’t be reached anymore.

Do you think it’s an electrical problem?

So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. Yes I can ask chat gpt, but for safety real people experience matter more I suppose. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

Every guy I talk to.. by week 3, they vanish. They have to work on themselves, they find someone else, they feel weirded out by my expression of interest. I literally sent an ENTJ type of guy a video of a rainbow… and playfully said “this is how you make my heart feel” - this was two weeks in after meeting on a dating app. He literally listed this as one of the things he found too intense about me, before leaving. An ENFJ I met recently showed tons of interest, deep questions, but it was LDR. Randomly one day he said “well aren’t we kinda worlds away?” And he hasn’t texted me back since. Another guy I met a while back ago was an istp I think, he only wanted to meet up with me at his house. Would only flirt with me when he was drunk. and after I told him I genuinely just wanted to meet for coffee (I don’t want to “get to know” any guy through intimacy, that feels wrong to me), he suddenly stopped talking to me, then one day randomly made a long post about his love for a girl he’d been talking to. 

Now I know why I loved the forest since I was a child. I didn’t have to perform, didn’t have to meet a perfect ideal for this place, didn’t have to create comfort for it. I could just be and imagine and I could be strange. I am too strange for everyone that meets me, it seems. 

I just wanted to post about this feeling. It’s not uplifting, and I’m sorry. But it’s a pattern and I feel alone in it. It makes me sad. I know that one day I will find the person for me, but it seems like it never works as of now.

1p9shv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1p9shv6/niles_express_life_in_the_machine/,"""Niles Express: Life in the Machine""","Isaac lay on the cold trailer floor in back-obliterating pain, surrounded by a sea of packages—cursing himself for his poor life choices and lack of drive to finish school. His back burned and throbbed; a lightning bolt of spine-crushing pain struck his back with each movement. His ID armband chafed his battered flesh; putting it on felt like putting on the Star of David. In his truck, he felt like an animal at the zoo, an exhibit for people to gawk at and sneer at. Boxes poured down the silly, slide-like chute and crashed over the dented and rusted rollers. Baby strollers, cribs, Pampers, trikes, bikes, trampolines, PlayStation 5’s, Xbox Series X, Tampax, lipstick, Hill’s Science Diet Dog Food, drill bits, soda streams, refrigerators, inflatable sex dolls, pocket pussies, anal beads, cock rings, swimming pools, A/C units, chainsaws, sledgehammers, rugs, tires, dumbbells, kettlebells, golf clubs, packs of Poland Spring, cat litter, swing sets, grills, a Street Fighter stand-up arcade, crossbows, toilets, and tombstones filled the truck. He wiped sweat from his eyes; *Sisyphus wept.*

A red strobe flashed like lightning, illuminating the steel wall. Isaac was a ghoul—a shriveled dark purple ear swollen like a tumor from a “love tap” for clocking in one minute early. His crooked jaw, a monkey wrench to the face for not utilizing team lifts. Souvenirs from past managers. He found his face disgusting every time he saw his reflection and avoided it. Everywhere he went, people glowered at him like he was a cockroach; he was a bug and always had been. He wished a giant shoe would crash from the sky and squash him. 

Isaac’s mind roared: *imagine spending a lifetime buying objects to be buried with them.* A box of paper towels struck the N.E. brand on Isaac’s leg; he scratched the flaky red skin. The flashing red light stung Isaac’s eyes. Mom was right. If Isaac didn’t drop out of med school, he’d follow in her footsteps and be working as a proctologist—pulling a shit-covered Barbie out of some pervert’s asshole would be better than working at Niles Express; but the workload was too rigorous and he couldn’t keep up, so he gave up. Isaac didn’t hate education—he hated the rigid structure, taking cookie-cutter classes just to puke up meaningless information on Scantrons with no guarantee of a better future; subjected to a meaningless structure designed to crush your spirit, flatten your creativity, and individualism reshaping him and his peers into corporate slaves: Consume. Obey. Conform. Die. Hail the machine. Isaac’s mom didn’t talk to him for three days after he dropped out. Isaac lived in his bedroom for a month playing PS4, watching porn, and sleeping all day. One day, Mom burst into his room and dumped a bucket of ice water on him, threatening to kick him out if he didn’t get a job. He hated doing slave labor more than college, so he reapplied to school a week ago, after grueling months of searching, expecting to be rejected. A bottle of glazed donut flavored K.Y. zoomed down the slide. 

*Niles is—people not knowing how judgmental the average Package Handler is—we see what you buy and WE’RE judging you!* 

The trailer was an ocean of darkness; the dock-mounted overhead floodlight near the mouth of the truck hardly illuminated the darkness; a spiderweb crack suffused the dust-covered lens. Insect-like buzzing emitted from the blue, dented industrial fan extended into the truck from the ceiling, weakly blowing air into the truck. A red dot landed on Isaac’s forehead as if it could burn through him. Red strobe lights bounced off the scratched stainless steel walls. Isaac watched flies buzz in and out of his truck with bitter jealousy. His fingers traced the rollers, their screech a requiem. 

*Niles is—a dying machine.* 

Someone clawed ‘FUCK THIS’ into the wall with their fingernails, and faint blood stains smeared the edges. Isaac agreed, but he had to do something for money: Niles was the only place that would hire him and had the best health insurance in the state. Strobing red light consumed everything in the truck—the walls, ceiling, boxes, and Isaac turned red for an instant. Isaac stared at the machine gun equipped with a light bolted to the ceiling near the chute’s mouth. The steel barrel stared through him. The gun was like the Eye of Sauron. It didn’t matter if it fired, if they hit the goal, if he died—nothing mattered at Niles.

Empty shooters, water bottles, silver freezer-pop wrappers, chip bags, and white and yellow plastic straps clogged the gaps and edges of the trailer flaps. Isaac lifted his water bottle to his mouth and drank; the water tasted like antiseptic and burned his throat with each swallow. The smell of cardboard, plastic, and disinfectant saturated the air. Everyone’s morning ritual is different. Isaac’s ritual was hurling his breakfast by the time it took coffee to brew. The water washed away the post-scrambled egg vomit. A surge of energy, euphoria, and bravado networked through his veins and drowned his brain in dopamine. Muscles and veins twitched beneath kaleidoscope skin.  

The crackle of a machine reverberated through the dock. A horrible high-pitched screech cut through the air; from outside the truck, Isaac saw bruised-up workers on their knees sobbing by the conveyor belt on the cement floor. Wails echoed through the warehouse. It didn’t bother Isaac when someone died; dealing with dipshit co-workers wore him down, so he always worked alone; each encounter left him questioning their competency and basic humanity. Finding a competent worker was like Diogenes searching the streets of Athens for an honest man. He ignored the platitudes of his peers because they were faker than green plastic trees, always snickering behind his back—if Isaac died, no one would notice or care. Three trucks down, someone failed to keep their light off. Isaac’s heart thudded in his chest under the red dot’s unblinking dead-shark stare. 

*Niles is—knowing if the gun goes off, your family will get a huge life insurance payout.* 

“More of y’all are going to drop if we don’t hit goal,” a voice from outside the truck snarled. 

 Isaac sprang to his feet and worked arduously building walls of boxes. The red dot swept through the truck and traced him as he worked; the red light of doom flickered off. The disembodied cacophony of screams erupted from behind him. Something — a growl, a voice — said: “Isaac, you need to work faster! This truck missed two thousand packages, and that comes down on you. Are you okay?” Isaac turned around and saw Frank. He grabbed the black walkie-talkie attached to the collar of his garish orange Niles Express polo and muttered something incomprehensible. A gurgle of static responded. A dark blue pulsing vein on Frank’s forehead wriggled like a cluster of roaches and formed a “Y”. Frank held a wooden, gore-stained police baton in one hand and slapped it into the calloused palm of the other. It reminded him of his club when he was a cop. He didn’t want to leave the force, but the department fired him for excessive force after leaving a gangbanger in a pool of gold teeth and blood. He didn’t want to work at Niles, but his wife threatened divorce and promised he wouldn’t see Freddy again. Frank came from a broken home and didn’t want Freddy to suffer like he had.

Frank’s eyes locked on Isaac; he felt like he was looking in a mirror; a twinge of empathy shot through Frank. Frank pictured Freddy’s chubby face staring out the window, waiting for Frank to get home. Isaac’s lack of productivity was keeping him from reaching his incentive bonus. Isaac’s numbers had been in the shitter for weeks and were getting people killed. Worse yet, it was costing Frank money. An image of Isaac sprawled out on the floor, his head a pile of blood, chompers, skull, and brains flashed through his mind like a flashbang. Frank had nightmares of his bullet-ridden subordinates asking him: “Why?” When Frank bashed someone, he was bashing his boss or his boss’s boss’s stupid face, not some lowly grunt. He didn’t like hurting people, but staying productive meant staying alive. His son was turning ten today, and he wanted to make sure he was there for Fred because his deadbeat father had abandoned the family when he was eight. He watched Freddy’s freckled face light up as he unwrapped his Nintendo Switch this morning. If Frank had to smash skulls to stay alive so he could go home to his family every night, so be it.

Isaac grabbed his back and winced. “I’m reporting an injury—every time I move, it feels like I’m being electrocuted.”

Frank gnashed his crooked yellow teeth, cracking them at the root. “Did you get hit by a box?”

Isaac frowned. “This trailer was already a clusterfuck when you sent me to this truck; you handed me this shit sandwich!”

Frank threw his head back and guffawed. “You’re not injured; you’re experiencing wear and tear of the job.” He jabbed the tip of his club into Isaac’s chest.

Isaac pushed the club away. “They’re about to call it soon anyway; the people out there are dropping like flies. I’m not killing myself for this shithole anymore.”

Frank’s eyes softened, and he placed his hand on Isaac’s shoulder. “Look, this is what the boss wants. I understand your frustration, but the boxes still need to be loaded. Can I count on you or not?”

Isaac shoved Frank against the wall. “No!”

Frank white-knuckled his club. “There’s no ‘I’ in ‘team’.” 

Isaac smirked. “No, but there are ‘M’ and ‘E’, which spell me!”

Frank struck the wall with his club. “Everyone else is pulling their weight!”

Isaac stomped on an Apple Watch. “All you are is their lapdog bitch! Is your jaw sore from chugging dick every day!? How’s daddy’s nut taste, pussy!?”

Red seeped into the whites of Frank’s eyes. He bashed Isaac’s knee with his club with a dull *thwack.* “Those people paid good money for that package!” 

Isaac crashed to his knees, fighting back tears, and snot gushed down his face. “I’ll crush all of these stupid boxes; they’re all insured, anyway.”

Frank raised the baton above his head. “I’ll motivate you!”

Isaac grinned wryly. “Motivation isn’t always a good thing—Timothy McVeigh was motivated, and look where that got him.”

Frank’s club collided with Isaac’s face. “You’re too fucking slow!”

Isaac dropped to the ground; each box that zipped past him was like a piece of his life flashing before him. Microwaves, printers, weed whackers, Legos, toy cars, and iPhones whizzed down the ramp. Isaac’s head jerked to one side; blood splashed onto admissions packets; he swallowed a mouthful of blood; crimson crawled between the cracks of gray incisors. The red light flashed on and off. Shoes, black-netted bags, dressers, toasters, drills, tool boxes, cat toys, cat food, and ivory dining room tables whipped past them. Frank smashed Isaac across the mouth, spraying gore and canines all over the 11-inch black dildos 2-in-1 packages. “The load rate is one thousand per hour!” 

Dove soap bottles, Aussie Miracle Curls Hair Mousse - 6oz cans, buzz saws, DeWalt hammers, 9mm rounds, wheelchairs, doors, trash cans, vinegar, olive oil, motor oil, aluminum baseball bats, baseballs, Chewie boxes, HelloFresh boxes, Walmart boxes, and rolled-up carpets dashed past them. A boxed dildo slid down the funnel and crashed into Isaac’s head. “You should stack one package every four seconds!” 

Car engines, mufflers, socket wrenches, puzzles, shovels, adult coloring books, curtains, curtain rods, Bob-O-Pedic mattresses, gaming chairs, toilet plungers, stationary bikes, tricycles, bathroom mirrors, penis pumps, Milk Bones, umbrellas, surgical gloves, and rectal thermometers skidded down the shaft. Isaac’s nose flattened beneath Frank’s club. Crimson spilled from Isaac’s mouth and nose, and tears bled from his eyes. Frank raised his club above his head, chest heaving, teeth clenched in a sick grimace. Frank’s eyes bulged like a bloated corpse’s, veins in his neck pulsed like centipedes trapped under his skin, his eyes as dark as obsidian mirrors. He trembled like a tower about to collapse. “I WILL TEACH YOU ABOUT PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY!”

Just like how junkies bury themselves with their addiction—the consumer is buried by their toys, fifty-five-inch plasma TVs, iMacs, Fitbits, La-Z-Boys, marble countertops, and oak cabinets crashed down the slide. Isaac raised his hands defensively. “Ssshelp!” he mumbled through a broken jaw. Memories of waking up on Christmas morning with his sister and going on family vacations and birthdays cut through him; he’d never make another memory again. Isaac couldn’t tell the difference between the blood and the red light of death bouncing off of him. Isaac’s fingers turned in the opposite direction and broke; bones burst through purple flesh; he clutched his destroyed hand to his chest. Weightlessness. That’s what Isaac felt when he floated out of his body and ascended skyward. Darkness rushed into the corners of his eyes; the truck got smaller and smaller until it was a silver pinprick. 

 *Is that me?*

 

*Where!*

*Am!*

 

*Going?*				   *I!*

*Caasi llits I MA?*

*I WASTED MY LIFE….*

Isaac felt safer outside his body than he ever did inside the useless husk. Death isn’t so bad. Death is no alarms, death is not having to look at myself in the mirror, death is not having to be a disappointment, death is no Niles. At Niles—death is liberation. 

Frank raised the club again. “YOU WILL BE EFFICIENT.”

Isaac imagined himself in a cap and gown crossing the stage, accepting his diploma with his mom in the crowd smiling ear to ear. Mom’s smiling face seared in his mind like a hot branding iron, then melted away like a snowflake on a dead man’s tongue. Frank’s club whistled through the air. Lava bursting from the top of Mount Vesuvius, bombs dropping on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, burned through Isaac’s mind like napalm. Norepinephrine leaked into his brain like a punctured bag of sarin gas on a crowded Tokyo subway. He wanted to drag all the corporate execs and CEOs who profited off the broken backs of the working man while they sit on their fat asses, watching stocks split them open and fill them with hot tar—death to the machine! 

*Niles is—retribution.* 

Frank’s nuts ruptured underneath Isaac’s steel toe. Blood rolled down his legs. The old man dropped to his knees and cupped his sack. The club clattered to the ground and rolled to Isaac. Frank’s cobalt eyes softened, his calloused lips trembled, and his mouth pulled back into a grimace. Yellow waves of pain washed over him. The laser dot landed on Frank’s chest. The light attached to the machine gun turned solid red. Isaac rolled to the side.

*RATATATATAATATATATATATATATATATATATATATA!*

Something spat through the air; little missiles zipped past Isaac’s face. The trailer smelled of fireworks and tasted like blood. His eyes flared like the red strobe of the gun turret. The racket crescendoed as bullets punched through the garish orange polo as he jerked sporadically like a marionette puppet on crack. Jets of brown-red blood sprayed the silver ceiling and walls. His orange polo hung in shreds, each hole weeping crimson. His mouth snapped open like crocodile jaws; blood flooded over his molars and cracked tongue like water over a broken levee. A tear rolled down his cheek. “I-it… was… Freddy’s….” Frank croaked like a frog with its throat cut. Isaac’s gaze fell to a manila envelope, his name smeared in crimson, lying among the wreckage of packages. Isaac picked up Frank’s bloody club. “You forgot about the light, pig!” Isaac smashed Frank’s “Y” shaped vein. His skull collapsed from the force; a dull, wet thump like a sledgehammer to the skull permeated the air. Frank’s head looked like a cracked eggshell, oozing a pulpy mess of bone and brain. Isaac swallowed the vomit building in his throat.

 The bell rang, signifying the end of the sort. All the conveyors stopped as if a bomb had exploded. Isaac’s jaw swelled to the size of a baseball. He picked up a manila envelope streaked with blood that had his name and address on it. His hands shook with anticipation as he tore the envelope open. Tidal waves of joy crashed over his heart and flooded his veins as he read his acceptance letter to med school; a smile spread over his face—he couldn’t remember the last time he smiled. Isaac folded the letter and stuffed it in his pocket. Isaac rolled out of the truck and hopped over a bullet-ridden corpse splayed over the dock floor, punched out, ambled through security, and limped onto the bus. He felt something he hadn’t felt for a long time: hope.

Thank you for writing such beautiful poems, letters, and stories to me all the time. I wish I was half as good as you are at putting my thoughts down on paper. I am really excited for coffee with you whenever our time comes, I wish it was now. Thank you for sharing our stories and helping me remember our memories. I am looking forward to learning even more. I do have one burning question though. Do you remember how I even asked you out for coffee or what led up to that moment? I am still in disbelief I had the confidence to ask you out because I was really struggling with it whenever I lost my memories. I think the difference is that my heart knew I loved you, but I could not for the life of me, understand why. I just remember being so infatuated with you but it felt wrong to try and get to know the real you without us dating. Have you been thinking about names for our kid or kids? For some reason I think we may be having twins now. I have thought about Joseph (could be middle name) and Serena. Those are my top names right now. I would love to hear your thoughts when the time is right as well. Also, I really want my tattoo back even though I don't know what it was or where I got it. Can you please tell me about me asking you out to coffee next? Or what life was life with us at work before I asked you out 💜? 

  
S - I wanted to provide you with closure finally. I am truly sorry our marriage did not work out. You are not a bad person, but you do need some therapy for working on how to not be so reactive. I know I have made ALOT of mistakes in our marriage, but that doesn't mean the right way to communicate your thoughts is through cruelty. It was too much for me, and that is why our marriage failed. You can say it is cause how I made you feel, but you are also in charge of your emotions and your response. That is what you need to work on for your next marriage to work. You truly were a great wife other than that. You deserve love, and if you can work on how you react to situations, you will be a golden wife to someone. I stayed for all these years because I did notice you were working on it and trying to get better. I just couldn't be along with you anymore on this journey for you to grow. You can absolutely work on how you react, and somebody is going to love and cherish you for every fiber of your being. I understand you want me, but it can't be me. You deserve love and I know you will find it, you just have to be patient. We can be good friends and co parents. I don't have to be out of your life, but my life is with H now. She is my girlfriend and partner. Without our toxicity of a marriage, I know we will be great friends and be able to cherish each other again. I am sorry I no longer carry romantic feelings for you anymore, I really am. Just know, you are a good person. You will find somebody that will love you and you will love them even harder than you loved me. I think our main downfall really is our age gap (not saying its bad or anything) but you had already lived and learned from the mistakes you made and I did not heed your advice. I did learn the hard way, but you can't always spoon feed someone to tell them what to do. Sometimes you gotta make the mistake yourself and learn from it. The way you reacted to me was really hard on me. Really hard and it became too much. Even if H wasn't in my life, I would still choose to be single and living with my mom. I absolutely would want to be your friend still. It was really nice being able to talk with you about having feelings for Hanna even though I didn't understand why. It was really nice being able to grab coffee, share laughs, and talk about our lives while grabbing coffee. I cherish our friendship and even after EVERYTHING that has happened, I still want to be your friend and a part of your life along with our kids lives. I want to be able to come over with H as we enjoy family dinners. We can do all of that, and you can find somebody that is a better match for you. I know Chris is your best friend, but honestly I think you two would be a great couple if you tried to see him in that light. If not, I know you will be able to find someone that really will make you even happier than I ever could. Believe in yourself. You will be an amazing wife to somebody that is a better match for yourself. You deserve love and you will find it. You just need to be patient 💛.",2,1764432203.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

At that point I began seeing a lot more choices that I peaked interest so I began selecting a lot more meals each week and then would narrow them down before the cutoff. Well, I’m only human, and wouldn’t you know it, I missed the cutoff!  I woke up Monday morning to find I had purchased 10 meals!  I sat down with coffee and begun messaging with customer service, “I am sorry” they said, “we can’t unring the bell” they said, “you’re stuck with 10 meals but we can change which option you will receive”. So rather than cooking 10 individual options we modified it to just 5 recipes with 2 orders apiece, a lot more reasonable and the agent confirms the change. I move on and go about my week. On Friday the large box with green sides shows up and it’s all different meals! I can’t believe it, it’s the 10 meals that I originally ordered, not the modified order that was confirmed by the agent. I’m pissed!  I message them immediately and you know what they did?!?  They refunded me for everything! Even shipping! I mean, how can I be upset about that? I’m going to give a few to my sister, and a few to my dad, so it’s all going to be eaten. Seems that so many posts on this sub are negative and bashing the brand, but I’m really happy with the resolution! It all started with my mistake but they still fixed it.

She seemed nice, well-spoken, and genuinely mature. She joined a few months ago, and in the beginning I didn’t pay much attention to her. After about a month, she suggested that the two of us, along with two of my colleagues, should go out for coffee. We agreed, and that’s when I sensed she might be interested in me. Later she texted me saying she had a wonderful time and wanted to spend time together, just the two of us.

Over time, I started liking her too. She often said everything felt magical and right. She also says she admires me for my courage and how far I’ve come considering my background.

We met several times and even went on a short trip to Varanasi with some close friends. Everything felt great. I gave her a gift and she wore it with a lot of affection.

Later, she was planning to move back to Noida for work. We were talking constantly, but suddenly she went silent for two days. When she finally replied, she said she was unwell and stressed because people close to her were questioning her about past mistakes. She’s a cancer survivor and gets sick easily, so I understood, though I never really got a clear explanation for the disappearance. Those ten days were extremely confusing.

After that, things returned to normal. She often talks about her male friends “standing up for her.”

There was another moment where she said she would be staying in a hotel with two college juniors. I wasn’t comfortable with that, she said they treat her like a sister, and we argued before she cancelled the plan.

Financially, our backgrounds are very different. She earns almost three times more than me and comes from a wealthy family. I support my family and have EMIs, and she knows this. But despite earning more, she rarely offers to pay for anything. I’ve even struggled in front of her, and unless I directly ask, she doesn’t initiate. This feels unusual to me.

Recently, she had a heated argument with a tenant. Her father didn’t step in. She called me crying late at night. I couldn’t reach her instantly, but I took a bus around 2 AM after borrowing money from friends, and reached by morning. We spent the day together and she seemed better. Later she visited my city and we stayed together for a few days without issues.

Then she went back home, met her male best friends, and according to her, they criticized me for not confronting the tenant. She told me she defended me.
Two days later she said some school friends went and slapped the tenant, though the story sounded a bit exaggerated.

She then told me, “Don’t get offended, but a lot of people expected you to do something and said you didn’t.”
That comment really bothered me, so I ended the call. Now she wants to meet and talk.

At times it feels like she wants to stay in this relationship, but the situations and comments leave me confused about what’s actually going on between us.

Age: 26F, 27M.
What I would like advice on is:
How should I understand this pattern of behaviour, and what would be the healthiest way to approach our conversation so I can express my concerns clearly while also understanding her expectations?

I started an animation MFA at a prestigious school 4 years ago.

And I didn’t get what I wanted— to be a functioning artist in the field.

————————— 

It was a top art school by any measure, the campus looks like a dream. But the curriculum didn’t prepare me for 2D ani fundamentals, no cool animation tests runs or workshops, I fumbled through learning English irl for the first time— hell I remember I asked my classmates what’s the difference between “drawing” and “painting” because in my language those were the same word.
(I also remember when hanging out with friends, a girl said” when dating everything goes well then sometimes boys give the ick…” and I bursted out “holy! Boy gives the egg?”)

It was my first time ever in US( international student), I had $56000 scholarships at that school, everything seemed promising.

The truth is, I have some basic drawings skills, built a decent portfolio with ADHD superpower, some poetic way to use my words that somehow transcended language barrier that might tricked the administration to think I’m worth taking in —and that’s it.

… Learned to draw background arts for the first time, wasted a year on thesis concept development; learn to be healthy after a huge traumatic event after COVID, lost 100 lbs in one year, went through therapy for the first time learned about CPTSD and why my thesis was so important to me to a point of obsession, struggled with new found hobby (weed!) and depression, and burst through last year of TIP through sheer will, adderall, coffee and conviction. 

And my film was MID at best. 

But I somehow graduated through my killer public speech at the faculty critic; my poetic writing of thesis paper that was apparently so tear jerking it bent the fabric of reality, my school put my film at the end as the CLOSING FILM at theater. ( no awards but graduation itself was a miracle to me.)

—————————

Honestly can I rant a lil bit? The$56k scholarship might actually be a money paw type thing. At that year only 3 of us got that much scholarship, one is an amazing artist with a huge follower to begin with(may everything goes well with her), the then is me a funny Asian FOB(fresh off boat) , and the other is my amazing Indian bro with drinking problems who got stabbed on the street at 5 AM. (he didn’t graduate).

No I will not elaborate. 

No drama.  

NO.

—————————

Then I fumbled a whole year going through job hunting, a crush and a sad breakup, knowing full well my skill sets are not industry ready. 
So 4 years has passed, I am no longer the ambitious FOB with a dream in his early 20s. I’m getting old.

:(.

—————————

:)

I still want to make to do it. 
I yearn for it, I was so sure if I had the same scaffolding as my friends did, surely I can build something for myself.

Animation is so ass, it’s so skill based, it takes so long to do, 2D animation is so tedious and skill based YOU DON’T SEEM TO GROW even if u grinned so long, 3D animation could be so expensive in terms of production and ONE PERSON CANT GO FAR. 
AI!  Freaking AI! UGHhhh!



But I still want to do it.

—————————

So I’ll be back. 
Give me a 6 months or a year, I’ll do the intense growth, do an impossible.

FK Scholarship, FK prestigious title, FK traumatic life events that shape my head into this weird ahh pathways and FK Excuses.

Post-trauma growth time. 

I’ll relearn, retrain, reinvent myself, make a portfolio so good my toes gonna crawl.

Or maybe it’s just me?,"My friend M25 and I F25 have been friends for a little over a year. I met him right before I started dating my boyfriend M30. We all go to the same gym and so they also naturally became friends too.

We all hangout together and individually. We have a friend group of around 10 or so. Now this friend is rich. I’m talking thousands of dollars rich. You’d never know because he drives a shitty car and has a full time job that doesn’t exactly give “rich” but his family is rich and he’s had multiple people pass away and for some reason everyone leaves everything to him. Not his parents, not his sisters or brothers, but to him.

So he does this thing where he’ll randomly buy one of us (out of the 10 friends we have) something super extravagant. He bought one of our friends an expensive gun because he thought it was funny they way they reacted (“what” “no way” “why the heck would you do this?”) he says he loves to piss people off (in a good way) with getting them something they could never get themselves.

He has a pattern of spending money on females he likes too but they never like him back. He’s has paid a $700 bill for a girl he talked to ONCE because he thought she was cute and even though he paid that bill she still turned him down when he asked her out. He was mad about that for a long time. He also has this ex girlfriend he says he spent a ton of money on but she ultimately broke up with him and he hasn’t let that go. He also did have this other friend who he bought a really expensive limo rental for her, for her wedding, and she didn’t invite him to the wedding.

Within our friend group we’ve had a few people come and go and specifically we’ve had 3 females all come and all get bought something REALLY expensive by this guy and he asked them all out and they all said no. 

He also very consistently buys my boyfriend really nice cuts of meat, nice alcohol, he even paid for new tires on his car because he said he was thinking about getting them soon.

Here is the thing - he’s NEVER bought me anything. We’ve gone out to dinner and he’s picked up the entire check before but that’s including all our friends. My bf and I have hung out with this friend and he’s swiped his card for my bf and I when my bf was intending on paying but he’s never bought or paid for anything specifically for me.

At first I thought it was a sign of respect for my boyfriend. Plus I’ve never minded that he doesn’t buy anything for me. However NOW things have changed. 

I work at a local restaurant and he came in one morning for breakfast. He had his work uniform on (he works in another city, like a 5 min drive away from his house) the restaurant I work at in a 20 min detour in the opposite direction.

He asked me if I liked coffee and I said yes, he pulled out an iced coffee from Starbucks. I was like wtf is this for? And he said it was for me. I took it and said thank you and he sat down ordered breakfast and left.

I told my boyfriend about it and he said he probably felt like he should bring me something if he was gonna come get breakfast at the place I worked. He didn’t care or think anything about it.

This friend started to come see me weekly. Then twice a week. Every time sitting down to eat breakfast. Everytime he brought me an iced coffee.

At one point he started coming in and giving me the iced coffee and just leaving. No sitting down for breakfast. Now why would he drive 20 min out of his way to give me an iced coffee?

My boyfriend had no issue with him bringing me this iced coffee, even told me it’s saving him $$$ because now he doesn’t have to pay for my iced coffee lol.

It started escalating when one day he walked into my restaurant, no iced coffee, but a bag. I grabbed it and he walked out and lo and behold there was a pair of Nike blazers in the bag. I mentioned that I wanted a pair for my birthday in July to my friends. It was February when he gave me these. 

Fast forward another few months of getting iced coffee. It’s now November and I asked my friends to come Christmas shopping with me. This friend was the only one available. I was also wanting a guys opinion on things I could get for my bf. 

So off we went and it was a nice day, went to a couple of stores, bought some good gifts etc. we stopped at our last store, Target. He walked over to the electronic section saying he needed to pick up a gift for one of our friends. I followed and next thing I know he’s buying a $600 microphone, accessories for a microphone, anything and everything you could think of to start a podcast.

I want to start a podcast. I feel suspicious. I asked who he’s buying all of this for. He says me. He spent over $2000. 

Why would he buy that in front of me? Why would he spend that much money? He’s bought some nice things for our friends but nothing near $2k.

I go home and tell my boyfriend about it. He says he feels as though it’s disrespectful. I agreed. He feels as though now he must spend $2k on me for Christmas or something because now another man has spent that much money on his gf. I agreed and said I’d ask him to return everything because I also felt weird about it.

My bf asked me not to. Said he wants me to accept the gift because it’s very generous, would save us both money because we no longer have to purchase these things. Our friend might also feel disrespected and in the future we will just ask that he talks to my boyfriend if he wants to buy me anything.

Okay so then everything was fine. I get the text. This friend wanted me to know that when we were out shopping one of his co workers saw us. He was also posting us shopping on his Snapchat. Everyone was asking him “who’s the girl?” “Finally got a gf?” And instead of just saying “no that’s my friend” or something like that. He just didn’t say anything.

He kept telling me “isn’t that funny everyone thinks you’re my gf” or “got another text someone said you’re too pretty for me.”

I didn’t reply. Now when he hangout he makes comments like “be glad you have a bf who likes you even though you are plus size” and this one actually hurt my feelings “I’d never date someone with fake teeth” (I had to get my teeth redone for a medical reason and he knows that, I’m insecure they look fake af)

He no longer brings me iced coffee. I think that by me not responding to his texts or acting overly grateful for the gifts, or not acting “pissed off” because he spent so much money he feels rejected.

(speaker yawning) mm? Strange, this isn’t my bed.

\[rope tugging\]

(calm) Ropes around my legs and hands, holding me down in a chair. Cliche, but effective. (calls out) You there, in the shadows watching me, I assume you're responsible for tying me up?

…

Well at least you admit it, but the least you could do is step out of the shadows. You abducted me, I think seeing what you look like is a fair request. 

… 

No, I’m not particularly scared, but you seem to be; hiding back there. You have me tied up, why should you be afraid? 

… \[heavy footsteps\] <the speaker is now standing in front of the tied up listener>

(assured, confident) Ah yes, I recognize you now. Normally we’d be meeting at the checkout lane, having a quick chat before you run off like a shy little lamb. I’ll admit, I didn’t think you were capable of abducting me. Still, nice to see you again outside of work, even if I have some issues with the ambiance.

…

(chuckles, teasing) Deny it all you want, your face is all red. You're stumbling over your words now, just like you do whenever we spoke at check out. Plus, you didn’t bother hiding your face, or are you gonna say it’s some kind of evil twin situation? 

…

(amused) I’m still not scared, because I know you won’t lay a finger on me. I remember being asleep in bed, before waking up here. You took the time to safely capture me, and I am uninjured. If you actually wanted to hurt me, you would’ve done so already. 

…

(laughs) Threats tend to work better when you aren’t stammering, just a bit of advice. To be honest, it sounds adorable when you talk like that. 

…

(calm) I’m not trapped in a strange place, I know exactly where I am. Tied up, in a basement, by you. I may not know the details beyond that, but I know where I am specifically at this moment, and that’s what matters most, according to my coven.

(quoting)  Rule 32 of the Witches guide, ‘A Witch’s most powerful tool is her confidence. Know yourself and where you stand, everything else becomes as natural as breathing’. 

…

(nonchalant) Oh yes, a witch’s coven. Mine is rather small, but my sisters are all very wise. I’ve learned so much from them over the years. 

…

(amused) Ah, your eyes bulging in shock is honestly even more adorable than your stammering. But yes, I am a witch, in the flesh. I’m surprised you didn’t figure it out before, given you were  stalking me.

…

(scoffs) Please, you were clearly visiting the store every week to see me. And you were able to get into my house and carry me away, you had to have been watching me for a while to do that. My pet cat and broomstick collection didn’t set off any alarm bells? Or the giant cauldron I keep in the kitchen?

…

(chuckles) I think the cauldron is a bit much for ‘home decor’, little stalker. 

…

(Blunt) No, I won’t be doing a demonstration of my magic for you. 

…

(Calm) Because it’s not needed, frankly. I can tell by the look in your eyes, you believe me already. Furthermore, magic is dangerous, that’s one of the first things you learn in a Witch’s coven. We aren’t Warlocks, haphazardly slinging spells to try and turn sheep blue, only to blow ourselves up in the process. 

…

(Amused) Even so, that changes nothing about our situation. I know I don’t need to use a single spell to escape, nor do I want to escape.

… 

(Sigh) Because I want to ask, was kidnapping me really easier than just asking me out for coffee?

…

(laughs) there’s that red face of yours again. You know, you're lucky I’ve gotten used to translating your stammering through our talks at the store. So you say you want to charge my parents for a ransom? I call bullshit. 

(continued) I remember mentioning before, my relationship with my parents wasn’t great right now. And If you like me enough to stalk me, you would have remembered that. So it’s cute that you're making shit up to hide your feelings, but it won’t work.

(slightly annoyed) Is admitting you have a crush on me really that difficult? I may be a witch, but I didn’t think I was that scary. (sincere, but joking) I promise, I wouldn’t turn you into a toad or anything, just for asking me out.

…

(sigh) If I wasn’t interested, I would’ve said no, and things would’ve been awkward for a little while, but we’d both move on eventually. You can’t force someone to say yes to a date, I think you know that deep down. You just need to try, and accept whatever happens.

… 

(calm) Maybe you kidnapped me out of fear, but I can tell by the lack of conviction in your voice, you know this wasn’t right. Threatening me and abducting me, really isn’t going to make me love you. 

Oh sure, maybe if it was someone with less confidence, and afraid for their life. Maybe, (emphasized) maybe they would agree to ‘love’ you for the sake of survival… But deep down, you and I both know that wouldn’t be real love, right? 

That knowledge would eat away at you, slowly breaking your heart while they’re dying on the inside from fear… It’s not a scenario that ends well for anyone in the long run. (reciting) Witch’s law #42-’you can’t force someone to love you, not with magic or by force.’

…

(empathetic) And I can tell by looking at you, this isn’t something you're proud of. Shot in the dark, you don’t have a lot of experience asking people out, do you?

…

(gentle) Ah, so you never really asked a casual acquaintance out before. That would explain the stammering and fear, but where did you get the idea of kidnapping me from? 

…

(understanding) I know what ASMR roleplay is. My coven sister Kiera listened to a lot of comfort audios when she was suffering from depression. I’m guessing you listened to a lot of Yandere stuff, then?

…

(chuckles) A fun fantasy, but not really something to build a relationship on. Try to remember that in the future, alright? 

…

(confused) Well, I’m not reporting you to the cops or anything like that. I’m uninjured, and this was all clearly just a big misunderstanding caused by your anxiety. Are you gonna kidnap me, or anyone else again? 

 …

(laughs) I can only imagine the amount of prep work you had to put into this. Not to mention the food cost and concealing my abduction from the cops. You’ve got a large set of stress bangles under your eyes. But the work load isn’t the only reason you won’t do it again, right?

(leading the listener) Finish this sentence, ‘I will not kidnap people and force them to love me because-?”

…

(repeating listener) “Because it’s bad, and I regret kidnapping (speaker name)!”

\[Clapping\]

(praising gently) Very good! Now you're getting it, good job! Don’t be embarrassed, just take it on the chin and move on. You learned an important lesson, and took a step towards being a better person. Much better than my last stalker.

…

(casually ominous) Oh yeah, I had another stalker before you. Total raving lunatic, tried to physically grab me, threatening me online, the whole nine yards. I turned them into a fish, currently residing in Headmistress Helena’s aquarium until they learn to behave themselves. 

…

(light laugh/giggle) Aw, your eyes are popping again. Don’t worry, I knew you weren’t that kind of  lunatic. I’ve enjoyed our conversations at the store, and I always saw you going to help people who were struggling, even when you were watching me. You were clearly just shy and insecure, and it unfortunately got out of hand.

(gentle) Sometimes, we make mistakes. I remember back when I started as a witch, I gave my rival at work a skin rash that lasted for two weeks. The headmistress really let me have it after that one, I swear she went on for 3 hours about the importance of restraint and emotional maturity. 

<the speaker scooches the chair forward>


(gentle, but stern) You made a big mistake, had it explained to you, and now you feel bad. That’s just life, screwing up and trying to do better. In fact, do you mind untying me? 

\[gentle unbinding/unraveling of ropes\]

(chuckle) Good boy/girl, thank you. Although judging by that look in your eye, it seems like you still have something on your mind.

…

(gentle) Valid concern, some people do only change because someone else holds power over them. It’s possible you're only listening to me, because I could overpower you if I wanted. But the thing is, you chose to listen. Some people don’t even get that far in the process.

The fact you respected me, regretted this from the start, and let me go, while agreeing not to do it again? That tells me what kind of person you are deep down. A human, flawed, but only needing a gentle scolding to change. And I really do think you're a good person, just driven to do something bad by the fear of loneliness. I know you’ll do better from now on, cause I’ve seen the type of person you can be otherwise, and I like that person, a lot. 

…

(gently) You're welcome, think nothing of it. 

\[awkward silence\]

(breaking awkward silence) Sooooo, what was gonna be your sales pitch?

…

(playful) Your sales pitch! You know-your big love confession, excessive praise and worship, meant to make me believe we were ‘soulmates destined to be together’. Telling me how wonderful and perfect I am. The whole song and dance, I wanna hear it.

…

(laugh) Don’t be embarrassed, you had to have had it planned out. So come on, tell me!

… <Longer pause>

(touched) I’ll push back on you saying ‘love’, we don’t know each other that well after all, stalking aside. But thanks, I really do appreciate all the sweet words. I can tell you really meant all of that, from the bottom of that big soft heart of yours. 

…

(laughs) You're welcome, but you aren’t off the hook just yet. I think I have the right to make a request, seeing as you inconvenienced me on my day off.

… \[heavy footsteps as the speaker approaches to intimidate the listener\]

(teasing, start threatening, but end as playful\] For your punishment, you wicked, lowly, naughty human. I want you… to buy me a coffee and a scone.

… 

(loud laugh) Well, yeah! (affectionate) I’d say you won me over with that sappy confession. But the truth is, I’ve liked you for a while, dork. I was just waiting on you to ask me out first, even if you were taking a while. Given the way you kept striking up a conversation with me at the store, I figured that was what you wanted. 

… 

(touched) I’m not particularly traditional about ‘who asks who’ out. I just figured you wanted to do it. But since you are seemingly too shy to ask… Do you wanna go out on a coffee date with me? 

…

(warm, affectionate) Good, we can work on your confidence later. As for when, how about we go right now? It’s still early in the day, so we have plenty of time to get some coffee and chat. Or tea, whichever you prefer. 

…

(gentle, teasing) No need to worry about getting changed. 

\[finger snap, magic sounds, ambiance of people chatting\]

…

(nonchalant, casual) Oh that? Just a quick teleportation and fashion spell. I hope you don’t mind, but I put you in that outfit you wore two weeks ago. I thought it was a really good look for you. 

…

(chuckles) You’ll catch flies if you leave your jaw hanging like that. I told you I was a witch, didn’t I?

…

(laughing) Well, I don’t like to overuse magic, but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to give you a small demonstration of what a witch can do, when she puts her mind to it.

(gentle, flirty/teasing) So, shall we then, you cute lil dork? Show me you can show a witch a good time, without the rope.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

**Step 1 happened almost without me noticing:**  
One morning, while making coffee, I caught myself thinking about everything that could go wrong that day. It felt heavy. So I tried something different: I asked myself, *“What’s one thing I can influence today?”*  
Just one.  
Sometimes it was my tone in a conversation. Sometimes it was drinking water before I opened my laptop. Sometimes it was choosing not to rush.  
That tiny shift — focusing on what I *could* shape — made the whole day feel lighter.

**Step 2 came next, almost as an experiment:**  
I started stacking a small optimism habit onto routines I already had. After closing the mailbox, I’d name one thing that *might* go right today. Not guaranteed. Not forced. Just possible.  
Because I tied it to something I already did, it stuck.  
And possibility started feeling normal.

**Step 3 surprised me the most:**  
At night, right before brushing my teeth, I started asking:  
*“What went better than I expected today?”*  
Some nights the answer was tiny — “The line at the store was shorter than I thought.”  
Other nights it was bigger — “I handled something calmly that used to stress me out.”

Looking back, that practice rewired more in me than any pep talk ever did.  
I didn’t suddenly become cheerful or delusional about life.  
I just became someone who notices good outcomes *as much as* the challenges.

And that, I guess, is how I became an optimist — by stacking small habits, not by forcing positivity.

Throwing this out there and seeing if anyone else is in the same boat!
I'm a 35 year old engaged fella living in Dublin (northside, but happy to travel) and a very proud dad to three little chaos agents (aged 11, 10, and 3).
The long and short of it is that between work, childcare, and planning a wedding, my social life has gone from 'busy' to 'a mythical creature I only read about in books.' Most of my conversations these days revolve around the appropriate thickness of a peanut butter sandwich and why we can't have ice cream for breakfast.
I genuinely miss having mates guys and girls to do things with, even if ""doing things"" now means slightly more responsible activities than when I was 25!
What I'm looking for:
 * Age range: 30s to early 40s, but honestly, if you're sound, age is just a number.
 * Location: Dublin based or reasonably close.
 * Vibe: Open-minded, down to earth, and understands that sometimes I might need to cancel last minute because someone projectile vomited a Capri Sun.
Things I enjoy (or used to enjoy!)
 * Pubs/Pints: I love a good chat over a couple of pints (or coffees!) I don't need to stay out till 3 AM, but a few hours of adult conversation is gold.
 * Sport: Watching football, UFC, and getting to watch a match is a treat.
 * Food: Always up for trying a new Dublin spot, whether it's a fancy burger or a proper carvery.
 * General Geekery: Love movies, good TV shows, and occasionally sinking far too much time into a strategy game.
If you're also finding yourself marooned on the island of 'Responsibility' and want to change your social calendar from 'Empty' to 'Mildly Busy,' drop me a message!
Tell me your favourite pub in Dublin and what the last thing was that your kids/pets/spouse did that made you laugh!

Office small talk is awkward. Most of us either dread it, fake it, or avoid it altogether. You stand by the coffee machine, someone walks up, and your brain goes blank. Suddenly, ""Nice weather today"" feels like the only sentence you’ve ever known. And the worst part? It’s a daily social ritual we can’t really skip. 

For the longest time, I thought I was just “bad at people”. But after digging into research, social science books, podcasts, and communication studies, there’s a better explanation. Most people never learned how to small talk. Like, no one teaches us. So we rely on awkward scripts or viral TikTok advice that’s mostly fake confidence and buzzwords.

But the good news? Small talk isn’t about being witty or extroverted. It’s a skill. And skills can be learned, practiced, and improved. Here's the stripped-down, science-backed cheat sheet that helped me finally make it feel natural.

Start with one goal only: connection, not performance

 Source: Vanessa Van Edwards (behavioral investigator, author of Captivate)  

   Her research shows that people aren’t looking to be impressed during small talk  

   They’re looking to feel seen and heard  

 Just reframe your mindset to ""make the other person feel comfortable""  

 That shift takes ALL the pressure off you to say something clever or interesting  

Use the ""FORD"" framework to never run out of things to say

 Source: The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane  

 Use these 4 buckets to guide the conversation:

   Family: ""How’s your weekend with the kids?""  

   Occupation: ""What project’s on your plate today?""  

   Recreation: ""Doing anything cool after work?""  

   Dreams/Development: ""You mentioned working on that course, how’s it going?""  

 These are universal topics that people enjoy talking about  

 Way better than repeating ""crazy weather lately"" for the fifth time this week  

Keep one “go-to” opener that feels natural to YOU

 From Harvard Business Review's article Better Small Talk  

   They suggest staying away from generic openers and making small talk more personal  

 A good example: ""Hey, what’s been the highlight of your week so far?""  

 Or something simple like “Did this week feel long to you too?”  

 Use your environment. If you’re in the breakroom: “This coffee feels stronger than usual”  

Use “conversational threading” to keep things flowing

 Source: Communication coach Celeste Headlee (TED Talk: 10 Ways to Have a Better Conversation)  

   She says most people listen to reply, not to build  

 The trick is to pull a thread from what they just said, then ask about it  

   They mention a dog? Ask what breed  

   They say they’re traveling? Ask where to  

 Feels more like a real conversation, less like a tennis match of small talk clichés  

Avoid the #1 killer line: “What do you do?”

 Source: Priya Parker’s book The Art of Gathering  

   It reduces people to their job titles  

   Also makes people feel judged if they don’t like their job  

 Instead try:  

   ""What keeps you busy during the week?""  

   ""What’s a typical day like for you?""  

 Opens the door to hobbies, side projects, or passions that lead to real connection  

Use “pings” to build micro connections throughout the week

 Source: Adam Grant (WorkLife podcast episode on workplace friendships)  

   He calls these small, regular check-ins “pings”  

   A ping can be as simple as a Slack emoji reply  

   Or a quick “Saw this article and thought of you” DM  

 These tiny moments compound into actual workplace relationships over time  

Follow the 40-40-20 rule

 Based on research from MIT's Human Dynamics Lab  

   Effective conversations tend to follow this rhythm:

     40% sharing about self  

     40% asking/listening to the other  

     20% mutual discussion or reactions  

 If you’re doing all the asking, it feels like an interrogation  

 If you’re only talking about yourself, it feels self-centered  

Know how to exit a convo without being weird

 One tip from The Like Switch (former FBI agent Jack Schafer)  

   Use a “graceful out”:  

     ""Hey, I’ve gotta run to a quick call but this was really nice""  

     ""Gonna grab my lunch before the line gets wild, talk soon?""  

 Add a reason + a compliment. Keeps it smooth, not abrupt  

Bonus: 3 phrases that work in basically any situation

 “That’s interesting, tell me more about that”  

 “How did that go?”  

 “Oh wow, I’d never thought about it that way”  

These are conversation glue. Use them when your brain blanks out  they always work  

Most people fake small talk or overthink it because they assume others are judging them. Truth is, most of us are just as anxious, just trying to get through the day and connect with someone who feels safe. The tools above aren’t manipulative tricks. They’re just how real human conversations work when you understand the social wiring.

This worked for me.,"Isn’t it a romantic idea to wake up at dawn daily and welcome the first rays of the sun? Fresh and full of energy? To do some meditation and yoga and be fully ready to face the day? Whatever comes!

I always wanted to do it. But just couldn’t get out of bed.  Always postponed it for the next day. Except on rare occasions.

But now I wake up before dawn. Fresh. Almost every day. And that too without the alarm clock.

And I have enough time for my yoga and meditation. With calmness and focus. No more rushing.

How did this change happen?

Well, a couple of years back I started listening to the YouTube lectures of a US Cardio on fasting. I had about 20kg excess body weight and fatty liver. And nothing I did seemed to work. The doc is very witty and explains in very simple words. I understood clearly the biochemistry of ketogenesis or fat burning.

So I put my self (gradually) into a 36hrs fasting twice a month. The results were miraculous. I lost 13kg in 3/4 months and felt much better. On other days I had whatever I was having before.

Next, after about a year, I started aiming at the 6 hrs daily eating window. (Eat only in the 6 hrs window, rest of the time only water or black tea/coffee without sugar). I couldn’t do it strictly.  But I have my light dinner before 6PM and nothing after that. I eat my usual stuff, no restrictions there.

It greatly improved my energy level and alertness. My sleep quality also improved and I woke up automatically at dawn, fresh. I had learnt yoga from Shivananda Yoga Center and later from Sadhguru’s Isha. Now I had enough time to do the yoga and meditation properly in the morning before the regular daily activity.

My time just dilated to include meditation and yoga just by tweaking my food habits.

Something which also makes a lot of sense is being aware whether it is my body asking for food or just my mind craving out of habit. Its something I inferred after listening to Sadhguru.  Infact I was surprised to learn that both Sadhguru and Dr. Jamnadas eat only one meal a day. They say it is the best for a mentally alert, healthy and active life. So that’s my next target. I think it will help me further in my meditation. However, the caution here is that one must consult their physician especially if one is suffering from diabetes and other diseases before fasting.

And did you know Sadhguru has many delicious recipes for meditators?",18,1764430789.0,Meditation,1,0.91,False

So, I got out and my mouth felt dry, so, I made my way to the sink, where I filled up a kettle with enough water for 1.5 cups to be boiled, little did I know there was slightly less, and this ratio of liquid was perfect for a faster boiling time anyway because the kettle can take a couple hours to boil if the ratio is wrong.

So, I then made my way to the window with a cup of coffee I made, plus ignoring my gut instinct to go to the toilet, like literally ignoring my needs to release a poop. And sat and had a coffee by the window and I checked over some updates or whatever on my phone.

So, because I had ignored my gut instinct previously, to go to the toiled initially. I then went there after I had woken up with a coffee, so, I just had to use the toilet when I finally decided to go there.

Little did I know, the main problem was the knots I tied around my waist, It was far too tightened for a quick release, so, I was there for 10 minutes just jumping around trying to untie an impossible knot, it was super awkward to hold in my poop without releasing out my butt into my pants.

So, then, finally I got free after going to the mechanic shop and the guy welded my pants off so I went back home and let out a seriously massive, king king, super bomb, jimmy neutron, mega tron, misty, fart, piles and pellets of poop stacking to the ceiling & blocking the bathroom completely, there was just a mess everywhere and stinky, true toxic waste pollution.

So, I just picked up the phone, I had to call the emergency line and immediately I was transferred to the police department where they handled my sticky situation quite swiftly. I was sent 3 of the best plumbers in the country to flush my toilet of this super massive turd.

I saw  her was looking at new ones in our Amazon account. We are both in our 50s.

We have a Delonghi Nespresso Lattissima that we’ve had for a decade. Before that, we had a regular espresso machine, grinder, the whole setup. 

I think she’s looking at one where she can buy a couple bean flavors and put them into hoppers and have it make the espresso drink automatically. She likes latte’s and drinks them every morning. I like mochas.  My sons like Mochas and Lattes. Both hot and cold. I don’t know much about making espresso drinks (and I’m sure it shows). 

She seems to be looking for for the easiest platform that can do milk, frothing, mixing, cleanup, where she can swap beans in and out. She has some Kona beans a friend gave her she wants to try. 

She was looking at the JURA GIGA 10 Fully Automatic Espresso Machine with Cold Brew, but it’s a little out of our price range, and some reviews says it breaks more often than works. I’m not sure it will fit our counter space either. The Lattissima espresso machine we have now fits well with 8 inches of clearance above it. 

Between her, me, and our two adult sons who come by in the morning for coffee with their Mom and Dad (me!), we go through about 10 capsules a day. We’ve done this so long that it’s hard to notice the difference even between nespresso until we go out and get a real espresso drink. 

We got rid of our old manual espresso machine before the Lattissima because it took too long to make 4 drinks for 4 people heading out in the morning. About 50 minutes including warmup to cleanup. I think she’s looking thinks for something more automatic, not capsule based, that can make 4 drinks in the morning in about 15 minutes.

When everyone slows down, the agents who keep growing use this month for something most people ignore:

**Building real relationships.**

Not lead-gen gimmicks.  
Not holiday email blasts.  
Not “touching base.”

Actual, human connection.

And here’s the simple truth most of the industry sleeps on:

**A handwritten note beats everything digital.**

It takes five minutes.  
Costs less than a cup of coffee.  
And lands 10x deeper than another “Happy Holidays!” mass email.

A lot of people assume handwritten notes are old school. Meanwhile, some of the most successful people in business built entire careers on this habit. Brian Buffini. Harvey Mackay. Mark Cuban still writes them. Jon Gordon sends daily encouragement notes. Joe Polish built high-level networks almost entirely through personal thank-you cards.

The point isn’t the stationery.  
The point is the *signal* you send:

# “I care enough to slow down and write this myself.”

That’s the kind of thing people remember, and it’s why handwritten gratitude today turns into a referral in April, or a conversation you didn’t expect in February, or a client who sticks with you for life.

So here’s the December challenge:

**Write five handwritten notes a day until December 31.**

No overthinking.  
No automation.  
Just five people you appreciate, every day.

You’ll be shocked at what comes back.

Use December to deepen relationships while everyone else goes to sleep.",1,1764430377.0,RealEstateMindset,0,1.0,False

When they announced controller support, I'll admit I was skeptical. How do you even translate all those complex building mechanics, the precision needed for factory layouts, all the menus and hotkeys... seemed impossible to do well on a controller.

Well, I was wrong.

This is hands down the best controller implementation I've ever experienced in gaming. Period. It's not just ""good for a factory builder"" - it's genuinely exceptional across all genres I've played.

The ergonomics are absolutely perfect. Everything feels intuitive, nothing feels like a compromise or workaround. I'm 50 hours deep into my controller playthrough and it's pure joy being able to build massive factories while chilled out on my couch.

Coffee Stain deserves massive props for this. They could've half-assed it or made it ""functional but clunky"" like so many PC-to-controller ports. Instead, they created something that feels like the game was designed for controller from day one.

To anyone on the fence about trying controller support - do it. You might never go back to M&K (I probably won't).

1p9rors,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1p9rors/horrifying_memories_starting_to_resurface/,Horrifying ‘memories’ starting to resurface.,"i’m not entirely sure where to start with this,, but something happened last week that kinda shook me up and i’ve been spiralling ever since. for context im 14m. anyway, this one particular day i was super exhausted after school and ended up drifting off on my couch, but instead of just falling asleep, i got stuck in this weird half awake half dreaming state. it felt like i was floating between being asleep and awake, and then i started visualizing myself as a little kid.

there i was, on my stomach on a bed with these bright white sheets, in a room with dark blue walls and Winnie the Pooh stickers plastered all over them, and the blinds shut with just a dim lamp lighting everything up. there was this mirror closet at the end of the bed, and when i looked in it i saw myself,, and my face was bright red and i was crying, like really sobbing violently like something terrible was happening, way more than just a tantrum or something. sorry if this part is graphic, but i could feel a big hand pressing down hard on my back, pinning me in place and suddenly i felt this burning pain starting at my anus and shooting up, along with these horrible squishy wet sounds. it was so vivid and graphic that i felt it all throughout body, like physically, like it was actually happening and NOT just a dream. 

when i snapped out of it i was drenched in sweat and couldn’t breathe, it literally felt like ALL of the air had been sucked out of my lungs, my chest felt all tight and tingly because of my extremely high heart rate, and i started having a full blown panic attack.. because it felt like something that actually happened to me. it didn’t feel like any normal dream i’ve ever had, more like something my mind replayed as if it was a real memory i’d blocked out and repressed since that time. 

again, this ‘memory’ was not dreamlike or fuzzy at all. like every sense dialed up to max volume.. i could feel it all in my body.

in the days that followed i remembered something my mom told me about how in pre-k, i was always weird and withdrawn around this one staff guy,, and it was puzzling to her because he seemed so gentle and loving towards the other children so she basically just chalked it up to me being shy. he was chubby, had a beard, and wore those thin, wiry glasses. as i kept thinking about it, his face kept getting clearer in my mind. there are bits i remember now, like being in his cubicle office with toys lined up everywhere, and how i’d just stand there stiff and frozen, turning away from him and squeezing my eyes shut, although i have no idea what he was doing during those moments. but i know that every time i left his office i’d have a new toy.

as i kept fixating on it and replaying certain things over and over in my mind, i remembered this one time being dragged up some old wooden stairs after making him mad once by spilling his coffee, and being thrown like a ragdoll onto that same white bed with the same mirror closet at the end. i’d see myself start to get red and cry and scream as he stood there behind me. im starting to have panic attacks a lot more now thinking about it, it feels like the more pieces i put together of this puzzle, there more it’s rotting me from the inside out. all i can think back on now is how empty and depressing my early childhood felt, and how small and powerless i felt during those moments in that room.

also ive started to do a bit more research on this subject, and behaviours that i displayed afterward, from 6-10 ish, really worry me and are confirming my worst fears even more… ever since i can remember i used to have this habit of squeezing my penis like whenever i was stressed, in public too. due to my age and stuff I don’t do it in public anymore, i stopped like years ago 😭. i still do it in private but it has ZERO sexual stuff attached to it, the same thing with inserting things inside of myself when i was stressed out, i never obviously did that in public, but i used to do it with pen tips, marker tips etc and it felt oddly comforting to me. if that makes sense? but none of these things were done in a sexual manner at all, from the time where i was like 5-10 i didn’t even understand the concept of ‘sex’ and was never taught/exposed to that sort of talk. all i know is that these things felt relieving and comfortable. but i now realize that they were NOT normal.

I’m Swiss, born and raised near Zurich, and I’m currently working as an IT consultant.

Lately I’ve been playing with the thought of changing careers. Even though a coffee shop would be a real passion project for me, I also need to seriously consider the financial side and whether staying in an office job might be the better choice long term.

My dream would be to move into gastronomy and open a coffee shop – maybe even a few more later on – focused mainly on good coffee and simple food like snacks and sandwiches. I’m thinking of something in the style of places like Draft Coffee, Amiamo Caffee or Sacchi Bar.

I know that the restaurant business in general can be very hard and risky. Maybe I’m getting this wrong and it’s not really something you can measure clearly in numbers, but I’m wondering: is it usually a constant financial struggle, or can it also go relatively smoothly if it’s done right?

Does anyone have an idea of what a coffee shop in a bigger city like Zurich, Basel, or maybe Baden (AG) can roughly earn (revenue and/or profit)? Any ballpark figures or personal experiences would br super interesting.

It’s been stressful and I just bought this game yesterday and have been looking forward to playing it. I wake up very early and hopped on and played for a couple of hours while everyone else was sleeping. 

It’s a lot of fun but I got frustrated so many times trying to satisfy the needs of my little kingdom, all the while losing money like crazy and not having all the resources I needed to build things. When I heard people stirring in the house I shut it off partly out of frustration and also knowing I wasn’t going to be able to keep playing for long anyways. 

As soon as I go make myself a cup of coffee to start the day my cat starts meowing at me, so I go to pet him but then my dog gets jealous and starts harassing him so I had to do a double pet to satisfy both of them—but I realize what my cat really wants is water. So I go to take the purified water filter out of the fridge (dog staring up at me all the while still wanting pets) but no one filled it after last use so I fill that from the sink and pour the cat some fresh water before I can finally get to my cup of coffee. I see my wife is up right as I’m about to take a drink and she asks “hey is that coffee for me?” I give her my cup of coffee and go to make another and the Keurig is also out of water now. I refill the water purifier again and am about to make another cup when the MIL walks in and asks what’s for breakfast. My first 10 minutes of life after this game and it felt exactly the same as when I was playing.

He kept notes on his phone that were locked of all of our significant interactions and little things about me, what my name meant, things I liked, things I would say that he found funny.  I would tease him that someday he was going to get a girlfriend who would not appreciate these notes, he said he would rather die than delete them.  He planned on keeping them hidden away forever.


At one point I found out that he had a fireproof safe that he kept everything I had ever given him, like birthday cards and funny little notes.  However he also kept every gum wrapper from every piece of gum and an empty air freshener.  He would bring the safe with him to his mom or dad’s house depending on where he was staying that week.  It came off to me as really strange and obsessive and then I came across an article on Sam Vaknin’s site that talks about this exact thing, an excerpt from the website:

“Souvenirs and mementos serve as memory aids for most people, but for psychopaths, serial killers, and narcissists, these objects represent a pathological need to capture and possess their victims rather than evoke memories or emotions. Their collections are driven by a disrupted sense of self and a compulsive need to prove their existence, often leading to a fixation on the victims themselves rather than the experiences associated with them.”

I almost never get sick, even when everyone around me does. I started drinking coffee 6 years ago and I stared having issues with anxiety, gerd etc but still I was healthy otherwise. I continue drinking it although it is causing me severe insomnia to the point of not sleeping 2 days in a row and when I sleep, I never get deep sleep. I quit for 2 months last year and that's the best sleep I ever get, solid 9 hours and sleeping within minutes. And also I felt so calm and Dp/dr was gone. But I started again despite this.

2 months ago I started drinking a lot coffee and I was so anxious to the point of not paying attention to anything. To keep it short, I made a terrible mistake I wouldn't make otherwise while traveling.  The mistake is so embarrassing I won't even mention it here. As if the mistake itself isn't enough, I ended up getting a horrible life threatening foodborne illness as a consequence in addition to several other issues.



Both my physical and mental health has been declining ever since that mistake. This also reminded me of all other mistakes I made in the past 3 years under the influence of this evil drug and I feel like can't help but think about ending my life. I could've bought a house by now if I hadn't been impulsively buying stuff and wasting a lot of money. It also ruined my social life. I haven't slept in 2 months because of regret and anxiety(some days I get 2-4 hours, most days none). I'm going to be fired now because i can't function at all. 

This drug ruined my health, my social life, my future, my job, everything.  
Some of you may think it's not the caffeine that did all of this, please stop!

After fighting it by learning how to dive, skydive, shooting guns & bows, going to the gym, meditation, throwing myself into life and parties in the hope this is a psychological thing, a doctor in South Africa helped me on the right track (they are amazing with anything about the immune system).

Here's what helped me:

**1. Antihistamines**. But only very specific ones. Anything containing ""Desloratadine"" or ""Loratadine"". It's the only medicament I take now. 1 pill a day. Sometimes 1 every 2 days. Nothing else. No other Antihistamine works at all.

If you feel as if ants walk over your body at times, just slightly even, give this a go. Try it. If it helps, you will know 30 minutes after taking one pill. (Also if you feel kind of irritated and with bad thoughts and you feel at the same time like they have no basis in reality)

**2. Food.** The best, most simple test you can do is to do a 5 day fasting. No food at all, only light soup if you have to, and lots and lots of water. If you feel better after day 3 and you feel like your anxiety is gone, then food is your problem. Food has a huge impact on anxiety.

\---------------

If fasting makes it better you'll have a journey ahead to figure out what helps for you specifically, but here's a few universal ones

Coffee, Tea, Cola - Caffeine is a no go. Avoid at all costs. Whatever the source of your anxiety, anything that triggers your nervous system into overload is poison.

Processed foods - Snack bars, candy, chips, microwaves oversalty/sugary/fatty food, sugar drinks. Avoid anything processed. That includes bread.

Fruits, Vegetables - Eat and cook simple food with simple recipes. Have fresh vegetables and fruits, fresh herbs, simple spices. Go for quinoa over rice, for rice over pasta.

Change your diet long term, your gut health improves, your anxiety lowers a lot.

A bit of sports helps, but food is the key for I'd say most cases that come from the physical side.",6,1764429755.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

\--

I started feeling my despair toward them a few years ago, starting with Instagram. I always loved the idea of a place where everyone shared personalized content on their feed. It was supposed to be a photo journal of your life. You could keep up with what friends were doing and follow some photographers and filmmakers.

It kind of worked for a while. Until Meta decided to pick another strategy of squeezing every last bit of your attention toward their app. They started doing everything in their power to hook you as fast as possible and then keep you glued to the screen as long as possible.

The Stories feature was the first step in that direction. It was intentionally developed so you MUST look at whatever everyone else was doing. Otherwise, it disappeared. Then it was reinforced by TikTok‑inspired Reels. The Reels tab was designed to quickly feed you one quick sensational video after another. The sole purpose of that was to glue your eyeballs to the screen.

Instagram doesn’t care about creativity or self‑expression. Creators are not their customers. Businesses are. And businesses want that sweet attention for ads.

I was on and off IG for a few years until I finally stopped using it last year for good.

\--

I was never (thankfully) seriously using TikTok, so I avoided this plague. But as with IG Reels, I went through a difficult journey with YouTube Shorts. I can’t say I watched them a lot, but they were always in my life because I watch YouTube a lot, and I create videos for this platform myself. As a creator, it was immediately clear that this is a huge focus for YouTube. Which is nothing but sad to me, as I genuinely love this platform and the creativity it always promoted. But yet again, another platform was falling into the same pitfall.

After some thinking, however, I realized that it shouldn’t be this way. If my goal is creativity and providing value for people, I shouldn’t force myself to be a slave to the algorithms and big corporations. I settled on the idea to continue creating long‑form content no matter what, and kept distancing myself from YT Shorts.

The only exception I’ve made is for the series I call ""Monday coffee."" I am making them specifically to slow down people’s Shorts feeds, take a breather, and discuss one thing I’m presenting in each week’s episode. This is my answer to short‑form content. I turned it into anti‑algorithm short video podcasts. And I’ve been enjoying making those shorts, too, as they keep me grounded and disciplined.

\--

Lastly, there was text‑based social media, where I’d stayed the longest: Twitter (or how it now stupidly calls itself ""X""). I had always had a special connection to this place. It’s where I learned a lot about the lifestyle I want to live. It’s where I met developers, digital nomads, and indie hackers. It’s where I met an amazing community, even meeting some people offline.

Unfortunately, after the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk (although it started even before that), this place became absolutely insufferable. I thought TikTok was the king of promoting the most ridiculous and controversial type of content just to keep you watching, but X seems to have mastered it on a new level.

In the last few years, the platform turned great communities into a pit with the most controversial, polarizing, rage‑baiting type of content you can imagine. And even people I liked and respected before started either following these rules and posting only ""hot takes"". Or they just became the recycling machines reposting the same thoughts and ideas lacking originality, just because it brought the most views.

It became even worse after AI gained its popularity, and more and more tools started promoting writing AI content. To me, the last nail in the coffin was Typefully (scheduling platform I was using) releasing a feature that will imitate your persona and generate AI tweets for you. All of that completely killed the individuality and community parts I loved so much about Twitter.

So as the last social media in my life, I am done with X too. Now, I am completely off the hook ;)

\---

After some time enjoying my freedom, I started thinking about how to make the Internet feel good again. I definitely recommend watching an incredible [video](https://youtu.be/EO14wPQw89c?si=F6E-6hiE1kY98YPO) by the CEO of Patreon, Jack Conte, who is asking the same question.

I definitely don’t have all the answers yet, but I started by both creating and consuming content more intentionally.

Here are two rules I set for myself:

* Always make content that is fueled by my personal beliefs, creative passion, and value you can provide to real humans. Do not focus on algorithms, hooks, funnels, and other business metrics.
* Consume content intentionally by the creators you discover and feel connected with, instead of allowing algorithms to dictate and ""tailor"" your taste.

It already led to curating how I consume YouTube videos. And since I no longer get my content from social media, I started creating my RSS and newsletters feed again. Honestly, it feels liberating and enjoyable. I feel much more connected to creators, compared to the superficial feed consumption.

I am also intending to return to a proper writing myself (this post actually is my first post on my blog in a while). I am a type of person who likes to share, but I want to do it on my own terms, at my own pace and place, and it should look and feel like me. So I am starting by bringing my blog to life.

As my main distribution system, I picked Substack (also not without the flows, but I am trying to ignore their ""feed"" feature). All the posts from the blog will be reposted and distributed there in the form of a newsletter. I am also planning to occasionally do photo dumps, making my own photo feed, since IG failed to do so.

\--

Doesn't matter if you’re a creator or a consumer. If you've been thinking about making this switch for a while, it's time to do so. Join the journey of making the Internet a nice place to be again.

P.S. Thank you so much to this sub for making me think about this more and more, and finally pulling the plug. This is my favorite subreddit.",4,1764429664.0,digitalminimalism,2,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Hello it's been a while since the last time i posted on Reddit but the last time was very helpfull so.

My name is Patcheko, i'm 22 years old and i'm a cinema student living in France. Here is the story behind this illustration



When I was in high school, I wasn’t interested in women at all. I was probably depressed (I probably still am, I’m thinking of getting a diagnosis soon). I hated school and skipped classes a lot. The only thing I cared about was my Xbox. I repeated my first year of high school and failed my final exam. When I left school, I decided to start getting interested in girls because before that, I thought it would “just happen” on its own, but after five years with nobody ever showing romantic interest in me, I figured I might need to force fate a little.

I tried something with a girl in my class, it went badly, and I later learned she was a lesbian. After failing my exam, I didn’t want to redo the year, so I told my mom I wanted to take a year for myself—she obviously took it really badly. This was in 2023. During that year, I was constantly reminded every single day that I was a loser, that I had failed school, and that I was useless in the house. So I started locking myself in my room, and my days became just hanging out on my Discord server and playing Valorant.

Around May, a girl joined the server with her best friend. She was really determined to make friends and get along with everyone. Obviously, my friends didn’t see her that way, so most of them tried to shoot their shot. I didn’t interact much with her because I didn’t believe in online love and didn’t want to be the kind of admin who hits on girls who join the server.

One day, a friend insisted she join the voice chat, so she did. My friend—let’s call him Harry—eventually went to sleep, and she and I ended up talking all night, and the nights after that too. One morning after an all-nighter, she told me that most of my friends were being ambiguous with her, with screenshots to prove it. Nothing problematic, just cringe messages from guys who were starving. It made me laugh.

After that we became closer because I was the only one she felt comfortable with since I wasn’t interested in her. She told me she had also dropped out of school, that her family treated her terribly, and that she drowned her sadness in Valorant too. My “friends” started questioning how much time we spent together. They were jealous because they liked her, without knowing I had the screenshots of their conversations. At first the teasing was funny, but it became increasingly cringe and annoying.

To mess with them, we made matching profile pictures: Miles Morales for me and Spider-Gwen for her (I am literally Spider-Man btw). They took it horribly, and one of them even texted her saying he was jealous.

Months went by. We’d be on calls for up to 25 hours sometimes. I spent more time with her than anyone else—she had become my best friend. She said I was her third favorite human, after her brother and her best friend. My “friends,” seeing that, became worse and worse. They made sexual jokes about us and called me a “BDG”—basically a guy who changes his behavior and does anything for women’s attention. They claimed i spent more time than usual in voice chat, which wasn’t true. I was unemployed at the time, so I was always in call even before meeting her.

She was really affectionate with me. She said I was the perfect man and one of her favorite humans. She once cried because she sent me a picture of her cat to start a conversation, but I was exhausted after an all-nighter and coming home from a birthday party, so I just liked the message, and she thought I didn’t want to talk. One day, when she saw I was feeling down, she wrote a whole paragraph listing everything she appreciated about me, then she said it out loud in voice chat—I don’t even remember why.

Harry, when he heard about it, went into her DMs insisting she write him a paragraph too. She eventually gave in because she wanted to get along with everyone. Did I mention Harry had been in a relationship for a year at that point?

And there were other weird behaviors like that. One guy even asked her to tell him about her sex life after learning she and I had talked about sex briefly.

She eventually didn’t want to go on my server’s voice chat anymore, and I couldn’t stand my “friends.” She begged me not to confront them because she didn’t want drama. So she and I started calling privately.

One day she told me we had been calling a long time and that I should go hang out with my friends, then suddenly hung up. It happened two or three times. Eventually I asked what was going on. She said it was nothing, but I insisted until she admitted that Harry had messaged her saying he was tired of us always being in private calls and that he “couldn’t voice chat with me anymore because she was hogging me.”

She begged me not to do anything, but it made me really angry. We’d been friends for months at that point. Then she left for Portugal with her family. She hated her family, and her phone plan didn’t work there. The house was in the countryside, so she could only talk to me when she went into town and connected to public Wi-Fi. She cried about it, so to make her feel better, I gave her my number.

It was during that period—while she was on vacation—that I developed feelings for her. I told one of my only friends who had never acted weird about her. He told me he once asked her if, had we been in the same city, she would have wanted something to happen between us. According to him, she answered that I wouldn’t have wanted it. So he told her he didn’t care about my answer and wanted to know her answer. She kept saying I wouldn’t have wanted it, without saying yes or no.

One day I found the courage to tell her, and she said she didn’t feel the same. She gave me a bunch of excuses—saying she wasn’t my type (I had told her I loved everyone but especially Black women), that we lived too far apart (it was only a three-hour bus ride), that her family was racist, etc.

She started crying and apologizing over and over, and I told her she didn’t need to apologize for not feeling the same. She replied, “You think I don’t feel anything for you?” I clarified that I meant romantic feelings, and she went silent before saying “whatever.” I still think about that moment today.

I told her we needed some distance, and she cried saying she didn’t want to drift apart. I said it would happen sooner or later and that if she ever got into a relationship, I wouldn’t be able to stay. She said that if she ever got a boyfriend and I stopped talking to her, she would break up with him.

After that, things became weird. A few weeks later she started ghosting me, then coming back months later, then ghosting again. At the end of April 2024 she came back, then ghosted again. I couldn’t take it anymore. One night I couldn’t stop thinking about her. I drew a portrait of her face. She had often asked me to draw her, but I always told her she had to commission me. When I looked at the drawing, I wanted to give it to her. But I didn’t want it to look like I was trying to guilt-trip her, so I thought I’d call her to clear things up.

A few days later I finally found the courage, but my friends, my nephews and nieces, and all my siblings were at home. So I went to the park downstairs. I tried calling her but she didn’t answer. She eventually texted saying she preferred to talk by text. I told her she usually picked and chose which messages to answer, so I’d rather talk out loud, adding that I wasn’t angry, I just wanted a conversation. After two hours she turned on airplane mode. I went back home wanting to cry, but with everyone around, I held it in.

Ten minutes later my mom called me into the living room and told me my grandfather had passed away. I broke down crying in front of everyone—my little brothers, my nephews, my friends—crying like a baby. The stress triggered a painful crisis and I had to go to the ER. I spent my birthday in the hospital.

We didn’t talk for months, and in December 2024 she came back like nothing had happened. I crashed. I told her how much I suffered and how much I loved her, and begged her to explain why she behaved like that. She told me that a few weeks after we met, she realized she was obsessed with me and only wanted to spend time with me. All her exes had cheated on her, and her parents are terrible examples of a couple. She doesn’t believe in love—she thinks relationships always end—so she kept reminding me out loud that we were friends and that it was platonic, even though I wasn’t interested romantically at the time. She said all those reminders and boundaries were for herself, to kill her feelings before they grew.

She told me, “Romantic relationships are temporary, and I wanted you with me forever.” She said she was scared. Usually, when she rejects a guy, she doesn’t feel guilty because they don’t take the time to know her—they just idealize her. They only love the parts she shows. But I saw her in every state—happy, sad, angry, tired, depressed…

When I told her “I love you,” she stared at her phone and felt something in her chest. She knew I was different, that I loved her completely. It was the first time a man told her he loved her and she believed it. She thinks she’s hard and exhausting to love. But I’ve never felt as loved as when I was her friend, even in the two relationships I had since.

She distanced herself, and I accepted that whenever she reappeared it was temporary. My two relationships after her lasted 3 and 6 months (including the flirt phase). Today I’m not really in love with her anymore, but there’s a buried feeling inside me, like a last possibility my heart refuses to kill, ready to come back to life if she ever gave me the slightest hint that something could happen.

I know I deserve better now, and I hope I find better. But she’s part of me no matter what. I think of her every time I see my coworkers drink coffee because it’s her favorite drink, or when I see Gwen Stacy (I’m a huge comics fan, especially Spider-Man). I used to keep the same profile pictures for years, but now I change them all the time because when we had matching pfp’s, she always wanted to change them. It was always Miles and Gwen, just a different picture each time. I can’t play Valorant anymore because I associate the game with her, just like I associate Gwen with her.

Sometimes I feel like giving up on love, but she showed me how good it feels to be the center of someone’s world, and I would give anything to feel that again.

I’m Swiss, born and raised near Zurich, and I’m currently working as an IT consultant.

Lately I’ve been playing with the thought of changing careers. Even though a coffee shop would be a real passion project for me, I also need to seriously consider the financial side and whether staying in an office job might be the better choice long term.

My dream would be to move into gastronomy and open a coffee shop – maybe even a few more later on – focused mainly on good coffee and simple food like snacks and sandwiches. I’m thinking of something in the style of places like Draft Coffee, Amiamo Caffee or Sacchi Bar.

I know that the restaurant business in general can be very hard and risky. Maybe I’m getting this wrong and it’s not really something you can measure clearly in numbers, but I’m wondering: is it usually a constant financial struggle, or can it also go relatively smoothly if it’s done right?

Does anyone have an idea of what a coffee shop in a bigger city like Zurich, Basel, or maybe Baden (AG) can roughly earn (revenue and/or profit)? Any ballpark figures or personal experiences would br super interesting.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I always stress to them about tired and sleepy driving.,"Fortunately, everyone survived and made it out with scrapes and bruises. The driver fell asleep at the wheel and hit a cattle guard on the ranch while driving to the location. He hit it, flipped, and rolled it. They say he hit it going anywhere from 25 mph to 35 mph; the speed limit is 25 mph on the ranch.

One of the things I always stress to the guys is about tired and sleepy driving. They have to get up at 3:30 a.m. just to make it to the location at 5:30 a.m. I'm always telling them if they're sleepy, tell the guy next to them, or stop before they get on the ranch and buy coffee or an energy drink to wake up, or stop and do jumping jacks, hell have a slapping contest with another guy for all I care. But the driver needs to be alert and on his toes at all times. If they're late, they're late, as long as they get there safely. We told them before that a nearby location is the man camp where we stay, and they're more than welcome to sleep there at the trailer.

I always get a snicker when I talk to them about that, I just hope that opens there eyes to what I'm talking about. Safety is not just on location for them, its also for when they're driving back and forth from location too.

When we first started dating he didn’t do any of these things until I told him that I’m not going to accept that and he changed. But now everything is back to how it was. I understand that he has no job but all of these things can be done without having money. Gift receiving is my love language and all I want is a coffee, favorite snack or a smalll figurine. I’ve told him multiple times that I don’t feel like we are dating because of no effort and he just cried about says he’s sorry and then continues to just not do anything.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Iowa State Cyclones vs. Oklahoma State Cowboys: A Football Fiasco with a Silver Lining**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for a tale of two teams: the Iowa State Cyclones, who’ve got more consistency than a microwave, and the Oklahoma State Cowboys, who’ve stumbled through the season like a toddler in a tackle football league. Let’s break down why this Saturday’s clash is a foregone conclusion—and why it’s time for the Cowboys to start practicing their ceremonial surrender.

**Parsing the Odds: Why Iowa State Isn’t Just a Favorite—They’re a Foregone Conclusion**  
The numbers don’t lie, and in this case, they’re screaming. Iowa State (-13.5) is listed at decimal odds as low as 1.14, implying bookmakers think they’ll win \~87% of the time. For context, that’s the confidence level of a mathematician betting on 2+2=4. Meanwhile, Oklahoma State (+13.5) sits at a laughable 5.1-5.8, translating to a 14-17% chance. If this were a coin flip, the Cowboys’ side would be heavier than a Thanksgiving turkey.

Statistically, Iowa State’s edge is as wide as a Texas highway. They average 28.1 PPG, while Oklahoma State’s offense sputters to 14.3 PPG—less than half the national average. The Cowboys’ defense? A sieve that’d make a colander blush, allowing 424.9 yards per game. Iowa State’s offense, meanwhile, should feast like a food truck at a buffet. QB Rocco Becht (2,471 yards, 15 TDs) and RB Carson Hansen (841 yards) are the culinary masters of this spread.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Struggles, and Why the Cowboys Should Pack a Towel**  
Oklahoma State’s recent loss to UCF (17-14) was less a football game and more a masterclass in futility. Their rushing attack averages 126.6 yards per game—slower than a sloth on a coffee break. QB Zane Flores, who’s thrown for just 161 yards per game, looks like he’s playing “Golf Clash” compared to Iowa State’s offensive rhythm.

1p9qzq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lelit/comments/1p9qzq8/best_lubricant_for_group_e61_or_lelit_l58e/,Best lubricant for group E61 (or LELIT L58E),"When it comes to maintaining a E61 group (or like), I found most instructions and videos refers to MOLYKOTE 111 for lubrication. However the technical documentation & parts catalogue for the LELIT MaraX is referring to MOLYKOTE G-1502 for all gaskets and also for the cam/shaft.

I made a (not expert) review of both lubricant below but here is my short conclusion:

>It seems both are appropriate for coffee machine application. 111 seems to provide even better performances specifically for water resistance and temperature range however G-1502 seems to be specifically designed for food applications.

Open questions

* I have the filling that 111 seems to be more widely used for our beloved coffee machine, what are the most obvious reasons?
* Are there anyone here using G-1502?
* Anyone has any input in terms of price or ease to procure in small batches?

# Product pages:

* [MOLYKOTE 111](https://www.dupont.com/products/molykote-111-compound.html)
* [MOLYKOTE G-1502](https://www.dupont.com/products/molykote-g-1502-fm-synthetic-bearing-and-gear-grease.html)

# Food compatibility:

* MOLYKOTE G-1502 is clearly referred by to manufacturer as *""Food grade synthetic bearing & gear grease""* and seems to be specifically dedicated to food machinery.
* MOLYKOTE 111 is referred to as *""Valve lubricant and sealant""* and seems to be specifically appropriate for gaskets and also confirmed compatible with food application.

# Temperature:

* MOLYKOTE G-1502 has a temperature range from -40°C to 149°C.
* MOLYKOTE 111 range is -40°C to 204°C.

G-1502 has the lowest max temperature but I think 149°C is already enough in a coffee machine steam application?

# Water resistance:

* MOLYKOTE G-1502 is said to have a *""good""* water resistance
* MOLYKOTE 111 is said *""excellent""* water resistance.

Not sure if this is just wording or if any real difference. Maybe there is a more measurable specification for this property.

Dupont website mentions:

>**Water Resistance**  
How a grease behaves in the presence of water can be an important factor when selecting the correct grease for your application. While lubricants generally are not water-soluble, prolonged water contact can deteriorate lubricant performance.  
MOLYKOTE^(®) offers specialty lubricant greases formulated with a variety of tackifiers to improve the lubricant's ability to stay in place and resist water washout and wash-off.

 I am guessing tackifiers is more or less same as thickener, if yes we should probably look at thickener used for each:

* MOLYKOTE G-1502 uses *""Aluminum Complex""* thickener.
* MOLYKOTE 111 uses *""Silica""* as thickener.

After a little research, it seems silica (MOLYKOTE 111) thickener is superior for water exposure because of water repellent properties which confirms the wording good vs excellent.",2,1764428420.0,Lelit,1,1.0,False

1p9qwro,https://i.redd.it/3jn7xhoxm74g1.jpeg,I Won't Make The Same Mistakes: Do you know where I can read this for free??,"In my previous life, Corbin Hatfield's beloved first love died because of me. Heartbroken, he pretended to marry me for the family's benefit and then used every means possible to drive my family into bankruptcy.
He tormented me until I suffered from severe depression, driving me to despair and ultimately to jump from a building.
In the moment before my death, Corbin stood coldly in front of me, covering my eyes with his hand.
""Aubrey, if you meet Mel and me in your next life, remember to stay away from us.""
When I opened my eyes again, I had returned to seven years ago, on the school path I took every day.
In the distance, Corbin and Melanie Calhoun were walking towards me.
Melanie spotted me first, happily waving in my direction.
""Aubrey! We're over here!""
My dazed mind was instantly jolted into panic. I reacted as if I'd seen ghosts, violently throwing my backpack at them before turning and sprinting away!
""Aubrey! Class is about to start! Where are you going?""
Ignoring my classmate's shouts, I ran alone against the current of students in uniforms.
The wind carried the sunlight with it, slipping quietly through me over and over.
It was wonderful!
Being alive was wonderful!
The heavy burden I shouldered in my previous life was gone.
Now, I was a seventeen-year-old Aubrielle Cooper.
Healthy, lively, bright.
The Cooper and Hatfield families had been close for generations. Corbin was a year older than me and had always been particularly doting on me since childhood.
From a piece of candy in early childhood, to princess dresses in our youth, to the sapphire necklace on my sixteenth birthday, his kindness filled a full third of my life.
Many girls liked him, but I was the only one by his side.
He was like an older brother to me, and also someone I had quietly begun to love.
Everything changed during the school's freshman sports meeting when I suddenly fainted, and it was Melanie who took me to the infirmary.
From then on, there was a Melanie between Corbin and me.
They shared similar hobbies, were both outstanding in character and academics, and always had endless things to talk about when they were together.
I gradually became the invisible one in the trio.
***
In my previous life, the story of Melanie being assaulted by her stepfather spread throughout the entire campus.
Before she jumped off, her hair was disheveled, and she stared at me with fierce hatred.
""Aubrielle, remember this! You are the one who killed me!""
Then she resolutely jumped, giving no one any time to pull her back.
Not even... giving me a chance to explain.
Corbin went mad after seeing the note she left.
He gripped my shoulders tightly, his crimson eyes burning with a hatred that terrified me.
""Aubrielle! Why? Why would you do this?
""You were the only one who knew about this!""
""I...""
My throat tightened repeatedly. I barely managed to endure the sharp pain in my shoulders and force out a few fragmented words.
""I didn't.
""It wasn't me.""
But no one believed me.
Melanie's emphatic accusation before her death had already branded me as the murderer.
Any defense seemed feeble against the victim's direct accusation.
Consequently, I faced unprecedented bullying and isolation.
Everyone saw me as a murderer. Every classmate looked at me with resentment in their eyes.
Especially Corbin.
Four years later, the Hatfield family proposed an alliance marriage with my family. He agreed.
Chapter 2
He seemed to have forgotten all about Melanie, reverting to his incredibly kind and attentive self towards me.
I thought Corbin had finally chosen to believe me.
He ruffled my hair gently, just like he had all our lives, his eyes soft and warm.
""Aubrey, let's get married.""
The Corbin from my memories was always gentle and doting. I thought the old him had returned.
It lasted until the Cooper Group's secrets fell into Corbin's hands. My family's businesses were ruthlessly suppressed by him. My parents were driven out of Birmingham, and I was confined to the house.
Hostility and emotional neglect filled every moment of my existence.
Corbin stopped pretending. The way he looked at me was icy and distant.
""Aubrey, you should taste every bit of the suffering Melanie endured.
""Aubrey, why don't you just die? If you died, I might... be able to forgive you.""
As Corbin wished, seven years later, Aubrielle also jumped from a building, as despairing as Melanie had been.
***
I stood dazedly on the street, the school's class bell still echoing in my ears.
The agony of my skull fracturing, my soul detaching, and Corbin's cold, heartless whisper before my death finally began to recede from my mind.
""Aubrey, if you meet Mel and me in your next life, remember to stay away from us.""
I let out a long, slow breath.
In this life, I will definitely stay far, far away from Corbin and Melanie.
I turned and quickly ran towards home.
""Aubrey? Shouldn't you be in class right now?""
Just inside the door, my mother was sitting in the backyard, leisurely sipping coffee. She was surprised to see me burst in suddenly.
With wet eyes, I rushed forward and hugged her tightly.
In my previous life, their life's work was destroyed. They were driven out of Birmingham by Corbin, whom they had watched grow up, and I didn't even get to see them one last time before I died.
""You're still so clingy with your mom even at this age? What will you do when you get married?""
Above me, my mother's gentle complaint sounded softly.
But I shivered involuntarily at the mention of ""getting married"".
I held her even tighter.
""I won't get married. I'm not going anywhere. I'll stay home, being with you and Dad, relying on our family company, being a trust-fund kid who just lazes around...""
My mother pretended to be helpless, but her smile deepened.
""Is that so? Well, I guess we'll just have to let you, our little freeloader, live off us for life then.""
***
After spending the evening settling my emotions, the next day, I started attending school normally.
The driver dropped me off at the school gate.
As I got out of the car, I glimpsed Corbin and Melanie standing and chatting at the intersection not far away.
That was our usual meeting spot. They were waiting for me.
Terrified of being spotted by them, I quickly ducked my head, grabbed my backpack, and rushed into the school.
On the school path, during our walks as a trio, my eyes were on Corbin, but Corbin's eyes were always on Melanie.
This unrequited love should have ended long ago.
Yet, in my youthful ignorance, I used to secretly rejoice that I could catch one more glimpse of Corbin on that little path.
***
After school, I dawdled as I left. Corbin and Melanie were waiting at the school gate.
There was no avoiding them. I had no choice but to steel myself and walk out.
Chapter 3
Melanie didn't ask me why I had run away at the sight of them yesterday. Instead, she linked her arm with mine as intimately as ever.
""Aubrey! We waited for you for a long time at the intersection today. Why didn't you come?""
I struggled to hold back, but ultimately couldn't stop myself from subtly withdrawing my hand from hers.
Melanie's expression stiffened briefly but quickly returned to normal.
""It's my birthday today, Aubrey. Don't you plan to celebrate with me?""
My heart gave a sudden tremble.
In my previous life, it was on the night of Melanie's birthday that she got drunk. With red-rimmed eyes, we confided in each other, and she unintentionally told me about being assaulted by her stepfather when she was younger.
This time, how could I dare to listen to her secrets again?
I didn't dare look at Corbin standing beside her, only keeping my head down and making up my excuse.
""I... I have something at home. I can't go. Happy Birthday.""
After saying that, I ignored Melanie's instantly reddening eyes, turned, and walked away quickly.
Suddenly, hurried footsteps sounded behind me.
""Aubrielle.""
It was Corbin.
My heart lurched in fear, and I walked even faster with my head down.
Corbin caught up with me in just a few strides, blocking my path ahead. His shadow instantly fell over me.
""What are you running from?""
Finally, for the first time, I raised my head to look at Corbin, who had just turned eighteen.
He wore the familiar school uniform, his facial features clear and sharp. But the deep, detached look in his eyes was identical to the Corbin from my previous life.
Suddenly, I realized that an eighteen-year-old Corbin wouldn't look at me with such an expression.
I panicked abruptly, instinctively stepping back a few paces, nearly losing my balance.
Corbin, however, stepped on my shadow as he advanced step by step.
""Aubrielle, you seem... afraid of me?""
The next moment, Corbin's expression suddenly softened. He reached out and ruffled my hair, just like he used to.
""Aubrey, are you feeling unwell? Why are you hiding from Mel and me?
""It's Mel's birthday today. She'll be very sad if you don't come. Let's go celebrate together, okay?""
Corbin was smiling, but I sensed a probing undertone.
It made sense. Since yesterday, my behavior had been rare. I avoided them whenever possible, and I didn't act as eagerly towards Corbin as I had in my past life.
If... Corbin wasn't the eighteen-year-old Corbin either, he would surely suspect whether I was still the seventeen-year-old Aubrey.
After three years of marriage, any feelings I had for Corbin had long vanished.
Now, I felt both hatred and fear towards him.
""I... I...""
I forced a smile, but Corbin had already taken the initiative. He spoke to Jay, who was waiting to pick me up by the roadside, ""Jay, it's a classmate's birthday today. I'll take Aubrey to celebrate and then see her home later.""
Jay, aware of the close relationship between the Cooper and Hatfield families, smiled, nodded, and drove away.
I had no choice but to trail silently behind the two of them.
In the past, during our walks as a trio, I often watched, my heart aching with sorrow, as Corbin and Melanie chatted and laughed. They bonded naturally.
But now, I just looked at them indifferently, my heart completely calm.
I was even planning what excuse I could use to leave early.
***
The night before I jumped to my death was the anniversary of Melanie's death.
Corbin, who was always out enjoying himself, came home for once. He smiled gently and delivered words that pierced my heart.

Chapter 4
""Aubrey, do you remember that time in your senior year when you were cornered in the back alley? I happened to be back at school that day. I stood at the mouth of the alley and watched you for a long time.""
The floor-to-ceiling window reflected my instantly pale face.
That day... I would never forget it.
Some students forced me into the school's back alley. They called me a murderer, took turns slapping me, tore my books to shreds, and scattered them all over the alley.
Finally, they forced me to kneel and say ""I was wrong, Ms. Calhoun"" one hundred times.
I numbly complied with their demands because only then would the bullying end.
On graduation day, I thought it was finally over. I tried my best to forget those humiliating memories and sealed away everything related to Melanie.
I thought I could start over.
But Corbin later told me he had been there all along, on that deeply humiliating day.
That Corbin, who had held my hand since childhood and accompanied me like an older brother as I grew up, had stood somewhere, watching indifferently as I was bullied, hit, insulted, and forced to kneel and apologize.
Corbin leaned close to my ear and continued speaking calmly.
""Oh, and Aubrey, your mother is sick now but has no money for treatment. Your father, at his age, has to work on construction sites. He hurt his back and struggles every day.
""All of this is your fault. They could have lived a life of ease and comfort, but now they have to atone for your mistakes.""
I saw my own vacant pupils in the reflection grow utterly lifeless with Corbin's words.
So, as long as I, the ""sinner"", remained alive in this world, as long as Corbin remained in my life, nothing could ever truly end.
I could only atone for my ""sins"" through death, to break free by dying.
On the way, Corbin called the manager of his family's club and reserved a private room not open to the public.
Hearing his calm, authoritative tone as he made the arrangements suddenly reminded me of the Corbin after our marriage.
In my memory, such a Corbin only emerged after he inherited the family business.
Had he... also been reborn?
The thought made me nervous.
No matter what, I couldn't let Corbin detect anything unusual about me.
If Corbin had indeed been reborn and if the events of the previous life repeated themselves, I would still be the ""sole culprit"" who harmed Melanie in his eyes.
After all... I was the only one who knew Melanie's secret.
In the private room, Melanie shyly picked a love song and invited Corbin to sing a duet with her.
Their classmates started teasing and egging them on.
In their eyes, the noble, polite Corbin and the beautiful, resilient Melanie were destined to be together eventually.
I watched it all calmly, finding the entire birthday celebration tedious and drawn-out.
Suddenly, the door to the room opened, and a woman dressed like a socialite appeared at the entrance.
""Corb?""
It was Corbin's mother.
Dressed in an haute couture suit, she looked commanding. The lively noise in the room ceased abruptly with her arrival.
When her gaze swept over Melanie, who was sitting very close to Corbin, she frowned slightly. But when she looked at me sitting in the corner, her face instantly broke into a smile.
Chapter 5
""Aubrey, I was wondering why my Corb went through so much trouble to reserve this room at the club today. So it was because you wanted to come and have some fun.""
I had no choice but to stand up awkwardly.
""Catherine, actually, it's...""
""It's fine,"" Catherine smiled at me, her eyes full of affection. ""I was supposed to entertain clients here today. I didn't expect Corb to take my room. I thought it was for some cheeky little girl.
""As long as it's you who wants to come, any room in this club is yours.""
As soon as she said this, the atmosphere in the room instantly turned awkward. Corbin looked displeased, while Melanie only managed to maintain her look of embarrassment for a few seconds before restoring her smile.
I wanted to say something more, but Catherine cut me off directly.
""Oh, and Aubrey, remember to come over with your parents this weekend. I've hired a new chef who's especially skilled at making your favorite dishes.""
""I..."" The words stuck in my throat, but I couldn't think of any way to refuse, so I just said stiffly, ""Thank you, Catherine.""
Catherine left satisfied, but I began to feel restless and uneasy.
Fortunately, no one dwelled too much, and before long, the noise and chatter started up again.
Melanie, however, was clearly somewhat dispirited. After a few drinks, she came over, linked arms with me intimately, and complained.
""Aubrey, Corbin gave me a custom-made necklace today. It's too expensive. I tried to refuse, but he said it was just a normal gift.
""What can I do with him? Was he always this 'normal' for your birthdays in the past?""
I paused. The extra seven years finally allowed me to understand Melanie's implication this time.
She was trying to find out if Corbin treated her differently.
I smiled and said, ""No.""
""Really?""
Melanie's eyes instantly held a trace of delight, mixed with a hint of suspicion.
""Aubrey, you seem a bit unhappy today. Is it because... Corbin only gave me a necklace?""
I froze for a moment, suddenly realizing that perhaps the feelings I thought I had hidden so well in my previous life had been noticed by Melanie all along.
""No.""
I quickly took Melanie's hand and spoke sincerely, ""Ms. Calhoun, I'm genuinely happy for you that Corb treats you well. I hope... You both will always be well.""
Amidst the noise, Corbin suddenly glanced in our direction.
Melanie was clearly preparing to confide more in me, but right now, I just wanted to get away from anywhere she and Corbin were. I pretended to have severe stomach cramps and fled the club as if escaping.
***
Away from the place where Corbin was, I felt a sense of relief, and my steps instantly lightened.
I was trying to hail a taxi by the roadside when Corbin appeared out of nowhere behind me.
""Aubrey, didn't you just say... You weren't feeling well?""
I shuddered all over, instantly flustered and stammering, ""I... I started feeling a bit better after I came out.""
Corbin's looming figure was intensely oppressive, his gaze gloomy and probing.
""But Aubrey, I recall that you only started calling her... Ms. Calhoun... after she died.""",2,1764428207.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

“I thought several times this year while reading a particularly good book about what amazing bargains books still are — for $20 or $30 bucks, and often even just $5 or $10 used — you can dive into an entire world created by someone else over years of work, research, and creativity. You can have decades, centuries, and even millennia of knowledge, information, discoveries, and history summarized and explained for you by some of the smartest people in the world for the price of a couple cups of coffee. You can spend an entire weekend (or a few nights or even a couple weeks) soaking and subsuming yourself into worlds that you couldn’t have imagined before you picked up the book, getting to know characters and human experiences more intimately than you will ever know most of the people you interact with in real life. You can sit on your couch, or in your favorite chair, or an airplane or bus seat, and be transported vividly to some of the most dramatic moments and turning points of humanity. And then, afterward, you’ll never be the same person you were before reading. What better bargain of self-improvement, happiness, and knowledge is there in the world?”

The capital of Austria is renowned across the globe for its classical music, grand architecture, coffee houses, and Sachertorte. However, beneath the imperial façades and waltzes lies a surprisingly vibrant **poker scene** that attracts locals, tourists, and pros from across Europe and beyond it.

And while Austria’s strict gambling laws create a unique environment, with a state monopoly on “big games” and a distinction between player-vs-player poker and house-banked variants, Vienna remains one of the Old Continent’s underrated poker hubs.

# The Legal Framework: Why Poker in Vienna is “Different”

Speaking in legal terms, Austria classifies poker as a game of chance, not skill, which means it falls under the federal Gambling Act (Glücksspielgesetz). Casinos Austria AG holds the monopoly on most forms of gambling, including traditional casino poker variants (like Ultimate Texas Hold’em) played against the house.

True player-vs-player poker (cash games and tournaments where players compete against each other) was historically reserved in dedicated “card casinos” under provincial licenses. However, after legal battles and EU pressure, many of these casinos either transitioned or closed down completely.

As of 2025, there are only two primary venues for classic [Texas No-Limit Hold’em](https://www.pokerlistings.com/poker-rules/texas-holdem-poker) (NLHE) and [Pot-Limit Omaha](https://www.pokerlistings.com/poker-rules/pot-limit-omaha) (PLO), one in the very heart of the city and the other about 20 minutes away in beautiful Baden.

# Key Milestones in Vienna’s Poker Scene

* **Early 2000s**: The European poker boom reaches Austria. Vienna emerges as a hub for European pros and cash games due to relatively lenient laws (private games are allowed if no house profit is taken).
* **2005**: Vienna hosts an event on the inaugural season of the [**European Poker Tour**](https://www.pokerlistings.com/poker-tournaments/european-poker-tour) **(EPT)** at the Concord Card Casino, attracting 297 players, one of the largest fields that year.
* **2010–2014**: EPT Vienna returns multiple times (e.g., Season 7 in 2010 with 587 players and a €2.9M prize pool; final edition in 2014). These events put Vienna on the international tournament map.

# Concord Card Casino: The Former Poker Hub of Vienna

The **Concord Card Casino (CCC)** group, often referred to as Concord Card Club, was founded in **1993** in Vienna (specifically the Simmering district) by Austrian entrepreneur **Peter Zanoni**. It began as a pioneering poker venue in Austria at a time when organized poker was still emerging in Europe, with the Vienna-Simmering location serving as the group’s headquarters. The casino operated 24/7 and focused exclusively on poker (cash games and tournaments), distinguishing itself from traditional casinos by not offering slot machines.

Under Zanoni’s leadership, CCC rapidly expanded throughout Austria, growing to **12 locations** and becoming **Europe’s largest live poker provider** by the 2010s. It gained a reputation for high-quality tournaments (including major events like the European Poker Tour stops), celebrity visitors, and professional operations.

In 2012, the group acquired the well-known **Montesino Casino** in Vienna, further solidifying its dominance. The Concord card room was great for me during the 2000 to 2004 period as I played a lot with the famous Tony G, Jean Robert Belland, and Jeff Lisandro in some very good 2 to 7 triple draw. At that time, the place also had a daily 2-2 blind PLO that played much bigger.

# Top Poker Venues in Vienna Today

**Unfortunately,** due to legal battles with the government, the Concord and Montesino were forced to close, **and now poker is played in private games or the two venues i will mention here.**

1. **Casino Vienna**: This is the flagship of Casinos Austria glamorous, central, and tourist-friendly setup. Most days in this location, visitors and locals come and play Texas Hold’em and Omaha at low and middle limits. The games tend to start around 4pm and go on until 4 am with the casino closing at 5am.The days that I played there were several games going.
2. **Casino Baden**: One of Europe’s largest, most beautiful, and most elegant casinos, located in the historic spa town of Baden, about 26 km (16 miles) south of Vienna, Austria. Housed in a protected 19th-century building (originally a spa hotel from 1886, extensively renovated in the 1990s), it combines classic grandeur with modern gaming.

# A Bit More About Casino Baden

Set right next to the scenic Kurpark (spa park), it’s a popular evening destination for Viennese and tourists alike, with a smart-casual dress code and entry from age 18 (photo ID required). Often called “the jewel” among Austrian casinos.

You’ll find a selection of Texas Hold’em and Omaha games here, which can draw in pretty big fields, especially during the Casinos Austria CAPT Baden that is currently underway. These two variants provide both the pros and the rookies a great opportunity to play the game with some of the most breathtaking views in the world.

Getting to Vienna or Baden is relatively simple and affordable from just about anywhere in Europe. If you’re a European player, just search through a few Ryanair or Wizz Air flights and you could be playing no later than tomorrow. However, keep in mind that accommodation in Vienna, and especially Baden, aren’t on the cheaper side.

# A Few Final Tourist Recommendations from Me

Austria has much more to offer than just poker. So, if you’re visiting this central European country, make sure to get out of the casino at least for a day and visit at least some of these sights:

* **Schönbrunn Palace & Gardens**: The UNESCO-listed former summer residence of the Habsburgs, with opulent rooms, vast gardens, a maze, and the world’s oldest zoo. In winter, the Christmas market in front lights up the palace courtyard (open Nov 6, 2025–Jan 6, 2026). Book tickets online to skip lines.
* **Hofburg Palace**: The massive winter residence of the Habsburgs in the city center. Explore the Imperial Apartments, Sisi Museum (dedicated to Empress Elisabeth), and the Silver Collection. Nearby, catch the famous Lipizzaner horses at the Spanish Riding School (morning exercises or performances).
* **St. Stephen’s Cathedral (Stephansdom)**: Vienna’s Gothic centerpiece with its colorful tiled roof. Climb the South Tower for panoramic views or descend into the catacombs. The surrounding Stephansplatz hosts a charming Christmas market.
* **Belvedere Palace**: Two stunning Baroque palaces housing Austrian art, including Gustav Klimt’s *The Kiss*. The gardens are lovely even in winter, and the Christmas village in front runs Nov 14–Dec 31, 2025.
* Good luck at the tables and see you in the winners circle!

1p9qst0,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1p9qst0/happiness_is_a_productivity_booster_a_simple/,Happiness Is a Productivity Booster: A Simple 5-Minute Routine That Actually Works,"We talk a lot about apps, systems, and hacks—but one of the most underrated productivity tools is something most of us ignore:

👉 **Your baseline mood.**  
Not forced positivity. Not pretending everything’s fine.  
Just getting yourself to feel **a tiny bit better** than you do right now.

Because here’s the truth backed by a ton of research:  
**A slightly happier brain is a more productive brain.**  
Better focus, better memory, better problem-solving, better self-control.

And you don’t need a retreat, a vacation, or a perfect life to get there.  
You just need **five minutes**.

Below is a quick routine I started using that consistently boosts my output without feeling like a “routine.”

# 🕐 The 5-Minute Happiness-to-Productivity Routine

# 1. 60-Second Reset

This one is stupidly simple.  
Before opening your laptop:

* Take 5 slow breaths
* Drop your shoulders
* Unclench your jaw
* Loosen your face

When your body relaxes, your brain stops acting like it’s under attack.  
Focus becomes way easier.

# 2. 2-Minute “Things That Don’t Suck” List

Gratitude journaling sounds cringe to a lot of people, so do this instead.

List **three things that don’t suck today**.  
Examples:

* “My coffee was good.”
* “My chair is comfy.”
* “I woke up on time.”

It’s micro-level gratitude.  
It shifts your brain from scanning for problems → scanning for possibilities.

# 3. 90-Second Intention Lock

Write this sentence (yes, literally write it):

**“Today will be a good day if I complete \_\_\_\_\_\_.”**

Just one thing.  
This cuts overwhelm and gives your brain one clear target.  
The moment you fill in that blank, you know your priority.

# 4. 30-Second Environment Tune-Up

Change *one* thing around you:

* Put your phone in another room
* Remove 3 items from your desk
* Open a window
* Turn on a light

One tiny environmental shift = disproportionate productivity gain.

# 🧠 Why This Works (the short version)

Happiness isn’t something you get *after* being productive.  
It’s a **neurochemical head start** that makes productivity easier.

You don’t need to feel incredible.  
You just need to feel **2% better**.  
The compounding effect throughout your work session is huge.

# If you try this today, let me know which part made the biggest difference.

I’m curious whether people feel the boost more from the intention-setting or the physical reset.",1,1764427916.0,productivity,0,1.0,False

Thanks to this review from Tom's Coffee Corner, I've decided to order Magnifica Plus: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-r3\_yLO41As](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-r3_yLO41As)

The most prominent feature of Magnifica plus mentioned in this video was **Doppio+ coffee beans grind time**. He claims that his machine grinds **Doppio+ shots for full 12s**, making one of the largest coffee pucks in superautomatics. This is a big deal for me, as I am used to strong, well extracted espresso shots from the more traditional espresso machines.

I've ordered a black version of magnifica plus with model designation **ECAM 320.60**, as it was about 100 bucks cheaper.

However, in my tests at home, **I couldn't get it to grind the beans for longer than 10.5s for Doppio+**. Then I started to dig deeper, and realized that the machine that was review on his channel was likely **ECAM 322.70**. Both are called ""Magnifica Plus"", but have different model numbers and different colors, and there are some differences in firmware, as it seems like ECAM 322.70 offers a couple more drink recipies.

Now that made me wonder: could it be that the grind time for Doppio+ is configured differently between different Magnifica Plus models? Is it possible that ECAM 322.70 grinds for 12s, while ECAM 320.6x is limited to \~10.5s?",2,1764427668.0,DeLonghi,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **George Mason Patriots vs. James Madison Dukes: A Three-Pointed Clash of Pride (and Spreads)**

**Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem**  
George Mason (-12.5) is a near-unanimous favorite here, with decimal odds of \~1.11 implying a 90% chance to win. James Madison (+12.5) carries a 13-16% implied probability, which is about as likely as me correctly spelling “rebounding statistician” after one cup of coffee. The over/under sits at 142.5 points, and with both teams trading three-pointers like trading cards, the Over seems like a safer bet than a Dukes road trip.

Key stats? George Mason’s rebounding dominance (33.6 RPG, led by Riley Allenspach’s 6.1 RPG) could suffocate James Madison’s offense, which allows opponents to shoot 43.2% from the field. But here’s the twist: JMU makes 10.4 three-pointers per game—3.7 more per contest than George Mason allows. If the Dukes can avoid turning into a human piñata on defense, their sharpshooting could keep this game closer than a locked dorm fridge on a weekday.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Home Cookin’, and Three-Point Shenanigans**  
George Mason’s recent 88-83 loss to Murray State? A mere speed bump for a team that’s 5-0 at home and plays like they’ve got a “Do Not Disturb” sign on their court. Their offense isn’t elite (72.6 PPG, 109th nationally), but their defense—allowing just 63.4 points per game—is the picky eater in a buffet, refusing to let opponents have seconds.

James Madison, meanwhile, is 1-3 on the road, which is about as reliable as a GPS in a thunderstorm. Their last win over Omaha was a 88-77 romp, powered by Justin McBride’s 24-point explosion. But can he replicate that magic against a Patriot defense that’s outscored opponen

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

I just moved and want to use Black Friday as an excuse to finally upgrade my coffee setup.  
For the past three years I’ve been using a Philips 2200 Series super-automatic. It works, but I’m honestly getting tired of it; the coffee is fine, but never *great*. I’d like to start learning how to make better coffee and also play around with milk steaming.

**My situation / needs:**

* I mostly drink espresso, americanos **and cappuccinos**
* I want noticeably better coffee than what my Philips 2200 can produce
* My girlfriend doesn’t drink espresso, but she *does* enjoy an occasional latte
* Milk frothing is important for me
* Ideally the machine can **froth milk automatically**, so my girlfriend can just press a button for a latte (no problem if she has to add the milk manually haha)
* Budget: **€400–€600**
* Location: **Belgium (EU)**

**My questions:**

* What machines would you recommend for someone who wants better espresso but still wants convenience for cappuccinos/lattes?
* Any good Black Friday deals in the €400–€600 range (EU)?
* What type of machine would you choose in this budget?

**TL;DR:**  
Looking for a new coffee machine (budget €400–€600, EU). Want better espresso than my Philips 2200, and good milk frothing for cappuccinos. Girlfriend wants a simple one-button latte. Looking for Black Friday recommendation",3,1764427488.0,BuyItForLife,8,0.8,False

1p9qh7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/northernlion/comments/1p9qh7j/here_is_purpose_of_life/,here is purpose of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",2,1764427052.0,northernlion,3,1.0,False

I’m Alexis, I’m 25, I’m from Arizona. It’s hot and dry, and that’s cool for a while until it sucks for a while and then it’s cool again I guess. I have learned to be a sunscreen connoisseur. I have sunscreens you have never even dreamed of.  

I work part time as a barista at a locally owned coffee shop, 20-25 hours a week usually. I also do some small online work doing graphic design for companies, as well as being legally partially disabled for some health issues I’ve dealt with the majority of my life. Nothing absolutely insane, but I do have a heart condition where I’m supposed to try and keep my heart rate from being in a prolonged elevated state so I have to be very specific about taking jobs. 

I love art, extremely dry humor, brainrot humor (very picky on this one), dry humor, sarcasm. I doodle quite a bit, I love to be outside until I sunburn where I become an indoor recluse for the next month. Absolutely love live music, going to a bar with a friend and drinking 2 drinks and then stopping. 

I’d love to find some people to chat with throughout the day, I know I’ve really done a great job selling myself so far lol. I’m more of a night owl than anything else lately, so there’s fair warning. I definitely prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friendship and conversation, I would rather have 2-3 great friends with invested conversations than 50 with shallow conversations. 

If you 

-are over 18 
-somewhere in North America 
-can handle dry humor and sarcasm over text without getting offended 

Message me!! Send me a small intro, at least your age and where you’re from and how your thanksgiving went! give me something to work with in the conversation, don’t make it impossible on me to drive it forward.

I have been wanting to start for a long time since I heard all the mental health benefits and watch big name podcasts and listened to success stories which motivated me to start. It’s been about 2 months so far. I started at 263 and now I’m 254. Haven’t lost any muscle since I go to the gym everyday. Most days I am not even sure If I am in Keto. On particular days, I noticed I had foul breath-keto breath and other days my sweat would smell fruity or like sweet onion. First thing that happened to me was intense brain fog and irritability like in the first week.

Week 2 to 6 is where my body and mind started changing so quick and I experienced amazing focus, clear mind, amazing sleep(which I was super grateful for since I struggled with sleep for so many years), high libido, and other benefits.

Week 6 is where I started getting brain fog again and irritated easily. I did some research and found out that my body was starving for electrolytes. I use 1 packet of lmnt now and 2 packets on heavy workout days. 

Now it’s week 8 and my sleep is alright, but I don’t feel the urge to sleep around 10 pm anymore. My nervous system is super sensitive so even a little caffeine can keep me awake. Libido has also significantly reduced and dont get morning wood either. I wonder if that is related to no fap because it’s day 32 of no fap for me now.

Im sure I have not even been in ketosis for long periods of time since I would eat high carb foods once in a while. One particular drink that I am struggling to cut is international delight caramel coffee creamer- it’s just so good with my coffee.

The least I go in daily carb in take is 30g. The highest I go is 70g. I have 39% fat and over 60 pounds in lean mass. Yeah Im muscular, but most of is hidden under fat and I would like to continue keto and lose about 35 more pounds minimum. I would love some tips on supplements and other habits that can help me in my keto journey

I have not been able to grieve due to all the bills, accounts, vehicles, phone calls and trying to take care of my 92yo mom. She has some kind of unspecified slowly progressing dementia and paranoia was one of the first symptoms. We finally got her to come home with us (3 hours drive) for Thanksgiving and she has two appts up here next week. 
This morning she says she is going home. Woke me up calling - she lives in another house a couple hundred feet from ours - at 6:00am then hung up on me when I called back. I called again and she ended the call. 
When I went in to check on her, get her coffee and make sure she took her pills she lit into me. Says she is going home and she’ll just die there. She cannot take care of herself, is frail and forgets her medications if someone doesn’t put them in her hand and her water in the other. 
She continued her baseline attack that I am going to hell because I drink alcohol and do not believe in god and I’m going to keep all her money. I only came to see dad when he was in the hospital not when she was in the hospital (story). 
The other thing that really concerns me is she keeps saying she has friends who will take care of her. These are more made up stories but I am afraid she will call someone and they will think they need to come get her or call the police. I know in my heart that this is not my mom and she needs me but the line keeps moving. On a day like today she is completely irrational but other days she seems almost reasonable. If it weren’t for her constantly saying that my dad never loved her, he only loved me and the six girlfriends he had who kept sneaking in and out of the house (including this house here; my H and I just could not tell it wasn’t mom) that is. 
We went over her checking and savings accounts yesterday so I think it wore her out and started her making up new stories. 

I don’t know what to do. She cannot take care of her accounts herself even though she will swear on a bible she can and her eyes and handwriting will get better someday so why would she give me poa?

If I go to court to get poa she will really hate me and I will most likely have to put her in a facility. Despite a few good memory care units close by I know she will not want to see me ever again. 

Before someone recommends a service to care for her she is very opposed to anyone coming in her house and telling her what to do. I am in talks with a service that deals with this disease but how can I set something up if she is determined to leave?",5,1764426142.0,dementia,2,1.0,False

Basically on day one of orientation, I was sitting in the front row and this girl sat next to me and started talking my ear off. Asking me about what I do, what my hobbies are, etc. I guess I misread the social cues, but it felt like she was being flirty. We had one of our classes together and we studied together every day in the coffee shop. One evening I added her on social media and sent her a direct message asking her if she wanted to go get dinner. She said yes but then caveated it by saying she wasn’t looking for anything but wanted to get dinner as friends. I said cool, we had a nice dinner and split the check. 

We kept talking to each other and sending memes back and forth, studying after school etc. We also hung out together as part of a larger group but never alone. I noticed she started getting kinda distant so I stopped going by to ask her to study. One night I saw her in a bar and she clearly didn’t want to see me there, I went up and we talked but it felt super forced and awkward. I sent her a text later that night saying “hey, am I getting on your nerves?” And she sent one back saying something along the lines of “Yeah, you are. I’m sorry if you had feelings but it’s just making me a little uncomfortable.” And then I just responded “that’s cool.” 

We haven’t talked in about a month and I haven’t texted her or anything. Last night after I posted a photo of the Thanksgiving turkey I noticed she unfollowed me on Instagram. 

Am I going to get a Title IX case against me and get tossed out of law school come Monday? I am just really stressed because law school is the one thing I got going for me and I am fucked if I get expelled. 

To be clear, I never made a sexual remark or made any comment on her appearance or anything to do with sex or relationships in her presence. I did make very direct eye contact with her at times because I thought she was cute. Tbh yeah I did have a crush on her but I was also completely fine being friends with her. Should I also be reading into the instagram thing? I would watch her Instagram stories after we stopped talking but she would also watch mine.

Also to be clear I’m not bitter or angry or anything, this was all well within her rights, I guess I’m just anxious. ",0,1764426000.0,LawSchool,14,0.14,False
1p9q2oy,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1p9q2oy/what_do_you_do_when_you_wake_up_too_early/,What do you do when you wake up too early?,"I’ve started doing a more intentional morning routine - it’s not quite as intense as I’m sure some of are you are doing but I like it. 
I wake up and go to the gym (3 days a week for now) then come home, breakfast(egg whites yay!) and coffee, while reading my Bible and journaling for about 30-45 minutes. 
On non-gym days I will do a 10-15 morning stretch or yoga with my kiddos.
But this morning - Saturday, everyone in my family is tired, so I don’t wanna start moving and wake everyone up. So I woke up early and just sat in bed and watched TikTok until I couldn’t stand it and it was late enough, so I could get up. 

So the question is - when you wake up and can’t fall asleep, or any time you are up way before you’re supposed to be awake - how do you spend that time in a non-wasteful way. Bonus points if it is a restful, helpful way to spend those 2-3 hours.

Before you say read - specify fiction or self help or non-fiction and tell me how it helps. I find that self-help too early makes me grumpy and skeptical, can feed into negative self-thought if I interact with it too much and too early. I think because I’m considering how much I do “wrong” and how much I need to change. Fiction is great - I just read too fast, typically a book a day when I like it and I can’t keep that many books around well yet (need to set aside some library time) ",1,1764425969.0,getdisciplined,2,1.0,False

1p9q0ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1p9q0ee/i_dont_belong_to_this_world/,I don’t belong to this world,"Don’t know where else to post this question. I feel extremely alone and it’s not because I’m a loner though sometimes I can be. I’m not depressed at all although I’ve dealt with it before, but I’ve come to discover a way to defeat that beast recently. My main point is that I am not like anybody I’ve ever met or seen before. As much as this may sound like boasting, I really mean it when I say I know I am very different. Everybody I know, including my own family call me weird but not in the sense of hurting my feelings. I’ve always been an empathetic person and when I was young, I’ve been obsessed with Jesus and his love. In middle school I lost my faith but found it again a few years ago which is where this all really rapidly started. I started getting this feeling more and more within me and especially when I do wrong. It’s like a fire within me from The Holy Spirit and he’s hungry for growth but I’m not sure why. It feels like he’s preparing me for something which is why I do what I do now. Years of hard work with David Goggins mindset and although I cannot do as much as him because he really is a freaking machine - I know that eventually I will surpass that mentality. Again, I’m not trying to boast but more explain because anytime I share or let people into my bubble of mindset, they either call me insane or just worry about me. I push myself to extreme pain and it’s growing more and more each day. This fire within me isn’t settling and that makes me stranger everyday. I want self growth more than I want to eat. I need to be in pain to grow and I don’t mean subtle pain but long lasting pain. I need to be majorly uncomfortable everyday and I don’t mean self harm at all. I just started ultra running and will be doing long distance cycling as well as swimming in the future and maybe even some triathlons but even with this, the fire within me doesn’t feel contempt. I view the world in a much different way where people will say to me “wow, you’re so kind and mindful” but even that doesn’t explain it to the fullest. Most times, I stop and admire the room I’m in with the strangers in it. I envision their struggles and their happiness. I look at each individual and know that when I leave this room we may never see each other again. They will continue to live their life and I root for them. There’s so much more I want to write down but It will be so long and I also hate talking about myself because even though I say it’s not boasting and I know I’m not - it still leaves a sour taste on my tongue. This is a lonely path. I’m not asking for help but more of you know anybody that has this mindset or maybe you do. It feels like I’m a complete alien. Which is why I don’t have much close friends because I’m afraid I’ll scare them away or they may think that I’m considered better than them. I’m only freaking 25 as well. I live my life like I’m 70 years old and I freaking love it. People tell me I’m an old soul and everyday I believe I more. lol you should see how I dress everyday and my daily routines because nothing is better than wearing dress shoes with a tucked in long sleeve button down shirt and drinking your morning coffee while watching the sun rise. Again, this is maybe the surface of how I live my life and there’s so much more. If I’m bragging then please call me out. Call me out if I sound stupid or just downright over myself.

1p9pzlp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p9pzlp,Made 11 cups of latte for a home cafe event with the robot,"Pulled 11 shots (without using the spout) consecutively and steamed milk with the ALM Kopi stovetop steamer for 11 cups of latte this morning. Here are a few things that smoothen the robot workflow: 

- weigh out the beans, packed in tubes before hand 
- 2 sets of baskets + filter screens
- puck prep 2 shots and pull back to back before moving on to another 2 
- a big cup for the liquid waste after every shot
- keep the cups warm in a pre heated oven 

I had my friend who helped with washing the pairs of baskets each time I was done and another who helped with steaming the milk. It would be a lot easier if milk steaming wasn’t a must. 

It’s tiring but the robot can pull a relatively high volume of shots :)
