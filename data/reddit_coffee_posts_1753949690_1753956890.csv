1mdxon8,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1mdxon8/update_insane_mother_is_angry_that_her_13_year/,[UPDATE] insane mother is angry that her 13 year old wasn‚Äôt homeless after kicking her out,"Hi everyone I wasn‚Äôt expecting my last post to get so much attention but since it did I wanted to thank you all for the support and tell a bit more of my story for those interested.

My mother is a textbook narcissist, she had me at 19 to a man she‚Äôd just broken up with despite her knowing she never wanted to have kids and didn‚Äôt like them. She made this very clear to me and always made me aware that I‚Äôd ruined her life. I have always had very poor mental health due to some things that went on in my early childhood, dating back as early as around 5 years old. Now my mum was always a big advocate for mental health as she herself had been on antidepressants for years before I was born. My mum was so cool, the edgy young mum that took me to pride parades and let me stay up late and eat sweets. She really was the coolest when I was a kid, this is what made it so hard to watch her turn into a far right trad wife after meeting step dad. 

A lot of you saw a red flag when I spoke about my step dad asking me to give him ‚Äúmassages‚Äù and you weren‚Äôt wrong for thinking something was off. When I was 11 and my body was developing his behaviour toward me turned weird, I‚Äôd have to give him massages that weren‚Äôt always in appropriate places and he would do the same to me, he‚Äôd make weird comments and I‚Äôd found him raking through my underwear drawer more than once. We also didn‚Äôt have doors on most rooms including my room and the bathroom. He also took pictures of me at night in my sleep, sometimes barely clothed. Because this isn‚Äôt typically how abuse looks, I didn‚Äôt clock it till I was much older. Where was my mum? Sitting watching most of the time. 

I wasn‚Äôt physically abused very much, I was hit a few times from what I remember but nothing crazy. Although if I didn‚Äôt complete a chore well enough there was occasions step dad would put heavy weights on top of my arms and leave me there. I was however emotionally abused for sure, for example my mum would lie about medical things. She‚Äôd told me my whole life that I was allergic to strawberries so I always stayed away from them, I am in fact not, nor have I ever had a reaction to them. I don‚Äôt understand her motive for telling me that but I believed it. She also ironically told me I was a narcissist and self diagnosed me as a phyco path. Her reason for this is because when I was around 8, I really liked lego and I‚Äôd save up birthday money or pocket money to buy it, I was ¬£5 off my next Lego set and so I decided to ask my mum if I could have ¬£5 to put 
towards it. This in her mind is a narcissistic trait. 

I was made to feel like I had psychotic tendencies because of simple childish things such as not wanting to give hugs to random people at church and wanting to sit and play in my room. However whenever I did have a medical issue I was neglected. For example I broke quite a few bones growing up, nothing major but things I definitely should have been treated for, I was never allowed to see a doctor or go to the hospital under any circumstance this included issues with my mental health. After reaching out to my mum for help several times about my declining mental health and SH addiction she finally told me she‚Äôd talk to my step dad about getting me a therapist, this Ofc did not happen and he shut the idea down immediately. 

I didn‚Äôt mention this originally but I did actually speak to my mum once after leaving home. Just over a year after kicking me out she asked if we could meet for coffee and we did. I informed her I was going back to school and that I was living somewhere safe and we talked briefly about what happened. At this point I didn‚Äôt realise how badly abused I had been so I still had a lot of love for my mum. She talked about how much my sister had been acting out since I left and how she won‚Äôt listen to them only me but then she said something no 14 year old should have to hear. She told me that when social services started investigating my step dad had attempted to take his own life and that it was my fault. He was rushed to hospital and survived but wrote a letter blaming me. This was the last time I spoke to my mum and I was really messed up for a while after that. 

Since she has gotten back into contact with my grandfather she‚Äôs been making efforts to try and turn him against me, as narcs usually do. I‚Äôm a model and she showed him my modelling pictures as if this would be new information to him and he‚Äôd be bothered by it, as-well as telling him all sorts of things about how I‚Äôm evil and it‚Äôs only a matter of time before they figure it out. My grandfather defended me of course so now we‚Äôre just waiting for her to meet up with him again to see what else she could possibly have to say. ",1,1753956818.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

It lasted for over a year and I was very quick to move in with her only 3/4 months of ‚Äòdating‚Äô even though I was spending a lot of time with her since she had her own place. We realised a bit further down the line that this was a poor choice even though at the time felt so right, but we didn‚Äôt give each other time it was diving straight into the deep end from pretty much day 1. I think this contributed into most of our arguments because even though it was my home aswell I felt like I was just living in her world (even though I liked that because I was so in love with her). Skip forward about a year I ended up packing my stuff up after an argument over the phone which I sort of regret in a way as it could‚Äôve been handled better face to face but doesn‚Äôt change how I was feeling at the time. I felt pushed aside and didn‚Äôt feel like her priority anymore since she met some new girlfriends aswell as her focus was doing house renovations. We tried working together after this point but I feel like she mentally broke up with me at this point and there was no return as she was acting a bit different. The big breaking point was an argument in the car where things got very heated and got to the point where we weren‚Äôt even listening to each other anymore.

I was set on getting my own place before I met her but it was just luck that she had her own house. But after that time when I moved out of hers I was seeking my own home and now have found one & in the process of moving in. I know I have to move on now and I am trying but nothing like this is easy, especially sharing such a personal space with someone. 

I wrote her a letter a few weeks after breaking up taking responsibility of the things I did wrong in a way especially during the difficult moments, and expressed regret for how things turned out.I wasn‚Äôt writing to win her back or pressure her, but to share how I genuinely felt. She responded with removing me from Snapchat no response at all, which I felt was quite cold. 

It‚Äôs been no contact for over a month now and I would like to talk to her again in the future as we‚Äôve shared such an amazing connection it was just minor things that got way out of hand and part of that is due to my inexperience in a relationship but it does take two people for a relationship to work so it‚Äôs not just on me. My plan is to focus on my life for the next few months and once I‚Äôm settled I intend to send her a message to see if she would like to meet up for a coffee and talk.

1mdxjgz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mdxjgz,Review: Samsung Fold7 Clear Magnet Case + Grip Case + RAPTIC Aramid Fiber Case,"Wanted to share my experience after having received these 3 cases for my z fold7 so far.

Just for clarity those are the 3 cases I have:

1. [Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 Clear Grip Case](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile-accessories/phones/galaxy-z-fold7-clear-grip-case-transparent-sku-ef-qf966ctegus/?gQT=2)
2. [Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 Clear Magnet Case](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile-accessories/phones/galaxy-z-fold7-clear-magnet-case-transparent-sku-gp-fff966ycatu/)
3. [RAPTIC Aramid Fiber Case](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F99SRNXG?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) \[Tactile Woven-Humble, MagSafe\]

Goal was to get a thin case that adds minimal bulk, some basic protection and most importantly increases grip/handling. I tried using the phone naked for a few days (I have Samsung Care), but after a while I felt naked it has too sharp corners and is actually a bit too slim and too slippery for daily use. For context I was using a Pixel 9 Pro with a Casefinite THE INVISIBLE AIR ultra thin case (1mm thickness) before this.

All of the fold7 cases I ordered are just half cases protecting the back. I don't like the added bulk and look of hinge protection, although I'd consider some ultra thin front cover if such a thing ever exists (haven't really seen it yet).

In the past 10+ years I pretty much always went with some super slim clear cases (most of them actually slimmer than all the cases I got for the fold7) which served me well.

Anyways, here are my thoughts:

# 1. Samsung Clear Grip Case

I like this case the least, even though it's the thinnest and lightest of the three.  
The material appears is some hard plastic (Polycarbonate). It's quite smooth and kinda slippery (not a huge difference from the naked phone tbh) and shows fingerprints easily. Besides that it looks reasonably elegant and shows your raw naked phone body still pretty well.  
It has a textile grip so you can hold it easily with one hand or so, but beyond the first day I didn't really use this feature all that much. When you hold the phone without sliding your fingers into the grip, the grip imo gets in the way of holding the phone one handed and looks ugly.

* weight: 22.3g (measured with coffee scale)
* thickness: 1mm throughout (measured with micrometer)

Fitment and build quality is excellent. I feel like it has the right amount of snugness. Feels snug but it's still reasonably easy to remove.

Why don't I like this case?  
Besides me not using the grip much, I feel the texture of the case is too smooth and it's too thin to add enough grip (surprisingly the Samsung magnet case, while using the same material, feels better in my hand, more on that below).

# 2. Samsung Clear Magnet Case

I used this case for about 2 days and overall kinda liked it.  
While it uses the same material as the grip case, it is actually thicker and heavier. And obviously it has magsafe.  
Measurements are as follows:

* weight: 30.8g
* thickness:
   * General Backside 1.8mm
   * Backside MagSafe ring (the magsafe ring has a slightly raised profile): 2.17mm
   * Sides: 1mm

As you can see the magnet case has a higher thickness on the back than the sides (sides are identical to the grip case).

Somehow this added thickness and weight makes the phone feel better / more secure in my hand than with the grip case. I assume this because the z fold naked is so thin that its sides ""cut"" into your finger/have a small contact area, whereas with this case adding about 1.8mm thickness/side profile makes these thin sides feel less extreme.  
Another issue with the naked fold7 appears to be that due its featherweight, but the ""relatively"" heavy and thick camera island, the phone is quite top heavy (partially because it's tall), which you notice during one hand use or during thump typing on the cover screen. With the extra weight of the case distributed throughout the body of the phone its top heavyness appears sligthly less pronounced. Reminds me a bit of how adding some small weights to a pickleball paddle can change it's characteristics ;-)

Fitment and build quality is excellent and the same as the grip case.

On the magsafe function:  
The Magnet of the case is actually super strong - stronger than the RAPTIC Aramid case.  
Also the lip around the camera is relatively snug and not too thick, which allowed pretty much all my magsafe chargers (I'm testing a few car chargers) to attach to the phone without any gap, which is nice.  
Unfortunately there is one odd problem.  
The magsafe ring of the case is horizontally centered to the back of the phone, but as some others pointed out the wireless charging coil of the phone is slightly off center a bit to the right (see https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1m9f3ew/charging\_coil\_location\_on\_the\_fold7/).

In my magsafe charging comparison with the RAPTIC case I noticed this fact (and potentially the higher thickness) leads to slower charging speeds with the Samsung Magnet case than with the RAPTIC case.  
In my testing I often could only charge with about 8-9W with the Samsung case, whereas under the same conditions I got about 12W with the RAPTIC case. (this was at a charge state of \~40-50%).

Overall I kinda like this case, but if you use wireless charging a loot and want to optimize for maximum speed I'd think maybe twice. If you just want to use magsafe for attachment, but not wireless charging, this case should be fine though.

# 3. RAPTIC Aramid Fiber Case

I only got this case today, so I haven't really used it throughout my daily life, but here are my observations so far:  
The case has a nice / dry texture. Feels a bit better in the hand than the samsung clear cases, although I would say it's not necessarily super grippy either. But the samsung cases have some kind of oily / oleophobic feel to it, whereas the raptic case feels more like dry plastic or some textile.  
The quality of the case seems really good, I would say on par with the Samsung case.  
Fitment is excellent as well and actually the case sits a bit tighter than the Samsung cases. I'm not really sure I like this tightness though as it made it harder (but not impossible) to remove case during testing.  
What's a bit weird is that while all the Samsung cases are just mechanically snapped on and have a tiny lip throughout the sides/edges of the case (incl. on the side of the hinge) the raptic case has a lip only on the bottom, top and side towards the power button, but not on the side facing the hinge and instead there is an adhesive strip inside the case to compensate for that. In my first test I haven't used this adhesive strip because the phone sits so snug anyways (even though it technically just grips mechanically on 3 of the 4 sides) that it didn't seem necessary to apply the adhesive.

Measurements are as follows:

* weight: 25.9g
* thickness: 1.25mm throughout

The camera lip is a bit thicker and wider than of the Samsung cases, which leads to most of my magsafe chargers not attaching fully snug and leaving a little gap between phone back and charger (see pics) (although the gap is tiny).  
The magnet is pretty good, but noticeably weaker than the Samsung one. Subjectively the Samsung one feels about 30-35% stronger. Still the Raptic one seems strong enough to hold the phone securely. The big question is (have yet to try in practice with Raptic) with this weaker magnet is whether it pulls enough to prevent circular slides of the phone in a car (especially important when fold is unfolded and hence imbalanced). While the Samsung one has a stronger magnet, its surface is a slightly more slippery than raptic, so it might kinda even out with the Raptic one.

Design: I honestly don't really like the visual design (at least not the color scheme) but this was the only aramid fiber case I could get quickly from Amazon. I still have the same case in a different color (https://www.amazon.com/RAPTIC-Samsung-Compatible-Non-Slip-Case-Profound/dp/B0F99QGTFF?ref\_=ast\_sto\_dp) and the PITAKA Moonrise on order, so if I end up really liking this Raptic aramid fiber case, I'll probably long term switch to the blue colored Raptic or Pitaka. I bet the pitaka is super similar to the raptic anyways, besides maybe some small difference in the camera lip.

# Wireless charging speed Raptic vs Samsung case

I did a bunch of testing whether/how the case design impacts wireless charging speed. While both magsafe cases work fine to charge, I surprisingly found the RAPTIC one often leads to a higher charging speed than with the Samsung magnet case, despite the raptic case's camera lip colliding a bit with the wireless charger.  
I suspect this has to do with the alignment of the case's magnets with the position to the actual charging coil and the slight difference in thickness.  
The samsung magnet case is a bit thicker and the magnet is horizontally centered, whereas the raptic case is slightly thinner and the magnet is off-center about 0.5cm towards the right (which appears to maybe align a tad better with the location of the charging coil inside the phone). You can see in some of the pics that the wireless charger attached in different places when using the samsung vs raptic case.

For clarity I tried out these 3 wireless chargers:

* [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZFSCR41?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_fed\_asin\_title](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZFSCR41?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
* [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F1CZ7DLB?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_fed\_asin\_title](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F1CZ7DLB?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
* [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGQCPWJ4?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_fed\_asin\_title](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGQCPWJ4?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)

In my testing I could consistently achieve about 20W power consumption (measured at the AC adapter), 12W arriving at the phone (measured with Inware) with the Raptic case, whereas with the Samsung case 2 out of 3 of the wireless chargers had trouble going beyond \~15W power consumption and 8-9W arriving at the phone when I use the Samsung case. This is despite none of the chargers colliding with the camera island protection of the Samsung case. Note that with one of the chargers I could sometimes also reach about 12W speed and the Samsung case, but it seemed more finnicky and less consistently get there.  
So my hypothesis is that the Raptic case magnet location aligns better with the actual wireless charging coil position inside the phone.

# Conclusion

I don't really like the Samsung grip case as mentioned.  
If it wasn't for the charging speed difference I think It'd slightly prefer the Samsung magnet case (I like clear cases), but with the charging speed difference (I will do a bit more real world testing to confirm or deny this issue), I give the nudge to the Raptic case for now.  
I'll update this thread as I learn more about the cases in daily usage.

P.S: If someone has a recommendation for an ultra slim clear case made from a softer material (not Polycarbonate, maybe TPU) I'm all ears. I suspect a softer material (e.g. TPU) like I had in some of my older phones provides better protection and grip, but most TPU cases for the z fold7 currently on the market are too chunky for my liking.",2,1753956281.0,GalaxyFold,0,1.0,False

Sunny smiled.

‚ÄúTo be precise, this is a divine relic I recovered in the frozen wastelands. And I mean that literally ‚Äî it is a Divine Armament left behind by a slain god. I almost kicked the bucket to retrieve it, so be a darling and call me da... uncle, call me uncle.‚Äù

Effie's eyes widened.

Indeed, the great spear that looked like a bolt of obliterating lightning forged into a weapon was a Divine Weapon ‚Äî it was the spear Sunny had glimpsed in one of the truths revealed to him in Ariel's Game. That truth had shown him Weaver challenging Ariel to a Death Game on a blood-soaked battlefield in a frozen hell... with Ariel inhabiting the body of a dying Divine. Sunny could remember every detail of that scene vividly...
The endless white plain, the broken corpses of lesser gods, the rivers of ichor flowing into the depths of the frozen ocean, the tendrils of nothingness seeping into reality through the cracks in the shattered sky... the giant kneeling in the middle of the silent battlefield, grasping his fractured head with two enormous hands as he mumbled disjointed words, full of terror.

And a great spear laying on the broken ice, forgotten, still brimming with the echoes of annihilating lightning.

...The giant might have forgotten about his spear before dying, his body swallowed by the imprisoned ocean, but Sunny had not. So, he ventured into frozen wastelands hoping to find it.

Luckily, discovering the battlefield from his vision had not been too difficult ‚Äî at least not for Sunny, who could cast his shadow sense across numerous kilometers and move with breathtaking speed. After all, there were not a lot of places where the sky was shattered and tendrils of nothingness seeped into reality, even in the Dream Realm.
Surviving that harrowing place, however... that was an entirely different matter. Thousands of years had passed since the day he saw in the vision of truth, and the entire area had become far more eerie and terrifying, not to mention chillingly lethal, than it used to be.

Everything was swallowed by the ice and bathed in the familiar white mist... only something seemed to be hiding in the mist there, making his skin crawl. The unbearable cold was almost absolute, far worse than even the Winter Beast's blizzard had been.

Sunny had wanted to explore the battlefield thoroughly, but in the end, he barely managed to retrieve the spear from deep within the ice before hastily making a retreat. The spear had been gigantic at first, but as soon as he touched it, it shrank to its current size.

That eerie place, that sense of terrible fear, that cold... was something he wished to never relive.

Looking at Effie, Sunny smirked.
‚ÄúSo, what do you say?""

Enthralled, Effie leaned forward and picked the spear.

‚ÄúThanks, uncle-uahh!""

Barely lifting the spear off the ground, Effie toppled over and landed on her face, making Sunny laugh again.

‚ÄúOh, sorry! I forgot to mention... it's quite heavy.‚Äù

Effie herself was also a... top-heavy person. So, it was no wonder that she had lost balance and ended up falling down.

Laying on the ground, she gave him a glare, then stood up and reached for the great spear once again. With a grunt, Effie lifted it after all. Lean muscles rolled under her dewy olive skin, and beads of sweat glistened on her face.
Sunny was not surprised to see her shouldering the crushing weight of the Divine weapon that made even a Sovereign struggle ‚Äî if anyone had enough raw physical strength to carry the great spear, it was Effie. She studied it with a contemplative expression, then smiled.
‚ÄúAwesome. However... I don't think I am st–≥ong enough to wield it in battle. No Saint is.""

Sunny lingered for a few moments, then nodded.

‚ÄúIndeed, no Saint is. Which brings us to the next point of this conversation, and the real reason I'm here. Actually, I feel a bit awkward giving this speech for the second time, but here it goes... Nephis and I are going to appoint Apotheosis sooner or later, which means...""

Effie waved a hand in the air dismissively.
‚ÄúIf you are about to tell me how someone else has to become Supreme before you guys jump into the Fifth Nightmare, no need. Actually, I already met Kai in NQSC, and he regaled me with the tale of your misadventures in the Death Game over some drinks. So, you can skip the explanation. I already know.‚Äù

Sunny stared at her for a few seconds.
""And?""

Effie placed the golden spear back on the ground and shrugged.

""Sure, I'm in.""

He blinked a couple of times.

‚ÄúThat, uh... you know that we are talking about you challenging the Fourth Nightmare, right? Not immediately, I mean ‚Äî but eventually. That is the reason I took Kai to Ariel's Game, and that is why I want to take you to the Mirror Maze. To help you prepare.""

Effie yawned again, then let out a groan.
‚ÄúDamn it... all this talk of attaining Supremacy, and I haven't even had my morning coffee yet. I said sure, didn't I? Let's do it! Let's get me ready to challenge the Fourth Nightmare... eventually. Preferably after I had breakfast.""

Sunny stared at her silently, then shook his head.

""Don't you need time to consider? Only four people in history have survived the F–æurth Nightmare, you know.‚Äù

Effie met his gaze, then smiled faintly.
‚ÄúLook around.‚Äù

Sunny did, studying the cozy wooden home and the picturesque grounds of the manor.
Effie, meanwhile, picked up the Divine spear and carefully leaned it against a nearby tree.

‚ÄúI have stuff to protect, Sunny.‚Äù

It was a very simple answer... but one that said it all.
Brushing the dirt off her sweatpants and her stretched-out crop top, Effie started whistling a cheerful melody as she headed inside.

‚ÄúDon't dawdle! It's the full moon tonight, so let's grab something to eat and discuss what, exactly, we are going to do in the Mirror Maze. Oh, and also...""

She turned around and smiled.

‚ÄúThank you for the spear, really. I mean it.‚Äù
Then, Effie's smile turned into a grin.

‚ÄúI mean, I did not know what to expect when you began boasting about the size of your bundle, but when you took that thing out... good heavens! It really...""

Heading into the house, Sunny pushed her inside.

‚ÄúShut the hell up!""

Tldr: Creating a Coffee brand, need insights. If you are a coffee lover, please share insights. If you a marketer, help me differentiate.

First of all - As a digital marketer, I'm absolutely fascinated by the passion and knowledge within this subreddit. 

I'm currently working with an incredible, nascent coffee brand based out of Uttarkhand, India, and we're at a pivotal stage: **defining our unique differentiators in a crowded coffee market.** 

We know we're not a mass-market, grab-and-go experience like a big brands like Starbuks ‚Äì and frankly, that's by design. 

***Our focus*** is squarely on the¬†art¬†and¬†science¬†of specialty coffee. We're talking about a meticulous, almost obsessive, **approach**: *each bean carefully sourced, often directly from sustainable farms, with a deep understanding of its terroir. Our roasting is precision-driven, aiming to unlock the fullest potential of every varietal.* All our products are single origin. We have cracked a few formulations of roasting too. 

We believe in transparency about our supply chain and the stories behind the beans and the farmers who cultivate them.

We are premium coffee brand (building), but for people who know Coffee is NOT equal to Calories + Coffee. It is pure just coffee. 

**But here's where I need your collective genius:**

When you think of a truly exceptional,¬†*specialty*¬†coffee brand that resonates with you ‚Äì one that goes ""beyond the brew"" and leaves a lasting impression ‚Äì what are the less obvious, but deeply impactful, elements that make it stand out?

We're trying to articulate what truly sets us apart, and we want to move beyond just saying ""we have good coffee"" *(because, let's be honest, many specialty brands do!).*

**Specifically, I'd love to hear your thoughts on:**

* Beyond tasting notes: What kind of¬†*storytelling*¬†truly captivates you about a coffee brand?¬†Is it the journey of the bean, the passion of the roaster, the impact on the community?
* What tangible or intangible¬†*experiences*¬†do you seek from a specialty coffee brand that you don't get elsewhere?¬†Is it the educational aspect, the community engagement, the aesthetic of their packaging, or something else entirely?
* How important is¬†*transparency*¬†to you, not just about sourcing, but about the brand's values, processes, and even challenges?
* When you're exploring new specialty coffee, what makes you take the leap and try a brand you've never heard of?¬†Is it a recommendation, a unique origin, a specific processing method, or something else that piques your curiosity?
* In a world where ""specialty"" can sometimes feel like a buzzword, what¬†*actions*¬†or¬†*commitments*¬†from a brand truly validate the claim of being ""specialty"" in your eyes?
* Are there any ""anti-differentiators"" ‚Äì things that a specialty brand might do that would immediately turn you off, even if their coffee is good?

As of Packaging,

* Have you seen any ""Wow"" packaging that you can never forget - it can be from Wine, Coffee, Perfume industry. It will give us some perspective.

I am genuinely eager to learn from your perspectives as passionate coffee consumers. Your insights will be invaluable as we hone our brand identity and messaging to truly connect with those who appreciate the finer nuances of coffee.

Thanks in advance for sharing your wisdom!

I wanted to share a little experiment. I‚Äôve been running over the past 3 weeks, not promoting anything, just documenting my own journey. I‚Äôve been combining two herbal supports: **green coffee & trikatu.** 

* **Green coffee Extracts** to help with metabolism and curb appetite
* **Trikatu** for supporting digestion and aid fat breakdown

# What I‚Äôve noticed so far

1. **Appetite control** I‚Äôm feeling less compelled to snack between meals. Instead of reaching for something out of habit, I genuinely wait until I‚Äôm hungry.
2. **Stable energy** No more mid-morning or mid-afternoon crashes. My focus and alertness feel more consistent throughout the day.
3. **Subtle changes in measurements** I‚Äôm tracking waist and hip circumference weekly; so far I‚Äôve seen a 1‚Äì1.5 cm reduction around my waist, though it‚Äôs still early days.
4. **Water Retention;** I'm trying to keep an eye on it as I drink more water and use the herbs, but I haven't seen any big changes.

I‚Äôm recording everything in a simple spreadsheet and planning to review trends at the 6-8 week marks.

**Eager to know if anyone else here has tried a natural or herbal combination of approaches to manage weight?**

* Have you tracked things like energy, carb intake, water retention, body measurements, or even body-fat percentage?
* What changes did you notice and in how much time?
* Any tips on adjusting dosage, timing, or pairing with lifestyle factors (exercise, meal composition, sleep)?

I don‚Äôt want children, and he says having kids is a non-negotiable for him. We've had a few serious talks about it over the years. It was the *only* topic we ever argued about, but it was a big one. Everything else in our relationship was genuinely amazing: no drama, mutual respect, love, and support. We rarely fought and truly brought out the best in each other.

He‚Äôs very laid-back and ‚Äúgo with the flow,‚Äù and his view is: *‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just live our lives, and when the time comes, we‚Äôll decide. People change. We might feel differently in 10 years.‚Äù*  
But I‚Äôm someone who needs structure and long-term clarity. I kept feeling like we were investing in a relationship that had a built-in expiration date. The hardest part was that he couldn‚Äôt promise me he‚Äôd choose *us* over the possibility of having kids if it ever came down to that.

After a long talk, we agreed to break up. We even went to our couple‚Äôs therapist to talk it through. She leaned a bit toward his view of letting life unfold naturally, but ultimately supported the breakup and is now helping me work through my own stuff, including unresolved issues from my childhood and my relationship with my mother (which might also play into how I feel about parenting).

Since the breakup, I‚Äôve been trying to move forward. I‚Äôve talked to a few people online and went on a couple of casual meetups, but haven‚Äôt felt any romantic or emotional spark. Just trying to move on, little by little.

Then, my ex reached out. We got coffee, and all the feelings came rushing back‚Äîfor both of us. We talked for hours. It felt like we‚Äôd never broken up. He said he still loves me and gave me two options:

1. Get back together and try to work through my fears and uncertainty about the future
2. Accept the breakup for real and move on

Now I‚Äôm stuck. I love him deeply. But I don‚Äôt want to set myself (or him) up for heartbreak if this core disagreement never gets resolved.

**So I‚Äôm here asking: What should I do? Is it worth trying again, knowing we still disagree on something so fundamental? Has anyone made a relationship like this work?**

I‚Äôm child-free by choice (though I‚Äôm aware my trauma with my mom may play into that). He, on the other hand, says having kids is a non-negotiable for him. We‚Äôve talked about it a few times over the years, and it was honestly the only issue we ever argued about. In every other way, we were a great match‚Äîkind, loving, respectful, rarely ever fought.

Here's a simple summary of what‚Äôs happening:

# üßä Heatwave Driving Ice Cream Sales ‚Äì But Shelves Are Empty

* Due to ongoing extreme heat, **some products are sold out**, and shortages may continue.

# ü•õ Big Price Increases Coming in August ‚Äì Especially for Dairy

* **Milk** will go up **10‚Äì20 yen per bottle**.
* This is because the **raw milk price (‰π≥‰æ°)** that dairy farmers charge to manufacturers is increasing by **4 yen per kilogram (before tax)**.
* The raise aims to help dairy farmers deal with **labor shortages** and lack of successors.

# üßÉ Products Using Milk Are Also Going Up:

* **Yukijirushi Coffee Milk**: Up another **10 yen** (2nd increase this year).
* **Yogurt**: Most types will rise by **10‚Äì12 yen**.
* **Fruiche** (milk-based dessert): Will rise by around **20 yen**.

# üìà August Price Hikes Overall:

* According to Teikoku Databank, **1,010 food and drink items** will go up in price in August.
* This is **fewer than in July**, but still a major impact.

# üçò Coming in September: Rice Crackers

* Most brands of **senbei (rice crackers)** will go up **10‚Äì20 yen** due to high rice prices.

# üçö Rice Prices to Keep Rising

* The purchase price of this year‚Äôs **new rice** is expected to be **1.5 times higher**.
* In Hokkaido, 5 kg of rice may go up **500‚Äì600 yen**.
* This could raise prices of existing **branded rice** too.

1mdwr7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1mdwr7s/lost/,Lost,"

I‚Äôm at a loss for words, but this is the only place I feel comfortable sharing my struggles. I‚Äôm a 20-year-old man, and my life has taken a drastic turn since I was 16. I used to be a happy and carefree person, living life to the fullest. But in just four short years, everything I had been eagerly anticipating or dreaming of has turned out to be a nightmare.

Let‚Äôs start with school. I graduated from high school and moved away to attend university. While I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to further my education, I feel incredibly lost and lonely there. I do the same things over and over again. I‚Äôve lost all my friends, and I don‚Äôt party or go out anymore. I spend most of my time studying until my eyes are red. I pretend to my parents that I‚Äôm fine, but inside, I‚Äôm struggling to go through the motions of the day.

It‚Äôs been strange since I‚Äôve always been known as a fun-loving, chill, and non-emotional guy. But I feel the changes. I don‚Äôt smile as much anymore, and things that used to make me happy don‚Äôt even get a reaction from me. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can keep going. My dreams haven‚Äôt changed, and I‚Äôm trying to trust the process, but I can‚Äôt anymore. The more I struggle, the more I feel like I‚Äôm slipping away here, the less and less I want to be here. I miss home, and on top of that, my love life has been a rollercoaster. I guess that‚Äôs the main reason I‚Äôm making this post and where I can trace all my sadness to.

So, where to begin? When I was in high school, I met this girl. She was my first girlfriend, and I thought it was cool. For about six weeks, she cheated on me. I was so dumb that I thought since I ‚Äúloved‚Äù her, I could forget and forgive her. But she kept cheating over and over again, and we kept breaking up. We were on and off for about ten months. I was just trying to understand why someone I thought loved me would put me through all this. But her cheating wasn‚Äôt even the worst part.

During the last two months of our ‚Äúrelationship,‚Äù she cheated on me while pretending to be pregnant. To get out of it, she took my virginity and then baby-trapped me because she thought I was the only option with money. This devastated me and caused an internal battle of whether to take the high road or go lower. I chose the latter. I lost myself in hate.

For four weeks, I turned into someone I couldn‚Äôt recognize. I did things I never thought capable. Since she cheated on me, I cheated back tenfold. But it didn‚Äôt stop there. I told the entire school what she did. I even made up stories about her and had a rumor network so large that she stopped showing up to school. I thought I had won. I thought I had given her a fitting punishment. But something felt off. I found myself crying, feeling terrible for what I had done.

I caught wind that she had gone to an asylum and didn‚Äôt return until three months later. In my guilt, I couldn‚Äôt even look at her. I had destroyed her. I had taken her cheating on me too far. I had lied and said I loved her and that she was safe with me. I had let her believe that I would never leave until her lowest point. I had vanished like I had said I would.

This is a moment that represents a turning point for me. I wanted to go on a path of love after what I had done. If anything bad happened to me, I deserved it. But after that, I fell in love with another girl. She was amazing, although I was still hurting. She made me so happy and I felt so loved. But all good things must come to an end. I betrayed her trust, but I never cheated. I lied to her, and from that point forward, our relationship was doomed. We stuck it out, believing we could overcome it, but that didn‚Äôt happen. We broke up, and she admitted to cheating on me on several occasions. I didn‚Äôt flinch. I remained calm, but she had another trick up her sleeve. She continued to call and text me. I tried to reason with her, but all she did was try to get me mad, rage bait me, if you will. But I never gave in. Then, she tried to say she was pregnant. I thought, ‚ÄúTwo times in a row, this can‚Äôt be real.‚Äù But it was. She tried and tried, but ultimately, I didn‚Äôt falter. Eventually, she stopped harassing me, and I let out a breath of fresh air.

Now, this is where most men in my position would just stop trying to get with women. But me, that was far too simple. I developed a crush on a girl, and it was mutual. For weeks, we hung out together, and I thought it was going well. Until one night. She called me to come over to her house for company because she was drunk and lonely. I obliged, stayed up until about 3 am, and then she invited me to her bed. If you could go back in time, I would stop myself right there and go home. But alas, I can‚Äôt. So, I climbed into bed with her and had a restless night of sleep. I woke up the next morning, and she told me to leave. I did. Two weeks passed, and I heard nothing from her. I was stressed, pacing in my apartment, calling my parents, not knowing what her issue was. Then, we met for coffee, and she laid it on me. ‚ÄúI felt you trying to kiss me while I was unresponsive.‚Äù This hit like a truck. I was shocked, completely flabbergasted. I started to question myself, but I kept a cool head. I told her that I was sorry she felt that way, but that‚Äôs not what happened. But those words fell on deaf ears. She told me that it didn‚Äôt matter what I said; she wouldn‚Äôt believe me, and she didn‚Äôt know how my friends would react to this information. I got up, said thank you, and went back to my place. A fit of rage followed everything that happened. I was a decent, kind, and respectful person. I had never done anything on a nonconsensual basis with a woman, but she had the audacity to accuse me. My parents tried to calm me down, but to no avail. I was hurt, angry, sad, and everything in between. I called my assistant and told her, ‚ÄúI need to get out.‚Äù Two hours later, I was on a plane to Turks and deleted all my social media accounts. I sat with myself for hours, not knowing what to do. I wanted to clear things up with my friends, but if they had already bought her story, then my word is meaningless. I eventually just remembered what I had done to my first girlfriend and told myself, ‚ÄúI deserve this.‚Äù It was time to pay the price for my actions, and the cost was enormous.

I feel damaged and lost. I can‚Äôt live right or love right. I‚Äôm just cursed to constantly be hurt by the very people I love. This is my life, and I just have to weather the storm until it passes.",2,1753953247.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

1mdwqel,https://www.reddit.com/r/BannedFromDiscord/comments/1mdwqel/ive_been_banned_and_got_advice_from_my_compsci/,I've been banned and got advice from my CompSci major friend.,"Basically he told me that using a VPN is a bit overkill for ban evasion. He basically gave me these points:  
1. Changing your IP address is extreme paranoia and won't do anything, discord will not IP ban as other people unrelated to your ban may be using it and your personal IP address is not what they track, they track your modem IP which does not really change unless you have specific circumstances.   
2. VPNs, discord definitely knows and can tell when and if you are using a VPN, he told me because the VPN is basically to hide your IP it really isn't too necessary but if you are paranoid just download a free VPN like ProtonVPN (PC and mobile compatible) and turn it off after about a week.   
3. Behaviour tracking, definitely don't immediately rejoin all your servers ect. that is a point he said is probably true, whilst discord technically can't read your messages they can see who you're friended to, the servers you're in ect.   
4. Appeals, he told me that instead of appealing by website you could try calling discord customer support directly and attempt to hit your \* or # symbols on your dial page so it bypasses the AI's such as clyde. Although this might not work.  
5. Don't say random stuff to get banned, I had to learn this the hard way, don't argue with strangers over controversial things or in general try not to speak to them outside of trusted online friends, they can always get you banned by false reporting you.  
6. Keep on attempting to escalate from clyde bot to a human moderator in appeals, just keep replying 1-2 days after clyde emails you so you can escalate it eventually and see a human. Essentially the online version of ""I want to see your manager""  
7. File with BBB (Better Business Bureau) and ask for them to contact discord so you can get a human mod.  
8. Don't victim play usually as humans can see past it or at least try to apologise and try to compromise a less harsh punishment. Do not use foul language ect and try to be formal and persuasive. Remember those english lessons in 9th or 8th grade we all did? Use those to your advantage, write a persuasive argument. Humans are much more prone to persuasive arguments than AI language models. Attempt to connect with them on a human level e.g ""I know you probably have gone through 8 coffees reading these but hear my case..."" or ""I know you've seen some stupid arguments and terrible people but.."" and ""Give me a second chance ect...""  
9. Good luck on Ban evasion or your appeal process!",8,1753953152.0,BannedFromDiscord,5,1.0,False

Common mistakes when drinking water  
1. Excessive water consumption  
Some people believe that you need to drink a lot of water, without taking into account the importance of electrolytes. This can lead to imbalances and even dehydration.  
üí° Drink as much water as your body needs.  
  
2. Drinking water too quickly  
üö∞ Rapid absorption of large volumes of water can cause sodium imbalance and provoke edema.  
  
3. Replacing water with other beverages  
Coffee, tea, alcohol, and sugary soda are not a substitute for water.  
‚òï Coffee and tea have a diuretic effect.  
üç∑Alcohol dehydrates the body.  
ü•§ Sweet carbonated drinks aggravate the problem of dehydration.  
‚ùó Also, taking diuretics with caffeine can significantly increase fluid deficiency.  
  
4. Potassium and sodium imbalance  
üßÇ Excessive potassium intake without sufficient sodium can lead to dehydration.  
‚öñA balance of sodium and potassium is critical for health.  
People often suffer from:  
üîπ Fluid retention with potassium deficiency.  
üîπ Excess salt with insufficient vegetables in the diet.  
ü•¶ Add potassium-rich vegetables to your diet to balance the balance.  
  
5. Drinking water with meals  
üö´ Drinking large amounts of water with meals can dilute gastric juice and impair digestion, contributing to acid reflux.  
üí° It is better to drink water before or after meals.  
  
6. Drinking water that is too cold  
ü•∂ Cold water can slow down the vagus nerve, which is responsible for digestion.  
  
7. Drinking untreated water  
üö∞ Tap water may contain chlorine, fluoride, and other harmful substances.  
üí° Use filters or tested spring water.  
‚úÖ Each of these points is important for a healthy water balance.

IDK if there is a better place to post this but Im new to reddit and only know this subreddit. I wanted to run a situation for some unbiased opinions. I (22 F) have been dating my boyfriend (23 M) for about three years now. We have had a stable relationship and are always open with one another. I moved to New York post grad and he moved to Texas, so we have been long distance for about a year. A close friend from college, let's call her Mae is originally form this same city in Texas. Back in college, Mae did not know my boyfriend until we started dating. I always loved introducing him to my friends and me his. It was nice knowing everyone could get along well. However, this particular friend had always been closerrr than my other friends. She would often ask me when he is coming by the house next, ask if she could join us on small little hangouts like getting coffee, going to movies or our study dates, and enjoyed 1 on 1 convos more than my other friends with him. She also often brought him up when we were hanging out in our friend group. In particular, she would bring up how handsome/cute/hot he was and how lucky I was that I could bag him. I never found this too weird just because I thought it was in a ""hype your girlies up"" kind of way. Fast forward to now. She moved back home after a breakup. I was facetiming my boyfriend the other day and he tells me that Mae reached out to him to meet up for dinner. My boyfriend gets along with people pretty easily but was never too close with Mae. Still, I wasn't too taken aback by this since they do live in the same city and Im sure she wanted some familiar faces/support especially post breakup. After this convo, I texted Mae just saying ""hey bf told me yall are planning to meet up! miss yall wish I could join"" She texts me back and says ""Oh it actually won't work out since Im so busy. Hope you're well!"" Again, didn't think anything of this just thought oh that was a quick turn around lol. A couple days pass and Im on facetime with my boyfriend again. On this call, I ask him about his day and he tells me that he did in fact go to happy hour/dinner with Mae. I proceeded to go ""oh! Mae told me she was too busy and you guys weren't going anymore"" and he looked slightly confused and just said no she planned it time and place and everything. With that, this place is very much a date spot (he took us there when I previously visited) He also mentioned how she had him take the bill because that is ""typically what the man does in places like this"" (his words about what she said not mine). My man is a very nonchalant guy and I know wouldn't hurt me. I brought up what she told me and how she cancelled on him and how I feel kind of weirded out by this if she was 'lying' to me in some way, but my boyf thinks I'm just overanalyzing. It is true that I am a chronic overthinker in every aspect of my life not just relationships so he could very well be clocking me correctly here.

Yeah, well, imagine if that wasn't a problem anymore.

Picture this: You wake up and there's already coffee happening. Not because you made it, obviously, but because someone who genuinely loves you looked at your face and thought, ""This person needs caffeine and also probably shouldn't operate heavy machinery right now.""

""Morning, babe,"" he says, and he's got that look. Not the judgy look‚Äîthe other one. The one that says he's already handled three of the things that were going to ruin your day. ""So I moved your dentist appointment because I know you'll hate yourself if you have to do that AND grocery shopping on the same day. Also, your mom called, I told her you'd call back after you've had food.""

This is **faff**, and honestly, it should have existed years ago.

He knows you'll spend forty-five minutes staring into the fridge if left unsupervised, so he's already ordered groceries. He knows you'll agree to drinks with Aditi even though you've had People Time every day this week and you're running on fumes, so he's crafted the perfect ""maybe next week?"" text that somehow makes you sound social AND responsible.

Your phone buzzes: *""Moved your 'existential crisis about career' to Thursday after yoga. You'll have better perspective then. Also bought you those face masks.""*

He's made a folder on your laptop called ""Bills But Like, Friendly Ones"" and somehow paying for internet doesn't feel like a personal attack anymore. Your calendar isn't just color-coded‚Äîit's *emotionally* color-coded. Green for ""you'll actually enjoy this,"" yellow for ""necessary but survivable,"" red for ""only when you're feeling strong.""

When you inevitably melt down about being behind on everything, he doesn't tell you to get organized. He pulls up his phone and starts reading: ""Things you accomplished this week that you forgot about because your brain is mean to you: You watered the plants, you remembered your friend's birthday, you did laundry AND put it away the same day, you...""

The best relationships aren't just about love, they're about systems. They're about someone looking at your beautiful, chaotic life and thinking, ""I can work with this."" Not to fix you, but to *support* you. To be the infrastructure for your dreams, the one who remembers you need snacks during phone calls and that you're funnier after 10 AM.

In the **faff** universe, nobody's calling you lazy. You're just someone who needs a really good personal assistant who also happens to give amazing hugs and split the Netflix bill.

Teen Titans Go! is definitely obnoxious in its existence but also has its own charm and humor that is legitimately funny. I think Sailor Moon could be a blast as this sort of short form shenanigans.

I was doing some re-watching and Usagi busts out the Disguise Pen to transform herself into whatever to get into places, and then it hit me. You know who else uses disguises? That's right! Bugs Bunny, Scooby and Shaggy, the Animaniacs, etc. Even Sonic the Hedgehog. They don a disguise and fuck with the villain. It's a classic cartoon comedy bit.

It was episode 7 specifically when this revelation occurred. She transforms herself into an actress. And immediately in my head the scenario turned into Usagi doing a ""snooty star"" bit and cow the monster into being her assistant by demanding her she get her coffee but its too hot and then its too cold and then she doesnt want coffee anymore and she'll be in her trailer yadda-yadda. 

You know, what Bugs Bunny does with Elmer Fudd all the time until being found out and the chase begins again.

If that didn‚Äôt work, then I would lock myself in my room, sit on my reclining office chair with my arms over my head and just bear through the pain. Once the stone passed and the pain was instantly gone, I was left exhausted and would usually take a nap for a few hours. 

At some point I did go do an ultrasound, but the doctor said that while I do have a few stones, the gallbladder was not inflamed so there was no urgency to remove it. 
So I honestly thought that by adjusting my diet I could get better and avoid surgery. So I started cutting out deep fried foods, and it seemed to work at first but as days went by I had to cut out any fat food, then red meat, then dairy, then coffee‚Ä¶ by the 4 week mark I didn‚Äôt have any food that wouldn‚Äôt cause an attack. 

Then one day I had the worse attack yet that felt like all my organs in the abdomen were being cut up. I could only lie on my left side and scream, I vaguely remember screaming to my husband that I think something exploded inside and to call the ambulance. I ended up in the ER with sever acute pancreatitis. 

As the ER doctor explained it, my gallbladder indeed was never inflamed but the last stone got lodged by the pancreas and prevented the digestive enzymes from exiting. My pancreas therefore ended up digesting itself, 20% of it was lost to necrosis and all those fluids were inside my abdomen. I cannot describe the pain I felt, but whenever my morphine would wear off I simply couldn‚Äôt breathe. That lasted for 4 days.

After a week and a plethora of painkillers, CT scans and blood works, I was finally discharged. but since my pancreas needed to recover and the inflammation inside my abdominal cavity had to go down, I was put on a NG tube feeding for 4 weeks until my removal surgery. It ensures that the gallbladder will not be solicited and therefore no more stones will pass. 

The only flavours I tasted for the past month were black tea or water. I don‚Äôt remember what chewing feels like. The thought of eating food again brings me joy and fear. My surgery is planned for next week, and I honestly cannot wait. 

So if you experienced attacks before and are still on the fence or if your doctor is saying it‚Äôs not urgent - find another doctor and get it done anyway.",9,1753952237.0,gallbladders,2,1.0,False

Gave up on sleeping, got out of bed at like 5 a.m. and took a shower.

[Dr. Sachin Patil](https://g.co/kgs/nHZr6sE), a leading urologist at AIMS Urology Hospital, explains that **urinary tract infections (UTIs)** are mostly *invited in* ‚Äî by the stuff we keep doing every single day.

Let‚Äôs break it down.  
You‚Äôre chugging coffee all day but barely touching water.  
You‚Äôre holding in pee like it‚Äôs an Olympic sport.  
You wear tight, sweaty clothes after the gym, thinking, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll shower later.‚Äù  
And that 2-second swipe with dry tissue? Not cutting it

UTIs love a dirty scene ‚Äî bacteria climb up, throw a rave in your urinary tract, and before you know it, every bathroom trip feels like punishment.

And here‚Äôs the kicker: untreated UTIs can mess with your kidneys. Pain, fever, fatigue? Yeah, they escalate *fast*. The Urologist in Pune warns that recurring UTIs are a sign your daily routine needs a full detox ‚Äî not just meds.

So fix the basics:  
‚Üí Hydrate like it‚Äôs a job  
‚Üí Pee *when* your body tells you to  
‚Üí Clean right, not just fast  
‚Üí Ditch bad habits before they turn into prescriptions

Take the hint from your body. Burning pee isn‚Äôt normal ‚Äî it‚Äôs a red flag.",1,1753951744.0,GoodDoctorsinPune,0,1.0,False

1mdwcyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1mdwcyp/aita_for_declining_a_wedding_invitation/,AITA for declining a wedding invitation,"Hello everyone, my name E(28F) have been in a very nice relationship with my coworker AM(27F) and G(26F), I would even say friends, we met at work and have been communicating for 1,5 years, we work in a kinda stressful and toxic ambience, and that build, as I thought, a powerful bond between us . We would encourage each other, help in need, and be there for each other. For some clearance I‚Äôm married, and expecting a baby boy, AM is engaged , and G is single. In April AM got engaged and we all were super happy for her, in the meantime she also build a strong bond with another coworker AG (33F) who is older then us, which is totally fine she‚Äôs also a very nice and supportive person. All good and peaceful, AM was planning the wedding and telling that it will be in September, and after that dates swatch for end of August, she told us this information, to which I said that most probably me and my husband couldn‚Äôt attend because it may interfere with our vacation, at that time I didn‚Äôt know I was pregnant. Shortly after I found out about it, of course I told about it to my work friends. And of course being pregnant is quite an expence, adding there the vacation and some renovations that we should also do in our house, all in quite a short time leaves us no free money for attending the wedding. At the end of the July she invited us to the wedding, and we politely declined the invitation. I did bring up the financial situation, wished them to have an amazing evening and stuff. Was planning on a wedding gift from us, even if we couldn‚Äôt attend. She seemed a little upset. After few hours she send me a message that they are not doing this for money, and if we change our mind we are very welcome. In our country attending a wedding is quite expressive, for a couple it‚Äôs smth like 1-1,5K ‚Ç¨(when average salary is 500‚Ç¨ +/-, mine 550, my husband is making smth like 2K and covers almost all our living expenses +the house). She left for a vacation and we haven‚Äôt spoke since. When she returned I tried to speak with her like before, we used to have coffee before work, but she ignored me and acted passive aggressive, shutting the doors and stuff, turning her back to me, to which I tried to speak to her. She implied that my decision not to come to her wedding will have consequences, that we are no longer friends but only coworkers, that she knew that we don‚Äôt quite like attending weddings and stuff but she expected me to make and exception for her. I tried to explain that now have more expenses on us, and not coming to her wedding doesn‚Äôt mean that I don‚Äôt wanna be friends with her. The most hurtful thing that slapped me in the face was her saying that I can‚Äôt understand her feelings because I didn‚Äôt have such a special day as she does so we are not at the same page(we didn‚Äôt have a wedding or stuff, just registered and went for wedding trip just the two of us). She said that they had been last year to 8 weddings and this year to 5(her soon to be husband is a orthodontist so I guess they can afford it more easier) and I can‚Äôt even make an exception for her, and that others are coming from other countries to attend the wedding and the fact that I could not means I don‚Äôt consider her friend and don‚Äôt respect her.. the thing on top, she didn‚Äôt invite G who is also our friend at all, because she can‚Äôt afford to cover the expenses for her seat at the wedding. But she invited AG with whom she caught up recentlyü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Anyway she‚Äôs free to invite whoever she considers, it‚Äôs none of my business. 
Now I‚Äôm in a situation where I am working with AM day by day in the same room not changing a word, at all, and the air and tension is so so thick in the room you could cut it with a knife‚Ä¶ 
So, AITA  for politely declining the wedding invitation?

The sign slapped against the glass door in the wind‚Äîbold, blocky letters that caught my eye mid-jog. I wasn‚Äôt out for exercise. I was trying to outrun the weight pressing on my chest: overdue rent, climbing student loans, and the hollow thud of every ‚ÄúWe regret to inform you‚Äù that kept piling into my inbox.

I had a degree. Engineering, no less. Supposed to be a golden ticket. Instead, it bought me rejection emails and a gnawing sense of failure.

But what stopped me cold was the pay: $55 per hour.

I blinked, wondering if I‚Äôd read it wrong. No experience required. Night shift. Immediate start.

It sounded too good to be true‚Äîwhich usually meant it was. But I stood there, heart racing, rereading it like the words might disappear if I looked away. My bank account had dipped below zero three days ago. I‚Äôd been living on canned soup and pride.

I looked down at the bottom of the flyer and read the address aloud under my breath:

3921 Old Pine Road, California.

I sighed. New town, no family, no friends‚Äîjust me, chasing some kind of fresh start in a place that didn‚Äôt know my name. It wasn‚Äôt ideal. But it was something. A flicker of hope. A paycheck.

By 10 p.m., I was there.

The store wasn‚Äôt anything spectacular. In fact, it was a lot smaller than I‚Äôd imagined.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I thought this would be, like, a giant Walmart,‚Äù I muttered to myself, taking in the dim, flickering sign saying ‚ÄúEvergroove‚Äù and the eerie silence around me. There were no other shops in sight‚Äîjust a lone building squatting on the side of a near-empty highway, swallowed by darkness on all sides.

It felt more like a rest stop for ghosts than a convenience store.

But I stepped forward anyway. As a woman, I knew the risk of walking into sketchy places alone. Every instinct told me to turn around. But when you‚Äôre desperate, even the strangest places can start to look like second chances.

The bell above the door gave a hollow jingle as I walked in. The store was dimly lit, aisles stretching ahead like crooked teeth in a too-wide grin. The reception counter was empty and the cold hit me like a slap.

Freezing.

Why was it so cold in the middle of July?

I rubbed my arms, breath fogging slightly as I looked around. That‚Äôs when I heard the soft shuffle of footsteps, followed by a creak.

Someone stepped out from the furthest aisle, his presence sudden and uncanny. A grizzled man with deep lines etched into his face like cracked leather.

‚ÄúWhat d‚Äôyou want?‚Äù he grunted, voice gravelly and dry.

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ I saw a sign. Are you guys hiring?‚Äù

He stared at me too long. Long enough to make me question if I‚Äôd said anything at all.

Then he gave a slow nod and turned his back.

‚ÄúFollow me,‚Äù he said, already turning down the narrow hallway. ‚ÄúHope you‚Äôre not scared of staying alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve done night shifts before.‚Äù I said recalling the call center night shift in high school, then retail during college. I was used to night shifts. They kept me away from home. From shouting matches. From silence I didn‚Äôt know how to fill.

The old man moved faster than I expected, his steps brisk and sure, like he didn‚Äôt have time to waste.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt your average night shift,‚Äù he muttered, glancing back at me with a look I couldn‚Äôt quite read. Like he was sizing me up‚Ä¶ or reconsidering something.

We reached a cramped employee office tucked behind a heavy door. He rummaged through a drawer, pulled out a clipboard, and slapped a yellowed form onto the desk.

‚ÄúFill this out,‚Äù he said, sliding the clipboard toward me. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre good to start, the shift begins tonight.‚Äù

He paused‚Äîjust long enough that I wondered if he was waiting for me to back out. But I didn‚Äôt.

I picked up the pen and skimmed the contract, the paper cold and stiff beneath my fingers. One line snagged my attention like a fishhook, Minimum term: One year. No early termination.

Maybe they didn‚Äôt want employees quitting after making a decent paycheck. Still, something about it felt off.

My rent and student loans weighed heavily on my mind. Beggars can‚Äôt be choosers and I would need at least six months of steady work just to get a handle on my debts.

But the moment my pen hit the paper, I felt it. A chill‚Äînot from the air, but from the room.

Like the store itself was watching me.

The old man didn‚Äôt smile or nod welcomingly‚Äîjust gave me a slow, unreadable nod. Without a word, he took the form and slid it into a filing cabinet that looked like it hadn‚Äôt been opened in decades.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be alone most of the time,‚Äù he said, locking the drawer with a sharp click. ‚ÄúStock shelves. Watch the front if anyone shows up. The cameras are old, but they work. And read this.‚Äù

He handed me a laminated sheet of yellow paper. The title read: Standard Protocols.

I unfolded the sheet carefully, the plastic sticky against my fingers. The list was typed in faded black letters:

*Standard Protocols*

**1) Never enter the basement.**

**2) If you hear footsteps or whispers after midnight, do not respond or investigate.**

**3) Keep all exterior doors except the front door locked at all times‚Äîno exceptions.**

**4) Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

**5) If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

**6) Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

**7) Do not use your phone to call anyone inside the store‚Äîsignals get scrambled.**

**8) If you feel watched, do not turn around or run. Walk calmly to the main office and lock the door until you hear footsteps walk away.**

**9) Under no circumstances touch the old cash register drawer at the front counter.**

**10) If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

I swallowed hard, eyes flicking back up to the old man.

‚ÄúSerious business,‚Äù I said, sarcasm creeping into my voice. ‚ÄúWhat is this, a hazing ritual?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt laugh. Didn‚Äôt even blink.

‚ÄúIf you want to live,‚Äù he said quietly, locking eyes with me, ‚Äúthen follow the rules.‚Äù

With that, he turned and left the office, glancing at his watch. ‚ÄúYour shift starts at 11 and ends at 6. Uniform‚Äôs in the back,‚Äù he added casually, as if he hadn‚Äôt just threatened my life.

I stood alone in the cold, empty store, the silence pressing down on me. The clock on the wall ticked loudly‚Äî10:30 p.m. Only thirty minutes until I had to fully commit to whatever this place was.

I headed toward the back room, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. The narrow hallway smelled faintly of old wood and something metallic I couldn‚Äôt place. When I found the uniform hanging on a rusty hook, I was relieved to see a thick jacket along with the usual store polo and pants.

Slipping into the jacket, I felt a small spark of comfort‚Äîlike armor against the unknown. But the uneasy feeling didn‚Äôt leave. The protocols, the warning, the way the old man looked at me... none of it added up to a normal night shift.

I checked the clock again‚Äî10:50 p.m.

Time to face the night.

The first hour passed quietly. Just me, the distant hum of the overhead lights, and the occasional whoosh of cars speeding down the highway outside‚Äînone of them stopping. They never did. Not here.

I stocked shelves like I was supposed to. The aisles were narrow and dim, and the inventory was‚Ä¶ strange. Too much of one thing, not enough of another. A dozen rows of canned green beans‚Äîbut barely any bread. No milk. No snacks. No delivery crates in the back, no expiration dates on the labels.

It was like the stock just appeared.

And just as I was placing the last can on the shelf, the lights flickered once.

I paused. Waited. They flickered again.

Then‚Äîsilence. That kind of thick silence that makes your skin itch.

And within that minute, the third flicker came.

This one lasted longer.

Too long.

The lights buzzed, stuttered, and dipped into full darkness for a breath‚Ä¶ then blinked back to life‚Äîdim, as if even the store itself was tired. Or‚Ä¶ resisting something.

I stood still. Frozen.

I didn‚Äôt know what I was waiting for‚Äîuntil I heard it.

A footstep. Just one. Then another. Slow. Heavy. Steady.

They weren‚Äôt coming fast, but they were coming.

Closer.

Whoever‚Äîor whatever‚Äîit was, it wasn‚Äôt in a rush. And it wasn‚Äôt trying to be quiet either.

My fingers had gone numb around the cart handle.

Rule Five.

**If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

My heartbeat climbed into my throat. I let go of the cart and began backing away, moving as quietly as I could across the scuffed tile.

The aisles around me seemed to shift, shelves towering like skeletons under those flickering lights. Their shadows twisted across the floor, long and jagged, like they could reach out and pull me in.

My eyes searched the store. I needed to hide. Fast.

That‚Äôs when the footsteps‚Äîonce slow and deliberate‚Äîbroke into a full sprint.

Whatever it was, it had stopped pretending.

I didn‚Äôt think. I just ran, heart hammering against my ribs, breath sharp in my throat as I tore down the aisle, desperate for someplace‚Äîanyplace‚Äîto hide.

The employee office. The door near the stockroom. I remembered it from earlier.

The footsteps were right behind me now‚Äîpounding, frantic, inhumanly fast.

I reached the door just as the lights cut out completely.

Pitch black.

I slammed into the wall, palms scraping across rough plaster as I fumbled for the doorknob. 5 full seconds. That‚Äôs how long I was blind, vulnerable, exposed‚Äîmy fingers clawing in the dark while whatever was chasing me gained ground.

I slipped inside the office, slammed the door shut, and turned the lock with a soft, deliberate click.

Darkness swallowed the room.

I didn‚Äôt dare turn on my phone‚Äôs light. Instead, I crouched low, pressing my back flat against the cold wall, every breath shaking in my chest. My heart thundered like a drumbeat in a silent theater.

I had no idea what time it was. No clue how long I‚Äôd have to stay hidden. I didn‚Äôt even know what was waiting out there in the dark.

I stayed there, frozen in the dark, listening.

At first, every creak made my chest seize. Every whisper of wind outside the walls sounded like breathing. But after a while... the silence settled.

And somewhere in that suffocating quiet, sleep crept in.

I must‚Äôve dozed off‚Äîjust for a moment.

Because I woke with a jolt as the overhead lights buzzed and flickered back on, casting a pale glow on the office floor.

I blinked hard, disoriented, then fumbled for my phone.

1:15 a.m.

‚ÄúDamn it,‚Äù I muttered, voice hoarse and cracked.

Whatever the hell was going on in this store‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt want any part of it.

But my train of thought was cut short by a soft ding from the front counter.

The bell.

The reception bell.

‚ÄúIs anyone there?‚Äù

A woman‚Äôs voice‚Äîgentle, but firm. Too calm for this hour.

I froze, every instinct screaming for me to stay put.

But Rule Four whispered in the back of my mind:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

But it wasn‚Äôt 2 a.m. yet. So, against every ounce of better judgment, I pushed myself to my feet, knees stiff, back aching, and slowly crept toward the register.

And that‚Äôs when I saw her.

She stood perfectly still at the counter, hands folded neatly in front of her.

Pale as frost. Skin like cracked porcelain pulled from the freezer.

Her hair spilled down in heavy, straight strands‚Äîgray and black, striped like static on an old analog screen.

She wore a long, dark coat. Perfectly still. Perfectly pressed.

And she was smiling.

Polite. Measured. Almost mechanical.

But her eyes didn‚Äôt smile.

They just stared.

Something about her felt‚Ä¶ wrong.

Not in the way people can be strange. In the way things pretend to be people.

She looked human.

Almost.

‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù I asked, my voice shakier than I wanted it to be.

Part of me was hoping she wouldn‚Äôt answer.

Her smile twitched‚Äîjust a little.

Too sharp. Too rehearsed.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said.

The word hung in the air, cold and smooth, like it had been repeated to a mirror one too many times.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for something.‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ kind of something?‚Äù

She tilted her head‚Äîslowly, mechanically‚Äîlike she wasn‚Äôt used to the weight of it.

‚ÄúDo you guys have meat?‚Äù she asked.

The word hit harder than it should‚Äôve.

Meat.

My blood ran cold. ‚ÄúMeat?,‚Äù I stammered. My voice thinned with each word.

She didn‚Äôt move. Didn‚Äôt blink.

Just stared.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you get a new shipment tonight?‚Äù she asked. Still calm. Still smiling.

And that‚Äôs when it hit me.

I had stocked meat tonight. Not in the aisle‚Äîbut in the freezer in the back room. Two vacuum-sealed packs. No label. No origin. Just sitting there when I opened the store‚Äôs delivery crate‚Ä¶Two silent, shrink-wrapped slabs of something.

And that was all the meat in the entire store.

Just those two.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said, barely louder than a whisper. ‚ÄúYou can find it in the back‚Ä¶in the frozen section.‚Äù

She looked at me.

Not for a second. Not for ten.

But for two full minutes.

She didn‚Äôt move.

Didn‚Äôt blink.

Just stood there, that same polite smile frozen across a face that didn‚Äôt breathe‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt breathe.

And then she said it.

‚ÄúThank you, Remi.‚Äù

My stomach dropped.

I never told her my name and my uniform didn't even have a nameplate.

But before I could react, she turned‚Äîslow, mechanical‚Äîand began walking down the back hallway.

That‚Äôs when I saw them.

Her feet.

They weren‚Äôt aligned with her body‚Äîangled just slightly toward the entrance, like she‚Äôd walked in backward‚Ä¶ and never fixed it.

As she walked away‚Äîthose misaligned feet shuffling against the linoleum‚ÄîI stayed frozen behind the counter, eyes locked on her until she disappeared into the back hallway.

Silence returned, thick and heavy.

I waited. One second. Then ten. Then a full minute.

No sound. No footsteps. No freezer door opening.

Just silence.

I should‚Äôve stayed behind the counter. I knew I should have. But something pulled at me. Curiosity. Stupidity. A need to know if those meat packs were even still there.

So I moved.

I moved down the hallway, one cautious step at a time.

The overhead lights buzzed softly‚Äîno flickering, just a steady, dull hum. Dimmer than before. Almost like they didn‚Äôt want to witness what was ahead.

The back room door stood open.

I hesitated at the threshold, heart hammering in my chest. The freezer was closed. Exactly how I‚Äôd left it. But she was gone. No trace of her. No footprints. No sound. Then I noticed it‚Äîone of the meat packets was missing. My stomach turned. And that‚Äôs when I heard it.

Ding. The soft chime of the front door bell. I bolted back toward the front, sneakers slipping on the tile. By the time I reached the counter, the door was already swinging shut with a gentle click. Outside? Empty parking lot. Inside? No one.

She was gone.

And I collapsed.

My knees gave out beneath me as panic took over, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might tear through my chest. My breath came in short gasps. Every instinct screamed Run, escape‚Äîget out.

But then I remembered Rule Six:

**Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

I stared at the front door like it might bite me.

I couldn‚Äôt leave.

I was trapped.

My hands were trembling. I needed to regroup‚Äîbreathe, think. I stumbled to the employee restroom and splashed cold water on my face, hoping it would shock my mind back into something resembling calm.

And that‚Äôs when I saw it.

In the mirror‚Äîwedged between the glass and the frame‚Äîwas a folded piece of paper. Just barely sticking out.

I pulled it free and opened it.

Four words. Bold, smeared, urgent:

DONT ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Ä¶‚Äù I whispered.

I stepped out of the bathroom in a daze, the note still clutched in my hand, and made my way back to the stockroom, trying to focus on something normal. Sorting. Stacking. Anything to distract myself from whatever this was.

That‚Äôs when I saw it.

A stairwell.

Half-hidden behind a row of unmarked boxes‚Äîsteps leading down. The hallway at the bottom stretched into a wide, dark tunnel that ended at a heavy iron door.

I felt my stomach twist.

The basement.

The one from Rule One:

**Never enter the basement.**

I shouldn‚Äôt have even looked. But I did. I peeked at the closed door.

And that‚Äôs when I heard it.

A voice. Muffled, desperate.

‚ÄúLet me out‚Ä¶‚Äù

Bang.

‚ÄúPlease!‚Äù another voice cried, pounding the door from the other side.

Then another. And another.

A rising chorus of fists and pleas. The sound of multiple people screaming‚Äîscreaming like their souls were on fire. Bloodcurdling, ragged, animalistic.

I turned and ran.

Bolted across the store, sprinting in the opposite direction, away from the basement, away from those voices. The farther I got, the quieter it became.

By the time I reached the far side of the store, it was silent again.

As if no one had ever spoken. As if no one had screamed. As if that door at the bottom of the stairs didn‚Äôt exist.

Then the bell at the reception desk rang.

Ding.

I froze.

Rule Four punched through my fog of fear:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

I slowly turned toward the clock hanging at the center of the store.

2:35 a.m.

Shit.

The bell rang again‚Äîharder this time. More impatient. I was directly across the store, hidden behind an aisle, far from the counter.

I crouched low and peeked through a gap between shelves.

And what I saw chilled me to the bone.

It wasn‚Äôt a person.

It was a creature‚Äîcrouched on all fours, nearly six feet tall and hunched. Its skin was hairless, stretched and raw like sun-scorched flesh. Its limbs were too long. Its fingers curled around the edge of the counter like claws.

And its face‚Ä¶

It had no eyes.

Just a gaping, unhinged jaw‚Äîso wide I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was screaming or simply unable to close.

It turned its head in my direction.

It didn‚Äôt need eyes to know.

Then‚Äî

The alarm went off.

Rule Ten echoed in my head like a warning bell:

**If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

The sirens wailed through the store‚Äîshrill and disorienting. I froze, forcing every muscle in my body to go still. I didn‚Äôt even dare to blink.

And then, beneath the screech of the alarm, came the voice.

Low and Crooked. Not human.

‚ÄúRemi‚Ä¶ in Aisle 6‚Ä¶ report to the reception.‚Äù

The voice repeated it again, warped and mechanical like it was being dragged through static.

‚ÄúRemi in Aisle 6‚Ä¶ come to the desk.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt move.

Didn‚Äôt breathe.

But my eyes‚Äîmy traitorous eyes‚Äîdrifted upward. And what I saw made my stomach drop through the floor.

Aisle 6.

I was in Aisle 6.

The second I realized it, I heard it move.

The thing near the desk snapped its head and launched forward‚Äîcharging down the store like it had been waiting for this cue. I didn‚Äôt wait. I didn't think. Just thought, ‚ÄúScrew this,‚Äù and ran.

The sirens only got louder. Harsher. Shadows started slithering out from between shelves, writhing like smoke with claws‚Äîreaching, grasping.

Every step I took felt like outrunning death itself.

The creature was behind me now, fast and wild, crashing through displays, howling without a mouth that ever closed. The shadows weren‚Äôt far behind‚Äîhungry, screaming through the noise.

I turned sharply toward the back hallway, toward the only place left: the stairwell.

I shoved the basement door open and slipped behind it at the last second, flattening myself behind the frame just as the creature skidded through.

It didn‚Äôt see me.

It didn‚Äôt even hesitate.

It charged down the stairs, dragging the shadows with it into the dark.

I slammed the door shut and twisted the handle.

Click.

It auto-locked. Thank God.

The pounding began immediately.

Fists‚Äîor claws‚Äîbeating against the other side. Screams‚Äîinhuman, layered, dozens of voices all at once‚Äîrose from beneath the floor like a chorus of the damned.

I collapsed beside the door, chest heaving, soaked in sweat. Every nerve in my body was fried, my thoughts scrambled and spinning.

I sat there for what felt like forever‚Äîmaybe an hour, maybe more‚Äîwhile the screams continued, until they faded into silence.

Eventually, I dragged myself to the breakroom.

No sirens. No voices. Just the hum of the fridge and the buzz of old lights.

I made myself coffee with shaking hands, not because I needed it‚Äîbecause I didn‚Äôt know what else to do.

I stared at the cup like it might offer answers to questions I was too tired‚Äîand too scared‚Äîto ask.

All I could think was:

God, I hope I never come back.

But even as the thought passed through me, I knew it was a lie.

The contract said one year.

One full year of this madness.

And there was no getting out.

By the time 6 a.m. rolled around, the store had returned to its usual, suffocating quiet‚Äîlike nothing had ever happened.

Then the bell above the front door jingled.

The old man walked in.

He paused when he saw me sitting in the breakroom. Alive.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still here?‚Äù he asked, genuinely surprised.

I looked up, dead-eyed. ‚ÄúNo shit, Sherlock.‚Äù

He let out a low chuckle, almost impressed. ‚ÄúTold you it wasn‚Äôt your average night shift. But I think this is the first time a newbie has actually made it through the first night.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot an average night shift doesn‚Äôt mean you die on the clock, old man,‚Äù I muttered.

He brushed off the criticism with a shrug. ‚ÄúYou followed the rules. That‚Äôs the only reason you‚Äôre still breathing.‚Äù

I swallowed hard, my voice barely steady. ‚ÄúCan I quit?‚Äù

His eyes didn‚Äôt even flicker. ‚ÄúNope. The contract says one year.‚Äù

I already knew that but it still stung hearing it out loud.

‚ÄúBut,‚Äù he added, casually, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a way out.‚Äù

I looked up slowly, wary.

‚ÄúYou can leave early,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúif you get promoted.‚Äù

That word stopped me cold.

DON‚ÄôT ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

The note in the bathroom flashed through my mind like a warning shot.

‚ÄúPromotion?‚Äù I asked, carefully measuring the word.

‚ÄúNot many make it that far,‚Äù he said, matter-of-fact. No emotion. No concern. Like he was stating the weather.

I didn‚Äôt respond. Just stared.

He slid an envelope across the table.

Inside: my paycheck.

$500.

For one night of surviving hell.

‚ÄúYou earned it,‚Äù he said, standing. ‚ÄúUniform rack‚Äôll have your size ready by tonight. See you at eleven.‚Äù

Then he walked out. Calm. Routine. Like we‚Äôd just finished another late shift at a grocery store.

But nothing about this job was normal.

And if ‚Äúnot many make it to the promotion,‚Äù that could only mean one thing.

Most don‚Äôt make it at all.

I pocketed the check and stepped out into the pale morning light.

The parking lot was still. Too still.

I walked to my car, every step echoing louder than it should‚Äôve. I slid into the driver‚Äôs seat, hands gripping the wheel‚Äîknuckles white.

I sat there for a long time, engine off, staring at the rising sun.

Thinking.

Wondering if I‚Äôd be stupid enough to come back tomorrow.

And knowing, deep down‚Ä¶

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and suitability of a 5 oz cup hinge on several crucial features. These range from the material composition and durability to the design aesthetics and ease of use. Understanding these features will empower you to make an informed decision that aligns with your specific needs and preferences.

**Material Composition**

The material used to construct a 5 oz cup substantially impacts its durability, heat resistance, aesthetics, and overall user experience. Common materials include ceramic, glass, stainless steel, and various types of plastic. Each material possesses unique properties that cater to different applications.

Ceramic cups offer excellent heat retention and are generally considered more aesthetically pleasing, but they can be more prone to chipping or breaking. Glass cups provide a clear view of the contents and are easy to clean, but can be delicate. Stainless steel options are incredibly durable and resistant to corrosion, making them ideal for outdoor use or for children. Plastic cups are lightweight, cost-effective, and frequently enough disposable, but may not be the most environmentally kind choice.

**Durability and Longevity**

A durable 5 oz cup is essential for everyday use,especially in homes or workplaces where they are handled frequently. Look for cups constructed from sturdy materials and resistant to common forms of damage from daily use. Glass cups should be tempered or made from borosilicate glass for increased resistance to shattering, while ceramic options should be high-fired to minimize chipping. The type of plastic should be BPA free and impact-resistant to prevent cracking or breaking.

Stainless steel cups are probably the most durable option for a 5oz cup. A double-walled stainless steel cup is less likely to suffer from damage and will maintain temperature longer than ceramic or glass.

**Design and Aesthetics**

The design of a 5 oz cup is crucial for both functional and aesthetic reasons. Ergonomically designed handles ensure a comfortable and secure grip, while the overall shape and style contribute to the presentation of beverages or food. Consider the aesthetic appeal and choose cups that complement your existing tableware or the overall ambiance of your event.

Variations in design include minimalist, modern, classic, and novelty styles, each catering to diverse tastes. Color choices range from neutral tones to vibrant hues,allowing for personalized expression.

**Heat resistance and Insulation**

For serving hot beverages like espresso or tea, heat resistance and insulation are critical.Cups made from materials like ceramic or double-walled stainless steel are excellent at retaining heat,keeping your drink warm for longer. Double-walled designs create an air gap that acts as an insulator,preventing the exterior of the cup from becoming too hot to handle.Glass cups, particularly those made from borosilicate glass, can also withstand high temperatures, but are generally not as effective at insulation as ceramic or stainless steel.Plastic cups are usually not recommended for very hot beverages due to potential melting or the leaching of chemicals.

**Ease of Cleaning**

Hygiene is paramount when it comes to cups, and ease of cleaning is a significant factor to consider. Look for cups with smooth, non-porous surfaces that are easy to rinse and wipe clean. Many materials, such as glass and stainless steel, are dishwasher-safe, offering added convenience.

Ceramic cups with intricate designs or textured surfaces may require more thorough cleaning to remove any residue. Plastic cups can stain easily and may require more effort to maintain a pristine appearance.disposable cups made of paper or compostable materials eliminate the need for cleaning altogether.

**Stackability and Storage**

If storage space is a constraint, consider cups that are designed for stackability. Stackable cups nest neatly within each other, minimizing the space required for storage. This feature is particularly useful in kitchens with limited cabinet space or in commercial settings where efficient storage is essential.Some cup designs have slightly tapered shapes that allow to easily stack and nest within each other, saving significant space than those with wider body shapes. Other designs often have handles that stick out greatly, thus impacting stackability.

## Core benefits

The right 5 oz cup can significantly enhance your drinking or dining experience,providing practical benefits and a touch of elegance. By focusing on the core benefits outlined below, you can select cups that effectively meet your individual needs and elevate your overall satisfaction.

**Enhanced Portion Control**

The 5 oz capacity is ideal for portion control, especially for those monitoring their intake of coffee, espresso, or desserts. Using these cups regularly helps maintain consistent serving sizes, aiding in weight management or dietary restrictions.For example, individuals following a specific diet plan might use a 5oz cup to control the quantity of soup, sauces or dips they are allowing themselves for a meal. Consistent use of the same sized cup helps them avoid overeating.

**convenient for Espresso and Small drinks**

Espresso shots and other small beverages are perfectly suited for 5 oz cups. The size allows for easy handling and a satisfying serving without consuming an excessive amount of liquid. This makes them ideal for coffee enthusiasts who enjoy multiple espresso shots throughout the day.

Smaller serving sizes means there's less leftover coffee to throw away, thus potentially saving money and minimizing waste.

**Versatility for Various Uses**

Beyond beverages, 5 oz cups can be used for a variety of other purposes, such as serving individual portions of appetizers, desserts, or condiments. their compact size makes them perfect for tasting events or small gatherings where multiple samples are offered.

They can also be used as measuring cups for small quantities of ingredients or as containers for small crafts or supplies.

**Easy to Handle and Store**

Their smaller size makes 5 oz cups easy to handle,even for children or individuals with limited grip strength. Additionally, they are easy to store in cabinets or on shelves, taking up minimal space compared to larger cups or mugs.

Many 5oz cups are designed to easily stack on top of one another helping to minimize the utilization of storage space and making them easy to access and grab when needed.

**Aesthetic Appeal with Wide Design Choice**

5 oz cups come in a wide variety of designs, colors, and materials, allowing you to choose options that match your personal style or the theme of your event. From elegant ceramic cups to modern glass options, there is a 5 oz cup to suit every taste.

## FAQs section

Navigating the world of 5 oz cups can raise several questions, particularly regarding their compatibility, usage, and maintenance. The following FAQs address common concerns, providing clarity and guidance to assist you in making an informed purchase.

**Are 5 oz cups suitable for commercial dishwashers?**
It depends on the material of the cup. Glass and stainless steel 5 oz cups are typically dishwasher safe and can withstand the high temperatures and harsh chemicals used in commercial dishwashers. However, ceramic cups, particularly those with delicate patterns or gold accents, may require handwashing to prevent damage. Plastic cups can also be dishwasher-safe provided that they are labelled in this very way, but they might potentially be more prone to scratching or warping over time.

**Can 5 oz cups be used in the microwave?**
Again, it depends on the material. Glass and ceramic cups are usually microwave-safe, making them convenient for reheating beverages. However, stainless steel cups should never be placed in the microwave as they can cause sparks and damage the appliance. Plastic cups should only be microwaved if they are specifically labelled as microwave-safe, or else they may melt or leach chemicals into the food. Always check the manufacturer's recommendations before microwaving any cup.

**What are the advantages of disposable 5 oz cups?**
Disposable 5 oz cups made from paper or compostable materials offer several advantages, especially for events or gatherings where convenience is a priority. They eliminate the need for washing up, saving time and effort. Compostable cups are also an environmentally friendly option, as they break down naturally after disposal.However, disposable cups are generally less durable and may not be suitable for serving hot beverages, as they can become flimsy or leak.**How do I choose the right 5 oz cup for espresso?**
When choosing cups for espresso,consider heat retention,size,and design. Ceramic cups are a popular choice for their excellent heat retention properties, keeping the espresso warm for longer.The size should be appropriate for a single or double shot of espresso, typically 2-3 ounces, leaving some room for crema. The design should also be considered, with many espresso cups featuring a thicker base to maintain temperature and a slightly flared rim to enhance the aroma.

1mdw510,https://www.reddit.com/r/Preply/comments/1mdw510/rant_about_teaching_children/,Rant about teaching children,"(I included a TLDR at the end because this is a bit long, sorry) I need to get this off my chest as I am at my wits end (advice will also be appreciated). I have been teaching for a year now and I have honestly been enjoying it so much, well, when it comes to adult students that is. When I created my profile I left the option in to teach young kids and in hindsight I was very naive. After some bad luck, I made the age range a bit higher (still teaching kids, just 12+) and did not struggle for a while, until now.

Through my experience, I've only directed my frustration to parents as they are the ones managing everything. I have found that there are two types: The parent that does not care and just gives the child their phone and does no surveillance at all, and the parent who sits next to the kid answering all the questions and breathing down their necks. All of them are so frustrating and I honestly cannot decide which one is worse.

I taught kids who would walk around the room making coffee for themselves, or were playing games on their Ipad while I'm trying to teach. These kids have the damn attention span of a rock sitting on a cliff in a rain storm, they're just rolling and falling everywhere without a care in the world. Listening to them has also exposed me to some severe brain rot, even in countries where I though western media wouldn't get them as much. There is no interesting lesson that I can make to capture their attention, there is no games I can make or even shows I can screenshot and have them talk about that would make them want to be present.

  
Then there's the micro-managing parent who has to sit directly next to their child in order for them to learn. They are so demanding. I am currently struggling with a parent like that, who in spite of acknowledging me as the teacher and the figure of knowledge, is constantly complaining about my teaching style. I can also clearly see how uncomfortable the child is, they are so reluctant to go into a conversation and enjoy the lesson because of their mother.

  
Why can't parents just be present and allow their children to learn comfortably? Why can't they sit in another room and listen, or just check the chats frequently and follow up with me? I am so tired.

TLDR: Parents are frustrating because they are either over bearing or not present at all. I want to rip my hair out. ",1,1753950842.0,Preply,3,1.0,False

The sign slapped against the glass door in the wind‚Äîbold, blocky letters that caught my eye mid-jog. I wasn‚Äôt out for exercise. I was trying to outrun the weight pressing on my chest: overdue rent, climbing student loans, and the hollow thud of every ‚ÄúWe regret to inform you‚Äù that kept piling into my inbox.

I had a degree. Engineering, no less. Supposed to be a golden ticket. Instead, it bought me rejection emails and a gnawing sense of failure.

But what stopped me cold was the pay: $55 per hour.

I blinked, wondering if I‚Äôd read it wrong. No experience required. Night shift. Immediate start.

It sounded too good to be true‚Äîwhich usually meant it was. But I stood there, heart racing, rereading it like the words might disappear if I looked away. My bank account had dipped below zero three days ago. I‚Äôd been living on canned soup and pride.

I looked down at the bottom of the flyer and read the address aloud under my breath:

3921 Old Pine Road, California.

I sighed. New town, no family, no friends‚Äîjust me, chasing some kind of fresh start in a place that didn‚Äôt know my name. It wasn‚Äôt ideal. But it was something. A flicker of hope. A paycheck.

By 10 p.m., I was there.

The store wasn‚Äôt anything spectacular. In fact, it was a lot smaller than I‚Äôd imagined.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I thought this would be, like, a giant Walmart,‚Äù I muttered to myself, taking in the dim, flickering sign saying ‚ÄúEvergroove‚Äù and the eerie silence around me. There were no other shops in sight‚Äîjust a lone building squatting on the side of a near-empty highway, swallowed by darkness on all sides.

It felt more like a rest stop for ghosts than a convenience store.

But I stepped forward anyway. As a woman, I knew the risk of walking into sketchy places alone. Every instinct told me to turn around. But when you‚Äôre desperate, even the strangest places can start to look like second chances.

The bell above the door gave a hollow jingle as I walked in. The store was dimly lit, aisles stretching ahead like crooked teeth in a too-wide grin. The reception counter was empty and the cold hit me like a slap.

Freezing.

Why was it so cold in the middle of July?

I rubbed my arms, breath fogging slightly as I looked around. That‚Äôs when I heard the soft shuffle of footsteps, followed by a creak.

Someone stepped out from the furthest aisle, his presence sudden and uncanny. A grizzled man with deep lines etched into his face like cracked leather.

‚ÄúWhat d‚Äôyou want?‚Äù he grunted, voice gravelly and dry.

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ I saw a sign. Are you guys hiring?‚Äù

He stared at me too long. Long enough to make me question if I‚Äôd said anything at all.

Then he gave a slow nod and turned his back.

‚ÄúFollow me,‚Äù he said, already turning down the narrow hallway. ‚ÄúHope you‚Äôre not scared of staying alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve done night shifts before.‚Äù I said recalling the call center night shift in high school, then retail during college. I was used to night shifts. They kept me away from home. From shouting matches. From silence I didn‚Äôt know how to fill.

The old man moved faster than I expected, his steps brisk and sure, like he didn‚Äôt have time to waste.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt your average night shift,‚Äù he muttered, glancing back at me with a look I couldn‚Äôt quite read. Like he was sizing me up‚Ä¶ or reconsidering something.

We reached a cramped employee office tucked behind a heavy door. He rummaged through a drawer, pulled out a clipboard, and slapped a yellowed form onto the desk.

‚ÄúFill this out,‚Äù he said, sliding the clipboard toward me. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre good to start, the shift begins tonight.‚Äù

He paused‚Äîjust long enough that I wondered if he was waiting for me to back out. But I didn‚Äôt.

I picked up the pen and skimmed the contract, the paper cold and stiff beneath my fingers. One line snagged my attention like a fishhook, Minimum term: One year. No early termination.

Maybe they didn‚Äôt want employees quitting after making a decent paycheck. Still, something about it felt off.

My rent and student loans weighed heavily on my mind. Beggars can‚Äôt be choosers and I would need at least six months of steady work just to get a handle on my debts.

But the moment my pen hit the paper, I felt it. A chill‚Äînot from the air, but from the room.

Like the store itself was watching me.

The old man didn‚Äôt smile or nod welcomingly‚Äîjust gave me a slow, unreadable nod. Without a word, he took the form and slid it into a filing cabinet that looked like it hadn‚Äôt been opened in decades.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be alone most of the time,‚Äù he said, locking the drawer with a sharp click. ‚ÄúStock shelves. Watch the front if anyone shows up. The cameras are old, but they work. And read this.‚Äù

He handed me a laminated sheet of yellow paper. The title read: Standard Protocols.

I unfolded the sheet carefully, the plastic sticky against my fingers. The list was typed in faded black letters:

*Standard Protocols*

**1) Never enter the basement.**

**2) If you hear footsteps or whispers after midnight, do not respond or investigate.**

**3) Keep all exterior doors except the front door locked at all times‚Äîno exceptions.**

**4) Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

**5) If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

**6) Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

**7) Do not use your phone to call anyone inside the store‚Äîsignals get scrambled.**

**8) If you feel watched, do not turn around or run. Walk calmly to the main office and lock the door until you hear footsteps walk away.**

**9) Under no circumstances touch the old cash register drawer at the front counter.**

**10) If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

I swallowed hard, eyes flicking back up to the old man.

‚ÄúSerious business,‚Äù I said, sarcasm creeping into my voice. ‚ÄúWhat is this, a hazing ritual?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt laugh. Didn‚Äôt even blink.

‚ÄúIf you want to live,‚Äù he said quietly, locking eyes with me, ‚Äúthen follow the rules.‚Äù

With that, he turned and left the office, glancing at his watch. ‚ÄúYour shift starts at 11 and ends at 6. Uniform‚Äôs in the back,‚Äù he added casually, as if he hadn‚Äôt just threatened my life.

I stood alone in the cold, empty store, the silence pressing down on me. The clock on the wall ticked loudly‚Äî10:30 p.m. Only thirty minutes until I had to fully commit to whatever this place was.

I headed toward the back room, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. The narrow hallway smelled faintly of old wood and something metallic I couldn‚Äôt place. When I found the uniform hanging on a rusty hook, I was relieved to see a thick jacket along with the usual store polo and pants.

Slipping into the jacket, I felt a small spark of comfort‚Äîlike armor against the unknown. But the uneasy feeling didn‚Äôt leave. The protocols, the warning, the way the old man looked at me... none of it added up to a normal night shift.

I checked the clock again‚Äî10:50 p.m.

Time to face the night.

The first hour passed quietly. Just me, the distant hum of the overhead lights, and the occasional whoosh of cars speeding down the highway outside‚Äînone of them stopping. They never did. Not here.

I stocked shelves like I was supposed to. The aisles were narrow and dim, and the inventory was‚Ä¶ strange. Too much of one thing, not enough of another. A dozen rows of canned green beans‚Äîbut barely any bread. No milk. No snacks. No delivery crates in the back, no expiration dates on the labels.

It was like the stock just appeared.

And just as I was placing the last can on the shelf, the lights flickered once.

I paused. Waited. They flickered again.

Then‚Äîsilence. That kind of thick silence that makes your skin itch.

And within that minute, the third flicker came.

This one lasted longer.

Too long.

The lights buzzed, stuttered, and dipped into full darkness for a breath‚Ä¶ then blinked back to life‚Äîdim, as if even the store itself was tired. Or‚Ä¶ resisting something.

I stood still. Frozen.

I didn‚Äôt know what I was waiting for‚Äîuntil I heard it.

A footstep. Just one. Then another. Slow. Heavy. Steady.

They weren‚Äôt coming fast, but they were coming.

Closer.

Whoever‚Äîor whatever‚Äîit was, it wasn‚Äôt in a rush. And it wasn‚Äôt trying to be quiet either.

My fingers had gone numb around the cart handle.

Rule Five.

**If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

My heartbeat climbed into my throat. I let go of the cart and began backing away, moving as quietly as I could across the scuffed tile.

The aisles around me seemed to shift, shelves towering like skeletons under those flickering lights. Their shadows twisted across the floor, long and jagged, like they could reach out and pull me in.

My eyes searched the store. I needed to hide. Fast.

That‚Äôs when the footsteps‚Äîonce slow and deliberate‚Äîbroke into a full sprint.

Whatever it was, it had stopped pretending.

I didn‚Äôt think. I just ran, heart hammering against my ribs, breath sharp in my throat as I tore down the aisle, desperate for someplace‚Äîanyplace‚Äîto hide.

The employee office. The door near the stockroom. I remembered it from earlier.

The footsteps were right behind me now‚Äîpounding, frantic, inhumanly fast.

I reached the door just as the lights cut out completely.

Pitch black.

I slammed into the wall, palms scraping across rough plaster as I fumbled for the doorknob. 5 full seconds. That‚Äôs how long I was blind, vulnerable, exposed‚Äîmy fingers clawing in the dark while whatever was chasing me gained ground.

I slipped inside the office, slammed the door shut, and turned the lock with a soft, deliberate click.

Darkness swallowed the room.

I didn‚Äôt dare turn on my phone‚Äôs light. Instead, I crouched low, pressing my back flat against the cold wall, every breath shaking in my chest. My heart thundered like a drumbeat in a silent theater.

I had no idea what time it was. No clue how long I‚Äôd have to stay hidden. I didn‚Äôt even know what was waiting out there in the dark.

I stayed there, frozen in the dark, listening.

At first, every creak made my chest seize. Every whisper of wind outside the walls sounded like breathing. But after a while... the silence settled.

And somewhere in that suffocating quiet, sleep crept in.

I must‚Äôve dozed off‚Äîjust for a moment.

Because I woke with a jolt as the overhead lights buzzed and flickered back on, casting a pale glow on the office floor.

I blinked hard, disoriented, then fumbled for my phone.

1:15 a.m.

‚ÄúDamn it,‚Äù I muttered, voice hoarse and cracked.

Whatever the hell was going on in this store‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt want any part of it.

But my train of thought was cut short by a soft ding from the front counter.

The bell.

The reception bell.

‚ÄúIs anyone there?‚Äù

A woman‚Äôs voice‚Äîgentle, but firm. Too calm for this hour.

I froze, every instinct screaming for me to stay put.

But Rule Four whispered in the back of my mind:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

But it wasn‚Äôt 2 a.m. yet. So, against every ounce of better judgment, I pushed myself to my feet, knees stiff, back aching, and slowly crept toward the register.

And that‚Äôs when I saw her.

She stood perfectly still at the counter, hands folded neatly in front of her.

Pale as frost. Skin like cracked porcelain pulled from the freezer.

Her hair spilled down in heavy, straight strands‚Äîgray and black, striped like static on an old analog screen.

She wore a long, dark coat. Perfectly still. Perfectly pressed.

And she was smiling.

Polite. Measured. Almost mechanical.

But her eyes didn‚Äôt smile.

They just stared.

Something about her felt‚Ä¶ wrong.

Not in the way people can be strange. In the way things pretend to be people.

She looked human.

Almost.

‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù I asked, my voice shakier than I wanted it to be.

Part of me was hoping she wouldn‚Äôt answer.

Her smile twitched‚Äîjust a little.

Too sharp. Too rehearsed.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said.

The word hung in the air, cold and smooth, like it had been repeated to a mirror one too many times.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for something.‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ kind of something?‚Äù

She tilted her head‚Äîslowly, mechanically‚Äîlike she wasn‚Äôt used to the weight of it.

‚ÄúDo you guys have meat?‚Äù she asked.

The word hit harder than it should‚Äôve.

Meat.

My blood ran cold. ‚ÄúMeat?,‚Äù I stammered. My voice thinned with each word.

She didn‚Äôt move. Didn‚Äôt blink.

Just stared.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you get a new shipment tonight?‚Äù she asked. Still calm. Still smiling.

And that‚Äôs when it hit me.

I had stocked meat tonight. Not in the aisle‚Äîbut in the freezer in the back room. Two vacuum-sealed packs. No label. No origin. Just sitting there when I opened the store‚Äôs delivery crate‚Ä¶Two silent, shrink-wrapped slabs of something.

And that was all the meat in the entire store.

Just those two.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said, barely louder than a whisper. ‚ÄúYou can find it in the back‚Ä¶in the frozen section.‚Äù

She looked at me.

Not for a second. Not for ten.

But for two full minutes.

She didn‚Äôt move.

Didn‚Äôt blink.

Just stood there, that same polite smile frozen across a face that didn‚Äôt breathe‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt breathe.

And then she said it.

‚ÄúThank you, Remi.‚Äù

My stomach dropped.

I never told her my name and my uniform didn't even have a nameplate.

But before I could react, she turned‚Äîslow, mechanical‚Äîand began walking down the back hallway.

That‚Äôs when I saw them.

Her feet.

They weren‚Äôt aligned with her body‚Äîangled just slightly toward the entrance, like she‚Äôd walked in backward‚Ä¶ and never fixed it.

As she walked away‚Äîthose misaligned feet shuffling against the linoleum‚ÄîI stayed frozen behind the counter, eyes locked on her until she disappeared into the back hallway.

Silence returned, thick and heavy.

I waited. One second. Then ten. Then a full minute.

No sound. No footsteps. No freezer door opening.

Just silence.

I should‚Äôve stayed behind the counter. I knew I should have. But something pulled at me. Curiosity. Stupidity. A need to know if those meat packs were even still there.

So I moved.

I moved down the hallway, one cautious step at a time.

The overhead lights buzzed softly‚Äîno flickering, just a steady, dull hum. Dimmer than before. Almost like they didn‚Äôt want to witness what was ahead.

The back room door stood open.

I hesitated at the threshold, heart hammering in my chest. The freezer was closed. Exactly how I‚Äôd left it. But she was gone. No trace of her. No footprints. No sound. Then I noticed it‚Äîone of the meat packets was missing. My stomach turned. And that‚Äôs when I heard it.

Ding. The soft chime of the front door bell. I bolted back toward the front, sneakers slipping on the tile. By the time I reached the counter, the door was already swinging shut with a gentle click. Outside? Empty parking lot. Inside? No one.

She was gone.

And I collapsed.

My knees gave out beneath me as panic took over, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might tear through my chest. My breath came in short gasps. Every instinct screamed Run, escape‚Äîget out.

But then I remembered Rule Six:

**Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

I stared at the front door like it might bite me.

I couldn‚Äôt leave.

I was trapped.

My hands were trembling. I needed to regroup‚Äîbreathe, think. I stumbled to the employee restroom and splashed cold water on my face, hoping it would shock my mind back into something resembling calm.

And that‚Äôs when I saw it.

In the mirror‚Äîwedged between the glass and the frame‚Äîwas a folded piece of paper. Just barely sticking out.

I pulled it free and opened it.

Four words. Bold, smeared, urgent:

DONT ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Ä¶‚Äù I whispered.

I stepped out of the bathroom in a daze, the note still clutched in my hand, and made my way back to the stockroom, trying to focus on something normal. Sorting. Stacking. Anything to distract myself from whatever this was.

That‚Äôs when I saw it.

A stairwell.

Half-hidden behind a row of unmarked boxes‚Äîsteps leading down. The hallway at the bottom stretched into a wide, dark tunnel that ended at a heavy iron door.

I felt my stomach twist.

The basement.

The one from Rule One:

**Never enter the basement.**

I shouldn‚Äôt have even looked. But I did. I peeked at the closed door.

And that‚Äôs when I heard it.

A voice. Muffled, desperate.

‚ÄúLet me out‚Ä¶‚Äù

Bang.

‚ÄúPlease!‚Äù another voice cried, pounding the door from the other side.

Then another. And another.

A rising chorus of fists and pleas. The sound of multiple people screaming‚Äîscreaming like their souls were on fire. Bloodcurdling, ragged, animalistic.

I turned and ran.

Bolted across the store, sprinting in the opposite direction, away from the basement, away from those voices. The farther I got, the quieter it became.

By the time I reached the far side of the store, it was silent again.

As if no one had ever spoken. As if no one had screamed. As if that door at the bottom of the stairs didn‚Äôt exist.

Then the bell at the reception desk rang.

Ding.

I froze.

Rule Four punched through my fog of fear:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

I slowly turned toward the clock hanging at the center of the store.

2:35 a.m.

Shit.

The bell rang again‚Äîharder this time. More impatient. I was directly across the store, hidden behind an aisle, far from the counter.

I crouched low and peeked through a gap between shelves.

And what I saw chilled me to the bone.

It wasn‚Äôt a person.

It was a creature‚Äîcrouched on all fours, nearly six feet tall and hunched. Its skin was hairless, stretched and raw like sun-scorched flesh. Its limbs were too long. Its fingers curled around the edge of the counter like claws.

And its face‚Ä¶

It had no eyes.

Just a gaping, unhinged jaw‚Äîso wide I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was screaming or simply unable to close.

It turned its head in my direction.

It didn‚Äôt need eyes to know.

Then‚Äî

The alarm went off.

Rule Ten echoed in my head like a warning bell:

**If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

The sirens wailed through the store‚Äîshrill and disorienting. I froze, forcing every muscle in my body to go still. I didn‚Äôt even dare to blink.

And then, beneath the screech of the alarm, came the voice.

Low and Crooked. Not human.

‚ÄúRemi‚Ä¶ in Aisle 6‚Ä¶ report to the reception.‚Äù

The voice repeated it again, warped and mechanical like it was being dragged through static.

‚ÄúRemi in Aisle 6‚Ä¶ come to the desk.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt move.

Didn‚Äôt breathe.

But my eyes‚Äîmy traitorous eyes‚Äîdrifted upward. And what I saw made my stomach drop through the floor.

Aisle 6.

I was in Aisle 6.

The second I realized it, I heard it move.

The thing near the desk snapped its head and launched forward‚Äîcharging down the store like it had been waiting for this cue. I didn‚Äôt wait. I didn't think. Just thought, ‚ÄúScrew this,‚Äù and ran.

The sirens only got louder. Harsher. Shadows started slithering out from between shelves, writhing like smoke with claws‚Äîreaching, grasping.

Every step I took felt like outrunning death itself.

The creature was behind me now, fast and wild, crashing through displays, howling without a mouth that ever closed. The shadows weren‚Äôt far behind‚Äîhungry, screaming through the noise.

I turned sharply toward the back hallway, toward the only place left: the stairwell.

I shoved the basement door open and slipped behind it at the last second, flattening myself behind the frame just as the creature skidded through.

It didn‚Äôt see me.

It didn‚Äôt even hesitate.

It charged down the stairs, dragging the shadows with it into the dark.

I slammed the door shut and twisted the handle.

Click.

It auto-locked. Thank God.

The pounding began immediately.

Fists‚Äîor claws‚Äîbeating against the other side. Screams‚Äîinhuman, layered, dozens of voices all at once‚Äîrose from beneath the floor like a chorus of the damned.

I collapsed beside the door, chest heaving, soaked in sweat. Every nerve in my body was fried, my thoughts scrambled and spinning.

I sat there for what felt like forever‚Äîmaybe an hour, maybe more‚Äîwhile the screams continued, until they faded into silence.

Eventually, I dragged myself to the breakroom.

No sirens. No voices. Just the hum of the fridge and the buzz of old lights.

I made myself coffee with shaking hands, not because I needed it‚Äîbecause I didn‚Äôt know what else to do.

I stared at the cup like it might offer answers to questions I was too tired‚Äîand too scared‚Äîto ask.

All I could think was:

God, I hope I never come back.

But even as the thought passed through me, I knew it was a lie.

The contract said one year.

One full year of this madness.

And there was no getting out.

By the time 6 a.m. rolled around, the store had returned to its usual, suffocating quiet‚Äîlike nothing had ever happened.

Then the bell above the front door jingled.

The old man walked in.

He paused when he saw me sitting in the breakroom. Alive.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still here?‚Äù he asked, genuinely surprised.

I looked up, dead-eyed. ‚ÄúNo shit, Sherlock.‚Äù

He let out a low chuckle, almost impressed. ‚ÄúTold you it wasn‚Äôt your average night shift. But I think this is the first time a newbie has actually made it through the first night.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot an average night shift doesn‚Äôt mean you die on the clock, old man,‚Äù I muttered.

He brushed off the criticism with a shrug. ‚ÄúYou followed the rules. That‚Äôs the only reason you‚Äôre still breathing.‚Äù

I swallowed hard, my voice barely steady. ‚ÄúCan I quit?‚Äù

His eyes didn‚Äôt even flicker. ‚ÄúNope. The contract says one year.‚Äù

I already knew that but it still stung hearing it out loud.

‚ÄúBut,‚Äù he added, casually, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a way out.‚Äù

I looked up slowly, wary.

‚ÄúYou can leave early,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúif you get promoted.‚Äù

That word stopped me cold.

DON‚ÄôT ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

The note in the bathroom flashed through my mind like a warning shot.

‚ÄúPromotion?‚Äù I asked, carefully measuring the word.

‚ÄúNot many make it that far,‚Äù he said, matter-of-fact. No emotion. No concern. Like he was stating the weather.

I didn‚Äôt respond. Just stared.

He slid an envelope across the table.

Inside: my paycheck.

$500.

For one night of surviving hell.

‚ÄúYou earned it,‚Äù he said, standing. ‚ÄúUniform rack‚Äôll have your size ready by tonight. See you at eleven.‚Äù

Then he walked out. Calm. Routine. Like we‚Äôd just finished another late shift at a grocery store.

But nothing about this job was normal.

And if ‚Äúnot many make it to the promotion,‚Äù that could only mean one thing.

Most don‚Äôt make it at all.

I pocketed the check and stepped out into the pale morning light.

The parking lot was still. Too still.

I walked to my car, every step echoing louder than it should‚Äôve. I slid into the driver‚Äôs seat, hands gripping the wheel‚Äîknuckles white.

I sat there for a long time, engine off, staring at the rising sun.

Thinking.

Wondering if I‚Äôd be stupid enough to come back tomorrow.

And knowing, deep down‚Ä¶

I'm in Euro time zones and atarting my work day at 2pm. Trying to fit on vacation on between. Last night I thought I had an aura. This morning it feels like 2 more. 



I immediately ceased the walking around in the morning on the city took my vimpat in full unlike breaking it apart over 2 hours (feels like hot flashes of not).


After breakfast, I took some valium, skipped coffee and am laying in the hotel room. The auras are the type where I read something that is generally a non-issue, but for whatever reason my brain interprets it as panicy and I start to have those adrenaline rush and one minute panic feelings. I call it stupid anxiety. Because most people would think that it's stupid that you work up and anxious and nervous feeling over it. 



I do have some weed on me but I really just use that right before bed and since diagnosis I have pretty much curtailed any daytime use. Overall, I think more substances probably isn't the way to go, but given the circumstance, would you have some just to knock you out or stick with the less substances mindset? 



It's like a terrible circle of anxiety. I'm really afraid that I'm going to mess up the ""vacation"" for everyone else. And then the whole anxiety over nothing thing. 



Now that I'm laying in the hotel room, free from stimuli. I am feeling better and have not felt an aura through the duration of this. Maybe getting to the vimpat earlier and taking Valium is going to put a stop to it. But I do have the Valtocos ready and in a accessible place in case something happens. But back to the messing of the day for everyone else. Unfortunately, valtococo only works when someone is here to *rescue you"". I only have TC's And my spouse has not learned yet that you don't need hospital assistance for everyone but more so for any that persist over 5 minutes. However, they are not comfortable with this explanation. Sorry to mix the rant in with the advice question.

The sign slapped against the glass door in the wind‚Äîbold, blocky letters that caught my eye mid-jog. I wasn‚Äôt out for exercise. I was trying to outrun the weight pressing on my chest: overdue rent, climbing student loans, and the hollow thud of every ‚ÄúWe regret to inform you‚Äù that kept piling into my inbox.

I had a degree. Engineering, no less. Supposed to be a golden ticket. Instead, it bought me rejection emails and a gnawing sense of failure.

But what stopped me cold was the pay: $55 per hour.

I blinked, wondering if I‚Äôd read it wrong. No experience required. Night shift. Immediate start.

It sounded too good to be true‚Äîwhich usually meant it was. But I stood there, heart racing, rereading it like the words might disappear if I looked away. My bank account had dipped below zero three days ago. I‚Äôd been living on canned soup and pride.

I looked down at the bottom of the flyer and read the address aloud under my breath:

3921 Old Pine Road, California.

I sighed. New town, no family, no friends‚Äîjust me, chasing some kind of fresh start in a place that didn‚Äôt know my name. It wasn‚Äôt ideal. But it was something. A flicker of hope. A paycheck.

By 10 p.m., I was there.

The store wasn‚Äôt anything spectacular. In fact, it was a lot smaller than I‚Äôd imagined.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I thought this would be, like, a giant Walmart,‚Äù I muttered to myself, taking in the dim, flickering sign saying ‚ÄúEvergroove‚Äù and the eerie silence around me. There were no other shops in sight‚Äîjust a lone building squatting on the side of a near-empty highway, swallowed by darkness on all sides.

It felt more like a rest stop for ghosts than a convenience store.

But I stepped forward anyway. As a woman, I knew the risk of walking into sketchy places alone. Every instinct told me to turn around. But when you‚Äôre desperate, even the strangest places can start to look like second chances.

The bell above the door gave a hollow jingle as I walked in. The store was dimly lit, aisles stretching ahead like crooked teeth in a too-wide grin. The reception counter was empty and the cold hit me like a slap.

Freezing.

Why was it so cold in the middle of July?

I rubbed my arms, breath fogging slightly as I looked around. That‚Äôs when I heard the soft shuffle of footsteps, followed by a creak.

Someone stepped out from the furthest aisle, his presence sudden and uncanny. A grizzled man with deep lines etched into his face like cracked leather.

‚ÄúWhat d‚Äôyou want?‚Äù he grunted, voice gravelly and dry.

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ I saw a sign. Are you guys hiring?‚Äù

He stared at me too long. Long enough to make me question if I‚Äôd said anything at all.

Then he gave a slow nod and turned his back.

‚ÄúFollow me,‚Äù he said, already turning down the narrow hallway. ‚ÄúHope you‚Äôre not scared of staying alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve done night shifts before.‚Äù I said recalling the call center night shift in high school, then retail during college. I was used to night shifts. They kept me away from home. From shouting matches. From silence I didn‚Äôt know how to fill.

The old man moved faster than I expected, his steps brisk and sure, like he didn‚Äôt have time to waste.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt your average night shift,‚Äù he muttered, glancing back at me with a look I couldn‚Äôt quite read. Like he was sizing me up‚Ä¶ or reconsidering something.

We reached a cramped employee office tucked behind a heavy door. He rummaged through a drawer, pulled out a clipboard, and slapped a yellowed form onto the desk.

‚ÄúFill this out,‚Äù he said, sliding the clipboard toward me. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre good to start, the shift begins tonight.‚Äù

He paused‚Äîjust long enough that I wondered if he was waiting for me to back out. But I didn‚Äôt.

I picked up the pen and skimmed the contract, the paper cold and stiff beneath my fingers. One line snagged my attention like a fishhook, Minimum term: One year. No early termination.

Maybe they didn‚Äôt want employees quitting after making a decent paycheck. Still, something about it felt off.

My rent and student loans weighed heavily on my mind. Beggars can‚Äôt be choosers and I would need at least six months of steady work just to get a handle on my debts.

But the moment my pen hit the paper, I felt it. A chill‚Äînot from the air, but from the room.

Like the store itself was watching me.

The old man didn‚Äôt smile or nod welcomingly‚Äîjust gave me a slow, unreadable nod. Without a word, he took the form and slid it into a filing cabinet that looked like it hadn‚Äôt been opened in decades.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be alone most of the time,‚Äù he said, locking the drawer with a sharp click. ‚ÄúStock shelves. Watch the front if anyone shows up. The cameras are old, but they work. And read this.‚Äù

He handed me a laminated sheet of yellow paper. The title read: Standard Protocols.

I unfolded the sheet carefully, the plastic sticky against my fingers. The list was typed in faded black letters:

*Standard Protocols*

**1) Never enter the basement.**

**2) If you hear footsteps or whispers after midnight, do not respond or investigate.**

**3) Keep all exterior doors except the front door locked at all times‚Äîno exceptions.**

**4) Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

**5) If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

**6) Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

**7) Do not use your phone to call anyone inside the store‚Äîsignals get scrambled.**

**8) If you feel watched, do not turn around or run. Walk calmly to the main office and lock the door until you hear footsteps walk away.**

**9) Under no circumstances touch the old cash register drawer at the front counter.**

**10) If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

I swallowed hard, eyes flicking back up to the old man.

‚ÄúSerious business,‚Äù I said, sarcasm creeping into my voice. ‚ÄúWhat is this, a hazing ritual?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt laugh. Didn‚Äôt even blink.

‚ÄúIf you want to live,‚Äù he said quietly, locking eyes with me, ‚Äúthen follow the rules.‚Äù

With that, he turned and left the office, glancing at his watch. ‚ÄúYour shift starts at 11 and ends at 6. Uniform‚Äôs in the back,‚Äù he added casually, as if he hadn‚Äôt just threatened my life.

I stood alone in the cold, empty store, the silence pressing down on me. The clock on the wall ticked loudly‚Äî10:30 p.m. Only thirty minutes until I had to fully commit to whatever this place was.

I headed toward the back room, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. The narrow hallway smelled faintly of old wood and something metallic I couldn‚Äôt place. When I found the uniform hanging on a rusty hook, I was relieved to see a thick jacket along with the usual store polo and pants.

Slipping into the jacket, I felt a small spark of comfort‚Äîlike armor against the unknown. But the uneasy feeling didn‚Äôt leave. The protocols, the warning, the way the old man looked at me... none of it added up to a normal night shift.

I checked the clock again‚Äî10:50 p.m.

Time to face the night.

The first hour passed quietly. Just me, the distant hum of the overhead lights, and the occasional whoosh of cars speeding down the highway outside‚Äînone of them stopping. They never did. Not here.

I stocked shelves like I was supposed to. The aisles were narrow and dim, and the inventory was‚Ä¶ strange. Too much of one thing, not enough of another. A dozen rows of canned green beans‚Äîbut barely any bread. No milk. No snacks. No delivery crates in the back, no expiration dates on the labels.

It was like the stock just appeared.

And just as I was placing the last can on the shelf, the lights flickered once.

I paused. Waited. They flickered again.

Then‚Äîsilence. That kind of thick silence that makes your skin itch.

And within that minute, the third flicker came.

This one lasted longer.

Too long.

The lights buzzed, stuttered, and dipped into full darkness for a breath‚Ä¶ then blinked back to life‚Äîdim, as if even the store itself was tired. Or‚Ä¶ resisting something.

I stood still. Frozen.

I didn‚Äôt know what I was waiting for‚Äîuntil I heard it.

A footstep. Just one. Then another. Slow. Heavy. Steady.

They weren‚Äôt coming fast, but they were coming.

Closer.

Whoever‚Äîor whatever‚Äîit was, it wasn‚Äôt in a rush. And it wasn‚Äôt trying to be quiet either.

My fingers had gone numb around the cart handle.

Rule Five.

**If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

My heartbeat climbed into my throat. I let go of the cart and began backing away, moving as quietly as I could across the scuffed tile.

The aisles around me seemed to shift, shelves towering like skeletons under those flickering lights. Their shadows twisted across the floor, long and jagged, like they could reach out and pull me in.

My eyes searched the store. I needed to hide. Fast.

That‚Äôs when the footsteps‚Äîonce slow and deliberate‚Äîbroke into a full sprint.

Whatever it was, it had stopped pretending.

I didn‚Äôt think. I just ran, heart hammering against my ribs, breath sharp in my throat as I tore down the aisle, desperate for someplace‚Äîanyplace‚Äîto hide.

The employee office. The door near the stockroom. I remembered it from earlier.

The footsteps were right behind me now‚Äîpounding, frantic, inhumanly fast.

I reached the door just as the lights cut out completely.

Pitch black.

I slammed into the wall, palms scraping across rough plaster as I fumbled for the doorknob. 5 full seconds. That‚Äôs how long I was blind, vulnerable, exposed‚Äîmy fingers clawing in the dark while whatever was chasing me gained ground.

I slipped inside the office, slammed the door shut, and turned the lock with a soft, deliberate click.

Darkness swallowed the room.

I didn‚Äôt dare turn on my phone‚Äôs light. Instead, I crouched low, pressing my back flat against the cold wall, every breath shaking in my chest. My heart thundered like a drumbeat in a silent theater.

I had no idea what time it was. No clue how long I‚Äôd have to stay hidden. I didn‚Äôt even know what was waiting out there in the dark.

I stayed there, frozen in the dark, listening.

At first, every creak made my chest seize. Every whisper of wind outside the walls sounded like breathing. But after a while... the silence settled.

And somewhere in that suffocating quiet, sleep crept in.

I must‚Äôve dozed off‚Äîjust for a moment.

Because I woke with a jolt as the overhead lights buzzed and flickered back on, casting a pale glow on the office floor.

I blinked hard, disoriented, then fumbled for my phone.

1:15 a.m.

‚ÄúDamn it,‚Äù I muttered, voice hoarse and cracked.

Whatever the hell was going on in this store‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt want any part of it.

But my train of thought was cut short by a soft ding from the front counter.

The bell.

The reception bell.

‚ÄúIs anyone there?‚Äù

A woman‚Äôs voice‚Äîgentle, but firm. Too calm for this hour.

I froze, every instinct screaming for me to stay put.

But Rule Four whispered in the back of my mind:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

But it wasn‚Äôt 2 a.m. yet. So, against every ounce of better judgment, I pushed myself to my feet, knees stiff, back aching, and slowly crept toward the register.

And that‚Äôs when I saw her.

She stood perfectly still at the counter, hands folded neatly in front of her.

Pale as frost. Skin like cracked porcelain pulled from the freezer.

Her hair spilled down in heavy, straight strands‚Äîgray and black, striped like static on an old analog screen.

She wore a long, dark coat. Perfectly still. Perfectly pressed.

And she was smiling.

Polite. Measured. Almost mechanical.

But her eyes didn‚Äôt smile.

They just stared.

Something about her felt‚Ä¶ wrong.

Not in the way people can be strange. In the way things pretend to be people.

She looked human.

Almost.

‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù I asked, my voice shakier than I wanted it to be.

Part of me was hoping she wouldn‚Äôt answer.

Her smile twitched‚Äîjust a little.

Too sharp. Too rehearsed.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said.

The word hung in the air, cold and smooth, like it had been repeated to a mirror one too many times.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for something.‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ kind of something?‚Äù

She tilted her head‚Äîslowly, mechanically‚Äîlike she wasn‚Äôt used to the weight of it.

‚ÄúDo you guys have meat?‚Äù she asked.

The word hit harder than it should‚Äôve.

Meat.

My blood ran cold. ‚ÄúMeat?,‚Äù I stammered. My voice thinned with each word.

She didn‚Äôt move. Didn‚Äôt blink.

Just stared.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you get a new shipment tonight?‚Äù she asked. Still calm. Still smiling.

And that‚Äôs when it hit me.

I had stocked meat tonight. Not in the aisle‚Äîbut in the freezer in the back room. Two vacuum-sealed packs. No label. No origin. Just sitting there when I opened the store‚Äôs delivery crate‚Ä¶Two silent, shrink-wrapped slabs of something.

And that was all the meat in the entire store.

Just those two.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said, barely louder than a whisper. ‚ÄúYou can find it in the back‚Ä¶in the frozen section.‚Äù

She looked at me.

Not for a second. Not for ten.

But for two full minutes.

She didn‚Äôt move.

Didn‚Äôt blink.

Just stood there, that same polite smile frozen across a face that didn‚Äôt breathe‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt breathe.

And then she said it.

‚ÄúThank you, Remi.‚Äù

My stomach dropped.

I never told her my name and my uniform didn't even have a nameplate.

But before I could react, she turned‚Äîslow, mechanical‚Äîand began walking down the back hallway.

That‚Äôs when I saw them.

Her feet.

They weren‚Äôt aligned with her body‚Äîangled just slightly toward the entrance, like she‚Äôd walked in backward‚Ä¶ and never fixed it.

As she walked away‚Äîthose misaligned feet shuffling against the linoleum‚ÄîI stayed frozen behind the counter, eyes locked on her until she disappeared into the back hallway.

Silence returned, thick and heavy.

I waited. One second. Then ten. Then a full minute.

No sound. No footsteps. No freezer door opening.

Just silence.

I should‚Äôve stayed behind the counter. I knew I should have. But something pulled at me. Curiosity. Stupidity. A need to know if those meat packs were even still there.

So I moved.

I moved down the hallway, one cautious step at a time.

The overhead lights buzzed softly‚Äîno flickering, just a steady, dull hum. Dimmer than before. Almost like they didn‚Äôt want to witness what was ahead.

The back room door stood open.

I hesitated at the threshold, heart hammering in my chest. The freezer was closed. Exactly how I‚Äôd left it. But she was gone. No trace of her. No footprints. No sound. Then I noticed it‚Äîone of the meat packets was missing. My stomach turned. And that‚Äôs when I heard it.

Ding. The soft chime of the front door bell. I bolted back toward the front, sneakers slipping on the tile. By the time I reached the counter, the door was already swinging shut with a gentle click. Outside? Empty parking lot. Inside? No one.

She was gone.

And I collapsed.

My knees gave out beneath me as panic took over, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might tear through my chest. My breath came in short gasps. Every instinct screamed Run, escape‚Äîget out.

But then I remembered Rule Six:

**Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

I stared at the front door like it might bite me.

I couldn‚Äôt leave.

I was trapped.

My hands were trembling. I needed to regroup‚Äîbreathe, think. I stumbled to the employee restroom and splashed cold water on my face, hoping it would shock my mind back into something resembling calm.

And that‚Äôs when I saw it.

In the mirror‚Äîwedged between the glass and the frame‚Äîwas a folded piece of paper. Just barely sticking out.

I pulled it free and opened it.

Four words. Bold, smeared, urgent:

DONT ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Ä¶‚Äù I whispered.

I stepped out of the bathroom in a daze, the note still clutched in my hand, and made my way back to the stockroom, trying to focus on something normal. Sorting. Stacking. Anything to distract myself from whatever this was.

That‚Äôs when I saw it.

A stairwell.

Half-hidden behind a row of unmarked boxes‚Äîsteps leading down. The hallway at the bottom stretched into a wide, dark tunnel that ended at a heavy iron door.

I felt my stomach twist.

The basement.

The one from Rule One:

**Never enter the basement.**

I shouldn‚Äôt have even looked. But I did. I peeked at the closed door.

And that‚Äôs when I heard it.

A voice. Muffled, desperate.

‚ÄúLet me out‚Ä¶‚Äù

Bang.

‚ÄúPlease!‚Äù another voice cried, pounding the door from the other side.

Then another. And another.

A rising chorus of fists and pleas. The sound of multiple people screaming‚Äîscreaming like their souls were on fire. Bloodcurdling, ragged, animalistic.

I turned and ran.

Bolted across the store, sprinting in the opposite direction, away from the basement, away from those voices. The farther I got, the quieter it became.

By the time I reached the far side of the store, it was silent again.

As if no one had ever spoken. As if no one had screamed. As if that door at the bottom of the stairs didn‚Äôt exist.

Then the bell at the reception desk rang.

Ding.

I froze.

Rule Four punched through my fog of fear:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

I slowly turned toward the clock hanging at the center of the store.

2:35 a.m.

Shit.

The bell rang again‚Äîharder this time. More impatient. I was directly across the store, hidden behind an aisle, far from the counter.

I crouched low and peeked through a gap between shelves.

And what I saw chilled me to the bone.

It wasn‚Äôt a person.

It was a creature‚Äîcrouched on all fours, nearly six feet tall and hunched. Its skin was hairless, stretched and raw like sun-scorched flesh. Its limbs were too long. Its fingers curled around the edge of the counter like claws.

And its face‚Ä¶

It had no eyes.

Just a gaping, unhinged jaw‚Äîso wide I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was screaming or simply unable to close.

It turned its head in my direction.

It didn‚Äôt need eyes to know.

Then‚Äî

The alarm went off.

Rule Ten echoed in my head like a warning bell:

**If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

The sirens wailed through the store‚Äîshrill and disorienting. I froze, forcing every muscle in my body to go still. I didn‚Äôt even dare to blink.

And then, beneath the screech of the alarm, came the voice.

Low and Crooked. Not human.

‚ÄúRemi‚Ä¶ in Aisle 6‚Ä¶ report to the reception.‚Äù

The voice repeated it again, warped and mechanical like it was being dragged through static.

‚ÄúRemi in Aisle 6‚Ä¶ come to the desk.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt move.

Didn‚Äôt breathe.

But my eyes‚Äîmy traitorous eyes‚Äîdrifted upward. And what I saw made my stomach drop through the floor.

Aisle 6.

I was in Aisle 6.

The second I realized it, I heard it move.

The thing near the desk snapped its head and launched forward‚Äîcharging down the store like it had been waiting for this cue. I didn‚Äôt wait. I didn't think. Just thought, ‚ÄúScrew this,‚Äù and ran.

The sirens only got louder. Harsher. Shadows started slithering out from between shelves, writhing like smoke with claws‚Äîreaching, grasping.

Every step I took felt like outrunning death itself.

The creature was behind me now, fast and wild, crashing through displays, howling without a mouth that ever closed. The shadows weren‚Äôt far behind‚Äîhungry, screaming through the noise.

I turned sharply toward the back hallway, toward the only place left: the stairwell.

I shoved the basement door open and slipped behind it at the last second, flattening myself behind the frame just as the creature skidded through.

It didn‚Äôt see me.

It didn‚Äôt even hesitate.

It charged down the stairs, dragging the shadows with it into the dark.

I slammed the door shut and twisted the handle.

Click.

It auto-locked. Thank God.

The pounding began immediately.

Fists‚Äîor claws‚Äîbeating against the other side. Screams‚Äîinhuman, layered, dozens of voices all at once‚Äîrose from beneath the floor like a chorus of the damned.

I collapsed beside the door, chest heaving, soaked in sweat. Every nerve in my body was fried, my thoughts scrambled and spinning.

I sat there for what felt like forever‚Äîmaybe an hour, maybe more‚Äîwhile the screams continued, until they faded into silence.

Eventually, I dragged myself to the breakroom.

No sirens. No voices. Just the hum of the fridge and the buzz of old lights.

I made myself coffee with shaking hands, not because I needed it‚Äîbecause I didn‚Äôt know what else to do.

I stared at the cup like it might offer answers to questions I was too tired‚Äîand too scared‚Äîto ask.

All I could think was:

God, I hope I never come back.

But even as the thought passed through me, I knew it was a lie.

The contract said one year.

One full year of this madness.

And there was no getting out.

By the time 6 a.m. rolled around, the store had returned to its usual, suffocating quiet‚Äîlike nothing had ever happened.

Then the bell above the front door jingled.

The old man walked in.

He paused when he saw me sitting in the breakroom. Alive.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still here?‚Äù he asked, genuinely surprised.

I looked up, dead-eyed. ‚ÄúNo shit, Sherlock.‚Äù

He let out a low chuckle, almost impressed. ‚ÄúTold you it wasn‚Äôt your average night shift. But I think this is the first time a newbie has actually made it through the first night.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot an average night shift doesn‚Äôt mean you die on the clock, old man,‚Äù I muttered.

He brushed off the criticism with a shrug. ‚ÄúYou followed the rules. That‚Äôs the only reason you‚Äôre still breathing.‚Äù

I swallowed hard, my voice barely steady. ‚ÄúCan I quit?‚Äù

His eyes didn‚Äôt even flicker. ‚ÄúNope. The contract says one year.‚Äù

I already knew that but it still stung hearing it out loud.

‚ÄúBut,‚Äù he added, casually, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a way out.‚Äù

I looked up slowly, wary.

‚ÄúYou can leave early,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúif you get promoted.‚Äù

That word stopped me cold.

DON‚ÄôT ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

The note in the bathroom flashed through my mind like a warning shot.

‚ÄúPromotion?‚Äù I asked, carefully measuring the word.

‚ÄúNot many make it that far,‚Äù he said, matter-of-fact. No emotion. No concern. Like he was stating the weather.

I didn‚Äôt respond. Just stared.

He slid an envelope across the table.

Inside: my paycheck.

$500.

For one night of surviving hell.

‚ÄúYou earned it,‚Äù he said, standing. ‚ÄúUniform rack‚Äôll have your size ready by tonight. See you at eleven.‚Äù

Then he walked out. Calm. Routine. Like we‚Äôd just finished another late shift at a grocery store.

But nothing about this job was normal.

And if ‚Äúnot many make it to the promotion,‚Äù that could only mean one thing.

Most don‚Äôt make it at all.

I pocketed the check and stepped out into the pale morning light.

The parking lot was still. Too still.

I walked to my car, every step echoing louder than it should‚Äôve. I slid into the driver‚Äôs seat, hands gripping the wheel‚Äîknuckles white.

I sat there for a long time, engine off, staring at the rising sun.

Thinking.

Wondering if I‚Äôd be stupid enough to come back tomorrow.

And knowing, deep down‚Ä¶

Woke up this morning to a [seats.aero](http://seats.aero) alert for 2x non-stop TPE-AMS seats in early January in J for 85,000 Flying Blue Points and $190 USD each. Post-coffee, the flights are still available online, so I transfer the requisite points and try to book for me and P2. But after entering the our names in the system, I get an error ‚Äî ""This booking can't be completed online, please finish this booking by calling our call center,"" or something of the like.

  
I obviously ignore this, and just try to start the booking over again. I try a different browser, as my default browser sometimes doesn't play nicely with KLM/Air France. Then I see that the price has doubled (classic dynamic pricing). But I check on my phone via the  Air France app \~15 minutes later, and the price is back down. Again, try to make the booking, again an error.

  
So, I finally call KLM. And it turns out a booking reference had already been created for me. They just needed P2s DOB (which, for some reason, the online form didn't collect?) I provide that, get sent to the automatic payment system to enter my credit card details, etc. After entering my card details 3 times, including one disconnection and call-back, I'm finally ticketed.

A DEATHLY DILEMMA - 1

The body didn‚Äôt¬†*seem*¬†out of the ordinary; it didn‚Äôt breathe, its heart didn‚Äôt beat, and it certainly smelled dead. There was nothing that would distinguish it from any other dead body, or imply that it was not, in fact, dead.

So where, pray tell, was its soul?¬†

Otis squinted at the space above the body, as if the garage‚Äôs fluorescent lights were just a bit too dim and¬†*that*¬†was the reason he couldn‚Äôt see the soul. He even went so far as to nudge the body with his shoe, hoping the soul was somehow wedged underneath the corpse. This, of course, accomplished nothing (but made him wonder if he should get his oxfords professionally cleaned). In all his years spent reaping‚Äìforever, \*literally‚Äì\*he had never encountered a body without a soul. He‚Äôd encountered a body with two souls a few millennia back, during Chaos‚Äôs experimental phase, but never one without.

‚ÄúHuh. You were right. No soul.‚Äù Behind him, Wilderness‚Äôs nose was upturned, and she scrunched it slightly as she sniffed the air around him. She was the only Primordial able to sniff out souls‚Äìodd, considering Otis was the one who collected them, but the universe never claimed to be fair.

Otis squatted down to examine the body further. It had been a woman, with long dark hair, pale skin, and hands that were balled into fists. One arm rested across its chest, while the other was raised above its head. Its legs were bent outwards at the knee, but clearly unbroken. A few light bruises sprinkled the corpse‚Äôs face and torso, but there were no other wounds‚Äìabsolutely nothing that would tell Otis how the human died or why it lacked a soul.

Otis leaned back, letting himself fall into a sitting position, and scanned his surroundings. He found only concrete, harsh yellow lines, and the stale air that was typical of a building with no windows‚Äìnothing out of the ordinary. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see an obvious murder weapon,‚Äù he started, ‚Äúbut the humans are becoming increasingly creative in the ways they slaughter each other. Can you sense anything that might have been used to poison it?‚Äù

Wilderness rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúHer, not it.‚Äù Otis shrugged her off‚Äìthe green-eyed Primordial‚Äôs voice was fittingly melodious, but this didn‚Äôt make her correction any less annoying. She closed her eyes, and he could feel her magic reach out around them for a few moments before fading away. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù she said. In a fashion entirely expected of an environmentalist, she waved disdainfully at the cars a few meters away. ‚ÄúMaybe one of these death-traps hit her?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt,‚Äù he said pointedly, ‚Äúwould be mangled if something hit it hard enough to kill it.‚Äù He rubbed his temples gently, trying to stave off the headache that was slowly forming.

‚ÄúThen what the hell could have killed her?‚Äù Wilderness asked, irritation lacing her voice. Otis flinched at her choice of word for his realm, no doubt brought on by his unwillingness to refer to the body as anything but an ‚Äúit.‚Äù

‚ÄúTypically, we ask the soul,‚Äù he muttered.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be an ass, Death.‚Äù She crossed her arms. ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do?‚Äù

Otis didn‚Äôt want to admit that he didn‚Äôt know. He did, however, know that he wanted some distance between himself and this situation. ‚ÄúFor now, I think it‚Äôs time we leave,‚Äù came his response. ‚ÄúFancy a tea?‚Äù She raised an eyebrow at him and nodded.

A moment later, they stood inside of Otis‚Äôs favorite coffee shop. Had it been any other day, he might have asked her where she wanted to go. Today, however, he felt the need to remind her that he had a few tricks up his sleeve, too; she might be able to sniff out souls, but he was the only Primordial who could instantaneously travel cross-galaxy.

They stepped inside, and Otis immediately relaxed. Andromeda‚Äôs Aroma was (unsurprisingly) on the outskirts of the Andromeda galaxy. Otis loved the place; there were hundreds of caf√©s back home in the Deadlands, but they were littered with souls who‚Äôd want to talk about their¬†*feelings*¬†and how being dead has¬†*traumatized*¬†them. No, he‚Äôd much rather be a few light years away, even if he had to deal with a stray martian or two.

Otis breathed in deeply, letting the change in environment comfort him. The air in Andromeda was characteristically strawberry-scented, pink-tinged, and just dense enough to feel like silk in his lungs. The caf√©, in particular, had a way of amplifying these traits. Lacey pink bows dotted the windows, and flower-shaped lights cast a welcoming glow on patrons sipping strawberry-themed drinks. He had brought Love with him, once, a few millennia ago. They had described the place as ‚ÄúPrincess Peach‚Äôs wet dream.‚Äù Otis wasn‚Äôt sure who Princess Peach was (though Love had explained the term ‚Äúwet dream,‚Äù unfortunately) but thinking of Love‚Äôs tone‚Äìequal parts surprise and bewilderment‚Äìstill made Otis smile.

Wilderness must have had a similar reaction, because let out a sound that could only be described as a guffaw. ‚ÄúWhere the¬†*fuck*¬†are we, Otis?‚Äù The corner of his mouth lifted, slightly.

‚ÄúSit,‚Äù he said, ignoring her question. Skirts billowing around her, she glided to a table near them. It was round, with velvet armchairs shaped like hearts on either side of it. Laughing at the sight of it, she plopped down, laying her head on one arm and draping her legs over the other.

For a long time, Otis had envied Wilderness. Watching her now, kicking her feet into the air and giggling at the menu, he could almost remember why. He had never had the pleasure of a careless nature, not in the way Wilderness did. Otis supposed that was her birthright (or rather, popped-into-existence right). She was unrestrained, overgrown, as vibrant and unabashedly herself as the wildflowers that grew between concrete in cities.¬†

Otis, on the other hand, had no choice but to be restrained. Carelessness was not an option for Death‚Äìso, he practiced control in every aspect, down to his meticulously gelled hair and the perfectly straight line of his spine against the chair.

Wilderness waved a waiter over. He was a short, stocky man‚Äìan Andromeda native, judging by the extra arm growing between his shoulder blades. The third limb gene had died out across most humanoid species, but had somehow prevailed amongst Andromedans‚Äìas such, the species made for particularly good waitstaff.¬†

Wilderness ordered an iced tea. Otis ordered his usual: a strawberry-infused shaken and frozen cappuccino, with half whole milk and half two percent, exactly 17 ounces of whipped cream, raspberry drizzle along the cup, and cocoa powder sprinkled over the top. The waiter jotted this down and rushed away to prepare the drinks.

Hearing his order, the curly-haired Primordial gaped at him. ‚ÄúI figured you‚Äôd order a coffee ‚Äòblack like your soul‚Äô or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúSouls are not black.‚Äù They were a translucent milky-white color. Otis leaned back into his chair, running his hand across the soft velvet. The waiter scurried back to their table, placing their drinks down.

‚ÄúNot the point. But, speaking of souls,‚Äù she trailed off, stirring her tea. ‚ÄúWhat do you think happened to that woman?‚Äù

‚ÄúOne of Chaos‚Äôs experiments, probably. You know better than anyone how he loves tampering with souls,‚Äù Otis answered matter-of-factly.

‚ÄúUgh, yeah, the whole soulmates thing,‚Äù she rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúAnyone could‚Äôve guessed that outcome.‚Äù Chaos thought he could solve some of humanity‚Äôs problems by putting soulmates into the same body, but the mortals hadn‚Äôt taken well to sharing limbs. Go figure.

‚ÄúI suppose I‚Äôll be paying my brother a visit in the near future,‚Äù Otis sighed at the thought. He‚Äôd never particularly liked his brother, for the same reason he and Wilderness had never been close. Their sister, Order‚Äìnow¬†*she*¬†got along perfectly with Otis, particularly when she scolded Chaos for messing with souls or disrupting the balance.

A scream cut across the caf√©, interrupting their conversation. Otis paid it no mind, and kept his eyes fixed on his drink‚Äìthe mortals were always upset about something, and Andromedans were particularly dramatic‚Äìuntil Wilderness nudged him.

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù she breathed, her eyes round. She reminded him of a deer in headlights.

Otis glanced in the direction of the scream. A circle of customers was forming around their waiter, who seemed to be having some sort of seizure. It was unlike anything Otis had ever seen before‚Äìand he was Death. He had seen some¬†*shit.*¬†The man‚Äôs movements were angry; his hands were balled into fists, and he seemed to be punching himself, rather than convulsing. The blows landed all over his face and torso.

Weirder even, his legs were engaged in some kind of jig. He bobbed up and down, kicking one leg in front of him as he did so. He made no sounds (aside from the tapping of his shoes on the pink tile) and his face was completely still, as if he was asleep. Then, he collapsed‚Äìdead. All of the Primordials could smell death, and there was no mistaking the sickly sweet scent in the air.¬†

Weirder¬†*yet,*¬†his soul was missing. There were no dim lights hovering above the body.

As one of the Andromedans leaned down to check the man‚Äôs pulse, Otis turned to Wilderness. ‚ÄúDo you smell anything?‚Äù he asked.

She shook her head, her face frozen in disbelief. ‚ÄúJust death.‚Äù The Andromedan became frantic, all three hands searching the man‚Äôs body for any sign of life. Panic was setting in with the other customers, and the caf√© became increasingly louder. Sirens pierced the air‚Äìsomeone had the sense to call a medical hovership, evidently.

Otis sighed. ‚ÄúIt seems as though I‚Äôll be seeing my brother sooner rather than later.‚Äù",1,1753950046.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False

She shook her head, her face frozen in disbelief. ‚ÄúJust death.‚Äù The Andromedan became frantic, all three hands searching the man‚Äôs body for any sign of life. Panic was setting in with the other customers, and the caf√© became increasingly louder. Sirens pierced the air‚Äìsomeone had the sense to call a medical hovership, evidently.

Otis sighed. ‚ÄúIt seems as though I‚Äôll be seeing my brother sooner rather than later.‚Äù

In the age of smart homes and seamless technology, the kitchen has evolved from a purely functional space into a high-tech hub for daily living. As appliances get smarter and kitchens become more connected, one innovation is quietly revolutionizing how we interact with this space ‚Äî the [wireless charging kitchen counter](https://kewlabstech.com/applications/wireless-charging-kitchen-countertop/).

Imagine preparing dinner, brewing coffee, or enjoying breakfast while your phone or wireless earbuds charge effortlessly ‚Äî with **no cords, no clutter, and no visible charging pads**. That‚Äôs the power of wireless charging built directly into your countertops. It‚Äôs not just about convenience; it‚Äôs about blending form and function in a truly modern kitchen.

In this article, we‚Äôll explore what wireless charging kitchen counters are, how they work, the benefits they offer, and why they‚Äôre quickly becoming a top feature in new kitchen designs and renovations.

# üì± What Is a Wireless Charging Kitchen Counter?

A **wireless charging kitchen counter** is a kitchen surface embedded with or paired with **invisible wireless charging technology**. These chargers are usually installed **beneath the surface**, allowing you to place your smartphone, earbuds, or any Qi-compatible device directly on a marked spot to charge ‚Äî no visible hardware or messy cords involved.

These counters work with **Qi wireless charging**, the global standard for wireless power transfer, and can deliver 5W to 15W of power to supported devices.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How Does It Work?

Wireless charging counters use **inductive charging**, which transfers energy via magnetic fields between two coils ‚Äî one in the charger, and one in your device.

In a typical wireless charging counter:

1. A **charging unit** is mounted **underneath** the countertop.
2. It emits a magnetic field through the non-metallic surface (like quartz, granite, wood, or laminate).
3. When a compatible device is placed on the charging zone, it **automatically begins charging**.
4. A subtle indicator (sticker, etching, or LED) marks where to place the device for optimal charging.

Some models even use **smart detection** and **foreign object sensors** to ensure safety and performance.

# üîç Materials That Work Best

Wireless charging counters are designed to work through **non-metallic surfaces**. The most compatible materials include:

* ü™µ **Wood**
* ü™® **Engineered quartz**
* üß± **Granite** (if thickness allows)
* üßΩ **Laminate**
* üçΩÔ∏è **Solid surface materials** like Corian

Stone surfaces like marble or granite may require **thinner slabs** (typically less than 30mm) for the magnetic field to transmit effectively. Newer long-range chargers can transmit through thicker materials, making this technology more accessible.

# üí° Benefits of Wireless Charging Kitchen Counters

# 1. No Cords, No Clutter

Say goodbye to tangled cords, misplaced adapters, and bulky chargers. With an embedded wireless charger, your countertops stay clean, open, and aesthetically pleasing.

# 2. Convenient Charging Hub

Whether you're following a recipe on your phone, FaceTiming with family, or listening to music while cooking, your device stays powered without needing to leave the kitchen.

# 3. Enhanced Home Value

Wireless charging countertops offer a **wow factor** for homebuyers and visitors alike. As part of the smart kitchen trend, they add functional elegance and increase your home‚Äôs tech appeal.

# 4. Safe and Water-Resistant

Because the hardware is hidden under the surface, it‚Äôs protected from water spills, grease, crumbs, and kitchen messes ‚Äî a huge plus for safety and durability.

# 5. Perfect for Families

With multiple devices in use at any given time, a central charging location in the kitchen makes it easier for everyone in the household to stay connected.

# üè° Ideal Applications in the Kitchen

Wireless charging isn‚Äôt limited to just one part of the kitchen. Here are a few ideal zones for installation:

* üßë‚Äçüç≥ **Kitchen Islands**: Central and spacious, perfect for phones while cooking or entertaining.
* ‚òï **Coffee Stations**: Charge while you make your morning brew.
* üç¥ **Breakfast Bars**: Great for quick device top-ups during meals.
* üìñ **Recipe Zones**: Keeps your phone or tablet charged while following cooking instructions.

In open-concept kitchens, this feature also adds a layer of convenience to nearby dining and living areas.

# üîå Installation: What You Need to Know

Most wireless charging units for countertops are designed for **easy installation**:

# ‚úÖ DIY-Friendly Kits

* Many brands offer complete installation kits that include the charging pad, power adapter, mounting hardware, and alignment tools.
* You simply mount the device underneath the countertop and plug it in.
* A sticker or laser-etched guide on top indicates the charging area.

# üß∞ Professional Install

* For stone or quartz surfaces, professional installation may be recommended to avoid damage during drilling or alignment.
* Some smart kitchen renovation packages now include wireless charging as a standard upgrade.

Make sure to check surface thickness compatibility (usually between 8‚Äì30mm) and confirm your material is non-metallic.

# üß† Key Features to Look For

When choosing a wireless charging solution for your kitchen counter, consider the following features:

* **Charging Distance**: Make sure the charger supports your surface thickness.
* **Fast Charging Capability**: Look for models with 10W or 15W output.
* **Qi Certification**: Ensures compatibility and safety.
* **Smart Detection**: Avoids charging through metal or if foreign objects are detected.
* **Discreet Indicators**: Helps users locate the charging zone easily.
* **Heat Management**: Important for extended or high-speed charging.

# üè∑Ô∏è Popular Brands Offering Kitchen Counter Wireless Chargers

Several companies specialize in long-range, surface-integrated wireless charging, including:

# üå± Eco-Friendly and Future-Ready

As more homes aim for sustainability, reducing e-waste is a big win. **Wireless charging eliminates the need for frequent cable replacements** and ensures longer-lasting charging setups. With future phones expected to be portless, investing in built-in wireless charging is a smart and eco-conscious move.

I have round that I am a ""swirler"", that I dont like the paddle thingy and the user underrated_asshole makes a fun espresso-like drink. 

I have found that different grind settings all has their ups and downs, so finding my favorite is a bit of a roller coaster. 
 
Since I have my old trusted Wilfa Svart, I had a moment of clarity(or insanity). If i set the grinder to my coursest preference, push grind, and then adjust the grind size in one fluid motion into my finest preference, i should get best of everything. Right? 

I like it. I think, but let's wait and see if this becomes my daily coffee.
