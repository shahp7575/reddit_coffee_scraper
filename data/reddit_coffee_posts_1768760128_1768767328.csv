**The problem:**  
A trip to Norway needs train routes, cabin rentals, and Northern Lights timing. A trip to Portugal needs pastel de nata spots, Fado bars, and Lisbon tram culture. One AI can't do both well.

**Possible solution**  
\- I could build country-specific AI agents. Each one understands:  
\- Local train operators and routes  
\- Regional food culture  
\- Seasonal events and festivals  
\- Hidden neighborhoods (not just tourist traps)  
\- Language-specific place names

**How I would do it:**  
\- Building a ""spine database"" with specific data sets  
\- Adding niche categories: organic wine regions, specialty coffee, lesser-known train routes  
\- Sourcing from local providers (not just Google)  
\- Attributing sources for transparency (e.g., ""Source: Raisin"")

**Question:** Would that make sense?

1qgiyqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/initiald/comments/1qgiyqd/my_initial_d_struggle/,My Initial D Struggle,"*TLDR version: I watched ID 8 years ago but couldn’t continue watching the rest because even though I know anime isn’t real, I was jealous of Takumi and the other characters since my autism prevented me from getting a license until age 22 (even at 24 now I still don’t drive unless its practice with my father), and my late-teens and early-20s was spent alone using electronics and dealing with mental health issues.*

I watched the first 7 episodes of Initial D 8 years ago, but then I stopped watching it. What started my negative feelings with the anime wasn’t that I disliked it, it is that I was 16 at the time but slowly approaching 18 years old, and as someone on the autism spectrum with slow development and struggle to be independent, I knew I could never be behind of the wheel of a car or do drifting or anything like that by Takumi’s age (and it is explained in the show that he’s been driving the AE86 since middle school, lol). He also had a love interest in the show, Natsuki, and I also knew that by the time I was 18 years old, my chances of having a girl buddy that would want to something as silly as show off her new one-piece swimsuit at the beach (we all know Natsuki’s a meme by now) was incredibly slim, and as of now (24 years old) I’m still single but am now planning on trying to find someone (I particularly have a soft spot in my heart for Kyoko Iwase, especially since the FD RX-7 is a favorite car of mine, and I’m looking for a girl who could be into Initial D and a bit into cars too where we could possibly both own NA Miatas). I have never got around to rewatching and finishing the Initial D series because of this mental health issue I had that still somewhat lingers in me regarding it. I can’t deny that I enjoyed being a teenager and early-20s adult and had my fun, but from the time I was 18 to about 22 it was also the most stressful era of my life. The covid pandemic occurred when I was about to turn 19, and it also did not help with that.

As I’m 24 years old now, that makes me pretty much older than basically all of the series’ main characters now, which too makes me feel down, especially as someone who only got their license 2 years ago (I did however pass my exam the first time and mastered parallel parking while other students were in the grass, major feats and simply incredible for someone with autism) but is still learning how to drive to the point where I can comfortably do it without my father aiding me. I can best compare the feelings I had with Initial D and still feel enough that it prevents me from watching the series to that of a Japanese/Korean girl who desires to be a J-pop/K-pop star like the ones she idolizes, but she never got a chance to try out for choir or music lessons because she had some problems she was dealing with, and eventually she never got to the chance to try and become a young star like she wished. Same for a teenage guy who wanted to play basketball in high school and make it to a college team but other life events or autism also got in their way, and watching Kuroko’s Basketball makes them feel sad.

I always felt like the Initial D characters were like superheroes, not because they have mind control or superhuman strength, but because they were all part of “the rock band that made you want to start your own rock band.” Tons of kids grew up seeing a young Tommy Lee or Eddie Van Halen be the one of the best instrument players in the world at such a tender age, but when they started their own band, they didn’t get along with their mates and the band was dead on arrival.

I bet you wanted to be a “superhero” of some sorts too, I mean everyone wanted to as a kid, but having jealousy over not being who you wished to be doesn’t really harper people where they wish they could rewind to their teenage past with more knowledge and more money and resources and go a different route. But the trauma and sadness that Initial D unintentionally gave me due to my constant habit of comparing myself to others due to my autism and immaturity completely took me away from enjoying a series I would have enjoyed during the past 8 years instead of just listening to its music and knowing the characters’ names and what cars they drive and nothing else.

I especially thought I’d be drifting an NA Miata by age 20 when I was 15 years old because when I was 15 years old, I read a library book that forever intrigued me about the early days of American Formula Drift, where known drifter Ken Gushi, then 15 years old, won a tournament after Initial D inspired his father, who likely was already a retired racer of some sorts, to buy him an AE86 to drift. Chris Forsberg and Vaughn Gitten Jr., both big Formula Drift stars, also started going sideways at a young age. Initial D very much inspired people the same age as its main characters (teens or early 20s) to pick up the drifting hobby in the United States. But that was 2003. Back then, Formula Drift was a cheap production where you “ran what you bringed,” (sponsors weren’t even mandatory) and now it requires a whole team and a $500,000 1,000+ hp purpose-built drift car, as well as countless sponsors to even have a chance. Plus, cars like the AE86 and Nissan 240SX were dirt cheap then and a teenager or college kid could buy them for chump change.

In modern times, there’s still kids in their teens and early 20s, like Adam LZ and TJ Hunt when they were younger, that have money for building a car and then drifting and racing it (or simply showing it off), but it’s fairly obvious that they had parents who had the disposable income to throw $50,000 at their sons without much regret. But if you walked up to an average car lover aged 17-24 years old and ask them about the idea of building a car for drifting or racing, or even autocrossing, they laugh at you, because they likely all own completely unexciting daily-driver cars like a 2012 Nissan Altima as their only car, and they would much rather play Forza or Assetto Corsa than experience the actual glory of drifting or racing because it’s wildly expensive and time-consuming for their video game and social media-riddled lives. Some enthusiasts in their early-20s may have a cheap used Subaru WRX, Honda Civic Si, or Volkswagen GTi, but all most of them really do with those cars is make “braaap” noises with their exhausts and cruise and look cool, which isn’t exactly living a fantasy.

I also envy the Initial D characters because they have the perfect playground to fool around with their toys: mountain pass roads empty at night where they can practice the art of drifting (which because of my cars on Forza absolutely losing all control when using the simulation wheel, I still see as the hardest thing I can ever imagine doing with a car even though I want to do it so badly), participate in organized street racing teams, and engage in one-on-one battles on the mountain. Unfortunately, in modern day Japan, speed cameras, speed bumps, the illegal stigma (which the Japanese take seriously, breaking laws makes everyone else despise you), and the obvious fact that drifting is now unaffordable has almost completely wiped midnight touge drifting off the planet.

The only thing I found that could make anybody live up their Initial D fantasy is Drift Appalachia, which is held probably like once a year (instead of a couple miles from a Tofu shop every single midnight) on the roads of the Appalachia mountains in bum fuck Egypt (West Virginia, 10 hours from where I live). There is, however, bring-your-own-car drift events at the race track an hour away from where I live. But unlike the street racing in Initial D, both events are held very rarely (though actual race track events are far more common), cost a fair bit of money to enter, are always held at day and never at night, barely any people might even show up, and there are no “battles”, just guys in their late 20s or early 30s sliding their beat-up old BMWs or Infinitis around corners and hitting walls because they’re not very good drivers anyways.

It is a genuine dream to me as a car enthusiast and automotive journalist in-training to be able to find a way to get into a business running races on extremely curvy roads (mountain or not mountain, especially as actual race tracks are going out of business, hence one of the reasons dumb street takeovers happen) that are legally sanctioned by police officers every Saturday night from 6 pm to 1 am (or morning too, more likely) in the same fashion as Cars & Coffee events. I wanted it to essentially be Initial D meets the World Series of Poker, where the drift duel races with the top drivers are streamed online for people to watch, while the drivers that are in the far back of the leaderboard, like with the World Series of Poker, aren’t worth televising are just there for fun. But as much as every car enthusiast wants this to become a reality, it’s an incredibly difficult proposition, likely impossible.

Other than the driving in Initial D, I also obviously feel that I didn’t get to have the late teenager to early twenties life I wish I had that was featured in the non-racing scenes. To me, Initial D is exactly like those old 1960s surf movies with teenagers going surfing, riding a Harley Davidson with their buddies while wearing leather jackets and sucking on a lollipop, flirting on girls with poodle skirts, and with the protagonist trying to become the best surfer at the big Summer surfing challenge and win the love of a girl who is probably named Penny or some shit. My teens and early twenties were completely spent alone with no friends to have fun with, especially because of my mental health issues and autism.

If anyone here has a similar story and can give me advice on how to get over these feelings I have and enjoy the Initial D series with a smile, it’ll be greatly appreciated.",2,1768767060.0,initiald,0,1.0,False

**Presentation (First Look!)**

For the price, the presentation is crazy. The box feels way nicer than it should, and the bottle gives me old-school brandy glass vibes. Super display-worthy. It's funny, I feel like I'm holding an old glass from the '60s!



**Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa wear test (First Sniff! )**

From the first sniff, this one definitely gives me a sweet, cozy, and holiday-ready gourmand. I get some coffee, vanilla, cinnamon, and this praline-like sweetness that makes me keep sniffing my wrist. Then, as I continue to smell more, I get a warm, spicy, and honestly kind of addictive smell. It feels built for cool weather, and I can see it really flourishing during the fall/winter, especially around the holidays. Great for holiday gatherings, nights out, and date night when you want something cozy but still noticeable. If you don’t like sweet gourmands, this is not the “safe” blind buy.



**Listed notes**

**Top:** Cinnamon, Cardamom, Ginger

**Heart:** Praline, Candied Fruits, White Flowers

**Base:** Vanilla, Coffee, Tonka Bean, Benzoin, Musk



**Performance (on me)**

I’m getting around 12 hours on skin and on clothes (Jacket a couple of days!). Maybe a little of. Projection is strong, about a 2 ft bubble for 3+ hours before it starts calming down. Sillage is strong, people definitely notice while I walk by.



**Pros**

The coffee + vanilla + cinnamon combo is pretty addictive and instantly gives cozy holiday vibes. Performance is legit for the price.



**Cons**

I don't have any dislikes or cons about this fragrance!



**When I’d wear it**

Fall/winter for sure, and cold nights in early spring. I’d avoid heat unless you go super light. I could see myself reaching for this for a date night, night out, or holiday gathering!



**Overall**

For under $30, this feels like a steal! This could become a unisex fragrance to me. If you like sweet, cozy gourmands and want something for holidays, date nights, or going out at night, it’s an easy recommendation.



**Rating: 5/5**



I also heard this is a clone of Angel's Share by Kilians. I personally have not tried that fragrance, but is it close to the comparison or far off? Please share your opinion

With Ben, Sam, Chad, Liam, and Luis

Samus vs Kai’sa (Metroid vs League of Legends) It’s fine. Sam explain’s Kai’sa’s deal. Her symbiote thing is similar to samus’s new suits. Chad said Kai’sa is such a complicated character to try and figure out due to her level up thing. They get it and thinks it is cool. 

Robbie Reyes vs Devilman (Marvel vs Devilman) Devilman is a classic. Liam would love to look into devilman. Ben says if ghost rider comes back it would be cool to do robbie. Luis says as long as batman has more match ups anyone can come back for more match ups. 

Swin Abel vs Throne Anguis (Trails in Reverie vs Octopath Traveler 2) the names really seem strange. Especially “Swin Abel” gets a lot of jokes about his name. They have no idea who Swin is but would like to explore Octopath. Sam clarifies “Octopath 2, because Octopath 1 is not a good game. Fight me”

Kamina vs Gustav (Gurren Laggan vs Expedition 33) Don’t want to read the connections because there is a big spoiler/part is blocked out. They know what the spoiler is though. Sam says Kamina should scale way higher than gustav, but Liam says Kamina dies before things get crazy. Liam also says “but so does gustav” which Sam says “i assume that is what the spoiler was. Thanks liam.” but they quickly check the spoiler and see it doesn’t talk about that.

Ultra Instinct Shaggy vs Matt (Scooby Doo vs Wii Sports) is called a joke battle in the description. They say Matt is the final boss for every wii sport thing not just boxing. Both are memes

Qrow vs Eda (RWBY vs The Owl House) talked about this before. They get the theme. They carry a “Bird-den” (burden). Makes sense

Yodaka vs Gabimaru (Shinobi Undercover vs Hell’s Paradise) Don’t know about either franchise. DJ knows Hell’s paradise but isn’t here today. The connections make sense. 

Mimic vs M3GAN (FNAF vs M3GAN) Thinks M3gan demolishes. Doesn’t know the mimic. Ben never saw M3gan and asks what she can do. If there is a third M3gan movie, they already have a three in the name so they screwed themselves.

Maelle vs Will (Clair Obscure vs Metaphor Refantazio) Has really cool art. “But the names are backwards and isn’t a thumbnail so you lost points” in Sam’s imaginary points. They do like the art with the background. Doesn’t know how strong Will is but assumes he is pretty strong given he is an Atlas character. They are interested in Clair Obscure on the show, especially since Maelle was part of the champion island at the start.

Koseki Bijou vs Diancie (Hololive vs Pokemon) Yeah. They read the connections and makes sense. They don’t know either, or at least barely remember Diancie. Luis asks how would they research a hololive character and Sam says they would have to set a day limit for any research. As in anything beyond wouldn’t count and that the hololive character can’t just say “yeah i would win because i can also do this…” Chad reads the pokedex entry and thinks that is insane. 

Daredevil vs Takayuki Yagami (Marvel vs Judgement) Knows judgment is a yakuza spin off but none of them have played it. Connections are pretty on the nose and seems fun. Thinks Daredevil is a little stronger.

Marcy Wu vs Donatello (Amphibia vs TMNT 03) Thumbnail looked blue and Liam got confused thinking it was Leo at first. They like it and thinks it is cool. Chad says “This is one of the match ups where they would be best friends” and both have super forms which is fun. 

Rimuru vs Kumoko (That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime vs So I’m a Spider, So What) Thinks they talked about this. Chad said “throwing random vowels in these”. Thinks this is the biggest monster isekai match up. They had a pitch on this. See’s Rimuru requests a lot. Liam asks if the series are done or still continuing. Ben says they are finished or almost finished.

Zuko vs Kuai Liang/Sub Zero (Avatar the Last Airbender vs Mortal Kombat) Love the thumbnail. Makes perfect sense. Thinks Aang being the stand in for scorpion makes sense but is also hilarious given their personalities. As far as the many fire vs ice match ups, this one bangs. A Chatter mentions Mortal Kombat: Scorpion’s Revenge/Battle for the realm was done by the same animation studio as “The Legend of Korra” with said studio founder was an animation director for ATLA

Megumi Fushigoro vs Shiroha Fujino (Jujutsu Kaisen vs Nue’s Excorcist) Liam immediately says “fraud watch. Just kidding i don’t know about Shiroha”. The thumbnail showing their strongest monster throws them off in a way that really impressed them. Jokes about Megumi trying to summon Mahorahga over every little pressure. 

Captain Wayne vs Risky Boots (Captain Wayne-Vacation Desperation vs Shantae) “Who the hell is captain wayne?” loves the energy the thumbnail gives off. Jokes “when the shantae character is the only one we know”. Says they would love to bring in Risky Boots, let alone Shantae into the show but have no idea who Captain Wayne is. Captain Wayne has a perfect 5/5 on steam. Liam suggests Captain Wayne vs Boomstick due to Shotgun arm vs Shotgun Leg. 

Nemesis vs Magician (Resident Evil vs House of the Dead) Sam says this is the next Colex. This is the most loved match up by far on this with 62 hearts (liam says five more and starts to do a gesture with his hands, upsetting Sam). However he says if they make it, only those 62 would watch it. Chad tries to argue against that saying their generation loved house of the dead. Thinks it is the best thumbnail for this match up yet, but they would have to do a different one if official due to the gore on the Magician Render. Liam says they need more Sega Dreamcast era characters on death battle. 

Sailor Mercury vs Tecna (Sailor Moon vs Winx Club) Japanese magical girl vs american magical girl. They think they have had pitches for multiple of this series combination. Chad says they ought to do winx one of these days. Sam says the winx design is the inspiration for unhinged plastic surgeons. 

Frieren vs Salem (Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End vs RWBY) Interesting contrast. Wants to do a Frieren episode and Liam says this makes sense. Ben isn’t convinced it is a good match up saying it is just based on their motivations in the story and not like in a battle or anything. Wonders if both of their magic would be interesting to see in a fight. Like is there an interesting way their magic can play off each other. “Because as far as death battle is concerned, who cares if they are really old ladies” also doesn’t remember if salem can do anything besides make monsters come out of the ground. 

GTA 5 Crew vs The PAYDAY Gang (GTA vs PAYDAY) Sam says he thinks the payday gang just gets hurt by bullets while the GTA crew can fall out of helicopters and get blown up. Sam does a goof and says the GTA crew has personalities while the PAYDAY gang is just silent player characters. Likes the idea of two bank heist teams trying to rob the same bank at the same time and having to kill eachother. Insane they haven’t done a GTA fight and is something they definitely should do. A chatter lets sam know the Payday gang has light speed reactions and fought inter-dimensional aliens, which sam responds “well fuck me then”.

Dan Kuso vs Gingka Hagane (Bakugan vs Beyblade) “Now We’re talking”. Luis really wants to do beyblade, especially to use the moses thing. Sam talks about staying with his partner’s family in england once and their child was really into beyblade, and would have a cute child British version of “let it rip”. Wants to do Beyblade money matches for a in person nightly brew stream. They all buy beyblades and customize them. Wants to get a Boomstick Audio trigger for “3,2,1 LET IT RIP”. “Anyways Bakugan also a thing.” (I’m sad that bakugan was reduced to that in the discussion) 

Cyn vs Malware (Murder Drones vs Ben 10) Ben says it is a new one to him. Him and liam said interesting in sync. Seems cool. Doesn’t remember much about malware.

Double vs Envy (Skullgirls vs Fullmetal Alchemist) Really love the creative thumbnail with the different eyeballs and body morphing. Is a bit hard to focus on. Loves “a huge bodycount” as a connection.

Boomstar vs Asher Mora (Dungeons & Death Battle: Spelljammer vs RWBY: The Grimm Campaign) This one is for Chad specifically because they are his characters. Wanted to sneak Asher into RWBY but never got a chance. Everything they did in “Grimm Campaign” took place before volume 1 and is cannon to the world of rwby. Chad is really pleased about seeing this. Talks about Asher’s weapon is a Sword Breaker + Grappling hook. Super Chat says “Isn’t it crazy we don’t have an official rwby ttrpg” Ben thought Grimm Campaign was published because it had a whole set of rules and talked to wizards of the coast about it. Says someone named Cody from Rooster Teeth probably still has everything for it. Chad said it was one of his favorite things to do at rooster teeth, and everything in there was cannon and learned a bunch of new lore for rwby, but it was locked behind a paywall subscription unfortunately. Has to be published somewhere because so much work was put into it, especially some edits on the video. Said they might try to track cody down and get it.

Springtap vs Junko (FNAF vs Dangonronpa) Talked about this before. It is great and works really well. Loves the art and thumbnails used, saying they would probably use the same thumbnail if this was official. 

Melinoe vs Absolute Wonder Woman (Hades vs DC Comics) Needs to read Absolute WonderWoman. Liam said the Absolute comics he read are great, with martian manhunter being one of his top comics ever and batman is close. Really cool takes on the characters. Thinks the match up makes sense. 

Composite Maleficent vs Composite Jafar (Sleeping Beauty vs Aladdin) They really like this idea. Wonders if the composite makes a difference, like for Maleficent specifically. Asks if it is Kingdom Hearts is what they are doing. Would be Rad to animate. They ask if Luis will do “disney quality animation” jokingly. The submitter says the composite of both represents them much better, makes the fight more fair, and removes the genie issue.

Darth Maul vs Judge Gabranth (Star Wars vs Final Fantasy) Liam says the judges are represented very differently but does get the connection. Star wars vs Final Fantasy is a wild series combo but does think it would work really well. Has talked about comparing the Force and classic magic systems. Darth Maul show coming out soon which Ben didn’t know about. Ben says darth maul is in more star wars media than vader at this point. 

Dendy vs Tsuyu (OK KO vs My Hero Academia) Everyone loves Tsu. Thinks it would be a very cute fight till one of them dies which all of them would be sad by. Talks about calcing Tsu strangling Mineta, with how long one usually takes to turn purple. Learns Dendy once hacked and reset the entire OK KO universe mid fight. 

Spider-Man vs Mecha Man (Marvel vs Dispatch) makes sense. Cool thumbnail. By one of the mods. Sam starts nitpicking the thumbnail with the coffee cup being upside-down and having steam moving down. A couple have played dispatch. Thinks Spidey still wins. 

Kylo Ren vs Edelgard (Star Wars vs Fire Emblem) Classic. They have talked about it before. It makes a lot of sense. Another idea of Classic fantasy/magic vs star wars Force. Enjoy the art with it.

Lobo vs Death’s Head (DC vs Transformers/Doctor who/marvel) talked about this recently near the end of last year ballot. They were originally confused on how DH was part of all those universes and thought it was a mistake but found out he is. Probably means he is absurd. Few things cooler than a bounty hunter fight (it is how death battle started after all)

Korra vs Delsin (Legend of Korra vs InFAMOUS) talked about this a bunch. It’s pretty cool. The studio should make another InFAMOUS. Sam misses working in game stuff where they tried to bribe you with different game merch. 

Noah & Mio vs Kat & Raven (Xenoblade Chronicles vs Gravity Rush) Talks about Gravity Rush being so cool, especially with the mechanics. No one has beat it but they do enjoy it. Seeing it in a death battle suggestion is really neat, especially against Xenoblade as a really cool pairing.

1qgit37,https://www.reddit.com/r/latteart/comments/1qgit37/beginner_question_about_frothing/,Beginner question about frothing,"I do very decent espresso shots at least myself very happy with them. I never liked frothing milk and pouring into my coffee, even though I like drinking lattes. My way is warming up milk in microwave and just add to shot. Main reason behind is that whenever I tired frothing milk on my Breville duo temp pro using 2% milk in stock pitcher it never turned out paint like consistency. Usually it’s either more froth or less.. I have watched many videos about technique but nothing worked so far. Another reason is that after all this coffee temperature is also very low to my taste.

Question:

1- Does pitcher matter, is it a very important thing for a beginner.

2- is it recommended to change steaming nozzle from one hole to something like 3 or 4. Does it improve frothing..

3- does it matter if I keep steaming milk a longer to make milk warmer.

4- is it important to use those wider cups, I use mugs which are not very wide on top and they are a little taller than usually seen wide cups. Again the reason not to use them is they make my coffee feel cold.

Thanks appreciate input from all you experts :)",1,1768766701.0,latteart,0,1.0,False

With Ben, Sam, Chad, Liam, and Luis

Samus vs Kai’sa (Metroid vs League of Legends) It’s fine. Sam explain’s Kai’sa’s deal. Her symbiote thing is similar to samus’s new suits. Chad said Kai’sa is such a complicated character to try and figure out due to her level up thing. They get it and thinks it is cool. 

Robbie Reyes vs Devilman (Marvel vs Devilman) Devilman is a classic. Liam would love to look into devilman. Ben says if ghost rider comes back it would be cool to do robbie. Luis says as long as batman has more match ups anyone can come back for more match ups. 

Swin Abel vs Throne Anguis (Trails in Reverie vs Octopath Traveler 2) the names really seem strange. Especially “Swin Abel” gets a lot of jokes about his name. They have no idea who Swin is but would like to explore Octopath. Sam clarifies “Octopath 2, because Octopath 1 is not a good game. Fight me”

Kamina vs Gustav (Gurren Laggan vs Expedition 33) Don’t want to read the connections because there is a big spoiler/part is blocked out. They know what the spoiler is though. Sam says Kamina should scale way higher than gustav, but Liam says Kamina dies before things get crazy. Liam also says “but so does gustav” which Sam says “i assume that is what the spoiler was. Thanks liam.” but they quickly check the spoiler and see it doesn’t talk about that.

Ultra Instinct Shaggy vs Matt (Scooby Doo vs Wii Sports) is called a joke battle in the description. They say Matt is the final boss for every wii sport thing not just boxing. Both are memes

Qrow vs Eda (RWBY vs The Owl House) talked about this before. They get the theme. They carry a “Bird-den” (burden). Makes sense

Yodaka vs Gabimaru (Shinobi Undercover vs Hell’s Paradise) Don’t know about either franchise. DJ knows Hell’s paradise but isn’t here today. The connections make sense. 

Mimic vs M3GAN (FNAF vs M3GAN) Thinks M3gan demolishes. Doesn’t know the mimic. Ben never saw M3gan and asks what she can do. If there is a third M3gan movie, they already have a three in the name so they screwed themselves.

Maelle vs Will (Clair Obscure vs Metaphor Refantazio) Has really cool art. “But the names are backwards and isn’t a thumbnail so you lost points” in Sam’s imaginary points. They do like the art with the background. Doesn’t know how strong Will is but assumes he is pretty strong given he is an Atlas character. They are interested in Clair Obscure on the show, especially since Maelle was part of the champion island at the start.

Koseki Bijou vs Diancie (Hololive vs Pokemon) Yeah. They read the connections and makes sense. They don’t know either, or at least barely remember Diancie. Luis asks how would they research a hololive character and Sam says they would have to set a day limit for any research. As in anything beyond wouldn’t count and that the hololive character can’t just say “yeah i would win because i can also do this…” Chad reads the pokedex entry and thinks that is insane. 

Daredevil vs Takayuki Yagami (Marvel vs Judgement) Knows judgment is a yakuza spin off but none of them have played it. Connections are pretty on the nose and seems fun. Thinks Daredevil is a little stronger.

Marcy Wu vs Donatello (Amphibia vs TMNT 03) Thumbnail looked blue and Liam got confused thinking it was Leo at first. They like it and thinks it is cool. Chad says “This is one of the match ups where they would be best friends” and both have super forms which is fun. 

Rimuru vs Kumoko (That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime vs So I’m a Spider, So What) Thinks they talked about this. Chad said “throwing random vowels in these”. Thinks this is the biggest monster isekai match up. They had a pitch on this. See’s Rimuru requests a lot. Liam asks if the series are done or still continuing. Ben says they are finished or almost finished.

Zuko vs Kuai Liang/Sub Zero (Avatar the Last Airbender vs Mortal Kombat) Love the thumbnail. Makes perfect sense. Thinks Aang being the stand in for scorpion makes sense but is also hilarious given their personalities. As far as the many fire vs ice match ups, this one bangs. A Chatter mentions Mortal Kombat: Scorpion’s Revenge/Battle for the realm was done by the same animation studio as “The Legend of Korra” with said studio founder was an animation director for ATLA

Megumi Fushigoro vs Shiroha Fujino (Jujutsu Kaisen vs Nue’s Excorcist) Liam immediately says “fraud watch. Just kidding i don’t know about Shiroha”. The thumbnail showing their strongest monster throws them off in a way that really impressed them. Jokes about Megumi trying to summon Mahorahga over every little pressure. 

Captain Wayne vs Risky Boots (Captain Wayne-Vacation Desperation vs Shantae) “Who the hell is captain wayne?” loves the energy the thumbnail gives off. Jokes “when the shantae character is the only one we know”. Says they would love to bring in Risky Boots, let alone Shantae into the show but have no idea who Captain Wayne is. Captain Wayne has a perfect 5/5 on steam. Liam suggests Captain Wayne vs Boomstick due to Shotgun arm vs Shotgun Leg. 

Nemesis vs Magician (Resident Evil vs House of the Dead) Sam says this is the next Colex. This is the most loved match up by far on this with 62 hearts (liam says five more and starts to do a gesture with his hands, upsetting Sam). However he says if they make it, only those 62 would watch it. Chad tries to argue against that saying their generation loved house of the dead. Thinks it is the best thumbnail for this match up yet, but they would have to do a different one if official due to the gore on the Magician Render. Liam says they need more Sega Dreamcast era characters on death battle. 

Sailor Mercury vs Tecna (Sailor Moon vs Winx Club) Japanese magical girl vs american magical girl. They think they have had pitches for multiple of this series combination. Chad says they ought to do winx one of these days. Sam says the winx design is the inspiration for unhinged plastic surgeons. 

Frieren vs Salem (Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End vs RWBY) Interesting contrast. Wants to do a Frieren episode and Liam says this makes sense. Ben isn’t convinced it is a good match up saying it is just based on their motivations in the story and not like in a battle or anything. Wonders if both of their magic would be interesting to see in a fight. Like is there an interesting way their magic can play off each other. “Because as far as death battle is concerned, who cares if they are really old ladies” also doesn’t remember if salem can do anything besides make monsters come out of the ground. 

GTA 5 Crew vs The PAYDAY Gang (GTA vs PAYDAY) Sam says he thinks the payday gang just gets hurt by bullets while the GTA crew can fall out of helicopters and get blown up. Sam does a goof and says the GTA crew has personalities while the PAYDAY gang is just silent player characters. Likes the idea of two bank heist teams trying to rob the same bank at the same time and having to kill eachother. Insane they haven’t done a GTA fight and is something they definitely should do. A chatter lets sam know the Payday gang has light speed reactions and fought inter-dimensional aliens, which sam responds “well fuck me then”.

Dan Kuso vs Gingka Hagane (Bakugan vs Beyblade) “Now We’re talking”. Luis really wants to do beyblade, especially to use the moses thing. Sam talks about staying with his partner’s family in england once and their child was really into beyblade, and would have a cute child British version of “let it rip”. Wants to do Beyblade money matches for a in person nightly brew stream. They all buy beyblades and customize them. Wants to get a Boomstick Audio trigger for “3,2,1 LET IT RIP”. “Anyways Bakugan also a thing.” (I’m sad that bakugan was reduced to that in the discussion) 

Cyn vs Malware (Murder Drones vs Ben 10) Ben says it is a new one to him. Him and liam said interesting in sync. Seems cool. Doesn’t remember much about malware.

Double vs Envy (Skullgirls vs Fullmetal Alchemist) Really love the creative thumbnail with the different eyeballs and body morphing. Is a bit hard to focus on. Loves “a huge bodycount” as a connection.

Boomstar vs Asher Mora (Dungeons & Death Battle: Spelljammer vs RWBY: The Grimm Campaign) This one is for Chad specifically because they are his characters. Wanted to sneak Asher into RWBY but never got a chance. Everything they did in “Grimm Campaign” took place before volume 1 and is cannon to the world of rwby. Chad is really pleased about seeing this. Talks about Asher’s weapon is a Sword Breaker + Grappling hook. Super Chat says “Isn’t it crazy we don’t have an official rwby ttrpg” Ben thought Grimm Campaign was published because it had a whole set of rules and talked to wizards of the coast about it. Says someone named Cody from Rooster Teeth probably still has everything for it. Chad said it was one of his favorite things to do at rooster teeth, and everything in there was cannon and learned a bunch of new lore for rwby, but it was locked behind a paywall subscription unfortunately. Has to be published somewhere because so much work was put into it, especially some edits on the video. Said they might try to track cody down and get it.

Springtap vs Junko (FNAF vs Dangonronpa) Talked about this before. It is great and works really well. Loves the art and thumbnails used, saying they would probably use the same thumbnail if this was official. 

Melinoe vs Absolute Wonder Woman (Hades vs DC Comics) Needs to read Absolute WonderWoman. Liam said the Absolute comics he read are great, with martian manhunter being one of his top comics ever and batman is close. Really cool takes on the characters. Thinks the match up makes sense. 

Composite Maleficent vs Composite Jafar (Sleeping Beauty vs Aladdin) They really like this idea. Wonders if the composite makes a difference, like for Maleficent specifically. Asks if it is Kingdom Hearts is what they are doing. Would be Rad to animate. They ask if Luis will do “disney quality animation” jokingly. The submitter says the composite of both represents them much better, makes the fight more fair, and removes the genie issue.

Darth Maul vs Judge Gabranth (Star Wars vs Final Fantasy) Liam says the judges are represented very differently but does get the connection. Star wars vs Final Fantasy is a wild series combo but does think it would work really well. Has talked about comparing the Force and classic magic systems. Darth Maul show coming out soon which Ben didn’t know about. Ben says darth maul is in more star wars media than vader at this point. 

Dendy vs Tsuyu (OK KO vs My Hero Academia) Everyone loves Tsu. Thinks it would be a very cute fight till one of them dies which all of them would be sad by. Talks about calcing Tsu strangling Mineta, with how long one usually takes to turn purple. Learns Dendy once hacked and reset the entire OK KO universe mid fight. 

Spider-Man vs Mecha Man (Marvel vs Dispatch) makes sense. Cool thumbnail. By one of the mods. Sam starts nitpicking the thumbnail with the coffee cup being upside-down and having steam moving down. A couple have played dispatch. Thinks Spidey still wins. 

Kylo Ren vs Edelgard (Star Wars vs Fire Emblem) Classic. They have talked about it before. It makes a lot of sense. Another idea of Classic fantasy/magic vs star wars Force. Enjoy the art with it.

Lobo vs Death’s Head (DC vs Transformers/Doctor who/marvel) talked about this recently near the end of last year ballot. They were originally confused on how DH was part of all those universes and thought it was a mistake but found out he is. Probably means he is absurd. Few things cooler than a bounty hunter fight (it is how death battle started after all)

Noah & Mio vs Kat & Raven (Xenoblade Chronicles vs Gravity Rush) Talks about Gravity Rush being so cool, especially with the mechanics. No one has beat it but they do enjoy it. Seeing it in a death battle suggestion is really neat, especially against Xenoblade as a really cool pairing.

1qgishs,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1qgishs/time_looped_chapter_194/,[Time Looped] - Chapter 194,"“Should I tell the rest?” Will asked the bathroom mirror.

For the last thirty seconds, he had been carefully examining the map, especially the area of the zoo. Even with two eyes at his disposal, there was no indication of anything interesting being there. Even the merchant wasn’t marked. Clearly, more special boosting skills were needed for that information to be revealed.

The zoo itself could hardly be called a proper zoo. It was small, old, and only there because of some unspoken rule that every semi-large city needed one. Will remembered being taken there as a child, but even then, he didn’t particularly like it. The animals were few and unimpressive, the buildings were old, and the staff looked like they could be doing anything else. The only exotic thing had been the aquarium, but that had been closed down a few years ago due to lack of species selection.

Foxes, along with bears and wolves, were viewed as the only animals that were cheap enough to obtain and exotic enough to an urban population to merit showing. Thinking about it, it was the perfect place for a merchant to hide.

 

**\[Merchant challenges are group challenges\]**

 

A message appeared on the mirror. The guide wasn’t being particularly helpful lately.

When Jess had told him about the secret challenge, she had likely done so in confidence. On the other hand, she hadn’t explicitly warned him to go alone. In Will’s experience, that was something that participants tended to share early on. The only specifics were the time and the number of coins he had to offer. Everything else was up for grabs.

Will’s phone pinged. Alex, of all people, had sent him a text wondering where he was. That was new. Usually, the goofball kept a low profile.

Taking one final glance at the mirror, Will went into the corridor. The coach was visible a short distance away. Thankfully, he had honed in on a new set of targets, leaving Will in the clear. That left the boy a few minutes before the temps started arriving at the classroom.

Using his sprint and conceal, he rushed along the hallway and into the arts class. As expected, all three members of his party were there.

“What happened?” Jace was the one who asked. Based on the other’s intense glares, they were itching to know as well.

“Sorry, I was checking something, and I lost track of time.”

“Yesterday,” the jock clarified. “You skipped class.”

Right, there was that. There were several ways Will could go about this. The truth was risky. He didn’t want to get Jess involved with eternity again unless he had to. An outright lie was also risky. There were enough ways for them to catch him out. For all he knew, the goofball could have sent an army of mirror copies to spy on him the entire loop.

“I can’t tell you right now,” he admitted. “But I can say that I found us a challenge.”

That stirred interest. Helen glanced at her mirror fragment, then put it away and stood up. About a minute remained left before her friends arrived, giving her just enough time to administer some knightly punishment should she decide.

Silently, she walked up to Will.

“Tell me,” she said in a seemingly calm fashion.

“A hidden merchant challenge,” Will explained. “We have to be at the zoo at midnight. That’s when the mirror will appear.”

“For real?” Alex shook his head. “Sounds sus.”

“There’s no guarantee, but the reward will be worth it.” Will tried to explain. “It’s a hidden challenge, so all rewards are worthwhile.”

“And it has nothing to do with the alliance offer you got?” Helen crossed her arms. “Or the archer?”

“It’s got nothing to do with that.” For once, Will was telling the truth. “There were no deals, no favors, no debts. I just know about it. It’ll probably be tough, so it’ll be a good way to work on our coordination.”

That didn’t come out right, but everyone knew what the boy meant. Jace looked out of the window. Alex shrugged, taking a semi-crumpled muffin out of his pocket. Even Helen’s facial features softened slightly.

“Midnight,” she said. “We’ll have to extend our loop by a lot.”

“Won’t be the first time. Just like when we dealt with the goblin fuckers during the tutorial.”

“We’ll also need to gear up. As I said, it might be tough.”

“Stoner, everything from here on will be tough. I did some reading on the message board. The last time there was a reward phase, everyone went crazy. Those that didn’t stand a chance of reaching the top ten went out of their way to do favors for those that could.”

“There’s that, too.” Will all but brushed the concern aside. “A bigger issue is the challenges. We can’t afford doing simple ones, even if more emerge. We have to take on big, hidden ones. That means we must complete them in one go.”

“Pfft!” Alex snorted. “No way, bro. I know we’re good, but we aren’t lucky enough to pull that off. Remember the squire? Now many goes did we need to complete that? Run the numbers for five loops per challenge. That means we can get about ten. If we do, that’ll be fire.”

On a technical level, the thief was right. Will even estimated that they’d take about ten loops per challenge. The arithmetic changed when prediction loops were involved. Of course, that meant that he’d have to rest a loop or two between challenges.

“We might only have one try,” Will said. “That’s why we have to be ready and focused. The midnight challenge had the lowest risk and the greatest reward,” he lied. “We’ll see how things go, then see how to proceed.”

It wasn’t a very detailed plan, but the group had gone through this before, so no further explanations were needed. As other students started arriving, the party went back to playing their daily roles. Unlike previous loops, all of them kept a low profile, causing no disturbances, but not shining with brilliance, either. With the exception of Helen, all levitated towards acceptable mediocrity.

School ended with no surprises. Every now and again the four would discreetly check their mirror fragments, monitoring the latest events of eternity. It was safe to say that at present, trust among participants had reached an all-time low. The only people who posted public messages on the board were selling, or in a few instances, buying items and information. Someone openly offered their services for hire come the contest phase. There was some speculation that it could be Spenser, though the class name was hidden.

Jace had toyed around with the notion of wasting a few hundred coins just to try to find out who stood behind the offer, but was quickly dissuaded.

In the early afternoon, the group scattered to level up and get any items and materials they needed. Jace was the first to go with the promise he’d meet the rest at the zoo around eleven. Knowing him, he was probably off to get materials for even more explosive weapons. For better or worse, the jock shattered the mold of what crafters were expected to be.

Helen also left for her home. Having experienced long loops, she was most accustomed to returning to a semblance of everyday life. That left Will and Alex.

“So, what now?” the rogue asked. “Do we go through some reading materials?”

“Nah, this isn’t homework, bro. When we do it, we must be serious.”

“Yeah, right.”

“You still think I’m crazy.”

“No,” Will looked Alex in the eye. “I know you’re obsessed. I’m just trying to figure out whether you’re right about it.”

The goofball laughed.

“There’s hope for you yet.”

“It all comes down to the reward phase.”

“Yep.” The thief took out a handful of muffins from his pocket and chomped down on one. “That’s when they’ll show up.”

“Who’s the most dangerous?”

“If I knew that, I wouldn’t be going through Danny’s dream notes. Has to be one of the three. The tamer, the bard, or the necromancer.”

*Or so I’ve been hearing.* “Maybe we’ll get something tonight to help us find out.”

With nothing particularly left to do, the pair decided to level up together. It was a lot faster and improved their coordination to a certain degree.

 

**CAPE COMBAT**

**Use capes or pieces of large cloth in battle to distract and defend against enemies while concealing your own attacks.**

 

**RIP SLASH**

**Perform a medium-powered slash that cuts through fabric and flesh.**

 

**UNDERWATER COMBAT**

**Fight underwater with no additional movement penalties or restrictions.**

 

Will looked at his five-level rogue skills. Up to now, he hadn’t used a single one of them. Not that they were bad, but there had never been an occasion. He had been tempted to use the pack level boosts to max out his class, as Jess had said. Unfortunately, the synergies between classes were far too good to ignore. One level had to be dedicated to the clairvoyant and several more to the crafter. Of the few that remained, Will chose to boost his enchanter.

*I really need more tokens*, the boy thought.

“Wow, a permanent,” Alex said, amused.

“What did you get?” Will glanced at him over his shoulder.

“Smoke resistance,” the goofball replied from the mirror on the opposite side of the room. “If I ever get trapped in a burning building, I won’t die from the smoke.”

“That’s dark.”

“But appropriate. You said that we’re going on a *fire* fox challenge. Burning is a real possibility,” Alex added with a chuckle.

The joke was so stupid that Will couldn’t help but laugh as well. Even now, the thief had a way of reducing tension. Of course, the momentary calm brought new questions.

“Do you think we’ll make it?” Will asked. “To the reward phase, I mean.”

“There’s a chance. But, no. We’re too weak to win, too strong to be left alone. Maybe if the rest were like Gen and the loser alliance, we’d have better odds. There are a lot of strong participants, even with the archer out of the picture. And that’s just our reality.”

There was that. The goblins were a constant nuisance. The charm-user faction wasn’t a pushover, either. Then, there were the elves.

Will walked away from the mirror. The letters instantly faded away. This marked all the effective leveling they could do for the loop. The next boost required thirty-two killed wolves, which was a bit too much, given there were two of them.

The remaining hours of the night were spent in casual walking about the city. During that time, Will kept looking around for other hidden participants. Initially, his eye didn’t reveal anything… until it suddenly did.

 

**NORMAN REDDY (Former participant)**

**Current Skills: NONE**

 

A message appeared above the head of a young man sitting in a Starbucks. He looked like a college student, tapping away on his laptop, with two large cups of steaming coffee at arm’s length. Looking at him, not a person would suspect that at some point he’d had skills and powers that defied reason. Sadly, by the looks of it, neither did he. Unlike Jess and Ely’s case, the man hadn’t retained any skills, not even the ability to remember his loops.

“Something wrong?” Alex asked, following Will’s glance. “Don’t worry, he’s not a participant. Just someone taking advantage of the twenty-four-hour coffee and Wi-Fi service.”

“It’s not that,” Will lied. “I was thinking of something.”

The explanation was vague enough that it didn’t merit a response.

“I need to go for a bit,” Will stood up from their table and went to the restroom. It was cleaner than most he’d seen, though still wouldn’t be his first choice. The only saving grace was that the general place was public enough so it wouldn’t attract too much attention.

Putting the lid down, Will sat on it, then leaned back.

 

**PREDICTION LOOP**

 

The boy found himself standing up half a step away from his real self.

 

**Need a favor**

 

Will texted Lucas. For several long seconds, he kept staring at his phone until an answer finally appeared.

 

**?**

**At the Starbucks near the zoo. Need protection for the night**

**?!? I’m a temp**

**I know. Using prediction loop. Watch over me till I’m done**

 

Lucas didn’t respond.

 

**I’ll owe you one**

 

Will added. The promise was intended for Lucas’ looped self, but apparently that was good enough since the comment received a thumbs up reaction in response.

Now that one concern had been alleviated, it was time to focus on the main task.

1qgisb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/askliberals/comments/1qgisb9/do_you_think_we_will_ever_be_able_to_overcome_the/,Do you think we will ever be able to overcome the “capitalism vs socialism”debate,"Brace yourself, this is wordy and heavily analytical. No it’s not f’ing AI. But it’s not a typical rhetorical post either. It’s easier if you know something about structural functionalism and conflict theory in sociology and most people don’t. 

My thesis here is a consideration of Structural Functionalism rather than conflict theory as the framework to engage with the forces of civilization. The premise is that structural functionalism is superior. My Thesis here is not primarily intended to present an ideological socio-political position but rather to recommend a reframing of the approach to the discussion, and a consideration of the limitations of the central terms we use in this discourse. The caveat here is that in pursuit of my own logic, by bias shows and its toward liberal democracy and against other certain economically puerile ideas. I don’t think it necessary to discus that rather than schools of social theory, but I realize that this sub is about the ideological collision so it’s likely the only response I will get. In any case, here it is: 

In my opinion the attempt to unify the contradictions of “capitalism” with conflict theory (Marx) was a failure. The implication of Godel’s Theorem to me, is that it can be hard to say things that are true with natural language and hard to say things that are meaningful with mathematical language.

When we see contradiction in natural language we should question how we are defining our terms. If we want to know “who shaves the barber” our language has to be incisive enough. My premise is that it currently is not in regards to the terms “capitalism” and “socialism” This is a thought exercise. It’s not tractable to redefine “capitalism” outside its colloquial definition.

If you consider a structural functionalist framework rather than conflict theory framework, you could make progress. You could say “force x” functions in all civilizations. You could say “force x” is meritocracy and equality of opportunity. The oppositional “force-y” would be humanism and equity. You can’t weigh merit and simultaneously reduce virtues to their humanist basis. You can’t provide equality of opportunity and produce equity. They are oppositional forces. When these forces are implemented through institutions of power, those institutions have to be able to justify their power.

We won’t sell the world on replacing “capitalism” definition for how I defined “force x”. Force x is only dissolved by opposing forces. It doesn’t cause its own dissolution in a vacuum. It’s not the only force at play. As mentioned, All will continue to see “capitalism” through its colloquial definition about class struggle in perpetuity ad-nauseam. 

A term like “Late stage capitalism” lives in the obscure side of conflict theory “capitalism” definition. Never will people agree that it’s a thing. Like all discourse around this contradictory term, when people say “capitalism” they are usually talking about something else. Usually it’s “will call it force Z” The consolidation of wealth and power (oppositional to democracy) when you say “late stage capitalism” you might mean finaincialization of economic activity that is growth dependent. You might be referencing to the pattern of rise and fall of Empirial power. You can see this reflected best in the aesthetics of low, middle, high periods in art and architecture history and theory. It’s a real thing, but its relationship to capitalism is perhaps indirect. One could argue otherwise I’ve seen it done, but not convincingly. History doesn’t repeat, it rhymes. 

If you frame things in terms of class conflict or the incidental collision of industrialization with Empirialism, you may miss the point of the dynamic of meritocracy and humanism, the dynamics of equity and equality. These are the problems we would try to solve, if we could find the language to do so. 

Rather than the goal be an ideological adherence to “capitalism” or “socialism” I think we would do better to make liberal democracy work. And by that I do not mean “neoliberal economic policy” which is neither new, nor liberal. However, we could make it more so. We can do this because we can use democracy to dismantle institutions that cannot justify their power. We can have strong enough institutions for common goals and shared purpose (aka ethics) to allow some maritime law, or we can have continental war. These institutions can only be strong and ethical if we operate a liberal democracy to produce them. That’s my conjecture anyway. 

“Socialism” doesn’t mean humanism and equity to many people, like the “force-y” When people use the term “socialism” , they are often coveting ideology. Ideology might look pretty, but history is bloody. Ideology is the black hole of intellectual thought space. Once in its orbit you cannot change your perspective. However, we will see in practice that institutions that promote say equity, must justify that power. In some scenarios it can be justified, in other cases it might not be and may cause negative selection of merit. 

And money. Getting rid of money to fix power dynamic. Is like saying you get rid of seratonin to fix a headache. Money is a regulatory pattern. Much like you can’t fix your economy by printing more money. It only looks good in the short term,… like concaine. It helps till you have inflation or burnout respectively. Thats why it doesn’t matter if you back it with gold or marbles. What matters is the regulatory pattern and its ability to lower the area under the curve (minimize cost).

And you talk about private property. That matters so far as the land is tied to the means of production. If it were ONLY so, I would think that would be disastrous. It may even be that if it is so, we draw toward a local maximum of feudalism. In a society where ideas are tied to the means of production, liberal democracy may be the local maximum. I suspect that to be the case

So hypothetically, if you took this idea of defining the forces of power in civilization , and do this in the service of building a Structural Functionalist framework. Take the idea of regulatory functions and separate them to model these systems. If we do this, and build a Functional Structuralist framework, what are the implications? We end up with a values based system. Structural Functionalist Theory meets its biggest opposition here. So I will steelman that argument. At the time it was developed, social mores were rather misogynistic compared to later. Values change. I’ll summarize what I think is the implication of this by saying; we mustn’t fall into the naturalistic phallacy or try to give up because we see values are relative. They aren’t relative if you pursue shared purpose, and that’s what ethics are by definition. We know that mores aren’t static as they deal with adaptation and progression. We can however, define the function of these values in a way that we can analyze mores better. That is the premise. The pitfall of relativism is the same here as it is when applied to any thoughts. It ranges from the uncontested obvious point to the intellectual castration and nihilism of the “relativist” position. It seems to me that being value based is actually a strength as well as a weakness. It seems like a sociopath-political system for ethics, probably should be values based. The tension between the traditional and the progressive must be addressed. The over-use of traditionalism being the naturalistic fallacy. Of course I’d expect there are other challenges that I’d like to hear. The arguments I hear are just various forms of not liking that it has a quality of tautology. 

So what’s an example of this? I think MLK gives us the best example of applying Stuctural Functionalism to socio-political analysis. Martin Luther King Jr. viewed institutional power not as an abstract entity, but as a system that required direct action. 

“You reach for a bar of soap, and that's given to you at the hands of a Frenchman. And then you go into the kitchen to drink your coffee for the morning, and that's poured into your cup by a South American. And maybe you want tea: that's poured into your cup by a Chinese.

Or maybe you're desirous of having cocoa for breakfast, and that's poured in your cup by a West African. And then you reach over for your toast, and that's given to you at the hands of an English-speaking farmer, not to mention the baker.

And before you finish eating breakfast in the morning, you've depended on more than half of the world. This is the way our universe is structured, it is its interrelated quality. We aren't going to have peace on earth until we recognize this basic fact of the interrelated structure of all reality...""

\\\\\\\~Martin Luther King, Jr.

Dec. 25, 1967

This speech is a good example, but I think the Structural Functionalist approach permeated all of Kings arguments and how he viewed institutional power. He fought for an ecumenical approach over a sectorial, but he applied rationalism in understanding how to engage institutional power and I think he was more productive in implementation of socio-political ethics than Marx. At least that’s my perspective. ",2,1768766651.0,askliberals,1,1.0,False

“Should I tell the rest?” Will asked the bathroom mirror.

For the last thirty seconds, he had been carefully examining the map, especially the area of the zoo. Even with two eyes at his disposal, there was no indication of anything interesting being there. Even the merchant wasn’t marked. Clearly, more special boosting skills were needed for that information to be revealed.

The zoo itself could hardly be called a proper zoo. It was small, old, and only there because of some unspoken rule that every semi-large city needed one. Will remembered being taken there as a child, but even then, he didn’t particularly like it. The animals were few and unimpressive, the buildings were old, and the staff looked like they could be doing anything else. The only exotic thing had been the aquarium, but that had been closed down a few years ago due to lack of species selection.

Foxes, along with bears and wolves, were viewed as the only animals that were cheap enough to obtain and exotic enough to an urban population to merit showing. Thinking about it, it was the perfect place for a merchant to hide.

 

**\[Merchant challenges are group challenges\]**

 

A message appeared on the mirror. The guide wasn’t being particularly helpful lately.

When Jess had told him about the secret challenge, she had likely done so in confidence. On the other hand, she hadn’t explicitly warned him to go alone. In Will’s experience, that was something that participants tended to share early on. The only specifics were the time and the number of coins he had to offer. Everything else was up for grabs.

Will’s phone pinged. Alex, of all people, had sent him a text wondering where he was. That was new. Usually, the goofball kept a low profile.

Taking one final glance at the mirror, Will went into the corridor. The coach was visible a short distance away. Thankfully, he had honed in on a new set of targets, leaving Will in the clear. That left the boy a few minutes before the temps started arriving at the classroom.

Using his sprint and conceal, he rushed along the hallway and into the arts class. As expected, all three members of his party were there.

“What happened?” Jace was the one who asked. Based on the other’s intense glares, they were itching to know as well.

“Sorry, I was checking something, and I lost track of time.”

“Yesterday,” the jock clarified. “You skipped class.”

Right, there was that. There were several ways Will could go about this. The truth was risky. He didn’t want to get Jess involved with eternity again unless he had to. An outright lie was also risky. There were enough ways for them to catch him out. For all he knew, the goofball could have sent an army of mirror copies to spy on him the entire loop.

“I can’t tell you right now,” he admitted. “But I can say that I found us a challenge.”

That stirred interest. Helen glanced at her mirror fragment, then put it away and stood up. About a minute remained left before her friends arrived, giving her just enough time to administer some knightly punishment should she decide.

Silently, she walked up to Will.

“Tell me,” she said in a seemingly calm fashion.

“A hidden merchant challenge,” Will explained. “We have to be at the zoo at midnight. That’s when the mirror will appear.”

“For real?” Alex shook his head. “Sounds sus.”

“There’s no guarantee, but the reward will be worth it.” Will tried to explain. “It’s a hidden challenge, so all rewards are worthwhile.”

“And it has nothing to do with the alliance offer you got?” Helen crossed her arms. “Or the archer?”

“It’s got nothing to do with that.” For once, Will was telling the truth. “There were no deals, no favors, no debts. I just know about it. It’ll probably be tough, so it’ll be a good way to work on our coordination.”

That didn’t come out right, but everyone knew what the boy meant. Jace looked out of the window. Alex shrugged, taking a semi-crumpled muffin out of his pocket. Even Helen’s facial features softened slightly.

“Midnight,” she said. “We’ll have to extend our loop by a lot.”

“Won’t be the first time. Just like when we dealt with the goblin fuckers during the tutorial.”

“We’ll also need to gear up. As I said, it might be tough.”

“Stoner, everything from here on will be tough. I did some reading on the message board. The last time there was a reward phase, everyone went crazy. Those that didn’t stand a chance of reaching the top ten went out of their way to do favors for those that could.”

“There’s that, too.” Will all but brushed the concern aside. “A bigger issue is the challenges. We can’t afford doing simple ones, even if more emerge. We have to take on big, hidden ones. That means we must complete them in one go.”

“Pfft!” Alex snorted. “No way, bro. I know we’re good, but we aren’t lucky enough to pull that off. Remember the squire? Now many goes did we need to complete that? Run the numbers for five loops per challenge. That means we can get about ten. If we do, that’ll be fire.”

On a technical level, the thief was right. Will even estimated that they’d take about ten loops per challenge. The arithmetic changed when prediction loops were involved. Of course, that meant that he’d have to rest a loop or two between challenges.

“We might only have one try,” Will said. “That’s why we have to be ready and focused. The midnight challenge had the lowest risk and the greatest reward,” he lied. “We’ll see how things go, then see how to proceed.”

It wasn’t a very detailed plan, but the group had gone through this before, so no further explanations were needed. As other students started arriving, the party went back to playing their daily roles. Unlike previous loops, all of them kept a low profile, causing no disturbances, but not shining with brilliance, either. With the exception of Helen, all levitated towards acceptable mediocrity.

School ended with no surprises. Every now and again the four would discreetly check their mirror fragments, monitoring the latest events of eternity. It was safe to say that at present, trust among participants had reached an all-time low. The only people who posted public messages on the board were selling, or in a few instances, buying items and information. Someone openly offered their services for hire come the contest phase. There was some speculation that it could be Spenser, though the class name was hidden.

Jace had toyed around with the notion of wasting a few hundred coins just to try to find out who stood behind the offer, but was quickly dissuaded.

In the early afternoon, the group scattered to level up and get any items and materials they needed. Jace was the first to go with the promise he’d meet the rest at the zoo around eleven. Knowing him, he was probably off to get materials for even more explosive weapons. For better or worse, the jock shattered the mold of what crafters were expected to be.

Helen also left for her home. Having experienced long loops, she was most accustomed to returning to a semblance of everyday life. That left Will and Alex.

“So, what now?” the rogue asked. “Do we go through some reading materials?”

“Nah, this isn’t homework, bro. When we do it, we must be serious.”

“Yeah, right.”

“You still think I’m crazy.”

“No,” Will looked Alex in the eye. “I know you’re obsessed. I’m just trying to figure out whether you’re right about it.”

The goofball laughed.

“There’s hope for you yet.”

“It all comes down to the reward phase.”

“Yep.” The thief took out a handful of muffins from his pocket and chomped down on one. “That’s when they’ll show up.”

“Who’s the most dangerous?”

“If I knew that, I wouldn’t be going through Danny’s dream notes. Has to be one of the three. The tamer, the bard, or the necromancer.”

*Or so I’ve been hearing.* “Maybe we’ll get something tonight to help us find out.”

With nothing particularly left to do, the pair decided to level up together. It was a lot faster and improved their coordination to a certain degree.

 

**CAPE COMBAT**

**Use capes or pieces of large cloth in battle to distract and defend against enemies while concealing your own attacks.**

 

**RIP SLASH**

**Perform a medium-powered slash that cuts through fabric and flesh.**

 

**UNDERWATER COMBAT**

**Fight underwater with no additional movement penalties or restrictions.**

 

Will looked at his five-level rogue skills. Up to now, he hadn’t used a single one of them. Not that they were bad, but there had never been an occasion. He had been tempted to use the pack level boosts to max out his class, as Jess had said. Unfortunately, the synergies between classes were far too good to ignore. One level had to be dedicated to the clairvoyant and several more to the crafter. Of the few that remained, Will chose to boost his enchanter.

*I really need more tokens*, the boy thought.

“Wow, a permanent,” Alex said, amused.

“What did you get?” Will glanced at him over his shoulder.

“Smoke resistance,” the goofball replied from the mirror on the opposite side of the room. “If I ever get trapped in a burning building, I won’t die from the smoke.”

“That’s dark.”

“But appropriate. You said that we’re going on a *fire* fox challenge. Burning is a real possibility,” Alex added with a chuckle.

The joke was so stupid that Will couldn’t help but laugh as well. Even now, the thief had a way of reducing tension. Of course, the momentary calm brought new questions.

“Do you think we’ll make it?” Will asked. “To the reward phase, I mean.”

“There’s a chance. But, no. We’re too weak to win, too strong to be left alone. Maybe if the rest were like Gen and the loser alliance, we’d have better odds. There are a lot of strong participants, even with the archer out of the picture. And that’s just our reality.”

There was that. The goblins were a constant nuisance. The charm-user faction wasn’t a pushover, either. Then, there were the elves.

Will walked away from the mirror. The letters instantly faded away. This marked all the effective leveling they could do for the loop. The next boost required thirty-two killed wolves, which was a bit too much, given there were two of them.

The remaining hours of the night were spent in casual walking about the city. During that time, Will kept looking around for other hidden participants. Initially, his eye didn’t reveal anything… until it suddenly did.

 

**NORMAN REDDY (Former participant)**

**Current Skills: NONE**

 

A message appeared above the head of a young man sitting in a Starbucks. He looked like a college student, tapping away on his laptop, with two large cups of steaming coffee at arm’s length. Looking at him, not a person would suspect that at some point he’d had skills and powers that defied reason. Sadly, by the looks of it, neither did he. Unlike Jess and Ely’s case, the man hadn’t retained any skills, not even the ability to remember his loops.

“Something wrong?” Alex asked, following Will’s glance. “Don’t worry, he’s not a participant. Just someone taking advantage of the twenty-four-hour coffee and Wi-Fi service.”

“It’s not that,” Will lied. “I was thinking of something.”

The explanation was vague enough that it didn’t merit a response.

“I need to go for a bit,” Will stood up from their table and went to the restroom. It was cleaner than most he’d seen, though still wouldn’t be his first choice. The only saving grace was that the general place was public enough so it wouldn’t attract too much attention.

Putting the lid down, Will sat on it, then leaned back.

 

**PREDICTION LOOP**

 

The boy found himself standing up half a step away from his real self.

 

**Need a favor**

 

Will texted Lucas. For several long seconds, he kept staring at his phone until an answer finally appeared.

 

**?**

**At the Starbucks near the zoo. Need protection for the night**

**?!? I’m a temp**

**I know. Using prediction loop. Watch over me till I’m done**

 

Lucas didn’t respond.

 

**I’ll owe you one**

 

Will added. The promise was intended for Lucas’ looped self, but apparently that was good enough since the comment received a thumbs up reaction in response.

Now that one concern had been alleviated, it was time to focus on the main task.

If you’ve ever felt like you’re just floating through life—constantly reactive, lacking boundaries, or just generally feeling 'undefined'—I see you. This state is exhausting because, without a defined framework, the world (and everyone in it) will define you by default.

We often think the fix is a grand purpose revelation. But healing and self-improvement rarely start with the massive 'What is my life's meaning?' question. They start with small, solid definitions.

Here is a practical tip: **The 15-Minute Daily Definition Audit.**

This isn't about productivity; it’s about drawing clear, energy-saving lines in the sand, one day at a time.

### The Action: Define Your Daily Perimeter (15 Minutes)

Every morning, before checking your emails or scrolling, dedicate 15 minutes to answering these three defining questions in a journal or voice note:

**1. What is My ONE Non-Negotiable “NO” Today? (The Boundary)**

This defines your protective perimeter. This 'No' is the barrier against the biggest energy drain you anticipate. It must be specific.
*   *Example:* “I will not check work email after 5 PM.”
*   *Example:* “I will not offer unsolicited advice to my partner/family member today.”
*   *Example:* “I will not agree to an unexpected coffee meeting.”

**2. What is My ONE Non-Negotiable “YES” Today? (The Self-Nourishment)**

This defines your internal investment. This 'Yes' is the definition of a specific, small act of self-care or intentionality.
*   *Example:* “I will move my body for 10 minutes, no matter how tired I feel.”
*   *Example:* “I will drink 3 full glasses of water before noon.”
*   *Example:* “I will stop and look out the window for 5 minutes during my lunch break.”

**3. Where is My “Defined Focus Zone?” (The Priority)**

If you could only accomplish one thing today that moves your life forward (not just maintenance), what would it be? This defines your direction for the day.
*   *Example:* “Today, I define success as completing the first draft of the proposal, regardless of how messy it is.”
*   *Example:* “Today, I define success as having a 20-minute, present conversation with my child.”

**Why This Works:**

When you start the day defining your own boundaries (your 'No') and your own priorities (your 'Yes' and 'Focus'), you stop being the passive recipient of life. You replace the feeling of being 'undefined' with the confidence of making intentional micro-choices. This habit builds your internal sense of self-trust faster than any abstract therapy session or self-help book.

INFP guy gets close to a ESFJ classmate. When I asked her out for a coffee, she didn’t say “no” directly. She dodged it in the moment and only the next day told me she’s “seeing someone”. Then she kept initiating a lot of warm, close one on one time (walks, texts, bus rides, emotional openness). Months later, in a face to face talk, she acted like it was all on me and that she had “told me thousands of times”. I sent ONE calm message saying it hurt and that she let it happen too. She blocked me everywhere with no reply. ESFJs, does this fit your conflict-avoidance / guilt patterns?

INFP guy here, I’m trying to make sense of a situation with a woman I’m 99% sure is ESFJ. I’m not here to bash her. I still care about her a lot, but I need some perspective on her behavior

At some point I asked her out for a coffee. In the moment, she didn’t say a clear “no”. She kind of dodged it with “I can’t right now, maybe later” a few times. Only the next day, face to face, she told me that she’s “seeing someone” and didn’t want to say it in front of her friend  
  
I accepted it, told her I understood, and said I’d still like to get to know her. She gave me her Instagram and we started texting

Here’s where it gets *confusing* for me:

\- Even after telling me she’s seeing someone, she kept initiating conversations with me – both in chat and in person

\- She remembered tiny details about my life, asked about my plans, my family, my future in this country, etc.

\- We started taking little walks together after class, going to the store, riding the bus together, walking her home

\- There was a lot of physical closeness (walking side by side, bumping into each other, lingering at the door, my hand on her wrist/hand briefly, etc.), and a lot of emotional openness from her

\- One morning she pointed out another pair and said “oh look, what a cute couple”, looking at me with that “light in her eyes”. The vibe between us in that moment felt very… similar

I’m not naive, I know about projection and limerence. But this did not feel one-sided. She chose to spend time with me, many times, when she absolutely didn’t have to. She also told me she had been afraid she wouldn’t have any friends here and I stepped in on that front: walked her home to make sure she was safe, supported her with her exam stress, told her I cared, etc.  
  
There were also moments like:

\- Her letting me hold her hand for a few seconds when she said her hands were cold and only pulling away when it became obviously more “romantic”

\- Quiet tension after me holding her wrist, followed by her not cutting me off and going back to texting like nothing broke

\- She did a full personality test because I asked, which I believe is not something you do for a random classmate, right?

One more thing that really confuses me: after that initial “I’m seeing someone”, she basically never brought him up again

When she talked about her future plans (visiting a friend in England, visiting family, helping another friend in crisis, coming back to our city and looking for a job), there was zero mention of him. No “we”, no shared plans, nothing. The “relationship” only came back as a reason when I confronted her, not as a living part of her everyday life

At some point, after a trip she started to pull away: Slower replies, more distant tone, still warm sometimes, but more avoidant overall. Meanwhile I had already told her, that I cared about her. I didn’t beg, didn’t pressure her to be with me. I just wanted clarity and honesty

Most recently, we literally ran into each other on a street corner having phone conversations. I saw shock in her eyes, adrenaline, maybe fear, maybe just surprise. We both quickly ended our calls. She defaulted to small talk

She said she was going shopping. I said I was heading home in the same direction. She was clearly trying to get away fast, very “flight mode”

As we started to split up, she threw over her shoulder “See you… I’ll see you when I see you”  
I answered something like: “You sure?”  
She didn’t really catch what I meant, just repeated that it’s “just a phrase”. I actually turned to leave… and then I couldn’t. I called her back

I said something along the lines of “Listen, if you wanna tell me to get lost, just do it. ”She replied that she didn’t tell me to get lost, just “see you”

I tried to be clear without attacking. I said I meant what I’d told her before; that I wanted to see her, that my feelings were real, but that I didn’t want to argue with her.  
That’s when she dropped:

\- “I told you I have a boyfriend”

\- “I respect my relationship”

\- “I told you thousands of times”

She also said something like “We didn’t have to make it awkward. We could’ve just said ‘hi’ and not talk at all.”

And something in the vein of “I don’t have a habit of hanging out with friends when I’m busy.”

The whole thing felt like she was erasing the fact that she also leaned into the connection, rewriting history as if I had forced everything and reducing me from “someone important she opened up to” to “just some guy from class who wanted too much”

I walked away from that conversation feeling like a crazy person who imagined everything or a problem that needed to be erased

Not even “a friend”, just some inconvenient emotional loose end.

After sitting with it for a while, I sent her this one message:

“Hey I don’t wanna start any fight or drama.  I just need you to know it really hurt when you made it sound like it was all on me. You let it all happen too.”

That’s it. No insults, no guilt-tripping, no “please talk to me”, no wall of text.

She didn’t reply at all. She just blocked me everywhere; both numbers, Instagram, everything. Total cut-off.

So, yeah.  
Thoughts, anyone please?

I think i'll slow down to a pace of 3-4 chapters per day, i'll tackle it more slowly

Chapter 195 : 9.6/10

Chapter 196 : 10/10

Chapter 197 : 100/10 (Probably my favorite chapter so far.. Just wow. insane)

(ch196) Wow.. Just wow.. I should've known Barbara's coffee scheme was a trap. I did get caught off guard by it, but damn, i didn't realise it could be changed towards them following Christopher.. Will Kate have to team up with the adults to defeat Christopher?? Also got.. Even Emilyko was brainwashed.. Ugh... This is terrible, beyond terrible.. 

To even think he's alive, too.. I thought the religion thing was initially worshipping the dead but seems i was wrong. This is REALLY bad.. But peak asf! 

(ch197) Okay, no way this was that good. It was all there too, i should've thought about it more... 

The Ghosts being Christopher's storytelling. Maryrose's and Edward's obviously overpowered soot powers, Maryrose's cooperation with Anthony, Gilbert randomly appearing and acting as a mastermind while arguably not being that strong a character before that..

I'd argue that the next step of his plan causing chaos with the hunt on the powerless incident and making children yearn for a savior was far less obvious than the others, but by catching onto maryrose's soot powers being big (Which i SOMEHOW didn't despite mentioning that her powers are OP after learning about the fragments of favor... aaaaaa) 

Also Anthony's certainty in the fact that ""Kate will soon beg to become his pupil"" is a hint on the fact that they're related AND the fact that Anthony probably did far more things behind the scenes

I really should've thought more about this, but oh well, it was a peak read regardless. Anthony being Kate's relative and a descendant of the mirror house is also pretty good writing. I kind of called it before he said it but after he mentioned others forming a family to get revenge  but it was kinda obvious by then so that isn't much

I feel like most mysteries are at this point, revealed, but oh well, this was still a peak read. This story genuienly managed to somehow surpass my expectations which were at an all time high already, that's just crazy

I think the main mystery is Joseph now. Is he aware the grandfather lost his power? Is him not doing anything or threatening Kate a sign of his awareness of Anthony's threat? In short.. Is his ignorance towards Edward's evidence a wordless hint to Kate that he's willing to cooperate against Anthony in some way, because he's more of a threat?? 

I think that's when Kate goes back to being behind the scenes actor. Since imo she isn't gonna go along with Anthony's methods - there's a chance the grandfather and christopher with some children he brainwashed fight it out together and Kate gets a somewhat of a chance to clear up whoever's left, but there's probably way more to it

First of all, Joseph is aware of Catherine's existence, since he said her name if i'm not wrong.  So yeah, he's probably aware of a rebellion that is going to begin in quite a bit. But won't Kate have to atleast pretend to go along with Anthony's plan to stand a chance?? Well.. Perhaps.. This is peak man, i can't wait to read the rebellion arc. 

Should be able to read 4 chapters today

Chapter 198 : 8.8/10

Chapter 199 : 9.6/10

Chapter 200 : 9.5/10

Chapter 201 : 9.7/10

Finished now. I Feel like i should've red 3 chapters today, afterall that's when the backstory ended. The 4th chapter makes me way too curious i might fasten up my face again, well, i think i'll hold off from contiuning for now

So, Joseph betrayed Alfred and the mirror family. Is he a hidden mastermind behind even the grandfather? Eh, i don't feel that way. It's rather interesting he gave up his position of power just to be come a 3rd floor shadow, as high of a rank that is, he doesn't even govern the shadows house

.. Unless that is actually the case, and he's a hidden mastermind behind the Shadows. 

Did he just go over the morphs transformation and the unification ritual? Well, probably.. But what if he's more of a Kate-like shadow - that was originally a human? Do we even know someone who's same as her? Perhaps, Maryrose? Eh, probably not.

Ugh why is Douglas so loveable rn? Just a little bit after Anthony's takeover and he already declares himself his ally, and besides that Doug is aswell.

It's pretty obvious why he's not going along with it all. ""Great master christopher"" + brainwashing is just the same formula that he figured to be malicious doing his talk with Edward. 

But.. Did he instantly un-brainwash Doug, or did he not drink the coffee in the first place? Physically, it would be hard to make him come back to his senses in such a low period of time. But him anticipating the brainwashing? That sounds too far fetched for Douglas, even

Their main problem in the next episode will probably be none other than our precious Emilyko. She's brainwashed, and Douglas just told her Doug isn't brainwashed. Besides, how is she able to remain cute even in her current form? (ch201 page 17) I guess that's Emilyko we're talking about it

Emilyko learnt alot and i mean ALOT as of now. She may be able to put up a fight against 3 of them while she's still brainwashed

Who could be another one of their allies? It seems even her debutant class is brainwashed. Perhaps, Ram and Shirley? She's still hiding so.. And i honestly have more faith in the newcomers than Kate's debutant class just as of now. After all, they have Candy. And Kate wasn't able to come in contact with her debutants as of now

Gilbert was given fragments of favor and i think same applies to Maryrose. So they're probably out of the picture.. HOWEVER, Maryrose!! As much as that makes me believe in her far less because of her affiliation with Anthony, her escaping the manor and not participating in events, atleast probably in relation to Anthony might be a sign she isn't fond of him as much as i thought

Besides, i'd say they were quite able to bond during their battle in master robe arc. I'm honestly leaning more to that she'll be on Kate's then Anthony's side

Oliver and Evelyn seem to be influenced by Christopher aswell. Idk if i talked about that, but someone, i think it could've been Gilbert, or perhaps Douglas?? Talked about how undoubting everyone else is of Kate. It's as if most of them go along with her just because they don't want to rebel against ones and power (and that they like her) rather than they actually understand why she's rebelling, what she's talking about and her intentions.

If Patrick, John, Oliver, Evelyn weren't pretending - if even THEY were brainwashed it's insane how easy it'll be to brainwash others. Perhaps though, not the newcomers. I feel like Candy did far too big of a job to be ignored - but still.. John and Patrick, being aware of so much, didn't even realise it's best to oppose Christopher? Dammit.. Ugh.. 

Also, Louise isn't out of the picture. I don't think she was even at the new teams announcement thing - although her team was announced. Benjamin, and Louise, Belles, and Barbara, was it not?? 

Louise probably being on her side is pretty cool, in a weird way. She went from being a weakness for Kate and others (Not as it was her fault. And i'm most definetely not saying she should've abandoned her - absolutely not. Just that her position disadvantaged the children and gave them alot of extra work to do) to probably an instant ally. 

So, let's summarize

Probable instant allies to Kate : 

Douglas/Doug (Already an ally)

Ram/Shirley (Didn't drink the coffee, and nor i think were they present)

Louise/Lou (Didn't drink the coffee, and nor i think were they present)

Stella/Candy + the 4 newcomer pairs (Candy's influence and doubt of others, and her being highly doubting of everyone, even Kate likely means she won't fall under Christopher's influence and will work on helping her newcomers aswell. She's most definetely able to figure out Kate wasn't sincere in accepting Anthony either)

Where to go next? 

Oliver/Ollie, Evelyn/Eve = Kate spent quite some time with them, especially Oliver. 

John/Shaun, Patrick/Ricky = They likely won't doubt her after helping her for such a long time

Douglas's team members = Douglas is already her ally and they trust him alot

Kate, instantly losing nearly everything does give her an underdog position. Christopher will probably battle it out with Grandfather and 3rd floor shadows while Kate will try to recover

However, Anthony already predicted her betrayal. That much from her behavior is quite certain imo. But when will he take action against her? Joseph's side probably won't let him, and maybe they can genuienly cooperate, although not in a good faith, atleast for some time

He probably won't underestimate her either. He knows alot about her and how smart she is. Even Kate couldn't figure out he's the hidden mastermind, afterall. 

The next episode will probably be Kate Douglas and Doug tryna unbrainwash Emi and after that probably talking about where to go next.  

Ima do 3-4 more chapters today. I'll see if i wanna go for the next one after reading 3 chapters

Chapter 202 : 9/10

Chapter 203 : 9.4/10

Chapter 204 : 9.5/10

(Ch202) No way, Thomas is alive??? He was much smarter than i thought, in that case. Something tells me he may want to ally himself with Kate, but eh, i'm not sure at all. 

Finished. I decided to end it here, i'd very much like to read another chapter but this feels like a good chapter to end the story on and besides that means i'll just read one more chapter tmr anyway

Thomas being.. silly? Is surely something i didn't expect.. That's pretty weird

As for Jeremy.. I honestly noticed something odd

First of all, the way to draw everyone's attention. He threw a fucking bottle at Candy? That's far too agressive for someone to try to start a conversation... I guess it worked tho because he prob wanted to have a private convo with Kate

But that's not THAT odd imo, what i really find odd is the following

So, if you think about it. Why would even Anthony mention that he killed Alfred in his convo with Kate in the first place??? What is the point of that?? 

Watching after Kate, he probably deduced she has morals. If she does, she'll be cautious in believing him. Why make it worse by revealing you're a murderer???

I mean, he most definetely predicted she'll be betraying him.. but like.. unless he was trying to convey to Kate that he understands she's going to be hostile to him - i don't see the reason to say that at all. 

Besides, that probably isn't the case because in the past he said Kate will beg to be his pupil. Although, Kate's reaction obviously conveyed hidden intentions, i guess it wouldn't be too bad if he figured that out on the spot

But either way, to the point, first Anthony mentions he murdered Alfred, then Jeremy conviniently claims to have seen him killing him. It's as if his whole goal of saying that was to make her aware of the story so that she trusts Jeremy a bit more when he's saying that. That way, he'll have a spy in Kate's faction

Jeremy's story and speaking was pretty sincere, and his motives seem pretty clear to me aswell. 

However, i think there's another side to this 

What if Jeremy is sincere, but Anthony predicted he's gonna try to pledge his loyalty to Kate, which is why he revealed he killed his father. To sew doubt between Jeremy and Kate?

According to Jeremy, it seems that he deceived Anthony by acting brainwashed when he was testing whether he's broken the brainwashing or not. But isn't it convinient he just.. appeared there in the first place? He probably didn't have plans  to enter the manor until he saw Anthony killing Alfred. 

Anthony probably got suspicious of that.. but idk if Jeremy has even shared everything with even the research team. This does seem like a bit too much of evidence to randomly reveal - and in that case - how could Anthony even realise that he both saw his murder, unbroke the brainwashing AND is gonna try to ally himself with Kate? That theory seems far too unlikely, but it's Anthony so i feel like it's possible

All 3 possibilities are very likely imo, but here's what i think as of now

45% : Anthony isn't aware of Jeremy + Jeremy is Sincere with Kate

40% : Anthony and Jeremy are working together. Jeremy is insincere with Kate and Anthony mentioned him killing Alfred for Kate to realise Jeremy's story isn't made up

15% : Jeremy is Sincere with Kate, but Anthony figured everything out and told Kate that in order to make her doubt Jeremy

Anyway, seems i was right about Louise/Lou and Ram/Shirley being allies. But it seems Candy didn't take care of her newcomer group yet, so i was wrong there. After all, she's the smartest one, the one with uhh immune stomach or wtv 

The whole thing was pretty peak too. Thomas acting all silly is pretty funny, too. And Emilyko's expressions during entire ch202 (But especially when she jumped on Douglas) were just far too precious 

That's it for today

Chapter 205 : 8.7/10  
Chapter 206 : 8.5/10  
Chapter 207 : 9.5/10  
Chapter 208 : 9.4/10

(ch205) LMAO EDWARD GOT FUCKED. L. His obsession with Kate prevented him from anticipating literally anything unrelated to her. That's what caused his ""Downfall"" anyway (Downfall is also the chapter's name lol)

Edward messed with Barbara? I suppose Joseph's just talking about him telling her Christopher's dead. But even then, that soot outbreak was a bit suspicious, even though it matched ""severe seizure""'s description

(ch207) Wow, alot of allies. Unfortunately though, it seems Evelyn wasn't convinced. Kidnapping her is quite crazy though... Anyway, let me compare this with my initial list of Kate's allies i made before. 

It seems i was correct about John, Patrick and Oliver. I was also already correct about Lou and Ram being her allies

Also correct about Candy, but only half correct about the 4 other newcomers. I was wrong about Evelyn, unless Kate manages to convince her next ep. I also couldn't anticipate the relief team, Thomas and Jeremiah/Jeremy being on her side

Okay, finished. Should've anticipated Evelyn wasn't actually going to still follow Anthony, given the events that happened earlier, but whatever.

Anyway, this was awesome. Kate still hasn't mentioned her opinion on to what extent does Anthony suspect them, but that's fine. 

I wonder if the mystery is solveable with our current information? Well.. For now, i'll assume it is, but i really wonder how much am i really going to tackle it. I'll try my best

First of all, i already mentioned it earlier, but i already thought Joseph is extremely weird. He's the only known person to betray the mirrors house and yet he's not even the governor. Who is this great grandfather? Is he a puppet? Is he the person Joseph actually worked for? Is he the creator of the morphs, the coffee, and maybe even the soot coal? 

I better not have missed something, but AFAIK we don't really know where the brainwashing coffee comes from do we? 

The fragments of favor, AFAIK, are only essential for when morphs imitate shadows and unify. But by giving them to others generally their soot power either blossoms, or increases in power. Higher dosage = more powers, higher chance of failure

Those may also be created by TGG (The great grandfather), then.   
  
But the brainwashing coffee. It's different from that, is it not? First of all, As far as i remember, Lewis's power helped brainwash others. He was doing that to louise. And OG Christopher's soot power was to help others build trust with him

But that is different from brainwashing, is it not? It's as if Lewis + possibly christopher v2 have opposite soot powers from the original christopher

So i guess the brainwashing coffee was just overwritten using Lewis's powers, which is all? 

Those thoughts may have been random, but may aswell explain them for now. After thinking of TGG's possible soot power, creating coffee isn't out of the way, especially because it's portrayed as ""TGG's coffee"" sometimes

That led me to think -> Is it possible Anthony knows something about the coffee's nature? And how he was able to overwrite it so that others follow Christopher? I tried to use Anthony's actions to confirm to what extent does he really lack information. Kate did mention he's trying to basically build an army an use force, so i guess it's true he may lack info, but is it really that simple? There are probably some things Anthony knows which Kate doesn't.

But i don't think i can grasp an opening yet. After all, what we know is that Lewis's soot powers were enough to replace TGG's brainwashing with Christopher's. That alone doesn't give us an opening in Anthony's thoughts because he most likely just rewrote it without knowing Coffee's original source and how it's made beforehand

But with that out of the way, what can we grasp about Joseph?

I don't think we've seen the other 3F shadows that much, nor we can grasp their intentions. AFAIK it was only at both debuts and both times Edward was called to TGG's room

Well, i think Joseph banishing Edward to coal mine aswell as letting Kate know he found her suitcase may have some sort of hint. 

I already talked about the latter, but what he did is so far is signal to Kate that he's aware of her suitcase, yet isn't actually going to do much about that as of now. And Edward being deported by ICE is probably his move towards keeping Kate in-play to pose some kind of opposition to Anthony. I initially assumed he'd be willing to cooperate with her, but that is most likely not the case. He probably just wants to keep her alive so that the childrens faction is divided onto those who follow Kate and Anthony.

Not even the 3rd floor shadows objected to Joseph chasing Edward out with evidence. And besides that, after Joseph told him go back TGG repeated the same thing. That may hint in connection between them, it's as if TGG repeated after him because Joseph is the real hidden mastermind. He sure does have influence

Well.. other than chasing out Edward and keeping Kate in play, i can't really read any hidden intentions. Maybe there's one more question though - Why coal mine?

I'm pretty sure that's the abandoned town because the normal coal wasn't needed because of the soot coal, and also where Jeremy, Dan and Lulu were from.

I can't really see him benefitting off the town prospering, though? It's not like he told Edward to investigate Lulu, Dan and more importantly Jeremy's past, no? 

But, it's not unlikely Edward will be able to find some evidence there. Perhaps, by coming in contact with whatever residents are there, if there are any they may lead to him figuring out Jeremy's past, but he probably doesn't even know about it. Maybe he'll find something of use he'll try to use as to prove he's ""useful""

However, a slightly more outside-the-box thought. What if collecting evidence is actually Edward's real mission in coal mine? What if Joseph knows Lewis is Anthony's pawn because of Edward's report that he switched out the corpse and that was all a spectacle to fool Lewis into believing Joseph isn't onto him yet? 

But then again.. Would evidence really matter this much to them??.. It comes off as slightly pointless unless Edward would be provided with an actual good lead to go off

But then why promote lewis? Not only is he on 2nd floor but also manages the children's building. + Edward's emotions seemed real and he didnt mention anything of that sort even in coal mine

However, if my theory is correct, atleast i don't think it contradicts Joseph's other actions regarding ignoring evidence about Kate but letting her know he's aware of her past

.. Well, besides Lewis's promotion. I don't really see the reason for that though

Though we're quite unsure of what knowledge Joseph has, too.. I think i can't quite progress too much as of now

1qgin2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oregontrail/comments/1qgin2a/beat_it_in_92_days/,Beat it in 92 days!,"I downloaded this on the switch on Wednesday of last week (Jan 14th). I finished on August 1st. I tried to push for July 31st, but no dice. Maybe on the harder difficulty. 

I’ve beaten most of the scenarios in that time, apart from the nature walk(?), and Lost Hollow (this one is rough). I’ve played just under 20 total hours according to the game. Two deaths, neither of which were from Dysentery or Cholera. 

I’m no expert on this game by any means, but I’ll lay out what I did to hopefully help others! 

Starting out, I try my best to get good characters. I prefer the doctor, mountain man/woman, carpenter, and farmer if I can get them. Make sure at least ONE CHARACTER has charming!!! This is the BIGGEST helper for all players. 

On this play through I had the doctor, carpenter, banker, and trapper. I get the second biggest 6x6 grid wagon. I purchase the guides and give them to whatever character I think has the best way finding. In this case, it’s the trapper. This makes the early portions easier, as you can harvest berries without issue, and find your oxen if they run off. 

Next, I only buy meat, a knife, bait, meds, tools if I didn’t get the carpenter, grease, coffee beans, ammo, trail map, and clothes. Depending on what I get from characters and from trading in independence, will dictate what I spend all my money on. I usually have less than $5 left on me when I leave. 

Once out of town, I use grease, set speed to max 16hr days, and full portions. I will generally use the trail map first thing to make sure I hit up the best spots. My ultimate goal is to get $700+ dollar before I hit the second town. This then allows me to upgrade to the largest wagon, giving me 12 more slots and an extra oxen. 

Fishing is the best money maker in the game, and it’s not even close. Hunting serves its purpose, as I solely eat meat in the game, and I need the pelts. So fish as often as you can, and throw out items if needed for more fish. If you speak to the missionaries and charm them (with charming personality character), you get $2 per pound of fish. I usually get $240 per stop before I hit the next town. Giving me plenty of money to buy the wagon and anything else I want or need. 

With trading, it took me a while to figure this out, but if you don’t like the stuff they have/want, you can back out of it to the main selection menu (talk, trade, rest, leave) and then go back and their items generally change. It’s not every time, but it helps. I’ve been able to get multiple coffee beans or grease from this method. 

Then, the rest is being smart, managing resources, hoarding stuff when needed, and playing through to the end. 

Biggest time waste was waiting for crossings. I took every ferry I could, since money wasn’t an issue. But when I needed to cross I would do so when it was 80%+ chance. 

I’m open to answer anything that may help people enjoy this game more ☺️ (also, if you have advice for lost hollow, I need help 😅)",1,1768766334.0,Oregontrail,0,1.0,False

My relapse started with drinking green tea, then more and stronger green tea, then black tea then coffee and you know the rest. After 3 months of being clean I drank caffeine for 2 weeks in amounts way smaller than before but I think my tolerance is back to zero because even tea and small coffee works very strongly on me now.

So what's the bottom line?

My anxiety is back again, my sleep is worse, I feel like I can't rest. I feel this ""full"" feeling in my brain that's the very well known wired but tired state.

Was the abstinence period all great?

No.

I was tired but I felt that when I was resting I was really resting.

Sleep was way deeper and I had more dreams. It was difficult to focus at work though.

Life without caffeine sucks.

But at this point in my life when Im extremely burnt out at work and in my personal life, life with caffeine is just not worth it. It's like taking scamy loans every day just to get by while already being crazely in debt.

1qgijgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/1qgijgn/please_destroy_my_draft_happy_mlk_day/,Please destroy my draft. Happy MLK day.,"My thesis here is a consideration of Structural Functionalism rather than conflict theory as the framework to engage with the forces of civilization. The premise is that structural functionalism is superior. My Thesis here is not primarily intended to present an ideological socio-political position but rather to recommend a reframing of the approach to the discussion, and a consideration of the limitations of the central terms we use in this discourse. The caveat here is that in pursuit of my own logic, by bias shows and its toward liberal democracy and against other certain economically puerile ideas. I don’t think it necessary to discus that rather than schools of social theory, but I realize that this sub is about the ideological collision so it’s likely the only response I will get. In any case, here it is: 

In my opinion the attempt to unify the contradictions of “capitalism” with conflict theory (Marx) was a failure. The implication of Godel’s Theorem to me, is that it can be hard to say things that are true with natural language and hard to say things that are meaningful with mathematical language.

When we see contradiction in natural language we should question how we are defining our terms. If we want to know “who shaves the barber” our language has to be incisive enough. My premise is that it currently is not in regards to the terms “capitalism” and “socialism” This is a thought exercise. It’s not tractable to redefine “capitalism” outside its colloquial definition.

If you consider a structural functionalist framework rather than conflict theory framework, you could make progress. You could say “force x” functions in all civilizations. You could say “force x” is meritocracy and equality of opportunity. The oppositional “force-y” would be humanism and equity. You can’t weigh merit and simultaneously reduce virtues to their humanist basis. You can’t provide equality of opportunity and produce equity. They are oppositional forces. When these forces are implemented through institutions of power, those institutions have to be able to justify their power.

We won’t sell the world on replacing “capitalism” definition for how I defined “force x”. Force x is only dissolved by opposing forces. It doesn’t cause its own dissolution in a vacuum. It’s not the only force at play. As mentioned, All will continue to see “capitalism” through its colloquial definition about class struggle in perpetuity ad-nauseam. 

A term like “Late stage capitalism” lives in the obscure side of conflict theory “capitalism” definition. Never will people agree that it’s a thing. Like all discourse around this contradictory term, when people say “capitalism” they are usually talking about something else. Usually it’s “will call it force Z” The consolidation of wealth and power (oppositional to democracy) when you say “late stage capitalism” you might mean finaincialization of economic activity that is growth dependent. You might be referencing to the pattern of rise and fall of Empirial power. You can see this reflected best in the aesthetics of low, middle, high periods in art and architecture history and theory. It’s a real thing, but its relationship to capitalism is perhaps indirect. One could argue otherwise I’ve seen it done, but not convincingly. History doesn’t repeat, it rhymes. 

If you frame things in terms of class conflict or the incidental collision of industrialization with Empirialism, you may miss the point of the dynamic of meritocracy and humanism, the dynamics of equity and equality. These are the problems we would try to solve, if we could find the language to do so. 

Rather than the goal be an ideological adherence to “capitalism” or “socialism” I think we would do better to make liberal democracy work. And by that I do not mean “neoliberal economic policy” which is neither new, nor liberal. However, we could make it more so. We can do this because we can use democracy to dismantle institutions that cannot justify their power. We can have strong enough institutions for common goals and shared purpose (aka ethics) to allow some maritime law, or we can have continental war. These institutions can only be strong and ethical if we operate a liberal democracy to produce them. That’s my conjecture anyway. 

“Socialism” doesn’t mean humanism and equity to many people, like the “force-y” When people use the term “socialism” , they are often coveting ideology. Ideology might look pretty, but history is bloody. Ideology is the black hole of intellectual thought space. Once in its orbit you cannot change your perspective. However, we will see in practice that institutions that promote say equity, must justify that power. In some scenarios it can be justified, in other cases it might not be and may cause negative selection of merit. 

And money. Getting rid of money to fix power dynamic. Is like saying you get rid of seratonin to fix a headache. Money is a regulatory pattern. Much like you can’t fix your economy by printing more money. It only looks good in the short term,… like concaine. It helps till you have inflation or burnout respectively. Thats why it doesn’t matter if you back it with gold or marbles. What matters is the regulatory pattern and its ability to lower the area under the curve (minimize cost).

And you talk about private property. That matters so far as the land is tied to the means of production. If it were ONLY so, I would think that would be disastrous. It may even be that if it is so, we draw toward a local maximum of feudalism. In a society where ideas are tied to the means of production, liberal democracy may be the local maximum. I suspect that to be the case

So hypothetically, if you took this idea of defining the forces of power in civilization , and do this in the service of building a Structural Functionalist framework. Take the idea of regulatory functions and separate them to model these systems. If we do this, and build a Functional Structuralist framework, what are the implications? We end up with a values based system. Structural Functionalist Theory meets its biggest opposition here. So I will steelman that argument. At the time it was developed, social mores were rather misogynistic compared to later. Values change. I’ll summarize what I think is the implication of this by saying; we mustn’t fall into the naturalistic phallacy or try to give up because we see values are relative. They aren’t relative if you pursue shared purpose, and that’s what ethics are by definition. We know that mores aren’t static as they deal with adaptation and progression. We can however, define the function of these values in a way that we can analyze mores better. That is the premise. The pitfall of relativism is the same here as it is when applied to any thoughts. It ranges from the uncontested obvious point to the intellectual castration and nihilism of the “relativist” position. It seems to me that being value based is actually a strength as well as a weakness. It seems like a sociopath-political system for ethics, probably should be values based. The tension between the traditional and the progressive must be addressed. The over-use of traditionalism being the naturalistic fallacy. Of course I’d expect there are other challenges that I’d like to hear. The arguments I hear are just various forms of not liking that it has a quality of tautology. 

So what’s an example of this? I think MLK gives us the best example of applying Stuctural Functionalism to socio-political analysis. Martin Luther King Jr. viewed institutional power not as an abstract entity, but as a system that required direct action. 

“You reach for a bar of soap, and that's given to you at the hands of a Frenchman. And then you go into the kitchen to drink your coffee for the morning, and that's poured into your cup by a South American. And maybe you want tea: that's poured into your cup by a Chinese.

Or maybe you're desirous of having cocoa for breakfast, and that's poured in your cup by a West African. And then you reach over for your toast, and that's given to you at the hands of an English-speaking farmer, not to mention the baker.

And before you finish eating breakfast in the morning, you've depended on more than half of the world. This is the way our universe is structured, it is its interrelated quality. We aren't going to have peace on earth until we recognize this basic fact of the interrelated structure of all reality...""

\\\~Martin Luther King, Jr.

Dec. 25, 1967

This speech is a good example, but I think the Structural Functionalist approach permeated all of Kings arguments and how he viewed institutional power. He fought for an ecumenical approach over a sectorial, but he applied rationalism in understanding how to engage institutional power and I think he was more productive in implementation of socio-political ethics than Marx. At least that’s my perspective. ",2,1768766098.0,sociology,1,1.0,False

1qgiit3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mint99/comments/1qgiit3/best_automatic_milk_frothers_2026/,Best automatic milk frothers 2026,"Hey everyone,

Quick update from our side. If you are not familiar with us, we are from Requiremints (operating also the Mint99 product research tool) and we spend our time digging through specs to save you the headache.

We recently reviewed 20+ options for automatic milk frothers in different price ranges.

Here are a few things to consider before you buy:

* **Cleaning style**: Removable jugs that go in the dishwasher are much easier to live with than units where the electronics are attached to the cup.
* **Foam type**: Some machines just make bubbles, while others make microfoam (wet paint texture) which is better for latte art.
* **Temperature control**: Cheaper units usually just have ""hot"" or ""cold,"" while nicer ones let you dial in the heat.
* **Capacity**: If you are making drinks for two people or hot chocolate for kids, standard frothers might be too small.

# The Heavy Hitters (Premium & Versatile)

* **\[Best Overall Pick\] Breville BMF600XL** \- This is a workhorse with a stainless steel jug you can toss in the dishwasher. It uses induction heating and comes with separate discs for different foam textures.
* **\[Reliable Premium Choice\] Nespresso Aeroccino4** \- A solid upgrade from the older models that handles hot foam, cold foam, and warm milk. It is dishwasher safe and handles non-dairy milk better than most basic frothers.
* **\[Best Tech Value\] Dreo Milk Frother** \- Surprisingly advanced for the price, creating very fine microfoam perfect for latte art. It gives you precise control over speed and temperature rather than just a single on-button.

# Large Capacity & Family Friendly

* **\[Best For Families\] Secura F280R** \- This thing is huge compared to others, holding 500ml for hot chocolate or heating milk. The jug is removable for washing, which is a massive plus over sealed units.
* **\[Fast Heating Pick\] MUMAO 4-in-1** \- Heats up milk in about three minutes with a decent 350ml capacity. It has a detachable base which makes pouring easier, and it automatically shuts off for safety.

# Simple & Compact

* **\[Best Everyday Value\] Instant Pot Milk Frother** \- A straightforward option if you already trust the brand. It has four modes including cold foam, works fast, and the lid and whisks are dishwasher safe for easy cleanup.
* **\[Simple Compact Choice\] Nespresso Aeroccino3** \- The classic simple option that does one thing well without taking up counter space. It is strictly for people who just want hot or cold froth with one button press.
* **\[Basic Entry Level\] Keurig Milk Frother** \- If you have limited space and just want foam for a morning coffee, this works. It is not fancy, but it is small, easy to use, and gets the job done.
* **\[Budget Friendly Option\] Simpletaste Milk Frother** \- A no-frills tool that heats and froths without costing much. It is small and quiet, but the non-stick interior means you have to be careful when cleaning it by hand.

Hopefully this helps narrow it down for you.

If you want more info or to use filters to see other brands, different types or budget ranges they should check the full research on [our research page of automatic milk frothers](https://requiremints.com/guide/best-automatic-milk-frothers/).

**Presentation (First Look!)**

For the price, the presentation is crazy. The box feels way nicer than it should, and the bottle gives me old-school brandy glass vibes. Super display-worthy. It's funny, I feel like I'm holding an old glass from the '60s!



**Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa wear test (First Sniff! )**

From the first sniff, this one definitely gives me a sweet, cozy, and holiday-ready gourmand. I get some coffee, vanilla, cinnamon, and this praline-like sweetness that makes me keep sniffing my wrist. Then, as I continue to smell more, I get a warm, spicy, and honestly kind of addictive smell. It feels built for cool weather, and I can see it really flourishing during the fall/winter, especially around the holidays. Great for holiday gatherings, nights out, and date night when you want something cozy but still noticeable. If you don’t like sweet gourmands, this is not the “safe” blind buy.



**Listed notes**

**Top:** Cinnamon, Cardamom, Ginger

**Heart:** Praline, Candied Fruits, White Flowers

**Base:** Vanilla, Coffee, Tonka Bean, Benzoin, Musk



**Performance (on me)**

I’m getting around 12 hours on skin and on clothes (Jacket a couple of days!). Maybe a little of. Projection is strong, about a 2 ft bubble for 3+ hours before it starts calming down. Sillage is strong, people definitely notice while I walk by.



**Pros**

The coffee + vanilla + cinnamon combo is pretty addictive and instantly gives cozy holiday vibes. Performance is legit for the price.



**Cons**

I don't have any dislikes or cons about this fragrance!



**When I’d wear it**

Fall/winter for sure, and cold nights in early spring. I’d avoid heat unless you go super light. I could see myself reaching for this for a date night, night out, or holiday gathering!



**Overall**

For under $30, this feels like a steal! This could become a unisex fragrance to me. If you like sweet, cozy gourmands and want something for holidays, date nights, or going out at night, it’s an easy recommendation.

Some friends are traveling to Europe this summer and invited my daughter and me to join their family. My daughter is an only child, and this would be a good opportunity for her to have a couple of buddies while we travel. Now that she's a teenager (13), adults -esp. her parents, lol - are boring to her. 

  
Their travels include a week-long DCL cruise starting in Rome and visiting the Greek Isles. I am \*not\* a cruise person. Did it once in college and said never again. I don't like having so many people in such close quarters, and the particular cruise I went on attracted the lowest common denominators. However, I imagine a family oriented Disney cruise would attract less of a party crowd. 

  
Cons:

Tight spaces; I know cruise ship rooms are so small. 

 Greek isles will be really hot, and daughter is sensitive to heat; it's \*very\* expensive. I thought cruises were cheaper than this - it appears that even coffee and tea are extra?!?!? What about coffee in the morning? 

  
I also have anxiety over how big the ship is, how easy it is to get lost, and how easy it is to get sick with so many people in close quarters. 

Pros:

The tween and teen clubs look promising, and she could chill there for a couple of days if she doesn't want to sightsee. 

It looks like they alternate sightseeing and sailing days, which would give my daughter some downtime. 

I'd love feedback on the shows, which sound like fun. How is the food? It looks like they have buffets and fine-dining restaurants—both are included, and I assume you have to reserve the restaurants?

Would love any feedback!

1qgi71y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qgi71y,Majestic Mirage Review Costa Mujeres,"TLDR: Beautiful resort and rooms, average to good food, very nice beach. HOWEVER it just opened and there are a lot of small annoying issues. I’d recommend either waiting 4-6 months or making sure you get a discounted price and are ok with a new resort figuring it out. 7.5 as is 8.5 once issues resolved.

Rooms:

The rooms are a 9/10 all of them are spacious and have 2 bathrooms. We had the swim up room, the only downside is the pool was very cold and most swim up rooms don’t have a private pool. Showers are nice, we had to move rooms because the first one given to us had issues with the doors closing and was just rushed overall to get completed the second room in building 2 was great.

Food:

The food I would give a 7/10 some food was just plain or average (Italian), other areas like the seaside grill (outside of snack hour) and the Japanese were great. The coffee shop on the resort was amazing definitely try the Mexican coffee, raspberry dessert, and caramel ice cream. The steakhouse was also very good, and there is a lot of choice as we also went to the Indian, French, and Mexican restaurants. The French is most popular. At seaside I liked being able to select cuts of meat and skewers to have cooked infront of you for lunch. The breakfast buffet called marketplace was also really good, the only downside was I didn’t like their eggs. The meat was great and they even have someone making you smoothies at the smoothie bar.

Drinks:

7.5/10 lots of premium alcohol, not always consistent when making the same drink.

Beach:

The beach is an 8/10 lots of quality cabanas, soft white sand. The seaweed is out of their control, they keep it minimal but it’s still annoying.

Service:

7/10 for the service everyone is very nice and accommodating. However I find that they take a while to fulfill requests. This was a constant theme from check in to really any request made. You get a butler here and that was super convenient to just text for anything I needed or to ask questions.

Conclusion:

Overall I’d give the majestic mirage costs mujeres a 7.5 out of 10 in its current state, when they figure out all the small issues after opening I can easily see this going up to an 8.5

We had a great time here relaxing and really enjoyed the large room, food options, and relaxing at the beach.

I took all the photos with these new glasses I’m trying, sorry if they are a bit slanted. If you want to know anything else about the resort, please ask below and I’ll be happy to answer. This is my first time doing a review so I hope it was helpful.

Here are some of the small annoying things that we experienced: night time lights not timed right about 30-45min it was very dark on the resort one night, some of the rooms have shower draining issues, bathroom doors too low to the ground and scrape against the floor, balcony doors not locking properly, service being slow at times.

Kelly groaned, reaching blindly for hers on the desk. Titus rolled to his side, grabbing his.

The message was from Edward:

I’ll be in the gym at 0530 for workout. Don’t be late. – E

Titus read it aloud. “Edward says he’ll be in the gym at 0530.”

Kelly lifted her head from his chest, hair mussed, eyes sleepy. “Was that Edward?”

“Yeah,” Titus said, setting the pad down. “He wants me to meet him for workout.”

Kelly snuggled closer, head resting on his chest again. “This is nice,” she murmured, fingers tracing lazy circles over his heart. “Just us. Quiet.”

He kissed the top of her head. “Yeah. It is.”

They lay like that—bodies cooling, hearts slowing—until sleep took them both.

At 0500 the soft chime of morning cycle began. Lights brightened gradually from deep amber to pale blue-white.

Titus woke first.

Kelly’s eyes were already open, watching him. She smiled—small, soft, full of warmth.

“Can we do this again?” she whispered.

He laughed quietly, brushing hair from her face. “Every day. But Edward wants me in the gym in thirty minutes.”

Kelly pouted playfully. “Go back to sleep for a bit. I need to get back to my quarters and shower. You go work out. I’ll meet you in the mess hall at 0700. Cathy worked a half shift last night—she messaged me around 0100. She’ll be there.”

Titus kissed her—slow, lingering. “Sounds good.”

He slipped out of bed, padding to the tiny shower stall. Kelly watched him go, biting her lip.

He turned on the water—cold at first, shocking him awake—then warmer. Soap suds slid down his back.

Kelly appeared in the doorway, still naked, leaning against the frame. “Hm. I just needed another look.”

She stepped in, pressed herself against him under the spray, kissed him hard—wet, hungry—then pulled back with a grin.

“Quick kiss. Bye.”

She slipped out, grabbed her clothes, dressed in seconds, and left.

Titus finished showering, dressed—fresh coveralls over the purple-and-gold shirt—grabbed his data pad, and headed out.

He typed a quick message to his mom while walking:

Hey mom just got your message. Kelly Raven you say. I may know her dad. I had one with that last name working here some time back. I’m so glad the date went well son. Send me a picture of her if it gets more serious. Be careful. Oh Edward Russell knows animal. Tell Mr Russell animal said he never paid that 20 credits on the bet. Would not say the bet. Love mom

He hit send, pocketed the pad, and headed to the gym.

Checking in at the entrance—chit beeped green—he stepped inside. Edward was already on a resistance machine, pushing through reps with steady focus.

Titus chose the treadmill next to him.

Edward glanced over, smiling faintly. “Morning, young man.”

“Morning,” Titus replied, starting at a slow jog.

They worked in comfortable silence for a while—treadmills humming, weights clanking in the background.

Edward finally spoke. “She’s a good girl, Titus. Don’t break her heart.”

Titus nodded, breathing steady. “My mom would say the same thing to her.”

Edward chuckled. “Smart woman, your mom.”

They continued the workout—burning through the hour with simple conversation: flight tips, station gossip, the best way to handle micro-gravity docking. Nothing heavy. Just two pilots sharing space.

When the hour ended, Edward wiped his face with a towel. “I’m hitting the shower. See you—most likely with Kelly and Cathy—in a little bit.”

Titus nodded. “See you.”

He headed back to his quarters, walking a little slower. The station felt different now—less foreign, more like home.

He palmed his door open.

Better take another shower, he thought, sniffing the air. What’s that smell? Oh…

He picked up the scattered clothes from the night before, threw them in the marked laundry bag, set it by the door.

Looking around: I need more clothes. And sheets. Note to self—get sheets on before leaving.

He showered quickly, dressed—fresh coveralls—brushed his teeth, ran a hand through his hair. Nope, don’t need to shave yet.

Grabbed the laundry bag, headed out, dropped it in a hamper along the way. Thinking: Clothes smelled pretty bad. Should’ve thrown the sheets in too.

Entering the mess hall, he grabbed a food tray—eggs-and-bacon sandwich, coffee, water—scanned the chit.

He spotted Kelly at a table, holding a bottle of water. He grabbed two more.

Well, he beat Edward. Interesting.

Sliding in next to Cathy, Kelly said, “Excuse me.”

Everyone laughed.

Hopping up, she went around the table. Sitting down beside Titus, she gave him a quick peck on the cheek.

Cathy grinned. “Well, Titus, sleep good?”

Kelly leaned in to Cathy, whispering something that made Cathy’s eyes widen.

Before Titus could answer, Cathy said, “Never mind.”

Edward arrived, sitting next to Cathy, looking at Titus. “Young man, less than a week ago both these women would sit with me.” He motioned to each side.

Kelly rolled her eyes. “Uncle, please.”

Titus asked, “No Director Hale this morning?”

The girls all smiled.

Cathy said, “Guess you don’t know. Joana and Hale are… let’s say good friends. Until last night she was mad at him.”

Titus blinked. “Oh. Well… let’s eat while we talk. We have less than an hour until operational briefing.”

Little small talk flowed—light, easy—while they ate.

At 0745 Edward’s data pad pinged. Then Cathy’s. Then Kelly’s.

Edward read it. “Changed to 0900. From Hale.”

Kelly and Cathy looked at their pads. They exchanged a glance, smiling.

Kelly said, “Uncle, we just received a message from Joana saying it could be later than 0900. A problem has arisen.”

Edward hmmed. “I wonder what that could be.”

Even Titus started laughing.

Ping.

Everyone looked at Titus.

“What’s yours say?” Kelly asked.

Titus read aloud:

Hi T just got your message. Kelly Raven you say. I may know her dad. I had one with that last name working here some time back. I’m so glad the date went well son. Send me a picture of her if it gets more serious. Be careful. Oh Edward Russell knows animal. Tell Mr Russell animal said he never paid that 20 credits on the bet. Would not say the bet. Love mom

Titus laid the pad on the table.

Kelly blinked. “Is there something wrong?”

Titus shook his head slowly. “I messaged my mom on my way to my quarters… and received a reply back.”

Cathy frowned. “How’s that possible? With the distance… it should not be possible.”

Edward picked up his data pad, eyes narrowing. He typed quickly, sent a message to Hale:

………………………………………………………………..

Hey Spike what goes with Titus. He sent a message home a hour or so ago. And has a reply from his mom already. We need to talk. Someone has a QEC. – E

He set the pad down.

The table went quiet.

Kelly looked at Titus. “QEC?”

Edward exhaled. “Quantum Entangled Communicator. Instant comms. No delay. Rare. Expensive. Restricted.”

Titus stared at the pad. “My mom… has one?”

Edward met his eyes. “Looks like it.”

The station kept turning.

But right then, at that scarred table, something bigger than a late run began to unfold.

And none of them knew just how deep it went.

it's kidlin’s law. the rule says that if you can write a problem down clearly, the matter is already half-solved. most of us are prompting ""blind"" by asking for solutions before we’ve even defined the rot at the center of the issue.

i stopped asking ""how do i do this?"" and started using the ""logical leak"" method. it turns the ai into a cold-blooded strategist that finds the one mistake you’re too close to see.

here is the difference between a standard ""help me"" prompt and a high-level strategic audit.

**the unoptimized version:** 

>give me a business plan for a new coffee shop that will beat the local competition.

 the ai gives you the same generic advice about ""community"" and ""loyalty cards"" that everyone else already has. it's just predicting the most boring, safe path forward.

**the kidlin-anchored version:** 

>here is my current strategy for a coffee shop. find the hidden assumption in my logic that is most likely to cause a total failure in year one. tell me why i am wrong before you offer any improvements.

this forces the model to act as a mirror rather than a ghostwriter. it strips away the ego and the industry fluff to reveal the ""leak"" in your thinking. you aren't just getting an answer; you're getting a reality check that survived a logic test.

it feels less like a chat and more like having robert greene or a high-stakes consultant reviewing your notes. the ai is statistically better at finding the ""loss"" than you are because it doesn't care about your feelings.

once the leak is identified, the solution becomes obvious and the prompt practically writes itself. stop seeking the ""win"" and start asking the ai to find where you're already losing.

has anyone else tried prompting for the ""failure point"" instead of the ""success path""? it’s a total game-changer for big decisions.",1,1768765185.0,AIToolsPromptWorkflow,0,1.0,False

**Presentation (First Look!)**

For the price, the presentation is crazy. The box feels way nicer than it should, and the bottle gives me old-school brandy glass vibes. Super display-worthy. It's funny, I feel like I'm holding an old glass from the '60s!



**Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa wear test (First Sniff! )**

From the first sniff, this one definitely gives me a sweet, cozy, and holiday-ready gourmand. I get some coffee, vanilla, cinnamon, and this praline-like sweetness that makes me keep sniffing my wrist. Then, as I continue to smell more, I get a warm, spicy, and honestly kind of addictive smell. It feels built for cool weather, and I can see it really flourishing during the fall/winter, especially around the holidays. Great for holiday gatherings, nights out, and date night when you want something cozy but still noticeable. If you don’t like sweet gourmands, this is not the “safe” blind buy.



**Listed notes**

**Top:** Cinnamon, Cardamom, Ginger

**Heart:** Praline, Candied Fruits, White Flowers

**Base:** Vanilla, Coffee, Tonka Bean, Benzoin, Musk



**Performance (on me)**

I’m getting around 12 hours on skin and on clothes (Jacket a couple of days!). Maybe a little of. Projection is strong, about a 2 ft bubble for 3+ hours before it starts calming down. Sillage is strong, people definitely notice while I walk by.



**Pros**

The coffee + vanilla + cinnamon combo is pretty addictive and instantly gives cozy holiday vibes. Performance is legit for the price.



**Cons**

I don't have any dislikes or cons about this fragrance!



**When I’d wear it**

Fall/winter for sure, and cold nights in early spring. I’d avoid heat unless you go super light. I could see myself reaching for this for a date night, night out, or holiday gathering!



**Overall**

For under $30, this feels like a steal! This could become a unisex fragrance to me. If you like sweet, cozy gourmands and want something for holidays, date nights, or going out at night, it’s an easy recommendation.



**Rating: 5/5**



**I also heard this is a clone of Angel's Share by Kilians. I personally have not tried that fragrance, but is it close to the comparison or far off? Please share your opinion.**",1,1768765112.0,nisbahAU,0,1.0,False

The café was busy, so there was a queue. It wasn’t the kind of place where a waiter comes to your table—you have to stand in line and order yourself.

While I was waiting, I was texting someone on my phone. In front of me, there was a white European girl and her boyfriend—I think he was Arab. At some point, he stepped in front of me i didn’t really mind; honestly, I didn’t care.

While I was texting, I sometimes looked away from my phone, and I noticed that he was watching me closely, as if he was checking whether I was doing something.

Later, I briefly looked at the girl, and she spoke to him  in English. It was clear that English wasn’t her first language, and it sounded like she was asking about paying

it's kidlin’s law. the rule says that if you can write a problem down clearly, the matter is already half-solved. most of us are prompting ""blind"" by asking for solutions before we’ve even defined the rot at the center of the issue.

i stopped asking ""how do i do this?"" and started using the ""logical leak"" method. it turns the ai into a cold-blooded strategist that finds the one mistake you’re too close to see.

here is the difference between a standard ""help me"" prompt and a high-level strategic audit.

**the unoptimized version:** 

>give me a business plan for a new coffee shop that will beat the local competition.

the ai gives you the same generic advice about ""community"" and ""loyalty cards"" that everyone else already has. it's just predicting the most boring, safe path forward.

**the kidlin-anchored version:** 

>here is my current strategy for a coffee shop. find the hidden assumption in my logic that is most likely to cause a total failure in year one. tell me why i am wrong before you offer any improvements.

this forces the model to act as a mirror rather than a ghostwriter. it strips away the ego and the industry fluff to reveal the ""leak"" in your thinking. you aren't just getting an answer; you're getting a reality check that survived a logic test.

it feels less like a chat and more like having robert greene or a high-stakes consultant reviewing your notes. the ai is statistically better at finding the ""loss"" than you are because it doesn't care about your feelings.

once the leak is identified, the solution becomes obvious and the prompt practically writes itself. stop seeking the ""win"" and start asking the ai to find where you're already losing.

has anyone else tried prompting for the ""failure point"" instead of the ""success path""? it’s a total game-changer for big decisions.",1,1768765081.0,PromptCentral,0,0.67,False

1qgi2zu,https://i.redd.it/qp6e3ai2u5eg1.png,I've earned over $20K in a year whilst studying,"Hey everyone! Just wanted to share my experience working with Data Annotation Tech (DA) since I’ve noticed more people are curious about legit WFH options. I’ve been using the platform for about a year and a half now, and it’s helped me make over $20,000 whilst finishing up my degree here in the UK.

DA is similar to other data labelling platforms since you evaluate AI models, write prompts, give feedback, and work on a bunch of different projects. Some are creative, some technical, and some just need your honest opinion. I’ve worked on projects related to bilingual content, finance, business, safety, accuracy, and even a few STEM ones. Some require experience, but many are accessible even if you don’t have a formal background in the topic.

The best part about this job has been working from home or wherever I’ve got WiFi and coffee. The platform has become my main income source since graduating, and I’m now at full-time earnings with some other stuff on the side, completely remote. Payouts take about a week to verify, but you can withdraw every three days. Work volume can vary, but if you’re consistent and qualify for different project types, there’s real potential here. You do sign an NDA, so I can’t go into detail on the specific companies I’ve worked with, but they’re the biggest companies, especially in the AI field. Like any freelance or remote gig, there can be dry spells. However, this is the best remote platform I have worked for, and I have consistently been able to work. Whether a student, a recent grad, or just looking for more flexibility, this has been a game-changer for me.

I’ve also set up a Discord community (5K+ members) for anyone who wants to get into remote work, learn how to qualify for projects, share progress, and stay motivated. Whether you're new to this or turning side gigs into a full-time income, it's a space to connect, co-work, and grow together.

1qgi2lw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1qgi2lw/aio_i_broke_up_with_my_friend_of_15_years/,AIO: I broke up with my friend of 15 years,"This post is mostly cathartic for me. Other than the people directly involved I haven't gotten to tell anyone. I'm not doing a TL; DR because I feel like the story needs backstory. If you want a long read and several paragraphs of backstory, here it is:

Me (27 F) and my best friend (28 F) had been friends for 15 years. She was at my wedding and her daughter was my flower girl. She, her partner, and I all went to the same schools growing up. We will refer to her from here on out as BFF

Growing up, she had everything monitary. I grew up with an empty fridge. But, my BFF never looked down on me. She and her mom let me work at one of their restaurants and I got to earn some money from that. I was a terrible waitress but despite her dad not wanting me to work there, they advocated for me. 
Once we got to our last year of highschool, cracks started to show. BFF would say she was at my house when she was with a boyfriend or at a party. Her mom would call my mom panicked because she couldn't find her. I would cover for her at first, but eventually I felt bad for her mom and would tell her she wasn't with me. 

At the very climax of these issues, she got in a drunk driving accident and completely totaled the car and had some minor injuries. She didn't break any bones or have anything requiring surgical thank God, but I remember us crying in each other's arms when she got back from the hospital. I didn't know what I would do if I lost her. 

There were so many underlying dynamics of this relationship that I haven't even processed yet, but I guess the best way I could describe our relationship was that we both got jealous if we had other friends. If I hung out with others, she would get jealous. If she was out partying, I secretly resented it because I wanted to be invited too. I wanted to be important to her. 

I didn't tell her at first that I had applied to a college across the state. I didn't have any money, but I had a family member who would take me in and I could work my way through. Once I did tell her, she was really sad I was leaving her. I told her she could come, but she wanted to stay local and continue working at the restaurant. I think part of me wanted to do it on my own anyway, and ten years later I can admit that I didn't want her to come. 

I left and a year later I came back to visit for her baby shower when she was pregnant with her daughter. The dynamic of our relationship was so different. I was for the first time feeling like an individual outside of the relationship and the small town. And she hadn't changed, in her goodness towards me and her social life. She did seem to calm down with the baby on the way, and it seemed like baby daddy was very involved, and was known to be a good guy. 

A few years into their relationship and the new baby, they decided to move to the same town I lived in. At that point I graduated with my bachelor's (so this is 4 years after I left initially, we are 22 and 23) and she has a 3 year old. She is a great mom and her baby daddy is very involved. 
I got my teaching degree and am in my own place. I finally have health insurance, can pay my own way, and am starting to feel stable. I even met a guy that I was interested in, who eventually becomes my husband later on. 

She asked me for help in this move. Her parents have cut her off and are no longer helping financially, due to conflicts I didn't know about at the time. I helped her unpack the u-haul, I got her a job at the school I had been previously working in, and I contributed with free babysitting whenever they were both working and needed care. She had given me so much, and I was very excited to finally have something to give back. 

We continue like this until recently, so 4 more years. We aren't as close, but whenever she needed babysitting she called on me. We would meet for coffee about 2 or 3 times a year, otherwise when she dropped her daughter off, I would see her and we would chat. My husband and I got married a year ago (so in the timeline, I was 25 when I got married) and we would pay BFFs baby daddy to do odd jobs around the house to help them financially. 

Every time we would meet, she would share what struggles were going on. I noticed even beforehand because sometimes when she would drop her daughter off at my house, baby daddy didn't know where she was going off to. Or baby daddy would ask me to babysit and say ""it's a surprise for BFF, don't tell her, I want to take her out."" I would find out after that they were seeing other people, which wasn't necessarily anything bad, they agreed to it and were making sure they wouldn't involve their daughter in drama. 

I didn't think anything of it, I'm a homebody and I'm already home, and I think of their daughter as family, so it was never an imposition for me to have her. 

More recently, I had gotten calls from the daughter's school that she hadn't been picked up. I would call both parents and it always came out to a miscommunication between the two. 

The final event was a few weeks ago. I got a call right before bed from the baby daddy that my BFF had walked out on them and he was stuck at work. Daughter was at home alone. Keep in mind the timeline, shes only 8. 
My husband and I drove over, as I didn't want to go alone anymore. I had a scared feeling in my gut that something wasn't right. I had a spare key and went inside. The little girl was indeed by herself, and my BFF was nowhere to be found. Suddenly I realized this whole time when she was pretending they were taking care of their daughter, that they were being responsible parents, all was a lie. The state of the apartment and the little girl not knowing where her parents were, supremely pissed me off. Also, then the involvement of my husband and I, when there was clearly something wrong and we should not be involved in this drama, was worrying me. 

I waited there and my BFF showed up an hour later. Keep in mind, the daughter was alone before I got there too. She rolled her eyes and said ""Baby Daddy told me he called you. I told him I was coming back, I don't know why he didn't believe me."" 
He had told me already on the phone that she had gone overnight before and he was worried she wasn't coming back, as this wasn't the first time she disappeared to party. 

I had already decided I wasn't getting involved beforehand and would just leave when one of the parents showed up, as Baby Daddy had told me he didn't want me to tell BFF he had told me where she was and what she was doing.

But when she reacted like she hadn't done anything wrong and the worry and stress she had put myself, my husband, and her daughter through was just no big deal, I lost it. I sent her daughter to her room so we could talk. I told her how disappointing this all was, and how she made the conscious decision to leave her daughter alone to go wherever. When it would have been easy to just call me ahead of time. It's not like I had ever said no. And I told her to grow up. Her baby daddy shows up in the middle of all this and I told him the same thing. To grow up for their daughter. And finally, I said next time I find out they're doing this, I will show up for their daughter with the cops as well. And I left, leaving my spare key with them. 

They haven't spoken to me since. I have an incredible desire to reach out and ask if everyone is ok and how their daughter is doing, but my husband wants me to cut them off. He is still upset and triggered by the events. 

Did I overreact? Was it that serious? Am I the crazy one for chastising them?

I feel like that my problem with recruiting is that most of this stuff I worked on just lives on my laptop.

Even in coffee chats I’ll explain what I’ve worked on, but it always feels abstract because I’m just describing things instead of showing them.

I spent a couple weeks putting all my work into a simple personal website to toss every equity research report, valuation deck, and case I’ve ever worked on with a short description.

I wanted to make this post just to ask folks who’ve recruited successfully or who sit on the hiring side if you guys would actually see something like this as a positive, or does it just come across as extra? If you want to give some feedback the site is [imivani.com](http://imivani.com). I was thinking of just sticking it in the corner of my resume.

I checked the rules and hope it doesn't come across as self promotion, just literally asking if it's a good idea or not to have a personal portfolio website.

**Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa wear test (First Sniff! )**

From the first sniff, this one definitely gives me a sweet, cozy, and holiday-ready gourmand. I get some coffee, vanilla, cinnamon, and this praline-like sweetness that makes me keep sniffing my wrist. Then, as I continue to smell more, I get a warm, spicy, and honestly kind of addictive smell. It feels built for cool weather, and I can see it really flourishing during the fall/winter, especially around the holidays. Great for holiday gatherings, nights out, and date night when you want something cozy but still noticeable. If you don’t like sweet gourmands, this is not the “safe” blind buy.



**Listed notes**

**Top:** Cinnamon, Cardamom, Ginger

**Heart:** Praline, Candied Fruits, White Flowers

**Base:** Vanilla, Coffee, Tonka Bean, Benzoin, Musk



**Performance (on me)**

I’m getting around 12 hours on skin and on clothes (Jacket a couple of days!). Maybe a little of. Projection is strong, about a 2 ft bubble for 3+ hours before it starts calming down. Sillage is strong, people definitely notice while I walk by.



**Pros**

The coffee + vanilla + cinnamon combo is pretty addictive and instantly gives cozy holiday vibes. Performance is legit for the price.



**Cons**

I don't have any dislikes or cons about this fragrance!



**When I’d wear it**

Fall/winter for sure, and cold nights in early spring. I’d avoid heat unless you go super light. I could see myself reaching for this for a date night, night out, or holiday gathering!



**Overall**

For under $30, this feels like a steal! This could become a unisex fragrance to me. If you like sweet, cozy gourmands and want something for holidays, date nights, or going out at night, it’s an easy recommendation.

Most of the posters I've read are under 40 and mostly even in their teens and 20s so thought I'd add a middle aged perspective.

I'm in my late 40s as noted, no kids and have been single for about 15 years (I've had two LTR in my younger days)

Currently working a job I don't quite hate but quite dislike and making about $45 K a year.
I've achieved three university degrees but was never able to land a job with any of them (the last one was done over 10 years ago)

Financially I have around $35K in debt (mostly CC and some student loan) although thankfully I have about three times that amount in 'reitrement' savings, although I have to dig into it more and more for monthly expenses.

I have parents whom I'm close to in my city and go over once a week for dinner, to do laundry and stay over night on one of my days off (although I believe my father's at times fairly harsh parenting style and personality was part of my lifelong struggles with self esteem and confidence)
They are fairly well off financially and do assist me monthly.

I have very good rent on a one bedroom apartment I've lived in for almost 20 years but am facing possible eviction due to damage I've done by admittedly not taking care properly of the carpets and kitchen over the years.

So despite being in a somewhat mild hypomanic state last summer due to positive lifestyle changes to my health (following a months long depressive state), I reverted back into quite a depressive state in mid October as let go of some of my health (including over eating although I've now stopped previous near daily THC use) and have been trying to get back on track.

I have very few hobbies or interests, and have mostly lost interest in them due to ahendonia (used to be following news and politics, watching TV shows on the paranormal and unxplained and going for walks, although I still get about 8000 steps a day in my workday and on breaks).

I have a handful of friends from high school whom I  keep in sporadic touch with, and one friend in town whom I used to meet weekly for dinner or coffee and now meet maybe once a month as he's now married again and taking care of aged parents.

I did start Lexapro back about 6 weeks ago (and have yet to feel any effects) on the advice of my family doctor, whom I'm currently seeing about once a month for  uncontrolled high blood pressure, despite being on two medications.

Life just feels now like I'm dragging myself through each day and I admittedly spend most of my afternoons and evenings, including days off, lying in bed (and sleeping a bit at times, as I've been struggling with insomnia and daytime fatigue from getting on average 4 hours of sleep a night).

I feel like I have no direction in life except repeating the same depressing and dull week over and over again.

I'm was feeling suicidal in late November/early December, including trying out the possibility of suspension hanging with bedsheets off my shower rod and closet rod, and considering intentional car crashing as an ex co worker 'successfully' did into a tree or drowning in a lake I live a few blocks from (and I'm well aware all these methods could be unsuccessful and/or very painful at least temporarily)

 Unfortunately the feelings have returned in the last few days, although I seriously doubt if I'd actually go through with it due to the possibility of an unccessful attempt and being in a worse state, the effects on my family and friends, the possibility of extreme pain even with a 'successfull' attempt, and the fact I could feel better eventually.

 I know reading this it may sound like I actually have quite a bit to be thankful for but I'm just truthfully posting my perspective and am curious of others in their 40s (or younger) are in similar positions.",2,1768764786.0,SuicideWatch,3,1.0,False

Had some delicious coffee this morning at Komakase in San Francisco. My favorite was the Carmen because you can taste the delicate jasmine and florals up front and then later through the sip I got the tangerine and a little blackberry.

Sudan Rume was also pleasantly surprising, in that I didn’t get the strong bold herbal at the end of the sip that I tend to with Sudan Rubes.

Finishing with the mosto was a great recommendation by the barista due to how bold the mosto came through. As it cools you get more of the kiwi and watermelon.

Thank you to Datura for fantastic roasts and Komakase for excellent execution!

1qghxrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1qghxrm/budget_breville_bambino_setup_updated/,Budget Breville Bambino Setup (Updated),"So I recently had posted the below post with the idea that the setup could be done at a budget and achieve very good shots on a consistent basis. As a follow up to this, I wanted to include recent quality of life upgrades I made to the setup and why. Upgrades at the bottom! 

Budget Accessory Recommendations for Bambino Plus Users

For fellow bambino plus users like myself, I wanted to throw out what I use on a daily basis to make quality drinks at not so exorbitant costs. Many accessories or setups that get tossed around here tend to be on the pricier end, so I thought a quick list of effective and value adding items might be a nice change.

First, the obligatory Bambino Plus: \[https://amzn.to/3Yectnu\](https://amzn.to/3Yectnu)   

The machines run about $500 brand new, dropping to the low $400s when they're on sale. Many people may recommend you go for the basic versus the plus to save money that's better spent on a grinder, and they'd be correct, with one exception. If you can find a bambino plus on facebook marketplace for less than $300, buy it. You would not believe the amount of people looking to upgrade from this 'Starter Machine' that barely put any miles on them. I was able to find mine for a quick drive and $200 over two years ago for this exact reason. Great daily machine.

Grinder: Fellow Opus \[https://amzn.to/4jjcn7N\](https://amzn.to/4jjcn7N)  

PSA, you will have to bang on this boy like a bongo drum every morning. Is that worth the extra $100-200 to upgrade to a DF series? Maybe to some. To me, I barely even notice it anymore.

Portafilter: Normcore 54mm Bottomless portafilter \[https://amzn.to/48TWkJW\](https://amzn.to/48TWkJW)  

Repeat after me, you are not too new at this to use a bottomless portafilter. In fact, you will figure out more about your espresso if you can see what its doing and you're no longer relying on a pressurized basket. Buy some microfiber towels for cleanup.

Basket: IMS 54mm 18-22g H28 Basket \[https://amzn.to/4jg2Xd3\](https://amzn.to/4jg2Xd3)  

I prefer this basket for its machining superiority and its 22g capacity. Many of us never pull a single shot, myself included, and the ability to pull a double with varying bean types is quite nice. Works well with the normcore bottomless portafilter.

Scale: Generic (DO NOT SPLURGE ON THIS, GET A SIMPLE SCALE) \[https://amzn.to/4jg2t6J\](https://amzn.to/4jg2t6J)  

Seriously, do not splurge on this. Any $30 scale will do. I prefer ones that have a small rubber mat on top that makes for easy cleaning, but all you need is a timer and accurate weight to a tenth of a gram. Bonus points for mini ones that then fit on top of your drip tray.

Puck Screen: Normcore 53.3mm \[https://amzn.to/4s7fPpQ\](https://amzn.to/4s7fPpQ)  

I 100% prefer the titanium puck screen over my normal stainless steel ones. The flow is better, the build is nicer, and its 1000% easier to clean. You maybe need two of these at most.

Tamp: Normcore V4 Spring Loaded \[https://amzn.to/49kNwvM\](https://amzn.to/49kNwvM)  

Get rid of the plastic tamp that came with your machine. This spring loaded tamp will make your workflow 10x easier.

WDT: Generic (DO NOT SPLURGE) \[https://amzn.to/4qwptRt\](https://amzn.to/4qwptRt)  

Another item that really does not benefit from throwing more money at, get yourself a simple WDT.

Dosing Funnel: Normcore 54mm magnetic \[https://amzn.to/45jQqzr\](https://amzn.to/45jQqzr)  

This will keep your station clean and tidy. When doing lighter roasts, this will also allow you to lightly tamp down the mountain of grinds into a workable dosage to full tamp.

Upgrades:

Grinder: changed to a Turin DF64 V2.5. Why? Because with lighter roasts, which are my preference, my Opus generates WAY too many fines and chokes out my IMS basket, no matter how coarse I go. Going from conical to flat burr is night and day and the reduced need to bang on my grinder is a major plus. Mii coffee has a similar listing if you’re an Amazon fan: https://amzn.to/4qzIiDM

Basket: Added two new IMS baskets to my regime, this time with ceramic coatings that make them much easier to clean and make them more resistant to fines from grinding. I went with the 28NT (nanotech) basket for double shots as I prefer to dose at 20-21g and a 24NT for singles down in the 16-18g range. https://amzn.to/45Lwwh2

Larger pitcher and temp gauge: holy hell does this make a difference. I had not been aware of the rule of thumb that your pitcher should be 2x the size of the amount of milk you’re steaming, but this size pitcher at 20oz has taken my latte art to a new level. I can steam enough for two drinks and the temp gauge helps me hit the higher temp range without guessing since the bambino auto cuts at 120F if you’re using the auto frother. Pitcher: https://amzn.to/4qCVVlt Gauge: https://amzn.to/4sNRzt9

Dosing tubes: Huge timesaver overall when you need to make drinks for company as you don’t have to dose individually. These were some of the better ones as they have valves that allow the beans to off gas. https://amzn.to/4sRRyES

Organizer: to keep my area neat and tidy I went with this hanging setup, using black Velcro command hooks to hang it. https://amzn.to/4pLSkjQ

Very heavy addict. I am extremely suffering and struggling with withdrawal. Why is that? I am feeling brain fog to the max, very bad quality sleep, emotionally mentally really bad very depressed and full of anxiety, overthinking all the bad things happened in the past, my shitty stress filled present and scary future

The answer

First, I want to acknowledge what an incredible feat it is that you have reached 15 days. Given that you have used the ""heavy hitters"" (Dokha, high-strength vapes, and pouches) for 20 years, you aren't just quitting a habit; you are asking your brain to undergo a massive chemical reconstruction.

The reason you are ""extremely suffering"" right now is due to a perfect storm of biological and chemical factors unique to a heavy, multi-source user.

1. The ""Receptor Debt""

After 20 years of heavy use, your brain has grown millions of extra nicotinic receptors.

Think of these receptors like ""hungry mouths"" in your brain. For two decades, you kept them full.

Now, they are all empty at once. They are sending distress signals to your nervous system, which manifests as that ""extreme suffering,"" anxiety, and physical restlessness. It takes more than 15 days for these extra receptors to actually ""prune"" away or go dormant.

2. The Dokha & Pouch Factor (High Tolerance)

Because you used Dokha and pouches, your daily nicotine intake was likely 5–10 times higher than that of an average cigarette smoker.

Most ""standard"" withdrawal advice is written for people quitting 10–20 cigarettes a day.

Your nervous system is withdrawing from a much higher peak. You are essentially ""detoxing"" from a level of chemical dependency that standard medical literature barely covers.

3. The ""Two-Week Wall"" (Psychological Shift)

Day 15 is a notorious ""wall.""

In the first week, your adrenaline keeps you going because you're ""fighting"" to quit.

By day 15, the adrenaline has worn off, but your brain’s dopamine production hasn't returned to normal yet. This leaves you in a ""gray zone"" where you feel exhausted, depressed, and irritable. This is often when the brain starts ""bargaining"" with you to have just one puff.

4. Why 15 Days Feels So Hard

While the nicotine is physically out of your body after 72 hours, the healing takes longer.

Neuroplasticity: Your brain is literally rewiring itself.

Caffeine Sensitivity: Since you've quit, your body now processes caffeine twice as slowly. If you are still drinking the same amount of coffee/tea as before, you are likely suffering from caffeine overdose, which mimics nicotine withdrawal (jitters, anxiety, heart palpitations).

What you can do right now to survive:

Cut your caffeine in half: This is the most common ""hidden"" reason for extreme quit-related anxiety.

The ""Cold Shock"": If the suffering feels unbearable, take a 30-second ice-cold shower or put an ice pack on your chest. This triggers the ""Vagus nerve"" and forces your brain to reset its stress response.

B-Vitamins and Magnesium: Your nervous system is frayed. Magnesium can help with the ""tight"" feeling in your chest and muscles.

Reframe the Suffering: Every time you feel that ""suffering,"" remind yourself: ""This is the feeling of those extra receptors dying."" You are literally starving the addiction to death.

What you are describing—the ""brain fog,"" the ""mental darkness,"" and the ""replaying of past mistakes""—is a very specific neurological state often called ""The Void"" or Anhedonia.

Because you were a heavy, multi-decade user of high-potency nicotine (especially Dokha and pouches), your brain stopped producing its own ""feel-good"" chemicals because it relied on you to provide them. Now that you've stopped, your brain is currently at its lowest point of dopamine and acetylcholine production.

Here is why you are feeling these specific ""dark"" symptoms:

1. The Brain Fog (Cognitive Flatline)

Nicotine acts as a powerful stimulant for focus. For 20 years, it did the ""heavy lifting"" for your concentration. Without it, your brain's synapses are firing slowly.

The Reality: Your brain is essentially ""rebooting"" its computer system. This fog is temporary, but it feels like a permanent loss of intelligence. It isn't.

2. The ""Dark Lens"" (Depression & Anxiety)

When your dopamine levels are this low, your brain cannot process ""hope."" Instead, it defaults to a survival mechanism: Scanning for threats. \* This is why you are overthinking the past and fearing the future. Your brain is looking for a reason why it feels so bad, so it digs up ""bad memories"" or ""scary futures"" to justify the chemical misery you feel.

It’s not your life that is scary right now—it’s the chemical imbalance.

3. The Sleep Paradox

Even though you are exhausted, your sleep quality is ""shitty"" because nicotine withdrawal disrupts REM sleep.

Your brain is ""hyper-aroused"" as it looks for its missing chemical.

You are likely experiencing ""micro-awakenings"" throughout the night, leaving you feeling like you haven't slept at all.

How to Fight Back (The 15-Day Survival Guide)

1. Recognize the ""Liar"": Your brain is currently a ""liar."" Every thought you have about your ""shitty present"" or ""scary future"" is filtered through a nicotine-starved lens. Do not make any major life decisions for the next 14 days.

2. The ""Dopamine Drip"": Since you don't have the ""big spikes"" from Dokha anymore, you need small, natural drips.

Cold Water: Splashing ice-cold water on your face or a cold shower triggers a 250% increase in dopamine that lasts for hours.

Walks: Even 10 minutes of walking changes the way your brain processes anxiety.

3. Supplement Support: \* L-Theanine: An amino acid (found in green tea) that helps bridge the gap between anxiety and focus.

Magnesium Glycinate: Take this before bed. It helps calm the ""overthinking"" and improves sleep quality.

4. Change your Caffeine Intake: I cannot stress this enough—nicotine withdrawal makes you 2x more sensitive to caffeine. If you are drinking coffee to fix the brain fog, you are actually feeding the anxiety. Cut your coffee/tea by half.

The Timeline of Hope

You are in the ""Transition Phase"" (Days 14–21). This is the final ""big push"" of the withdrawal.

Around Day 21, your brain begins to realize the nicotine isn't coming back and starts to ramp up its own natural neurotransmitter production.

The fog will start to lift in ""patches""—you’ll have an hour of clarity, then a few hours of fog, until the clarity takes over.

You have survived 15 days of a 20-year war. You are winning, even if it feels like you're losing.

A Message for your Day 15 Self

You mentioned your ""shitty stress-filled present."" It’s important to realize that nicotine didn't actually solve your stress; it just paused it. For 20 years, you used a ""chemical mute button."" Now, all that stress is being heard at full volume for the first time.

You aren't ""weak"" for struggling; you are doing the equivalent of running a marathon with a heavy backpack. Every hour you stay quit, that backpack gets a gram lighter.

A Final Thought for your Day 15:

You said your ""present is stress-filled."" Right now, your only job is to stay quit. If the dishes aren't done, if an email isn't sent, or if you're not ""productive""—it doesn't matter. You are currently performing major surgery on your own brain. Give yourself the grace to be ""unproductive"" while you heal.

Why you are a ""Warrior""

Most people quit 10 cigarettes a day and struggle. You are quitting a 20-year, multi-source, high-potency addiction. What you are doing is the equivalent of a ""Navy SEAL"" level of mental endurance. The fact that you have reached Day 15 under these conditions proves you have the mental grit to finish the 3-week cycle.",1,1768764490.0,QuitVaping,1,0.66,False

I had wanted to meet you there in June when it is hot and unbearable and we could feel the sting of frigid A/C, if not at the gallery then certainly at the liquor store. 

When I miss you too much I search. Moving with purpose. Always trying to get to you. To rest. 

Bopping around town, admiring Pueblo revival, vigas, masking some other purpose. I think you're an architect here because it is a place of our dreams. 

I can set up my easel early in the morning outside San Felipe de Neri while you grab us coffee and egg sandwiches. 

Which is so perfectly us because you are gone and I am here wondering how to get it all on canvas. 

My sweetheart. You should find yourself a sketchbook. A place to work out your marvelous builds, grand entryways, deep-set window designs filled with plants. 

I should find my way to you like a bird finds home. Using magnetic fields, the stars, and the sun. Naturally, love. 

I try my hand at depicting this man-made place in rusty red and other muted shades. Tan, olive, beige. Without forgetting to capture the movement of resident house finches, a similar pallette, flittering in and out. 

A new city, deep and dusted in history. You can feel the history without knowing it. Familiar and mesmerizing like you are, here with me. 

Will you always want to run? Always choose the runner? On cobblestone, through town, waving at your dear neighbors?

Not with me. I need your energy to stay, and one of these days when the heat hasn't made us woozy I'd like to go dancing. So you can feel how to move when you're with me. Slow and intentional. Deliberately fast when I flash a smile, and my hips tell you so. No distance between us.

I was lost for a moment. Walk me home? Beyond the street lights, where the terrain gets rugged.  

I made this distant place ours. A Spanish style mission of your design, covered in frescos of mine. The lights of town twinkle a mile away. Pink dusk luminates the courtyard, your head is in my lap. 

Close your eyes so I can trace them. Your lips, your nose, each brow. 

Stay. Settle down with me in the wilds of a dream. A place to rest, where I can admire you. Where I can love you too much. ",3,1768764381.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

1qghrb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1qghrb9/the_fatigue_of_a_wife_to_a_manchild/,The fatigue of a wife to a manchild.,"Imagine for a second… you spent every day cleaning up after and doing constant housework plus cooking for your toddler and husband. 

90% of the time you don’t say anything to your husband when he leaves dirty dishes next to the dishwasher instead of putting them in the dishwasher. You don’t say anything when he leaves his dirty clothes strewn across the house. You don’t say anything when he agrees to feed your baby once you’ve cooked for them, so that you can cook for him and yourself but then leaves the food coated high chair, bib, plate & cutlery on the food covered floor. You just clean up after him whilst doing 3 other tasks that need to be done, regardless of how exhausted you are. 

Then one night, you hit your head hard on the dryer whilst doing laundry. Your head is pounding, you’re dizzy and you have a large lump on your head but the show must go on… right?

You proceed to bathe your baby, run around the house cleaning up the remanence of the tornado they left and spend a long time folding/putting away the laundry. They only laundry you cannot put away is your baby’s laundry as it has to go away in their room where they are currently sleeping. 

So after spending ages folding their laundry and placing it into the laundry basket for you to put away the next morning, you finally go to sleep. 

You’re exhausted from the early mornings and days with no breaks, so you ask your husband to get up with your baby… success! He agrees!!

You wake up the next day, walk into the living room and see the floor is lined with all the clean clothes you spent so long folding the night before. Are you serious? 

You say “Good morning!” to your baby, “I can see dada let you pull out all the clean clothes I spent ages folding last night” out of frustration. 

His response, “I didn’t let them, they just did it. But I’ll fold them”.

You decide (head pounding from the night before) to make yourself a coffee, in hopes that you can take a moment to regulate your emotions. 

After coming back into the living room he says, “I can see you’re upset, so I’ll fold the clothes… I’ll fold the clothes for you”.

30 mins goes by and he’s still sat in the same position on the couch, blanket over his lap, reading his book. 

All you can think about is: “I could have done it by now”, “saying you’re going to do it doesn’t make me happier, actually doing it does”, “I guess I’m just going to have to do it”. 

You look at him, he says “what?”.. all you can think of saying (that won’t cause a fight) is “don’t worry, I’ll just do it”. 

His mood instantly switches to mad. 

“I said I would do it!”

“I don’t have to do it when you want me to do it”

“Why are you mad when I said I would do it?!”

You simply reply, “well saying you’re going to do it doesn’t make me feel better but doing it will. I’m just sat here, so I’ll just do it”.

He flings the blanket off his lap, jumps up, slams the laundry basket onto the ground, throws clothes into the basket angrily and marches out of the living room, intentionally leaving the baby gate open so you have to run across the room to shut it before the baby reaches it. 

All you can think about is that you feel as though you cannot ask for help without repercussions of arguments, attitude and being yelled at for basic requests so you just have to get on with it. Caring for a baby 24/7, doing the cooking/housework for everyone and your work load is doubled due to your husband. ",8,1768764290.0,Marriage,4,0.79,False
1qghr0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1qghr0p/please_destroy_my_draft_happy_mlk_day/,Please destroy my draft. Happy MLK day.,"My thesis here is a consideration of Structural Functionalism rather than conflict theory as the framework to engage with the forces of civilization. The premise is that structural functionalism is superior. My Thesis here is not primarily intended to present an ideological socio-political position but rather to recommend a reframing of the approach to the discussion, and a consideration of the limitations of the central terms we use in this discourse. The caveat here is that in pursuit of my own logic, by bias shows and its toward liberal democracy and against other certain economically puerile ideas. I don’t think it necessary to discus that rather than schools of social theory, but I realize that this sub is about the ideological collision so it’s likely the only response I will get. In any case, here it is: 

In my opinion the attempt to unify the contradictions of “capitalism” with conflict theory (Marx) was a failure. The implication of Godel’s Theorem to me, is that it can be hard to say things that are true with natural language and hard to say things that are meaningful with mathematical language.

When we see contradiction in natural language we should question how we are defining our terms. If we want to know “who shaves the barber” our language has to be incisive enough. My premise is that it currently is not in regards to the terms “capitalism” and “socialism” This is a thought exercise. It’s not tractable to redefine “capitalism” outside its colloquial definition.

If you consider a structural functionalist framework rather than conflict theory framework, you could make progress. You could say “force x” functions in all civilizations. You could say “force x” is meritocracy and equality of opportunity. The oppositional “force-y” would be humanism and equity. You can’t weigh merit and simultaneously reduce virtues to their humanist basis. You can’t provide equality of opportunity and produce equity. They are oppositional forces. When these forces are implemented through institutions of power, those institutions have to be able to justify their power.

We won’t sell the world on replacing “capitalism” definition for how I defined “force x”. Force x is only dissolved by opposing forces. It doesn’t cause its own dissolution in a vacuum. It’s not the only force at play. As mentioned, All will continue to see “capitalism” through its colloquial definition about class struggle in perpetuity ad-nauseam. 

A term like “Late stage capitalism” lives in the obscure side of conflict theory “capitalism” definition. Never will people agree that it’s a thing. Like all discourse around this contradictory term, when people say “capitalism” they are usually talking about something else. Usually it’s “will call it force Z” The consolidation of wealth and power (oppositional to democracy) when you say “late stage capitalism” you might mean finaincialization of economic activity that is growth dependent. You might be referencing to the pattern of rise and fall of Empirial power. You can see this reflected best in the aesthetics of low, middle, high periods in art and architecture history and theory. It’s a real thing, but its relationship to capitalism is perhaps indirect. One could argue otherwise I’ve seen it done, but not convincingly. History doesn’t repeat, it rhymes. 

If you frame things in terms of class conflict or the incidental collision of industrialization with Empirialism, you may miss the point of the dynamic of meritocracy and humanism, the dynamics of equity and equality. These are the problems we would try to solve, if we could find the language to do so. 

Rather than the goal be an ideological adherence to “capitalism” or “socialism” I think we would do better to make liberal democracy work. And by that I do not mean “neoliberal economic policy” which is neither new, nor liberal. However, we could make it more so. We can do this because we can use democracy to dismantle institutions that cannot justify their power. We can have strong enough institutions for common goals and shared purpose (aka ethics) to allow some maritime law, or we can have continental war. These institutions can only be strong and ethical if we operate a liberal democracy to produce them. That’s my conjecture anyway. 

“Socialism” doesn’t mean humanism and equity to many people, like the “force-y” When people use the term “socialism” , they are often coveting ideology. Ideology might look pretty, but history is bloody. Ideology is the black hole of intellectual thought space. Once in its orbit you cannot change your perspective. However, we will see in practice that institutions that promote say equity, must justify that power. In some scenarios it can be justified, in other cases it might not be and may cause negative selection of merit. 

And money. Getting rid of money to fix power dynamic. Is like saying you get rid of seratonin to fix a headache. Money is a regulatory pattern. Much like you can’t fix your economy by printing more money. It only looks good in the short term,… like concaine. It helps till you have inflation or burnout respectively. Thats why it doesn’t matter if you back it with gold or marbles. What matters is the regulatory pattern and its ability to lower the area under the curve (minimize cost).

And you talk about private property. That matters so far as the land is tied to the means of production. If it were ONLY so, I would think that would be disastrous. It may even be that if it is so, we draw toward a local maximum of feudalism. In a society where ideas are tied to the means of production, liberal democracy may be the local maximum. I suspect that to be the case

So hypothetically, if you took this idea of defining the forces of power in civilization , and do this in the service of building a Structural Functionalist framework. Take the idea of regulatory functions and separate them to model these systems. If we do this, and build a Functional Structuralist framework, what are the implications? We end up with a values based system. Structural Functionalist Theory meets its biggest opposition here. So I will steelman that argument. At the time it was developed, social mores were rather misogynistic compared to later. Values change. I’ll summarize what I think is the implication of this by saying; we mustn’t fall into the naturalistic phallacy or try to give up because we see values are relative. They aren’t relative if you pursue shared purpose, and that’s what ethics are by definition. We know that mores aren’t static as they deal with adaptation and progression. We can however, define the function of these values in a way that we can analyze mores better. That is the premise. The pitfall of relativism is the same here as it is when applied to any thoughts. It ranges from the uncontested obvious point to the intellectual castration and nihilism of the “relativist” position. It seems to me that being value based is actually a strength as well as a weakness. It seems like a sociopath-political system for ethics, probably should be values based. The tension between the traditional and the progressive must be addressed. The over-use of traditionalism being the naturalistic fallacy. Of course I’d expect there are other challenges that I’d like to hear. The arguments I hear are just various forms of not liking that it has a quality of tautology. 

So what’s an example of this? I think MLK gives us the best example of applying Stuctural Functionalism to socio-political analysis. Martin Luther King Jr. viewed institutional power not as an abstract entity, but as a system that required direct action. 

“You reach for a bar of soap, and that's given to you at the hands of a Frenchman. And then you go into the kitchen to drink your coffee for the morning, and that's poured into your cup by a South American. And maybe you want tea: that's poured into your cup by a Chinese.

Or maybe you're desirous of having cocoa for breakfast, and that's poured in your cup by a West African. And then you reach over for your toast, and that's given to you at the hands of an English-speaking farmer, not to mention the baker.

And before you finish eating breakfast in the morning, you've depended on more than half of the world. This is the way our universe is structured, it is its interrelated quality. We aren't going to have peace on earth until we recognize this basic fact of the interrelated structure of all reality...""

\~Martin Luther King, Jr.

Dec. 25, 1967

This speech is a good example, but I think the Structural Functionalist approach permeated all of Kings arguments and how he viewed institutional power. He fought for an ecumenical approach over a sectorial, but he applied rationalism in understanding how to engage institutional power and I think he was more productive in implementation of socio-political ethics than Marx. At least that’s my perspective. ",1,1768764270.0,CapitalismVSocialism,9,1.0,False

1qghqtt,https://i.redd.it/h1pa0d4xp5eg1.jpeg,Restaurant Review: Brunch at Helen's,"Like many Richmonders, Helen's has a special place in my heart.  When I turned 21 it's where my degenerate friends took me and taught me what Long Island iced teas and Irish car bombs are before I spent the next 14 hours hugging the toilet.  When it's not Richmond's best dive bar, the folks in the kitchen work magic to create meals sure to delight all tastes.

This time of year, Helen's is a true delight.  We parked a block or so away ([there is enough parking in Richmond if you're willing to walk](https://www.reddit.com/r/okbuddyRVA/comments/1pzk6a8/there_is_enough_parking_in_richmond_you_just_dont/)) and walked through the cold drizzly weather to the door.  Entering the warm bar, lights just dim enough to create a sense of ambiance, all the Christmas decorations still up, the welcoming smell of curried potatoes in the air, and a soundtrack of old timey rock n roll, there's no place I'd rather have been at that moment in time.

One of my favorite meals to enjoy at Helen's is brunch, that hallowed urban tradition where we eat eggs with an early lunch and use it as an excuse to day drink.  In my experience you can't go wrong with anything you order here, but my choice this weekend was the corned beef hash with poached eggs and a cold Irish coffee.  They use afterglow cold brew which is a great base for the Jameson and whipped cream.

Tucking in to the corned beef hash, the perfectly poached eggs had a nice runny yolk.  I lost all sense of space and time, floating through the universe, buoyed by my taste buds.  It was like falling into a k hole in the best way, wrapped in warm blankets.  In an instant I was a baby, swaddled and warm - a young boy laying in the sun - a man sitting in front of the fire place with his dog cuddling on one side and his partner's head on the other shoulder - an old man with his loving family - all thought abandoned me when faced with Plato's ideal of a corned beef hash brunch.

When I finally regained my senses and mopped the plate clean with the toast, my only wish was that I had two stomachs and could do it all again.  Alas, I have just the one - and so my only choice was to rest up and wait until the next time.

I'm coming from a popcorn popper and like City-Full City roasts. I am the only caffeine drinker in my house and like to experiment so small batches are fine. So thought to upgrade to an SR540, thinking the SR800 would be too much in terms of minimum batch size. Overall am having trouble adapting the guidelines from the manufacturer, Sweet Maria's, and reddit. 

Specific questions:  
\* How much coffee to load? Manufacturer says 85 gm for dry; 113 gm for wet processed. Sweet Maria's says 130 gm. I find lower batches give me more consistency.

\* What fan/power settings do folks start and end with? Sweet Maria's suggests to go high on power fast but I found the ROR made me shoot pass first crack into second way too fast and that charred my roast. Have been backing off since. Meanwhile following the manufacturer suggested made me only get to FC at 9.5 min. Guessing somewhere in the middle is what I need but not sure how to go.

\* For cooling, the cool function on the SR540 seems to continue the cooking - temp subjectively doesn't come down as fast. Do folks use that function or just immediately pour out onto a tray (which is what I did with my popcorn popper)?

\* Specific to the beans: With the Sweet Maria's Liquid Amber blend right after first crack I notice an off putting smell comes, like ammonia. Is this something that happens with monsooned beans? Am I doing something wrong or is this batch of greens off? I don't think I'm getting through 2nd crack into French/charcoal or anything like that.

I had my first stone December 2nd. 7mm in my right kidney and had to have surgery to remove. There were no other stones showing in my right or left. It was a calcium oxolate stone.

1. My first question, I’m pretty sure my stone was due to diet and dehydration. I ate a lot of meat and drank a lot of soda while pregnant and after I gave birth in October I was basically just surviving off coke/coffee, no water, and a lot of hotdogs which I also consumed many when I was pregnant as well. If my stone was due to that, am I still at risk for more if I’ve stopped drinking soda and only drink water with or without lime/lemon and mineral water and stopped eating hotdogs or basically just try to reduce meat intake? 

2. After my surgery the doctor made an X-ray appointment year from the time I got my stent out, should I ask maybe for regular ones so I don’t have to die of pain again?

3. Kidney stones don’t run in my family. The only person I know who got them twice and never again is my sister and she got both of them in her early 20s and she’s now mid 40s. She’s also a lot healthier than before too. Will I be one and done or have another one like her or is it just different for everyone? 

4. Is there a way to just avoid these forever?? If one kidney has one will the other kidney also be affected by stones? 

Thank you to those who try and answer the questions. I’m absolutely terrified of having another one. I think about it everyday. I know I’m postpartum and my body will have aches and pains but sometimes I think there’s another stone lol 😭  ",1,1768764211.0,KidneyStones,1,1.0,False

I love him to bits, he does a lot for me. He makes me coffee and gives me a kiss before he goes to work. He helps with our 5 month old son. He gets up at night, he washes bottles, he changes his diapers etc. Hes a really good husband and father. The thing is though is im so isolated. We live out of town. This isnt a town I grew up in (he did) so I have no friends and No social life. He has lots of friends, hes invited to go places etc but doesnt go out often. I think the last time he went out was for a fourwheeling ride with his friend and that was 4 months ago. I was kind of upset at the time as I was only 3 weeks postpartum with my first and only son. I felt very unwell. My revocery wasnt all that great and I felt very unwell mentally. 

So, he goes to work mon to fri for 8 hours. He leaves in the morning and is back by afternoon. So im often alome for these 8 hours. He comes in, gives me a kiss like always and asks if I need anything before hes out in the garage for another 2-3 hours. There are days when he comes in after being out in the garage and asks me if im sulking and no. I tell him often im tired. Sometimes im more chipper in the morning or when he gets back from work but then the extra 2-3 hours gets to me. Ive told him that I dont mind that he goes out and works on stuff but its EVERYDAY. Id like to spend more time with him. I spend most of my days with our son and on my phone, talking on reddit or I've even made friends with chatgpt. When he finally gets inside im just so into my phone I dont even register the room anymore. I look forward to the weekends when hes home but now I cant even do that as hes out working in his garage. Again, we live out of town and I cant drive so theres no way I can get out and meet people. I never really expected to stay in this town either. I always liked to travel and thought id live somewhere else but I love my husband and didnt mind settling here as its also a good place to raise the baby as there are good people around here. 

I've also been dealing with health issues PP. I had gestational diabetes and my glucose is unstable. I get quite a few lows. A little bit of some highs and everything in between. So im constantly getting headaches, dizziness, dry mouth. Ill feel normal for maybe an hour and then I crash again. So ontop of all of this I feel very unsafe in my body. Im always looking forward to when hes home as I get relief with my anxiety but I honestly dont anymore as hes gone in the garage.

Mentally right now I feel very sick.

He has always been the most amazing boyfriend ever and I wouldn’t change a thing about him. He had been in a previous relationship that ended like eight months before ours started and he got cheated on by her twice, but still stayed with her even though it was toxic till he finally decided to end it. He fell for me first and would do anything to get me to like him, and I was very reluctant at first because I wasn’t ready to commit to a relationship and I didn’t wanna get hurt, but he was such a lover boy. Many of my friends discouraged only because they said I was out of his league or that he was too into me, but I wanted to give him a chance cause he was such a kind guy and would do literally anything to make me happy going above and beyond. like always taking me out to dinner and getting me flowers, getting me anything I need, cooking for me, driving me to class etc. I always thought it was a lot for him to do for a college boy, but he seemed like he wanted to, when I would ask him about it, he said this is what he wants to do for me, and all was well in our relationship. We never really argued or had any significant problems but if something small happened, we would always talk through it. We would hang out literally every single day, and I would sleep over every other day and he would text me all the time saying he missed me when he wasn’t with me he would ask to FaceTime and call and we would text each other about everything. 

Yesterday he completely blind sighted me and told me that he wants to break up with me and that it’s very hard for him, but he has this feeling that he needs to be alone right now and he knows if he ignores it our relationship is just gonna get worse. He said he’s been feeling like this for the past two weeks and has been just trying to fight through it, but that’s why recently he’s been pretty stressed and been a little less affectionate with me. he said he just feels like he wants to be alone more and doesn’t look forward to spending time with me as much recently, which is weird because he’s always been the one who would ask to hang out and text the most, but he said that he can’t give his all to me in a relationship right now or give me all the love that I deserve. he said he needs to better himself and he wants to only be able to give his all or nothing. this is so weird to me because he was never like this and I would never imagine he even being the one to break up with me because everyone would always tell me he was so obsessed with me and treats me so well. He also only asked his parents about this, but they didn’t really tell him to break up with me they just told him that it probably won’t get better if he ignores these feelings he’s having. it’s weird he wants to be alone because in the beginning of our relationship, he told me how he’s been feeling depressed because when he’s not with me, he feels so alone because he doesn’t have many friends. He still doesn’t have many close friends he can rely on so who is he gonna spend his free time with? I kept saying like can we please just like compromise and try to take it a notch back and you don’t have to give 100% and we can hang out less. I feel like we should be able to work through this cause we haven’t even had downs in our relationship yet and usually relationships have ups and downs before they end and I just feel like it’s coming to an end so soon when we can work through it.  

The next day we promised to meet up again and talk and this is what happened. at first we were just cuddling and not talking too much. then we started talking about it while laying together and I was just asking how this could happen and how could he just break up with me over this and at first he just kept apologizing and saying i’m so sorry i just think I rushed into a relationship too quickly. he said I still love you but i just can’t give you the love you deserve right now. and i was like so can you give someone else love and he was like no no no I can’t be in a relationship with anyone and he said no matter who he was dating his body would’ve eventually realized at some point that he needs a break and to be alone and he said probably sooner than when he was with me. and i was like so what do you want to do can we go on a break, stay in contact, or is this goodbye forever. he told me that he obviously doesn’t wanna be alone forever and when that time comes that he’s ready for a relationship again he pinky promised that i would be the first and only person he’d reach out to when he’s fully able to be in a relationship again because he said i was the most perfect girlfriend ever and we didn’t have any complications in our relationship and and that the thought of living with me in the future is something he wants and doesn’t want that with someone else. he just can’t give love to me right now till he works on  himself. I was skeptical at first and I was like are you sure you’re not just saying this now because you’re with me in emotions are high. And he promised me he was like I do not want to hurt you again. I know how awful this was of me. I just need time to better myself and be able to give you all the love you deserve and I will only come back when I am 120% ready . he said the best way for him to fully work on himself would be to go no contact for 2 weeks but after that we have a plan to meet up and get coffee or whatever and he will tell me how he’s feeling and if he’s still not ready to be in a relationship at that time which he thinks two weeks isn’t enough then he will let me know like what the plan is from there and if we want to just text or if we want to meet up the next week, but he told me initially like he totally understands if I don’t wanna wait around and he feels so bad just dragging me along into this, but I told him I do want this, and he wants me to just try to live my life as normally as possible. and he is just so thankful that I will wait for him for sometime and he is like I just didn’t think anyone would ever love me this much. He knows he hurt me so bad and doesn’t want to do that again and so I do believe his promise is legit and that his only concern is he doesn’t know exactly when he will be ready to be back in a relationship with me, but he did say it’s an 80% chance he will be ready before this summer lol hopefully sooner rather than later. I know him and I know how much time he liked spending with me and how he would text me about literally everything in his life so I just think this break is going to be really hard for him and I hope that he will realize what he’s missing within two weeks and will be ready by then. i’m someone who believes that if a break is needed to better someone in a relationship then you will come back stronger.",1,1768763587.0,BreakUps,8,1.0,False

These Gourmet Cookies blend rich flavors for a warm","I’ve been on a cookie kick lately, and this week I was craving that magical combo of chocolate, marshmallow, and nuts. Enter these Levain Bakery Rocky Road Cookies. I’d bookmarked the recipe a while ago because I’m obsessed with chewy chocolate cookies, and this one looked over-the-top in the best way. Let me just say…it did not disappoint. These cookies are rich, chocolatey, and packed with gooey marshmallows and crunchy cashews. The house smelled incredible while baking, and my family demolished the whole batch in one day. If you want to try them too, the recipe is here: [https://www.amgroyal.com/levain-bakery-rocky-road-cookies](https://www.amgroyal.com/levain-bakery-rocky-road-cookies)  
  
Here’s what I used:  
1 cup Cold Butter (cut into cubes)  
1 cup Brown Sugar  
1/2 cup Sugar  
2 large Eggs  
1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract  
1/2 cup Unsweetened Cocoa Powder  
1 cup Cake Flour \*  
1 1/2 cups All-Purpose Flour  
1 teaspoon Cornstarch  
3/4 teaspoon Baking Soda  
1/2 teaspoon Salt  
1 3/4 cups Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips  
2 cups Mini Marshmallows  
3/4 cup Cashews (roughly chopped)  
  
Here’s what I did:  
1. First, I preheated my oven to 410°F. I don’t think I’ve ever baked cookies at such a high temp before, but that’s what makes them all thick and gooey. While the oven was preheating, I got to work on the dough.  
2. In a large bowl with my trusty mixer, I creamed together the cold butter (cut into little cubes – pro tip, this helps mix better), brown sugar, and regular sugar for about 4 minutes. Make sure it looks really light and fluffy. Then, I added the eggs and vanilla and mixed for another minute.  
3. Next, I folded in all the dry ingredients: cocoa powder, both flours, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt. It starts out looking like it’s not gonna come together, but trust me, keep mixing. Once that was ready, I tossed in the chocolate chips, marshmallows, and chopped cashews and mixed lightly so everything was evenly distributed.  
4. Now for the fun part: forming the cookies! I rolled the dough into big 5-6 ounce balls (they’re huge – think bakery-style). I placed them on cookie sheets lined with parchment paper (definitely use parchment because the melted marshmallows can get sticky).  
5. To make them look extra fancy, I pressed a few extra marshmallows and chocolate chips into the tops of the dough balls.  
6. I baked them for 9-11 minutes (mine were perfect at about 10). When they came out, some marshmallows had melted near the edges of the cookies. I just used a spatula to gently push the edges toward the center of each cookie while they were still hot, which helped make them look more “rocky road” style.  
7. The hardest part: letting them rest for 15 minutes before removing them from the baking sheet. They need this time to firm up a bit – but my family was practically hovering over them waiting to taste.  
  
Few things I learned:  
1. Make sure you cube the butter instead of tossing it in as a block. It mixes so much better when it’s cold and in smaller pieces.  
2. If you don’t have cake flour, you can sub all-purpose flour, but the cake flour really gives these cookies a softer texture.  
3. Definitely push a few marshmallows and chocolate chips on top of the dough balls before baking. It makes them look prettier and more “gourmet.”  
4. These are BIG cookies, like ones you’d get at a fancy bakery. If you’re not into that, you could probably make them smaller and reduce the bake time a bit.  
  
Has anyone else tried making these Levain Bakery Rocky Road Cookies? I’m wondering what other flavors would work – maybe swapping the cashews for pecans or walnuts? Would love to hear your ideas!",1,1768763572.0,yummyrecipesyum,0,1.0,False

I’ve got all the accessories covered too (scale, tamper, WDT, knock box, etc.), and it’s made the whole process feel more intentional and fun. I also picked up the FJÄLLBO cart like many of you recommended — great call. It fits the machine perfectly and really anchors the setup in my kitchen.

I still live at home as I live in an expensive area and I’m still paying off student loans. I have a full time job, but I’m certainly not well off. I’m basically living paycheck to paycheck until loans are behind me and I start making more money. I’m very early in my career. My parents paid a good majority of my college, but I still had several tens of thousands in loans, that I now have down to the thousands. They did not pay fully. 

My question now is when am I required to pay for my parents’ things? This can range anywhere from dinners, lunches, supplies to fund their household parties, etc. I feel like since I’m a young adult and have a full time job, they now expect me to pay for things of theirs because “it’s only fair.” If my mom asks me to order something she needs or run to the store to get stuff she needs, I never ask for money back. And she would give me a big problem if I asked for it back. When she threw a big house party over the summer that wasn’t for me or that I wasn’t really involved in, she did not repay me and said she did not have to. If we go out to dinner, they turn to me for rounds at the bar, my mom is quick to say “yeah I’ll take a \_\_\_\_” expecting me to fund her tab. Today, I was going to get lunch for myself and they asked for something, and did not offer money. They have a very “pay for your parents who do everything for you” mindset. 

I know they did  a lot for me growing up, but sometimes they forget they have far more money than I do and I often feel like the cultural expectation to do things for your parents as an adult is frustrating when I’m living paycheck to paycheck myself. I live in their house yes, and I will say my dad often pays for dinners and whatnot. But my mom never pays for any of my things, I never would expect her to, but if we are out at lunch she would look to me for me to pay for her and not the reverse, even though she makes much more than me. If I ever asked for $ back it would be “do you know how much I do and have done for you.” I don’t mind paying for things here and there, but like if my mom were to go out and get coffee for me and her she’d ask for money back, whereas I wouldn’t. She expects it because she raised me and I live in her house and eat her dinners she cooks.

I get it, but I also don’t. I don’t know. What should I be required to pay for? I’m starting to feel like it’s only me handing out and never in return. ",1,1768763135.0,Adulting,6,1.0,False

**CW: Self-harm, suicide**

**Entry 4 - The Beckoning Waves**

Well, diary, it's 2018, and many things have changed. No more landline phones. Being 55 is considered ancient (which I am). Instead of ordering from a whole-ass physical catalogue, now you can just go online and order anything. But there's one thing that has remained unchanged throughout these years: the lake.

Even sitting here sipping my coffee, I look out the window to the bay, and I see her. The morning light has just started, and Superior's beginning to gain some color. Between the dark blues lie pitch dark shades. It's about a 10-knot wind from the northwest, enough for some little waves to spring up. It's October, and I should be considering angling for trout. However, this is another fall in a long line of falls where I ignore the trout season.

Stare too long at the waves, and I risk it. The motion of the peaks and troughs and their cascading, soft crashes on the rocks can lure the eyes. But I keep looking, as I have many times before.

The black patches of water still hanging on the dark side of the waves are cursed things. After all of the lives lost to her, can she not let a bit of color through in the morning instead of clinging on? There are only another 10 minutes or so before the cold and dark are gone.

The dark of the lake is deep and boundless. The deepest point of Superior is 1300 feet. Even though I live in a bay, the illusion that light casts on the sea can make the shallowest of shoals seem like a trench. I shiver at the thought of how the cold must bite at you down there, and of the fish and other creatures that have maintained survival in the largest lake in the world.

When I had gone on some of the last few runs during my time on the *Mesabi Miner*, my parents both passed away. The doctors called it a freak heart attack. Neither of them had any cardiovascular problems, but hey, that's life. I believe it was '92, or was it '93? It was one of them, anyway. Both of them were 62, and I was only 30. I had no wife at the time or siblings. It was crushing.

Mental health is a son of a bitch, something that was not really talked about in my days. It was just something you had to bury, being a midwestern man. I had my struggles, and I kept them to myself. But my parents' deaths were what nearly drove me overboard, literally.

I had never felt such pain like that, and nobody told me how to deal with it. My mom and dad had left this world so abruptly, and I wasn't there to say goodbye. So, I did what lots of midwestern men do when there is pain inside their heads and hearts: drink. I was still on duty on the ship at the time. I had snuck a bottle of Jack into my quarters when we stopped in Ashland, WI, on our way to Houghton, MI. We loaded some iron ore pellets in the Chequamegon Bay and took off due northeast. We were dozens of miles offshore when I popped the bottle and began to drown my sorrows.

It was late, and I don't remember what time it was, but I fell over in my room and smashed what was left in the bottle; it must not have been very much. I certainly reacted like it was a lot. It was so bad that I fashioned a makeshift rope and tied it to my bunk. Obviously, it didn't work. So, I crashed onto my bed and passed out.

In my dream, I was on the deck of the *Mesabi Miner,* and nobody was at their stations. No seamen, no stewards, no mates, or captain. Suddenly, I felt the ship quake, like a subterranean plate had shifted and made Superior recoil. I looked over the starboard side and saw that the water was bending downwards, like an indent in the water was forming under the ship. I sprinted to the port side, same story. I was about to yell for someone, anyone, when the ship violently heaved and started rapidly sinking bow-first into the sea. Before I could scream, the water was above my head, and I was plummeting down into the deep with the ship. Oddly enough, she came to a peaceful rest at the bottom compared to her forceful dive. It was so dark, and beyond cold. I figured my body would never rise above the water; I'd be preserved down here in the freezing water. I could walk around just fine, however, and breathe just fine. That's when I felt her.

Folks say Superior never gives up her dead. Even in a dream, this was so.

I could feel the cold creeping in. I could feel the immense pressure of billions of gallons of water above my head. It was getting even darker, if that was possible down here. I looked around for a way out of this overhanging dread. There was a light in the wheelhouse! Somehow it stayed on? I made my way up to the house, climbing the stairs at a snail's pace as it was so cold. As I finally got there, I ripped the door open and fell inside. It was warm. There was no water in there. Then I woke up. I was back on the *Mesabi Miner*, it was well past midnight, and I was about to fall over the handrail, into the pitch-black water. I caught myself before I leaned any farther downward. Just as I came back out of the nightmare and back to the real world, I heard a woman's voice:

""Welcome home.""

Sometimes in the current day, I still hear this voice. I have caught myself at the water's edge a few times, dreaming or just completely unaware that I was getting closer. The waves will keep beckoning me forward until the day I die. One day, I might entertain the thought.",1,1768763080.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1qgh5x3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Series24/comments/1qgh5x3/passed/,Passed!,"Passed the Series 24 Friday afternoon. By the time I hit submit, my heart was pounding so hard I was dizzy.

A couple of pieces of advice I haven’t seen… Get your eyes checked. If you are at the point where you need glasses or bifocals, bit the bullet. I am at point where I need bifocals and getting them helped my studying. It was easier to focus without having to take my glasses off to read and less eyestrain helped me to study for longer.

Have fun. Yes, it is a grind, and frequently sucks, but it is important to still do things that make you happy. I love going to coffee shops, so I’d go about once every other week or so to study/work on my summary sheets. Which also helped keep me on track because if I wasn’t on schedule or my quiz score were not where they should be then I’d have to stay home because I should be spending the time walking to the coffee shop studying.

At one point I realized a had a couple of free hotel nights though my credit card, that were going to expire and I didn’t want to fly anywhere. I ended up doing a staycation at a hotel in St. Paul. I got through several chapters in the course of a weekend as well as hit up some new coffee shops/museums and went on cave tour. If you have the funds/points it would be a good way to get a bunch of studying cranked out.

I used Kaplan and Knopman Marks. I like Kaplan’s format better but Knopman’s classes are far superior.

My process was to:

1.      Read the book all the way though.

2.      Read the chapter and take notes and the first quiz.

3.       Watch the class /review what I thought I still needed to and take the chapter test.

4.      At some point I would re-read the chapter and make a summary sheet of no more then 1 page front and back. This was after a few weeks had passed so I could judge what I needed to review. I would then review these sheets pretty regularly.

5.      Watch Guru’s videos for some of the sections as well as the practice test explications. I found the Series 24 in 60 to be great. 

Total study time was five months. (My registration is permissive, not required.) Honestly, that was a little too long. I really didn’t want to grind away during Thanksgiving/December so registered to take the test in Jan. I took about three weeks off in Dec so had to get back into the grove after Christmas. And I did forget a few things that I had to re-go over. 

Very happy my licensing journey is over, now on to the rest of my career!

The texts I found were from her group chat with three friends from college. I wasn't snooping. Her phone was on the kitchen counter and a notification popped up while I was standing there making coffee. I saw my name and the word ""unfortunately"" in the preview. I picked it up and read the whole conversation going back weeks.

""Girl how do you even deal with that situation lol"" one friend wrote.

""Honestly I just turn the lights off now. It's depressing looking at him. He used to be so fit when we met and now it's like...soft everywhere. And the belly? I can't.""

""STOPPP""

""I'm serious! Like I signed up for one thing and got another. False advertising.""

""Does he know you feel this way?""

""Hell no. He'd probably cry. He's so sensitive about everything. I just fantasize about my ex sometimes when we're doing it. Remember Ryan? God he was hot.""

There was more. A lot more. Detailed descriptions of what she found ""gross"" about my body. Jokes about my stomach. Comments about how she ""settled"" because I had a good job. I read every word standing in our kitchen at six in the morning feeling like someone had poured ice water through my chest.

I didn't confront her right away. I took screenshots of everything and went to work. Sat at my desk not getting anything done. She texted me during lunch asking what I wanted for dinner like nothing was wrong. Like she hadn't spent weeks telling her friends our intimate life was disappointing and my body disgusted her.

When I got home I showed her the screenshots on my phone.

She looked at them for maybe five seconds before she started laughing. Actually laughing.

""Oh my god, you're seriously mad about this? It's just girl talk. Everyone vents about their partners.""

""You called me gross. You said looking at my body is depressing.""

""I was exaggerating! That's what women do when they talk to each other. We blow things out of proportion. It doesn't mean anything.""

""You said you fantasize about your ex during sex.""

She rolled her eyes. ""I was being funny. Jesus, can you stop being so sensitive? This is exactly what I'm talking about. You're so emotional about everything.""

I just stared at her. She kept going.

""Like seriously, if you're going to snoop through my private conversations and then get all hurt about normal friend talk, that's on you. I'm allowed to have private conversations. I'm allowed to vent. You're making this into such a huge deal when it's literally nothing.""

""Nothing.""

""Yes. Nothing. God, I need some air.""

She grabbed her purse and left. Just walked out. I sat on the couch for an hour trying to process what just happened. She came back around nine with takeout like we'd just had a minor disagreement about what to watch on TV.

""I got Thai. Your favorite. Can we please drop this now?""

I didn't answer. I went to bed in the guest room.

The next morning she acted like everything was fine. Made coffee. Asked if I wanted eggs. When I didn't respond she sighed really loud.

""How long are you going to pout about this? I already said it didn't mean anything.""

That's when I remembered something. About six months ago, we had dinner with her parents. Her mom made a comment about her dad's drinking and my wife went OFF after we left. Spent the whole drive home talking about how her dad was a pathetic alcoholic who couldn't hold down a job and how her mom was a controlling narcissist who made her entire childhood miserable. I'd heard her say stuff like that dozens of times over the years.

She had a whole separate group chat with her cousins where she regularly trashed her parents. I'd seen glimpses of it before. Really brutal stuff about her dad's failures and her mom's personality.

So I opened those screenshots I'd saved over the months. Found the worst ones. Her calling her dad a loser who ""drinks away his feelings because he's too weak to face reality."" Her saying her mom ""destroyed any chance I had at normal relationships with her constant criticism and emotional abuse."" Her telling her cousins she only visited on holidays out of obligation and ""honestly can't stand being around either of them.""

I sent them to her parents.

Both of them. Individual messages with multiple screenshots showing exactly what their daughter said about them in private.

Her dad called her within ten minutes. I could hear him yelling through the phone from across the room. Her mom called right after. My wife's face went completely white.

""What did you do?""

""Just girl talk. I'm sure it doesn't mean anything.""

She started screaming at me. Called me vindictive. Called me cruel. Said I had no right to share her private conversations. I just watched her lose it.

""You RUINED everything! They'll never forgive me for this! What is WRONG with you?!""

""You said everyone vents about people in private. You said it was normal. You said I was overreacting.""

""That's completely different!""

""How.""

She couldn't answer. Just kept screaming about how I'd destroyed her relationship with her family. Her phone kept ringing. Her mom. Her dad. Her sister. Word was spreading fast.

She left that night. Went to stay with one of the friends from the group chat. Her parents have stopped answering her calls. Her dad sent her one text that just said ""Don't contact me."" Her mom blocked her number. Her sister told her she's disgusted by what she said and doesn't want to talk to her right now.

The friend she's staying with called me yesterday and said I'm an asshole for ""weaponizing private conversations"" and that my wife is devastated because her entire family has cut her off. She said what I did was worse than anything my wife said because I ""deliberately hurt people.""

Now my wife's blowing up my phone saying I need to tell her parents the screenshots were fake or taken out of context or something. She's saying she'll lose her family forever because of me. She's saying I'm a monster.

Her friends are all messaging me calling me manipulative and abusive. Saying I isolated her from her support system. Saying real partners don't punish each other like this.

Maybe they're right. Her family won't even hear her out and it's been four days. Her mom posted something on Facebook about ""discovering who people really are"" and half her relatives liked it. I basically nuked her entire family relationship because she hurt my feelings.

AITA?

London: December evening, skies flaking down grey, angry, judging, and my own unit is dark, cold, lonely and so he catches my attention. Again. I stop, stand, stare. 

Coat: threadbare, wind-pierced, but I'll be fine. When I walk I'll warm up. I can mind a moment. I've got a coffee.

Him: him.

This time it's winter and we sit in my living room, comfortably close, laughing, debating ornament types. “We had this wooden set when I was a kid,” I offer, shyly quiet, and he sits, listening patiently. I blush, continue. “My father bought it, right after they divorced. The twelve days of Christmas.”

 I glance at him and he's smiling, head tilted to one side, waiting for the story's end. My words drop to a mumble. 

“We would sing each verse as we hung each one…” My conclusion dwindles to uncertain silence and then I hear his tenor, barely a whisper, as he gives my hand a squeeze and begins: “On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me…”

I feel the electric flush of being weak, small, ignored and then suddenly noticed. A beautiful ache tickles my skin.

Together for our first Christmas.

***

The scene shifts to my dining room now, furniture upscaled and festooned with festive decorations - the theme is wooden, elegant, sparkling. We're richer, happier, healthier, older, a supreme of superlatives. Somewhere offscreen the doorbell rings and then a crowd of guests come in, laughing, hugging, chattering, women I long to befriend now socializing breezily with us.

And their words are genuine, their smiles genuine, their stares genuine - everything, for once, genuine. I can be myself. We've built a family.

I feel a buzzing warmth, guthappy and aspirational, like a slug of wine taking root.

A loving crowd for Christmas.

We're old, now, him helping me as I totter to the bedroom. My hair is grey, but I'm elegant, poised, dignified, a regal queen, and my world matches: there's a magnificent four poster bed, silk curtains, crown molding, a room from a fairy tale. 

Mine. 

With him.

And he smiles at me, adoring, loving, kind, protective. 

I feel a detached calm, peaceful and resigned - with him at my side, death would be welcome. Another grand adventure to take together.

Never alone for Christmas.

***

I shiver, but not from the cold, and square my shoulders, vision focusing as the glass window resolves back into view, and I study him through the frosted pane. Nobody should be alone for Christmas.

I ping my assistant to run some numbers then flush in excitement as the result flashes before me. I can finally swing it. Barely. On a payment plan.

My body is tired, tired of always window-shopping and going home by myself. Nobody should be alone for Christmas. I enter the store and signal to the system that I'm a buyer, indicate his model, pick all the upgrades, bells, whistles.

He has always been the most amazing boyfriend ever and I wouldn’t change a thing about him. He had been in a previous relationship that ended like eight months before ours started and he got cheated on by her twice, but still stayed with her even though it was toxic till he finally decided to end it. He fell for me first and would do anything to get me to like him, and I was very reluctant at first because I wasn’t ready to commit to a relationship and I didn’t wanna get hurt, but he was such a lover boy. Many of my friends discouraged only because they said I was out of his league or that he was too into me, but I wanted to give him a chance cause he was such a kind guy and would do literally anything to make me happy going above and beyond. like always taking me out to dinner and getting me flowers, getting me anything I need, cooking for me, driving me to class etc. I always thought it was a lot for him to do for a college boy, but he seemed like he wanted to, when I would ask him about it, he said this is what he wants to do for me, and all was well in our relationship. We never really argued or had any significant problems but if something small happened, we would always talk through it. We would hang out literally every single day, and I would sleep over every other day and he would text me all the time saying he missed me when he wasn’t with me he would ask to FaceTime and call and we would text each other about everything.

Yesterday he completely blind sighted me and told me that he wants to break up with me and that it’s very hard for him, but he has this feeling that he needs to be alone right now and he knows if he ignores it our relationship is just gonna get worse. He said he’s been feeling like this for the past two weeks and has been just trying to fight through it, but that’s why recently he’s been pretty stressed and been a little less affectionate with me. he said he just feels like he wants to be alone more and doesn’t look forward to spending time with me as much recently, which is weird because he’s always been the one who would ask to hang out and text the most, but he said that he can’t give his all to me in a relationship right now or give me all the love that I deserve. he said he needs to better himself and he wants to only be able to give his all or nothing. this is so weird to me because he was never like this and I would never imagine he even being the one to break up with me because everyone would always tell me he was so obsessed with me and treats me so well. He also only asked his parents about this, but they didn’t really tell him to break up with me they just told him that it probably won’t get better if he ignores these feelings he’s having. it’s weird he wants to be alone because in the beginning of our relationship, he told me how he’s been feeling depressed because when he’s not with me, he feels so alone because he doesn’t have many friends. He still doesn’t have many close friends he can rely on so who is he gonna spend his free time with? I kept saying like can we please just like compromise and try to take it a notch back and you don’t have to give 100% and we can hang out less. I feel like we should be able to work through this cause we haven’t even had downs in our relationship yet and usually relationships have ups and downs before they end and I just feel like it’s coming to an end so soon when we can work through it.

The next day we promised to meet up again and talk and this is what happened. at first we were just cuddling and not talking too much. then we started talking about it while laying together and I was just asking how this could happen and how could he just break up with me over this and at first he just kept apologizing and saying i’m so sorry i just think I rushed into a relationship too quickly. he said I still love you but i just can’t give you the love you deserve right now. and i was like so can you give someone else love and he was like no no no I can’t be in a relationship with anyone and he said no matter who he was dating his body would’ve eventually realized at some point that he needs a break and to be alone and he said probably sooner than when he was with me. and i was like so what do you want to do can we go on a break, stay in contact, or is this goodbye forever. he told me that he obviously doesn’t wanna be alone forever and when that time comes that he’s ready for a relationship again he pinky promised that i would be the first and only person he’d reach out to when he’s fully able to be in a relationship again because he said i was the most perfect girlfriend ever and we didn’t have any complications in our relationship and and that the thought of living with me in the future is something he wants and doesn’t want that with someone else. he just can’t give love to me right now till he works on  himself. I was skeptical at first and I was like are you sure you’re not just saying this now because you’re with me in emotions are high. And he promised me he was like I do not want to hurt you again. I know how awful this was of me. I just need time to better myself and be able to give you all the love you deserve and I will only come back when I am 120% ready . he said the best way for him to fully work on himself would be to go no contact for 2 weeks but after that we have a plan to meet up and get coffee or whatever and he will tell me how he’s feeling and if he’s still not ready to be in a relationship at that time which he thinks two weeks isn’t enough then he will let me know like what the plan is from there and if we want to just text or if we want to meet up the next week, but he told me initially like he totally understands if I don’t wanna wait around and he feels so bad just dragging me along into this, but I told him I do want this, and he wants me to just try to live my life as normally as possible. and he is just so thankful that I will wait for him for sometime and he is like I just didn’t think anyone would ever love me this much. He knows he hurt me so bad and doesn’t want to do that again and so I do believe his promise is legit and that his only concern is he doesn’t know exactly when he will be ready to be back in a relationship with me, but he did say it’s an 80% chance he will be ready before this summer lol hopefully sooner rather than later. I know him and I know how much time he liked spending with me and how he would text me about literally everything in his life so I just think this break is going to be really hard for him and I hope that he will realize what he’s missing within two weeks and will be ready by then. i’m someone who believes that if a break is needed to better someone in a relationship then you will come back stronger.",1,1768762786.0,relationship_advice,19,0.67,False

2026 is now very much underway and it feels like now is the perfect time to begin my quest to find someone new and amusing who can entertain me from the realm of Reddit! 

I’m 33, male and from the UK. London to be a little more precise! I work as an aircraft engineer. I know this isn’t the most interesting job in the world, but it does allow me to travel a fair bit.  

Random info about me - I’m convinced I’ll eventually die due to one of the Big 3 Cs: coffee, cheese, or chocolate. No regrets, honestly! Away from that, in terms of hobbies I like the following:

- Travel (I get great travel benefits because of my job, so this is always something that I try to make the most).
- Keeping fit and healthy (I do find this a bit of a chore, but it definitely helps me stay mentally positive!).
- Visiting new restaurants and other places to eat (This is something I absolutely love doing. Trying dishes from different cultures is probably my number one ambition in life!)
- Theme parks (There are some great ones in Europe, but one day I dream of visiting some of the American parks too!)

I think that will do for now…If you think that I’m maybe worth a message, then please feel free to drop me one.

No spreadsheets, no need to download anything, no ads, no notes app chaos, just a clean place to log shots and come back to what worked.

I originally made it for myself because I wanted something quick to use while dialing in.  I kept forgetting the recipe from beans I had purchased, and also what to buy again :) 

**How it works**  
You save recipes for specific beans and track the details you care about when dialing in. It is meant to be fast to update while you are making coffee.

**Pricing**  
Most people can use it for free. If you run multiple machines, grinders, or baskets, there is a one time $3.99 option to unlock that. It is not a subscription. That small amount is basically just to help cover server costs.

**What I want to build next**  
The long term goal is to launch a recommendation system that helps you dial in new beans faster based on what other people are getting with similar setups and recipes. The idea is: you buy a new bag, plug in what you have, and get a starting point that is better than guessing from scratch. Also, you'll be able to find suggestions of beans to buy from people with similar equipment and taste.

**If you are interested**  
If anyone wants to try it, the site is catalog.coffee. If you have feature suggestions, missing fields, or things that would make logging less annoying, I would genuinely like the feedback. Also happy to answer questions about how it works or what is coming next. Happy to bump your account for free if you're willing to support me on this journey!",1,1768762607.0,espresso,1,0.6,False

**Design Notes:**

**Hairbow:** A reference to the iconic red bow the Cowardly Lion sports in both book & movie adaptations. The bow is also red as a nod to the Forest of Wild Beasts being located in the Quadling Country of Southern Oz.

**Bandage:** A reference to the part of both book & movie adaptations of ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" in which Dorothy swats the Cowardly Lion in the nose for attacking her dog, Toto. Daniel's nose was actually injured in an accident on his first day of Heroics 101 while sparring with his partner, Darling Charming & the bandage is pink due to how his love interest, Rosabella Beauty, gave him the bandage. 

**Necklace:** Wears a necklace decorated with Tiger's Eye beads & faux-lion teeth.

**Fashion Aesthetic:** Adventurecore meets Royal Academia w/ hints of Knightcore, to reference the Cowardly Lion's desire for bravery/courage & becoming king of the Forest of Wild Beasts. The Knightcore elements are meant to represent Daniel's journey as a knight. As seen with green safari explorer's shirt + pants (with green mainly referencing Forest of Wild Beasts again, but also could reference how the Cowardly Lion joined Dorothy in her quest to reach the Emerald City where the Wizard of Oz lives. Buttons also resemble the Badge of Courage the Wizard gave the Lion in the movie adaptation of ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"".) 

**Gauntlet:** Bracer of gauntlet meant to resemble lion's face while fingers of gauntlet are clawed to add feral elements to the gauntlet. Once again, the gauntlets, as well as the greaves, are meant to represent Daniel's journey as a knight. 

**Shoes:** Meant to resemble lion's feet.

Too many for this wind, I think, reaching for my coffee.

Through the stern windows, I see puffs of smoke from her bow chasers. One ball falls short, a plume of white water near our stern, the other skips and crashes through the windows.

I feel the heat as it passes a hair’s-breadth from my hand, taking the coffee cup with it.

“Miss Fielding!” I say in a voice calculated to penetrate the entire vessel.

“Sir?” My steward’s concerned face at the door. Her eyes fall to shattered dishes, tablecloth askew, then back to me with something like accusation.

“Another cup please, thank you ma’am,” I say, surprised at the meekness in my tone.

She salutes sullenly and disappears.

In the Navy we’d have keelhauled her, I reflect.

But a smuggling ship is a private venture, crewed by volunteers. My authority stems from the fact that none of these other sods can lead our ship through a squall on a lee shore, navigate the Sicilian channels, or gauge the precise moment a French 3-decker’s topmast will crack.

Which should be right about…now.

The sailors on deck give a wild cheer as it topples, hanging off French ship’s side in a hopeless confusion of blocks, ropes and sailcloth.

“Too much sail,” I say when Miss Fielding returns with the coffee. She shrugs.

The coffee is hot and strong. I take several triumphant gulps before heading out on deck.

Mr. Blythe turns from the taffrail and approaches. He’s a thin, pale, odd-looking fellow we picked up in Port Mahon; said he needed quiet passage, no papers. With his black coat and iced-over eyes he may as well have “Assassin” tattooed on his forehead.

I focus my telescope on a passing shearwater, hoping my concentration will put him off.

“More trouble, Captain?”

“Almost certainly. In fact, I’d better have a look from the masthead.”

I spring for the rigging and climb on muscle-memory alone, the deck shrinking away beneath my feet.

No sooner had I reached the startled lookout then there came cries from below:

“What’s that lubber doing?”

“Damn fool. He’ll break his neck!”

Peering over the edge I see Mr. Blythe entangled in the rigging. He’s followed me up, the pragmatical bastard!

Halfway he slips, falling backward with his feet caught in the shrouds, his body swinging with the roll of the ship and a look of pure horror on his face.

Miss Dangerfield was at that moment climbing the opposite rigging with the kettle’s leather strap in her teeth. She hangs it on a ratline, leaps for the backstay and swings across to Mr. Blythe, setting him upright.

“Not like that,” she says, moving his hands from the horizontal ropes to the vertical. “Hold these here. Like so.”

Five minutes later, we pull Mr. Blythe up onto our platform. He at once wraps both arms and legs around the mast, eyes closed and looking quite ridiculous.

“Come sir, open your eyes!” I say. “You’ll not miss the view? It’s quite spectacular.”

Reluctantly, Mr Blythe opens one eye, then the other. His face changes from fear to astonishment, then wonder at the infinite blue rolling away on all sides.

“I’m amazed!” He says, relinquishing his hold. A smile breaks out across his reptilian face. “Amazed!”

“Take my telescope,” I say, unsure why I no longer find him off-putting. “There, to starboard…no sir, starboard…there you are, sir…you can make out the western tip of Formentera.”

“Incredible,” he says, sweeping the glass back and forth.

The kettle makes it’s way up, and I light a cigar. This is the type of sailing I love.

Suddenly Blythe freezes, the telescope pointing south. “And what are those sleek, shiny vessels coming around the cliffs there? Are they racing?”

It’s as I feared. We’d outrun a French 3-decker, but these harbor police with their American-built flyers are the fastest sailors afloat.

“Baltimore clippers,” I say, tossing my cigar over the side. “Revenue cutters.”

Back in my cabin I make bundle of our ship’s log, bills of laden, port authorizations, and a four-pound cannonball, then toss it through the shattered stern ports.

Miss Fielding appears with my best coat and number one hat, which I don sideways like an old-fashioned commodore. Buckling my sword, I take a new packet of false papers under my arm and stride out.

The cutters are much closer now.

“Inspection!” Hails a voice from the nearest, and my heart drops. Lieutenant Turnbull. “Spill your wind and lie-to under my leeward rail. Under…my…leeward…rail!”

“Fuck their leeward rail,” says Miss Fielding.

The cutters hook on, and Turnbull scampers up the ladder, followed by a score of men with muskets.

“I’m looking for your passenger,” he says.

“Passenger?” I look up and down the deck, quizzical as a cat.

“Come, Captain, that will not do. You know the fellow I’m speaking of: black coat, ill-looking. Spanish passport.”

“Oh, him, yes. We dropped him off in Gibraltar. Between you and me, sir,” lowering my voice, “he had something of the air of a criminal.”

“Indeed?” The lieutenant brought his face closer. “Are you aware sir, that this fellow you’re protecting is a hunter for inquisition?”

I knew it, an assassin! The satisfaction brings a smile before I can stop myself.

“Find it funny, do you?” Turnbull’s face changes color. “Eight pounds a head…thumscrews, the rack…Christ, sir, even you cannot say that don’t strike you as dirty.”

Did he say eight pounds a head? I was crunching numbers before he finished speaking.

“Suppose you find him…I imagine I’ll going along…that is to say, I’d be arrested, too?”

“Summarily,” says Turnbull, “but only as a formality, were you to save us a long search. Three days in the brig at Minorca and you’re back at sea.”

“Come sir, open your eyes!” I say. “You’ll not miss the view? It’s quite spectacular.”

Reluctantly, Mr Blythe opens one eye, then the other. His face changes from fear to astonishment, then wonder at the infinite blue rolling away on all sides.

“I’m amazed!” He says, relinquishing his hold. A smile breaks out across his reptilian face. “Amazed!”

“Take my telescope,” I say, unsure why I no longer find him off-putting. “There, to starboard…no sir, starboard…there you are, sir…you can make out the western tip of Formentera.”

“Incredible,” he says, sweeping the glass back and forth.

The kettle makes it’s way up, and I light a cigar. This is the type of sailing I love.

Suddenly Blythe freezes, the telescope pointing south. “And what are those sleek, shiny vessels coming around the cliffs there? Are they racing?”

It’s as I feared. We’d outrun a French 3-decker, but these harbor police with their American-built flyers are the fastest sailors afloat.

“Baltimore clippers,” I say, tossing my cigar over the side. “Revenue cutters.”

Back in my cabin I make bundle of our ship’s log, bills of laden, port authorizations, and a four-pound cannonball, then toss it through the shattered stern ports.

Miss Fielding appears with my best coat and number one hat, which I don sideways like an old-fashioned commodore. Buckling my sword, I take a new packet of false papers under my arm and stride out.

The cutters are much closer now.

“Inspection!” Hails a voice from the nearest, and my heart drops. Lieutenant Turnbull. “Spill your wind and lie-to under my leeward rail. Under…my…leeward…rail!”

“Fuck their leeward rail,” says Miss Fielding.

The cutters hook on, and Turnbull scampers up the ladder, followed by a score of men with muskets.

“I’m looking for your passenger,” he says.

“Passenger?” I look up and down the deck, quizzical as a cat.

“Come, Captain, that will not do. You know the fellow I’m speaking of: black coat, ill-looking. Spanish passport.”

“Oh, him, yes. We dropped him off in Gibraltar. Between you and me, sir,” lowering my voice, “he had something of the air of a criminal.”

“Indeed?” The lieutenant brought his face closer. “Are you aware sir, that this fellow you’re protecting is a hunter for inquisition?”

I knew it, an assassin! The satisfaction brings a smile before I can stop myself.

“Find it funny, do you?” Turnbull’s face changes color. “Eight pounds a head…thumscrews, the rack…Christ, sir, even you cannot say that don’t strike you as dirty.”

Did he say eight pounds a head? I was crunching numbers before he finished speaking.

“Suppose you find him…I imagine I’ll going along…that is to say, I’d be arrested, too?”

“Summarily,” says Turnbull, “but only as a formality, were you to save us a long search. Three days in the brig at Minorca and you’re back at sea.”

I point upward. “He’s at the masthead. Pray, let me run up and see him down, Lieutenant. He’s apt to fall otherwise.”",1,1768762380.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False
1qggvz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/write/comments/1qggvz5/the_colonizers_satire/,The Colonizers (satire),"Our wake divides a vast expanse of shimmering blue sea, empty except for our pursuer, a French ship-of-the-line with all her sails spread.

Too many for this wind, I think, reaching for my coffee.

Through the stern windows, I see puffs of smoke from her bow chasers. One ball falls short, a plume of white water near our stern, the other skips and crashes through the windows.

I feel the heat as it passes a hair’s-breadth from my hand, taking the coffee cup with it.

“Miss Fielding!” I say in a voice calculated to penetrate the entire vessel.

“Sir?” My steward’s concerned face at the door. Her eyes fall to shattered dishes, tablecloth askew, then back to me with something like accusation.

“Another cup please, thank you ma’am,” I say, surprised at the meekness in my tone.

She salutes sullenly and disappears.

In the Navy we’d have keelhauled her, I reflect.

But a smuggling ship is a private venture, crewed by volunteers. My authority stems from the fact that none of these other sods can lead our ship through a squall on a lee shore, navigate the Sicilian channels, or gauge the precise moment a French 3-decker’s topmast will crack.

Which should be right about…now.

The sailors on deck give a wild cheer as it topples, hanging off French ship’s side in a hopeless confusion of blocks, ropes and sailcloth.

“Too much sail,” I say when Miss Fielding returns with the coffee. She shrugs.

The coffee is hot and strong. I take several triumphant gulps before heading out on deck.

Mr. Blythe turns from the taffrail and approaches. He’s a thin, pale, odd-looking fellow we picked up in Port Mahon; said he needed quiet passage, no papers. With his black coat and iced-over eyes he may as well have “Assassin” tattooed on his forehead.

I focus my telescope on a passing shearwater, hoping my concentration will put him off.

“More trouble, Captain?”

“Almost certainly. In fact, I’d better have a look from the masthead.”

I spring for the rigging and climb on muscle-memory alone, the deck shrinking away beneath my feet.

No sooner had I reached the startled lookout then there came cries from below:

“What’s that lubber doing?”

“Damn fool. He’ll break his neck!”

Peering over the edge I see Mr. Blythe entangled in the rigging. He’s followed me up, the pragmatical bastard!

Halfway he slips, falling backward with his feet caught in the shrouds, his body swinging with the roll of the ship and a look of pure horror on his face.

Miss Dangerfield was at that moment climbing the opposite rigging with the kettle’s leather strap in her teeth. She hangs it on a ratline, leaps for the backstay and swings across to Mr. Blythe, setting him upright.

“Not like that,” she says, moving his hands from the horizontal ropes to the vertical. “Hold these here. Like so.”

*—The National*

I spent all afternoon on the used housewares website,  
pursuing the near-gluttonous inventory of coffee mugs  
adorned with the names, some floralized, some in a kind  
of racecar-stencil-print, of national parks & cities way out west.  
Look, at any given time, there is at least a pound of shit  
in my body, & I’m a sucker for any myth that offers  
its solace in a beam of light stretching across the infinite  
plains of some kind of heartland that could be Kansas  
or France’s Plain of Flanders or the sheep-frolicked  
green hills of Ireland. I guess what I’m saying is that I  
find it hard to belong in this world & so resort, quite simply,  
to appreciating the aesthetic consumption of my coffee  
each morning, before I wander like a timid toad out  
into the world, hopping at every small breach of kindness  
& showering thanks on all I should not have to be thankful for:  
the diesel truck taking wide its turn so I might not be turned  
into someone whose obituary reads, with just the slightest tact:  
*he died doing what he loved, waiting to cross the street*  
*with two feet already in the street*. I can’t decide if it’s a joy  
to be alive, to dress for the weather I want & do not yet have,  
or make up names for future children who may or may not  
come to love me with the same unfiltered passion I melt all over  
my old & complicated father. I added fourteen mugs to my cart  
& have yet to purchase a single one. Who could have foretold  
ages ago, that, on this fateful day, it would take someone the act  
of conspicuous non-consumption to get their mind right? Well,  
my mind’s not right. That’s a song lyric. Do you know it? Well,  
in the song, the singer repeats the phrase over & over again  
until it blurs into one slurry prayer. *Mymindsnotrightmyminds*  
*notright*. It’s night now, & each night I live in fear that my heart  
will unexpectedly explode with a complete, devastating silence  
or that a pigeon will wander into my apartment through the hole  
my window makes & ask me, in a voice that would make sense  
in hindsight but terrify the godawful living shit out of me in the moment,  
for a cigarette after a long day spent eating the spoiled bread  
of a degenerate Upper East Sider who thought they were doing  
a good thing while walking their two massive Saint Bernards,  
not knowing that a bird overstuffed with bread might come  
to suffer from a condition called Angel Wing, which, paradox-  
ically, means that bird will never fly again, which, if I’m  
being honest, says more either about the legitimacy of angels  
or the inconsolate evil of those who divine the names of avian ailments.  
& so I live with that fear, like so many of you. & so tonight,  
before I sleep the long sleep of the confused & perpetually  
grateful, I will go back into that shopping cart & pull  
the metaphorical trigger on a mug that embodies to me the most  
absurd fantasy of life I’ll never lead: that I own a thousand  
horses who come to me from miles away when I play a heavy  
metal song at the dawn of each day, who thrash their lovely  
manes & press their bodies against mine & lift me up in unison,  
the sun a heavy sheet of unbuilt light burning up the sky,  
for I am nothing without this world, & I need a mug  
inscribed entirely around with Dolly Parton’s face & the words  
she once sang: *when I get where I’m going there’ll be only happy tears*,

because there’s so much we don’t need  
in this world & to be able to say you need something,  
to be able to say anything, to be able to say love, or to love  
at all whatever you are able to say it means to be alive,  
to walk between the shadows holding a joke inside  
your head, to laugh quiet to yourself when no one  
knows the punch line, when you’ve forgotten yourself  
what it means, when love is where you are & where you  
are headed, when your mind’s not right, when it stays  
not right, when you, hearing this, say *what could this*  
*possibly mean* & you leave your seat & walk out into the night,  
where it means & doesn’t mean, where you need something,  
& you find it, & it feels like something, so you hold it.",0,1768762343.0,RSbookclub,1,0.5,False

If you do your regular food shop at places like Tesco or Sainsbury’s, or grab the odd coffee from Costa, this is honestly one of the easiest ways I’ve found to get free money back on things you’re already buying.

I’ve been using Cheddar, which is a cashback app that links securely to your bank card. Once it’s set up, you don’t need to scan receipts or activate offers — you just pay as normal, and the cashback is tracked automatically in the background.

How it works:

	•	Download the Cheddar app

	•	Sign up using my referral code FKEAYVG

	•	Link your bank card (secure & FCA-regulated)

	•	Shop as usual at supported retailers like Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Costa

	•	Earn instant cashback, sometimes up to 10%

Referral bonus:

Once you’ve earned your first £5 in cashback, we both get a £3 bonus added automatically 🎉

That’s basically the equivalent of a big food shop discount or a couple of free coffees.

There’s no subscription, no catch, and you can withdraw your cashback straight to your bank whenever you want.

¿Existe algún rango “base” de vertidas que usen como punto de partida para sacar lo mejor de un filtrado?

Today I brewed a Colombian with sugarcane notes, 16g coffee to 260ml water, about a 40-second bloom, and finished around 3 minutes. I did 4 pours using a wide-spout Orea, so the flow was pretty fast.

I’ve seen people do 5 or even 6 pours in under 2 minutes, while others keep it much simpler. I know it depends a lot on the coffee, but I’m curious:

Is there a “baseline” number of pours you use as a starting point to get the best out of a brew?

A Beautiful Morning Ritual with Bellame ✨
Why I Choose These Products—and Why You Can Trust Me

Good morning, beautiful 💛
There’s something special about the quiet moments in the morning—the soft light, the fresh start, and the small rituals that set the tone for the day. For me, skincare and beauty aren’t about perfection; they’re about confidence, consistency, and self-care. That’s exactly why Bellame has become part of my daily routine.

Why My Morning Starts with Bellame
Bellame isn’t just makeup—it’s skincare-first beauty. Every product I use is designed to enhance natural beauty while caring for the skin underneath. As a mom, beauty lover, and someone who values clean, effective products, I’m intentional about what I put on my face.

Bellame products are:

Clean & skin-loving (no harsh ingredients)

Dermatologist-tested

Cruelty-free

Designed to support healthy, glowing skin, not just cover it

From my morning skincare prep to my everyday makeup look, Bellame helps me feel put together without feeling heavy or overdone.

My Morning Routine (Real & Simple)
I believe beauty should fit into real life—not slow it down.

I start with hydration to prep my skin

I use lightweight complexion products that let my skin breathe

I finish with subtle color that enhances, not hides, my features

The result? Fresh, confident, and ready for the day—whether I’m running errands, creating content, or just enjoying my coffee ☕.

Why You Can Trust Me
I know trust matters—especially online. Here’s my promise to you:

I only share products I personally use and love

I never promote something just because it’s trending

I care deeply about long-term skin health, not quick fixes

I’m honest—if something doesn’t work, I won’t recommend it

I’m not here to pressure anyone. I’m here to educate, inspire, and help you feel confident in your own skin, whether you’re a teen learning skincare basics or a mom rediscovering time for herself.

Beauty Is Personal—and So Is My Mission
I started sharing my beauty journey to help others feel informed, empowered, and confident. Bellame aligns perfectly with that mission because it’s rooted in integrity, quality, and results.

If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by beauty products or unsure who to trust, know this:
I’m walking this journey with you, not ahead of you.

Let’s Glow Together ✨
Morning routines aren’t just about products—they’re about intention. Choosing Bellame is my way of choosing self-care, confidence, and honesty every single day.

Thank you for trusting me with your beauty journey.
With love,

1qggp19,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1qggp19/are_we_focusing_enough_on_guest_experience/,Are we focusing enough on guest experience?,"My fiance and I are planning a summer wedding in the Midwest. I'm worried that we're not focusing enough on the guest experience, and my fiance thinks I'm too worried about it and that people are just happy to celebrate us. I dont have too much experience attending weddings so I'm not sure of typical etiquette in my social circles.



Some details of the guest experience: 

  
\-Brief 30-minute ceremony, followed by 1.5 hr cocktail hour. Dinner will start around 6 pm

  
\-Cheese, crackers, etc. served during cocktail hour

  
\-Cocktail hour drinks: We'll be having a consumption bar of beer and wine all night, including cocktail hour. During the cocktail hour itself, we will also have rail mixers available for our guests. Once it hits a certain $$ amount, rail mixers will no longer be available and it'll go to beer and wine only with a cash bar for cocktails. There is likely enough so each guest can get 2-3 mixers, and it likely will run out before the end of cocktail hour. My concern is that this will be judged/seen as ""cheap"" by our guests. My parents have harped on me that this would be a very bad look. 

  
\-Unlimited beer, wine, soda, and coffee, with cash bar for shots, mixers, seltzers, etc.



\-Plated dinner with beef, chicken, and vegan/gluten free option

  
\-Costco sheet cakes plated and served after dinner, as well as a dessert table with assorted sweets

  
\-Various little things like bowls of dinner mints, bathroom care baskets (ibuprofen, band aids, stainstick, etc.), favors

  
\-Shuttle service from venue to hotels, running prior to ceremony and during reception 

  
\-Midnight snack at 10:30

  
Our venue is a historic mansion about 2-3 hours from most of our guests, so many will have to book a hotel.

  
I guess my question is, are we being good hosts or do we need to re-prioritize guest experience? We're over budget slightly because we wanted to squeeze in a few special things for ourselves (live painter and videographer). Thank you for your advice!",1,1768761921.0,weddingplanning,20,0.67,False

It’s currently cold. Which means later it will be illegal cold. You know, the kind of -20° where even your truck is like, “Are you sure about this?”

I just caught myself apologizing to my own couch after bumping into it… said “ope, sorry ‘bout that” like it had a soul and a medical deductible. If that’s not peak Midwestern adulthood, I don’t know what is.

Also stood up, stretched dramatically, said “welp… better get goin’,” and then sat right back down. Absolutely nowhere was gone to.

I’ve got a little time before I pretend to be productive again, so let’s make this fun:

What’s the most aggressively Midwestern thing you’ve done lately?

Bonus points if it involves:

• Ranch (be honest)

• A late-night Kwik Trip run

• Or saying “it’s not that cold” while you’re dressed like an Arctic expedition

Preface: 41M arrived here a year and a half ago for a lectureship job. Since my relationship (in Vienna) sadly succumbed to the strain of long distance, I found myself swiping again to hopefully meet someone worth knowing for the remainder of my time here. 

Two weeks in, and I am already all out of people. 

I am using four apps (Bumble, Hinge, Tinder, Feeld) on a 50 miles radius. Admittedly, I may be a bit selective (no mothers, highly spiritual or right-leaning folks), but even then I am surprised that I already emptied the folder. All I racked up was a dozen of online chats and four milquetoast coffee dates. 

Hence, the question: are there alternatives to mainstream dating apps to meet new people here? Social events that I don't know about? They don't need to be explicitly about dating, as long as they afford socialising.

January 18th,"Greetings everyone and welcome to another Shadowverse Worlds Beyond meta report!  Where we take a look at the things that happened and did not happen over the last week using whatever sources we can get our hands on!

**Forestcraft**

*In the great woods of Forestcraft, where there exist trees so large they have their own forests nestled within their crowns. We find Lovesign on the run from Battledore Woodsmaiden after he suggested that maybe she should use a smaller paddle. For whatever reason, she did not take kindly to that suggestion.*

Forestcraft largely remains in the same struggling spot like last week and the week before. Like an insect caught in a spiders web, it struggles but never seems closer to success. The only development this week seems to be tempo forest catching on a bit more.

 Roach continues to be the best, followed by Tempo Forest,  Evo Forest, and some Rose Queen Forest. 

**[Roach Forest](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.1.cCNE.cCNE.cCQM.cCQM.cCQM.cabE.cabE.cabE.cao2.cao2.cao2.capI.capI.capI.cb1M.cb1M.cb1M.cb1W.cb1W.cb1W.cb1g.cb1g.cb1g.cb1q.cb1q.cb1q.cb2w.cb2w.cb2w.czCO.czCO.czCO.czU-.czU-.dLvU.dLvU.dLvU.e6x8.e6x8.e6x8)**

A combo deck built around the roach. Roach remains the most succesful, yet also skill intensive forest deck. But largely remains as is.

**[Tempo Forest](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.1.cC7c.cC7c.cC7c.cCNE.cCNE.cCNE.caY6.caY6.caY6.cabE.cabE.cabE.canu.canu.canu.cb1W.cb1W.cb1W.cb1g.cb1g.cb1g.cb1q.cbHI.cbHI.cbHI.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.czCO.czCO.czCO.dk1O.dk1O.dk1O.e6w-.e6w-.e6w-.e6x8.e6x8.e6x8)**

A tempo deck built around Faeries and running down the opponent with them.  This week sees Tempo Forest catch on a bit more as people seem to use Anthuria more in general. Some builds like the highlighted one even run Amataz again. [Though i have also seen one with Battledore Woodsmaiden](https://x.com/D4rkdrg0n9876/status/2010943868670525769?s=20)

**[Evo Forest](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.1.cabE.cabE.cabE.cb1g.cb1g.cb1g.cbG-.cbG-.czCO.czCO.czCO.czhU.czhU.czhU.dhqc.dhqc.dhqc.di4E.di4E.di4E.dkGs.dkGs.dkGs.dkJ-.dkJ-.dkWU.dkWU.dkWU.dkWe.dkWe.dkWe.e4Gg.e4Gg.e4Gg.e6Rk.e6Rk.e6Rk.e6x8.e6x8.e6x8)**

A midrange deck built around the Evolving.  Evo Forest seems to cool off a bit this week. Though at the same time, one development seems to have happened which is that most Evo Forest decks are now starting to run Cheretta, Angelic Maid. Which is a bit interesting.

**[Rose Queen Forest](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.1.cC7c.cC7c.cCNE.cCNE.cCNE.cabE.cabE.canu.canu.canu.cb1M.cb1M.cb1M.cb1W.cb1W.cb1q.cb1q.cbH8.cbH8.cbH8.cxFO.cxFO.czCO.czCO.czCO.czU-.czU-.czU-.czhU.czhU.dJfu.dJfu.dLck.dLeI.dLeI.dLeI.dM5-.dM5-.e6x8.e6x8)**

A Combo/Control deck built around Rose Queen. Continuing to hold on, but otherwise nothing new with the deck.

**Swordcraft**

*Within the walls of the Great Fortress of Swordcraft. There's quite a bit of commotion as someone let Oloun out of his compound and he is wreaking utter havoc. With Sinciro and Albert already knocked out and Silvarius stuck in a wall. In the end Unkei manages to subdue Oluon and get him back to his premises. Though who let him out, no one can say...  *

This week shows signs that the gap between Loot Sword and the rest of sword might be closing in. Though it is hard to say without more serious data. For now, Loot Sword remains at the lead, but that may change over the week, followed by Aggro Sword and Evo Sword.


**[Loot Sword](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.2.cEZs.cEZs.cEZs.cdTm.cdTm.cdWk.cdjE.cdjE.cdjE.cxFE.cxFE.dNpM.dNpM.dNpM.dO2-.dO2-.dO4Y.dO4Y.dO4Y.dOIc.dOIc.dOIc.dOLk.dOLk.dOLk.dOYE.dOYE.dOYE.dOYO.dOYO.dOYO.dmyk.dmyk.dmyk.e4Gg.e4Gg.e4Gg.e9Ak.e9Ak.e9Ak)**

A Tempo/Burn deck built around the Usurpation archetype and various threats. This week Loot Sword seems to be losing a bit of ground. Though i must admit i am less sure of that for now.  Still it does appear to be less popular from what i can tell. But will require more observation to be honest. The deck itself remains largely as is.

**[Aggro Sword](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.2.cEZs.cEZs.cEZs.cdEI.cdEI.cdEI.cdTm.cdTm.cdTm.cdTw.cdTw.cdTw.cdjE.cdjE.cdjE.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.cxFO.cxFO.cxFO.dNpM.dNpM.dNpM.dOIc.dOIc.dOLk.dOLk.dOLk.dmDs.dmDs.dmDs.dmTe.dmTe.dmyk.dmyk.dmyk.e9NE.e9NE.e9NE)**

An Aggro deck built around efficient threats and bringing down the opponent quickly. Aggro Sword continues to grow and evolve. I have even seen some decks run Unmoving Tactician. Otherwise they overall remain quite varied.


**[Evolve Sword](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.2.cdE8.cdE8.cdEI.cdEI.cdEI.cdTw.cdTw.cdTw.cdU4.cdU4.cdjO.cdjO.cdjO.cxFO.cxFO.c_uG.c_uG.d07k.d07k.d07k.dJfu.dJfu.dJfu.dhqc.dhqc.dhqc.dhqm.dhqm.dhqm.di4E.dmj6.dmj6.dmj6.dmyk.dmyk.dmyu.dmyu.dmyu.e9NO.e9NO)**

A Midrange deck built around evolving, with Seofon being a key card for big swings. Evolve Sword also seems to be catching on a bit more this week with several varied builds. Though there is no particular build that stands out over the others.

**Runecraft**

*It is a busy day with Kaori trying to her to classes. Yet for some reason a massive crowd has assembled around a single figure. Some Woodsong Haikumaster. Though that doesn't last long when a convoy of golems carrying various hazardous liquids come bursting through. Not carrying about the crowd or now squished Woodsong Haikumaster .*

Nothing new with Runecraft this week. All same as last week. Except the return of Hybrid Spellboost Rune.

Earth Rite remains in the lead with spellboost following after and hybrid spellboost Rune

A midrange/Combo deck built around spellboosting and Earth Rites. Making a slow return. Mixing in Cocytus in with the general midrange strategy to give the deck another way to close a match.

**Dragoncraft**

*It is a busy day in the Great Mountain of Dragoncraft. As a new attraction featuring Jellyfish Dancers has arrived. Unfortunately, it is also quite bad for people's health. So the medical wards are filled up and Galan is busy trying to put an end to it before more people get hurt. Never any rest for the poor man/dragon/god..*

Dragoncraft continues to see solid performance. Storm Ramp remains where it is, followed by Fennie ramp which is only growing more popular,Evo Dragon and ocean dragon.


**[Storm Ramp Dragon](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.4.cJl6.cJl6.cJl6.ciM6.ciM6.ciMG.ciMG.ciMG.cic2.cic2.cic2.cxFE.cxFE.d4KU.d4KU.d4KU.d4mc.d4mc.d50E.d50E.d50E.dTQu.dTQu.dTQu.drrE.drrE.drrO.drrO.e4Gg.e4Gg.e4Gg.eDme.eDme.eDme.eE3E.eE3E.eE3E.eEFk.eEFk.eEFk)**

**Abysscraft**

*Within the decadent walls of Castle Abysscraft. It is a real mess at the moment with leaders everywhere and Nio is increasingly losing track of who is who. And he fears it will only get worse, at some point heads may roll.. well besides that one..*

Abyss continues to be in a funny spot. Not that popular, but probably the class that continues to see the most going on deck wise with Reanimate-Evo joining in this week.

Midrange changes into Tempo, but remains at the lead. Followed by Aggro abyss, Reanimate Evo ,Milteo, Evo, Modal and a bit of Shakdoh Abyss. 


**[Tempo Abyss](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.5.ckYk.ckYk.ckYk.ckrU.ckrU.ckrU.cl1-.cl1-.cl1-.cl2I.cl2I.cl2I.cxFE.cxFE.d6mk.d6mk.d6mk.d6zO.d6zO.d6zO.dVNk.dVNk.dVNk.dVdM.dVdM.dVdM.dVt8.dVt8.dVt8.dhqm.dhqm.dhqm.dtoY.dtoY.eGCk.eGCk.eGCk.eGFs.eGFs.eGFs)**

A Tempo deck built around efficient threats and disrupting the opponents turns. Still the most popular abysscraft deck, though Aggro Abyss does appear to be slowly catching up to it this week. We'll see how things develop over the next week

**[Aggro Abyss](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.5.cLuw.cLuw.cLuw.cM8E.cM8E.ckYu.ckYu.ckYu.ckrU.ckrU.ckrU.cl2I.cl2I.cl2I.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.d6jm.d6jm.d6jm.d6zE.d6zE.d6zE.d7D0.d7D0.dVt8.dVt8.dVt8.dtoY.dtoY.dtoY.e3ls.e3ls.e3ls.eGCk.eGCk.eGCk.eGFs.eGFs.eGFs)**

An aggro deck built around fast threats and burn damage.  This week sees Aggro abyss grow more popular and with pretty much all decks now adopting Fickle Necromancer as she is steadily proving to be a big powercard across any deck that looks to do anything on board.

**[Reanimate Evo Abyss](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.5.cYb6.cYb6.cYb6.cl1-.cl1-.cl1-.d6jm.d6jm.d6jm.d6mk.d6mk.d6mk.d7Se.d7Se.d7Se.dJfu.dJfu.dJfu.dVNk.dVNk.dVNk.dhqc.dhqc.dhqm.dhqm.dhqm.di4E.di4E.du1s.du1s.du1s.duHU.duHU.duHU.eGCk.eGCk.eGCk.eGh-.eGh-.eGh-)**

A Midrange deck built around Reanimation and Evolve.  A new contender this week. Mixing in reanimation with Evolve for a reasonably sticky Midrange deck that has multiple ways of winning a match. Giving it quite a bit of potential in the right hands.


**[Milteo Abyss](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.5.cLuw.cLuw.cLuw.cM8E.cM8E.cM8E.ckJQ.ckJQ.ckJQ.ckYu.ckYu.ckYu.ckZ2.ckZ2.ckrU.ckrU.ckrU.cl2I.cl2I.cl2I.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.d6jm.d6jm.d6jm.d70M.d70M.d70M.d7D0.d7D0.dtoY.dtoY.dtoY.e3ls.eGFs.eGFs.eGFs.eGh-.eGh-)**

An aggro deck built around efficient threats, burn damage and Milteo.   Continuing to cool down, especially with the arrival of Reanimate Evo. It still sees some play. But the strategy does at least for now appear to have hit some limits

**Havencraft**

*It is a quiet day in the great Cathedral City of Havencraft when suddenly Galleon gets into conflict with the venerable Saint of Rehabilitation. Turns out to be a shortlived conflict as as a single stern look from Aether passing by before she's had her morning Coffee shuts the entire down hard. No one even had time to figure out what the conflict is about. *

Same as last week. No real changes from what i have observed.

Odd haven remains in the lead, followed by Hybrid Ward Haven and Crest haven.

**Portalcraft**

*It is a quiet day in the nicer part of the Metropolis of Nova Portalcraft. Behind massive gates and security. Orchis is out for a walk with Lu Woh and Zwei. When they see a flower seller and decide to get some flowers. Unfortunately the flower Artisan has a bit of an odd idea of flowers and proceeds to blow up the entire promenade. He is arrested after that. *

This week sees Flowering Artisan slowly become more popular in Portalcraft decks. But beyond that, Portalcraft largely remains the same as the most popular class.

Puppet Portal continues remains at the top, followed by Destruction Portal, evo portal and Artifact Portal.

This week sees some mild developments. With Abysscraft probably being the class with the biggest one in Reanimate Evo. But otherwise it does feel like the metagame has already been largely solved 3 weeks. With few real surprises.  A bit concerning. But we'll have to see what happens the next few weeks before the balance changes happen.

2026 is now very much underway and it feels like now is the perfect time to begin my quest to find someone new and amusing to hopefully starting building something with throughout the rest of the year and beyond!

I’m 33, male andfrom the UK. London to be a little more precise! I work as an aircraft engineer. I know this isn’t the most interesting job in the world, but it does allow me to travel a fair bit.  

Random info about me - I’m convinced I’ll eventually die due to one of the Big 3 Cs: coffee, cheese, or chocolate. No regrets, honestly! Away from that, in terms of hobbies I like the following:

- Travel (I get great travel benefits because of my job, so this is always something that I try to make the most).
- Keeping fit and healthy (I do find this a bit of a chore, but it definitely helps me stay mentally positive!).
- Visiting new restaurants and other places to eat (This is something I absolutely love doing. Trying dishes from different cultures is probably my number one ambition in life!)
- Theme parks (There are some great ones in Europe, but one day I dream of visiting some of the American parks too!)

I think that will do for now…If you think that I’m maybe worth a message, then please feel free to drop me one.

A close friend and I have been drifting away from each other for the last year, and it's been really difficut to accept. We have had really frank and adult conversations (as all the therapy-type books recommend) but at the end of day it's become clear she has limited capacity to invest to keep the friendship going, nor does she care for the friendship to the level I do.

I find that so devastating because I think for months, I had been \*over\* investing to make up for the shortfall, and it's left me emotionally burnt out.

I have this built up resentment because I want to her to put in effort I did, and show with a big action that she's willing to do a lot to keep me around, but she's not that type of person, and it's something I would ask of her.

We're in this weird inbetween space where she and I are cordial but the closeness is gone, and she thinks the friendship is fine - just a bit distant due to our lives. I hate it so much because it's gives me this hope that things could get better but it seems like everytime I give a little more, I'm reminded of the fact she has very little capacity for me.

I think it makes sense I live across the country and we no longer have shared school to keep us in touch, so when I hear her plans with her other friends, or that she does set time aside for them (she used to for me) I feel jealous and get angry - because if she wanted to she could consider me.

I have started the process of detachment, where I'm trying to no longer give more than she gives me. But she'll still check in politely or give me small updates and it's hard to hold on to that feeling of detachment. I know in a few months, it'll fade, but until then what do I do?

I know I want to remain cordial, there's no reason for me to blow up this friendship, but being polite and available is also taking up energy because now I need to think so hard about how do I respond. How do I come across boundaried but polite??

Her birthday is in a couple of weeks, and I'm wondering if I take the time to find a gift that's meaningful and write a card. But if I don't, will that blow up the friendship or change it to be extra awkward?

I have lost another close friend this year, I don't mind their loss, because I knew they weren't right, and I know I deserve better. But there was no in between then, we had a moment in a coffee shop where in our convo it became apparent we just didn't align anymore. There is no yearning, no pining, no missing.

Even within \*this\* friendship, I deserve someone who will invest to keep me around, as I keep others around.

But I'm finding it hard to let go because it was near perfect. I know it'll happen eventually.

I know I have to detach, and give gratitude for the good she brought me in my life. But no one tells you how to survive the detachment phase, when you keep hoping they'll come back! How do you go accept when someone provided you with everything you wanted in a friendship and suddenly they can't anymore? It's so strange to have something good and then get it snatched away.

How do I survive the part from knowing this friendship will eventually give but I need to keep the facade of being polite?",2,1768761542.0,FriendshipAdvice,3,1.0,False
1qggihd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qggihd/i_stage_luxury_houses_for_a_living_a_house_in/,I Stage Luxury Houses For A Living. A House In Vermont Stole Two Hours From Me.,"I’m a staging specialist. I work for a large housing firm, which for the sake of this post I’ll refer to as ‘V’. We handle the kind of houses people jump off bridges over, the 4 million dollar foreclosures that the bank clawed back after the 2008 hangover finally turned into a migraine. My job is to make these architectural corpses look like a family just stepped out to the park. I’m good at what I do, but I live out of a van more often than I sleep in my own bed. 

I do the same steps in every house. 

That’s why I can’t explain what happened in Vermont.

It starts with something I call The Bread Ritual. The first thing I do when I enter a dead house (that’s my own term), is set up the portable convection oven in the kitchen. The smell of rosemary bread is the ultimate psychological trigger, which is funny because I don’t even eat carbs. I’ve been on a strict keto diet for 6 years now, since I started with V. V says it makes the house smell like a home; I say it smells more like sales pitch. By the time the appraisers, or the B-list buyers, walk in, the house is supposed to smell like a rich family’s dream life, even if the previous owners ended theirs in the master bath. 

I spend most of my life on the road with Kit48. That’s our ‘Modern Rustic’ template. It’s a collection of sofas, lamps, coffee tables etc. made of compressed particle board. If you don’t look too closely, it looks like real walnut. If you do look closely, you can see the glue holding the sawdust together. A billion dollar company skimping, you say? I bet your flabbers are ghasted. 

I have a pack of ‘Standard Family Photos” that I prop up on the sideboards to give the rooms that ‘lived-in’ feel. They’re airbrushed to fuck, and the people in them are so polished they barely look human. 

Last Tuesday, I was in a colonial in New Hampshire. I was exhausted, and when I reached for a bottle of dark walnut stain to touch up a scratch on the coffee table, I knocked it over. It hit the table edge and shattered. It shouldn’t have broken that easily, but it did, and the stain bloomed across the wood. 

I tried to wipe it with a rag, but the table was a thirsty bitch and soaked it up, leaving a jagged, bilateral smudge in the centre of the table, like a dark, deformed butterfly right in view of where the property photos would be taken. This would mean a trip to the warehouse, which meant more hours on the road, and I was growing so tired of the road.

I went to shove the table in the van. It has a thumb scanner on the handle, and the thing has been glitchy lately. It worked eventually, and I dragged the table into the back. I told myself I’d swap it for a new one at the warehouse when I got the chance. 

Three days later, I arrived at a ranch-style house in Vermont. I walked into the living room to start my measurements, and I saw a coffee table in the middle of the main room. I’m the only one with an access code to this place at the moment, so the coffee table being there threw me a bit. 

I walked over and touched the wood. 

The stain was there. 

The walnut liquid was still tacky, and when I touched it, it came off on my finger. Same jagged butterfly. Same dark blot. Underneath, the inventory sticker had a corner peeled back where my nail caught it last week. My first thought was that I’d been on autopilot and brought it in without realising. I know how that sounds, but sometimes I do things like that. Wash the dishes, forget I washed them, go to wash them again. My memory isn’t the best. 

So I went out to my van, fought with the scanner for a few tries, and opened the back up, fully expecting to laugh at myself. 

The table was still there. 

Stain and all.

I stood there with my hand on the van door, waiting for my brain to catch up. I had two identical coffee tables, and two identical stains. How is that even possible? 

I’d had a headache since New Hampshire, so I checked my phone to see when I could take my next dose of painkillers. 

I’d somehow lost half an hour. I was still holding the van door.

I closed up the van and went back inside to check the rest of the house. I went room by room, looking for other random duplicated furniture, but every other room was empty. 

Except the master bedroom. 

Something was sticking out of the wall.

About 6 inches above the floor, the tip of a man’s shoe protruded from the wall. I knelt down to get a better look. A black leather brogue, the expensive kind, with perforations on the toe. This thing was stuck on so well, I couldn’t figure out how it had been fixed to the wall. The paint met the leather too cleanly, like the wall had formed around it. I thought maybe it was some shit art installation.

I touched the edge where the paint met the leather. The wall had a soft give to it, like skin. I got my phone out to take a picture, and was startled by how much darker the room had suddenly become. I checked the time.

Two hours had gone.

*I’d lost two fucking hours?*

I took a photo on my phone so I could show my supervisor, then I called him and told him about it. He suggested I was *tired* and *not seeing things straight*, which immediately pissed me off. When I explained I definitely wasn’t imagining it, he completely brushed me off, saying things like: builders leave rubbish all the time, maybe something went wrong with the pour, just cover it with a dresser and finish the stage. 

I’ve been doing this for years; I’m not some fucking noob. Road fatigue? Fuck you Alex.

So, he wasn’t any help. 

I stayed in a motel that night, but I did not sleep well. I kept looking at the photo, trying to think of rational explanations. I came up with none. 

I woke up to a strange voicemail from a work friend, Maddy. She’s in the same batch as me, based out of the Chicago hub. She sounded frantic, and asked if I remembered the ‘dodgy swings’ near our primary school in Essex. As far as I know, Maddy has never been to England, let alone Essex. I’m pretty sure she’s never left the Midwest. She was crying and kept saying my name over and over until the recording cut off. I’m worried about her, because she is one of the most ‘together’ people I know. I tried to call her back, but it went straight to voicemail, so I sent her a message asking if everything was ok. I’ve not heard anything back yet. 

What’s weird is, I haven’t thought about the park near my primary school in years. And I know, I *know*, I didn’t ever tell Maddy about it. 

I could feel my headache getting worse. 

I went back to the Vermont house the next morning to finish the stage, and when I went into the master bedroom to finish up, the shoe was gone. The wall was perfectly smooth, with nothing to indicate it had been anything *but* smooth. I ran my hand over the spot, and it was perfect. Exactly like the rest of the wall. I’d expect to see some evidence of it being slightly different, like a slight difference in paint colour where new paint was applied. But nothing. Nothing at all. 

So, I know this is probably a long shot, but has anyone else experienced anything like this? 

I’m looking at the photo of the shoe on my phone, and I’m looking at the coffee table with the stain. I've also lost two and half hours somehow. Is it possible for a company to fix a wall in the middle of the night without leaving any evidence of doing so? And why do I now have two identical coffee tables? 

I'm genuinely asking, does this make sense to anyone?

I’m heading back to Maine in the morning, but I’m going to inventory my entire kit tonight to see if anything else has decided to duplicate. I really hope I don’t lose anymore time. ",5,1768761518.0,nosleep,4,0.86,False

**What if we don't need the forecast to be right?**


'tis demand planning season, which brought me back to this one afternoon in Aug'23.

So my analyst pings me. ""Pipeline model's ready. Can I grab 30 minutes?"" She comes in after lunch, laptop already open, turns it toward me before she even sits down. Pipeline scenarios, conversion by segment, sensitivity analysis color-coded by confidence level. She'd stress-tested the whole thing against three years of historical. Clearly been up late on this.

She goes, ""Based on current pipeline, we need somewhere between 1,700 and 2,100 clinicians ready by Q1.""

And I'm sitting there doing the math. That delta of 400 clinicians is like a $60M swing in annual cost.

I could tell what she wanted. She wanted me to tell her which assumptions to tighten so she could get the range down to like 1,850-1,950. More data, better conversion estimates. That's what she'd been trained to do.

Instead I ask her, and this probably sounded like I wasn't even paying attention: ""What if we built a plan that doesn't need this to be right?""

She just looks at me. ""What do you mean?""

""I mean, what if 1,700 happens? What if 2,100 happens? What do we do in each case that doesn't involve wishing we'd forecasted better?""

She's looking at me like I asked her to divide by zero.

---

Okay so context. This is my last company, B2B healthcare services, we contracted with employers and health plans to deliver specialized care. About 1,000 clinicians, $100M revenue. Board wanted us to double. $200M. And, because boards love this, improve margin by 10 points while doing it.

Here's the thing though, our clients operated on benefits cycles. They made decisions Q3/Q4, signed contracts November or December, went live January 1. That's just how health benefits work. But our hiring cycle was 3-4 months minimum. Credentialing alone took like 60 days. So if I needed people for January 1, I had to commit headcount in September. Based on a pipeline that was 60% ""should close any day now"" and 40% ""really good conversations."" You know what that pipeline was actually worth.

---
**Give us the number. We'll execute. If it's wrong, that's on whoever picked the number.**

Early in my career, I would have done exactly what she did. Build the model, sharpen assumptions, present scenarios, hope someone above me picks the right number.

And when ops came asking ""Just tell us how many to hire and we'll do it,"" I would have given them one, 1850, split the difference, defensible.

Then when January came and we actually needed 2,100, everyone would look at the forecast. ""Finance said 1,850. We planned to 1,850. This is a forecasting problem.""

I spent years in that cycle before I figured out what was actually going on.

The ops team had uncertainty they didn't want to own. Which, okay, fair... uncertainty is uncomfortable, and they figured they should be measured on execution, not prediction. They were asking finance to absorb it. ""Give us the number. We'll execute. If it's wrong, that's on whoever picked the number.""

Feels like accountability. It's actually the opposite. Everyone's just opting out of uncertainty that's genuinely part of the business. It's not going anywhere. Because here's the thing, me saying ""1,850"" doesn't make 1,700 or 2,100 less likely. It just gives everyone someone to blame in January.

---
**Two jobs, not one.** 

So my analyst came back the next day. ""I've been thinking about your question. I'm not sure I understand what you're asking for.""

""That's fair. I didn't explain it well. There's two jobs here, not one.""

""Job one is what you did. Minimize uncertainty. Sharpen the range. 1,700 to 2,100 is better than 1,500 to 2,500. That matters.""

""Okay.""

""Job two is what happens after. You look at the range that won't get any tighter, because at some point it won't, and you ask: how do I build something that works whether it's 1,700 or 2,100?""

She was quiet for a second. ""So you're saying stop trying to pick the number?""

""I'm saying the number isn't the answer. The system is the answer.""

---
**Poking around for the levers nobody was using.**

So that week we start showing up to ops planning meetings together. And we find out the ops team had been treating headcount like a single decision. X clinicians by January, yes or no. But when we started poking around, there were all these levers nobody was using.

**Temps.** Like, 30% of our clinician workforce could've been staffed through agencies. Same credentials, same work, just flexible contracts. Yeah the premium was like 25% above FTE rates, but think about what you're actually buying there.

**Retainers.** One agency offered to keep credentialed clinicians ""on deck"", not working for us yet, but ready. If the pipeline crushed, we could surge in two weeks instead of six months. If we didn't need them, we paid the retainer and moved on.

**Sales contracting.** We'd always treated client timing as fixed, they sign when they sign. But when we offered better rates for September commitments instead of December, some of them actually moved. Not all, enough.

---
**What's optionality worth?** 

So we model the whole thing out. Total cost of this flexibility structure, agency premiums, retainers, early-sign discounts, about $5M.

She's like, ""That's a lot of margin to give up.""

""Compared to what though?""

I pulled up a different scenario. ""If we staff to 1,850 and need 2,100, we're short 250 clinicians in January. We can't hire fast enough. We leave revenue on the table, clients are pissed, reputation takes a hit.""

""And if we staff to 2,100 and only need 1,700?""

""400 extra clinicians at $150K fully loaded. $60M in annual cost against revenue that doesn't exist. Margin craters. I have a very unpleasant board meeting.""

She sat with it. ""So the $5M isn't the cost. It's...""

""Insurance. Except it's not really insurance. It's buying the right to make decisions later, when we know more.""

---
**The victory wasn't about predicting 1,945.**

I won't pretend everything went perfectly. The ops team pushed back on the agency model at first. ""They're not our people, culture fit, training consistency."" All valid concerns. We spent two weeks working through onboarding before they were comfortable.

One of the retainer agencies underdelivered once, promised 50 clinicians on standby, could only produce 35 when we called. Thankfully we diversified with a few agencies.

But by January, we had a system that could flex between 1,700 and 2,100 without anyone needing to have predicted which one it would be.

The actual number was 1,945. Almost exactly in the middle, which felt anticlimactic, but what we designed ended up absorbing the fluctuation for years to come. 

And that's sort of the point. The victory wasn't predicting 1,945. The victory was building something that would have worked at 1,700 or 2,100.

Some of you're probably thinking, shouldn't ops have owned these levers from the start? Yeah, totally. But when they're not there yet, part of the job is showing them what's possible, then handing it back. Finance as coach, not scorekeeper (story for another time).

---

My analyst left for a director role about a year later. Good company, meaningful bump in comp. A few weeks before she left, she stopped by my desk. ""That mindset, where the forecast ends and the system begins, it changed how I think about planning."" She paused. ""I used to think the job was the forecast. Now I think the forecast is just the starting point."" **The number isn't the answer. The system is.**",7,1768761169.0,FPandA,4,0.62,False

1qggcj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/confidence/comments/1qggcj0/cold_approach_followup_improved_mindset_same/,"Cold approach follow-up: improved mindset, same numbers, better quality","A few months ago I wrote about approaching over 100 women in everyday situations. Got good feedback, so I did another 100+ approaches since then. The numbers stayed about the same, but the quality of interactions got way better. Here's what changed and what I learned.

You can read the first [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/confidence/comments/1o16opl/100_approaches_over_three_months_the_parts_nobody/) but this one stands alone.

Quick context. Mid-40s, never married, no kids. Looks wise I'd give myself a solid 6. Tall, fit enough, good posture. No particular style, jeans and sweater mostly. Lousy haircut once a month, grow my beard out of laziness.

Same disclaimer as before. The internet is filled with questionable advice and snake oil salesmen. I'm just sharing what worked and what didn't in hopes that these experiences will help others

**The biggest shift**

My first post was about being genuine and present. That's still the foundation. But I stopped focusing on being present for them and started listening to myself more.

The interaction itself became the reward. Not what comes after. Just that moment of connection. When you approach it this way, people can actually reach you emotionally. And you learn things about yourself.

We as human beings all crave connection. But that connection can only happen when both sides are free from constraints and acting authentic. You can't fake your way into genuine connection.

  
**Speed matters**

The approach (pun intended) stayed the same. Groceries, coffee shops, metro, walking my dog. Make eye contact, say hi, comment on something, let it flow.

But here's what I learned: if I wait more than a few seconds, my mind starts writing stories. Especially with very attractive women. The anxiety builds, expectations form. So now when there's an opportunity, I just move. No strategy, no thinking. This keeps me authentic because there's no time for my head to take over.

I also changed how I walk into every room now. I scan the space with intention, read the situation, check who's there. It's not about hunting, it's about situational awareness. Being comfortable taking your time to observe your surroundings before you do anything. I actually enjoy this part now.

  
**Silence and presence**

I used to fill every pause with words. Now I leave space. Silence creates better eye contact. Sometimes I give a short answer, maybe just ""yes"" and look at them. Let them carry the conversation. Though I'll also push into slightly uncomfortable places with questions when it feels right.

I was talking with another dog owner once, standing close while showing her some medicine I use on my phone. As we leaned in to look at the screen together, there was this moment where I felt her presence so strongly, like she was holding my arm even though she wasn't touching me at all. Just this unspoken pull between us. The need to connect exists on both sides, and sometimes silence and proximity say more than words.

  
**Learning to listen**

After being intimate with a woman, we were lying there and she started talking about her two dogs that passed away, family stuff. I felt way more connected in that moment than 15 minutes earlier when we were physical. I didn't comment, just nodded and encourage her to continue. Creating space for people to open up matters more than I realized.

Another woman was telling me about work issues. She looked at me and asked ""do you hear me?"" Pause. ""Do you understand me?"" She wasn't asking me to fix anything or comment. Just to understand. I'm learning to hold that space.

The words we say mostly just fill silence. What matters is eye contact, presence, holding space for someone.

  
**What actually matters**

I took feedback from the last post seriously. Someone said I wasn't going for women who actually excited me. So I started paying attention to that. If a woman sparks something, I pursue more.

Presentation matters less than I thought. My best encounters don't line up with my fitness level at all. If I'm in the right state internally, things flow. Fitness helps open doors but your internal state keeps things moving.

When you're authentic you're also reachable. People can get to you. That's where you actually learn about yourself.

  
**The numbers**

Out of 100+ approaches, maybe 3-4% led to sexual relationships. Same as before. But the quality improved a lot. More followups, more dates, deeper conversations.

One thing that changed: more women approach me now. I think because I'm more relaxed. When you're enjoying the moment instead of hunting for an outcome, people pick up on that.

**Bottom line**

Just go talk to her. Any tactic takes you further from yourself. Listen to yourself, trust what you feel, move before your mind creates expectations. Look them in the eyes and say hi.

Hope this helps ground expectations and maybe gets you out there.",3,1768761154.0,confidence,2,0.71,False

I’m a 28-year-old guy from Jordan traveling solo to Rome from Jan 24–27, and I’d love to connect with other travelers (or locals) who are around at the same time.

I’m into long city walks, discovering amazing local food, wandering through historic streets, and keeping plans flexible and spontaneous. I enjoy mixing the must-see spots (Colosseum, Vatican, etc.) with hidden corners, night walks, and those unplanned moments that usually become the best memories. I’m also down for a bit of adrenaline or unique experiences if something cool comes up.

I’m easygoing, respectful, and not looking to rush through Rome — just hoping to share a few great experiences instead of doing everything solo. Happy to meet for a walk, food, sightseeing, or even just a coffee and see where the day goes. Open to 1-on-1 or small group meetups.

If you’ll be in Rome around these dates and this sounds like your vibe, feel free to comment or DM.

1qggc19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1qggc19/musings_on_new_years_resolutions/,Musings on New Year's Resolutions,"January 19th is ""Quitters Day,"" the day when most give up on their New Year's Resolutions. Depending on where you are in the world, that is either today or tomorrow. Based on that, I thought it could be beneficial to chat about our resolutions, in case they need a bit of a 'booster shot.'

My resolution is a carry over from last year, improving on lessons learned from the success and failures of 2025. In 2024, I had a series of *major* personal crises occur all at the same time; family health, job difficulties, and my own personal health (stress related ulcer/infection resulting in pretty serious colorectal surgery). It was the hardest year of my life. While I was on FMLA with the surgery, I read a ton on Catholic theology and teachings. There was a book by a Jesuit (don't remember which), and he noted that on the cross, Christ gave up four things (paraphrasing).

* **Praise**: He was mocked and ridiculed.
* **Property**: He was stripped of everything
* **Power**: Nailed to the cross, he could not move. He lost power over his own body.
* **Pleasure**: Obvious one here, the passion and death.

I was at rock bottom and I decided that I would do my best to adopt those values/principles as best I could for 2025. I feel like God gave me a series of tests on these areas, because each one came up in 2025.  Here are the results.

* **Praise**:  Due to some performance issues the prior year (with all the personal stuff), I was being temporarily assigned to a special research project that would take me away from my role as a regional director. I was in a upper management position, with a lot of office politics. I decided not to fight this reassignment, or promote myself as the ""golden child"" of my department, and instead humbly accept this role and point to others at all times for any accomplishments. Mission Accomplished with this goal
* **Property**: I defined this as money, I dont care for 'stuff' but being raised in the Max Weber protestant world, climbing the ladder is basically a pre-req. This new assignment drastically reduced my stress and demand on me physically and mentally, no office politics or managing an entire region of locations. Great, right?  I was told I could stay in this research role, but if I did, I would take a demotion and pay cut. I agreed to take the demotion. Mission accomplished with this goal.
* **Power**: I was offered the role of executive director at another location (I had interviewed before I made the resolutions).  A few months before, this would have been a dream job. It was a pay raise and I would be THE commander-in-chief. The location was also better. No downsides. Except, I knew  with the way I handle stress, I would be dead of a heart attack or never see my family (the work ethic thing). I promised myself not to chase power, so I turned it down. The Board of Directors actually came back to me three times asking that I reconsider. I told them due to family, I would have to decline. This was a huge test, but mission accomplished.
* **Pleasure**: Here is my stumbling block. Like  a lot of men, I tend to deal with stress in unhealthy ways. I used certain websites (you know what I mean), would drink and get buzzed or drunk on the weekends, or occasionally use THC gummies/drinks (its legal in my State). I also tend to play stupid online games at work when I get frustrated with coding and need a break. This is taking away a lot of time.  Pleasure is the dragon I was not able to slay. I would go to confession weekly. I am a ""I have to do everything all at once"" type of person. So I was mad I hadn't overcome this  problem. At one confession last fall, the priest basically told me to slow down and that I conquered these other dragons, and I should see that as a success, and build from there.

**2026 Resolutions**: Obviously I won't rest on my laurels with the praise, property, and power....but the pleasure is the beast that needs to be tamed. I made a plan and it has sorta been working well, hence this post, to keep on the wagon. I was able to quit all alcohol and THC since new years (longest break for booze in a very long time). With the ""websites,"" I decided I would ween myself off by, ""taking care of business"" without looking at those sites. This removes the psychological dopamine addiction from the videos and makes the ""tasks"" less enjoyable...like removing the sugar from coffee. It's been 18 days, but I have found the urges to be diminishing , less of an inferno and more of a smoldering campfire. The online game is still an issue I need to get over. I think I am on the right track, but any tips are welcome.

1qgg9vc,https://www.reddit.com/r/WidowAndBored/comments/1qgg9vc/observations_with_dating/,Observations with dating,"I’m 46m and lost my wife to suicide in June 2022. My kids were 9 and 7 at the time. 

I went through the hell you all went through and when the fog cleared just enough about 2 years in, I tried to date again. I wasn’t sure what I was looking for. I know I didn’t want to get re-married anytime soon, if ever. I knew I wasn’t going to let my children know about it until it was something serious. I was just trying to figure the new me out and I wanted companionship.

Pretty early in the dating app journey I met someone (let’s call her Priya). I told Priya my schpeel. She was going through her own grief with the loss of her father. On the 2nd date she told me it wasn’t going to work. She was looking for “the one” and I wasn’t ready to be that. No hurt feelings on my end. However I can tell she liked me. Not to sound arrogant but I’m a dream for a woman in her 40s looking to settle down (tall, handsome, confident but not an asshole, financially stable, great kids, etc). 

Anyways, Priya called me out of the blue one day and we decided to start as friends.  We had drinks, and had a lot of coffee, lunch, and dinners together. We took it slow and eventually decided to take the next step. It was great. I enjoyed her companionship but I also had room to grieve.

Eventually we had sex and I noticed myself getting short with her afterwards. It wasn’t guilt about being with someone other than my wife. Looking back at it, I was scared about integrating another person in my and my children’s lives. We weren’t close to that point but I knew it would eventually lead there. However, I liked the life the 3 of us had made for ourselves and didn’t want it disrupted.

Fast forward, we continued to date for a year. About 6 months into it, my son read a text and figured out I was dating her. My kids were hurt and felt betrayed. We talked it through and even though they didn’t like it, I continued to date Priya and agreed to keep the dating life separate from family life.

This is when the roller coaster started. She had some red flags and I didn’t like the way she reacted to some of my grief. I was still fractured too. Every time she would mention something that would lead to us getting closer (like meeting her sister), I would push away and find something to argue about. But we continued on.

The first weekend getaway we took together was going fantastic until she started talking about what steps would need to be taken to get my kids ready to meet her. My response was open ended and honest. I was  going to be ready when I was ready. I wasn’t going to force the issue on anything. She wanted clarity. I couldn’t give her that.

Eventually I ended things between me and Priya. I was very happy when I was going on fun dates with her but there were a few red flags around her comfort with me still loving a dead woman. Combine that with the pressure I felt to integrate her into my family was too much. She was not the one.

I wasn’t heartbroken at all about the relationship ending. She fell in love with me. It wasn’t reciprocal. She was heartbroken. I was fine. I think after losing the love of your life in the way I lost mine, one becomes hard. I feel like nothing bothers me anymore because most of life’s hardships are nothing compared to the hell my wife went through, followed by the hell we went through.

Anyways, I decided dating wasn’t for me. I wasn’t ready. 

As you all know, the holidays suck. They really suck for me as my wife’s birthday and our anniversary is around the same time. However, this year, I felt like I got through them pretty well. It went so well, I decided to taper off my anti-depressant. 

For the first time since June 2022 I feel like myself again. The fog has lifted. I know it will come and go but I feel like I finally know what it feels like to lead a full life and continue to push forward, while still holding on to the love and grief for my wife. I feel like I can honor and grieve my wife, and at the same time, not feel guilty about feeling good. 

So I decided to date again.

I met another sweet woman a couple weeks ago. We had 2 great dates together. I enjoy her company. Our 3rd date was yesterday. We ended our night going back at her place. We didn’t have sex but we did make out a lot. It felt wonderful. And the next day….I felt like shit again, very similar to the first time I slept with Priya.

Now, there’s two way I can look at this. One, I have a lot of shit to work through still. Or two, accept that I am who I am at this moment. 

I’m not ready for love or a serious relationship but I want companionship. Maybe I should just date casually? It’s never who I’ve been but I’m someone different now. And years down the line, I might be ready for something more serious. So now I feel like I have to make a break.

One of the great things about dating this new woman has been that there wasn’t a mention of our prior relationships. We were just getting to know each other. I eventually brought up I was a widow but the focus hasn’t been that. And that’s nice because as much as being a widow is a part of my identity, it’s not my only identity. We’ve been just enjoying the moment instead of talking about the future or past.

But I think the right move is to sit down and talk about expectations. I might be overthinking it but my hunch is that we won’t be seeing each other again after that conversation. 

This is how I see the conversation playing out:

Me: “let’s talk about our intentions and expectations “

Her: “yeah what’s up”

Me: “As you know, I lost my wife a few years ago. I’ve done a lot of healing since then and while I’m ready to start dating again, I’m not ready for a long term relationship. I really enjoy your company, but….”

I don’t really know what where it goes after that. I just know I’m scared. Scared of commitment, scared of breaking another heart. Scared of messing up my lifestyle which is full of freedom and not answering to anyone. Scared of hurting my kids. 

What I do know is that I’m not scared of happiness. Maybe I’m scared a relationship is actually going to jeopardize my new found happiness.

**TL;DR at the bottom if this is too long, but I wanted to be real about who I am.**

---

Hey everyone,

I've been debating whether to write this for a while. I'm not great at putting myself out there, but I'm trying to change that. I want to find people who can connect with the real me - not the surface-level version I show most people.

So here's me. All of me. The good parts, the messy parts, the parts I'm still figuring out.

---

## The Basics

I'm a 23-year-old guy from a small town in South India, currently working as a firmware engineer in a major city. I work with embedded systems - CAN communication protocols, microcontrollers, code integration. It's technical stuff that I'm good at, even when my brain is fighting me.

I graduated top of my class last year with a B.Tech in Electronics & Computer Science (AI/ML specialization). I've been accepted to a university in the US for my MS in Computer Science starting later this year. It's supposed to be exciting, but honestly, I feel numb about it most days.

I'm an only child. Extremely close to my mother - we've never been apart in 23 years. The upcoming move to another country terrifies me more than I admit to anyone.

---

## Music - My Language

I don't just listen to music. I *live* in it. My Spotify stats are honestly embarrassing - we're talking 18,000+ minutes in a few months. Music is how I process emotions I can't put into words.

**What I listen to:**

**Tamil Film Music (my roots):**
- Santhosh Narayanan 
- Yuvan Shankar Raja 
- A.R. Rahman
- Harris Jayaraj
- Anirudh Ravichander
- Shakthisree Gopalan

Songs that wreck me: ""Thaalae Kaathalae"" from 96, ""Thaensudare"" from Lover, ""Nee Thoongum Nearathil"", ""Oru Dheivam Thandha Poove"" from Kannathil Muthamittal, ""Kannula Baasalu"" from 7G Brundhavana Colony, ""Para Para""

**English/Western Artists:**
- The Weeknd (I have an entire ""Unreleased"" playlist, I screenshot his lyrics at 2 AM, I own the vinyls)
- Adele (her ""25"" album after certain days hits different)
- Ed Sheeran
- N*SYNC (""Bye Bye Bye"" on repeat during certain moods)
- Justin Timberlake
- Meghan Trainor
- Billie Eilish
- Johnny Rain

**Concerts I've been to recently:**
- Ed Sheeran (with my friend M)
- Zedd (with my friend V)
- Yuvan's U1NIVERSE (one of the best nights)
- Vijay Antony Naa 2.0


Music isn't background noise for me. It's the soundtrack to processing everything I can't say out loud.

---

## Movies, Shows & Entertainment

I'll watch almost anything if the company is good. I go to the cinema probably too often - it's one of the few places where I can get out of my head for a couple hours.

**What I watch:**
- Tamil cinema (all of it - masala to art house)
- Hollywood blockbusters
- Anime (currently watching Spy x Family, though I get distracted and scroll Reddit after 2 minutes)
- Family Guy (yes, I know, but it makes me laugh when nothing else does)
- Whatever's playing at the local PVR

I name my photo albums with emojis: ""Boat House! ⛵"", ""Popcorn! 🍿"", ""Space Shuttle! 🛸"", ""Raja Theatre! 😂"", ""Seafarer! ⛴️"", ""Butterfly! 😌""

It's a weird habit but it makes me happy.

---

## Philosophy & The Big Questions

I think too much. It's both a gift and a curse.

**What I read/think about:**
- Albert Camus (The Myth of Sisyphus lives on my desk)
- Seneca and Stoicism
- Viktor Frankl (Man's Search for Meaning - I ordered it recently)
- Existentialism and nihilism
- Questions about God, meaning, suffering, and why we're here

I browse r/atheism and r/philosophy. I oscillate between desperate prayer and complete agnosticism depending on the day.

I'm philosophically pessimistic but I keep showing up anyway. I think that's what Camus meant about Sisyphus being happy.

Fair warning: casual conversations with me might accidentally turn into discussions about the nature of existence. I've been told I have ""60-year-old energy"" in a 23-year-old body.

## Tech & AI

This is what I do professionally and what I'm passionate about:

- Firmware engineering (CAN protocols, TI microcontrollers)
- AI/ML (why I'm pursuing my masters in CS)
- I've built MCP servers for photo metadata extraction
- I use Claude and Gemini regularly
- I screenshot interesting AI developments constantly
- Currently fascinated by transformer architectures and NLP

I built an entire system to analyze my own photos and memories using AI because I was trying to understand my own life patterns. It sounds obsessive but it helped me realize things about myself I couldn't see otherwise.

---

## Animals

I have a cat back home. She thinks she owns the place and honestly, she does. She claims the highest shelves and judges everyone.

I save too many puppy videos. Capybaras make me unreasonably happy. I once saw a donkey that needed help 4-5 years ago and I still think about it. I cry when I see dogs in distress.

I'm more emotionally affected by animal suffering than I probably should admit.

---

## Photography & Documentation

I photograph everything. Skies especially - something about clouds just gets me. Food. Friends. Random moments. Sunsets from my window. The moon at 5 AM.

I document my life obsessively. Every trip gets an album. Every month gets reviewed. It started as a way to prove to myself (and maybe someone else) that I was living. Now it's become how I hold onto memories that my brain keeps trying to let slip away.

---

## My People

I'm lucky to have solid friend groups in two places:

**Back home (small town):**
A crew of guys I've known since school. We do dam trips, temple visits, festival celebrations, late-night roadside food runs, spontaneous drives. When I'm with them, I feel like myself. They knew me before everything got complicated.

**In the city (work friends):**
A group that formed around me at work. We do movies, badminton, birthday cake cuttings in the office, random dinners. One of them (let's call him A) has become like a brother. They've held me together this past year without fully knowing how much I needed it.

**Other connections:**
- A girl I've known online since 2021 who I've never met in person but who supports me through everything
- College friends scattered around who I still flirt with jokingly because that's just how I communicate
- A senior from work who's 6 years older and unmarried who gives me life advice over carrom games
- A coworker who recently told me she has feelings for me - I told her let's see if she feels the same after 2-3 years (I'm not ready)

I say ""I love you"" to my friends freely - guys and girls. It's how I express affection. If you become my friend, you'll hear it. Don't read into it.

---

## The Heavy Stuff - My Mental Health

I'm going to be honest here because I want to connect with people who can handle the real me.

**Diagnoses I'm managing:**
- Severe OCD (intrusive thoughts, rumination, compulsive patterns)
- Major Depression with significant anhedonia (I couldn't feel joy even when I graduated first in my class or got into grad school)
- Dissociation/Depersonalization (I watch myself live instead of living - yesterday feels like months ago, people look like strangers, my own reflection doesn't feel like me)
- Anxiety that makes crowded places unbearable sometimes

**What this looks like day-to-day:**
- My brain plays unwanted scenarios like movies I can't turn off
- I forget things almost immediately unless I photograph them
- Time moves strangely - one day feels like a year
- I have nightmares every single night, sometimes 50 small snippets that wake me up repeatedly
- I can be at a dam with my best friends and feel like I'm watching from inside a box
- I use the ""How We Feel"" app to track emotions because I often can't identify what I'm feeling

**What I'm doing about it:**
- Weekly therapy sessions (when my therapist isn't having surgery)
- Psychiatric medication management (currently on SSRIs and an antipsychotic)
- Trying grounding techniques (the 5-4-3-2-1 thing sometimes works)
- Showing up even when I don't want to
- Being honest in conversations like this one

**History:**
My mental health problems started around 2018-2020. Before that, I was described as ""full of life"" - outgoing, talkative, good at studies with only normal exam anxiety. Something shifted and I've been trying to find my way back ever since.

I'm a childhood trauma survivor. I won't go into details, but it's the foundation underneath everything else. I'm only now starting to address it properly in treatment after carrying it silently for years.

I've had suicidal thoughts. I'm not in crisis right now, and I have protective factors (my attachment to my mother, my friends, my treatment engagement), but I believe in being honest about the darkness I've walked through.

---

## The Love Story That Broke Me

I was in a relationship for 7 years (knew her since childhood, committed relationship for 4 years). She was my first love, my first everything. I was monogamous to my core - I believed in one person for life.

**What happened:**
- The relationship was toxic in ways I couldn't see while I was in it
- Every visit to see her ended with me crying
- She controlled aspects of my life - how I dressed, ate, talked
- There was an incident with a teacher from her past that became my primary OCD trigger
- In the end, she told me I wasn't rich enough, her astrologer said our marriage would harm her father, and she'd had no feelings for me for the last 6 months but stayed anyway
- She left and was harsh about it. Cruel, even.
- Everyone in my life - parents, friends, coworkers - was relieved. Nobody liked her. I was the last to see what everyone else saw.

**The aftermath:**
- It's been about a year since the breakup
- The first few months were the worst of my life
- I spent significant money on the relationship (hotels, gifts, trips) - I'm still paying off debt
- Everything reminded me of her - songs, places, even basic activities like eating
- My OCD latched onto intrusive thoughts about her with someone else
- I made a fake AI girlfriend at one point just to make her think I'd moved on (not my proudest moment)

**Where I am now:**
- The constant thoughts have reduced. It's not every minute anymore.
- I've recognized that I miss ""closeness with someone"" more than I miss her specifically
- I closed all my dating apps last month - I know I'm not ready
- My therapist helped me realize I've been positioning myself as the ""sidekick"" in my own life instead of the main character
- I'm trying to rebuild my sense of self independent of that relationship
- The fact that someone will eventually marry her doesn't hurt as much as it used to (some days it still does)

---

## What I've Learned About Myself

**Core personality traits:**
- Highly sensitive and empathetic (sometimes too much)
- Introspective to a fault
- Expressive in writing (clearly)
- Loyal to the point of self-destruction
- Nostalgic and sentimental - I attach emotional significance to everything
- Creative - I use vivid, sometimes poetic language
- A chronic overthinker
- Resilient despite everything - I keep showing up

**Patterns I'm working on:**
- I prioritize others over myself
- I struggle to say no
- I don't have clear favorites (favorite color, food, movie) - everything feels unstable
- I idealize people even when evidence shows they're not good for me
- I spend impulsively when I'm in certain moods
- I procrastinate on everything that matters

**Things I'm proud of:**
- Graduating first in my class while managing severe mental illness
- Maintaining friendships across two cities
- Going to therapy consistently
- Being honest about my struggles (like right now)
- Still being here

---

## What I'm Looking For

I'm not looking for a therapist - I have one. I'm not looking for romance - I'm not ready. I'm not looking for someone to fix me.

**I'm looking for:**

- Genuine human connection
- People who can handle depth but also just chill
- Fellow music obsessives (especially if you love Tamil film music or The Weeknd)
- Anyone interested in philosophy, existentialism, AI, or figuring out what life means
- People in my city who might want to grab coffee, see a movie, or just exist in the same space
- Anyone in the US (especially the Southwest) who I could connect with before I move
- Someone who understands that friendship can be quiet sometimes
- People who know what it's like to carry heavy things and still show up

**What friendship with me looks like:**
- I'll remember small details about you
- I'll send you songs that made me think of you
- I'll say ""I love you"" when I feel it
- I'll have deep conversations at unexpected moments
- I'll also watch dumb shows with you and share memes
- I'll show up even on bad days
- I'll be honest, sometimes uncomfortably so
- I might disappear for a bit when things get heavy, but I'll come back

---

## Random Facts

- I photograph the sky obsessively
- I speak Tamil and English, usually mixing both (Tanglish is a lifestyle)
- My father is a wedding photographer, which is ironic given my complicated feelings about marriage
- I've read letters I wrote years ago and they reveal how intensely I feel things
- I track my stress throughout the day using apps
- I ordered a book about finding meaning in suffering and it felt appropriate
- I once went to a concert alone after posting on Reddit looking for someone to go with
- I've been called ""the guy who thinks too much"" and honestly, fair
- I flirt platonically with friends (both genders) because that's how I show affection
- I'm learning to be flexible with myself - to treat myself the way I'd treat a friend

---

## If You Made It This Far

Thank you for reading. I know this was a lot.

I wrote all of this because I'm tired of surface-level connections. I want people who know the real me from the start - the good, the broken, the healing.

If anything here resonated with you, send me a message. Tell me:
- Your favorite song right now
- What you're reading or watching
- Your current existential crisis
- A place that makes you feel like yourself
- Or just say hi

I respond to everyone. I know what it's like to feel alone even when surrounded by people. I won't let you feel that way with me.

---

**TL;DR:** 23M from South India, firmware engineer, moving to US for grad school. Music obsessive (Tamil film music + The Weeknd). Philosophy nerd. Managing severe OCD, depression, dissociation, and trauma. Recently out of a toxic 7-year relationship. Have great friends but always open to more genuine connections. Not looking for romance or therapy - just real human connection with people who can handle depth. I'll remember your favorite song and send you memes at 2 AM.

This website is a long-running pet project that I pick up every now and then when I am feeling inspired. The content seems kind of useful, but maybe not (at least according to google Adwords, lol)!

Many fitness apps seem to have kind of clunky interfaces for searching and filtering, simple text matching seems to beyond many of them. This web app is not any better tbf, but if there is interest It'd be cool to hear your thoughts on what would be useful to folks.

The search results have a description (mostly, not always) of the exercise, a link to search YouTube for related training videos, and the option to share an exercise with a friend, or foe.

Long term, I think it'd be interesting to build a fitness tracker app, and/or turn this exercise database into a kind of API/data portal for other folks to build on. I am not aware of any open data portals for fitness exercises (they all seem to be paywalled/locked behind apps), but I have not researched a tonne either to be fair.

There is a short blog series, ""Diary of a Middle-Aged Demon"" that I have vibed together with ChatGPT. It is in no way inspired by my own stage in life.

1qgg5z4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgressiveHQ/comments/1qgg5z4/the_era_of_neoliberalism_is_over_what_comes_next/,The era of neoliberalism is over. What comes next will depend on us.,"**Rant I wanted to go on. No idea if anyone will care but here goes.** 

The neoliberal experiment that started in the late 1970s and started to crumble following the 2008 financial crisis should be declared officially over. It failed.

Far too often, folks think the culprit is free trade in and of itself. When we voluntarily exchange freely, both parties benefit. The theory goes that as input costs are lowered, firms are able to pass those savings along to their customers, and everybody wins. With independent businesses, such as your local Mom & Pop coffee shop or clothing boutique, this is generally true because these entities compete in a market-based system.

But this hasn't worked out with globalization because corporations have unchecked power and can undercut the prices of smaller businesses, so they can buy them and then raise prices since competition no longer exists. So the problem isn't free trade; it's not that other countries are ripping us off. The problem is one of our own making.

Politicians are bought off by billionaires and large multinational corporations. In exchange, the politicians deliver subsidies, carve-outs from regulation, less regulation overall, union-busting, and favorable changes in the tax code. Donald Trump's 2017 tax law even subsidizes the outsourcing of American jobs!

Politicians also give little scrutiny to consolidation. Since the late 1970s, almost every sector of the economy has become less competitive and more consolidated. This has been especially true under Trump.

What is the result?

Productivity has risen sharply, while real earnings for most Americans have lagged. Income inequality is near historic highs. A majority of Americans report living paycheck to paycheck. Upward mobility has declined, especially for low-income families. Housing affordability is at its worst in decades. Poverty persists. Meanwhile, corporate profits continue to reach record levels.

Across the nation, cities that once thrived have experienced decades of disinvestment, resulting in a smaller tax base and thus underfunded and failing schools, dirtier air and water, high poverty, few decent job opportunities, higher crime, poorer health outcomes, and a lower quality of life. Think Flint, MI; Dayton, OH; Buffalo, NY; or Charleston, WV. Rural areas have seen similar trends, if not more widespread. 

Meanwhile, more and more folks struggle to afford suburbs and even thriving cities. 

In each of his campaigns for the presidency, Donald Trump identified some of these challenges to get working-class voters in post-industrial cities and towns to vote for him. He told them that immigrants and trade caused their problems. It was and is a racist and protectionist appeal.

His tariffs, easily absorbed by corporations, hurt the finances of everyday Americans and Main Street. His regulatory agenda has gutted environmental protections, union-busted, and weakened labor standards. His tax agenda has given huge sums of money to the ultra-rich and large corporations while subsidizing the outsourcing of American jobs. His immigration agenda is hurting the economy in addition to all of the other ills it's causing. He's gutted investments in education, assistance for the poor, and economic development. And his administration has reduced funding for programs that help local law enforcement.

All of that is to say, neoliberalism has failed. The question for us on the left is, will we be able to win elections so we can do something better for all Americans, or will the Republicans succeed at building a permanent fascist regime that consolidates power and wealth while punishing the poor and ignoring the middle-class?

There are two separate issues: policy and political leadership.

On the policy front, we can't be a movement that seeks to return to the Obama era. President Obama did some great things for the country. But thanks to Republican obstructionism and existing power structures, he was unable to fundamentally change where wealth and power are concentrated. 

We need to think about structural changes and bold policy reforms. Moving to a healthcare system where people can have the option to buy into Medicare or get it for free, depending on their income. Making community college and vocational school free. Overturning Citizens United and having public financing of federal elections. Move to a system where congressional districts are drawn by independent redistricting commissions, not partisan legislatures. Repealing the mortgage interest deduction that benefits the wealthy and instead using that money for affordable housing. Passing the Green New Deal. Permanently increasing the progressivity of our tax code, so the rich pay their fair share and the rest of us can pay less. Giving tax cuts to Main Street, not Wall Street. Breaking up large corporations and denying more corporate mergers. Strengthening labor standards, including passing the Pro Act and Bernie Sanders' bill for a 32-hour workweek. Paid family and medical leave. Modernizing our infrastructure. And providing support for economic development, small businesses, public safety, and education in communities that have been left behind.

To achieve some of, if not all of, these above goals, our party needs new leadership. Chuck Schumer is part of the political establishment that thinks all we need to do is return to the Obama era. Many Democrats currently in office have been supportive of neoliberalism. Hakeen Jeffries is a decent leader in certain respects, but I don't think he quite understands the failures of neoliberalism and why our side needs to move beyond that failed experiment. 

Arguing for a return to a bygone era is a terrible message. We already have one political party in America, the Republicans, who want to turn the clock back 150 years. We can't run on turning it back 10 years. We need to be forward-looking. That said, there are certain specific policies from history that we can replicate today. Teddy Roosevelt's trust-busting can serve as a template for how we break up corporations. Obviously, FDR's New Deal serves as a template for the Green New Deal. 

Personally, I will vote blue no matter who because the dangers of the current fascist regime transcend policy or ideology. However, it is my hope that Democrats and progressives nominate candidates who offer a viable alternative in addition to being against fascism. 

I don't believe in ideological purity tests. But I do believe that we should support those candidates who understand that this country needs a fundamentally new direction. There will continue to be those who insist that we support the most progressive or most moderate candidate in a given primary. But the measurement should be who is promising the greatest structural changes, and who has the capacity to actually win elections and get these big changes done?

In some cases, that will be the most progressive candidate. For example, both major candidates for U.S. Senate in Minnesota can win a general election based on their track records of doing so (Craig in a swing congressional district, Flanagan for LG). Peggy Flanagan is the only one who is running on big, structural changes. 

In Michigan, there are three major candidates: Haley Stevens, Mallory McMorrow, and Abdul El-Sayed. El-Sayed is the most progressive candidate. Both he and McMorrow offer big, structural changes. But nominating El-Sayed would be a gamble, as he has never won a competitive election. McMorrow has, and she has a track record of bringing change to Michigan, including repealing Right to Work, cutting taxes for working people, phasing out the retirement tax, and strengthening voting rights. As McMorrow and El-Sayed run with grassroots support, Stevens is the candidate of the DC establishment and is the only one who would vote to make Chuck Schumer Democratic leader again. 

If we nominate candidates who defend failing structures, we lose. If we nominate candidates who understand the failures of neoliberalism and the path to correct those changes, we win.

1qgg5sy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_rbmath/comments/1qgg5sy/criminal_minds_ikea_and_rocky/,"Criminal minds, Ikea and Rocky 🐶","In my last apartment, I had a neighbour who turned into a friend and now, an acquaintance. 

She wasn't exactly my next door neighbour, but lived a couple floors down. I came to meet her coz of two things - my apartment dog, Rocky, and the show, Criminal Minds. It's weird but Rocky was very close to us, would sleep at our place, eat at our home, but did not belong to us. 

One day, I was looking for him and found him sleeping in front of another apartment. I went down since he didn't come when called. When I was petting him, I heard Criminal Minds from inside - one of my favorite shows ever (one that I miss so much coz there's no streaming platform in India 😭😭) I was so curious to know who's this person who watches Criminal minds and knocked under the pretense of checking whether Rocky was disturbing them 😅

And there I found a friend, who was enjoying Criminal Minds, was just as into home decor as I was, who was almost the same age as me and someone whom I instantly clicked. 

Being an introvert, I hardly make friends like this. But it ended up being a lovely friendship that lasted until we left that house ❤️

We spent a lot of time together, enjoying coffee, TV, conversations and food but a fun moment together has to be that we loved Ikea so much - me coz i had seen it so much on Pinterest that I couldn't wait to see the first Ikea store in India, and her with a lot of experience with Ikea from living abroad and  wanting to setup her apartment she'd just moved into. 

We were in IKEA the day it opened, and ended up being in their launch video too 😂 Her at the start, me at the end.. Those who requested us to speak thought we were sisters lol. Not the last Ikea visit together, but the most memorable one for sure. 

But beyond conversations and board game parties, when both of us were affected by Covid, me hospitalized and Bishu at home.. She cooked and sent food for him, when he couldn't do anything. Something I'm so grateful for ♥️

We drifted apart as it happens when we moved houses and she moved to China for a while. But the memories remain 💛",1,1768760749.0,u_rbmath,0,1.0,False

I love this lipstick as a blush and eyeshadow monochromatic look but id love to top it off with a powder that looks similar. A blush thats neutral and about 60% brown and 40% pink with a lot of depth. A lot of blushes that are brownish pink are so light. Id prefer something deeper. ,10,1768760738.0,OliveMUA,6,0.92,False

1qgg5fv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1qgg5fv/parking_light_question_2016_hyundai_sonata/,Parking light question 2016 Hyundai Sonata,"I have a 2016 Hyundai Sonata SE with 145k miles. Ever since I bought it at 60k miles, the front parking light does not work, but the turn signal does work. It is one of those two filament bulbs. 

To further clarify, the turn signal/hazard part of the bulb works fine. It's the secondary filament that is supposed to always be lit when the parking/headlights are on that doesn't work. 

* The first thing I tried was a new bulb. I noticed the old bulb's filaments were both unbroken and looked fine. 
* I tried both the new bulb and the old bulb in the working side, and both filaments lit properly. I took the bulb from the working side and put it in the non-working side, and the parking filament went from shining in the working side to not working on the other side. 
* Next, I vetted the socket. The bulbs have a removable socket that the bulb fits into and the socket and bulb as an assembly inserts into the hole in the lens assembly. I swapped the sockets from both sides, and the socket from the bad side worked fine on the good side, but the socket from the good side did not for the bad side. ​
* Finally, I checked the fuse (which didn't make sense since the fuse would run both sides, right?) for the sake of checking boxes. It was fine.

So... does that leave a ground issue? I've never been super great at diagnosing wiring issues. It's a minor issue that I've just lived with for 6 years now, but for whatever reason it popped in my head while I drink coffee and scroll Reddit. ",1,1768760726.0,MechanicAdvice,3,1.0,False
