You can only get these at certain, mainly flagship, stores. This was from George Square in Glasgow.

A bit steep at £5.60 including a coffee but the assistant said I'd get it 50p cheaper if I added wedges. No wedges available but she rang it up as if there were! By Grabthar's hammer, what a saving!

My manager is entrepreneur, she's owns and runs one big fancy restaurant and this small fast casual restaurant but she seriously has temperamental issues. The job is good but I feel like I was lied to, she said it was 15 dollars an hour plus tips, but when I see my information from my paychecks there's no reduction for tips,  and I've done the math and it doesn't make sense. I wanna bring that up and other issues but I'm afraid because she's a very aggressive person. As a person she's lovely, but as a manager she's a nightmare. She has yelled at my co worker until she cried and changed her availability, yelled at my other co worker so bad she dragged him outside near the dumpster to yell at him even more, and has yelled at me to the point I started crying and started dissociating and she got even more angry at me even though she was like yelling at me so much. And at her other restaurant it's the same thing, many employees complain saying how she's scary, aggressive, and just straight up brutal towards you. And supposedly she's like 10x worst at the other fancy restaurant because everyone is like ""she's worst here you wouldn't last a day"". One of the employees over at the fancy restaurant said she took fried and had a mental breakdown because she was so mean to her. And the crazy part is it's like normal to her??? Like it's okay to yell and scream at ppl until the point it's literally harassment??? Her husband works at the restaurant sometimes to help here and there (both restaurants) and he's very well aware of her atrocious personality to point he tells people ""just toughen, your an adult, you're being too sensitive"" to the ppl who have tried to say something abiut her shitty personality. It honestly just feels like abusive relationship, remember when I said as a person she's really good? The reason is because she will buy you snacks or coffee and stuff for you but next fucking minute she's yelling at you and treating you like you're the dumbest person ever. I'm always walking on egg shells when around her, like every time she's in my presence I tense up, and I've think she noticed because last month she asked me if I liked her and I was like ""hahaha yeah, you're really cool"". Like seriously I was saying that cuz I felt so pressured lol. Anyways I just wanted to vent and ask y'all for advice and all. And with the tip thing I want to bring that up also plus her shitty personality but I'm afraid I'm going to get yelled at and it won't even be worth it. Other employees have stated she's always been like (she has owned and runs the fancy one for the past 8 years and has always been a shitty manager lol). During the interview she said I would get paid 15 dollars an hour plus twist but my information for when I get my checks done show where the tips are and the tax reduction, pretty sure she just lied, and I even showed my parents just to get more information and they were also like ""that's really suspicious you need to bring that up asap"". Overall she's just a rude, demeaning, aggressive, psycho lol.  Should I bring this up and try to talk about this with her and say I don't appreciate her attitude plus the whole thing about the tips thing??  And there's no like HR department either because it's not a big corporation or anything, it's not like I can't file a complaint against her lmaooo. It has been affecting my personal life also because Everytime I think about work I get so stressed because of how toxic the environment is.

1iqp45c,https://i.redd.it/v7ye5a5t5hje1.png,REVIEW: Gordon & Mcphail 1948 Glen Grant 72 years old,"I've been meaning to add this review for a couple of years as there should be a record outside of the rarified air at the very top of the whisky market for what is without a shadow of a doubt the greatest whisky ever made. 

The GG72 is one of a set of whiskies referred to as the 'ultra rares' laid down in the 1940s by the legendary 'Mr' George Urquhart of G&M. 

What makes them set apart from normal whisky is that they're matured in 'transport' casks. 

In the days before Spain made it a requirement for sherry to be matured and bottled in Jerez sherry was shipped around the world in casks to be bottled in situ. 

What made those casks special was the extreme thickness of the gauge and the tightness of the seals that made maturation slower and longer but, in the end for greater effect. The ultra rares combine greater flavour with ridiculous ABVs for their age. 

The GG72 bottles are dartington crystal and designed, along with the presentation case, by the Karuizawa design team. They also come with a truly insane 20kg 4'x2' security carry case (which I know from personal experience scuffs horribly at the slightest touch haha 😄).

Before I give the final tasting notes let me first say that the GG72 represents the very pinnacle of whisky production. The worlds greatest whisky experts have stated both publicly and privately that it is the finest they've ever tried. 

When I was privileged enough to taste it it put me in mind of the historian Plutarch who said of Alexander the Great that one day Alexander surveyed the whole of his domain and he sat and began to weep for there was no more world left to conquer.

And thus I felt. I knew that from that day every whisky I would ever try would be compared to that moment in my mind and fall short. I had peaked. There was nowhere else to go. it is, my friends, a terrible and beautiful thing to know you cannot ever do better than you already have. 

But to the review. 

LOOK:
Very dark. Deeper even than aged Glendronach. The closest to actual oloroso colouring as any whisky I've ever seen.
Viscosity extreme. It seems to grip the glass as it swirls. 
Beading clear, defined and precise. 

NOSE:
Smooth and full of life. The promise of what is to come rings with each breath. Astounding to feel such life in a whisky of such age. 
Oak and sherry dominates. Coconut mixed with Christmas spice and the sense of summer fruit rising amist the cacophony of dry spice only to fade each time you focus on it to be left with smoke. Soft, soft smoke the type I have never tasted in a speyside but that my grandfather used to tell stories of lingers. 


PALATE:
Mouthfeel is rich and full. The sensation of fruit jam mixed with red wine and coats the mouth immediately. Again astonishing to encounter such life and vibrancy at such an age.
Sweet fruit arrives first to be immediately replaced by billowing dry Christmas spices and sherry fruit. Each mouthful creates a new combination of flavour that begs to be appreciated before it vanishes and a new one rises out of the mix to tickle the senses when, it too, slides behind the next.

FINISH:
Lingering but not too long. If I was forced to find any way that this godlike dram could be bettered it is that its finish lasts 'only' a full minute in the mouth. 
Flavours of complex smoke fight on the tongue for recognition. Dry phenols alongside coffee and bitter chocolate. Again my grandfather (born 1904) used to speak of a time where speyside whisky flavour contained such smoke but I have never tasted such things. 

CONCLUSION:
Even beyond the flavours and the privilege of tasting a whisky of such value or age is the window that this offers into a world long gone. This whisky is one of the very last opportunities to taste the speysides of myth. The same speysides flavours that the legendary 1920s and 30s macallan bottles will contain. 

Hope you all enjoy my review. I may add others of the ultra rares in time for the record if people are interested. 
But some people may get upset I take a dim view of the macallans lol. ",2,1739700176.0,whisky,0,1.0,False

1iqozxk,https://www.brandblinks.com,"“Building Ideal Stories, Perfect Brands.” Trust me, I’m a LIAR. 🤥","Humans and AI no way sound different now. Building things which sound just perfect, talk about just the wins, and hiding failures like they don’t exist.

No emotion, No connectivity, No struggles. 

I don’t chase perfection. I never have. But I know where it exists—in the raw, unfiltered moments of truth. In the spaces where authenticity isn’t hidden by filters, where honesty isn’t a marketing strategy, and where being human matters more.

Questions like these weren’t ever talked about:

- What if I can’t keep up?
- What if my brand loses its uniqueness?
- What if I grow too fast and it all falls apart?

For nearly a decade, I’ve built brands. I just like everyone else—searching, failing, trying again. And if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s this: perfection doesn’t sell, because perfection isn’t real.

People don’t connect with flawless success stories. They connect with the late nights filled with doubt, the small wins that feel like mountains, the quiet moments where giving up feels easier than pushing forward.

Yet, every day, I see a world that sells a different dream—one where success is effortless, where brands are built overnight, where millions are made without struggle. It’s a lie. Because the truth is, nobody has it all figured out. No strategy works forever. No path is straight. We’re all just experimenting, learning, evolving.

And as a founder, I relate to every single person who does or has ever stayed up at 3 AM, eyes burning, fueled by coffee and an impossible dream. We live on challenges. We wake up to uncertainty. And yet, we keep going—because we believe in something bigger than ourselves.

You are not alone. Every one of us has faced the questions that try to pull us back, the doubts that whisper, “Maybe this isn’t for me.” But it takes courage to step forward despite the fear, to give everything we have in the hope that one day, our vision will change the world.

That’s why I built Brand Blinks — Made for the Uncommon. 

Not to sell illusions, but to build something real. A space where emotions matter, where partnerships are built on trust, where honesty comes before hype. Because the world doesn’t need another empty promise. It needs something true.

This is me. Not just as a founder, not just as a CEO. But as a human. Speaking my truth, raw and unfiltered. Because we’re in this together.

“To love someone is to see them in ways no one else can. To trace the lines of their face, the cadence of their laugh, the way they retreat into themselves when the world becomes too much.

“But love doesn’t mean knowing everything. It doesn’t mean fitting the pieces together perfectly. Even in the closest relationships, parts of us remain hidden—intentionally or otherwise.

“This is the story of Ellis through the eyes of someone who loved them. Or, at least, tried to.”

I met Ellis at a bookstore. The kind with narrow aisles, shelves that creaked, and the faint smell of old paper hanging in the air.

I was standing in the nonfiction section, pretending to browse, when I heard their voice.

“It’s a good one,” they said, nodding toward the book in my hands. Their voice was low, steady, like they were commenting on the weather.

I looked up, startled. I hadn’t even realized anyone else was there. “Oh. Yeah?”

Ellis nodded. “The author has a way of cutting through the noise. It’s refreshing.”

I glanced at the book’s cover, suddenly aware that I didn’t know anything about it. I’d picked it up because the title looked interesting, but now I felt an odd pressure to seem like I did. “I’ve heard good things,” I said, trying to sound casual.

Ellis smiled faintly, and for a second, I thought they were going to walk away. But instead, they stepped closer, their eyes scanning the shelves. “If you like that, you might enjoy this one,” they said, pulling another book from the shelf and handing it to me.

And just like that, we started talking.

Ellis wasn’t like anyone I’d ever met. They were thoughtful, curious, but also… contained. Like there was a part of them they were always holding back, even in the most open moments.

We spent hours together in that bookstore, moving from aisle to aisle, sharing thoughts about books we’d read, books we wanted to read, books we pretended we’d read. By the time we left, it felt like I’d known them for years.

But Ellis had a way of making you feel that way.

Our first few months together were easy. Ellis liked quiet places—parks, libraries, cafes with dim lighting and soft music. They didn’t talk much, but when they did, their words felt deliberate, like they’d been chosen carefully from a long list of possibilities.

I liked that about them. I liked how intentional they were, how present they seemed in the moment.

But as time went on, I started noticing the gaps.

It wasn’t anything obvious. Just little things—the way they avoided questions about their past, the way they’d change the subject when conversations drifted too close to home.

Once, I asked them about their family.

“Not much to say,” they replied, their tone light but distant.

“Everyone’s family has something to say,” I pressed gently.

Ellis shrugged. “Maybe. But mine isn’t worth talking about.”

That was the end of it.

It wasn’t that Ellis didn’t care. They cared deeply—I could see it in the way they listened, the way they remembered the smallest details about me, the way they’d leave a book or a note or a perfectly chosen cup of tea waiting for me after a long day.

But there were walls. Not big, obvious ones. Subtle ones, woven into the fabric of who they were.

I tried to break through them, but it always felt like I was only scratching the surface.

There was one night I still think about, years later. We’d been arguing—about what, I can’t even remember now. Something stupid, something small.

I’d said something sharp, something I regretted the moment it left my mouth, and Ellis had gone quiet. Not angry, not defensive. Just… quiet.

After a long pause, they looked at me and said, “You’re probably right.”

It wasn’t what I expected. It wasn’t what I wanted, either.

“Ellis, I don’t want to be right,” I said, my voice breaking. “I want to know what you’re thinking. I want to know how you feel.”

They stared at me for a long moment, their expression unreadable. Then they said, “I don’t think I know how to answer that.”

It wasn’t an admission. It was a barrier.

I wish I could tell you I understood Ellis. That I had some insight into who they were, deep down.

But the truth is, I don’t think anyone really did. Not their coworkers, not their friends, not even me.

I loved them. I still do, in some ways. But love doesn’t mean understanding, and it doesn’t mean knowing. Sometimes, it just means being there, even when you don’t have the answers.

That’s what Ellis taught me.

“Love is a reflection, a lens through which we see the best and worst of someone. It magnifies their kindness, their flaws, their mystery.

“But love doesn’t dissolve walls—it only shines a light on them. To this person, Ellis was a paradox: deeply caring, yet profoundly guarded.

“Was that who Ellis truly was? Or was it just another version of them, shaped by the limits of what love can reveal?

“Let’s move forward. Another story, another lens, another fragment of Ellis.”

“Love, when it ends, leaves traces. Some linger as warmth, others as scars. To this person, Ellis was a wound that never fully healed—a quiet heartbreak that reshaped how they saw the world, and themselves.

“But even heartbreak isn’t simple. Even when someone leaves you, when they disappoint you, there are pieces of them you carry—pieces that refuse to be buried under bitterness. This is their story.”

I’d like to tell you I hate Ellis Carter.

It would be easier that way, wouldn’t it? To wrap it all up in anger, to take the hurt and the unanswered questions and shove them into a neat little box labeled hate.

But the truth is, I don’t. I never could.

That doesn’t mean I don’t want to.

Ellis and I were never supposed to work. I knew it, my friends knew it, even Ellis probably knew it. But knowing something doesn’t mean you can stop yourself from wanting it.

They had this way of making you feel like the center of the world. Not with grand gestures or over-the-top declarations, but with the little things—the way they’d notice when you were quiet and ask, “What’s on your mind?” The way they’d leave a note tucked into your book with a quote they thought you’d like. The way they remembered things, even the small, unimportant things, like the way I always picked out the red Skittles first or how I hated when people talked during movies.

I fell for Ellis before I even realized what was happening.

It wasn’t perfect. How could it be?

Ellis wasn’t exactly easy to love. They kept so much of themselves hidden, locked away behind walls I never quite managed to scale. For every quiet moment of connection, there were two moments where they pulled back, retreating into some part of themselves I wasn’t allowed to see.

At first, I thought it was just a matter of time. I thought, If I’m patient, if I’m kind, if I love them enough, they’ll let me in.

But Ellis didn’t work that way.

I remember the night I realized it was over.

We’d been out with friends, some dinner party at someone’s apartment. I’d spent most of the evening watching Ellis from across the room, the way they floated through conversations, smiling faintly, never saying more than they had to. People liked Ellis. They found them fascinating, enigmatic.

But I knew the difference between being interesting and being known.

On the way home, I asked a question I’d been holding back for weeks. “Do you ever feel like you’re keeping me out?”

Ellis didn’t answer right away. They were staring out the window, the city lights flickering across their face.

“Sometimes,” they said finally.

It was honest, I’ll give them that. But honesty isn’t always comforting.

When Ellis left, they didn’t slam the door or throw accusations. They didn’t make it dramatic. They just… ended it.

“It’s not fair to you,” they said, standing in the doorway of our apartment, their bag slung over one shoulder. “You deserve someone who can give you more.”

I wanted to scream at them, to tell them I didn’t want more, I wanted them. But the words stuck in my throat, heavy and useless.

Ellis left quietly, the way they did everything. And just like that, they were gone.

For weeks after, I told myself I hated them. I told my friends Ellis was selfish, emotionally unavailable, a coward. They nodded, offered to take me out for drinks, and promised I’d find someone better.

But in the quiet moments, when no one was around to listen, I didn’t feel hate. I felt… sadness.

Because for all their flaws, all the ways they frustrated me, Ellis wasn’t cruel. They didn’t leave because they didn’t care. They left because they did.

The last time I saw Ellis was at a coffee shop, years after the breakup. I was with someone else by then, someone steady and uncomplicated. Ellis was sitting by the window, their black notebook open in front of them, a cup of coffee growing cold on the table.

They looked up as I passed, their eyes meeting mine for the briefest moment. They smiled, just slightly, a small, faint thing that didn’t reach their eyes.

I wanted to say something, to ask how they were, but I didn’t. I kept walking, the weight of that unfinished chapter pressing against my chest.

So, no. I don’t hate Ellis Carter.

I miss them, sometimes. I wonder if they’ve changed, if they’ve found someone who managed to climb the walls I couldn’t. But I don’t hate them.

How could I hate someone who gave me so much, even if it was never enough?

“Heartbreak is a strange thing. It lingers, reshaping itself into something softer over time. To this person, Ellis was both a wound and a gift, someone who left before they could truly stay.

“Did Ellis leave to protect them? Or was Ellis protecting themselves? Perhaps both.

“But the answers don’t matter now. What matters is this: another version of Ellis, another piece of the puzzle, another thread in the fabric of a life.”

""Stories are built on perception. Each of us sees through our own lens, shapes the world through the narrow slit of our experiences. But what if the truth isn’t in the individual stories, but in the spaces between them?""

""This is the story of Ellis through their own eyes. The moments they never spoke of, the pieces no one else saw. This is not the Ellis of perception, but the Ellis of reality.""

I have always been watching. Listening. Adapting. Trying to make sense of the world while remaining a part of it, yet never quite belonging.

I was the quiet one. The steady one. The thoughtful one. The distant one. The enigma. The lover. The fleeting shadow in a room full of people. Each of these people thought they knew me, but none of them truly did. Not because they weren’t paying attention—but because I never let them. Because I was more comfortable being an echo rather than a voice.

How do you decide which pieces of yourself to show the world? Which versions to reveal and which to keep locked away? It isn’t about deception. It’s about survival. And sometimes, it’s about something even simpler—self-preservation. The more you reveal, the more vulnerable you become. So, I hid. I became layers of perception, reflections of expectation.

When I was young, I learned that truth was fragile. That people didn’t always want to see you for who you were—they wanted to see what they needed you to be. A mirror for their own expectations, not a window into something real. So I became adaptable. I became what they wanted. Not out of malice, not out of calculation, but out of necessity. If I could be what others needed, then maybe I could find a place where I truly belonged. But what I found instead was exhaustion. A life lived on the terms of others, molded and reshaped until I could barely recognize myself in the process.

To my coworkers, I was the reliable one, the voice of reason in a chaotic world. That was true—but it was also incomplete. I wasn’t just steady. I was tired. Exhausted, really. Carrying burdens no one saw, navigating anxieties no one would have believed. I spent my days holding things together, fixing problems that weren’t mine to fix, bearing weights that weren’t mine to carry. But they didn’t ask, and I didn’t tell. Because it was easier that way. Because admitting the truth meant unraveling everything I had spent years carefully assembling.

To my friends, I was a mystery, someone they could never quite figure out. They saw the walls, but they didn’t see the fear behind them. The fear that if I let them in too far, they’d find something unworthy, something disappointing. So I let them wonder. It was easier that way. Easier than seeing the look in their eyes when they realized I wasn’t who they wanted me to be.

To the person I loved, I was an unfinished story, a closed book with missing chapters. I wanted to love fully, to give freely—but how do you give what you do not believe you have? I tried. God, I tried. But love is built on trust, and I was never sure I could trust myself. I could give pieces of myself—small glimpses, little offerings—but I never knew how to give it all. Because giving meant risking. Giving meant exposing. And I had spent too long perfecting the art of concealment to suddenly lay myself bare.

So I left. Because leaving was easier than staying. Because leaving meant I didn’t have to watch disappointment settle in their eyes. Because leaving meant I wouldn’t have to answer questions I was too afraid to ask myself.

Some called it distance. Others, coldness. Some said I was protecting myself. Others thought I was protecting them. Maybe all of it was true. Maybe none of it was. Maybe it didn’t matter.

But what they never saw, what they could never know, is that I wasn’t just pulling away. I wasn’t just lost. I was already gone. And maybe—just maybe—I had been gone for a long, long time.

""Every story ends. Some with resolution, others with questions. Some leave echoes that ripple long after they are gone.""

""This is the last story of Ellis Carter. The story that has been waiting to be told.""

I am not here.

I was the one in the room at the start of all this, the one whose name sat on the plaque, the one whose photograph was framed in quiet solemnity.

They spoke of me. They tried to piece together the fragments, to shape something whole out of the slivers of who I was. But the thing about echoes is that they only tell you where something once was, not what it truly was.

You have heard me through their voices. You have seen me through their eyes. And now, you must ask yourself:

Can you say you truly know me?

Or were you only ever given glimpses, fragments carefully chosen?

Now that you have walked this path, seen through their eyes, tell me—

1iqowv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1iqowv0/the_fragments_of_a_life_part_1/,The Fragments of a Life (part 1),"The room was unremarkable. Pale walls stretched upward to a ceiling lit by fluorescent lights that hummed faintly in the silence. Rows of gray chairs filled the space, lined up with a precision that felt almost mechanical. At the front of the room stood a modest wooden podium, its surface nicked and worn, as if it had borne the weight of countless words.

Beside it, a photograph of Ellis Carter rested on a small easel. They were smiling—just slightly. It wasn’t the kind of smile that demanded attention, nor one that betrayed much about the person behind it. It was quiet, unassuming, like they were posing for a picture they hadn’t entirely agreed to.

Beneath the photograph was a brass plaque, engraved with Ellis’s name and two dates. A beginning, an end, and a thin line between them that hinted at the years they had lived. A whole life, compressed into a single engraving.

But a name and a pair of dates couldn’t tell a story. That much was obvious to everyone in the room.

People sat in silence, their gazes shifting between the photograph and their own thoughts. There was no single thread uniting them, no clear narrative that tied them all to Ellis. Some faces were etched with grief; others seemed more distant, as though they were here out of obligation, or perhaps curiosity.

A few sat with folded hands, their postures stiff, rehearsing what they might say when it was their turn to speak. Others avoided the podium entirely, retreating into the background, content to listen and remember silently.

This was what was left of a life: a gathering of impressions. A collection of people who had known Ellis—not as a whole, but in pieces.

To the coworkers, Ellis had been a steady hand in a chaotic world. To the students, a quiet force of encouragement. To the family members, a mix of closeness and distance, laughter and quiet. And to others, they had been something else entirely—or perhaps, nothing at all.

Each of them carried a version of Ellis in their mind. But which version was the truth? Or was the truth somewhere in the overlap of all the versions, or perhaps in the spaces between them?

This is the strange thing about funerals: they aren’t for the dead. They’re for the living, the ones left behind to make sense of the void. The ones tasked with piecing together the fragments of a life from the memories they carry.

And so, one by one, they would rise to the podium to speak. Each would offer their version of Ellis, shaped by their own perspective, their own story. And as they did, the Ellis they described would shift and change, depending on the teller.

The fragments wouldn’t fit together neatly. They never do.

But before they began, let me ask you this: how do you truly know someone? Is it through the stories others tell? The things they leave behind? Or is it something more elusive—something that even they couldn’t grasp about themselves?

Perhaps, by the end of this, you’ll have an answer. Or perhaps, you’ll only have more questions. After all, Ellis Carter isn’t here to speak for themselves.

The rest is up to us.

“The room quiets now. The first speaker rises to their feet. They walk toward the podium, their footsteps echoing faintly in the stillness.

“And so, the fragments of Ellis begin to take shape. Let’s listen, shall we? Let’s see who they were—through the eyes of those who thought they knew them.”

“Imagine someone sitting at the edge of a storm—a calm center while chaos swirls around them. That’s who Ellis was to some. Not everyone, of course. To others, they were a mystery, distant and unknowable. But to those who worked alongside them, Ellis was solid ground.

“Still, I wonder, can you really know someone just by their steadiness? Can a person be reduced to reliability, as if their value lies only in how they serve others?

“Let’s see Ellis through the eyes of a coworker. Someone who admired their calmness, their clarity. Someone who thought they had Ellis figured out, until the edges of the story began to blur.”

The clock on the wall ticked loudly, its steady rhythm a cruel reminder of the chaos unfolding in the room. It seemed to mock us, marking time we didn’t have as the air grew heavier with tension. Papers were scattered across the long conference table, some crumpled, others highlighted and annotated into near illegibility. Laptops sat open, their screens filled with color-coded spreadsheets and email chains so long they seemed to spiral into infinity. None of it made any sense.

The client’s demands had changed—again—and now our once carefully planned project had unraveled into a frantic, overlapping mess of voices and frustrations.

“We need to focus on the numbers!” someone barked, their tone sharp enough to cut through the room.

“We don’t have time for that!” another snapped back, their voice strained, on the verge of breaking.

It was like a storm, everyone shouting over each other, desperate to find some clarity but only adding to the noise. My hands gripped the edges of my chair, fingers digging into the hard plastic as I tried to ground myself. I could feel the pressure mounting, creeping up my chest like a weight I couldn’t shake.

Then, my eyes landed on Ellis.

They sat at the far end of the table, straight-backed, their pen poised lightly over a notepad, as if none of this chaos had reached them. Their expression was calm, almost disinterested, their gaze steady as they watched the meeting unfold. They looked less like someone embroiled in a professional meltdown and more like an anthropologist observing some peculiar ritual.

I remember feeling a surge of irritation in that moment. How could they just sit there, unbothered, while the rest of us were falling apart? Didn’t they care?

But then, Ellis raised their hand. Not dramatically, not forcefully—just a subtle, deliberate gesture. The room fell quiet almost immediately. It was remarkable, really. They didn’t even have to say anything, but their presence alone demanded attention.

“Let’s break this down,” Ellis said, their voice even, unhurried. “What’s the client actually asking for? Not what we think they want—what they’ve actually said.”

The room stilled. For a moment, there was just silence, the kind that makes you realize how much noise you’d been drowning in.

That was Ellis. They had this uncanny ability to cut through chaos like a blade, to find the heart of a problem and focus everyone on it like a laser.

Ellis wasn’t the kind of person you got to know well—not in the office, anyway. They weren’t like Tom, who knew everyone’s birthday and brought donuts on Fridays, or Michelle, who always had a funny story about her kids. Ellis came in, did their work, and left. If you asked them how their weekend was, they’d give you a polite answer—maybe a sentence or two about a hike they went on or a book they’d read—but you got the sense they’d rather not linger on small talk.

At first, I thought they were aloof. Cold, even. I didn’t understand them. But then there were moments—moments like that meeting—when they’d step in, quiet and unassuming, and everything would just… work.

I remember one time, during a particularly rough quarter, when the whole department was drowning. Deadlines were stacked on top of deadlines, and the weight of it all felt suffocating. I was staying late, well past everyone else, trying to clean up a report that had gone sideways. My desk was a mess of sticky notes and coffee-stained printouts, and my eyes burned from staring at the screen for too long.

That’s when Ellis appeared in the doorway of the break room.

“You should go home,” they said, leaning casually against the frame.

I laughed bitterly. “Yeah, sure. And who’s going to fix this mess if I do?”

Ellis walked in without another word, set their bag down on the counter, and poured themselves a cup of coffee. For a moment, I thought that was the end of it—just an observation, no follow-up. But then they sat across from me, their coffee steaming between us, and said, “You can’t do good work when you’re burned out. Go home. I’ll take care of it.”

I stared at them, unsure if they were serious. But Ellis just pulled the report toward them, flipping through the pages with their usual calm efficiency.

“Seriously?” I asked.

Ellis didn’t look up. “You’ve been here twelve hours. Go home.”

And so, reluctantly, I went. I hated the feeling of leaving my mess for someone else, hated the idea that I couldn’t handle it myself. But when I came in the next morning, the report was sitting on my desk, fixed. Not just fixed—perfect. Better than I could’ve done, even on my best day.

Ellis never mentioned it again.

That’s who Ellis was to me: someone who didn’t say much but always knew what needed to be done. Someone you could count on, even if you didn’t always understand them.

The thing is, though, I don’t think I ever really knew them. Not beyond the version of them I saw in the office. I didn’t know what they did after work, who they spent time with, what they dreamed about. I didn’t even know if they liked their job or if they were just good at it.

There was a moment—years later, after they’d left the company—when I ran into Ellis at a coffee shop. I was in line, looking at my phone, and I heard their voice behind me: “You should try the chai.”

I turned around, and there they were, holding a cup and smiling faintly.

“Ellis! Wow, it’s been ages,” I said.

We talked for a few minutes—small talk about the weather, what they were up to now (something vague about consulting). It was a pleasant conversation, but I remember feeling this strange distance, like I was talking to someone I knew and didn’t know at the same time.

When I asked how they were doing, Ellis paused for just a moment before answering. “I’m… figuring it out,” they said.

And that was the last time I saw them.

“And there you have it: Ellis, the steady one. The dependable one. A coworker who always knew how to cut through the noise, who carried more than their share without complaint.

“But tell me, is that enough to truly know them? Did their calmness hide something deeper—something this coworker never saw? Or was that calmness their truest self, a steady hand in a world that often spins too fast?

“It’s tempting, isn’t it, to take a single version of someone and call it the truth? To say, ‘This is who they were,’ and leave it at that. But life isn’t so simple, and neither was Ellis. Let’s turn the page and see them through another set of eyes. Perhaps their next chapter will tell us more—or perhaps it will only deepen the mystery.”

“Every story has a shape—a pattern that makes it easy to follow, easy to understand. But not every person does. Some people defy the tidy patterns we try to impose on them, slipping through our attempts to define them.

“Ellis was one of those people. To some, they were steady, dependable, a rock in turbulent waters. But to others, they were something else entirely—an enigma, a puzzle that refused to be solved.

“This story comes from someone who worked alongside Ellis for years, someone who watched, wondered, and, at times, struggled to make sense of who they were. Let’s step into their perspective now. Let’s see Ellis through eyes that didn’t always find answers.”

Ellis Carter was the kind of person who could make you feel like you were talking to a locked door. You’d knock, expecting someone to open it, but all you’d hear was the echo of your own voice on the other side.

It wasn’t rudeness, exactly—it wasn’t like they ignored you or brushed you off. Ellis was always polite, always professional. But polite doesn’t mean open, and professional doesn’t mean warm.

I worked with Ellis for five years, long enough to know their habits, their rhythms. Every morning, they’d walk in at exactly 8:55 a.m., no earlier, no later. They’d set their bag down by their desk, take out that same black notebook, and pour themselves a cup of coffee. Black. No sugar, no cream. You could’ve set a clock by them.

At first, I thought it was discipline, a kind of quiet determination that kept them so precise. But the more I watched, the more it felt… hollow.

One day, I tried to break the routine. I stopped by their desk with a box of donuts, the kind with sprinkles and glaze that always made people in the office perk up.

“Hey, Ellis,” I said, holding the box out like a peace offering. “Want one? Fresh from the bakery down the street.”

They glanced up from their notebook, their pen hovering mid-sentence. Their eyes flicked to the box for just a second before they shook their head.

“Thanks, but I’m good,” they said, their voice calm, measured, like they’d already rehearsed the response.

That was it. No explanation, no follow-up. Just a quiet refusal and a return to their notes.

I stood there for a moment, trying to think of something else to say, but they didn’t look up again. Eventually, I walked away, feeling like I’d just failed some kind of test I didn’t even know I was taking.

Ellis was good at their job—there was no denying that. They were efficient, methodical, and rarely made mistakes. But they never went beyond what was asked of them. While the rest of us threw ourselves into brainstorming sessions and late-night strategy meetings, Ellis stuck to the task at hand. They didn’t offer ideas unless asked directly, and even then, their answers were short and to the point, like they were conserving words for something more important.

It frustrated me sometimes. I’d be in the middle of some overblown presentation, pitching ideas like my job depended on it, and there Ellis would be, sitting in the corner with their arms crossed, their expression unreadable. Were they bored? Critical? Just waiting for it to be over? I never knew.

But there were moments—rare and fleeting—when that door I mentioned, the one that always felt locked, seemed to crack open just a little.

One afternoon, the office was unusually quiet. Most of the team had left early for some off-site meeting, and I stayed behind, trying to finish a report that was due by the end of the week. I was staring at my screen, fighting off the familiar haze of fatigue, when I heard a voice behind me.

“Long day?”

I turned to see Ellis standing there, their black notebook tucked under one arm. It was such a simple question, but coming from them, it felt strangely significant.

“Yeah,” I said, laughing softly. “Feels like every day is long lately.”

Ellis nodded, their gaze distant. For a moment, I thought they’d walk away, like they always did after these brief exchanges. But instead, they sat down in the chair next to me.

“You ever think about what you’d be doing if you weren’t here?” they asked, their voice unusually quiet.

The question caught me off guard. It wasn’t the kind of thing Ellis usually said. In fact, I couldn’t remember them ever asking a personal question before.

“Sometimes,” I admitted. “Why? You thinking of jumping ship?”

Ellis smiled faintly, but there was something in their expression—something I couldn’t quite place.

“Just wondering,” they said, their voice soft. “I think about it sometimes. What else is out there.”

And just like that, the moment was over. They stood up, adjusted their notebook, and walked back to their desk. I watched them go, feeling like I’d just glimpsed something rare, something real, but it had slipped through my fingers before I could grasp it.

That was Ellis to me: someone I worked with, someone I respected, but also someone I could never really reach.

I wonder, sometimes, if they even wanted to be reached.

“Some people are easy to know—or at least, they make it seem that way. Their words, their actions, their choices all point in the same direction, leaving little room for ambiguity.

“Ellis wasn’t like that. They were a puzzle, a contradiction, a person who left others wondering.

“But is that such a bad thing? Perhaps the parts of ourselves we choose to withhold are just as important as the parts we share. Perhaps being a little unknowable is what makes us human.

“Let’s move forward now, to another story, another version of Ellis. And as we do, keep this question in mind: how much of what you see is real, and how much is just a reflection of your own expectations?”

“Some people are open books, their pages written in big, bold letters for anyone to read. Others are locked doors, their stories hidden behind walls, revealing only what they choose, if anything at all.

“Ellis Carter was a locked door for some. To others, they were an open window—calm, reliable, a steady presence. But for this coworker, Ellis was something harder to grasp: a question left unanswered, a puzzle missing its final piece.”

“This is their story. Let’s see Ellis through their eyes.”

“This story comes from the eyes of someone who barely knew Ellis at all—at least, not in the way others did. A new intern, unsure of themselves, unpolished and unsteady. To the world, they might have been invisible. But Ellis saw them. Let’s step into their shoes now and see what Ellis saw.”

It was my first real job, and I was already sure I was going to mess it up.

The elevator ride to the tenth floor had been long and silent, and the air inside the office felt just as heavy. The kind of place where people moved with purpose, their heads down, their steps brisk. I’d been here less than a week, but already, I felt like I didn’t belong.

I’d dropped my coffee on my first day. Right in the middle of the break room, the mug shattering in a spectacular splash of brown liquid and ceramic shards. Everyone had turned to look, their eyes heavy with the kind of annoyance that didn’t need words.

Ellis was there. They didn’t say anything, just handed me a roll of paper towels from the counter and walked away.

That was Ellis. Quiet. Observant. Impossible to read.

The second week wasn’t much better. I’d been assigned to help with the monthly reports, a massive spreadsheet that looked like it had been built in a foreign language. I tried to stay out of everyone’s way, nodding and smiling and pretending I understood what I was supposed to be doing.

But one afternoon, Ellis appeared beside my desk, their black notebook tucked under one arm.

“How’s it going?” they asked.

I froze. My hands were hovering over the keyboard, and my screen was open to a page that was definitely not the monthly report.

“Uh… good,” I said, my voice cracking. “Fine. Just… you know, working on the, uh…”

Ellis tilted their head, glancing at my screen.

“The report,” I finished lamely.

They didn’t respond right away. Instead, they set their notebook on the edge of my desk and pulled up a chair.

“Let’s see what you’ve got so far,” they said.

I stared at them, unsure if I was about to be fired or lectured. But Ellis’s expression was calm, unhurried. Not annoyed, not judgmental. Just… steady.

We spent the next hour going through the report together. Ellis didn’t laugh at my mistakes or sigh when I asked questions that probably seemed stupid. They just pointed things out, made quiet corrections, and walked me through formulas that felt like magic spells. By the time we finished, the spreadsheet actually made sense. For the first time, I felt like I wasn’t completely lost.

“You’re getting there,” Ellis said as they stood to leave. I blinked. “Really?”

They nodded. “You’ve got the basics down. The rest will come with time.”

That was it. No big speech, no “you’ll do great” pep talk. Just those simple words, delivered with the kind of certainty that made me want to believe them.

After that, I started noticing things about Ellis.

They didn’t talk much in meetings, but when they did, people listened. Their voice was steady, their points concise. They never seemed rattled, never raised their voice or got caught up in the frantic energy that filled the office most days.

They also noticed things no one else did. Like the day I almost dropped a stack of reports in the hallway. I caught them at the last second, the papers spilling across the edges of my arms. No one else looked up, but Ellis did. They walked over, took half the stack without a word, and carried it to my desk.

“Thanks,” I mumbled, feeling my face flush.

They just nodded and walked away.

There was one moment, though, that stuck with me more than the others. It was late one evening, and I was the last one in the office. Or so I thought.

I’d been staying late all week, trying to fix the mess I’d made of a presentation draft. The slides were clunky, the data didn’t line up, and no matter how many times I rearranged things, it all looked wrong.

I was about to give up when I heard a voice behind me.

“Still here?”

I turned to see Ellis standing in the doorway, their black notebook tucked under one arm.

“Yeah,” I said, rubbing the back of my neck. “Just… trying to finish this thing.”

Ellis walked over, their eyes scanning the open slides on my laptop.

“Mind if I take a look?” they asked.

I didn’t know what else to do, so I moved aside and let them sit down.

For the next twenty minutes, they went through the slides one by one, pointing out where the transitions could be smoother, where the data needed more context, where the colors were too hard to read. They didn’t take over—they just nudged me in the right direction, asking questions and making quiet suggestions until the whole thing actually started to make sense.

When we finished, I looked at them, not sure what to say.

“Better,” they said simply, closing my laptop.

“Thanks,” I said, my voice soft. “I… I wasn’t sure I could do it.”

Ellis turned to leave, but before they did, they glanced back at me.

“You’ll figure it out,” they said. “You’re better at this than you think.”

That was the thing about Ellis. They never made a big deal out of anything, but they always seemed to know exactly what you needed. They didn’t give praise lightly, didn’t hand out compliments just to be nice. But when they said something, you believed it.

I don’t know if anyone else in the office ever saw that side of them. To most people, Ellis was quiet, reserved, a little distant. But to me, they were something else entirely.

They were the first person who made me feel like I belonged.

“To the intern, Ellis was more than just a coworker. They were a guide, a quiet mentor who saw potential where others saw uncertainty.

“But isn’t that the way of things? Sometimes the people who seem invisible to the world are the ones who leave the deepest impressions on us.

“It’s easy to think we only leave our mark on the people closest to us—the friends we see daily, the coworkers we collaborate with, the family we hold dear. But sometimes, the most unexpected connections are the ones that linger.

“For Ellis, those connections weren’t always about the big moments. They were about the quiet ones—the kind that slip by unnoticed until someone takes the time to tell their story.

“This is another perspective on Ellis, one that might feel fleeting, yet holds just as much weight as any other.”

The office was always quieter at night. Not silent, exactly—the air conditioning hummed, the printer clicked occasionally, and the faint glow of the city lights filtered in through the windows. But it was a different kind of quiet. The kind where you could think without the rush of people around you.

I liked it. It gave me time to work at my own pace, to clean each desk, empty each trash can, and wipe down the counters in the break room without feeling like I was in someone’s way.

Most of the time, the place was empty by the time I arrived. But every so often, there’d be a few stragglers—people hunched over their desks, their faces lit by the pale blue glow of their screens.

Ellis was one of those people.

The first time I saw them, I almost didn’t notice. They were tucked away in the corner, their notebook open in front of them, their pen moving steadily across the page. They didn’t look up as I passed, and I didn’t think much of it.

But then, the next night, it happened again. And the night after that.

Ellis was always there, always quiet, always working.

One evening, I was cleaning the break room when they walked in. They nodded to me—a small, polite gesture—and poured themselves a cup of coffee.

“Long night?” they asked, their voice calm and steady.

I blinked, caught off guard. Most people didn’t talk to me, let alone notice I was there.

“Uh, yeah,” I said, fumbling with the rag in my hands. “You?”

Ellis shrugged. “Could be worse.”

They didn’t say anything else, just stood there sipping their coffee, their gaze drifting toward the window. I finished wiping down the counter, unsure if I was supposed to say something.

“Have a good night,” they said finally, turning to leave.

“You too,” I replied, but they were already gone.

It became a pattern after that. Whenever our paths crossed, Ellis would nod, sometimes say hello, always polite but never overbearing.

One night, I was struggling with a particularly stubborn stain on one of the break room tables when they walked in. I must’ve been muttering under my breath because they stopped and looked at me.

“Everything okay?” they asked.

“Yeah, just this coffee spill,” I said, holding up the rag.

Ellis walked over, set down their notebook, and grabbed a napkin from the counter. Without a word, they started wiping the other end of the table.

“You don’t have to do that,” I said quickly.

“I know,” they replied, their tone as steady as ever. “But it’s faster this way.”

I didn’t know what to say to that, so I just nodded and kept scrubbing.

When we finished, Ellis picked up their notebook, nodded again, and left. It wasn’t much, but it stuck with me.

A few weeks later, I found a book sitting on the counter in the break room, next to a folded piece of paper. The note said: For you. Thought you might like it. - Ellis.

I didn’t even know they remembered our conversation about history, let alone cared enough to leave me a book. It wasn’t the kind of thing I’d normally read—dense, full of dates and maps—but I took it home anyway.

I never thanked them for it. I meant to, but by the time I worked up the nerve, Ellis wasn’t working late anymore. I didn’t see them again after that.

To most people in that office, I don’t think Ellis was much more than a coworker—a quiet presence in the background, reliable but not remarkable.

But to me, they were the first person who made me feel seen.

“Ellis had a way of noticing the overlooked. They saw people, saw moments, and acted quietly, without expectation of thanks or recognition.

“To this person, Ellis wasn’t a coworker or a mentor—they were something simpler and yet just as profound: a reminder that even in the quietest corners of life, we leave an impact.",1,1739699295.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1iqowuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1iqowuo/i_31m_need_to_open_about_about_an_event_that/,I (31M) need to open about about an event that happened in 2023 with me ex (27F),"We met in 2021 at work. She joined few months prior to me as a trainee while i directly joined as a staff due to my previous work experience. She got promoted to a staff which is the same level as me. We had a chemistry and we hit it off. Now hered the catch: She had alot of male friends (you know where this is headed) and many of the make friends confessed that they like her but she rejected them. Many if them maintained their boundaries and she often met them.

I will never forget one incident. I decided to join her and her make friend while they were having coffee at our company cafeteria. Now this guy isnt one of her male friends who likes her so i didnt have any issues moreover he was a guy whom she constantly used to talk about. We eventually got to know each other where we exchanged smiles and “whatsups” but never spoke in detail so i took this opportunity to get to know him. Big mistake. The entire time she was immersed in talking to him that she barely acknolwdged me. I remember staring at the empty tea cup while they kept on talking. It was the akwardest 20-30 mins of my life.
Like i barely existed. I felt like a third wheel in my own relationship. She was all smily and just looking at him while barely asking about my day. I eventually excused myself out. This eas somewhere in Feb 2022.

Fast forward to March 2023. I quit my job because i got a better paying  job in another city. She quit hers and was on notice period. She told me she plans to meet one of her friend who was one among the few she used to say about since she has resigned and may leave the city. Now they used to be close long time ago and even met once. He likes her which she was aware. Now pay attention because this piece of info is crucial for later part of the stort.

*According to her, during their friendship days he often used to pressure her to a relationship by saying “Is this really a friendship? Isnt this something more?. I feel like we are in a relationship even though we arent a couple”

“I have encountered so many girls but for the first time Im meeting someone whom i want to have a life with”


Now this was years back and they drifted apart. Now he began sending signals again and he still isnt aware of us. Heres how our convo went on this

> Why are you entertaining his messages? Why dont you block him?

> What if you dump me one day? I may need a backup right? 

> me: 😐 

> heyy i was joking 🤦‍♀️

I knew it was a joke but of terrible taste. I maintained the seriousness of the topic. 

> Then why are you keeping me as a secret from him. Cant you tell ur in a relationship?

> Hey i cant do that. We had a long history. He was there for me when I was having a hard time. We had similar interests and views about life. We even shared interests of books to read. Blah blah

I suggested her to tell him about me else he may keep his hopes high however she insisted she wants to tell in person. I wasnt keen on the idea because;

1. He likes her for a long time and since she is initiating a meetup he may gets his hopes high. 

2. When he realizes shes in a relationship he may get heartbroken and we wont know how he will react to it. Not many men takes rejection lightly

I insisted that its not a good idea to meet him while he isnt aware about me and we may never know how he will react when he proposes and she rejects him to which she said

> But im not rejecting him. Im just going to reveal my source of happiness

> ???

> You. You are my happiness

Eww as if its gonna flatter me. It didnt melt my heart like she expected it to. Again I stood firm on this and told she is not being a good friend by doing this. The talk went to an argument where she claims “i cant be responsible for someone else feelings towards me”. Alot of harsh words were exchanged that night and it left a bad taste in my mouth because this isnt how you treat your friends. I stopped thr argument halfway and went to bed.

The next morning however I still felt uneasy. I went to his Instagram page and saw his contact number available. I couldnt resist. I decided to call him. Reason I decided to call was;


Im a guy and i know what it feels like to like a girl for many years only to realise she likes someone else 

Not everyone takes rejection nicely. I feared for her safety

So I called him. I said “Hi im X’s boyfriend and we have been committed for one and a half years. She has told about you but I believe she never mentioned about me?”

 To which he said “no she didnt say anything”. 

His response was so casual. There was no shock on his voice but rather confused. I continued;

 “I believe you guys have plans to meet right? Look I know you liked her and you guys used to be close but shes committed now. I heard you approached to meet her.. which im fine but dont have your hopes high and dont keep the feelings you had for her”.

Here comes the big twist. He responds;

Him: But i never approached her. She was the one who came and said she wants to meet. 

*According to him, during their friendship days she often used to pressure him to a relationship by saying “Is this really a friendship? Isnt this something more?. I feel like we are in a relationship even though we arent a couple” but back then he wasnt ready because he didnt have a job yet she asked him to come and meet his family.


“I have encountered so many guys in my life but for the first time I feel I finally know whom i want to have a life with”


He quoted the exact words she said. This isnt just some cross accusations. He repeated same quote of dialogues said by her which she claims to be said by him. My blood was boiling at this point.

She has been asking to meet for a while and they almost fixed the date but he got busy with work and had to cancel to which she got so upset. I asked him if he can share the screenshots of their messages to which he agreed.

Once the call ended I called her and confronted her. She got annoyed that I am continuing the same topic which we fought last night. I revealed that I got his number though his insta and we spoke. He says the exact opposite of what you said. If you want I will add him on conference. Shall I?

There was a cold silence on the other end. She said “No need for that” and cut thr call. I kept calling her but she didnt pick the call. 

Meanwhile thr screenshots came and whatever he said checks out. She was the one who kept on pestering for a meetup (are you free this evening?) and he cancelled a plan and her texts shows she was upset. She responded to a whatsapp status which apparanlty was some party (you said you had a meeting). It was meeting come party because they achieved their targets hence a celebration. Again few words were exchanged and her last 4 messages were deleted. 

Now I got my answers. I just wanted to know the deleted 4 messages. And guess what it was?

> I regret liking you

I kept on callimg her for an hour but she didnt pick up. Later she called me back to which i said “No need to call. I got what i needed” and broke it off. She then messaged me crying and begging not to call it quits. She still hasnt confessed but maintains her stance that this was all a misunderstanding. She went apeshit with the begging, crying and suicide threats etc. A never seen before face of hers. Theres still more to it but im lazy to type them. We are no longer together and that wasnt what broke up our relationship. We continued the relationship for few more months until October 2023. If im not lazy i’ll write part 2.

1iqouw7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iqouw7,Acacia Exploiting R,"Does anyone else remember when Acacia documented every waking second of R’s heart failure diagnosis, surgery, and hospital stay, profited off of it (the highest amount of engagement she’s ever had), then used all that money within the next year to fund another baby, a move to a mini-mansion in California, the Dyson air wrap, the $400 coffee machine, endless amounts of new clothes and materialistic bullshit, and then tried to ‘cut corners’ and quickly release a stolen pack of presets to make up for her impulsive purchases, got caught and ran off the internet, then came back acting like an insufferable child? Because I do 🤗! I thought I’d loosely compile the extent of how much she exploited her sick child since I was keeping up with the snark at the time. 

Slide Context: 
1- I tried to censor the best I could while still showing that R’s face is completely swollen in this picture, couldn’t even open her eyes, yet Caca thought it was appropriate to share on the day that it happened in damn near real time
2- Selfies in the hospital room bathroom 🤪 Her poor child looks miserable
3- Acacia made and sold a preset pack that was promoted by using R and made the ‘theme’ about her sick child’s medical situation
4- Self-explanatory 
5- Also self-explanatory, they hardly wore their masks in public 2 months into the pandemic
 6- So. Many. Posts. This ss I found focused on her being fixated on R going home for months before she was ready to (and then they went camping right after she was finally released💀)
7, 8, 9 & 10 - Both of these posts had very ‘click-baity’ captions that made literal thousands of people think that her child had passed at first glance. The second post with B had the caption start with “Our big baby just left us” before she edited it
11, 12, 13 & 14 - Sorry to include so many, but it really puts it into perspective how much this hospital stay was just one big money-making photo-op for Acacia. This poor child was having her face during her most vulnerable moments plastered onto IG almost every single day, down to showing her scar shortly after surgery
15- The captions and amount of oversharing of the entire situation that happened daily
16- Can’t be a Caca Snark post without a little ‘how do I make this about ME?’
17- “I understand that you would do the right thing and care about your children. I have different views ❤️”

I’m a 29-year-old guy standing at the intersection of “What am I doing with my life?” and “Maybe this is exactly where I’m supposed to be.” If you’ve ever felt the same, let’s talk.  

I’m not here with a checklist or a rigid plan. Life doesn’t come with a manual, and neither do connections. So, let’s skip the formalities and start with a conversation. Who knows? Maybe we’ll write a story worth telling.  

### Here’s a glimpse of my chapter so far:  
- **Music:** My playlist is a mix of soulful, introspective, and eclectic tracks. Lately, I’ve been looping songs like *New Magic Wand - Tyler The Creator*, *The weekend - Open hearts*, and *Diamond Boy - SZA*. If music is your language, we’ll vibe.  
- **Health:** 2023 was a wake-up call. I’ve been hitting the gym, eating clean, and prioritizing sleep. But I also believe in balance—getting high once in a while to just *be*.  
- **Hobbies:** Cooking is my therapy (I make a mean pasta), coffee is my love language (dark roast, no sugar), and art is my escape (psychedelic art speaks to my soul).  
- **Humor:** Dark, witty, and a little awkward. If you can laugh at existential dread, we’re already friends.  
- **Travel:** Long hikes and spontaneous trips are my happy place. Bonus if you’re into deep conversations under the stars.  

### What I’m looking for:  
- A kind, nurturing soul who’s okay with my occasional silences (I’m working on it, I promise).  
- Someone who’s passionate about *something*—art, poetry, music, or even their morning coffee ritual.  
- A connection that feels natural, where we can talk about everything and nothing.  
- Bonus if you’re into Arsenal (I need emotional support) or if you can teach me to appreciate something new.  

### Why you should DM me:  
- If you’ve ever wanted to talk about life’s big questions over coffee or a joint.  
- If you’re looking for someone who’ll listen, laugh, and maybe even write you a terrible poem.  
- If you’re curious about where this could go—no pressure, just possibilities.  

Let’s start with a “hi” and see where the story takes us. Worst case? We have an awkward conversation. Best case? We create something beautiful.  

P.S. If you’ve read this far, you’re already my kind of person. Don’t overthink it—just say hello. 😊

A few markers, even.  And a button on the wall (low enough to reach, high enough that you won't press it accidentally).

You are informed that you can repeat the last 24 hours (starting half an hour before you last woke up from a sleep of at least an hour), with minor modifications, until you are satisfied with it and press the button.

During the actual loop, you will not remember that you are in a loop, other than (if you loop a bunch of times) a faint subliminal sense of deja vu.  But after each loop, you will come to this room for up to an hour, and have some choices to make.

First, you need to decide if you want to remember the last loop or not.  If you decide to forget it, it will be erased from memory before you come to the room again.  If not, you will remember it whenever you are in the room, and after you press the button.

Then, you are allowed to make one tweak to the day (compared to the original day), and keep up to 2 previous tweaks.  Tweaks need to be small changes that could reasonably have happened, such as ""X did/'nt forget to set an alarm"" (where X can be you or anyone you interacted with that day), ""X decided to/not to stop for coffee on the way to work"", ""the cat coughed up a hairball in the kitchen instead of on the carpet"", ""it started raining 5 minutes earlier/later"", ""X is in a good mood"", and so on.

You can't pick things like specific lottery numbers (unless you legitimately have a few ""standard"" lucky numbers you go for), but you can decide to buy/not buy a lottery ticket from a specific place or the like.  You also can't supply yourself with specific dialogue for an encounter or the like.  Basically, the tweaks should be things the target's subconscious could ""tell"" them in a single short sentence.

Further, tweaks to anyone else need to be in character for them. You can't make your tightfisted boss suddenly give you a super generous raise, for example.

You can also make any notes you care to, and can bring up to a standard ream of paper back with you after you press the button.

If you die in a loop, you will wake up in the room immediately after.

What, if anything, would you try to achieve with your loops, and/or the time outside of time in the white room?  Roughly how many loops do you think you would do before you pressed the button?  Any other thoughts?",1,1739698774.0,hypotheticalsituation,1,1.0,False

The right leg has gotten slightly better. I massaged the problem area above the back of my knee a lot and it was very painful. It somewhat seemed to dissolve and then I noticed it reappeared in my calf muscle.

— we also made dessert together, but I forgot to take a photo 💀 It was basically the same concept as a Japanese coffee jello milk drink and a parfait; Destiny Island inspired 🏝️ So, bottom layer was blueberry jello, middle layer was some foamed milk and the entire Japanese lotte  'COOLish' ice cream packet, top layer was crushed lilikoi (passion fruit) flavored shortbread cookies from a local bakery and chopped fresh mango. 

Not a lot of time was spent into planning and we're no pro chefs, but I do hope you enjoy and I hope you all have a safe and happy weekend! 🌺

What should my next move be?,"Sorry for the length: After many years of being single and out of the dating scene, got into it over the last year. Like many, suffered through the apps. Had some matches and made contact outside the apps, but nothing stuck and never got dates (my best attempts ended shortly with them cancelling, me realizing it's going nowhere, and eventually they just ghosted me.) My lack of experience and other personal misgivings prevented me from acting in ""the real world"" for awhile, but eventually I started going to singles nights etc.

About 2 weeks ago, in one of these events, I had a hard time finding my footing (especially after a trying day at work) and looked for any excuse to leave early. I got lost in a group conversation and before deciding to wait once and for all, changed my mind and found a quiet corner for myself. Right then a nice lady came to me and started a conversation. To my surprise, it went really well and I thought we were vibing. It improved my night and day, and before parting ways we swiped numbers.

Don't know if it was too early, but I didn't want to miss a good thing and the next day texted her and asked if she'd like to continue our conversation, either texting or meet for a coffee. She agreed. It was right before the weekend and she was going to visit her family out of town, but we set a date for Saturday evening upon her return. The date went pretty well, more friendly than romantic, but we're still getting to know each other. I think we share many similar personality traits, so I'm okay with that. However, after the date I had a gut feeling she didn't really find romantic/relationship potential in me and was too nice to turn me down.I said I had my misgivings, and possibly my inexperience is at play here too, so any small detail or interaction causes my mind to work overtime. I'm very intuitive, but my intuitions could also be wrong and be affected by my own fears. I try to convince myself to chill and not expect too much from this, just let it play out. But it's still hard not to be affected by all this.

Anyway, for the next couple of days we kept in touch, spoke on the phone once (later she admitted she prefers texting and voice messages, so I respected her choice of communication). Managed to set another, casual date last Thursday evening, accompanying her when she walked her dog in a park next to her home, and ended at a coffee place. I brought her a gift, something I promised to get her in advance. She was hesitant to take it, but I insisted and after the date she thanked me over text.

As for the date itself, I think I was way more open than her, especially with my personal life and feelings (which is usually I find hard to do, but I'm to get her to know and like me.) A friend advised me to bring up her relationship prospects and romantic histories. Didn't do the latter, but I found interest in her expectations and agreed with many of them. Later I realized she never asked me back about mine. And again, I feel I was more open in our conversations. In fact, aside from picking the sites for our dates, so far I was the initiator, even of all of our interactions.

She went on a small trip over the weekend and I'm waiting for her to make contact, maybe make plans together. I've decided to let her do the next move this round, p\[robably wait another day or two before I contact her myself. Even considered letting her know my thoughts. Perhaps she's just timid or unsure of what to do next, and I just need to give her time. Maybe it's too early of a stage to think like that? I don't know, never been in this situation before.",2,1739698464.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I am currently on the fence buying a new jura. I can’t decide between the S8 and the E8. I watched a lot of reviews and videos. 3 things make think that the S8 might be better. 

1. The latte macchiato (which is my favorite) on the E8 seems a bit off. In a review video it seems that the milk and the coffee are somehow mixing together. It should be Foam/coffee/milk. At 19:30 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUX\_7EJP74A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUX_7EJP74A)  
2. I read a lot about the E8 that the drinks are a bit too cold. Is that a known issue?

3. Made in Switzerland. The S8 is manufactured in switzerland. Is this some kind of better quality control?

It turns out that I have boy problems, which means that I'm very bad at understanding the intentions that men have.

context:

A couple of years ago (I think I was like 17, im 22 now) I was in a group (not the same group from the previous post) and when I was just getting to know them, one of them (21m) became my friend VERY quickly, which I thought -great, it wasn't that hard to make friends- obviously a very naive thought on my part, he always invited me to all the meetings they had and I always joined in or we always ended up having very deep talks with him, what happened with him was that at a meeting for Friend's Day they brought a game to get drunk and everything went very wrong, some of them threw up in the yard, others broke a toilet while he and I, very drunk, were kissing in his house, as I was aware of the situation I didn't let it get any ""worse"" and from that night on, he didn't talk to me anymore...

I thought -what did I do? What did I say? - He had gone to study somewhere far away and I was left without answers, a couple of months later he came back and wrote to me again to get together and go out to the club, that night we also kissed repeatedly and then on other outings the following days, also the times we went out he would grab my hand and be all loving with me and I would be like an idiot at his feet, until one night when he was home alone he invited me to do ""netflix and chill"", obviously it wasn't for that,  but I said no (if you know what i mean) and stayed to sleep anyway, it was veeeery uncomfortable and the next morning it was worse and since that day he never wrote to me again.

I don't know, am i dumb because now it seems super obvious to me what his objective was with me because I've already grown up xd but back then my third eye wasn't good for this. Help a few days ago he wrote to me again but I don't think it was just to have a ""coffee"" the difference now is that im mature enough to understand the situation.",1,1739697756.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I'm a long-term traveler and started to heavily use ChatGPT, Bard, Claude and DeepSeek when they came out in the last 2 years but one issue I'm still facing is the aggregation of data for traveling.   
  
I'm often searching for stuff like ""best black coffee in the [insert area]"" or ""food to gain weight in [insert area]"" or diverse stuff for traveling. Gemini should technically be the best AI to use as it's connected to the Google infrastructure but the output is often different shops in a list of like 15 with links to maps or a generated map that can't be exported. Clicking all those ex. 15 links is okay on PC but quite annoying on the phone and takes a lot of time and doesn't really help me be more productive than manual inputting it into maps directly.    
  
I'd love for Gemini to be able to create custom sets of markers you could import into GMaps, which is as of now (in my knowledge) not possible.   
  
Are there any tips how to use Gemini in those cases and especially which model to use? Currently using Flash 2 Exp with Apps for this but not sure if this is the right approach.

It was rainy. It was always rainy. Heavy clumps of rain that almost disguised themselves as snow came down, slushing on the floor. A heavy, dry knot—not in the sense that the ground wasn’t wet, but in the sense that there was no feeling in the rain. There was no emotion, just rain itself, perpetually pouring on the ground and soaking everything around it into the same dry emptiness, like it was being sucked into the void. People were too busy in their lives to worry about the actions going on in the small town, the blinking bright yellow being the only real color on the street this morning. A newspaper boy with an umbrella, drenched but deflecting the wet rain away, called out, “Breaking news! Man dies in car accident on eastbound bridge! Read about it! Read about it! Get news, get your news!”

Marcus was too busy trying to keep himself dry to bother reading anything about the news. He had gotten pretty pissed off recently reading the papers because it was all just extra clammy claptrap about the Cold War and how the Soviets were doing more unnecessary things—it was all just bullshit. He was tired of reading about it, tired of dealing with it. Especially being here at the Naval Academy, where everything was heightened. Sailors were eager to go out and fight, even though there were no wars. Everybody was on edge, particularly the loyalists in town, the ones on the city council. They were all anti-communist, of course, but they took it too far. There would be rallies in the park where they would hold signs or march into traffic, and it got to the point where it was like—what are we doing? We’re the same country, we obviously know we’re against the Soviets, so why are you marching in the street like it’s going to make a difference? Like we don’t already realize there’s a problem? It’s like shouting, ""The ship is sinking!"" when it’s already halfway submerged and people are jumping off. There’s nothing you can do about it. If you’re so concerned about what’s happening halfway across the world, how about you send a missile yourself if you think you have so much power?

Sometimes Marcus would sit in on the city council meetings just to hear what they were talking about, to see if they would bring up anything actually important about the town—like the failing roads and crumbling infrastructure. But no, the only topic was the Cold War. ""Oh, we need to up our preparations. We should build bomb shelters. Oh, we, the citizens—blah blah blah."" Get out of here with that fever.

This morning wasn’t really for politics. It was for an informational research meeting with Dr. Eisenhower Ebar from the local university. He was supposed to talk about his physics project with him. More times than not, they would end up talking about random stuff. It was already three weeks into his project, and it was due in two weeks. He needed to get it done. He needed to write a paper on the Theory of Acceleration—rather, not acceleration in the sense of starting at one point and going to another, but terminal velocity, its factors, and how it all worked. His best shot at really understanding this, besides just reading textbooks and throwing coins off buildings, was actually talking to a doctor. But not just any doctor. You see, this guy was from Germany. He served in World War II, and he’d seen the nastiest shit any man could see. So yes, he might have a jaded perspective—one that isn’t always credible—but Marcus always lived by one rule: you never judge a man by his past, only by his actions.

A car zipped by, buzzing him out of his thoughts. It was a red pickup truck hauling a trailer full of pigs. Poor pigs, they had to suffer out here in the rain while getting hauled away. At least get them a goddamn cover. He walked around the corner and saw the coffee shop where he was supposed to meet Ebar. There was an outside seating area, but obviously, no one was out there because of the rain. It was a small shop with a big black canvas over the glass door. The wood creaked as he pushed it open, a door chime ringing softly. A single man stood behind the counter, working with old-fashioned brewing machines that looked like they were from the 1930s. The inside was dimly lit by low-hanging lamps, and there was a bookshelf in the left corner. He liked that.

At the second table behind a couple that was way too well-dressed for the weather sat the doctor. He was in an all-brown tweed coat with high black leather boots, a wet umbrella resting by his chair. He was sipping on an espresso, lowering his sunglasses to look at Marcus. Why was this guy wearing sunglasses when it was raining outside? There was no sun. Man was slick. Blonde hair—the stereotypical look—but the guy had a little bit of mystique to him. He had been in a pretty bad incident, scarring on the right side of his face leaving him blind in one eye. Not in a gnarly way, but just subtle enough to tell you he’d been through some shit. The kind of thing where you don’t ask, because you’re too afraid of the answer. It could be, ""Oh, I got into a car crash."" Or it could be, ""Oh, I was in a nuclear war."" You never ask. You just assume they’ve seen some things and leave it at that.

He raised his hand and waved Marcus over. “Hallo! Mein Freund! Come! You look good.”

The man was in his mid-fifties, but somehow looked only thirty. He was fit, and he knew how to dress. Maybe dressing well deducted twenty years as long as you kept up with the latest fashion. Marcus wasn’t much of a fashion geek himself. He always just wore whatever was comfortable, which usually meant a thick jean jacket, brown pants, and some warm sneakers. He was a broke college student, of course. He couldn’t afford fancy things. The most luxurious thing he owned was a pocket watch from his grandpa, supposedly from the 18th century. He never got it fully appraised, so he didn’t even know if it was real.

Cookies & cream x Karel's haze 

Exp 31/1/26

Morning strain for pain relief, IBS stomach related issues.

This is one of my favourite go to budget strains. I find it perfect for waking up and having a vape with a coffee and it sets me up for the morning.
I generally try to get it whenever it's in stock, so as soon as I saw this was back I ordered some.

When I opened the bag I was met with no smell whatsoever, like literally nothing not even a hay type smell. Usually I get something but this batch nothing.
I've had it in a jar with a boveda since Thursday and it has quite a punchant smell to it thankfully.

The taste though was not affected at all, it still has that lovely creamy nutty taste from the first inhale. It's got better as the smell has improved and I think this batch is probably the nicest tasting so far.

The buds are all mids in size, not too big or small and feels fresh and has a long expiry date. It is dry but not overly dry and grinds up quite fluffy rather than to dust. It's quite sticky too when it's been ground up. 

If you are looking for a budget daytime strain, you can't go wrong at £5.50 a gram.

I enjoy marketing itself but feel like I lack the skills to stand out in such a competitive field. I was lucky to get this job as the pay is decent, in the sense that similar roles I’ve found pay £3000 less a year (approx).

I have a degree in paramedic science but didn’t pursue that path because shift work was too difficult for me. I later discovered a talent for marketing in an office job, but now, after six months in my full time marketing role (and five months of job searching), I feel lost. I’ve applied for lots of marketing roles and have not been successful in any of them.

Recently, I came across a Probation Services Officer role that really interests me. It ties somewhat into my paramedic background, offers better pay, clear career progression, and a manageable commute. However, my partner worries I’m just looking for an escape and will end up unhappy again (and I completely see his point).

I’ve been offered an interview and genuinely believe I’d be great at the role—I was a strong paramedic because I’m empathetic, kind, and resilient. But I feel guilty and uncertain about leaving marketing behind and also stepping into something entirely brand new again.

What do you think? Am I making the right move? ",1,1739696747.0,UKJobs,14,0.6,False

I've just started drinking saffron tea, and I have to say—it's more than I could have dreamed. I'd heard of saffron, naturally—some kind of foodie gourmet spice—but not that it's full of some serious healthy good stuff when you steep it as a tea.

Saffron has long been a Persian, Indian, and Middle Eastern favorite, not only for its color and aroma but also because it has healing properties. Saffron tea differs from green tea or black tea because it's naturally caffeine-free, making it a perfect choice for an individual who needs a warm drink but does not desire the jitters.

Why People Love Saffron Tea
Post-study (and frequent consumption of the same), I have understood a few reasons why saffron tea is becoming popular:

 Mood Enhancer & Stress Relief – Some studies opine that saffron may raise the level of serotonin, which might be beneficial for mild depression and anxiety. To the best of my knowledge, I do feel relaxed after drinking, as if a stress-killer effect.


 Relief from Bloating – Saffron has been used for centuries to calm bloating and improve digestion. Taken after meals, it's also easy on the stomach and may even aid in gut health.

 Overflowing in Antioxidants – Saffron is rich with crocin and safranal, two powerful chemicals that repress inflammation and oxidative stress. Others even use it on their skin and as an anti-aging cream.

 Promotes Better Sleep – I discovered that having saffron tea at night calms me down and gets me ready for bed. There is some research that suggests it can naturally increase melatonin levels.

 Energy Without the Crash – Saffron tea gives a subtle energy boost over coffee. It's ideal for someone who needs to remain productive without jitters.

How to Make Saffron Tea at Home
The best part? It's not really difficult to make saffron tea. This is my routine:

 Boil water.
 Put 3–5 good-quality saffron threads and steep it for 5–10 minutes.
 Optional: Add honey, cinnamon, or lemon for extra flavor.
 Enjoy a golden, cozy glass of saffron tea!

Where to Get Good Saffron
Not all saffrons are of equal quality. Low-quality or dyed ones are being mixed with dyes to look colorfully rich. If you never tried saffron tea before, my recommendation is the pure high-grade saffron with rich reddish strands.

I'm 35 male, single and in between jobs. I wont say much about my current company apart that I'm paid to assemble chairs. I'm skinny, I take care of my hygiene but I'm a 4/10 at best.

Almost a year ago I started working for this company and about 3 months after joining, a girl, who works in the office department and also uses the same bus to commute as me, decides to greet me for the first time. I can still remember it now, she was about 5 meters in front of me and suddenly turns around, smiling, wishing me a great day and a good work. I had seen this girl before but never really thought much about her, only that she was pretty and elegant but that was it. Unfortunately the moment she did that, out sympathy from her part of course, I felt very special and instantly fell in love.

Months go by but I never muster the courage to speak to her, apart from greetings and such, even when waiting at the bus stop at the end of the day. I had two great opportunities to talk to her, one in the summer and one recently on the holidays, when we were alone, just the two of us, waiting for the bus back home for 40 minutes. It was unbearable because she didn't seem to want to talk and I didn't want to overstepped her space with small talk.

After the new year, I decided one day that I would introduce myself properly, but when I spoke to her and wished a great new year, she, who seemed to be texting someone has she was smiling to herself, turn to me and gave me a brief and disinterested ""Thanks"". I don't know if I managed to hide my disappointment, I think I did, but luckily I immediately turn around to another colleague besides me to talk about as not to appear awkward.

Ever since that day she gradually started avoiding me when exiting the bus, from leaving through the second exit further back to only leaving her seat when I'm stepping outside the bus, I could notice this from me periphery. Nowadays she avoids the same bus entirely and probably wakes earlier to pick the one to leaves 15 minutes prior.

It all still hurts, especially I've always prouded myself of getting along with other and trying to strengthen social relationships, be it at work or otherwise. I'm sure I never directly offended her and even when I noticed her, during commute or during lunch, I was always careful to not stare like a creep, I don't know...

Now I mostly just avoid her or fake indifference, which I'm not proud of and think that has probably worsen the situation as she now avoids her gaze when we pass by and generally feels like she is in discomfort.

I managed to know her name through another colleague of hers who is almost in his retirement and also that she is Colombian. I also notice that she is hitting a guy from the same department since one day she exited the table where she was eating with her female coworkers to pick coffee and sit on the table directly behind me where three dudes were eating and has done so, with one of them, until recently.

I haven't been able to sleep properly for the past few weeks now. I know that I have to move on with my life but it's been real difficult. I've never felt as miserable like this. 

Do you think it's worth having a talk with her, given we never really talked before this, at least to appease any discomfort she might feel about me?

I'm not hoping for much, I know I'm not her type but I don't want her to get anxious about going to work because of me, especially given she has probably left everything behind in her home country to start a new life here.

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text, I'm not really used to this. Just wanted to vent a bit and give context to anyone willing to read this. Thanks for your time. 🙂",1,1739696509.0,AskMenRelationships,0,1.0,False

  CENTURY 756.3, THE REALM OF MIDDLE-NARNIARTH

  Zentrous the horrid looked upon the pile of slain elves, dwarves, and dryads with glee... or was it contempt? 

  This campaign had taken centuries, a very slow build up to a fitting conclusion. ""Nobody thought it was possible, no, evil never triumphs. Well, you bastards, if that is so, then it was not I who was evil"" he thought out loud. 

  No, this would not do. His demonic army deserved a better soliloquy, right? A more fitting speech? The bodies were stacked ten high, and his men fought ravenously. The thousand or so of them that still breathed looked upon him longingly, this war was all they had ever known. They needed closure. They needed and deserved a new direction. 

  He reached down and plucked the skull of Eviwyn from it's mangled body. Ah. He fought valiantly. And now he will be forgotten. The mighty demon lord then squeezed his hand, crushing the skull into a thousand shards.

  ""Demon spawn!"" He yelled out, ""our time has finally manifested! Eons of hiding, of being considered less than them, they are over! The lucky ones have been slain, their enslaved survivors will know only pain, they will know salted land, they will know that they...""

  His men were no longer looking upon the great demon lord, no, they were looking towards a hill, they were looking at the magus that stood upon it. He stood there, glowing radiant, despite his robes being covered in the blood of himself and his fellow men. Despite him being slain only minutes ago, he was standing. 

   The wizard said nothing. His mortal wounds still open, his viscera clearly visible, yet he remained stoic. Solemn even, as he raised his staff skyward and pointed at Zentrous with the other shaking hand.

  A bolt of blue left the poisoned sky and met the sorcerer's staff as his eyes glowed a similar blue, and then the man simply collapsed. It was harrowing for a moment, but then the sky cleared, and the demon army cheered at this last failed attempt. Then they gasped.

  A pinhole of light formed over the demon lord, and he began to... unravel. The very strings, the fibers of his existence snaked up slowly towards the hole in reality. 

  Zentrous only felt static, only saw flashes. He looked down at his hands and saw them fade in and out, the skin becoming translucent and only showing bone, and then a flash back to normal. And then nothing. For a short time, there was only nothing.

  The demon lord could neither hear nor see, but he could feel. He was burning. Was this hell? Would hell take such a beast as him? Nonsense, that realm was his next conquest! This was something different. He felt something else, a feeling he forgot. Fear. He was afraid. He was alone and he was burning and he was afraid.

   And then light. Bright, burning light, he was in a tunnel of fire, surrounded on all sides by darkness. He screamed through the agony, and noticed a flock of iron birds ahead of him. One more moment of torment, as he thought  ""What had that blasted wizard done in his final moments?"" And then nothing.

SPACEDATE 42356.2, EPSILON QUADRANT, NEUTRAL SPACE 

   Lyngnar looked at the com display. Twelve Yavik ships were approaching, yet the alarms never sounded. ""Captain.. we have a problem I believe"" he said, fairly puzzled. The captain, a fairly dashing example of a Trinian, looked annoyed. He was flirting with an intern, a wonderful slab of a Nethim,  this interruption was very poorly timed.

  He yelled out ""what, ensign? What could be so fucking important? We are out in open space, neutral space at that. This had better not be another of one of your false alarms. Well? Get on with it .. we are waiting.""

  Ensign Lyngnar expanded his display to the main. ""Look sir!"" He exclaimed, ""twelve Yavik destroyers! Obviously on a direct course! We are so fucked! This isn't a war vessel!""

   The captain scratched his chin, then winked at the intern, saying ""maneuver us into radio range. Don't bother priming the plasma cannons, no reason to come off as aggressive. We are no threat to them. I'm sure they are just passing through.""

  The helmsman, Neery, reluctantly edged the ship forward into radio range as the captain requested. He was failing at remaining unemotional, the yellow sweat dripping from his brow, clashing with his almost clear skin, it was a telltale sign that a Mervick was nervous.

  ""Calm your tits, Neer. If they wanted us dead, we wouldn't be speaking right now. Get yourself together, there are women in here, don't be such a bitch"" the captain exclaimed as he did a really cringe finger gun at the intern. She giggled. The other women on the bridge were not amused. What the fuck was an intern doing on the bridge anyway?

   ""Salutations, Yavik fleet. This is Captain Stymm of the NSS Salvation, we seem to have crossed paths"".

   There was only silence. The dregs of the great Yavik hive mind remained quiet, choosing to arrange the ships into an inverted pyramid instead of answering.

  ""Sir! That's an attack formation!"" yelled out the main security officer, following with ""orders, sir?""
   
   The captain finally got his head into the game and stood up, yelling ""charge the main weapons, put all power towards the shields! Prepare for evasive maneuvers, drop into hyperspace at the first opportunity!""

  ""We can't do all of those things, you idiot!"", the helmsman yelled out, the captain staring at him blankly... almost hurt. Neery followed with ""we can't charge the shields, FTL, and primary weaponry at the same time, sir! Fucking pick one!""

   The captain, sulkingly blurted out ""God, no need to be a dick about it. Umm... FTL I guess. Let's get the hell out of here, am I right? Heh..."" Neery stood up slowly and smacked himself in the forehead, his fear slowly leaving as a strange, calm anger began to take hold. He then walked over to the now seated Captain, standing over him, and said through his teeth ""power the shields. We do not have time to charge the capacitors for a warp jump. If we survive the initial barrage, we can then put effort into leaving"". He then stomped back to the helm and took a swig off of his flask, his hand on some lever, waiting for the proper moment to pull it.

  ""Umm...yeah, engineering, do what he said.  Solid idea. Do that, now"" squeaked from the captain's mouth. The green shield surrounded the ship as twelve disruptor beams hit simultaneously, the ship quaking violently.

  The captain stared at his hands, realized he still had them, and regained some confidence, finally saying ""damage report, and then get us out of here!""

  Lyngnar started laughing. This was never good. ""Damage report? Sir? Really? Alrighty. The fucking starboard power bank is destroyed. See that little glowy bit on that projection of the Salvation in front of us all? That's the part they blew up. It shows it right there, you know, SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO FUCKING ASK US! JUST FUCKING LOOK, YOU TIT! WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE BECAUSE YOU WERE TRYING TO GET LAID! EVERYONE AT THE ACADEMY WARNED ME ABOUT TAKING THIS ASSIGNMENT! WHY DIDN'T I LISTEN?""

  Lyngnar smiled and then calmly walked over to the helm and snatched the flask from his associate, pounding down the remaining contents in three swigs. He then looked up at the main screen and calmly said ""oh, look, they are charging their disruptors again. We have about 30 seconds before we blow up. Probably don't have enough power to run the coffee pot at this point. Ion thrusters might be able to get us to a fraction of ramming speed. Anyone else down? Maybe take out a daycare or something on one of their ships? No? Well I'm out of ideas. Captain? No? Nothing? Awesome. I'm leaving. If we aren't in a thousand chunks after the next hit, I'll be in the bathroom looking at anime porn"". He then walked off of the bridge, flipping the captain off with his three fingered hand. 

  The next hit was obviously bigger than the last, Neery had engineering divert some power towards the shields despite the lack of orders, and the display showed that the port side power bank was also destroyed. The enemy was systematically taking out the important systems in order, as a proper hive mind military does. He chuckled as he said ""Well. That was it. We are running on auxiliary now. Orders?""

   ""I have an idea"" said a voice over the intercom. It's source showed to be engineering. ""Who is that?"" asked the captain. ""It sounds like Rhonda"" said Luxx, the communications officer, adding ""she's the janitor in engineering"". 

   The captain had that look on his face, you know the one, as he said ""A human? What the shit is a human going to do? They aren't particularly smart, they have no claws, they seem to think that the pristine oasis of a planet they live on is a deathworld... Despite the fact that you can throw a dart in their solar system and hit an inhospitable asteroid teeming with life... Tell me, great janitor, what is your grand plan? Are we going to launch a plunger at them?""

   Rhonda casually laughed, then coughed. She was obviously smoking. Ever since humans joined the alliance and learned about DNA nano printers all they did was chain-smoke, like constantly.

   ""I've engaged a little project of mine, sir. You now have enough power to run the shields at trifold capacity. That should blow them up, I know, but it won't"", she said. Sure enough, seconds later the shields glowed a shade of green so bright it was seen thirty light years away, the disruptor beams merely bouncing off at random angles. The ship took zero damage that time. 

   ""HOW THE FUCK DID YOU DO THAT?"" questioned the captain. Rhonda responded ""well, sir, our lore tells of a man who designed a zero point energy generator. It pulls power from the very aether of existence. I've been working on it on my off-time. We've always had an idea of how to build it, but up until now I didn't think the components existed in a semi-modular form. Imagine my shock when I looked into the service manuals and found that I only had to reconfigure the food replicator. Now, I don't think it actually does what Nikola thought, I believe it's more of a temporal displacement furnace"" The captain, rather perplexed, asked ""what in the actual fuck does any of that mean?""

  Rhonda thought for a second, then responed with ""well, sir, it seems to pull matter from adjacent realities and converts them to energy... as far as I can tell. Anyhoo, I'm going to send, I don't know, four thousand triterra watts to the forward cannon? Is that enough?""

   ""Was that a scream?"" asked Larry, the assistant janitor, also human, as he powered up the device. Rhonda shrugged her shoulders and said ""I'm not sure. It does seem to make sounds like that when we power it up. Weird, right? Anyway, Larry, fire the plasma cannons. Yeah, just touch the screen where you want to hit, I'd go with the furthest ship"".

  The main cannon erupted with the single brightest ball of plasma ever seen before or since. It was so large, the Yavik ship not only exploded, but it exploded into plasma shrapnel, causing a chain reaction among the entire Yavik battalion, destroying all of them in a cascade of satisfying chaos, later made famous by a Norwegian deathcore band in the song ""Domino of destruction"". The music video featured footage from the actual event, and if you looked close enough, the beam almost seemed to have a face (that image appeared on countless social media pages, especially in reposts on the ""things with faces"" group on Spacebook).

   There was one final scream from the temporal furnace as the Salvation dropped into warp to evade the deluge of beautifully dangerous plasmids that were quickly spreading through the entire sector.

  Rhonda pulled it off. The ship was safe, it could now continue on its mission of delivering its cargo of novelty gag gifts to the clown college on Skoopy 17.


    1985, THE CLOUD REALM OF LOVE-A-LOT


  The skeleton army stood opposite of the happy-bears, it was to be the epic final showdown between good and evil. A battle cry from the skeleton king echoed through the mountains of the realm of love-a-lot as they charged forward, their swords drawn and awaiting to finally taste the sweet stuffing of their chipper adversaries.

   The bears followed suit, the symbols on their bellies glowing, charging with the ultimate power, the power of love. 

  Kissy-heart bear, the one the other happy-bears considered to be the unofficial figurehead, charged his stomach sigil beyond capacity with the undying deep affection of himself and his close friends, an amalgam of love and devotion as he screamed out ""happy-bears! Spread the lo....""

  And then he promptly disappeared into nothingness.

1iqo9tk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iqo9tk/a_town_full_of_headless_people/,A Town Full of Headless People,"There were four of us, heading back home from another town after attending one of our friends' weddings. It was a fun trip until we got kind of lost because it was our first time passing through that road.

We planned to stop for a while to ask for directions from the people in the neighborhood, but during the ride, we hadn’t seen anyone yet.

It was a small-town road, and it was quiet. We barely saw any other vehicles passing by, no matter what kind.

Then, we encountered a road sign with a town’s name written on it.

“What do you guys think about stopping by? It’s getting dark,” Morgan, who was driving, asked us. “I don’t mind driving through the night, but we need food. And a little rest.”

“Oh, I agree,” Elsa responded.

Morgan turned the wheel toward the town. It was quite a long journey from the highway until we finally saw the town’s houses. Strangely enough, the closer we got to the town, the quieter and eerier it felt.

“This town seems empty,” Amelia muttered. “Is it abandoned? We won’t find any place to rest here, let alone food.”

“Should we try knocking on a door or two?” I asked. “We could try. We’re here anyway.”

“It wouldn’t hurt to try,” Morgan responded. “Like you said, Danny, we’re here anyway.”

Morgan stopped in front of a house, and I hopped out of the car.

I looked around.

The town sure felt creepy and eerie, for whatever reason.

Something urged me to get things done as soon as possible. I immediately walked toward the house Morgan had stopped in front of.

I knocked on the door once. No response.

I knocked again, twice. Still no response.

“Excuse me? Is anyone around?” I called out. As I accidentally pulled the doorknob, I saw it creak open.

“Excuse me?” I called out again, peeking inside the house. I knew it was rude, but the door accidentally opened.

Yet, still, no response.

I was about to give up, close the door, and return to the car when I noticed something. As I opened the door wider, I saw a framed picture of a family of four hanging on the wall, right across from where I stood.

Intrigued by what I saw, I subconsciously walked inside the house.

“Danny, what the hell, man? Don’t just walk inside!” I heard Elsa shout from the car.

But my eyes were fixated on the framed picture. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. But they weren’t.

“Danny! Danny! Dude, come on out! What are you doing? If the homeowner catches you, we’ll be in deep trouble!” Morgan called out, panicking. He jumped out of the car, followed by Elsa and Amelia, trying to pull me back outside.

“Guys,” I said to them, “is it just me, or do you see that too?”

I pointed toward the framed picture hanging on the wall, just a few meters from where we stood.

The picture showed a family portrait of five members. It looked like the mother, the father, an adult child, a son or daughter-in-law, and a baby girl.

All five of them wore dresses and tuxedos, but something was strange about the picture.

All five family members were headless.

It wasn’t like the picture was cropped at the neck. We could see the tips of their necks, but no heads were visible.

None.

“What the fuck is that?” Morgan muttered.

“Is that some kind of inside joke?” Amelia wondered.

“Could be,” I replied, “but that would be cruel and inappropriate, wouldn’t it? Especially to cut off the baby girl’s head in the picture too?”

“We better get out,” Morgan said.

And we did.

We jumped back in the car and continued down the town’s road, hoping to find someone to ask for help or at least a store to buy food from.

Along the road, we passed by quite a few pictures with people in them.

We saw an election billboard with the name Clayton written on it and a picture of someone wearing a shirt and tie. We could see the tip of the man’s neck, but there was no head on top of it.

We saw advertising posters, housing commercials, and many other images featuring people, but none had heads attached to their necks.

All of those people were headless.

“What is this place?” Amelia muttered.

“Morgan, watch out!” Elsa screamed in panic, pointing toward the road. There, right in front of our car, was a dog crossing the street.

The dog didn’t have a head on top of its neck.

But it walked across the road as if nothing was wrong.

Then, we saw a house nearby with its door creaking open. Someone walked out wearing pajamas.

But there was no head on their neck.

Seconds later, another door opened, then another, and another. One by one, the people of the town walked out of their houses into the middle of the road, right in front of our car.

There were about twenty-something people standing before us.

None of them had heads.

They were all headless.

All of them.

“Morgan!” I shouted in horror.

Those headless people stood before our car, blocking our path. Morgan quickly turned the wheel around, heading back the way we came from. He floored the gas pedal, pushing the car to its top speed.

No one seemed to get in the way as we drove full speed back to the highway. It should have been a good sign.

But it wasn’t.

The town’s road was a single, long road. If we turned around, there was no way we could get lost. Yet there we were, sitting in the car, horrified as we stared at the road ahead that was now gone.

What was supposed to be the road leading back to the highway was now a dead end with a deep forest in sight.

“Did we miss an intersection?” Morgan asked.

“There wasn’t even an intersection!” Elsa replied, terrified.

“We came into the town from this one-way road,” I said. “Now the road is gone. How the hell did that happen?”

We all turned around to see countless headless inhabitants blocking our way back.

Meanwhile, in front of our car, the forest's edge seemed to be getting closer, as if it were expanding and shortening the road to the town.

“What choice do we have?” Amelia asked.

“I can still see a road back there,” Morgan responded. “We turn around and charge full speed.”

“Hitting them in the process?” Elsa asked.

“Well, they don’t seem human to me. So...,” I said.

“Exactly,” Morgan agreed as he once again turned the car around and slammed the gas pedal, driving toward the headless inhabitants.

But none of them flinched.

Morgan didn’t seem to care. He hit anyone who got in his way. Through the side window, I saw red liquid splatter as Morgan crashed into them.

“What is that red stuff? Blood?” I muttered.

“So, they’re human?” Elsa asked.

“I don’t know. I don’t care,” Morgan said, keeping a straight face as he sped through the town’s eerie road.

We could still see the headless inhabitants running toward the car, trying to get in the way. But Morgan didn’t care enough to stop. He pushed through.

Some of the headless inhabitants clung to the car, trying to break the windows and grab anyone inside. Thankfully, Morgan was a great driver. He swerved, he charged, he did everything he could until they finally let go of the car.

Along the road, we saw a number of posters and photos. All of them featured people, but none of them had heads.

We didn’t know how long we had been driving, but eventually, we saw something that looked like a gate in front of us.

I looked back and saw the headless inhabitants still chasing us.

However, the moment Morgan drove past the gate, all of the inhabitants who had been relentlessly pursuing us abruptly stopped.

All of them stood still right behind the gate.

I looked closely and realized that not a single one of them stepped outside the gate.

It was as if something was preventing them from walking past it.

Whatever it was, we were just glad to be safe. None of us were hurt. It was all over.

Or so we thought.

About a week later, we gathered at our regular coffee shop. Morgan, Amelia, and I were there, waiting for Elsa.

Amelia talked about her blog, where she shared our story about a town full of headless people.

""Guess what, guys? One comment stood out,"" Amelia said.

""This guy said,"" Amelia continued, ""that he heard an urban legend about a town full of headless people. He didn’t say much, except that, according to him, the town is inhabited by humans practicing dark magic or witchcraft that lets them live for eternity.""

Amelia took a sip of her tea.

""In exchange for their heads,"" she concluded.

""So, they’re okay with having no heads as long as they live forever? Insanity!"" I exclaimed, feeling both angry and confused.

""Is that also why they didn’t step past the gate?"" Morgan asked. ""It’s their border. Once they step outside, they’re as good as dead.""

""Oh, yeah,"" Amelia replied. ""The guy said that too. And he mentioned that he was grateful we made it out alive. According to him, the legend says that whoever enters the town never leaves alive.""

""And yet, here we are, sipping coffee,"" I said, taking a sip. ""And tea,"" I added, nodding at Amelia.

""Where’s Elsa, by the way?"" Morgan asked.

""I’ve called her several times, but she hasn’t picked up,"" Amelia replied.

""Why don’t we go check on her?"" Morgan suggested.

We paid for our drinks and headed to Elsa’s apartment.

Upon arrival, we knocked on her door, but no one answered. We called her phone again. No response.

But we could hear her phone ringing from inside the apartment.

""Wait, I still have her spare key from when I stayed over after losing mine for a few days,"" Amelia said, pulling a key out of her purse and unlocking the door.

""Elsa? You here? We heard your phone ringing,"" Morgan called out as we entered.

We searched every room, but there was no sign of her. Then, we heard Amelia screaming from the bedroom. Morgan and I rushed over.

What we saw was beyond explanation.

Elsa’s body lay lifeless on her bed.

Without her head.

We gathered the courage to get closer and saw something strange. The tip of her neck was clean and smooth as if it had been like that for so long that new skin had formed.

Or worse, it looked like Elsa never had a head to begin with.

""Are you sure this is Elsa? She looks like...,"" I hesitated to continue.

""She looks like the inhabitants of that town we encountered a week ago,"" Morgan finished my sentence.

He pulled down her shirt collar, revealing a tattoo on her shoulder. It was her name, written in cursive: Elsa.

""Looks like her,"" Morgan confirmed.

We examined her body closely. There were no scars, no wounds, no blood.

We looked around her room. No blood.

Nothing. Not at all.

If someone had cut her head off, there would have been blood everywhere.

""Do you see her head anywhere?"" I asked Morgan. We looked around, feeling sick at the thought of someone hiding her head somewhere as a twisted joke.

""GUYS!"" Amelia screamed from outside the bedroom.

We ran to her as fast as we could. Amelia was pointing out the window.

Elsa’s apartment was on the ground floor, facing a small city forest across the street.

Amid the trees, three figures stood, almost hidden by the shadows.

None of them had heads on top of their necks.

One of them held something in its hand. Slowly, it lifted the object so we could see it clearly.

It was a head.

Elsa’s head.

None of the three creatures had heads, but somehow, I could see a smirk.

1iqo8ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingStrangeness/comments/1iqo8ht/a_town_full_of_headless_people/,A Town Full of Headless People,"There were four of us, heading back home from another town after attending one of our friends' weddings. It was a fun trip until we got kind of lost because it was our first time passing through that road.

We planned to stop for a while to ask for directions from the people in the neighborhood, but during the ride, we hadn’t seen anyone yet.

It was a small-town road, and it was quiet. We barely saw any other vehicles passing by, no matter what kind.

Then, we encountered a road sign with a town’s name written on it.

“What do you guys think about stopping by? It’s getting dark,” Morgan, who was driving, asked us. “I don’t mind driving through the night, but we need food. And a little rest.”

“Oh, I agree,” Elsa responded.

Morgan turned the wheel toward the town. It was quite a long journey from the highway until we finally saw the town’s houses. Strangely enough, the closer we got to the town, the quieter and eerier it felt.

“This town seems empty,” Amelia muttered. “Is it abandoned? We won’t find any place to rest here, let alone food.”

“Should we try knocking on a door or two?” I asked. “We could try. We’re here anyway.”

“It wouldn’t hurt to try,” Morgan responded. “Like you said, Danny, we’re here anyway.”

Morgan stopped in front of a house, and I hopped out of the car.

I looked around.

The town sure felt creepy and eerie, for whatever reason.

Something urged me to get things done as soon as possible. I immediately walked toward the house Morgan had stopped in front of.

I knocked on the door once. No response.

I knocked again, twice. Still no response.

“Excuse me? Is anyone around?” I called out. As I accidentally pulled the doorknob, I saw it creak open.

“Excuse me?” I called out again, peeking inside the house. I knew it was rude, but the door accidentally opened.

Yet, still, no response.

I was about to give up, close the door, and return to the car when I noticed something. As I opened the door wider, I saw a framed picture of a family of four hanging on the wall, right across from where I stood.

Intrigued by what I saw, I subconsciously walked inside the house.

“Danny, what the hell, man? Don’t just walk inside!” I heard Elsa shout from the car.

But my eyes were fixated on the framed picture. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. But they weren’t.

“Danny! Danny! Dude, come on out! What are you doing? If the homeowner catches you, we’ll be in deep trouble!” Morgan called out, panicking. He jumped out of the car, followed by Elsa and Amelia, trying to pull me back outside.

“Guys,” I said to them, “is it just me, or do you see that too?”

I pointed toward the framed picture hanging on the wall, just a few meters from where we stood.

The picture showed a family portrait of five members. It looked like the mother, the father, an adult child, a son or daughter-in-law, and a baby girl.

All five of them wore dresses and tuxedos, but something was strange about the picture.

All five family members were headless.

It wasn’t like the picture was cropped at the neck. We could see the tips of their necks, but no heads were visible.

None.

“What the fuck is that?” Morgan muttered.

“Is that some kind of inside joke?” Amelia wondered.

“Could be,” I replied, “but that would be cruel and inappropriate, wouldn’t it? Especially to cut off the baby girl’s head in the picture too?”

“We better get out,” Morgan said.

And we did.

We jumped back in the car and continued down the town’s road, hoping to find someone to ask for help or at least a store to buy food from.

Along the road, we passed by quite a few pictures with people in them.

We saw an election billboard with the name Clayton written on it and a picture of someone wearing a shirt and tie. We could see the tip of the man’s neck, but there was no head on top of it.

We saw advertising posters, housing commercials, and many other images featuring people, but none had heads attached to their necks.

All of those people were headless.

“What is this place?” Amelia muttered.

“Morgan, watch out!” Elsa screamed in panic, pointing toward the road. There, right in front of our car, was a dog crossing the street.

The dog didn’t have a head on top of its neck.

But it walked across the road as if nothing was wrong.

Then, we saw a house nearby with its door creaking open. Someone walked out wearing pajamas.

But there was no head on their neck.

Seconds later, another door opened, then another, and another. One by one, the people of the town walked out of their houses into the middle of the road, right in front of our car.

There were about twenty-something people standing before us.

None of them had heads.

They were all headless.

All of them.

“Morgan!” I shouted in horror.

Those headless people stood before our car, blocking our path. Morgan quickly turned the wheel around, heading back the way we came from. He floored the gas pedal, pushing the car to its top speed.

No one seemed to get in the way as we drove full speed back to the highway. It should have been a good sign.

But it wasn’t.

The town’s road was a single, long road. If we turned around, there was no way we could get lost. Yet there we were, sitting in the car, horrified as we stared at the road ahead that was now gone.

What was supposed to be the road leading back to the highway was now a dead end with a deep forest in sight.

“Did we miss an intersection?” Morgan asked.

“There wasn’t even an intersection!” Elsa replied, terrified.

“We came into the town from this one-way road,” I said. “Now the road is gone. How the hell did that happen?”

We all turned around to see countless headless inhabitants blocking our way back.

Meanwhile, in front of our car, the forest's edge seemed to be getting closer, as if it were expanding and shortening the road to the town.

“What choice do we have?” Amelia asked.

“I can still see a road back there,” Morgan responded. “We turn around and charge full speed.”

“Hitting them in the process?” Elsa asked.

“Well, they don’t seem human to me. So...,” I said.

“Exactly,” Morgan agreed as he once again turned the car around and slammed the gas pedal, driving toward the headless inhabitants.

But none of them flinched.

Morgan didn’t seem to care. He hit anyone who got in his way. Through the side window, I saw red liquid splatter as Morgan crashed into them.

“What is that red stuff? Blood?” I muttered.

“So, they’re human?” Elsa asked.

“I don’t know. I don’t care,” Morgan said, keeping a straight face as he sped through the town’s eerie road.

We could still see the headless inhabitants running toward the car, trying to get in the way. But Morgan didn’t care enough to stop. He pushed through.

Some of the headless inhabitants clung to the car, trying to break the windows and grab anyone inside. Thankfully, Morgan was a great driver. He swerved, he charged, he did everything he could until they finally let go of the car.

Along the road, we saw a number of posters and photos. All of them featured people, but none of them had heads.

We didn’t know how long we had been driving, but eventually, we saw something that looked like a gate in front of us.

I looked back and saw the headless inhabitants still chasing us.

However, the moment Morgan drove past the gate, all of the inhabitants who had been relentlessly pursuing us abruptly stopped.

All of them stood still right behind the gate.

I looked closely and realized that not a single one of them stepped outside the gate.

It was as if something was preventing them from walking past it.

Whatever it was, we were just glad to be safe. None of us were hurt. It was all over.

Or so we thought.

About a week later, we gathered at our regular coffee shop. Morgan, Amelia, and I were there, waiting for Elsa.

Amelia talked about her blog, where she shared our story about a town full of headless people.

""Guess what, guys? One comment stood out,"" Amelia said.

""This guy said,"" Amelia continued, ""that he heard an urban legend about a town full of headless people. He didn’t say much, except that, according to him, the town is inhabited by humans practicing dark magic or witchcraft that lets them live for eternity.""

Amelia took a sip of her tea.

""In exchange for their heads,"" she concluded.

""So, they’re okay with having no heads as long as they live forever? Insanity!"" I exclaimed, feeling both angry and confused.

""Is that also why they didn’t step past the gate?"" Morgan asked. ""It’s their border. Once they step outside, they’re as good as dead.""

""Oh, yeah,"" Amelia replied. ""The guy said that too. And he mentioned that he was grateful we made it out alive. According to him, the legend says that whoever enters the town never leaves alive.""

""And yet, here we are, sipping coffee,"" I said, taking a sip. ""And tea,"" I added, nodding at Amelia.

""Where’s Elsa, by the way?"" Morgan asked.

""I’ve called her several times, but she hasn’t picked up,"" Amelia replied.

""Why don’t we go check on her?"" Morgan suggested.

We paid for our drinks and headed to Elsa’s apartment.

Upon arrival, we knocked on her door, but no one answered. We called her phone again. No response.

But we could hear her phone ringing from inside the apartment.

""Wait, I still have her spare key from when I stayed over after losing mine for a few days,"" Amelia said, pulling a key out of her purse and unlocking the door.

""Elsa? You here? We heard your phone ringing,"" Morgan called out as we entered.

We searched every room, but there was no sign of her. Then, we heard Amelia screaming from the bedroom. Morgan and I rushed over.

What we saw was beyond explanation.

Elsa’s body lay lifeless on her bed.

Without her head.

We gathered the courage to get closer and saw something strange. The tip of her neck was clean and smooth as if it had been like that for so long that new skin had formed.

There are people who work a low-paying job and just don’t make enough to live a comfortable life. They already budget and work as much as they can and still can’t cover living expenses. Those people obviously don’t profit from making coffee at home as they’re not buying coffee daily in the first place.

 The other type of poor is people who are just bad with money. They make decent money and would be able to cover their bills without issue but they don’t budget and they have no control over their spending. They get takeout every day instead of cooking, they buy shit that they don’t need, they’re in consumer debt cause they are influenced by social media to live a fancy life that they can’t afford. 

The advice of making your coffee at home or to make a monthly budget or to idk thrift clothes is clearly not for the first group of people. Obviously they’re not poor cause they buy orange juice. They’re poor because of structural/societal issues. 

The second group however isn’t actually poor, they’re just bad with money. They could be getting their dream car or maybe put down some money for a house but they’re spending hundreds of dollars per month on shit they don’t need. That’s who the advice is for.

In the past, I used to keep upskilling myself, thinking that once I've a job, I'll finally be able to do things I'm interested in outside of work hours.
Most of my family and friends are like that—they do a job they don't love, so they've money to do things they do love.

But what I've found is that I'm in a constant state of worry because I tend to fall asleep on the job. My performance at work is negatively impacted, so I'm always stressed about getting caught.

Even with a lot of coffee, good night's rest, exercise, good diet, etc., it's something I've been actively fighting against for years now. So this isn't a matter of willpower anymore. So far, the only thing that keeps me awake are creative-heavy tasks.

Right now, I don't know what to do. 

If I continue my current path, I'm afraid I'll be caught one day and fired from my job. Some previous supervisors were understanding about it, but I feel awful for letting them down.

If I spend my free time (outside of work hours) trying to learn more about my current job that I don't enjoy or if I've to take work home, I just feel miserable because I'm already spending 5 to 6 days a week on a job I don't like. So adding another day or extra hours is too much time spent on things that make me miserable.

If I spend my free time with hobbies, I feel guilty about work because I should be better at it, and I feel guilty for not spending enough time with my family and friends.

If I try to balance my hobbies with trying to upskill for work, I just don't have enough time for both and will be completely unproductive. (I need to do something at least weekly to be able to remember the information or become skilled at it, whether that's learning something for my job or my hobbies.)

If I sacrifice my spending time with others for the upskill and/or hobbies, I feel lonely. Even though I socialise with co-workers, I don't connect with them.

If I sacrifice time allocated to chores instead, I just feel gross because nothing is clean/ready.

I'd like to transition into a creative-heavy role, so that I can both do the job and not sleep on it, but it's going to take awhile for me to become skilled enough to transition into such role, as it's a career change for me. My current skills aren't up to scratch to be able to secure a creative-heavy role yet.

I'm very tempted to just quit my job and solely focus on my creative skills, but it's not right for me to burden my family and friends to take care of me like that.

I've considered working part-time, but the area I live in only wants full-timers, so part-time work would require at least 1.5 hours travel to the nearest town for work. Renting while working part-time also isn't feasible as the salary won't cover the cost of renting.

TLDR: How do I balance everything? I'd like to transition into a creative-heavy role, but it's going to take time for me to become skilled enough to transition into such role. I'm already spread too thin trying to juggle multiple things. Not sure if quitting or working part-time is advisable either.

But I can't for the life of me understand how at my 40s i start having this all of a sudden without something seriously wrong . I am careful of my diet. 

Just stress? Possibly, new job and all. 

I'm going to push for a colonoscopy of course, ASAP, but truth be told I'm scared of the results. This can't only be ""functional""...

I had normal bangs and then curtain bangs and then I didn’t have any bangs and every time I changed the crazy girl would change her bangs to match mine.

Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my weight loss journey so far—both to hold myself accountable and maybe inspire someone in a similar situation.

The Wake-Up Call

Three weeks ago, I had a doctor’s appointment, and my blood work showed high blood sugar levels. At 42 years old, 182 cm (6’0”) tall, and 136 kg (300 lbs), I knew I had to make a serious change. I’ve been overweight pretty much my whole life, but this time, something clicked—I couldn’t keep going down this road.

What I’m Doing

✅ Intermittent Fasting (IF) – Sticking to a 16:8 fasting window. Surprisingly, my hunger has gone way down.
✅ Low-Carb Diet – Cutting out most carbs, especially refined sugars and processed junk.
✅ No Coffee – Never been a coffee drinker, so no change there.
✅ More Movement – Haven’t started the gym yet, but I’ve been walking more and just being more active in general.

Progress – 3 Weeks In

📍 Starting Weight: 136 kg (300 lbs)
📍 Current Weight: 123 kg (271 lbs)
📍 Total Lost: 13 kg (29 lbs)



How I Feel

✔️ Energy levels are up – The first few days were rough, but I feel way better now.
✔️ Hunger & cravings are down – Cutting carbs was tough at first, but I feel less controlled by food now.
✔️ Clothes are fitting looser, and I can actually see changes in the mirror.

Next Steps
	•	Start weight training at the gym soon.
	•	Dial in my diet to make sure I’m getting enough protein.
	•	Stay consistent – This is the first time in years I feel like I’m actually making progress, and I don’t want to stop.

Feeling really motivated right now. If anyone else has done IF + low-carb, I’d love to hear your tips! Let’s do this.",7,1739694363.0,loseit,3,1.0,False

I'm doing a carnivorish / animal-based diet and am deciding to try IF.

This is only day 2, but I'm basically doing 2 meals a day, with an 18 our fast between.

I work night shift, so excuse the timeline haha:

Wake up at 4pm, have 3 eggs and coffee by 5pm...  
Lunch (Steak, Burger Patties, maybe an Avocado or 1 Mango) at 10:30pm with 1 more coffee...

Does this sound ok? I'm a 35/M who is 6'1 and 180lbs.

I'm trying to drop about 10lbs to lose my belly. I'm pretty active, but always hungry. I generally eat healthy, diet or not, but figured a 2 meal day with an IF would help shed pounds.

Thanks!

This rice porridge filled with pork, eggs and veggies is considered the soul food of the Hmong tribe. It’s got a bitter taste but is believed to have healing properties to the locals. Not the greatest tasting thing I’ve tried in Vietnam, but certainly worth a try. 

With our stomachs full, it was now time to head off to Pho Bang town, a tranquil and charming town hidden amongst forests. This was definitely an off-the-beaten-path destination compared to other stops in Ha Giang. The road here was stunning and dreamy with different colored flowers in bloom. The town moves at a slow pace and the centuries old houses will had me  transported to another time.

After our little visit, we made our way to Tham Ma Pass, my EZ driver's favorite road in all of the loop. When we got there, I understood why. It’s a beautiful and serene windy road surrounded by lush vegetation all around. Once we reached the top of the pass, there’s a nice rest stop with a coffee shop. There’s also a small stall run by a Hmong lady selling candy, grilled meats and desserts. Hmong children dressed in their traditional garbs were running around playing soccer and braiding hair. I grabbed some sweet mayflower roasted coffee and sat and admired the view of motorcycles driving along the pass. 

After Tham Ma we headed off to Sung La Valley where we passed through small villages and vibrant flower fields. The mayflower hadn’t bloomed yet so I can only imagine how much more beautiful it is in season. Riding the Chinh Khoanh pass there and back was quite the exhilarating drive as I counted 8 or 9 hairpin turns.

After the detour to Sung La Valley, we made our way to the Hmong King’s palace. This was the former home of the area’s Hmong Kings, a rich family that brought peace and prosperity to the region. They were able to do this by working with the colonial French government and then the Viet Minh led by Ho Chi Minh all while running an opium running business. Crazy stuff. Walking around the palace grounds, I could tell the property was well built in its time. Most of the original architecture and furniture was still intact. I enjoyed the architecture which was a blend of Chinese and European styles.

After the small history detour, the group made its way to the Lung Cu Flag Tower, the most northern part of the Ha Giang Loop. At the top of the flag tower, there were panoramic views of ethnic villages and you can even see the Chinese border as well. 

The roads leading to and leaving the Lung Cu Flag Tower was drenched in a red clay like mud. The roads were slippery here and you definitely have to be careful riding. I saw a couple travelers on a motorbike wipe out here. Thankfully they were driving slowly so it didn’t seem too bad.

Our final destination of the day was Dong Van town, a common stop when driving the loop. I can tell the town has been affected by the rise in tourism in recent years. Big hotels sprung up with tons of travelers out and about. The town center preserves its cultural heritage with well maintained wooden buildings from centuries past. The center was beautifully lit by lights and many businesses like restaurants, gift shops and massage shops were opened.

The group had dinner at one of the restaurants on the main strip. The meal of the night was black chicken hotpot, a soul warming family style meal. This is a Hmong specialty and is absolutely delicious. The plump chicken is served alongside fresh vegetables, mushrooms and noodles ready to be cooked in a steaming pot of soup at the center of the table. It’s a fun meal to share with family or friends. We also enjoyed the meal with “healthy” amounts of happy water, or rice wine.

After the meal, we walked around the strip where there’s a few lively bars that double as homestays. Big groups of travelers fill these bars. Our group ended up at Linh pub where there was karaoke night. So we heard everything from Vietnamese songs to Backstreet Boys and more. It’s a fun way to end the night off with the group. The tipsy journey home was easy as our homestay was literally a few minutes walk away.

She is obsessed with me, my voice, my words, the energy I give her. She texts me all day long, unable to find peace until she knows I’ve responded.

My SP sends me pictures of her drinks, like coffee, with the message: “This would taste so much better if you were here.” Then a voice message, her voice soft but filled with longing: “I’ve been thinking about you all day, it’s almost crazy.” She is completely crazy about me and always wants to be close to me.
