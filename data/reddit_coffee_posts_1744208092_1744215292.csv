1. I know I have to wait two hours after and 30 min before eating to take it. Can you drink something like coffee within two hours of taking it, or will that affect absorption? 

2. Do you find the effects only work with intense consistency, ie exact same time every day? Or are people feeling the benefits even if they‚Äôre not super consistent? I‚Äôm wondering what happens if I choose to sleep in or something. I haven‚Äôt even titrated up to be taking it that many times a day yet, but I have trouble sticking to strict schedules.

Hey everyone,
I‚Äôm 22 F and honestly, I never thought I‚Äôd be one of those people who get stuck on someone after a breakup. But here I am, months later, still thinking about someone who walked away like I was just a phase.

We dated for a year and a half‚Äîmy first serious relationship. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it was the kind of imperfect I thought we could grow through. We made Spotify playlists together, had ‚Äúour‚Äù grocery store, knew each other‚Äôs coffee orders, and had sleepovers where we‚Äôd talk about where we‚Äôd be in 5 years. Spoiler: we‚Äôre not in those plans anymore.

The breakup wasn‚Äôt even explosive. It was quiet. A slow pulling away until one day he said, ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt feel the same anymore.‚Äù And I nodded like I understood, like I was okay. But I wasn‚Äôt.
So I guess I‚Äôm just wondering‚Ä¶ how do you actually heal? Not in the ‚Äúgo touch grass‚Äù way but like‚Äîdeeply? How do you stop replaying things that can‚Äôt be undone? What helped you when you were in this place?

1jv97rs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1jv97rs/my_attention_span_got_really_bad_after_i_quit/,My attention span got really bad after I quit coffee. Is there anything I can do that doesn't involve medication?,"Backstory time. I'm a medical student. I've been abusing coffee for years just to get work done. At one point I was chugging six cups of coffee throughout the day just to stay focused.

A year ago, I ended up developing Raynaud's disease. As a result from all the exam stress and coffee, I guess it just developed. Literally out of thin air. I still kept drinking coffee, despite the pain in my fingertips and lack of blood circulation.

I decided to quit drinking entirely. I'm two weeks clean, going on my third. I feel like a teenager again. Sluggish, sleepy all the time and the hours just fly by. Yesterday, I tried cracking open a textbook. I've got a test tomorrow. Out of 50 pages I read around 9. I think it took somewhere around three hours.

I would have gladly gone to a psychiatrist to test myself for ADHD. But, in Bulgaria, adult ADHD isn't a recognized diagnosis. Only children below 18 can get a prescription for Concerta.

Frankly, I don't really give a shit about the test. It doesn't matter. It wasn't great before, but it was better. The only reason why I haven't gone back to caffeine is because my arm actually feels better.

Ironically, I hated working out when I was on coffee. I dreaded every moment. I decided to start working out again. I feel good doing it now and it's over really quickly. I just do it, like a reflex. Which is great but it hasn't really improved my concentration.

1jv97e8,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1jv97e8/yeah_dating_apps_suck/,"Yeah, dating apps suck.","I recently decided to try to find a girlfriend after being broken up with two months ago. One of my closest friends recently got into a very loving relationship off of a dating app and I was excited to give it a go, the area I'm in doesn't have many people so there were no good options, and I wanted to meet some brand new people. I downloaded Hinge in particular.

The few matches I did have were emotionally unavailable, dry texting, or just full of red flags. The profiles themselves were incredibly uninteresting. You get three prompts to talk about yourself and tell strangers about you, the amount of profiles I saw waste one of their prompts on either Dr Pepper or pineapple on pizza was astounding. I don't care what foods you like or dislike, I want to know what your hobbies were.

I had one great match, there was a woman who was super good looking and had a good profile showing her hobbies and her life off. we matched and she was super engaged in the conversation, telling me about herself, asking about me, laughing and joking, responding quickly, I thought I had struck gold and was about to ask her to get coffee- then she unmatched me. I don't understand this app man.

And the paywalling is INSANE! This specific app was said to have the best free versions, others like Bumble and Hinge literally won't let you see who has liked you unless you pay. Something that really pissed me off was they took your most compatible matches and put them behind a paywall, you are forced to send them ""roses"" instead of likes. You get one rose per WEEK as a free version user, which has no guarantee to even do anything. 3 roses costs you ten dollars, 5 costs you like $30 and if you go much further than that you very quickly get into the hundreds. It's SO fucking expensive and is clearly just meant for a profit, they actively prevent you from getting matches unless you pay them a shit ton of money.

(TLDR and summary)

After all of that, plus seeing a video on how it really fucks up the dating pool, making women slowly feel overwhelmed and men feel self conscious and lonely, which is a self-fueling problem as it causes men to swipe more and women to back away more, I deleted it. I wasn't getting any matches anyways and probably wouldn't unless I payed them a shit ton. Some people get really lucky and find their partners on hinge or tinder, but I probably will not have that luck and don't want to ruin my mental energy on this dystopian ass app. I'm gonna go to a coffee shop or bar or something and meet someone there instead.",1,1744214082.0,venting,0,1.0,False

In late October I (27F) found out I had critically low potassium (2.6 mmol/L). Went to the ER and long story short I‚Äôve been on potassium chloride supplements ever since. After much trial and error, we landed on 80 mEq of potassium chloride and finally got me back up to normal levels of potassium in my blood (3.4 mmol/L as of  January 22nd). A few weeks later I got back RENASIGHT results and found out I have Bartter Syndrome Type 3‚Ä¶.

And then I started to feel symptoms of low potassium return (nausea, headaches, fatigue, intense back pain/cramping, little muscle cramps in my legs and arms). I asked my PCP to test and sure enough it was back down at 3.1 mmol/L on March 14th. They increased my potassium chloride dosage to 100 mEq (50 mEq in the morning and 50 at night. Tested again on March 31st and it‚Äôs only at 3.2 mmol/L. 

Now my PCP is having me take 120 mEq/day (40 mEq, 3 times a day) and said it‚Äôs possible we may need to make it 140 mEq. Yesterday was my first day on 120 and it felt easier on my stomach than taking 50 mEq at a time but TODAY üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´ I feel like I am perpetually queasy now :/ it‚Äôs like a combo of nausea and hollowness that almost feels like depression or anxiety?? I know that‚Äôs a wild description but I feel so off.

UPDATE: Found some strategies to manage the nausea. After a week on 120 mEq, my potassium is at 3.1 mmol/L

I have a nephrology appointment on April 16th and then another with a doctor that specializes in genetic kidney conditions in late July. After I was scheduled for the second appointment it occurred to me that the one on the 16th might not make anything clearer or easier. 

ANYWAY, I will list my prescriptions etc below, but MY QUESTIONS ARE: 

- With Bartter Syndrome type 3, am I going to experience periodic crashes in potassium? How quickly can this happen and what can trigger it? 

- Is something like spironolactone next? And if so, is that something I can anticipate from the April 16th appointment?  

- Will I deplete potassium faster if I engage in rigorous exercise? 

- Are there any things I should be avoiding that might be aggravating this?  


Diagnoses: 

Bartter Syndrome 
Oral Allergy Syndrome 
ADHD 
Depression 
Anxiety


Prescriptions: 

1 Zyrtec nightly, 
1 elderberry capsule nightly,
125 mg of lamotrigine nightly 

20 mg Adderall daily,
20 mg citalopram daily (30 mg in the days leading up to my period) 

and then of course 40 mEq potassium chloride, three times per day 

EDIT [I forgot my topical prescriptions!]: 

Tretinoin Cream 0.1% nightly, Clindamycin/Benzoyl Peroxide Gel every morning, Clindamycin Phosphorus lotion every morning 1% 


Other habits: 

I frequently have two little scoops of collagen powder in my smoothie. Never more than that in a single day. 

I smoke weed daily. 

I do not drink coffee. I will have tea on occasion (maybe twice a month max) and I probably have a caffeinated soda once a week. 

I‚Äôm eating at least 80 g of protein each day and im not tracking potassium but I‚Äôm trying my best (bananas, prunes, salmon, kale, brocolli, kefir, sweet potatoes, etc). 

As of right now, im not doing any rigorous exercise. When I first found out about the low potassium and started seeing a nutritionist she said that exercising with such low levels would do damage to my heart (I had stopped going to exercise classes bc of the symptoms I was having from low potassium. I didn‚Äôt know the cause, but it didn‚Äôt feel safe and she said that was the absolute right choice). Now I just feel scared to exercise at a high level.

From towering inflatable product replicas to eye-catching arches and mascots, these large, colorful displays help businesses draw attention at events, retail locations, and promotional campaigns. Many of the world‚Äôs top-quality advertising inflatables come from manufacturers in China, where advanced production techniques, skilled craftsmanship, and cost-effective solutions converge to serve clients across the globe. Choosing an advertising inflatables manufacturer in China means gaining access to custom, affordable, and durable products that can bring any marketing idea to life.

One of the key advantages of working with Chinese inflatable manufacturers is their ability to deliver high-quality, customized products at competitive prices. China has long been known for its robust manufacturing infrastructure, and when it comes to inflatables, the country is home to numerous factories with years of experience in creating everything from giant advertising balloons to inflatable tents and cartoon characters. These manufacturers use cutting-edge materials like reinforced PVC and Oxford fabric, combined with precision printing and stitching methods, to ensure durability and visual appeal. Whether a client needs a simple branded balloon or a complex inflatable replica of a product, Chinese manufacturers can deliver at scale without sacrificing quality. **For more:** [**advertising inflatables manufacturer China**](https://www.inflatablestogo.com/about-us/)

Customization is a cornerstone of China‚Äôs inflatable manufacturing industry. Leading manufacturers offer a wide range of options in terms of shape, size, color, and design. Clients can send in logos, artwork, and design specs, and in return, receive a fully tailored inflatable that perfectly represents their brand. Need a 20-foot-tall inflatable coffee cup with realistic graphics? Or a custom-designed entrance arch for your next big event? Chinese manufacturers are equipped to bring even the most creative visions to life. Their design teams work closely with clients, often providing 3D mock-ups and sample visuals before production begins, ensuring every detail meets expectations.

Another reason businesses around the world choose Chinese manufacturers is the cost efficiency they offer. Advertising budgets can be tight, especially for small businesses or startups. Chinese manufacturers provide a way to create large-scale, high-impact visuals without the high price tag typically associated with custom advertising materials. The favorable pricing doesn‚Äôt mean compromising on quality‚Äîthanks to efficient production processes and access to raw materials, manufacturers in China are able to offer cost-effective products that still meet international standards. Additionally, many factories offer fast turnaround times, making it possible to meet tight event deadlines.

Shipping and global reach are also strong suits of Chinese inflatable manufacturers. Most reputable companies have experience exporting products worldwide and offer international shipping services, along with helpful guidance on customs and import regulations. Whether you're based in North America, Europe, Australia, or the Middle East, getting inflatables delivered from China has become easier and more streamlined than ever. Many manufacturers even provide multilingual customer service, making communication and coordination seamless for clients from different countries and cultures. This global approach has helped position China as a leading supplier of advertising inflatables on the international stage.

In conclusion, partnering with an advertising inflatables manufacturer in China is a smart move for any business looking to make a lasting visual impression without overspending. With their expertise in custom design, high-quality materials, affordable pricing, and international shipping capabilities, Chinese manufacturers continue to lead the way in the inflatable advertising industry. Whether you're launching a new product, organizing a festival, promoting a retail store, or branding your business at a trade show, advertising inflatables made in China can elevate your campaign and deliver the attention your brand deserves.",1,1744213876.0,SmartAdvertise,0,1.0,False

1jv93su,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jv93su/man_made_art_12/,Man Made Art (1/2),"Detective Gary Garcia examined the body suspended over the bed. It was cut into layers,¬† like a matryoshka doll that opened longways instead of in the middle. The only thing untouched by the killer‚Äôs knife was the respiratory system, which was partly encased in a plastic shell.

Detective Garcia‚Äôs partner, Luke Lee, observed the body with professional detachment.

‚ÄúIt looks‚Ä¶‚Äù began Lee.

*Like art*, finished detective Garcia in his head. The sliced layers were suspended perfectly by wire so they lay over each other to create a seamless impression of the body pre-cut. The victim had been beautiful in life, and the killer had allowed her to remain so in death. The topmost layer, which held her face, looked serene, and the particular care and preservation in the chest area made it look as if she could still be breathing, softly, *Like a lover in repose.*

And then there was the rest.

The layers of exposed viscera. It evoked something in Garcia, that‚Äôs how he knew it was art. *The contrast*. The beautiful with the ugly. The face and the person, with the clockwork and biological machinery, exposed for all to see.

‚ÄúIt looks‚Ä¶ ,‚Äù said Lee, finishing his thought, ‚Äú ‚Ä¶like there‚Äôs webbing between the layers.‚Äù

Garcia looked over the corpse again.

‚ÄúYou mean the wires holding the layers¬† up?‚Äù asked Garcia, pointing at a translucent wire that held up the back of the victim‚Äôs foot, going up through several bones, and exiting out of one of the middle toes.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Lee, pointing at the empty space between the layers.

Garcia tilted his head, and caught something in the light.

‚ÄúI see it,‚Äù said Garcia.

Between each layer was a fine webbing, finer than spider‚Äôs silk.

‚ÄúGood eye,‚Äù said Garcia. Even after a decade of working together, he was still amazed by Lee‚Äôs powers of perception. ‚ÄúI know it exists and I can still barely see it, how did you spot it in the first place? More importantly, what do you think it is?‚Äù

The thin detective Luke Lee scratched his scruff.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶ no that‚Äôs dumb‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOut with it,‚Äù said the burlier Garcia. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs¬† your gut telling you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what it is, but‚Ä¶ if I didn‚Äôt know any better, I‚Äôd say they were veins.‚Äù

Garcia tilted his head, and tried to catch more of the fine network of silk-like fibers. There was, he admitted, a sort of method to the seemingly random nature of them. They seemed concentrated most around the inner organs, and between the layers of skin. Now that he saw that they essentially connected everything together, he wondered how he missed them at all. Indeed, they seemed to be connecting the disparate parts of the victim.

‚ÄúFuck me,‚Äù said Garcia. ‚ÄúThey do look like veins.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt be though,‚Äù said Lee.

‚ÄúOr could they? Let‚Äôs see what the lab boys have to say.‚Äù

Garcia called for a member of the forensics team and asked for a set of glass slides. He pinched a section of the fibers between them, handing them back to the forensics member, asking him and his team to find out what the fibers were. The forensics member took the sample, and rejoined his team.

‚ÄúWhat do we think for time of death?‚Äù asked Lee, preparing an onsite autopsy form.

Garcia looked at his partner, and then at the body. *Time of death?* It was surprisingly difficult to say. The victim‚Äôs family had said that she had stopped responding to texts and messages approximately three days ago, after a night out with friends. The victim went radio silent for the rest of the weekend. They hadn‚Äôt thought it was too unusual until a relative that worked in the same office as the victim noticed that she had failed to show up for work on monday without so much as a sick call. That‚Äôs when alarm bells started going off. The family asked for a wellness check that morning, and what the police officer found in the victim‚Äôs apartment was what led to Lee and Garcia being called in. That left a window of nearly seventy-two full hours. Enough time for advanced signs of decomposition to begin to set in, especially as it was the middle of summer. However, as it was, the body had not even begun to smell. Which didn‚Äôt make sense. The butchery‚Äì though Garcia struggled to think of it as that ‚Äìof the body would have taken hours alone. Plenty of time for decomposition to set in.

‚ÄúPut it down as indeterminable,‚Äù said Garcia.

‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù hummed Lee.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt agree?‚Äù asked Garcia, turning to his partner, seeing his eyes narrowed in concentration.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that I *disagree*,‚Äù said his partner. ‚ÄúI just have a thought is all. It‚Äôs the middle of summer.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no detectable odor.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight again.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd in this heat there would have been in a matter of hours. And look here.‚Äù

Lee pointed at the seams of the victim‚Äôs skin, where the two largest halves of the matryoshka-like cuts would have met. There was scabbing. *Signs of healing*.

Garcia was struck dumb.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way,‚Äù said Garcia. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs really no way. That would mean‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúShe could have been alive this morning‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIn this state? Impossible. Unless you‚Äôre saying the killer somehow sliced her up and strung her up like this in minutes, a half hour tops before the officer who came to check on her stopped by‚Ä¶ no there‚Äôs no way.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying, it looks like she was alive until *very* recently.‚Äù

Garcia just shook his head.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something else,‚Äù said Lee. ‚ÄúSquint your eyes, and look at the body. Tell me what you see. Or rather, tell me what you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

Garcia arched an eyebrow at his partner, then did as he asked. He squinted his eyes and then looked at the body. He didn‚Äôt see anything. But of course, he realized, that‚Äôs exactly what Lee was getting at.

You see there was a classic trick that detectives and members of forensics pulled when examining a body. Squinting at it to better distinct the different hues of it, to see where the blood had pooled. Even in deaths caused by heavy blood loss the remaining blood would noticeably pool within the body. As it happened, there was no pooled blood in the victim‚Äôs body, and the corpse lacked that distinct paleness that came with a body purposefully drained, as they sometimes were, like pigs.

‚ÄúShit,‚Äù said Garcia. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fresh. *Really* fresh.‚Äù

Lee nodded.

‚ÄúNot enough time for the blood to pool even,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to jot down for time of death then?‚Äù

‚ÄúPut it down for early this morning,‚Äù said Garcia, not able to believe what he was saying, or seeing.

Lee nodded again, writing their conclusion on the form. He then tapped his pen on the next line of the form.

‚ÄúApparent cause of death?‚Äù he asked Garcia.

‚ÄúIndeterminable,‚Äù said Garcia‚Äì which was comical looking at the state of the victim, but if she had been alive this morning, then, miraculously, it hadn‚Äôt been the cutting that killed her.

This time Lee didn‚Äôt disagree. Until a proper autopsy was performed, there would be no official cause of death.

With the onsite autopsy done, Garcia took in the body again. He had trouble tearing his eyes away from it. The body‚Äì the woman ‚Äìwas both grotesque and horrendously beautiful. The way the top layer of her rested seamlessly on top of the rest, so that her pale, almost luminescent breasts, shone beneath the gray overcast light of day. The killer had strung her up over her bed and left the window open. It was a wonder that no one from the apartment complex across the street had seen her‚Äì it was a tall building ‚ÄìGarcia imagined at a certain floor someone would have had the perfect view of her.

Garcia‚Äôs pulse quickened, suddenly he noticed his partner staring at him, and realized that he had been entranced with the body for too long. He tried to think of an excuse as to why, but couldn‚Äôt think of anything. It was in the middle of this panicked thinking, that someone came up to talk to the detectives.

‚ÄúExcuse me, detectives,‚Äù said the same member of forensics that was helping them earlier. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just about packing up now, wanted to let you know in case you needed anything else from us before we go.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need anything else at this time,‚Äù said Garcia. ‚ÄúDid you find anything interesting? Something to point us in the right direction?‚Äù

The forensics member nodded his head.

‚ÄúYes, we were able to reasonably conclude that there was no sign of forced entry.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo it was someone she knew?‚Äù said Lee, turning to Garcia.

‚ÄúProbably. Almost always is,‚Äù commented Garcia.

Garcia and Lee left soon after, with Garcia taking the body in one final time before he closed the door. It left him with an ugly feeling. He felt a wave of nauseating revulsion toward himself.

Garcia was still thinking about the body hours later, when he and Lee were at their desks, making phone calls, arranging interviews, waiting for the body boys to give them a cause of death. At some point, in between calls, a member of forensics dropped off a manilla envelope with pictures of the scene in it. Garcia opened the envelope out of instinct, rote and mechanical. If he had been thinking, or been aware of what he was doing, he might not have decided to open it, because he would have been afraid of exactly what happened. And what happened is that he became transfixed.

Garcia hadn‚Äôt stopped thinking about the body. It lingered on in the back of his mind, even as he spoke to the victims family and friends to arrange interviews, all he could think about was how beautiful she had appeared hanging over her bed. *Like a lover in repose*. So when he laid eyes on the scene of the crime once again he became re-enamoured with the body. He could almost imagine the victim‚Äôs chest rising and falling, serenely luminescent, like moonlit marble. It was almost enough to send his heart aflutter.

*You‚Äôre sick*, he thought*, real fucken sick*.

‚ÄúWhat do you see?‚Äù asked Lee from behind Grcia‚Äôs shoulder, causing him to jump inside his skin.

Garcia hoped he didn‚Äôt look like he needed new pants. He also smelled coffee, and sure enough when he turned his seat, he saw that Lee had a piping hot cup of probably old coffee from the precinct pot.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing,‚Äù said Garcia, not wanting to say what he was thinking out loud.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not nothing,‚Äù said his partner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something, a big something. I‚Äôm sure of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt really isn‚Äôt.‚Äù

His partner sighed, and leaned on his desk.

‚ÄúGary,‚Äù he said, full stop. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been partners for how long? I can‚Äôt even remember‚Äì‚Äù *Ten years, but who‚Äôs counting?*. ‚Äú ‚ÄìYou have a way of getting into those sickos‚Äôs heads.‚Äù

*Because I am one of those Sickos,* he thought.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your point?‚Äù asked Garcia.

‚ÄúMy point is you got that anxious look on your face. The one that shows up when you really get in a killer‚Äôs head.‚Äù

Garcia took another look at the photo in his hands. The wires holding her up didn‚Äôt show on the photo, so it looked like she was floating.

‚ÄúIt almost looks like she‚Äôs breathing‚Ä¶ like‚Ä¶ a woman you just slept with, y‚Äôknow, someone beside you. The way the body was arranged‚Ä¶ I think that was intentional, like the killer, in their own fucked up way, had been in love with her.‚Äù

Lee considered the photo and then shot a sideways glance at Garcia. For a quick, and yet still too long second, Garcia agonized over what Lee would say. A second longer, and Garcia broke the silence himself.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs art,‚Äù he said, quick;y adding ‚Äúin a fucked up kind of way, I think that‚Äôs what the killer was going for.‚Äù

Lee nodded, seeming to consider Garcia‚Äôs statement. Then, after taking a sip of his coffee, started them on a new track of thought.

‚ÄúCircling back to possible suspects. Forensics says there was no sign of forced entry, meaning it was probably someone she knew. Rolling with your interpretation of the state of the victim, wouldn‚Äôt it be likely that it was a boyfriend or lover?‚Äù

Garcia touched his nose to his steepled hands.

‚ÄúInterviews are already set up. We‚Äôll ask about a boyfriend then,‚Äù said Garcia. ‚ÄúAny news from the body boys about the fibers? Or anything at all?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope. They weren‚Äôt able to identify the fibers. They‚Äôre sending them to a specialist. They think they might have a cause of death already, but they didn‚Äôt want to say what they think it might be, they want to rule out a few things first.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid they say why?‚Äù

‚ÄúSome of their ideas were ‚Äòoutlandish‚Äô,‚Äù said Lee. ‚ÄúTheir words, not mine.‚Äù

Garcia let out a noise that was somewhere between a snort, a chuckle, and a grunt. *It‚Äôs an outlandish case!*

A few days and several interviews later they had come up short. Not only had the victim not had a boyfriend at the time of death, she had reportedly, according to her family and close co-workers, identified as both asexual, and aromantic, never having had a romantic partner in her entire life. That wasn‚Äôt a death knell per se, but it killed the one thing that Garcia and Lee had resembling a lead in the case, especially as interviewing the victim‚Äôs inner, and even outer, circle had yielded no other possible suspects. The friends she‚Äôd been out with on the weekend that she disappeared had perfect alibis, corroborated by their phone activity.

The case stalled for a matter of weeks. In that time the body had been taken, and prepared for a closed casket. The fibers still hadn‚Äôt been identified, probably they hadn‚Äôt been looked at yet, specialists of any kind that help the police always had more on their plate than they could handle, so it could be some time before they heard anything back at all. But they had heard back from the body boys. Garcia had been glad to finally have the report, but when Lee read it for the both of them, he couldn‚Äôt believe what he was hearing.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre shitting me,‚Äù Garcia had said.

‚ÄúI wish I were, but that‚Äôs what the file says,‚Äù Lee had said, holding a large envelope with the body boy‚Äôs report.

The cause of death? Dehydration.

‚ÄúShock, blood loss, organ failure, anything that would have made *sense*,‚Äù said Garcia. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure you heard them right Lee?‚Äù

Lee only nodded.

Later, when Garcia was at his desk reflecting on the strange case, he was once again gazing into the photograph of the victim. She hung there in the picture, beautifully, ethereally. Was she the first? Were there others? Was she the last and only? That last thought shot a queasy dread up his spine, and he had to ask himself an uncomfortable question, or rather, the uncomfortable question arose but he did not ask it. He was scared of the answer.

Suddenly, a voice called to him from a distant elsewhere that Garcia was surprised to find that he inhabited as well.

‚ÄúAnother body was found,‚Äù said the voice of his partner.

A pulse of exhilaration went up Garcia‚Äôs spine, quickly followed by a wave of disgust, mostly at himself. They had a number of cases open, that‚Äôs just police work, but Garcia knew which case his partner was referring to.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù he replied, and so they did.

The scene of the second killing was a studio apartment that lived up to the name. There were storyboards hanging on the wall, art, and prints. The victim, a¬† young man, had been stripped naked, seated at his drawing desk, appearing as a posed model, or sculpted statue. Unlike the first victim, which had been fully sectioned, the young man only had his hand dissected. Its layers pulled and revealed like a rough sketch in an anatomy book.

The young man had been wiry and skinny, but the killer had posed him in such a way as to make him appear elegant, lean instead of thin, thoughtful instead of lost. Like the first victim there was a certain beauty to the young man, an elegance that was only rivalled by drawings which piled dotted the sheets of paper on his desk, and on the floor. Piles and piles of drawings. They were naturalistic drawings, of people, animals, and plants, they seemed realer than real, capturing the very essence of the subject. Each drawing was small, as if the artist had had a limited range of motion, and indeed, looking at the dissected hand, if the killer had preserved the artist‚Äôs ability to draw, then it would have not been able to move very much, especially considering the ad hoc pine architecture that had been placed to hold the hand and its layers up.

Still taking in the sight, Garcia wondered if ‚Äúyoung‚Äù was the right word for the man. The spartan like decoration‚Äì that is to say, lack thereof ‚Äìin the apartment, and the build of the man, had given Garcia the impression of youth, but looking closer at the body he wasn‚Äôt sure. The man had deep wrinkles in some places, like his skin had shrivelled up, and deep crows feet around his eyes as well.

Lee, who had also been examining the body, made a clicking sound with his tongue, and turned away from it.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù asked Garcia.

‚ÄúThe victim, he died of dehydration, I‚Äôm sure of it,‚Äù said Lee. He turned so he was facing Garcia again. ‚ÄúThe wrinkles around the victim‚Äôs eyes aren‚Äôt crows feet, nor I suspect, will we find that the victim was all that old. All those wrinkles are signs of his body thirsting for water. Right now it‚Äôs just speculation, but if it‚Äôs the same killer as the woman hung over he bed, I‚Äôd bet good money that the monster who did what they did to the sleeping woman, was also responsible for what happened to this man. And look.‚Äù Garcia fished out a slide from his pocket, seemingly capturing empty air between the layers of the dead man‚Äôs hands. Garcia watched this with some amount of curiosity, though he suspected he knew what his partner was about to show him.

Lee closed the slide with a small band, and handed it to Garcia, who saw right away what it was supposed to be. In¬† between the slide, were the same fibers that they had found in between each layer of the first victim.

The pair of detectives went through and did a full on site examination of the body. Afterwards they aided the forensics team in scouring the small apartment for evidence, and once again found that there appeared to be no evidence of forced entry.

If the victims knew the killer, then there would be a link between the two, so it looked like another round of interviews for Garcia and Lee with the first victims friends and family, as well as whoever they could speak to concerning the second victim. This is how they spent the next few days. Though as it would turn out, there was no connection between the first and second victim, and it would seem that the artist had not only lived spartan, but lonely as well. He had no friends to speak of, something that Lee remarked was not uncommon in modern young men. The closest thing they had resembling to a lead after their first round of interviews came from the second victim‚Äôs mother, who mentioned that he had been excited for a lunch meeting with a client, who according to the timing, might have been the last person to see the artist alive.

Lee and Garcia arranged to meet with the client, whose name they found through the artist's social media pages. He had been commissioned by a commercial lab named Plant Projects, and had met with one of their scientists over lunch to discuss the work they wanted for him.

‚ÄúSounds like something they could have done over email,‚Äù said Garcia.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how those business types are,‚Äù said Lee as they entered the lab‚Äôs building. ‚ÄúMeetings, meetings‚Ä¶ meetings.‚Äù

The inside of the building, the parts after the front desk and first hallway, were a hot humid environment that were lit mostly with UV lights.

Hunkering in the dank dungeon of UV light were people in lab coats snipping at, brushing, and measuring‚Äì in one way or another ‚Äìplants. The only person in a lab coat not attending to any plants, or to anything really, was the person they were there to interview. He was sitting at a table that appeared to have been cleared away for them to meet at. On his breast was a metal name badge that read: *Director of Mycology, Anthony Okawa*.

‚ÄúGood evening Mr. Okawa. I‚Äôm detective Gary Garcia, and this is my partner.‚Äù

‚ÄúLuke Lee,‚Äù said his partner.

‚ÄúGood evening,‚Äù said Okawa, with practiced courteousness.

‚ÄúAs I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve been told, we were made aware that you were the last person to see a certain artist alive, and were hoping to ask you any questions regarding how he appeared when you saw him.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my,‚Äù said Okawa, open mouthed, gawking at the detectives. Like his courteousness, there was a practiced, performative air to his exasperation.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, were you close?‚Äù asked Garcia, with a cocked eyebrow. He found Okawa‚Äôs open mouthed shock to be a bit much.

‚ÄúNo, not particularly, but I did just see him alive only last week. I‚Äôm not sure *how* I feel. I didn‚Äôt know him, but I saw him, talked to him, ate with him. And now you tell me he‚Äôs dead. It's just‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs shocking I suppose.‚Äù

Something about Okawa‚Äôs answer felt off to Garcia, though he couldn‚Äôt say why.

‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said Garcia, still wondering what was so unsettling about Okawa. ‚ÄúDo you mind if we start with the questions?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, go ahead, have a seat.‚Äù

Garcia and Lee took a seat opposite of Okawa on the empty workspace.

Garcia started them off.

‚ÄúJust for the sake of record, the victim was working for you, correct?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot for *me* exactly, but for the company I work with, I was just the one that hashed out the details with him regarding his work.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what was that work exactly?‚Äù

‚ÄúDrawings, for some of our new crossbreeds. Artistic renditions can be better for accentuating unique characteristics that may not be as prominent in photos.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you know the victim before he was commissioned for your company‚Äôs work?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes and no. I knew of him from an art profile I saw online. I was a fan of his work and so it was me who recommended him for the job. His ability to capture nature in his art was quite amazing. Perchance did you have an opportunity to see his work?‚Äù Here Okawa began to talk with his hands. That‚Äôs when Garcia understood what had unsettled him before. That moment, where Okawa began to talk with his hands, that wasn‚Äôt an act, but the moments leading up to it were, a very practiced one. Okawa was the kind of man that always wore a mask, even in the most mundane situations.

‚ÄúWe did,‚Äù said Garcia. ‚ÄúIt was indeed impressive work.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you think so. Yes, so, I was a fan, then I met him, and now he‚Äôs dead, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a bit much. I‚Äôm not sure how I should feel.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fair,‚Äù said Garcia. ‚ÄúAs far as your last meeting with him, was this another discussion about his commission over lunch?‚Äù

‚ÄúTechnically speaking yes, though most of the details had already been hashed out. I‚Äôm embarrassed to admit it was mostly so I could spend more time with him. As I said I was a huge fan.‚Äù

Garcia laughed with a grunt.

‚ÄúDid the victim seem off to you in your last meeting? Did he seem anxious or worried?‚Äù

Okawa seemed to search the detective‚Äôs faces.

‚ÄúNo detectives, he didn't appear overly anxious to me, or scared. He seemed perfectly normal.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see, thank you,‚Äù said Garcia, preparing to write something down. ‚ÄúAround when did your lunch with Thomas begin and end?‚Äù

Okawa put a hand to his chin.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt remember exactly,‚Äù said Garcia. ‚ÄúA rough time will do.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù hummed Okawa. ‚ÄúSometimes around noon, and I kept him probably longer than I should have, possibly until around one or just after.‚Äù

Garcia wrote the time down for the sake of good record keeping, and shot a glance at his partner.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any further questions. Lee?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust the one,‚Äù said Lee, stone faced.

‚ÄúBy all means detective,‚Äù said Okawa.

‚ÄúWhat is it you do here?‚Äù

Okawa seemed genuinely perplexed by the question.

‚ÄúAs I mentioned I‚Äôm really more of an assistant for the folks here who work on the plants. It‚Äôs not very exciting,‚Äù said Okawa.

‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm sure,‚Äù said Lee. ‚ÄúBut just humour us.‚Äù

Okawa cleared his throat, and looked at Garcia, as if to say *‚Äúcan you believe this man?‚Äù*. Garcia for one, enjoyed watching his partner work.

‚ÄúWhat? you want me to tell you about my morning routine?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you have to, to get to the exact details of your work.‚Äù

Okawa grinned, letting out a stifled chuckle.

‚ÄúThe work I do here isn‚Äôt something I can talk about with just anyone.‚Äù Okawa cleared his throat. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs all detectives I should get back to helping the other researchers.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you for your time,‚Äù said Lee, shaking the man‚Äôs hands.

Garcia and Lee said farewell to the scientist. Garcia began to leave, but noticed that Lee had not yet begun to move. The energy after the farewell grew somewhat awkward, and that‚Äôs when Okawa suddenly realized that he had to go to a different part of the building. Only when Okawa had left, did Lee turn to leave with his partner. Garcia was just about to ask why Lee had suddenly decided to ask Okawa about his work, when Lee stopped to ask a pair of scientists they passed the same question.

‚ÄúWhat are you guys doing there?‚Äù asked Lee as he and Garcia passed by a working pair of scientists.

The scientists were a male and female pair. They smiled at each before replying.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working on increasing the growth rates of a new superfood we‚Äôre developing. Can‚Äôt say much more than that.‚Äù

‚ÄúHm, very interesting,‚Äù said Lee, nodding. ‚ÄúSay do you know what Okawa works on specifically?‚Äù

The female scientist spoke up first.

‚ÄúHe helps us with some of the stop gaps in our research, namely addressing our plant‚Äôs abilities to take in nutrients from the ground. I thought it was going well, but he cleared out his experiments from the table top earlier, must be prepping a new batch.‚Äù

‚ÄúActually he just wanted to give his mycelium some darkness,‚Äù said the male. ‚ÄúI saw him moving stuff around and asked why. I didn‚Äôt know mycelium needed darkness, but hey, I‚Äôm not the fungus guy.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh,‚Äù said the female scientist.

‚ÄúI'm sorry,‚Äù said Lee, ‚Äúmycelium?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs how he‚Äôs helping our plants absorb nutrients out of the ground faster,‚Äù said the female scientist. ‚ÄúThey act sort of like veins that suck up nutrients from the dirt.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is very interesting,‚Äù said Lee, smiling.

‚ÄúWe could say more, but you should probably ask Okawa, he loves talking about his fungus.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said Lee, shooting a glance at Garcia who was half in half out of the lab.

Lee smiled and bid the pair farewell, joining Garcia who was hallway out to the hallway waiting for him. ‚ÄúOne last question, were you two here when Okawa went out to lunch with that artist?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe one we hired to do the sketches for our journal submission, yeah, Okawa was stoked. Apparently we hired him on his rec.‚Äù

‚ÄúAround what time would you say he got back?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, we lost him for the day, didn‚Äôt come back to the lab until the day after,‚Äù the scientist shook his head and smiled.

‚ÄúVery interesting,‚Äù said Lee, ‚ÄúThanks for the information, you two have a nice day.‚Äù

Lee turned away from the pair, and joined Garcia in the hallway outside the lab.

‚ÄúPartner?‚Äù asked Garcia.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat was that about? With the pair just now?‚Äù

‚ÄúFollowing a bit of intuition,‚Äù said Lee as they walked through the long hallway, gazing into the middle distance.

‚ÄúAlright what did you see?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure. Probably nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúSpill,‚Äù grunted Garcia, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm curious now, plain and simple.‚Äù

Lee let out a bit of air from his nostrils, and it was something like a huff and a laugh.

‚ÄúHis desk,‚Äù said Lee, adding nothing else.

‚ÄúWhat about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúHis desk was empty, unlike the other workstations in the lab. That‚Äôs assuming it was a workstation, and that it was his. I was planning on asking the pair, but they told me without me having to ask. He was also dodging the question about his work. Work he said was too sensitive to mention at all, and yet the pair just now didn‚Äôt seem to think much about spilling the beans on that. I can‚Äôt say why, I just got a weird vibe from the guy, thought he was lying for some reason, so I asked about the lunch he had with the artist, and again. Okawa said he was out with the artist for an hour, but the pair back there said they lost him for a day. Something‚Äôs off.‚Äù

Garcia stopped and looked at his partner.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not nothing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI got a weird feeling from him too.‚Äù

‚ÄúActing suspicious around the police isn‚Äôt anything new, nerves will do that to someone, but‚Ä¶ this Okawa guy seems more off than that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI agree,‚Äù said Garcia. ‚ÄúExtremely off.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe something, maybe nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe something, yeah,‚Äù echoed Garcia. ‚ÄúWhat do you want to do?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to tail the guy for a bit, just for some peace of mind.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, let's set up across the street.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Garcia, It‚Äôs just a feeling, nothing concrete, I‚Äôll do it alone. Besides, results for those fibers were supposed to be back today. I‚Äôd like for one of us to start working on whether those fibers are relevant to the case or not.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood call,‚Äù said Garcia. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be lost without you deducing the world for me, partner.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmph,‚Äù let out Lee. ‚ÄúAnd I couldn‚Äôt trust my deduction without your gut instinct. If I think it, sometimes you just know it, and it puts me at ease. Later partner.‚Äù

‚ÄúHeh,‚Äù let out Garcia. ‚ÄúLater.‚Äù

And they parted.

Once he was back at the precinct, Garcia went straight for the body boys‚Äôs office.

‚ÄúDetective Garcia,‚Äù said one of the body boys, greeting him.

‚ÄúEvening, Lee told me you would have something about the fibers for me today.‚Äù

The body boy he was speaking to looked at him apologetically.¬†

‚ÄúSorry to say, but we haven‚Äôt heard back from that specialist.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey said there‚Äôd be a delay, which is weird, the Plant Projects lab usually delivers so quickly.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you say Plant Projects?‚Äù asked Garcia, surprised.

‚ÄúYeah, why?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was just there.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, no way!‚Äù said the more excitable body boy. ‚ÄúWhy were you there?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was there to talk to a guy named Anthony Okawa, he was the last person to speak to the latest victim.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh weird!‚Äù said the other, not as excitable but still fairly energetic, body boy. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the guy we sent the sample to.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù said Garcia, not really asking for clarification, just announcing further surprise.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù said one of the body boys. ‚ÄúThe fibers you collected looked like they might be a part of a mycelium network, very far out stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd very unlikely,‚Äù interjected the other body boy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs why we had Okawa check on the sample for us. I‚Äôm surprised he didn‚Äôt mention it to you, he knew where the sample came from, he even knew it was your case.‚Äù

‚ÄúWould he have been able to give us anything? I thought you said there was a delay.‚Äù

‚ÄúA delay in the information report sure,‚Äù said the body boy.

‚ÄúBut that's like‚Ä¶ logistical,‚Äù said the other. ‚ÄúWe need it for records and stuff, but he said he found out pretty quickly what it was. Where it would have come from and whatnot.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell?‚Äù asked Garcia.

‚ÄúWell what?‚Äù asked the body boys in unison.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the origin of those fibers, the mycelium.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt say,‚Äù said one.

‚ÄúAnd we didn‚Äôt ask,‚Äù said the other. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôd be on the report.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù hummed Garcia, suddenly uneasy.

Garcia made a call to his partner, who didn‚Äôt answer, and the body boys watched, mystified at Garcia‚Äôs sudden change in demeanor when Lee didn‚Äôt pick up.",1,1744213829.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1jv90zv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1jv90zv/god_im_so_tired/,God I'm so tired!!!!!!,"So I was prescribed Atarax for problems sleeping due to mania. I am so EXHAUSTED that I have to take naps throughout the day to function. This is terrible, as I'm a mom and cannot function. I sleep amazingly at night now and feel well-rested when I wake up, but after three hours of being awake, I'm exhausted. It could also be that I'm cutting back on caffeine intake and only drinking one ice coffee and one Red Bull a day. Some days I don't even have the red bull. But is there a fix for this?

I am currently on 50mg of Atarax, 150mg of Lamcital, and 40mg of Strattera. Do not suggest benzos, SSRIs, or SSNRIs because they do not work, and they cause me to spiral. ",1,1744213641.0,BipolarReddit,2,1.0,False

‚òï[Tip Jar](https://buymeacoffee.com/oldbublysoul29) I enjoy doing these weekly posts & hope that others have found them to be resourceful. If you would like to toss a coin or two (thanks in advance!!), I‚Äôve set up a Buy Me a Coffee page.

1jv90n5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bengaluru/comments/1jv90n5/is_indiranagar_something_of_a_phenomenon_in_pop/,Is Indiranagar something of a phenomenon in pop culture?,"Ever since I‚Äôve been in Bengaluru for the good part of the last decade, Indiranagar in Bengaluru has definitely evolved into something of a pop culture phenomenon. It‚Äôs not just a neighborhood anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs a symbol of modern, urban, upscale Bengaluru, often used in jokes, memes, advertisements, and casual conversations to evoke a particular vibe.

What are the possible reasons, let‚Äôs dwell a bit 

1. ‚ÄúIndiranagar ka Gunda‚Äù ‚Äì the viral Boost ad

The most iconic pop culture moment was Rahul Dravid‚Äôs line in that television ad ‚ÄúIndiranagar ka gunda hoon main.‚Äù It went viral and turned into a meme across India. It reinforced the image of Indiranagar as a hip, affluent, and slightly cheeky place.

2. Upscale Urban Lifestyle
While a lot more of Bengaluru areas are having it now, Indiranagar is considered a hub for craft breweries, designer boutiques, fine dining, and trendy cafes. It‚Äôs the OG. In fact the famous walking tour company has a tour called Tipsy in Thippasandra and take you all over the aforementioned Indiranagar pubs. 

The 100 Feet Road in Indiranagar is synonymous with Bengaluru‚Äôs nightlife and social scene. It‚Äôs where people go to ‚Äúsee and be seen.‚Äù

3. VC money is here: 

A recent online post mentioned that most of the OG venture funds be it Kalaari  Capital or Peak XV have their offices here. It‚Äôs the money of Indiranagar that shakes the HSR / Koramangala Startup or the Techie + Indiranagar has that hipster vibe!  The neighborhood reflects Bengaluru‚Äôs identity‚Äîwhere coders, start-up founders, artists, and influencers coexist.


4. Stand-up Comedy and Instagram Culture

A lot of stand-up comics and Instagram influencers reference Indiranagar when talking about Bengaluru clich√©s‚Äîlike posh accents, yoga moms, artisanal coffee, or over-the-top rents. It‚Äôs often the ‚ÄúBandra‚Äù or ‚ÄúHauz Khas‚Äù of Bengaluru in jokes.

5. Real Estate and Gentrification Talk

Indiranagar also appears in discussions about gentrification, rising rent, and loss of old Bengaluru charm. So it‚Äôs a symbol of both aspiration and urban change.

In short, yes‚ÄîIndiranagar is a vibe, and a very meme-worthy one at that. 

Do you feel it too? While Malleshwaram and Jayanagar are the Old Bengaluru favourites, they aren‚Äôt the most popular areas amongst the pop culture crowd!  What are your thoughts!  ",1,1744213617.0,Bengaluru,0,0.67,False
1jv8z27,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LogoMotionGraphics/comments/1jv8z27/whats_the_turnaround_time_for_designing_a_motion/,What‚Äôs the turnaround time for designing a motion logo?,"
How Long Does It Take to Make a Motion Logo?

Ladies and gentlemen, let‚Äôs talk about motion logos.
That cute little animated thing that goes swish, pop, tadaaa right before your YouTube ad annoys everyone? Yeah, that.

You‚Äôd think it takes like‚Ä¶ what, an hour? Two? Just slap some After Effects on your logo, throw in a swoosh, maybe a sound like a soda can opening ‚Äî boom, done, right?

Wrong. So very wrong.


---

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Just a Few Seconds!‚Äù ‚Äî Said Every Client Ever

Let me break it to you gently: just because the motion logo lasts five seconds doesn‚Äôt mean it takes five seconds.

That‚Äôs like saying a wedding only takes 20 minutes, so the marriage must have taken 20 minutes to plan. (Ask any bride if she thinks that sounds accurate. I‚Äôll wait.)


---

From Zero to Whoa: The Actual Process

Let‚Äôs walk through the timeline:

1. Briefing and Discovery (1‚Äì2 Days)
You tell us you want ‚Äúsomething cool.‚Äù We ask if you mean ""cool"" like Marvel Studios or like an energy drink commercial. You send us your logo. We pretend it's not in Word format.


2. Concept and Storyboarding (2‚Äì3 Days)
We sketch ideas, test vibes, and debate whether your brand is more ‚Äúslide-in‚Äù or ‚Äúexploding origami.‚Äù This is also when we remember you wanted ‚Äúfun but professional but futuristic but classic.‚Äù


3. Design and Animation (3‚Äì5 Days)
Now we enter the animation cave. Coffee is consumed. Keyframes are manipulated. Music is synced. All while our computer fans sound like jet engines preparing for liftoff.


4. Revisions (1‚Äì2 Days)
You say ‚ÄúCan we make it pop more?‚Äù We translate that into motion design language. You then say, ‚ÄúActually‚Ä¶ can we go back to version 1?‚Äù We pretend that‚Äôs totally fine.




---

So‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs the Final Answer?

Typical turnaround time: 5 to 10 business days.
Unless you ask us to animate your logo to dance the Macarena in 3D with fireworks ‚Äî then we might need a few more.


---

What If I Need It Tomorrow?

Ah, the famous line:
‚ÄúCan you do it by tomorrow?‚Äù

Yes!
‚Ä¶if ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù is a metaphor for ‚Äúnext week.‚Äù

Otherwise, we enter express mode, where everything is possible ‚Äî for a small fee and a large pizza bribe.


---

In Summary:

A motion logo is not just some flashy flick ‚Äî it‚Äôs your brand‚Äôs handshake, wink, and mic drop rolled into five seconds. Give it time. Give it love. And whatever you do, don‚Äôt send your logo in a PowerPoint file.


---

Want a motion logo that makes people say ‚ÄúWhoa‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúWait, what was that?‚Äù
We got you. Just don‚Äôt ask for it overnight unless you‚Äôve also got cookies.

I've been using Perplexity Pro for a while now, and while I genuinely enjoy the service, there's one thing that's driving me absolutely crazy: that repetitive ""Thank you for being a Perplexity Pro subscriber!"" message that appears at the beginning of EVERY. SINGLE. RESPONSE.

Look, I appreciate the sentiment, but seeing this same greeting hundreds of times a day is becoming genuinely irritating. It's like having someone thank you for your business every time you take a sip from a coffee you already paid for.

I've looked through all the settings and can't find any option to disable this message. The interface is otherwise clean and customizable, but this particular feature seems hardcoded.

**What I've tried:**

* Searching through all available settings
* Looking for user guides or documentation about customizing responses
* Checking if others have mentioned this issue

Has anyone figured out a way to turn this off? Maybe through a browser extension, custom CSS, or some hidden setting I'm missing? Or does anyone from Perplexity actually read this subreddit who could consider adding this as a feature?

I love the service otherwise, but this small UX issue is becoming a major annoyance when using the platform for extended research sessions.",1,1744213344.0,perplexity_ai,3,1.0,False

Needing advice on curtains, dining chairs, coffee tables/side tables, lamps, ottoman for under piano, artwork,  and how to make the space cozier and not bland. 

Some styles I love- modern Parisian, traditional, eclectic, art deco, coastal, French country, Hollywood. 

Styles i would prefer not to have in my home- wabi Sabi, modern/ contemporary, industrial, MCM, glam, japandi, boho, minimalist or Scandinavian, regency/victorian.

1jv8sqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliancerepair/comments/1jv8sqo/voltage_transformer_advice/,Voltage transformer advice üò≠,"Hello Reddit folks! 
My husband‚Äôs birthday just passed, and I reaaaally wanted to get him a new coffee machine (he was using a free De‚ÄôLonghi one that he got some years ago second hand I think), so I got him the Barista Touch Impress. 

They didn‚Äôt have a dark coloured option where I‚Äôm at (in Singapore) and so I sourced the olive one from the US, but didn‚Äôt realise that there was a difference in wattage / voltage! 

It‚Äôs been a huge bummer. And a very expensive one, considering the shipping and USD to Singapore Dollar. 

It is still BRAND NEW and in the box. We noticed the wire and our hearts broke! 

Anyone here has had any experience using a step down transformer for your Brevilles? 

The machine is 110v / 2000w. 
In Singapore the voltage is 240v. 

I‚Äôve heard that I could get a 3000w step down transformer, but that the 60hz (Singapore) vs 50hz (US) phase might be an issue too. 

Should I even be considering using this transformer as an option?

1jv8s8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/FizzCard/comments/1jv8s8g/some_of_our_most_common_faqs/,Some of our most common FAQs,"**Q: Does Fizz check your credit when you sign up?**

A: No! It's one of the great things about Fizz. No more getting rejected just because you don't have credit history. While you still have to apply, we look at your historical bank account data and other factors to determine your eligibility.

**Q: How is Fizz different than a credit card?**

A: At the core, Fizz builds your credit much like a credit card or a loan ‚Äì¬†you have a line of credit, you pay back what you spend on it, and if you pay on time, your credit score should increase over time. The differences are that most credit cards make it easy for you to mess up. They have interest rates in case you can't pay your balance, they encourage you to spend more than you have, they're gatekept if you don't already have credit history...the list goes on. Fizz, on the other hand, gives you a credit limit based on what you have in your bank account to keep you from overspending, we don't check your credit, we don't even *have* interest rates, and our app has budgeting and education tools built in to help you become better financially :)

  
**Q: How much does Fizz cost?**

A: Less than you might think. While other cards might be free, interest rates and charges for returned or late payments can stack up. With Fizz, you can get a Membership for a low annual fee of $129.99 or $59.99 per year (and even less if you find a coveted invite code üòâ). That's less than a cup of coffee or a burrito every month! It's how we afford to keep the lights on at Fizz and keep offering great rewards.

**Q: Rewards! What rewards?!**

With a Fizz card you'll get 3% cash back in a category of your choice (that you can change every week if you want to). You'll also have access to our Fizz Friday offers, which pay out at 50% or more cash back *every single Friday.* It's easy to earn and easy to earn back that Membership fee while building credit.

**Q: I have more questions. Where can I find answers?**

A: While you can always check out [joinfizz.com/resources](http://joinfizz.com/resources) or [help.joinfizz.com](http://help.joinfizz.com), don't hesitate to ask your questions right here in our dedicated subreddit!

1jv8qgu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jv8qgu,"Want Vivian, have 176 pulls, but Trigger and Aftershock... (check my math)","See my posted images for available Polychrome sources. 

Hey ya'll! I have 176 pulls available and I'm saving up for Vivian

BUT I assume Aftershock effect bonuses and just an off-fielder /secondaries like Trigger is very valuable (like Astra, but also Lucy, Seth, and Nicole, and Rina).

What are the chances I could nab Trigger now and then get Vivian... Let's find out!

**TL;DR**: lol no way fam. I'd need 28k Polychromes and I estimate I MAYBE could get 11,500 by the end of her banner, and that's with doing just about everything.

Just gonna save for Vivian and level up Pulchara for her Aftershock effect if I REALLY want to.

I need another electric anyways (such as Rina or Harumasa) to get better team comps for Deadly Assault.

**How much I need**

Lets assume the worst-case scenario: losing the first Trigger 50/50 and getting her on the second guaranteed S Rank, then the same for Vivian.

I have 81 pulls for my first Guaranteed Trigger Banner S Rank in the 50/50. So I'd need 171 pulls to guarantee getting Trigger.

Then another 180 pulls to guarantee getting Vivian. So that's 351 pulls. 

So I have 176, so I need 175, and that's (x160 Polychromes)... **28k Polychromes.**


**How Much Time I Have**

It's it all but confirmed that Vivian is coming in 1.7 phase 1, before Hugo in phase 2, so we have 13 days (until April 22nd).

Then we have the 1.7 phase 1 banner, which will last 21 days (from April 23rd until May 13th).

So I have 34 days max to achieve enough Polychromes.

**What are my daily sources of Polychromes and how much can I get from them?**

I pay for the $5/mo Inter-Knot membership and get the Silver New Eridu City Fund when I reach lv 30 (which I seem to always do).

I've already maxxed the current eridu fund and got to lv 45 before trigger appeared, so none from that. But the next one I could probably get all of the benefits before the Vivian banner ends, so that's 8.875 pulls from that, or **1,420 Polychromes**

The inter-knot membership gives me 90 Polychromes daily, so that'd be **3060 Polychromes**

I always do my dailies (Video store, scratch off, coffee, and then HIA or Routine Cleanup), so that's **2040 Polychromes**

So far that's **6,520 Polychromes, or 40.75 pulls**.


**End-Game Content**

- Shiyu Defense (assuming all S Rank): 90 Polychromes x 7 nodes = 630 Polychromes, or 3.93 pulls
   - the Next Shiyu Defense starts this Friday, Apr 11th, and resets every other Friday, so I'll get in 3 before the Vivian banner ends, so, **1890 Polychromes or 11.81 pulls**

- Deadly Assault (assuming 4 stars because I need to git gud): 200 Polychromes, or
    - I haven't done the current Deadly assault, which ends on Thursday, April 17th, and resets every 2 weeks. I'll only get this and the next deadly assault before V's banner ends, so that's **400 Poly, or 2.5 Pulls**.
    - I could get another 200 Polychromes between the two deadly assaults if I git gud and can get 6 stars total.


**Other Sources**
- HDD: I haven't done any HDD story hard mode and have a ton of combat and exploration commissions which give about 30 Polychromes each.
    - estimated 35 combat and exploration missions: 35 x 30 =  1050 Polychromes + 3 Rally commissions (at 60 each), or **1230 Poly, or 7.68 Pulls**
    - estimated 33 hard mode story missions at 20 poly per, so  **660 poly, or 4.13 pulls**

- Events
    - 500 Poly from Trigger's missions
    - 300 from Little Knight
    - Potentially 500 from Vivian's story
    - Potentially 500 from some other event.

**Summary**

LOL nah. I'd need 28k for guaranteed and I'd only get about 11.5k if I did *everything*.

Just gonna save for Vivian and level up Pulchara for her Aftershock effect if I REALLY want to.

1jv8p7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/spongebob/comments/1jv8p7e/unpopular_opinion_the_bizarro_sequence_in/,"Unpopular Opinion: The Bizarro Sequence in ""InSPONGEiac"" was way better than the one in ""Squidward in Clarinetland""","I believe this to be true for numerous reasons and I'll list them in bullet point format.

1. The reasoning makes sense, SpongeBob is tired, just drank a bunch of coffee and is running until he passes out. All of those reasons equates a good introduction to a bizarro sequence. We can also see that he closes his eyes right before he starts having these visions meaning that he could already be asleep and is just dreaming about all of his prior events that day that either fueled or did no effect into combating his insomnia. Compared with Squidward in Clarinetland where Squidward doesn't have a reason that relates to the story other than the fact that he's trying to stop SpongeBob from messing with his clarinet.

2. Relates. Everything in this sequence in InSPONGEiac relates to everything in the boundaries of the story and it wasn't just a collaboration of random sequences like in Squidwarfd in Clarinetland where all of the sequences weren't backed up with events from the episoed that moved the plot forward and was filled with complete randomness. Here's some examples that prove my point, The scene starts when SpongeBob thinks he sees a sea troll yelling at him, which was in the story Patrick read to him to help him go to sleep, but then he shakes his head and realizes he's talking to a bush. He sees a billboard that advertised milk and he later said ""Why SpongeBob, why did you drink me?"" Remembering that SpongeBob drank the warm milk in an attempt to help him fall asleep, but then it squirted out of his holes. It also serves as a foreshadow for what's coming up in the sequence. We see Mr. Krabs eyes turning into mustard as he's chasing SpongeBob screaming ""You're wasting all me mustard, profits!"" which happens at the beginning of the episode and is the introduction as to how he became an insomniac. Then Squidward warns him that Mr. Krabs will be angry if he doesn't get some sleep, and then Patrick eats him thinking he's a sponge cake (which also happened when SpongeBob was waking him up from his sleep). Then he falls and crashes into a bed which smashes from the impact of him falling, the sun rises, SpongeBob pleads for some sleep and then we see Sir Cecil the sleeping wizard, the magic wizard in his book sprinkle some magic dust onto SpongeBob and finally comes to his senses with the surroundings around him and gets out of his vision. Point being, everything in this sequence is pretty much either a foreshadow of events that's going to come after SpongeBob wakes up or were events that happened prior and had parallels in the episode leading him to have insomnia. Compared to Squidward in Clarinetland, where a bald eagle that swallows him, he gets sucked inside a vacuum cleaner, gets shot inside a pinball machine and chases SpongeBob into outer space in all attempts to catch SpongeBob as he's running around laughing with his clarinet. None of those events were talked about in the episode and it just seemed like a bunch of randomness that didn't connect with each other or were mentioned in his reasoning that was 100% mentioned off screen.

3. The length. I'm going to keep this one brief, but the length of each of these bizarro sequences have an impact on the attention span of the story and in my opinion, the one in InSPONGEiac was much shorter and attention grabbing than the one in Squidward in Clarinetland with being a minute and a half shorter. I remember when this episode aired, I was bored a minute and a half into the Squidward in Clarinetland episode with all the unrelated randomness and non-driven plot devices that I won't repeat again. Whereas in the InSPONGEiac episode, I was wondering if SpongeBob was going to eventually get some sleep and hopefully get his insomnia cured. Well he never did which I hated, I wish the episode found a cure for it but the visuals and short length drew me in.

  
Long story short, I see a lot of comparisons between these two sequences and I think it's pretty clear that in my opinion, the one from InSPONGEiac was executed much much better than the one in Squidward in Clarinetland. What do you guys think? Did you like the one in Squidward in Clarinetland better or the one in InSPONGEiac more?",1,1744212833.0,spongebob,0,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**

I have to go for the plus money here, friends. Not only have the Mets won their last 6 straight games, but they‚Äôve also won the first two games in this series by at least 2 runs. Today, they send ace pitcher Tylor Megill (0.87 ERA) to the mound, who has logged a win in both of his starts so far this season. To boot, the Mets have also won each of Megill‚Äôs starts by at least 2 runs. I‚Äôm on New York to complete their sweep of the Marlins today and cover the RL at home.

I consume about 2-3 packs a months, so my plan is to keep 2 packs on hand, and freeze the 8 bags left, and take them out the freezer progressively (no refreezing, of course)

My questions are the following: 

1. Can I simply pop the bags in the freezer, as is? And pop them out when a new bag is needed?

2. Should I tape the 1-way valve before freezing them ? 

3. Should I go as far as to vacuum seal the coffee beans before freezing ? (which would mean opening the bags and transferring the beans into specific plastic bags)

1jv8hrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1jv8hrj/my_first_experience_with_what_i_felt_as_true/,"My first experience with what I felt as, true presence.","I‚Äôve been practicing spirituality and following this path since about Junior year of college. I‚Äôm now 24, and I have experienced my first spiritual ‚Äúawakening‚Äù or feeling of total aliveness within my whole body.

I first stumbled across spirituality when I was looking up ways to help my relationship with my significant other. I was plagued with what I now see as depression and ways to escape my mind. I was smoking weed everyday, ordering fast food to my dorm every night (literally), and staying up to the late night hours playing video games. I was lying to her about what was wrong and it impacted our relationship. 

During this search to help my relationship, I stumbled across Eckhart Tolle and his Essential Teachings podcasts. Since the first episode that I listened to, it spoke to me. I could immediately sense the truth in what he spoke and it drew me in further to these practices and teachings. I was never religious, and I also thought spirituality was silly, weird, and foreign. I had no real inner purpose to my life. Just chasing the short gratifications whenever I could.

Just like everyone‚Äôs spiritual journey, mine was and still is on and off and I obviously would live in my mind when not focused on these teachings. But when I listened to his words, I felt at peace.

I would try to meditate here and there, walk through a forest, really observe the trees and beauty of what stillness they had- and imagined it within myself. At that time, I thought the feeling I had in my body was presence and aliveness. Maybe it was, but a very small amount. 

I would go into my life and my challenges, and what I‚Äôve had to overcome- but that would turn this post into a book. I‚Äôm really here to just talk about my experience.
‚Äî
I got ‚ÄúThe power of now‚Äù a few weeks ago when I was trying to obtain knowledge of how to overcome my anxiety and relationship I had with my mother. I was going to therapy at the time and he was familiar with Eckhart Tolle and once he related to me, instead of listening to podcasts on and off, I decided to get the book.

I didn‚Äôt start REALLY reading it until a couple days ago. My morning routine is going to a coffee shop, getting a cup of coffee, pulling out my book, and reading it and underlining and taking notes on things that stood out to me.

It wasn‚Äôt until I got to a chapter which was explaining a meditative practice on how to feel the aliveness in your body and how to feel your ‚Äúinner body‚Äù.

I started going to this spot by a creek near my apartment that is completely- for the most part- isolated. I started going out there to skip rocks and be alone with my thoughts. It is very peaceful.

There is this small stone that sits right on the edge of the water that aligns with these jagged rocks in the middle of the creek that are stacked, creating a rapid with crashing water that added to the immense peacefulness. I would hear birds and would sometimes run into others just talking near this creek surrounded by trees and nature.

When I first saw that stone I said to myself, ‚Äúwhat a place to meditate‚Äù. At that point in my life, I wasn‚Äôt meditating and only tried it a couple times in college.

Well yesterday, after reading about the inner body in the power of now, I went out there to try this meditative practice he talks about step by step. I sat on the stone.

I closed my eyes and watched and observed the thoughts that would cross my mind. Usually they would be ‚Äúwhat if someone comes down here and sees me sitting here‚Äù, ‚Äúthat would be so weird‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat if someone comes down here and stabs me in the back‚Äù. I was unable to make my mind still. I continued to sit there and observe these thoughts without judgement. Eventually, I felt the small aliveness in my body (still following the steps he mentioned). I kept focusing on that feeling and feeling every part in my body. Every vibration, every sound around me, and imagined myself as a ball of light with light slowly seeping out and shining aside that creek. I came to a point where there were no thoughts after about what felt like an hour sitting there. There were not even thoughts of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any thoughts‚Äù. My mind was incredibly still. I sat like that for more time, and SOME thoughts would quickly zip across my mind, and I watched them fade in my own mind. There was nothing. I sat there longer while feeling this incredible aliveness in my body, and following his instructions, slowly opened my eyes and looked at the trees, the water, and the nature all around me. 

I was immediately met with an intense vibration AROUND ME and WITHIN me. I was incredibly fearful and wanted to stand up immediately. Everything around me looked foreign and I was to say plainly, scared shitless. I didn‚Äôt think this at the time cause it was just fear, but the closest thing I can relate to is a panic attack where your whole body is vibrating and you feel nauseous. There was no nausea, but that‚Äôs what it felt like and probably what my mind related it to.

I tried to keep this feeling after the initial fear, and it only lasted a couple seconds. I looked around and admired nature. And the stillness and beauty of everything. It slowly subsided but I still felt this vibration within my whole body. While I was sitting there, still with this feeling, I saw a wasp land near me and buzz around. I have extreme phobia to bees and wasps and again, I wanted to stand up and move away, but I didn‚Äôt. This was a conscious decision. Instead of being succumbing to the fear, I sat there and looked at this creature without trying to label it. It was drinking water and flying around and eventually it left. Shortly after that I got up once comfortable, grabbed my book and phone, and walked back up the steps that led to this area, and back to my car about a quarter mile away. Still feeling this vibrational and peaceful sensation. Eventually I got back to my car and sat in my car with my thoughts. I took the book, and journaled about this feeling and looked up reasons on why I felt that intense amount of fear when I opened my eyes. Although I got some answers, I‚Äôm not going to act like that I have the answers or achieved something spectacular.
-
I‚Äôm not going to be ‚Äúchasing this feeling‚Äù that I experienced. But it almost doesn‚Äôt feel real.

I just wanted to share my experience and I‚Äôm not looking for recognition or anything like that.  Afterwards I wanted to share with a few friends that aligned with my path of spirituality, but I didn‚Äôt want to give into the egoic mind of wanting to share and receive some type of recognition or have them want me to talk about it more. This is my own personal journey and I understand that now more than ever. After some thought, instead of sharing to my close friends, I‚Äôm deciding to share it here.

Let me save you from my past suffering. Here‚Äôs what NOT to do:

**Mistake #1:** *Picking products like a raccoon picks trash.*  
I promoted a ‚Äúself-stirring coffee mug‚Äù that‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt stir. *Surprise!*  
**Fix:** Only sell stuff YOU‚ÄôD buy. (If you wouldn‚Äôt sip from a haunted mug, skip it.)

**Mistake #2:** *Using hooks like ‚ÄúHey guys, today I‚Äôm‚Ä¶‚Äù*  
*Snooze.* TikTok‚Äôs algorithm yeeted my videos into the void.  
**Fix:** Start with ‚ÄúHOLD MY PHONE‚Äî‚Äù or ‚ÄúI almost got FIRED for this‚Ä¶‚Äù Drama = views.

**Mistake #3:** *Trying to do everything alone like a hermit crab.*  
Spoiler: Hermit crabs die a lot.  
**Fix:** Join a group where people share:

* *What‚Äôs trending* (so you‚Äôre not selling snow boots in July).
* *How to fix glitches* (like the ‚ÄúVerify Your Soul‚Äù TikTok loop).
* *Free templates* (so you don‚Äôt reinvent the wheel).

**Why This Works:**  
I joined a community(10K+) with actual humans (no bots, no aliens‚Ä¶ as of yet). They roast bad product ideas (RIP self-stirring mug) and share daily trending lists. My sales went from ‚Äúpocket change‚Äù to ‚ÄúI can afford groceries *and* WiFi.‚Äù

**Slide me a message if you want the group link.**  
*(No pressure‚ÄîI‚Äôm not a used-car salesman. But if you‚Äôre tired of yelling into the TikTok void, hit me up.)*

My wife (30 MtF) and I (30M) have been together for 9 years now. We moved in together 3 weeks after we met figuring we'd either work it out or we wouldn't, and are now common law partners. We wear the rings, signed an affidavit, and call each other husband and wife but never had a wedding because we don't know anybody.

My wife was raised in the Philippines and moved to Canada at 18. I'm sure it's obvious that growing up trans in the Philippines would be less than great. She was physically and sexually abused from the age of 5 by those both inside and outside her family until she moved in with me at 21. Escaping her abusive family was a large part of why we moved her in with me so quickly.

I understood going in that she had a lot of trauma (not the extent) and some immature or unhealthy habits; they just always seemed like something we could work on as we go and if we broke up over any of them we'd at least have had a good time along the way.

My wife has made an incredible amount of progress in the time we've been together:  
\- Getting her reassignment surgery  
\- Upgrading highschool courses to get accepted into university  
\- Acing 2 years of biochemistry at university  
\- Excelling in and completing a respiratory therapy program in college and becoming a RT

I've been super happy to support her through all of this, as well as sharing some of my passions with her through teaching her about some of my hobbies.

Almost 2 years ago now she was diagnosed with DID and everything has gotten much more complicated.

She has never had a healthy way to deal with conflict, but with her DID it's now become clear that that is because it isn't \*her\* responding. It's one of a small army of angry child-versions of her furiously trying to defend her and keep her safe from things that do not pose a real threat to her.

9 years in she gets defensive over things that she should know better than to worry about from me and her version of defense is aggression, gaslighting, and eventually threatening self-harm and/or love-bombing and begging for forgiveness before I've had time to process anything.

I'm really struggling with feeling like a complete asshole for holding her accountable for the things that aren't really her, but I'm also having a hard time figuring out where the line in the sand should be drawn that enough is enough and I need to leave. If I don't figure out where the line into too much is, I worry that I'm not respecting myself enough to insist on being treated reasonably.

All of this has become extra clear to me because of my relationship with my best friend (F28). My best friend and I met playing a D&D game online, where we'd started talking after sessions; she'd tell me what was going on with her life and eventually I started noticing patterns in her husband's behavior that didn't seem healthy. We started a spreadsheet of all the shit he did, and eventually despite her traumatic upbringing she saw past the facade and recognized that her husband was physically, sexually, and financially abusing her. She's now in the process of leaving her husband, which is great; Less great is that I've gotten really good about picking out narcissistic patterns of behavior and haven't been happy with my wife's treatment of me for some time.

A few weeks ago, my friend came to visit for some time to breathe before actually leaving her husband. She lives over a 15 hour drive and across an international border away. She also has two young daughters and is decidedly not my type; which my wife knows. Despite all this, my wife gets insecure about her just because she's a cis-gendered woman. She keeps trying to convince herself that I'm lying about being child-free and would be happier with my friend because she can (and does already) have kids.

During this trip there was one particularly active day where we all went out. My friend and wife went out for coffee together; we all got breakfast; we all got tattoos; and we went around a couple local tourist-y places downtown. My wife and I don't get downtown very often and she was understandably excited, but my friend has hip issues and I'd just gotten a significant tattoo on my calf that was bleeding a lot and causing me a lot of pain. Eventually we decided to go back to the car but my wife was bouncing around getting entirely too dramatic and excited over things that just weren't that exciting. I told her I'd appreciate her toning it down a bit because I couldn't keep up while in pain and she threw a tantrum accusing us of excluding her all day and gave me the silent treatment for the 40 minute drive home. She eventually admitted that she hadn't felt excluded during any of our activities and that one of her alters had attacked me because she felt judged.

Later in the week my wife threw a fit over the fact that my friends elbow might have touched mine while all three of us shared a couch to watch a movie. This eventually led to her throwing her head into a wall and trying to overdose on a bunch of pills. Luckily, the 8-year-old alter doesn't know which of her pills are actually harmful and she did not take any pills that would cause her harm in a meaningful dosage, but self-harm is my only real trigger and she knows it.

There was another instance of her getting upset about something I'd said about a dress (after she'd explicitly asked about the dress) where she inferred something that wasn't said, thanked me for clarifying, then still gave me the silent treatment for 40 minutes on our way to a movie and told me that she understood that I hadn't said anything hurtful but that I was still wrong because she'd been upset.

I'm at the point where it's hard for me to talk to her because she gets upset over things that I haven't even said and accuses me of things that I haven't done. It's incredibly difficult for me to develop any feelings of intimacy because I can't share anything with her because every conversation is another opportunity for her to latch onto something that she almost willfully misunderstands so that she can play the victim.

I do still love her. The regular and conscious version of my wife is my favorite person, but I'm not living with \*just\* that version. I'm living with her moment-to-moment actions.

Her therapist suggests that I need to get to know her alters and ask them by name to send her back out when they come out, but I have ADHD and have an extremely strong justice sensitivity. It's hard for me to stop and consider what's going on when she's actively attacking me; I get defensive instead.

Her therapist also recommends couples counseling, but specifies that we need to get a therapist who is familiar with DID because ""otherwise, they'll just accuse (wife) of abuse"", as if her behavior isn't abusive.

I'm struggling because I am not as susceptible to this kind of abuse as others. My best friend was raised mormon by an abusive family and her sense of self is almost non-existent. She is impacted \*so heavily\* by everything anyone says or does to her and I'm just not. I've gotten through 9\~ years of this just fine, generally happy, even; but now that I'm seeing the patterns it's a lot harder to accept things day-by-day.

I'm not good with emotional decisions and I'm having a really hard time turning drawing my line in the sand into a rational one that I'll be able to feel good about.

I tried going to therapy (which I can't afford to do long-term because I'm currently between jobs) and when I asked ""How long am I supposed to put up with this?

-------------------------------------------------------------------

There‚Äôs something undeniably charming about retro desserts, and the Jello ice cream recipe stands out as a bright and colorful classic that has delighted generations. This fun treat combines the wobbly delight of Jello with the creamy goodness of ice cream, creating a visually stunning dessert that is perfect for family gatherings, parties, or simply as a nostalgic treat. If you‚Äôre ready to take a trip down memory lane, here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to making your own Jello ice cream.

### What You'll Need

- 1 box of your favorite flavored Jello (3 oz)
- 2 cups boiling water
- 1 cup crushed ice
- 1 cup vanilla ice cream (softened)
- 1 cup whipped topping (optional)
- Mixing bowl
- Whisk or spoon
- Freezer-safe dish or mold

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: Dissolve the Jello

Begin by boiling 2 cups of water. Once it reaches a rolling boil, pour the water into a mixing bowl and add the dry Jello powder. Stir the mixture until the Jello is completely dissolved. This usually takes about 2 to 3 minutes. The vibrant color and aroma of the Jello will instantly transport you back to your childhood!

#### Step 2: Add Ice

Once your Jello is ready, add 1 cup of crushed ice to the bowl. Stir until the ice is melted and the mixture thickens slightly. This step cools down the mixture and helps it set a bit faster.

#### Step 3: Combine with Ice Cream

Now comes the fun part! Gently fold in 1 cup of softened vanilla ice cream into the Jello mixture. If you‚Äôre feeling indulgent, you can also add 1 cup of whipped topping for an extra creamy texture. Fold everything together until you achieve a smooth consistency, ensuring that the colors blend beautifully without losing the mixture's airy quality.

#### Step 4: Mold the Mixture

Transfer your colorful Jello ice cream mixture into a freezer-safe dish or mold. If you want to create a layered effect, pour half the mixture into the dish and freeze it for about 30 minutes before adding another layer. This allows for a fun presentation when you scoop it out later.

#### Step 5: Freeze

Cover the dish and place it in the freezer for at least 4 hours, or until it‚Äôs completely firm. If you plan to keep it overnight, be sure it‚Äôs well-covered to avoid freezer burn. When freezing, your kitchen will likely fill with echoes of laughter and excitement as everyone awaits this delightful treat.

### Serving Your Retro Delight

Once your Jello ice cream is ready, remove it from the freezer. For easiest serving, let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes. This allows it to soften slightly so that scooping becomes easier.

Use a scooper to serve the Jello ice cream into bowls, and consider garnishing with extra whipped topping, sprinkles, or fresh fruit for an added touch. Watch as everyone‚Äôs eyes light up with joy at the sight of this nostalgic dessert!

### Tips for Customization

- **Flavor Combinations:** Feel free to experiment with different flavors of Jello and ice cream. Try cherry Jello with chocolate ice cream or lime Jello with coconut.
- **Add-Ins:** Enhance the texture by adding mini marshmallows, chocolate chips, or crushed candy bars into the mix before freezing.
- **Presentation:** Use fun molds to create unique shapes that will appeal to children and adults alike. Star-shaped or heart-shaped molds can make for delightful servings.

Revisit the joy of childhood with this Jello ice cream recipe. It‚Äôs an easy, engaging, and colorful treat that will surely impress family and friends. So gather your ingredients, get creative in the kitchen, and enjoy every sweet, nostalgic bite!

1jv80xn,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1jv80xn/the_spookysplorers98_case/,The SpookySplorers98 Case,"My name is Faith Bowman. I am a detective with the Louisiana State Police. At least‚Ä¶ I am right now. Truth be told, once this story is out there, I will probably be fired. The higher-ups will know I was the one who leaked this story, name attached to it or not, but I refuse to stay quiet on this. I saw what happened to those children. People need to know the truth. The parents need to know. Something has to be done.

Four weeks ago, I was placed on a multi-case missing persons investigation in New Orleans. The people missing were three young teenagers: 14-year-old Austin Gill, 14-year-old Cecil York, and 13-year-old Kamran Roth. All three boys were reported missing on the same day by the children‚Äôs parents. A connection was quickly drawn between the three disappearances due to the three boys being close friends for many years and sharing a hobby of making and posting videos on a YouTube channel referred to as ‚ÄúSpookySplorers98‚Äù.

According to the boys‚Äô parents and my personal watching of the channel‚Äôs content, SpookySplorers98 was a channel dedicated to a style of content that has begun trending on the internet over the past few years referred to as ‚Äúanalog horror‚Äù. From my understanding, the content is about telling scary stories through the lens and limitations of older, outdated technology. The parents told me that the boys were very passionate about this hobby, going as far as to purchase an old camcorder, record the videos, and convert the film to digital before editing the video and posting it online in order to capture the most ‚Äúauthentic feel‚Äù.

The boys only had two videos on their channel; one of them was a video of the boys going through the woods looking for Bigfoot, and the other video was of the boys exploring an abandoned barn that the parents informed me was on Austin‚Äôs uncle‚Äôs property. In both videos, Austin and Cecil were present and on camera. As the videos went on and ‚Äúscary‚Äù things happened, it was clear that Kamran was most likely just off-screen, making haunting noises and throwing things around, something that was later confirmed to me by Kamran‚Äôs parents. While the content was not made for people in my demographic, the boys were very talented, and you could see the passion they put into their hobby. When questioned about where the boys might have gone, both the Gills and Yorks did not have an answer, however, the Roth parents believed they might have an idea.

The boys were determined to go record at a documented ‚Äúhaunted‚Äù location. While New Orleans is known for many paranormal and spiritual places, Kamran couldn‚Äôt stop mentioning one specific location: the Lindy Boggs Medical Center. The Lindy Boggs Medical Center is an abandoned hospital on the northern end of the city. He would constantly bring up how they should make a video there and how cool it would be, but his parents understandably refused, pointing out the dangers of the building. While the hospital is very popular with urban explorers, it is also known to be a hot spot for drug deals, homeless, and junkies. The Roths told me that if I should look for the boys, the hospital might be the best place to start.

Soon after this, I had a police unit scouring the hundreds of rooms in search of the missing boys. After a few hours of searching, a police officer brought me a promising sign, a JVC GR-AXM230 camcorder. The battery was dead, but the appearance of the camera perfectly matched the description of the boys‚Äô camera given by the parents. I sent it off to evidence with the orders to have the contents of the camera converted to film so that the content could be reviewed. The rest of the hospital was searched, but no other signs of the boys were found.

By the end of the day, I had a fresh VHS tape sitting on my desk with a label stuck to it containing the case file‚Äôs number. I was instructed to watch the tape, transcribe the details of the footage, and look for anything that might clue us in on what happened to the missing children. I dug the old rolling television with VHS player from the back of a storage closet, sat down with a cup of coffee, and popped the tape into the player. The box television crinkled to life with a static hum before the tape began to play.

The following is a copy of the tape‚Äôs transcription:

\--------------------------------------------------

(Footage opens with a close-up of Cecil York‚Äôs face. He is squinting as a light shines in his eyes. The time marked in the corner reads 10:42 p.m. Cecil swats at the camera.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúAh! Austin cut it out! You know that flashlight‚Äôs bright!‚Äù

Austin (laughing): ‚ÄúWhat? I just needed to make sure the lighting was good.‚Äù

(Austin shakes the light more, causing Cecil to squint harder. The camera then pans around to show the outside of the Lindy Boggs Medical Center.)

Austin: ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm thinking we‚Äôll shoot the intro out here and then move inside for the next shot.‚Äù

Kamran: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when I‚Äôll come in?‚Äù

(Austin turns the camera to show Kamran.)

Austin: ‚ÄúExactly. Gotta set up the atmosphere first. So, for this first shot, you just sit back and hold still. Don‚Äôt want people pointing out there being three footsteps this time. Cecil, you come over here and walk a little in front of me.‚Äù

(Cecil steps into the left frame of the picture.)

Austin: ‚ÄúAlright, here we go.‚Äù

(The two boys slowly start approaching the building quietly. The camera pans up to reveal a sign that reads ‚ÄúMedical Center‚Äù.)

Austin: ‚ÄúSo we are here at the Lindy Boggs Medical Center. This place is known for all sorts of paranormal activity. Me and Cecil are currently working our way inside with the hopes of catching some ghosts on camera. Hopefully, we‚Äôll uncover the secrets of this mysterious place. We‚Äôll catch back up with y‚Äôall once we‚Äôre inside.‚Äù

(Austin stops walking.)

Austin: ‚ÄúOk, that should be good. Let‚Äôs find a way into the‚Ä¶‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

(Camera cuts to black. The time in the corner now reads 10:55 p.m. A crunching sound is heard before a light illuminates a hallway on the inside of the medical center.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúWoah! This is so cool!‚Äù

(The camera turns to show Austin looking into the medical center through a broken window.)

Austin: ‚ÄúOk, once I hop through, we‚Äôll walk down the hall. Then we‚Äôll look around for weird creepy stuff to film.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúGotcha.‚Äù

(Austin jumped down into the building from the window. The camera panned, and they slowly made their way down the hallway.)

Austin: ‚ÄúAlright. We‚Äôve made it inside the building. As you can see this place is already super creepy. Let‚Äôs look around and see what we can find‚Ä¶ Ok. That‚Äôs good.‚Äù

(Camera cuts to the next scene.)

**Report Note**: Kamran was not present in this scene. Most likely, he waited outside until the shot was finished. Kamran does appear in later shots.

\--------------------------------------------------

(The next shot shows the camera shining over an old hospital room. Broken glass and litter cover the floor. The time reads 10:59 p.m.)

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts to a close up shot of a small pile of broken glass and used needles. The time reads 11:00 p.m.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúGotta watch our step out here.‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

(The next shot is another hospital room, this time with a destroyed bed frame in the middle of the room. The time reads 11:10 p.m. ¬†Austin‚Äôs voice can be heard behind the camera.)

Austin: ‚ÄúGod, this place is freaky.‚Äù

Cecil (somewhere further away): Guys! Come check this out!

\--------------------------------------------------

(Image cuts to a new room. Time reads 11:13 p.m. The room is still decrepit and old. However, the trash on the floor had all been pushed to the walls, leaving the middle of the floor relatively clear. There on the floor, a large red pentagram was marked.)

**Report** **Note**: Due to the low resolution of the camera, it is unclear if the mark is paint, chalk, or some other substance. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the symbol was here before the boys arrived at the location or if the boys made this symbol themselves for the video.

Austin: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so cool‚Ä¶ No, I don‚Äôt like that let me try-‚Äù

(Camera cuts.)

\--------------------------------------------------

(Camera reopens over the pentagram. Time reads 11:13 p.m.)

Austin: ‚ÄúWoah‚Ä¶ Nice find.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúWhat do you think it‚Äôs doing here?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúProbably people trying to summon ghosts or something.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this.‚Äù

(A sudden crashing sound is heard behind the camera. The camera shakes and turns to face the empty doorway.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Let‚Äôs go check it out.‚Äù

(The camera moves towards the doorway and turns to show Kamran.)

Austin: ‚ÄúPerfect! Good job, Kamran. Let‚Äôs look for a nice open spot for the next shot.‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts to black. The time reads 11:22 p.m. Inaudible whispers and quiet hushes can be heard.)

Austin (whispering): ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear anything.‚Äù

Cecil (whispering): ‚ÄúHow? It literally sounded like someone threw something down the hall.‚Äù

Kamran (whispering): ‚ÄúIs there someone else in here? I thought you said our parents were lying about there being a bunch of people in here.‚Äù

Austin (whispering): They are. They only say that stuff about there being like murderers and pedos in here because they think the roof is gonna like collapse one day, and they don‚Äôt want us in here when it does. But that‚Äôs not gonna happen for like a hundred years.‚Äù

Cecil (whispering): ‚ÄúStick the camera out in the hallway and see if you see anything.‚Äù

(Camera moves out to the hallway. Outside streetlights provide minimal visibility at the end of the hall.)

**Report** **Note**: While the light visibility and camera quality are incredibly poor. A small amount of movement can be seen at the end of the hall just as the camera is moved out of the room. This is only barely visible on a larger television screen and was most likely not noticed by the boys on the small playback screen of the camcorder.

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts to a shot of the hallway illuminated by a flashlight. The time reads 11:25 p.m. the boys‚Äô footsteps on broken glass can be heard.)

Kamran (whispering): ‚ÄúI think we should go.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúYou were the one that suggested this place. There‚Äôs no one here. Even if there was, there are like three of us. Nobody is gonna mess with us.‚Äù

Kamran (whispering): ‚ÄúBut what about the noises?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúYou saw the video. There was nothing there. This building‚Äôs old as shit, stuff creaks and fall all the time.‚Äù

Kamran (whispering): ‚ÄúThe camera didn‚Äôt show anything 'cause it‚Äôs dark. If someone was standing there, we wouldn‚Äôt have seen it.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúSo what? You want to go back and not finish the video? We‚Äôre here now already dude. I‚Äôm not going till we finish the video.‚Äù

Cecil (whispering): ‚ÄúOk, look. I say we stay and film, but let‚Äôs work quick and wrap things up. This will already be our best video.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúSure, yeah. That‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

(The camera and flashlight turn to illuminate a nearby hospital room with an old destroyed wheelchair inside.)

Kamran (whispering and sounding nervous): ‚ÄúYeah, ok. Let‚Äôs just make it quick.‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

(Video cuts to the camera bobbing quickly down the hallway with Austin to the right of the screen. Time reads 11:30 p.m.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúAre you sure it‚Äôs this way?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, right down here.‚Äù

(A crash can be heard further down the hallway.)

Austin: ‚ÄúThat room! Go!‚Äù

(The camera bobs violently before quickly turning into the room. The camera pans over 3 of the four corners of the empty room.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs the ghost toying with us like this?‚Äù

(Brief pause.)

Austin: ‚ÄúCool. So, we‚Äôll-‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts and opens with the camera being propped up against something, along with the light. The room is much more open than the previous rooms in the footage. The rooms seem to be filled with pipes, wires, and toilets. A dark hallway with doors to patient rooms can be seen in the background. The time reads 11:42 p.m. All three boys are seen in the picture.)

Austin: ‚ÄúOk so I think this‚Äôll be perfect, but I need to check back at this shot to make sure everything‚Äôs in frame. So, you and I will be talking about what we saw and heard, Kamran will make some noise in that room over there, we‚Äôll go check it out, we step in, I shake the camera, and we scream. That will be the end of the video.‚Äù

**Report** **Note**: While talking, a faint movement can be seen at the edge of the doorway. It is too dark to tell what it could be.

Kamran (visibly nervous): ‚ÄúDo I have to go in there? Can‚Äôt I just throw something into the room?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúPeople will see the object going into the room. It has to be in a place where they can‚Äôt see.‚Äù

Kamran: ‚ÄúI really want to get out of here, Austin.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúOk! Then go in the room and make some noise.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúAustin, chill. It‚Äôs ok.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúNo! It‚Äôs the last thing, dude. Perfect finale. I don‚Äôt understand the big deal. Like I‚Äôll never ask you to do anything like this again, man. Just one little thing, and then we are out of here.‚Äù

Kamran: ‚ÄúOk, fine. You have like one take though, ok?‚Äù

Austin (putting hands in prayer motion): ‚ÄúThank you! It‚Äôs gonna be great!‚Äù

(Austin reaches for the camera before it the image cuts.)

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts back to the same position. This time, only Austin and Cecil are present in the frame. The time reads 11:47 p.m.)

Austin: ‚ÄúOk. Here we go‚Ä¶ Alright. All in all, I think this was a pretty good search of the facility.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúI agree. Hopefully, the audio turns out good and we‚Äôll be able to hear all the strange noises.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it will be fine. But I believe we might have uncovered something much more sinister with that pentagram on the ground. Perhaps someone is trying to keep the ghosts locked in here with some horrible spell.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs why the place has never been torn down despite the obvious health risk.‚Äù

Austin (looking agitated): ‚ÄúExactly. And to add to that‚Ä¶ what if‚Ä¶ Ok Kamran! You‚Äôre supposed to be making noise by now! Don‚Äôt give us two long to talk.‚Äù

(The two boys stare at the door in silence.)

Austin: ‚ÄúLook, I know you said one take, but since you messed this one up, we will do one more.‚Äù

(The two boys sit in silence again.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúKamran, you aren‚Äôt scaring us.‚Äù

(Austin grabs the camera and light and walks across the room to the door.)

Austin: ‚ÄúSeriously, dude! You were crying about wanting to leave, and now you are just-‚Äù

(The camera enters the room. In the back left corner of the hospital room is the figure of an emaciated man hunched over with his back turned to the camera. What little clothes he is wearing are tattered and in a state of disarray. His skin is incredibly pale, and his head is completely bald. His left hand is held over the mouth of the deceased body of Kamran Roth. The man‚Äôs head is craned over the boy‚Äôs neck, head bobbing in an animalistic chewing motion. The camera begins to shake.)

Austin (whispering): ‚ÄúHoly shit. Oh my god. Oh my god.‚Äù

(The man slowly turns his head, his ears abnormally large for his head. He has a scrunched small nose, his face covered in wrinkles, and a prominent thick brow ridge. His eyes reflected the light, giving them a glowing yellow appearance. The man slowly stands up and turns to face the two boys. His mouth and chin are covered in blood. It appears he was gnawing at Kamran‚Äôs neck. The man‚Äôs arms and fingers seem abnormally long. His stomach appears bloated. He stands with a hunch. The man appears older, but due to the man‚Äôs abnormal face and shape, I cannot confidently estimate his age.)

**Report** **Note**: Despite the thorough investigation of the Lindy Boggs Medical Center, no recent blood of the victims was found.

Cecil (yelling): ‚ÄúRun, Austin! Run!‚Äù

(The camera turns and shakes violently as the two boys run down the hallway. The footage is hard to make out due to low resolution and shaking, but you can see the boys twisting and turning down hallways for around three and a half minutes. The camera eventually steadies for a moment as it looks down the hallway with the broken window at the end that the boys used to enter the building.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúCome on! Come on! We got to get out of-‚Äù

(As Cecil nears the end of the hallway, the man steps out of a hospital room adjacent to Cecil‚Äôs left. The man grabs Cecil by the neck and lifts him into the air with one hand, pinning him against the wall.)

**Report** **Note**: After replaying and tracking the route the boys took and cross referencing it with the layout of the building, there is no way in my understanding that the man could have reached that room to ambush the boys before the boys reached the window. It would have required him to either run past the boys without the boys noticing or being picked up on the camera or crawl through the small ventilation shaft faster than two teenage boys could sprint a much shorter distance.

**Report** **Note**: Given this shot is both closer and gives Cecil as a reference point for size. I estimate the man must be at least 6‚Äô2‚Äù. The man appears to have thin white hair on the man‚Äôs arms and back. This further supports the man being older, however, he moves with a speed and strength that does not resemble his age.

(Cecil screams as the man holds him. The wrinkled skin on the man‚Äôs head stretches back for his mouth to open wider than what would appear possible. The man bites down on Cecil‚Äôs neck hard enough to cause Cecil‚Äôs neck to begin bleeding profusely. The man‚Äôs mouth appears to make a sucking motion. Austin turns and runs back down the hallway. He runs for about 45 seconds before sharply turning into a dark room. The camera is placed on something before Austin turns his flashlight off. Austin can be heard panting before breaking out into quiet sobs. This goes on for about 2 minutes before Austin suddenly stops. Footsteps can be heard coming down the hallway outside the room.)

(After a few moments, the sound of footsteps stops close to the camera. The camera picks up what appears to be the sound of sniffing. Austin begins to sob again.)

Austin (crying): ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry sir‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll leave‚Ä¶ Please‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll leave, and I won‚Äôt tell anyone. I swear‚Ä¶ Please God‚Ä¶‚Äù

(The footsteps rush into the room, and the sounds of a struggle can be heard. The camera tips over and falls to the ground, facing the doorway. The silhouette of the man dragging Austin out of the room can be seen. Austin‚Äôs screams and inaudible pleads can be heard moving farther away from the camera for around 3 minutes before abruptly stopping.)

(The camera remains in the location without incident for the rest of the footage.)

\--------------------------------------------------

*End of transcript*

After finishing the tape, I immediately ran to my lieutenant and informed him that this was something he needed to see. I took him to the room and rewound the tape to the moment the gaunt man showed up. My lieutenant watched in both horror and amazement of the brutality of the man the boys captured on tape.

‚ÄúWe need to contact the FBI,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúClearly, we‚Äôre dealing with some kind of serial killer who cannibalizes his victims. But then there‚Äôs the trick with him getting in that room. I don‚Äôt have any idea how he could have made it there in time to ambush them like that. And his mouth‚Ä¶ what the hell was that?‚Äù

My lieutenant stood up and began walking out of the room.

‚ÄúI need you to remain here, detective. I‚Äôm going to make a few phone calls about this matter and then I‚Äôll tell you where we go from here.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù I replied.

I waited in the room for about 45 minutes before my lieutenant reentered the room, his face pale and eyes worried.

‚ÄúHow many people have seen this video?‚Äù he asked quietly as he took the tape out of the VHS player.

‚ÄúSo far? Just us, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk.‚Äù He said sternly. ‚ÄúListen to me closely, Bowman; For the time being, you are not allowed to talk about this tape or the contents in it to anyone. Understand?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù I replied quickly

While I found his attitude was odd, it is normal for details on a case to be kept quiet while the case is being investigated or handed off to a larger agency. I filed the transcript away in my desk and was placed on a different New Orleans homicide case the next day. I figured I would soon be given more information about what happened with the case or see on the news that the FBI had found the guy. But as days turned to a week, and a week turned into four, I realized that I might not be receiving the closure I wanted on this case after all.

I came into the office early one morning. I scrolled through the daily emails from the children‚Äôs families asking for updates, wanting to know if we had found any sign of their boys. It hurt me to lie to them. To tell the terrified parents that we were doing everything we could to try and find their boys alive and well, knowing that it would never happen. I mindlessly opened my internet browser and typed in ‚ÄúSpookySplorers98 YouTube‚Äù and pressed enter‚Ä¶ No results found. Confused, I Googled the boys‚Äô names in hopes of finding a news report on them missing‚Ä¶ Nothing. I pulled out my phone and did the same, assuming that there was something wrong with my computer, but I was greeted with the same lack of results. I returned to my work computer and opened up our case file database. My stomach was beginning to tie itself into knots as I typed out the case file number into the search bar and pressed enter‚Ä¶ ‚Äú0 Results Found‚Äù. With the exception of the parents‚Äô emails, it was as though the boys‚Äô case never existed.

I stood up and made my way to my lieutenant‚Äôs office. Something was happening with the boys‚Äô case, and it felt wrong. I needed answers, and he would most likely have some insight into the matter. As I stepped into his office, my lieutenant glanced up from some papers he was reading before continuing the perusal of his paperwork.

‚ÄúDetective Bowman,‚Äù he said calmly, ‚Äúwhat can I do for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSir,‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúI need to talk to you about the missing children‚Äôs case from a few weeks ago.‚Äù

His eyes shot up from his paper, his brow furrowed at me.

‚ÄúSir,‚Äù I continued, ‚Äúall mention of the case is gone. Not just from normal search engines, but from our database as well. It‚Äôs like the case didn‚Äôt ever exist.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were told not to talk about this matter.‚Äù he said firmly.

‚ÄúAnd I haven‚Äôt. But this is way bigger than just some missing persons case. Those children are dead, and I have no reassurance that anything is being done about it. Hell, the damn medical center has no additional barricades put up to keep people out. That‚Äôs an active crime scene, and any homeless person or drug addict can just walk in off the street and start tampering with evidence.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt get that reassurance from me, detective.‚Äù He spoke quietly but sharply. ‚ÄúAll I can tell you, and even this is pushing it, is that this case was sent way higher up than either of us expected. They told me that the situation was ‚Äòdelicate‚Äô and that going forward, the case is to be treated as though it didn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù

My lieutenant was sweating now, nervous over the whole ordeal.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve already asked them, Bowman.‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI asked them if anything would be done, if the families could get some closure. They told me not to worry about what may or may not be done. But they told me that under no circumstances will the family know the details of what happened.‚Äù

I stepped back, taking in what my lieutenant had just said. He hung his head and spoke softly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Bowman. I really am‚Ä¶ I know this is bothering you. God knows it‚Äôs bothering me too. Take the day. Go for a walk. Clear your head about.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù I whispered softly.

I turned and slowly walked to the door.

‚ÄúDetective,‚Äù my lieutenant spoke, ‚Äúyou did nothing wrong. These things happen sometimes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù I replied.

I walked to my desk somberly. I slowly put small items into my purse, being sure to be inconspicuous as I took out the tape‚Äôs transcript from my desk and slipped the papers into my bag. After it was secured, I walked out of the building and went for a walk.

I don‚Äôt know what the importance is of the thing that killed those boys, but I refuse to live life on the idea that *maybe* someone else will do something about it. I refuse to let those parents go on for the rest of their lives wondering what happened to their children. I don‚Äôt know who said what to my lieutenant that made him so scared as to overlook the butchering of three children, but whatever it was, it wasn‚Äôt said to me.",2,1744211168.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

1jv7zf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1jv7zf9/the_spookysplorers98_case/,The SpookySplorers98 Case,"My name is Faith Bowman. I am a detective with the Louisiana State Police. At least‚Ä¶ I am right now. Truth be told, once this story is out there, I will probably be fired. The higher-ups will know I was the one who leaked this story, name attached to it or not, but I refuse to stay quiet on this. I saw what happened to those children. People need to know the truth. The parents need to know. Something has to be done.

Four weeks ago, I was placed on a multi-case missing persons investigation in New Orleans. The people missing were three young teenagers: 14-year-old Austin Gill, 14-year-old Cecil York, and 13-year-old Kamran Roth. All three boys were reported missing on the same day by the children‚Äôs parents. A connection was quickly drawn between the three disappearances due to the three boys being close friends for many years and sharing a hobby of making and posting videos on a YouTube channel referred to as ‚ÄúSpookySplorers98‚Äù.

According to the boys‚Äô parents and my personal watching of the channel‚Äôs content, SpookySplorers98 was a channel dedicated to a style of content that has begun trending on the internet over the past few years referred to as ‚Äúanalog horror‚Äù. From my understanding, the content is about telling scary stories through the lens and limitations of older, outdated technology. The parents told me that the boys were very passionate about this hobby, going as far as to purchase an old camcorder, record the videos, and convert the film to digital before editing the video and posting it online in order to capture the most ‚Äúauthentic feel‚Äù.

The boys only had two videos on their channel; one of them was a video of the boys going through the woods looking for Bigfoot, and the other video was of the boys exploring an abandoned barn that the parents informed me was on Austin‚Äôs uncle‚Äôs property. In both videos, Austin and Cecil were present and on camera. As the videos went on and ‚Äúscary‚Äù things happened, it was clear that Kamran was most likely just off-screen, making haunting noises and throwing things around, something that was later confirmed to me by Kamran‚Äôs parents. While the content was not made for people in my demographic, the boys were very talented, and you could see the passion they put into their hobby. When questioned about where the boys might have gone, both the Gills and Yorks did not have an answer, however, the Roth parents believed they might have an idea.

The boys were determined to go record at a documented ‚Äúhaunted‚Äù location. While New Orleans is known for many paranormal and spiritual places, Kamran couldn‚Äôt stop mentioning one specific location: the Lindy Boggs Medical Center. The Lindy Boggs Medical Center is an abandoned hospital on the northern end of the city. He would constantly bring up how they should make a video there and how cool it would be, but his parents understandably refused, pointing out the dangers of the building. While the hospital is very popular with urban explorers, it is also known to be a hot spot for drug deals, homeless, and junkies. The Roths told me that if I should look for the boys, the hospital might be the best place to start.

Soon after this, I had a police unit scouring the hundreds of rooms in search of the missing boys. After a few hours of searching, a police officer brought me a promising sign, a JVC GR-AXM230 camcorder. The battery was dead, but the appearance of the camera perfectly matched the description of the boys‚Äô camera given by the parents. I sent it off to evidence with the orders to have the contents of the camera converted to film so that the content could be reviewed. The rest of the hospital was searched, but no other signs of the boys were found.

By the end of the day, I had a fresh VHS tape sitting on my desk with a label stuck to it containing the case file‚Äôs number. I was instructed to watch the tape, transcribe the details of the footage, and look for anything that might clue us in on what happened to the missing children. I dug the old rolling television with VHS player from the back of a storage closet, sat down with a cup of coffee, and popped the tape into the player. The box television crinkled to life with a static hum before the tape began to play.

The following is a copy of the tape‚Äôs transcription:

\--------------------------------------------------

(Footage opens with a close-up of Cecil York‚Äôs face. He is squinting as a light shines in his eyes. The time marked in the corner reads 10:42 p.m. Cecil swats at the camera.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúAh! Austin cut it out! You know that flashlight‚Äôs bright!‚Äù

Austin (laughing): ‚ÄúWhat? I just needed to make sure the lighting was good.‚Äù

(Austin shakes the light more, causing Cecil to squint harder. The camera then pans around to show the outside of the Lindy Boggs Medical Center.)

Austin: ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm thinking we‚Äôll shoot the intro out here and then move inside for the next shot.‚Äù

Kamran: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when I‚Äôll come in?‚Äù

(Austin turns the camera to show Kamran.)

Austin: ‚ÄúExactly. Gotta set up the atmosphere first. So, for this first shot, you just sit back and hold still. Don‚Äôt want people pointing out there being three footsteps this time. Cecil, you come over here and walk a little in front of me.‚Äù

(Cecil steps into the left frame of the picture.)

Austin: ‚ÄúAlright, here we go.‚Äù

(The two boys slowly start approaching the building quietly. The camera pans up to reveal a sign that reads ‚ÄúMedical Center‚Äù.)

Austin: ‚ÄúSo we are here at the Lindy Boggs Medical Center. This place is known for all sorts of paranormal activity. Me and Cecil are currently working our way inside with the hopes of catching some ghosts on camera. Hopefully, we‚Äôll uncover the secrets of this mysterious place. We‚Äôll catch back up with y‚Äôall once we‚Äôre inside.‚Äù

(Austin stops walking.)

Austin: ‚ÄúOk, that should be good. Let‚Äôs find a way into the‚Ä¶‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

(Camera cuts to black. The time in the corner now reads 10:55 p.m. A crunching sound is heard before a light illuminates a hallway on the inside of the medical center.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúWoah! This is so cool!‚Äù

(The camera turns to show Austin looking into the medical center through a broken window.)

Austin: ‚ÄúOk, once I hop through, we‚Äôll walk down the hall. Then we‚Äôll look around for weird creepy stuff to film.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúGotcha.‚Äù

(Austin jumped down into the building from the window. The camera panned, and they slowly made their way down the hallway.)

Austin: ‚ÄúAlright. We‚Äôve made it inside the building. As you can see this place is already super creepy. Let‚Äôs look around and see what we can find‚Ä¶ Ok. That‚Äôs good.‚Äù

(Camera cuts to the next scene.)

**Report Note**: Kamran was not present in this scene. Most likely, he waited outside until the shot was finished. Kamran does appear in later shots.

\--------------------------------------------------

(The next shot shows the camera shining over an old hospital room. Broken glass and litter cover the floor. The time reads 10:59 p.m.)

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts to a close up shot of a small pile of broken glass and used needles. The time reads 11:00 p.m.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúGotta watch our step out here.‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

(The next shot is another hospital room, this time with a destroyed bed frame in the middle of the room. The time reads 11:10 p.m. ¬†Austin‚Äôs voice can be heard behind the camera.)

Austin: ‚ÄúGod, this place is freaky.‚Äù

Cecil (somewhere further away): Guys! Come check this out!

\--------------------------------------------------

(Image cuts to a new room. Time reads 11:13 p.m. The room is still decrepit and old. However, the trash on the floor had all been pushed to the walls, leaving the middle of the floor relatively clear. There on the floor, a large red pentagram was marked.)

**Report** **Note**: Due to the low resolution of the camera, it is unclear if the mark is paint, chalk, or some other substance. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the symbol was here before the boys arrived at the location or if the boys made this symbol themselves for the video.

Austin: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so cool‚Ä¶ No, I don‚Äôt like that let me try-‚Äù

(Camera cuts.)

\--------------------------------------------------

(Camera reopens over the pentagram. Time reads 11:13 p.m.)

Austin: ‚ÄúWoah‚Ä¶ Nice find.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúWhat do you think it‚Äôs doing here?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúProbably people trying to summon ghosts or something.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this.‚Äù

(A sudden crashing sound is heard behind the camera. The camera shakes and turns to face the empty doorway.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Let‚Äôs go check it out.‚Äù

(The camera moves towards the doorway and turns to show Kamran.)

Austin: ‚ÄúPerfect! Good job, Kamran. Let‚Äôs look for a nice open spot for the next shot.‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts to black. The time reads 11:22 p.m. Inaudible whispers and quiet hushes can be heard.)

Austin (whispering): ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear anything.‚Äù

Cecil (whispering): ‚ÄúHow? It literally sounded like someone threw something down the hall.‚Äù

Kamran (whispering): ‚ÄúIs there someone else in here? I thought you said our parents were lying about there being a bunch of people in here.‚Äù

Austin (whispering): They are. They only say that stuff about there being like murderers and pedos in here because they think the roof is gonna like collapse one day, and they don‚Äôt want us in here when it does. But that‚Äôs not gonna happen for like a hundred years.‚Äù

Cecil (whispering): ‚ÄúStick the camera out in the hallway and see if you see anything.‚Äù

(Camera moves out to the hallway. Outside streetlights provide minimal visibility at the end of the hall.)

**Report** **Note**: While the light visibility and camera quality are incredibly poor. A small amount of movement can be seen at the end of the hall just as the camera is moved out of the room. This is only barely visible on a larger television screen and was most likely not noticed by the boys on the small playback screen of the camcorder.

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts to a shot of the hallway illuminated by a flashlight. The time reads 11:25 p.m. the boys‚Äô footsteps on broken glass can be heard.)

Kamran (whispering): ‚ÄúI think we should go.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúYou were the one that suggested this place. There‚Äôs no one here. Even if there was, there are like three of us. Nobody is gonna mess with us.‚Äù

Kamran (whispering): ‚ÄúBut what about the noises?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúYou saw the video. There was nothing there. This building‚Äôs old as shit, stuff creaks and fall all the time.‚Äù

Kamran (whispering): ‚ÄúThe camera didn‚Äôt show anything 'cause it‚Äôs dark. If someone was standing there, we wouldn‚Äôt have seen it.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúSo what? You want to go back and not finish the video? We‚Äôre here now already dude. I‚Äôm not going till we finish the video.‚Äù

Cecil (whispering): ‚ÄúOk, look. I say we stay and film, but let‚Äôs work quick and wrap things up. This will already be our best video.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúSure, yeah. That‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

(The camera and flashlight turn to illuminate a nearby hospital room with an old destroyed wheelchair inside.)

Kamran (whispering and sounding nervous): ‚ÄúYeah, ok. Let‚Äôs just make it quick.‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

(Video cuts to the camera bobbing quickly down the hallway with Austin to the right of the screen. Time reads 11:30 p.m.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúAre you sure it‚Äôs this way?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, right down here.‚Äù

(A crash can be heard further down the hallway.)

Austin: ‚ÄúThat room! Go!‚Äù

(The camera bobs violently before quickly turning into the room. The camera pans over 3 of the four corners of the empty room.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs the ghost toying with us like this?‚Äù

(Brief pause.)

Austin: ‚ÄúCool. So, we‚Äôll-‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts and opens with the camera being propped up against something, along with the light. The room is much more open than the previous rooms in the footage. The rooms seem to be filled with pipes, wires, and toilets. A dark hallway with doors to patient rooms can be seen in the background. The time reads 11:42 p.m. All three boys are seen in the picture.)

Austin: ‚ÄúOk so I think this‚Äôll be perfect, but I need to check back at this shot to make sure everything‚Äôs in frame. So, you and I will be talking about what we saw and heard, Kamran will make some noise in that room over there, we‚Äôll go check it out, we step in, I shake the camera, and we scream. That will be the end of the video.‚Äù

**Report** **Note**: While talking, a faint movement can be seen at the edge of the doorway. It is too dark to tell what it could be.

Kamran (visibly nervous): ‚ÄúDo I have to go in there? Can‚Äôt I just throw something into the room?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúPeople will see the object going into the room. It has to be in a place where they can‚Äôt see.‚Äù

Kamran: ‚ÄúI really want to get out of here, Austin.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúOk! Then go in the room and make some noise.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúAustin, chill. It‚Äôs ok.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúNo! It‚Äôs the last thing, dude. Perfect finale. I don‚Äôt understand the big deal. Like I‚Äôll never ask you to do anything like this again, man. Just one little thing, and then we are out of here.‚Äù

Kamran: ‚ÄúOk, fine. You have like one take though, ok?‚Äù

Austin (putting hands in prayer motion): ‚ÄúThank you! It‚Äôs gonna be great!‚Äù

(Austin reaches for the camera before it the image cuts.)

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts back to the same position. This time, only Austin and Cecil are present in the frame. The time reads 11:47 p.m.)

Austin: ‚ÄúOk. Here we go‚Ä¶ Alright. All in all, I think this was a pretty good search of the facility.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúI agree. Hopefully, the audio turns out good and we‚Äôll be able to hear all the strange noises.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it will be fine. But I believe we might have uncovered something much more sinister with that pentagram on the ground. Perhaps someone is trying to keep the ghosts locked in here with some horrible spell.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs why the place has never been torn down despite the obvious health risk.‚Äù

Austin (looking agitated): ‚ÄúExactly. And to add to that‚Ä¶ what if‚Ä¶ Ok Kamran! You‚Äôre supposed to be making noise by now! Don‚Äôt give us two long to talk.‚Äù

(The two boys stare at the door in silence.)

Austin: ‚ÄúLook, I know you said one take, but since you messed this one up, we will do one more.‚Äù

(The two boys sit in silence again.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúKamran, you aren‚Äôt scaring us.‚Äù

(Austin grabs the camera and light and walks across the room to the door.)

Austin: ‚ÄúSeriously, dude! You were crying about wanting to leave, and now you are just-‚Äù

(The camera enters the room. In the back left corner of the hospital room is the figure of an emaciated man hunched over with his back turned to the camera. What little clothes he is wearing are tattered and in a state of disarray. His skin is incredibly pale, and his head is completely bald. His left hand is held over the mouth of the deceased body of Kamran Roth. The man‚Äôs head is craned over the boy‚Äôs neck, head bobbing in an animalistic chewing motion. The camera begins to shake.)

Austin (whispering): ‚ÄúHoly shit. Oh my god. Oh my god.‚Äù

(The man slowly turns his head, his ears abnormally large for his head. He has a scrunched small nose, his face covered in wrinkles, and a prominent thick brow ridge. His eyes reflected the light, giving them a glowing yellow appearance. The man slowly stands up and turns to face the two boys. His mouth and chin are covered in blood. It appears he was gnawing at Kamran‚Äôs neck. The man‚Äôs arms and fingers seem abnormally long. His stomach appears bloated. He stands with a hunch. The man appears older, but due to the man‚Äôs abnormal face and shape, I cannot confidently estimate his age.)

**Report** **Note**: Despite the thorough investigation of the Lindy Boggs Medical Center, no recent blood of the victims was found.

Cecil (yelling): ‚ÄúRun, Austin! Run!‚Äù

(The camera turns and shakes violently as the two boys run down the hallway. The footage is hard to make out due to low resolution and shaking, but you can see the boys twisting and turning down hallways for around three and a half minutes. The camera eventually steadies for a moment as it looks down the hallway with the broken window at the end that the boys used to enter the building.)

Cecil: ‚ÄúCome on! Come on! We got to get out of-‚Äù

(As Cecil nears the end of the hallway, the man steps out of a hospital room adjacent to Cecil‚Äôs left. The man grabs Cecil by the neck and lifts him into the air with one hand, pinning him against the wall.)

**Report** **Note**: After replaying and tracking the route the boys took and cross referencing it with the layout of the building, there is no way in my understanding that the man could have reached that room to ambush the boys before the boys reached the window. It would have required him to either run past the boys without the boys noticing or being picked up on the camera or crawl through the small ventilation shaft faster than two teenage boys could sprint a much shorter distance.

**Report** **Note**: Given this shot is both closer and gives Cecil as a reference point for size. I estimate the man must be at least 6‚Äô2‚Äù. The man appears to have thin white hair on the man‚Äôs arms and back. This further supports the man being older, however, he moves with a speed and strength that does not resemble his age.

(Cecil screams as the man holds him. The wrinkled skin on the man‚Äôs head stretches back for his mouth to open wider than what would appear possible. The man bites down on Cecil‚Äôs neck hard enough to cause Cecil‚Äôs neck to begin bleeding profusely. The man‚Äôs mouth appears to make a sucking motion. Austin turns and runs back down the hallway. He runs for about 45 seconds before sharply turning into a dark room. The camera is placed on something before Austin turns his flashlight off. Austin can be heard panting before breaking out into quiet sobs. This goes on for about 2 minutes before Austin suddenly stops. Footsteps can be heard coming down the hallway outside the room.)

(After a few moments, the sound of footsteps stops close to the camera. The camera picks up what appears to be the sound of sniffing. Austin begins to sob again.)

Austin (crying): ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry sir‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll leave‚Ä¶ Please‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll leave, and I won‚Äôt tell anyone. I swear‚Ä¶ Please God‚Ä¶‚Äù

(The footsteps rush into the room, and the sounds of a struggle can be heard. The camera tips over and falls to the ground, facing the doorway. The silhouette of the man dragging Austin out of the room can be seen. Austin‚Äôs screams and inaudible pleads can be heard moving farther away from the camera for around 3 minutes before abruptly stopping.)

(The camera remains in the location without incident for the rest of the footage.)

\--------------------------------------------------

*End of transcript*

After finishing the tape, I immediately ran to my lieutenant and informed him that this was something he needed to see. I took him to the room and rewound the tape to the moment the gaunt man showed up. My lieutenant watched in both horror and amazement of the brutality of the man the boys captured on tape.

‚ÄúWe need to contact the FBI,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúClearly, we‚Äôre dealing with some kind of serial killer who cannibalizes his victims. But then there‚Äôs the trick with him getting in that room. I don‚Äôt have any idea how he could have made it there in time to ambush them like that. And his mouth‚Ä¶ what the hell was that?‚Äù

My lieutenant stood up and began walking out of the room.

‚ÄúI need you to remain here, detective. I‚Äôm going to make a few phone calls about this matter and then I‚Äôll tell you where we go from here.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù I replied.

I waited in the room for about 45 minutes before my lieutenant reentered the room, his face pale and eyes worried.

‚ÄúHow many people have seen this video?‚Äù he asked quietly as he took the tape out of the VHS player.

‚ÄúSo far? Just us, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk.‚Äù He said sternly. ‚ÄúListen to me closely, Bowman; For the time being, you are not allowed to talk about this tape or the contents in it to anyone. Understand?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù I replied quickly

While I found his attitude was odd, it is normal for details on a case to be kept quiet while the case is being investigated or handed off to a larger agency. I filed the transcript away in my desk and was placed on a different New Orleans homicide case the next day. I figured I would soon be given more information about what happened with the case or see on the news that the FBI had found the guy. But as days turned to a week, and a week turned into four, I realized that I might not be receiving the closure I wanted on this case after all.

I came into the office early one morning. I scrolled through the daily emails from the children‚Äôs families asking for updates, wanting to know if we had found any sign of their boys. It hurt me to lie to them. To tell the terrified parents that we were doing everything we could to try and find their boys alive and well, knowing that it would never happen. I mindlessly opened my internet browser and typed in ‚ÄúSpookySplorers98 YouTube‚Äù and pressed enter‚Ä¶ No results found. Confused, I Googled the boys‚Äô names in hopes of finding a news report on them missing‚Ä¶ Nothing. I pulled out my phone and did the same, assuming that there was something wrong with my computer, but I was greeted with the same lack of results. I returned to my work computer and opened up our case file database. My stomach was beginning to tie itself into knots as I typed out the case file number into the search bar and pressed enter‚Ä¶ ‚Äú0 Results Found‚Äù. With the exception of the parents‚Äô emails, it was as though the boys‚Äô case never existed.

I stood up and made my way to my lieutenant‚Äôs office. Something was happening with the boys‚Äô case, and it felt wrong. I needed answers, and he would most likely have some insight into the matter. As I stepped into his office, my lieutenant glanced up from some papers he was reading before continuing the perusal of his paperwork.

‚ÄúDetective Bowman,‚Äù he said calmly, ‚Äúwhat can I do for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSir,‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúI need to talk to you about the missing children‚Äôs case from a few weeks ago.‚Äù

His eyes shot up from his paper, his brow furrowed at me.

‚ÄúSir,‚Äù I continued, ‚Äúall mention of the case is gone. Not just from normal search engines, but from our database as well. It‚Äôs like the case didn‚Äôt ever exist.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were told not to talk about this matter.‚Äù he said firmly.

‚ÄúAnd I haven‚Äôt. But this is way bigger than just some missing persons case. Those children are dead, and I have no reassurance that anything is being done about it. Hell, the damn medical center has no additional barricades put up to keep people out. That‚Äôs an active crime scene, and any homeless person or drug addict can just walk in off the street and start tampering with evidence.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt get that reassurance from me, detective.‚Äù He spoke quietly but sharply. ‚ÄúAll I can tell you, and even this is pushing it, is that this case was sent way higher up than either of us expected. They told me that the situation was ‚Äòdelicate‚Äô and that going forward, the case is to be treated as though it didn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù

My lieutenant was sweating now, nervous over the whole ordeal.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve already asked them, Bowman.‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI asked them if anything would be done, if the families could get some closure. They told me not to worry about what may or may not be done. But they told me that under no circumstances will the family know the details of what happened.‚Äù

I stepped back, taking in what my lieutenant had just said. He hung his head and spoke softly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Bowman. I really am‚Ä¶ I know this is bothering you. God knows it‚Äôs bothering me too. Take the day. Go for a walk. Clear your head about.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù I whispered softly.

I turned and slowly walked to the door.

‚ÄúDetective,‚Äù my lieutenant spoke, ‚Äúyou did nothing wrong. These things happen sometimes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù I replied.

I walked to my desk somberly. I slowly put small items into my purse, being sure to be inconspicuous as I took out the tape‚Äôs transcript from my desk and slipped the papers into my bag. After it was secured, I walked out of the building and went for a walk.

I don‚Äôt know what the importance is of the thing that killed those boys, but I refuse to live life on the idea that *maybe* someone else will do something about it. I refuse to let those parents go on for the rest of their lives wondering what happened to their children. I don‚Äôt know who said what to my lieutenant that made him so scared as to overlook the butchering of three children, but whatever it was, it wasn‚Äôt said to me.",1,1744211065.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Ex: Is milk in my coffee allowed? Am I allowed to have something sweet after my meal? Etc.

I feel like what, how, and why you eat what you do is a very personal thing‚Ä¶ 

Personally OMAD for me means fasting until dinner time then allowing a few calculated snacks/bites before turning in for the night. So maybe it‚Äôs technically 21:3 fasting but at the same time who actually cares what I call it? It works for me.

I fast everyday unless:

* I‚Äôm ill, pregnant, or breastfeeding.
* It is a holiday.
* I‚Äôm on vacation or family is visiting.
* I‚Äôm donating blood or there‚Äôs some medical test that requires me to eat.

I also take the time to check in with myself often. How am I feeling about my relationship with food? Am I happy with how the scale is trending/maintaining? Then I adjust my plan accordingly.

I feel like OMAD can be such a game-changer for some people depending on your goals and this subreddit is a treasure trove of great ideas, information, and inspiration. 

If you‚Äôre just starting out with OMAD, 20:4, or whatever style you want just set your personal ground rules and then adjust them as you go. 

Start with strict OMAD but realize it‚Äôs not working for you? Switch to 20:4 and see how you feel in a week or two.

Can‚Äôt survive without a bit of milk in your coffee? Try keeping your coffee the same but incorporating OMAD otherwise.

Maybe I‚Äôll get a lot of hate for this but you don‚Äôt have to completely follow some arbitrary rule for fasting to work for you. You don‚Äôt have to do KETO. You don‚Äôt have to give up alcohol. Yes you can still eat dessert every night if it‚Äôs important to you and aligns with your goals.

Everybody is different so one exact way of eating isn‚Äôt going to work for everyone. Just take the time and learn what works best for you.",10,1744210967.0,omad,3,0.92,False

Three Prompt Use Cases:

1. Breaking through the ""Ellis Island brick wall"" by analyzing passenger manifests, naturalization records, and hometown naming patterns to trace European ancestors back to their villages of origin.

2. Unraveling contradictory census records to determine if two similar names represent the same person or different individuals, using occupation, neighborhood patterns, and household composition as cross-reference points.

3. Reconstructing family connections disrupted by adoption, name changes, or separations during historical events like war, migration, or economic displacement.

Example user input for testing: ""I'm trying to trace my Italian great-grandfather who came to America around 1910. Family stories say his name was changed at Ellis Island from something like 'Rossi' to 'Ross'. I found someone with a similar name in the 1920 census in Brooklyn, but I'm not sure if it's him. How do I confirm this connection and trace him back to Italy?""

I've worn the Montagne Monkey Special on my skin, in the past, and really like it.  I need to find a good day to test them side by side on skin.  

Monkey Special is one of my favorites from Montagne.  At first, I wasn't sure I liked it, but after having it for a few months, it developed into a very unique scent.  It is boozy, spicy, cinnamony.  I can smell some incense in there, which I am probably associating with the patchouli.  The passionfruit seems pretty prominent to me.  I'm not getting any leather from the OG or the Montagne, but after smelling a lot of colognes from a lot of brands, I don't believe I correctly perceive whatever generates a ""leather"" scent in cologne.  Nothing I have smelled smells like leather to me, so I'm thinking it's a ""me"" problem and not a ""them"" problem.

I definitely think this is going to be a ""love it or hate it"" scent, and not something easy to wear or mass appealing.  I'm a big dude, with a big beard and long hair, so I think it fits me pretty well.  This is definitely one I would recommend trying a decant of, on your skin, prior to buying.  It is also very strong and seems to project well.  My girlfriend does not like the OG or the Montagne.  I didn't think she would, since she doesn't like strong fragrances.

I think the Montagne version gets very close to the original.  The original does seem a little more dense, dark, and mysterious.  It seems like there is a chocolate and/or a coffee note in it, that the Montagne is missing.  It isn't one of the main notes and is very subtle, but I do like the OG better with those extra notes.  The Montagne version is almost a ""Monkey Special Cologne"", being lighter and airier than the OG.  I'm wondering if spraying an extra spray of the Montagne would get it even closer, but I still think it is missing a little bit of subtle ""extra"" that the OG has.

Is the Xerjoff worth an extra money?  If I was rich, I would probably go with the OG.  It does smell a little bit better, and I really do thing the ""missing"" notes compared to the Montagne add to my overall enjoyment of the scent.  In the air, I'm not sure if anyone would notice.  If I was going to wear this daily, I may even be able to justify the extra price.  As this is definitely not something I would wear daily, and as good as the Montagne one smells, if I had to choose one to buy a full bottle of, with my own money, I would buy the Montagne.  I do like having a decant of the OG though, for when I want a little extra something with it.",9,1744210401.0,MontagneParfums,0,1.0,False
1jv7phn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarbonCopyGaming/comments/1jv7phn/goggames_puts_filter_in_place_and_its_all_wrong/,GOG-games puts filter in place and its all wrong - Negative filtering manifesto.,"The good will of the gog-games owner is only washed out with his lack of understanding on how search engines work.


He did the right thing: added filters to the site so users can find things easier.NOT. It was a long standing issue and request in that site yet this man somehow screwed up. 
It was easy, the idea of filters is per se a ""negative one"" meaning you want to subtract content to be able to see a more specific, focused content; well this guy and his aide programmer thought ""meh let's just let them find a tag"", then they added a positive (in all senses) filter and let me tell you how it works.

You click on the tags you want to see, but here is the catch: you click two tags and those two tags must be in the game to be shown. How retarded is that?. In these days a 2D fighter might get mixed with visual novels, yet (probably) fighter consumers don't like visual novels and vice versa (yet I promise you these games exist anyway). With the actual filters both are OBLIGED to see each others ""bad games"". With negative filters they could live their peaceful lives without harming each other. 


Not only the positive filters are rather stupid in general, because you may not know what you like but you do know what you don't like.
This simple statement is what you could call ""optimized browsing experience"".


When you go to a grocery store, you know you want cookies; now... which ones? the ones with chocolate? crackers? or who knows what other flavors are there that you don't know!. With a smart search you immediately can tell that those ""orange flavored"" are horrible and the rest are worse than you thought. Luckily our brain let us filter by finding coincidences to be able to do so; for example ""citric flavors"" are not your thing and it happens that ""brand A"" is devoted to making citric flavored cookies. Bingo! negative filters in place, you simply ignore all that brand has to offer (at least for cookies).


This mundane example happens in internet too. When you want to find something different but you don't know exactly what it is, you start doing negative filtering to remove what you DO know you don't like and this way you can have a cleaner browsing experience.


Come on! haven't you seen those amazing browser extensions that let you block, blacklist and filter entire domains in the results of the  search engines and all its ad riddled results taking you to amazon, ebuy and such places when you where searching for a mouse driver?


Enter the TAG system. 
It has been abused, it is implemented wrong %99 of the times by letting users (mostly kids or people without an idea) tag products. The idea is to put words that describe the product. The idea people have on these is completely subjective (shouldn't be). So for some, the game is a ""visual novel"" but for others, its a ""life simulator"" or even ""has coffee mugs"" (go to wallhaven to see this in action, search ""mug"" see the results) and ""life simulator"" scope is in the vicinity of ""farmer rpgs"" or ""space sci fi rpg simulators"" so you end up with any kind of game when trying to filter. If everyone is stupid enough to tag everything with well... everything ..the tag system cancels itself, simple as that; you search for ""simulator"" and get ""visual novels"" and ""farming RPGs"".


But wait! not all is lost and tags are the only thing you can use now to filter stuff. Yes it sucks because its bad implementations but there are some tags that are ""real"" so if you are smart enough (grocery example) you know what to take out to more or less have a close to ""ok"" experience.


Now back to the main thing; here is an example of bad implementation: ""Positive filtering"".


Positive filters stack up on ""positive tags""= tags you DO want to see. What is the issue? well, you will likely not find any games with all the positive tags you chose, since all those have to be in the same game to be shown in the search. It stacks on conditions. It is a rock-ages old way to search. It is like a tool to find non-existing products. This is why at least you want to disengage the ""stacking"" behaviour and just show ""any games with any of those tags"" instead of ""games with all these tags"". 


Guess what was done in gog-games?...


Now, things get worse because as I've said, positive tags only serve the purpose of searching specific things but they are not suitable for browsing new stuff. In other words; ""you know what you want and don't care about new stuff you don't know about"". Because you are searching stuff you want to see but happily ignore things you don't know.

Enter negative filtering and the things change: you now tell the search engine you don't want hentai, visual novels, farming simulators and leave the rest free to appear in your search so you can judge new things you didn't know about. You hate RTS? ok just filter it with negative tags and any game having RTS elements will be hidden, BUT you will still see any other genres so you can find new stuff.

See the difference? and its only gains, since if you like really focused stuff, you can also get there by filtering all you don't like. This usually happens with time, and if you (like me) save a bookmark with the pre-made searches, you can edit the tags you don't want and stack up a really personalized ""blacklist"" that YOU and not a random algorithm created. So negative filtering has only advantages and no downsides.


Hope this guy thinks these things better and takes the ""negative search"" approach because right now, the filtering system is useless.

It appears to me she is not completely over it, because she mentions him often, and she still has photos on social media with him. He cheated on her, so they broke up ( HE left her) and their relationship was really toxic. What bothers me a little bit is that he moved out her appartment, but he still lives in the same flat, and she told me that they text from time to time, send reels etc, and occasionally meet , when they want to borrow sth from each other etc. She told me that he had tried to invite her for a coffee or come to his place, but she had told no every time (after the breakup), but then she confessed she did not tell the exact truth and they slept with each other after this breakup before we met. I am 29 years old, but never had really too much experience with girls, so I dont want to move on so fast. I do realize this is an extreme red flag, and there is a high possibility that they will end together again in the future, but I even convinced myself that I am ok with it and just want to enjoy the present and dont expect serious relationship, although she told me she wanted to have serious relationship with me. But I do not simply trust her, so I told myself I would not expect anything serious from it and see where it moves. I specifically asked her a few times after we started dating if they had something together and she told me that they did not. 

As I stated before, I do realize that this behaviour is not ok, she keeps telling me that she is over him, but I can clearly see she is not. Lack of intimacy and experience in my life made me sort of tolerate this behaviour of hers and I am ashamed of myself for it. Is there any chance she would completely cut all contact with him, or shall I just move on, or enjoy it for now and plan for the worst?

It appears to me she is not completely over it, because she mentions him often, and she still has photos on social media with him. He cheated on her, so they broke up ( HE left her) and their relationship was really toxic. What bothers me a little bit is that he moved out her appartment, but he still lives in the same flat, and she told me that they text from time to time, send reels etc, and occasionally meet , when they want to borrow sth from each other etc. She told me that he had tried to invite her for a coffee or come to his place, but she had told no every time (after the breakup), but then she confessed she did not tell the exact truth and they slept with each other after this breakup before we met. I am 29 years old, but never had really too much experience with girls, so I dont want to move on so fast. I do realize this is an extreme red flag, and there is a high possibility that they will end together again in the future, but I even convinced myself that I am ok with it and just want to enjoy the present and dont expect serious relationship, although she told me she wanted to have serious relationship with me. But I do not simply trust her, so I told myself I would not expect anything serious from it and see where it moves. I specifically asked her a few times after we started dating if they had something together and she told me that they did not. 

As I stated before, I do realize that this behaviour is not ok, she keeps telling me that she is over him, but I can clearly see she is not. Lack of intimacy and experience in my life made me sort of tolerate this behaviour of hers and I am ashamed of myself for it. Is there any chance she would completely cut all contact with him, or shall I just move on, or enjoy it for now and plan for the worst?

Correct me if I am wrong, Jimmy told the malpractice insurance about Chuck's condition, which caused a domino effect ending in Chuck killing himself, Jimmy was very upset but when Howard came to visit and told them it was something about the insurance, Jimmy instantly flipped from sad to upbeat and positive went to make coffee and next went on job hunting.

Something isn't right he insulted the guys who gave him a job and then robbed them, Jimmy knew he killed his own brother his only family by accident and that's why he was acting weird, I have been eagerly waiting and waiting for that moment where crash and meltdown and acknowledge that he killed Chuck but it never happened, never.

And then when Jimmy and Kim where plotting and scheming to ruin Howard to get the sandpiper settlement I hated that , I didn't like Howard at first but later he turn out to be a good person he didn't deserve to be humiliated like that, the show gave me zero reason to root for Jimmy and Kim I was hope the plan would blowup on their face .

But I kinda get it, this how they explain why Kim and Jimmy aren't together anymore, Jimmy is a small and settle kind of schemes guy but Kim kept pushing for more and bigger schemes, they kept going until things went too far , that's where they realised they are bad for eachother.",3,1744210118.0,betterCallSaul,4,0.8,False

I‚Äôve always been a regular Starbucks customer, and over time I‚Äôve noticed something that really stuck with me‚Äîespecially as a parent. My daughter used to work at Starbucks, and at first, it felt like a great stepping stone. But not long after, I saw how completely burnt out she was. Some of her regular customers (who now boycott Starbucks)‚Äîpeople who genuinely loved coffee ‚Äîbasically pulled her aside and told her she¬†*had to get out of Starbucks*. It was heartbreaking. Management seemed to care more about sales and speed than about the people actually doing the work. She‚Äôs now with another company that values her, her salary has doubled with the same qualifications and experience and she‚Äôs planning to stay there long-term. 

From what I‚Äôve seen and read, the job has changed a lot. Promotions get dumped on baristas last-minute, some stores are severely understaffed, and the menu just keeps getting more bloated‚Äîleading to food waste and chaos behind the counter. One former employee even described it as turning from a quirky coffee shop into a ‚Äúsoulless fast food chain.‚Äù

So, I‚Äôd love to hear directly from you all:

**What do you think are the biggest pros and cons of working at Starbucks right now? What keeps you there‚Äîor what finally made you leave?**

Kardonk walks through the outskirts of Council territory. He needed some copper, but couldn‚Äôt find anyone offering any with the annealing he needed, and he really didnt want to do it himself.

He sighed. His heart wasnt in it anyway. He had just returned from two months in the Cretaceous to discover a massive hole in the side of his workshop. And he had to ndeavored to get materials to fix it, but to no avail.

He portaled back to the outskirts of Ithacar, choosing to walk through the neighboring hills and farms lands, before he turned back to the city. The purple trimmed hull of Ithacar‚Äôs first spelljammer, *The Flying Ithacarian*, loomed from behind a nearby hill. Kardonk normally wasnt much for aesthetics, but the shipment of purple hearted wood had made a simply gorgeous addition to the ships decorative features. 

Soon he arrived at his destination. A coffee shop. His favorite coffee shop. Manned by a local drow fellow. At first he didnt seem to trust Kardonk, his half elven features likely not working any favors, but over time they developed a rapport.

And by that, it is meant Kardonk put money int the counter, and the drow gave him coffee. Seeing as the drow still refused to speak to him, this was the extent of their business relationship.

Still, it was good coffee and worth the oddities. He takes it outside, and sits. Content to enjoy this luxury even for a moment.

## Understanding Your Outdoor Fire Pit Needs: Tailoring Your Choice

Before diving into specific models, it's crucial to understand your specific needs and priorities. The best outdoor fire pit for a residential backyard will differ greatly from one installed in a commercial restaurant setting. Let's break down the priorities for each target audience:

### 1. Homeowners & Landscapers: Balancing aesthetics, Durability, and Ease of Use

For homeowners and landscapers focusing on residential spaces, the primary objective is frequently enough to create an inviting and aesthetically pleasing outdoor living habitat. The right fire pit can transform a simple backyard into a focal point for gatherings. Here's what to consider:

*   **aesthetics and Design:** Outdoor fire pits come in various styles, from rustic wood-burning options to sleek, modern gas fire pit tables. Consider the existing patio design and landscaping to choose a fire pit that complements the overall aesthetic. Styles include modern concrete fire pits, classic copper fire pits, and durable steel fire pits.*   **Fuel Type:** Wood burning fire pits offer the customary appeal of crackling flames and authentic campfire aroma. Gas fire pits and propane fire pits provide convenience with instant ignition and adjustable flame height. Consider the ease of use, fuel availability, and local regulations when making your choice.
   **Portability:** If you envision moving the fire pit occasionally, a portable fire pit is essential. These models are typically lighter and easier to transport.
   **Size and Shape:** The size of the fire pit should be proportionate to the available space. Consider a smaller fire pit for intimate gatherings and a larger fire pit for accommodating larger groups. Shapes range from round and square to rectangular and linear, each offering a distinct visual appeal.

   **Visual Appeal:** Select fire features that complement the restaurant's aesthetic and create an inviting atmosphere. fire pit tables provide a functional surface for drinks and appetizers while adding a touch of elegance.

I have frequently read that it only matters to get the coffee sooner, but that it doesn't affect the flavor. 

I have made many, many tests with my 3 cup moka pot with the variables that I had: changing the grind size, changing the heat, changing the ratio, pre-heating or not... I got to a point where the coffee was generally good but sometimes it was a bit bitter and sometimes a bit sour. 

And I finally left all the variables the same but the pre-heating. And I found that with pre-heated water at boiling temperature (microwaved 2 mins), the coffee was a bit bitter, and without pre-heating the water, the coffee was a bit sour. So I tried with water microwaved for 1 min, which was just a bit warm, and it was absolutely great, not sour, not bitter. I have tried the same for several days and always the same: perfect!

My wife (30 MtF) and I (30M) have been together for 9 years now. We moved in together 3 weeks after we met figuring we'd either work it out or we wouldn't, and are now common law partners. We wear the rings, signed an affidavit, and call each other husband and wife but never had a wedding because we don't know anybody.

My wife was raised in the Philippines and moved to Canada at 18. I'm sure it's obvious that growing up trans in the Philippines would be less than great. She was physically and sexually abused from the age of 5 by those both inside and outside her family until she moved in with me at 21. Escaping her abusive family was a large part of why we moved her in with me so quickly.

I understood going in that she had a lot of trauma (not the extent) and some immature or unhealthy habits; they just always seemed like something we could work on as we go and if we broke up over any of them we'd at least have had a good time along the way.

My wife has made an incredible amount of progress in the time we've been together:  
\- Getting her reassignment surgery  
\- Upgrading highschool courses to get accepted into university  
\- Acing 2 years of biochemistry at university  
\- Excelling in and completing a respiratory therapy program in college and becoming a RT

I've been super happy to support her through all of this, as well as sharing some of my passions with her through teaching her about some of my hobbies.

Almost 2 years ago now she was diagnosed with DID and everything has gotten much more complicated.

She has never had a healthy way to deal with conflict, but with her DID it's now become clear that that is because it isn't \*her\* responding. It's one of a small army of angry child-versions of her furiously trying to defend her and keep her safe from things that do not pose a real threat to her.

9 years in she gets defensive over things that she should know better than to worry about from me and her version of defense is aggression, gaslighting, and eventually threatening self-harm and/or love-bombing and begging for forgiveness before I've had time to process anything.

I'm really struggling with feeling like a complete asshole for holding her accountable for the things that aren't really her, but I'm also having a hard time figuring out where the line in the sand should be drawn that enough is enough and I need to leave. If I don't figure out where the line into too much is, I worry that I'm not respecting myself enough to insist on being treated reasonably.

All of this has become extra clear to me because of my relationship with my best friend (F28). My best friend and I met playing a D&D game online, where we'd started talking after sessions; she'd tell me what was going on with her life and eventually I started noticing patterns in her husband's behavior that didn't seem healthy. We started a spreadsheet of all the shit he did, and eventually despite her traumatic upbringing she saw past the facade and recognized that her husband was physically, sexually, and financially abusing her. She's now in the process of leaving her husband, which is great; Less great is that I've gotten really good about picking out narcissistic patterns of behavior and haven't been happy with my wife's treatment of me for some time.

A few weeks ago, my friend came to visit for some time to breathe before actually leaving her husband. She lives over a 15 hour drive and across an international border away. She also has two young daughters and is decidedly not my type; which my wife knows. Despite all this, my wife gets insecure about her just because she's a cis-gendered woman. She keeps trying to convince herself that I'm lying about being child-free and would be happier with my friend because she can (and does already) have kids.

During this trip there was one particularly active day where we all went out. My friend and wife went out for coffee together; we all got breakfast; we all got tattoos; and we went around a couple local tourist-y places downtown. My wife and I don't get downtown very often and she was understandably excited, but my friend has hip issues and I'd just gotten a significant tattoo on my calf that was bleeding a lot and causing me a lot of pain. Eventually we decided to go back to the car but my wife was bouncing around getting entirely too dramatic and excited over things that just weren't that exciting. I told her I'd appreciate her toning it down a bit because I couldn't keep up while in pain and she threw a tantrum accusing us of excluding her all day and gave me the silent treatment for the 40 minute drive home. She eventually admitted that she hadn't felt excluded during any of our activities and that one of her alters had attacked me because she felt judged.

Later in the week my wife threw a fit over the fact that my friends elbow might have touched mine while all three of us shared a couch to watch a movie. This eventually led to her throwing her head into a wall and trying to overdose on a bunch of pills. Luckily, the 8-year-old alter doesn't know which of her pills are actually harmful and she did not take any pills that would cause her harm in a meaningful dosage, but self-harm is my only real trigger and she knows it.

There was another instance of her getting upset about something I'd said about a dress (after she'd explicitly asked about the dress) where she inferred something that wasn't said, thanked me for clarifying, then still gave me the silent treatment for 40 minutes on our way to a movie and told me that she understood that I hadn't said anything hurtful but that I was still wrong because she'd been upset.

I'm at the point where it's hard for me to talk to her because she gets upset over things that I haven't even said and accuses me of things that I haven't done. It's incredibly difficult for me to develop any feelings of intimacy because I can't share anything with her because every conversation is another opportunity for her to latch onto something that she almost willfully misunderstands so that she can play the victim.

I do still love her. The regular and conscious version of my wife is my favorite person, but I'm not living with \*just\* that version. I'm living with her moment-to-moment actions.

Her therapist suggests that I need to get to know her alters and ask them by name to send her back out when they come out, but I have ADHD and have an extremely strong justice sensitivity. It's hard for me to stop and consider what's going on when she's actively attacking me; I get defensive instead.

Her therapist also recommends couples counseling, but specifies that we need to get a therapist who is familiar with DID because ""otherwise, they'll just accuse (wife) of abuse"", as if her behavior isn't abusive.

I'm struggling because I am not as susceptible to this kind of abuse as others. My best friend was raised mormon by an abusive family and her sense of self is almost non-existent. She is impacted \*so heavily\* by everything anyone says or does to her and I'm just not. I've gotten through 9\~ years of this just fine, generally happy, even; but now that I'm seeing the patterns it's a lot harder to accept things day-by-day.

I'm not good with emotional decisions and I'm having a really hard time turning drawing my line in the sand into a rational one that I'll be able to feel good about.

I tried going to therapy (which I can't afford to do long-term because I'm currently between jobs) and when I asked ""How long am I supposed to put up with this?

About me: I'm 23 and I go to school for forensics. I like to play games (board games, video games, dnd, etc.), watch horror movies, go thrifting (I'm really into fashion/style), try new coffee/tea places, write, skate and take hikes/walks. 

I'm 6'1, skinny, tan skin, curly brown hair to my shoulders, brown eyes, and I usually dress more alternative/goth/dark.

I'd say for my personality, I'm very down-to-earth but also full of energy/socialness, curious/adventurous, open-minded, creative, and just generally easy-going and fun-loving. My love language is quality time, and my personality type is ENFP.

Hello fellow Nintendo fans! I‚Äôm Argentinian, for those who don‚Äôt know, my country has been in an economic crisis since I was born. Earning money is objectively difficult down here, and prices are beyond this world. Nowadays a coffee is 4 US dollars, imagine the rest. Two years ago, the same coffee was 0.50 USD.

I don‚Äôt get why Americans are so stressed out about Nintendo raising it‚Äôs prices. Last time I went to the US everything was considerably more expensive. Inflation is real.  The federal reserve took ages to raise interest rates, and since the pandemic, it‚Äôs been money printing non-stop.

Why‚Äôd Nintendo not raise it‚Äôs prices?

I‚Äôm looking forward to read you and understand better this situation.

We have always gotten along but the friendship has started to become a burden rather than enjoyable and I believe one of the reasons is one friend,  let‚Äôs call her Lara (39f). I do have very close relationships individually with some folks in this group, one of them being one of my best friends. 

Ever since we can remember Lara has been stingy. She is the type that when you tell her coffee is on you she will order the most expensive item in the menu. When we have potlucks she always brings the cheapest things and when she hosts she always makes the tiniest portions where we are always left hungry. The kicker is when she has people over she will literally split down to the pennies and will even make comments like ‚ÄúI saw you did not eat as much so you can give me x amounts.‚Äù SHE WATCHES us eat and how much??? I mean this is crazy.

In the past I have tried talking to her, it got better for a while and now she‚Äôs back to her old self. This also extends to gifts, we always do extensive gifts for birthdays etc and she will come with literally the cheapest earrings she has left over. She never bothers to know what we like and our style. This also affects the way she takes over conversations and makes no space for anyone else. Now, i understand that this might be cultural, I come from a very different cultural background where we would never charge people that come over for dinner it‚Äôs unthinkable but I feel this is too much. The funny thing is she might be the one that is better off financially out of all of us. 

Now, I am emotionally exhausted by her. So AITAH if I begin to slowly cut her out of my life?

Can't seem to tell me where it is and b. Keeps waffling between an ezcema and psoriasis diagnosis. But I'm so fucking itchy that I am avoiding showering because the hot water stings, and then I get out and start shivering, which also doesn't help. Is there anything that has helped you deal with the temperature fluctuations? My mental health is in the toilet for a few reasons, but feeling very physically bad is almost certainly a large part. And then realizing how badly you smell and wearing really ratty soft pajamas to not make touching your skin hurt hasn't helped either. 

Things I have tried in addition: Clobetasol, both in cream for the body and in alcohol for the scalp. Hydrocortisone...the OTC doesn't work but a cream is so much nicer than that fucking ointment I just got. Aquaphor spray. Vaseline. Really expensive colloidal oatmeal creams. Really cheap Aveeno ones. MMJ(if we are trying to fight inflammatory conditions, why not?). Exercise and taking my brain pills. I feel both better and worse when I go to the gym (sweating). Drinking so much water I've thrown up...if we have to hydrate to fight this condition, idk. Ezcema body wash for babies. Dr. Bronner's. Vick's vapo rub.  Epsom salt baths. (Sitting in human soup gives me the ick) I'm willing to adjust my diet, but I did the Whole 30 once and didn't notice that anything positively or negatively affected me. Zepbound...not for the skin, but anti-inflammatory.  I don't want to dump oatmeal in the bath because I don't want a chance of a drain clog, and see above about human soup. I already use sensitive skin detergent for my clothes and stopped using fabric softener. I basically quit coffee and switched to a high caffeine tea. Trying to limit diet soda and trying to watch the booze consumption...also unhelpful, but I'm so miserable I just want to knock myself the fuck out. Back scratchers but I live alone and so maybe putting cream on my back would be helpful but I can't. 

I took a personal day because I triggered my acid reflux trying to boost brain health (my two favorite things are tomatoes and spicy food, they don't appear to be loving me back any longer, and Spicy V8 coming back up has not made it easy for me to keep anything down).
