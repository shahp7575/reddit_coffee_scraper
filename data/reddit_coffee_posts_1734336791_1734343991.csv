1hffz5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hffz5w/moving_coffee_machine_from_eu_to_au/,Moving coffee machine from EU to AU,"Hi everyone,

After almost 10 years abroad I'm moving from the NL back to (sometimes) sunny Melbourne.

I have a very loved Sage Oracle Touch that I'm pretty happy with. We're planning to ship everything back home via sea, and I'm wondering if it's wise to send our coffee machine back as well.

My main concern is whether we'll get grief from biosecurity. I'm pretty sure I can clean it very throughly, but I don't know how strict they are on this. Alternatively, I could just sell the machine locally and look at getting a new machine in Australia but this seems like a bit of a waste. 

Does anyone have any thoughts / wisdom / experience?",1,1734343752.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1hffyvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/eComEnclave/comments/1hffyvy/5step_process_for_finding_lowcompetition_amazon/,5-Step Process for Finding Low-Competition Amazon Winners,"Our formula works for one reason...

We don't ""guess"" if a product will sell.

1. We find a product that already sells
2. We Improve the product by 10%
3. We sell it under our own brand

We've used the same formula to launch 9 different products that are all profitable.

# Step 1 - Find Winning Products

[JungleScout Opportunity Score](https://preview.redd.it/4zbhm7w9o67e1.jpg?width=1304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2230c87f5eb9fcaf93ddb57408b8b5300d467107)

I use [JungleScout](https://honeysyed.com/junglescout) to find products with:

* → 600+ monthly sales 
* → 1000+ monthly searches 
* → Under 2000 reviews

This shows me products already selling on Amazon but with low competition.

# Step 2 - Create a Variation

[1 Star Review](https://preview.redd.it/e55eh2kdo67e1.jpg?width=920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08d17ac78aaaac9ded3535137af3014fab17ee67)

Next I find the product on Amazon.

* → I find the current top sellers 
* → I look at their ""1-star"" reviews

I look for the number 1 main issue that customers have with the product.

# Step 3- Design your own brand

[Grank Genick](https://preview.redd.it/na17d4jfo67e1.jpg?width=1304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c7d09ee10f9bd53c97848884b7b9037ee07de54b)

For your name & logo, use namelix.

Then go to midjourney and use AI to create some high-quality mockups.

Save these for your manufacturer and they will create custom packaging.

# Step 4 - Find a manufacturer

[Alibaba Verified Supplier](https://preview.redd.it/2wwqataho67e1.jpg?width=2410&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47994585a884c419f424852acdd2453ab6d7d375)

For this, I use Alibaba.

* → Search for your product 
* → Sort by ""verified sellers"" 
* → Send them the changes you want 
* → Order a sample product

If the sample comes out how you want it, then order 100 units to Amazon.

# Step 5 - Boost your Listing

[Helium10 Dashboard](https://preview.redd.it/394mmkilo67e1.jpg?width=1304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28d81803aacfcacb80f9a7fb720df147d9d90160)

You can do this with Amazon ads:

* → Find your product on [https://Helium10.com](https://honeysyed.com/helium10) 
* → Look at the top 10 keywords 
* → Target these with your ads

This is how we get our listings at the top of the search and start to drive sales.

This is all it takes to launch on Amazon!

1. Find a winning product
2. Find a supplier who makes it
3. Improve the product by 10%
4. Add your own unique branding
5. Boost it with Amazon ads

One product changed our lives!

Put in the work and you can do the same.

Unless I'm in my dorm, in which I...still do that lol (the toilet flush is crazzzzzy loud!).

But yeah, isn't it strange how, I guess it genuinely doesn't get to them? People sit on the bus with no headphones, walk down busy, crowded noisy streets; big rumble-loud busses and pointy-loud bikes zooming past. Or even cooking and cleaning, the idea that the noise buffer = a physical buffer too (to clean, I need the 'space' of cleanliness that my headphones gives me - hearing scrubbing and putting things away feels dirty).

Anything like that really. I went to a coffee shop recently with my siblings, and it was madness. Maybe it's more sensitive now that I have the privilege of protecting my sensory needs 24/7 almost, but it felt like utter torture. Weird.

I'm also curious about if its more of a 'well, I was born into it, and it's not that bad but I don't like it' NT pov for sensory things, or genuinely a 'what noise? Oh the cars? Yeah, they're cars so, that's what they do. I never had an issue with the 'rumble' of the bus ahah'.  I wonder",1,1734343625.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False

Somewhere in the middle of December, we'd spent a weekend baking cookies. We're pretty famous among our friends and coworkers for our decorated sugar cookies. We make dozens upon dozens of different varieties. My wife will take some to work, w6ell take some to church for coffee hour. We'll give gift boxes to the neighbors. In fact the thing I miss most now that I work from home is that I can't take cookies in for my coworkers.*”

I’m looking to meet some like-minded people in Mumbai to hang out, explore the city, and maybe discover some hidden gems together. Whether it’s grabbing a coffee, trying out a new restaurant, or just having a good conversation, I’m up for it.

A bit about me:

 I am a total foodie and love trying out new places to eat. Living in Mumbai, there always is a new spot opening every two months and so much variety of cuisines that it keeps appeasing my tastebuds. Last I enjoyed was Creme Brulee at Pauls Cafe. Damn! It was delicious! 

I watch more of TV series. Over the years, I have gravitated from movies to TV series. My fav TV series are Black Mirror, Rick and Morty and Westworld (Uptill Season 2)

I also love books. I read both fiction and nonfiction. I recently read Short Stay in Hell, Jar of Hearts, and Convenience Store Woman. 

I’m easygoing and love playful conversations. I am a lil delulu as well. Plus points if you are a certified delulu like me. 

Open to meeting anyone who’s friendly and just wants to chill or do something fun in this bustling city. Let’s connect and plan something cool!

-----_-----------_------------_---------_----------_----------_-----------_--
I have tried meeting from apps before and this is what my experience was -
- Men are looking for hookups or fwbs or dates
- Then there are creeps, perverts and too clingy folks. These are a no-no.
- Woman don't wanna connect and talk. I don't know why. Maybe if someone gave me some feedback, I would have a better idea. 

All my friends have shifted cities or countries and I guess the loneliness is getting to me these days. This post is only to socialize and make friends.

DM me if you’re interested. Please be 25+. Looking forward to meeting some awesome people!

Note - (1) I would like to talk to someone for about a month before we meet. The chats don't have to be continuous or days on ends...just chatting twice a week suffices. 

(2) I am here only for SFW stuff. Also, I m in a committed relationship. Reiterating, please DM me only if you are looking to make friends.

I have three teens. Narc spouse is being such a jerk. First he threw a massive fit because he was hot-it was 19 C in the room. The rest of us were fine. He wanted the window open-it was below freezing as we are in the Alps. When I said the rest of us are fine and will be cold he throws a massive fit. He then proceeds to stay up until 3 am, and is sitting up with his phone on listening to a book, therefore keeping me awake. Then tries to tell our youngest she doesn’t want to go sightseeing and they should stay home because she has a cough(my parents are here as well and have a 5 seater car). She says no she wants to go. He then is a jerk the rest of the day. Then this morning he goes to fill up the coffee pot and we don’t ever use non filtered water at home. I say just fill it up at the tap and he proceeds to tell me that is gross. He says he will use HIS WATER BOTTLE that had filtered water in it. I say you drank out of that. He says who cares-mind you he’s a total germaphobe and would lose his mind if someone else did this. I said if anyone else did that you’d be upset. He starts telling me that I’m once again being dramatic. Now our daughter bought herself a treat and always offers to share and she walks in and before she can get a word in he starts attacking her telling her how selfish she is. She goes on the defensive rightfully so. And he says I can’t even have a conversation with my DD. I said well you attacked her right from the get go and she has shared every time. She said dad I offered you some the other day and he immediately shamed her for eating a pastry. The issue I’m having too is he has cancer. And is having a massive surgery in less than a month to remove it. And he has ruined every last memory he’s had with them. This was just a snippet of my hellish vacation. My kids and I tend to travel alone and we all said we want to do this from now on. I’m so over it all. I feel like I’m crazy 99.9% of the time. I know I’m not just incredibly hard.

1hffnj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicAttack/comments/1hffnj8/is_this_a_panic_attack/,Is this a panic attack?,"Does anyone else randomly wake up at night with insomnia and paranoia?

This happens once in a few months. It doesn't depend on how I felt before sleep(even really happy) or what kind of dream I had. Most of the time it happens when it's REALLY quiet in the room and nighttime.

Usually it starts with silence feeling way too intrusive and uncanny, ringing in my ears. I just feel so isolated, there's a dark feeling of impending doom, like something is about to kill me in my room any moment, tension, pressure, hopelessness. Every detail and sensation feels so intrusive and overwhelming, a sense of urgency. I have this horrible mix of feeling really exhausted and wanting to go to sleep but also being too hyper to fall asleep, I have some extra pent-up energy I need to release, my limbs feel irritated as if they're trapped in a tight space when they're not which leads me to removing the blanket or shaking my legs. I feel very hypersensitive and numb at the same time, have a high temperature, my mouth feels very dry, I'm really thirsty. If the light is off, my mind starts making up scary silluettes - if the light is on, every dark spot in my room and every glowing dot and every eye on a toy, poster or painting feels oddly threatening. Everything feels like a dream and unreal, but also too real at the same time, feeling out of my body, my vision gets very sharp like I'm watching my life at 8k. My feet feel like they're burning. There's drought and light physical pain everywhere on my skin. Everything in my peripheral begs me to turn around, my heart is racing. I can't calm down or convince nyself in anything, it's just so powerful, I crumble under this irrational fear. I feel like I MUST NOT think anything hopeful or else I'm underestimating some kind of imaginary demons that are gonna come after me then, as if they will come after me exactly now as if I'm special, I often wrap myself up in a blanket, meticulously making sure every corner is closed, so that nothing dangerous can crawl into the gap, like I'm in debt to these hypothetical creatures, not a single wrong move or thought or else, just waves of fear. At some point it gets hard to breathe and feels too tight, so I crawl out of the blanket, but then I get scared and hide again, just this intese paranoia+panic torture all night, with bursts of sudden jumpscare type fear. There are many cases where I also cry and hyperventilate, just can't control my breath, stutter and stuff. It feels like it'll never end.

This whole thing lasts for hours and then I either somehow fall asleep or stay awake 'till the morning and then it all goes away and sometimes I even feel euphoric after it ends.

I tried to think of what causes it. Is it too silent or too hot or not enough air or is it the full moon or due to drinking too much black/green tea - all things that often co-occur with this, but there are so many times when they don't and it still happens. I don't drink coffee or alcohol, and this definetely has nothing to do with any pills since it started early in my childhood. Trauma maybe? Idk.

Drinking some tea or milk, listening to music, eating or watching a video or to tell myself that it's just the same room as it is at day and not any more dangerous sometimes kinda helps.

I don't want any advice, I just want to know if anyone goes through this specific thing and how to call it. Like what is this? It's not quite a panic attack, because it lasts for hours, while the official definition of a panic attack says it lasts half an hour at most.",1,1734342308.0,PanicAttack,1,1.0,False

My second son just turned 12 weeks old. I'm blessed to get 14 weeks of leave and my husband gets 8. However, my husband didn't start his leave until just 2 weeks ago. He had important things going on at work, but I'm at a much easier point now and could have really used his help at more of the 4 week mark when I was on my own with both boys.  And not only that but it just made me feel like work was more important than us. 
Now that he has started leave it's turner into vacation for him it feels like.  He has golfed and gone to the gym nearly every day. The only part that's helpful is that I get to sleep for a couple hours in the morning and he takes the boys.  But that is literally the easiest time. The baby is also and the toddler plays nicely by himself in the morning. So he reads a book and drinks coffee. After that it's all me again. I do everything at night. Up until his family came to visit he's been in a separate room at night. Which is fine because he is such a bear if he doesn't get sleep. Im just so annoyed. I don't know how to talk to him about it anymore because he is anyways like you just need to ask for help.  But when I do ask..  it's only 50/50 that it actually happens.  I just want to walk away sometimes.  
It's 2am and the baby won't stay awake long enough to eat but won't let me set him down to sleep either and I'm just so frustrated. My husband is getting up to go fishing in the morning so i won't get the chance to sleep and I'm so over it. Please tell me I'm not crazy for being annoyed. ",1,1734342169.0,Mommit,0,1.0,False

Using shivs, I've beaten A20 a number of times and A20H twice (when I get 2x after image + kunai), but I don't think I've even won a non-heart A20 game using discard or poison.

Sometimes I enter act 2 with a really decent discard deck (calculated gamble+, eviscerate, sneaky strike) or a poison deck if boss is guardian/hexaghost (flask+ and catalyst), but I usually bleed hp in the act2 hallway fights due to lack of upfront damage, making the elite fights hard.

Conversely, if I do a shiv run, I can usually do 2-3 elites in act 2-3, especially if I got coffee dripper or cursed key as an act 1 reward. But I have to pray I get 2x after image + kunai/fan/wraith form before act 4 or else I can't kill heart.

When I sanded my Contigo coffee mug to steel, after it had chipped prominently, I assumed it can go in the dishwasher. But, now I have ruined the vacuum and the bottle does not keep hot for any length of time. Another vacuum I have, a water bottle, has also been washed in dishwasher, for years now, and still keeps my water cold for many hours.

I have also dropped both of them to concrete multiple times. Yes, i'm clumsy that way.

So what's the catch here?

There seems to be a few technologies or approaches to making them insulated. It seems one way is where some sort of beads are keeping the vaccuum. In which case, if dishwasher is used on higher temps, the metal expands/contracts, and vacuum gets broken.

But, some brands DO say they are dishwasher safe. Are they using a different method?

Also, regarding color.. And this is one of the most common question people have, ""will it chip"", ""does the paint hold up"". I get the aesthetical reason. Buyers want certain colors.

But why not choose the third, superior option—completely unhinge their sense of reality? Here’s how to not just survive but leave a lasting impact, ensuring the criminal spends the rest of their life wondering what just happened.

---

1. Convince Them They’ve Already Mugged You

Before they even get a word out, frantically dig through your pockets and shout, “I just gave you all my money! Wasn’t that enough?!” Hold out an empty coffee cup or lint ball as proof. Bonus points if you start crying about how you can’t keep being their victim every Tuesday. No criminal wants to look greedy.

---

2. Summon Your Imaginary Henchmen

Look over their shoulder and say, “Oh, you’re gonna regret this. Barry, release the badgers!” Then act disappointed when no badgers appear, muttering, “They never show up on time.” Criminals hate it when their victim has backup—especially if it’s feral wildlife.

---

3. Speak Only in Ancient Prophecies

Switch to a foreboding tone and whisper: “So, the Chosen One has come to steal the wallet of destiny. Do you not fear the curse of the Leather Pouch?” If they hesitate, follow up with: “Legend says whoever robs me will lose their car keys forever. Forever.” Criminals can’t operate without transportation, so this one hits hard.

---

4. Pretend You’re in Training for a More Dangerous Job

When they threaten you, laugh maniacally and shout, “YES! Finally, my mock-mugging training begins!” Then start critiquing their technique: “Your stance is all wrong. If you were really serious, you’d be holding the knife like this.” The idea that you’re using them as practice will completely throw them off their game.

---

5. Offer a Trade They Can’t Refuse

When they demand your wallet, hold up something ridiculous like a pinecone or a single shoe and whisper, “You don’t want my money. You want this.” Then add, “It’s the only thing that keeps the portal closed.” They might not believe you, but they won’t want to risk being wrong.

---

6. Invent a Long-Lost Connection

Gasp dramatically and shout, “Wait, aren’t you Cousin Terry’s kid? Wow, you’ve grown! He told me you’d get into trouble one day.” Hug them awkwardly while whispering, “I won’t tell Aunt Carol if you just walk away now.” Criminals hate being roped into fictional family reunions.

---

7. Start Speaking in a Completely Made-Up Language

When confronted, look terrified and blurt out a stream of nonsense like, “Glorp zagnog! Flibber tock donka FLEEP!” Then gasp and clutch your head as if you’ve accidentally triggered something terrible. If they look confused, shout, “Oh no! The prophecy is real!” and run. Even hardened criminals can’t handle interdimensional gibberish.

---

8. Pretend They’re on a Hidden Camera Show—But You’re the Host

Point at them dramatically and yell, “We got him, folks! He really thought he could rob someone in broad daylight!” Act like a camera crew is closing in, high-fiving an imaginary boom operator. Start interviewing the criminal: “So, what’s it like being caught on Gotcha, Muggers!?!” Few criminals are prepared for the humiliation of fake TV stardom.

---

9. Stage an Exorcism—On Them

Pull out an imaginary crucifix (or a breadstick if available) and shout, “The power of common decency compels you!” Then sprinkle invisible holy water and scream, “OUT, foul spirit of thievery!” By the time you’re writhing on the ground chanting, “Begone, Wallet Demon!” they’ll be long gone.

---

10. Turn the Tables and Mug Them Instead

Flip the script. Interrupt their threat with, “Give me your wallet!” Look them dead in the eye and add, “Unless you’ve got two wallets, this feels like a fair trade.” Criminals aren’t prepared for counter-muggings and might even hand you their phone out of sheer panic.

---

11. Claim You’re Training for an Action Movie

Pull out your phone and pretend to film them, shouting, “And... action! Okay, try threatening me again, but with more emotion. Remember, you’re robbing me because your dreams of becoming a chef never worked out. Dig into that pain!” Give them acting tips until they forget they’re not auditioning for something.

---

12. Introduce Them to Your “Dangerous Alter Ego”

Suddenly change your posture, drop your voice an octave, and mutter, “You shouldn’t have done that. Now you’ve woken up The Lizard.” Start hissing and darting your tongue like a reptile. Nothing derails a mugging like the fear that their victim is possibly venomous.

---

13. Fake a Government Experiment

Hold up a random object, like a pen, and shout, “DO NOT MOVE! This anti-mugging prototype is still experimental!” Start beeping and making explosion noises while waving the pen around. Then mutter, “Last time it vaporized someone. Shame about Bob.” Criminals don’t like being vaporized, even hypothetically.

---

14. Leave Them a Heartfelt Yelp Review

Before they leave, say, “I rate this mugging a 3/10. Your approach lacked finesse, and you didn’t even wear a ski mask. Do better next time!” Then hand them an imaginary comment card with tips like, “Be more intimidating” or “Consider using a catchphrase.” No one wants to be a poorly-reviewed criminal.

---

15. End With a Life-Affirming Lesson

After you’ve thoroughly baffled them, stare deeply into their eyes and whisper, “You don’t have to do this. There’s still time to turn your life around. Have you considered pottery? Or birdwatching? Birds never rob anyone.” Hand them a fake business card for a birdwatching club and walk away. Criminals love being given options, especially ones that involve warblers.

---

Final Thoughts: Leave Them Wondering Forever

By the time you’re done, the criminal won’t just leave empty-handed—they’ll leave questioning their entire existence. They’ll sit in a dark room for weeks, clutching their cursed wallet, wondering if they’re actually related to you or why no badgers ever showed up. Congratulations. You’ve not only survived but potentially created an ex-criminal who now spends their days baking sourdough bread and talking to pigeons.",2,1734341369.0,PhilomenaCunk,0,1.0,False

Just a bit hah

_Basic info about me:_

31M (but questioning gender)

long-term volunteer

been describes as chill, patient, calm

am a bit introverted but can open up quite fast

vegan for 11+years, don't drink alcohol, don't like weed,, however am a bit addicted to coffee/caffeine

politically aware/active, 
respect and wellbeing for all!

i like nature (uhh, how much more generic and vague can this get?), swimming in natural bodies of water in any season, and sauna.
i am interested in quite a broad range of topics, also depends on my current hyperfixation.

_Basic info about the trip (pretty flexible, my pass is for 2 months and I gotta use it in the following 11):_

I would like to go all the way South - Spain and Portugal(as far as possible with trains) as well as all the way North - Scandinavia. 
It is possible to ""tag along"" for just a part of the trip. For a week or two.  Indeed 2 months together can be a bit daunting commitment to make.
I would like to find some sort of a volunteering stay/workaway or two.

Ideally I would start the trip in August, but I am open to an earlier or later start, with good company.

Staying overnight would be as low cost as possible - night trains, hostels and/or campsites (TBD). Or even couchsurfing and its numerous alternatives.


_A little bit about you:_
Ideally vegan OR enthusiastic about trying out vegan dishes in various venues along the way, of course I still wanna keep it lowcost, but this is one of my joys while travelling.
If not vegan, willing to refrain from using/consuming animals while travelling with me.

Enjoying a beer here and there (not every day) or being an occassional smoker is not an issue for me, neither is weed, but in that regard I would only ask to keep the (weed) smoke far away from me. 

Gender doesn't matter.

We can chat a bit and see if we vibe, also learn some more about eachother and perhaps schedule a videocall. If you're in the NL in the next few months, we can also meet in person.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become one of the most sought-after cosmetic treatments today. Many individuals yearn for that perfect, dazzling smile, and the effects can be quite transformative. The promise of a brighter, whiter smile draws countless people into dental offices and beauty salons. Let’s explore the before and after experiences of teeth whitening, shedding light on the differences it can make in your appearance and confidence.

### Understanding the Process of Teeth Whitening

Before diving into the results, it's important to understand how teeth whitening works. Generally, the process involves using bleaching agents to lighten the color of your teeth. There are a few common methods:

- **In-Office Treatments:** These are conducted by dental professionals and typically yield immediate results.
- **At-Home Kits:** These come with custom trays or strips for you to use in the comfort of your own home, usually taking longer to show results.
- **Natural Remedies:** Some people opt for baking soda or hydrogen peroxide, though results may be less predictable.

### The Before Experience

Before embarking on your teeth whitening journey, it’s common to feel a mix of anticipation and apprehension. Many people feel self-conscious about discolored teeth due to various factors, including:

Comparing Professional vs. At-Home Teeth Whitening: Results and Insights
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to achieving a bright, confident smile, the choices for teeth whitening can feel overwhelming. Many people wonder about the differences between professional whitening treatments and at-home kits. Understanding these options can help you make the right choice for your dental health and personal needs.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### What Is Professional Teeth Whitening?

Professional teeth whitening is done in a dental office by a trained dentist. This method often uses stronger bleaching agents compared to at-home products. The procedure usually takes about one hour and provides immediate results that can lighten teeth by several shades.

### Benefits of Professional Whitening

- **Fast Results:** You can see dramatic changes in just one visit.
- **Custom Treatment:** Dentists tailor the treatment for your specific needs.
- **Safety:** Professionals ensure that the procedure is safe and effective, minimizing risks of damage.
- **Enhanced Knowledge:** Dentists provide guidance on post-treatment care and oral hygiene.

### How Does At-Home Teeth Whitening Work?

At-home teeth whitening usually includes whitening strips, gels, or trays with lower concentrations of bleaching agents. These products can be purchased over the counter and require a longer commitment, often taking a few days to a few weeks to see substantial changes.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Benefits of At-Home Whitening

- **Convenience:** You can whiten your teeth at your own pace, fitting it into your schedule.
- **Cost-Efficient:** At-home kits are generally less expensive than professional treatments.
- **Variety:** There are numerous products available, allowing you to choose based on your preferences.

### Comparing Results: Professional vs. At-Home

Many factors play into the outcome of teeth whitening, including the type of product, the initial shade of your teeth, and how diligently you follow the instructions. Here’s a closer look at what you can typically expect from both methods:

#### Professional Teeth Whitening Results

With professional teeth whitening, patients often achieve results that last longer, up to several years, depending on their diet and care. The teeth can brighten up to 8 shades within a single session. This immediate transformation is often a key reason individuals choose professional whitening.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
#### At-Home Whitening Results

At-home kits usually produce results that are less dramatic compared to professional treatments. Most at-home products may lighten teeth by 2 to 4 shades over several treatments. While this option is convenient, it requires patience and commitment for noticeable results.

### Potential Side Effects

Both professional and at-home whitening treatments can cause temporary sensitivity. However, the risk of damage to enamel or gums may be higher with at-home products if not used correctly. It’s vital to always follow the instructions provided and consult a dentist if you have concerns.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Long-Term Effectiveness and Maintenance

After receiving whitening treatments, maintaining your bright smile is crucial. Here are some tips:

- **Brush Regularly:** Maintain a good oral hygiene routine with fluoride toothpaste.
- **Avoid Staining Foods:** Limit coffee, tea, red wine, and other staining foods.
- **Regular Dental Check-ups:** Consistent dental visits help maintain your oral health and brightness.

### Which Option Is Right for You?

Your choice between professional and at-home teeth whitening should depend on your lifestyle, budget, and desired results. If you need quick results and personalized care, professional whitening may be best. If you prefer a more gradual approach and lower costs, at-home treatments can be effective as well. Ultimately, the key is to ensure that your choice fits your unique needs and goals.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
No matter which method you choose, a brighter smile can significantly impact your confidence and enhance your overall appearance. Always remember to prioritize your dental health and consult with a professional before starting any whitening regimen. Happy whitening!

### Conclusion

Experiencing the transformative effects of teeth whitening can be truly remarkable, as many individuals vividly illustrate through their before and after experiences. Those who have undergone this treatment often share stories of boosted self-esteem, increased confidence, and a brighter smile that enhances their overall appearance. The noticeable change in the color of their teeth not only alters how they perceive themselves but also how others view them, leading to more positive social interactions.

When it comes to the choice between professional and at-home teeth whitening methods, insights reveal distinct benefits and results for each. Professional treatments, conducted by dentists, typically offer quicker and more dramatic results, often using stronger whitening agents than those found in at-home kits. While the cost is a factor to consider, the efficacy can outweigh the price for many seeking immediate, transformative outcomes. Conversely, at-home teeth whitening options provide convenience and affordability, letting you achieve a whiter smile over time with consistent use. Although the results may be less pronounced initially, patience can pay off, allowing for gradual color improvement.

1hffdzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hffdzi/break_up_and_shared_assets_problem/,Break up and shared assets problem ,"Hi guys. My ex and I split up beginning of October. He split up with me - although at 1st hurt and sad, after some space from them  and how things being recently I see it as a good thing now. I want to focus on myself and move forward and close this chapter in my life. After the move and settling in I am going to ask him to not to talk for couple of months to just let the emotions go down and see if we would got on as friends and build from there if possible.

Context: mid 30s, almost 3 years together, co-own furnishing. we have 2 dogs.  He borrowed from me £8k couple of years ago and still owes me £6k. We bough 55"" £1089 Tv, £600 washing machine, £700 dyson vacuum cleaner that is in bad condition but still working, sofa worth £2k. We upscaled furniture. Restoring them involved sanding it and beeswaxing (by my ex). while he is very good at DIY I am also great and finding gems for free so in my mind we equally own them. Plus we bought other stuff- most things we have we co-own.

We're splitting the dogs. I take older and already trained and stable dog - my ex put a lot of work into it and tought me a lot in the process of it. And he is taking younger and more difficult dog that I cannot handle safely outside - he has skills to manage the dog and potential to train them up. Nonetheless, we both are more emotionally attached to the older dog as it's been with us longer and less difficult than the other. Obviously this is unquantifiable exchange but he could have rehomed the other one (I suggested it when we were still together but he was adamant he wanted to try to train up the dog and still wants to keep the younger one). If he rehomed the younger dog the older dog might have gone with my ex as I think he will be a better owner provided he was the only dog and he has more time for him. And I would like what is best for he dog. The older dog is also reactive as he is a rescue and I might need his help in the 1st year to make sure I handle him safely outside and advice. I did mentioned that if the other dog mellows down with age as the older biy did and the problematic areas are resolved we could swap the dogs back (but tbh not sure if I manage to give the boy back - I bonded even more with him while my ex has been away). Although I feel confident as I learnt a lot and we had trainers. So I should really try to keep things amicable and try to come to solution re the furniture in case there is a problem and I might need his help with the dog in future as much as I'd love to not be in contact with my ex really. I must say his communication is not the greatest and it is frustrating at times.

Due to, let's call it, misunderstanding. My ex thought he'll keep the sofa and the TV - original value over £3k. Got upset about me listing it for the sale. I got offer of £700 for the TV but it seems to be scam. Someone came to see the sofa that I listed down to £600. It seems his place is unfurnished and maybe bigger to what I found.

Because he owns me a lot of money, I didn't consider he would buy me out from sofa and TV, hence listing it to sell it. I was planning to split it a half and give him his half - but he feels I leave him with nothing and not keeping to my word of him wanting to be okay. In my mind dividing expensive shared assets and being okay are 2 different things. I bought an expensive training equipment for one of our dogs that I paid. We have agreement of dogs sitting when one goes away, but he has been already away for 3 weeks and I have been taking care of both dogs before he gone away and after as he has not been staying much in the flat, so since early October really. My feeling towards him has changed lately, understandably, his certain ways now that we are not together and I do not love him the same way after the split are making things worse too - I'm tired of it after having experienced that throughout our relationship, eve though he was the one that initiated the break up. We did initially talked about being friends but the longer time passed the more I am coming to conclusions it is something that will serve way more him than me - I do not need as much and as many close relationships with others as he does.

I am/would like to keep the love seat bought used for £120, mini dishwasher bought used for £110,  free bed frame upcycled and mattress and topper bought for around £230 and bedding, free non-upcycled chest of drawers, gifted by him wardrobe worth £160; 3 items gifted by him: bike worth £1k, bike computer worth £500 and pressure cooker worth £300 although technically they are gifts, old dyson hoover that he keeps complaining about how quickly it deteriorated so much + all the dogs' stuff. So without the gifts it'd be maybe £1k including the battered down dyson on its way out. We might split some kitchenware too althoug hmost of them deteriorated quite a bit.

There's a lot other furnire we co-owe some of them got for free and upcycled - 2 bookcases, dining tabl with 2 chairs, coffee table. Plus 2 ottomans/storage, billy book case with doors - narrow one. I think all the ones we paid for came down to almost £5k (including the sofa and TV) as I amde a spreadsheet to evaluate them.

I was thinking of some options:

1.	⁠to ask him how much would he spend on sofa, TV and bed if he was to buy it if he had extra cash. Divide it by half and ask to pay me that- could use one of he furniture listing on eBay so he can use his credit card as he has no cash right now. Or him buying me some things I will need: mini electric oven for £150, tow bar bike carrier for my car - used or new around £150.
2.	⁠Or ask him to provide services in near future: such as pick up second hand garden shed in a van he has and put it up, he'll help me move and will need to attach the furniture to the walls and bike clamps to keep them indoor. When I move next to help me fill the holes and move and do some light DIY, service my bikes when needed etc. Generally he is very good handy man and helpful although an ex s who knows when new woman comes into the picture. When we were together he promised to fit dashcams and mudguards for my car that I paid for so could include that in ""services"".
3.	⁠Sell the goods and give him half as originally planned so he can buy things with that cash. E.g. I would get sofa for £300 o so via fb marketplace myself and probably find free bed frame as many people would get rid of it if collected by someone else. New mattress could be £100-200 and bedding around £100 - so already £600; not sure how much the cheapest playstation compatible TV would be (he plays it with his sons).

And getting it in writing whatever we agreed and signed by both of us so no selected amnesia/recall.

Any ideas and solutions that might be helpful? Or shall I just let him have that furniture as he's in worse financial situation although it is due to his poor budgeting skills and financial impulsivity rather than bad circumstances etc. I was stupid enough to offer him to help as I had some savings

TL;DR Co own around £5k and split up recently. Ex owns me 6k. Each keeps a dog as we have 2 - will need help dog sitting when on holiday. He wants expensive furniture bought for £3k for free. Looking for ways to manage shared assets. 1.	⁠to ask him how much would he spend on those if he was to buy it if he had extra cash. Divide it by half and ask to pay me that- could use one of he furniture listing on eBay so he can use his credit card as he has no cash right now. Or him buying me some things I will need. 
2.	⁠Or ask him to provide services in near future: DIY and bike servicing. 
3.	⁠Sell the goods and give him half as originally planned so he can buy things with that cash. 4. Just give him the furniture as he’s got no cash and in worse financial situation (although self imposed). And get it in writing whatever the outcome.

I said I understand and that I don't want to be jumping into relationship either, but would like to continue to hang out, take things slow and see what happens, and she responded with sorry if it wasn't the answer I was hoping for and to text her when I get home, so I did and said thanks for such a great time and I hope to see her soon.

I ended my six months relationship a few weeks ago. We are both working professionals, 32 and 33, and enjoyed a couple of nice trips and dates. There were talks of her moving in with me and getting a cat. She told me I was the one and I love you in the first months. But every week we would clash about basically anything. I suspected her to be immature and untreated ADHD. She would stand me up for coffee dates and would prioritize herself instead of us. Meanwhile, I was having trouble sharing my space with another person constantly. I like/need structure and wish this from a partner. I voiced this to her too, but she seemed incapable.

We ended things abruptly. It was one morning when I was prepping for work and she remained in bed while she also needed to get ready, the night before we agreed to get up 7.30am. However, she was not getting ready, morning moody. I, with the intent of staying gentle and tender, I made her some coffee to get things going. It became a fight and I asked her to leave. When she didn't, I snapped and threw a bottle low-hand to the door. She was shocked obviously and grabbed her things. 

We texted and called for long hours and once met up again for a night, it was chaotic to say the least, with new bickering, but also flirting and giving each other feedback. I apologized deeply for my bottle-throwing. She said she would listen better and she acknowlished she is moody. She will go into therapy and not date for a few months she says. Relatively felt good about ending it on this note.

The six months were bickering on a weekly basis about planning things together, using weed and alcohol, her tiny social circle in my country (she's technically an expat), and more.

She doesn't keep in touch with exes which is the hardest adjustment for me. Also, I'm going into therapy to see why I just couldn't break up with her in a normal state, something from past relationships must've boiled up in me.

Before they even get a word out, frantically dig through your pockets and shout, “I just gave you all my money! Wasn’t that enough?!” Hold out an empty coffee cup or lint ball as proof. Bonus points if you start crying about how you can’t keep being their victim every Tuesday. No criminal wants to look greedy.

---

2. Summon Your Imaginary Henchmen

Look over their shoulder and say, “Oh, you’re gonna regret this. Barry, release the badgers!” Then act disappointed when no badgers appear, muttering, “They never show up on time.” Criminals hate it when their victim has backup—especially if it’s feral wildlife.

---

3. Speak Only in Ancient Prophecies

Switch to a foreboding tone and whisper: “So, the Chosen One has come to steal the wallet of destiny. Do you not fear the curse of the Leather Pouch?” If they hesitate, follow up with: “Legend says whoever robs me will lose their car keys forever. Forever.” Criminals can’t operate without transportation, so this one hits hard.

---

4. Pretend You’re in Training for a More Dangerous Job

When they threaten you, laugh maniacally and shout, “YES! Finally, my mock-mugging training begins!” Then start critiquing their technique: “Your stance is all wrong. If you were really serious, you’d be holding the knife like this.” The idea that you’re using them as practice will completely throw them off their game.

---

5. Offer a Trade They Can’t Refuse

When they demand your wallet, hold up something ridiculous like a pinecone or a single shoe and whisper, “You don’t want my money. You want this.” Then add, “It’s the only thing that keeps the portal closed.” They might not believe you, but they won’t want to risk being wrong.

---

6. Invent a Long-Lost Connection

Gasp dramatically and shout, “Wait, aren’t you Cousin Terry’s kid? Wow, you’ve grown! He told me you’d get into trouble one day.” Hug them awkwardly while whispering, “I won’t tell Aunt Carol if you just walk away now.” Criminals hate being roped into fictional family reunions.

---

7. Start Speaking in a Completely Made-Up Language

When confronted, look terrified and blurt out a stream of nonsense like, “Glorp zagnog! Flibber tock donka FLEEP!” Then gasp and clutch your head as if you’ve accidentally triggered something terrible. If they look confused, shout, “Oh no! The prophecy is real!” and run. Even hardened criminals can’t handle interdimensional gibberish.

---

8. Pretend They’re on a Hidden Camera Show—But You’re the Host

Point at them dramatically and yell, “We got him, folks! He really thought he could rob someone in broad daylight!” Act like a camera crew is closing in, high-fiving an imaginary boom operator. Start interviewing the criminal: “So, what’s it like being caught on Gotcha, Muggers!?!” Few criminals are prepared for the humiliation of fake TV stardom.

---

9. Stage an Exorcism—On Them

Pull out an imaginary crucifix (or a breadstick if available) and shout, “The power of common decency compels you!” Then sprinkle invisible holy water and scream, “OUT, foul spirit of thievery!” By the time you’re writhing on the ground chanting, “Begone, Wallet Demon!” they’ll be long gone.

---

10. Turn the Tables and Mug Them Instead

Flip the script. Interrupt their threat with, “Give me your wallet!” Look them dead in the eye and add, “Unless you’ve got two wallets, this feels like a fair trade.” Criminals aren’t prepared for counter-muggings and might even hand you their phone out of sheer panic.

---

11. Claim You’re Training for an Action Movie

Pull out your phone and pretend to film them, shouting, “And... action! Okay, try threatening me again, but with more emotion. Remember, you’re robbing me because your dreams of becoming a chef never worked out. Dig into that pain!” Give them acting tips until they forget they’re not auditioning for something.

---

12. Introduce Them to Your “Dangerous Alter Ego”

Suddenly change your posture, drop your voice an octave, and mutter, “You shouldn’t have done that. Now you’ve woken up The Lizard.” Start hissing and darting your tongue like a reptile. Nothing derails a mugging like the fear that their victim is possibly venomous.

---

13. Fake a Government Experiment

Hold up a random object, like a pen, and shout, “DO NOT MOVE! This anti-mugging prototype is still experimental!” Start beeping and making explosion noises while waving the pen around. Then mutter, “Last time it vaporized someone. Shame about Bob.” Criminals don’t like being vaporized, even hypothetically.

---

14. Leave Them a Heartfelt Yelp Review

Before they leave, say, “I rate this mugging a 3/10. Your approach lacked finesse, and you didn’t even wear a ski mask. Do better next time!” Then hand them an imaginary comment card with tips like, “Be more intimidating” or “Consider using a catchphrase.” No one wants to be a poorly-reviewed criminal.

---

15. End With a Life-Affirming Lesson

After you’ve thoroughly baffled them, stare deeply into their eyes and whisper, “You don’t have to do this. There’s still time to turn your life around. Have you considered pottery? Or birdwatching? Birds never rob anyone.” Hand them a fake business card for a birdwatching club and walk away. Criminals love being given options, especially ones that involve warblers.

---

Final Thoughts: Leave Them Wondering Forever

By the time you’re done, the criminal won’t just leave empty-handed—they’ll leave questioning their entire existence. They’ll sit in a dark room for weeks, clutching their cursed wallet, wondering if they’re actually related to you or why no badgers ever showed up. Congratulations.

Maybe she didn’t see and hear me? I was cold so I decided to go home and wait for her, because sometimes she just enjoys sitting outdoors and enjoy nature and a good book!

I waited the whole night and she didn’t come home!!

What did I do wrong?

Next morning, she pretended everything was cool and she even mentioned the snow we had the day before? So did she really not see me? But why did she not come home then?

* **Living Room:** Place a trio of metallic pendants over a coffee table or at varying heights for a designer-inspired touch.
* **Bedroom:** Add a warm glow with [hanging lights for bedroom](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights), featuring metallic frames or diffusers.

# 3. Go Big on Outside Hanging Lights

For outdoor spaces, [outside hanging lights](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/lighting/outdoor-pendant-lights) are a cost-effective way to add drama and style.

Where you hang your lights can significantly impact how they look. Proper placement can make even the simplest light fixtures appear more elegant:

* **Living Room:** Center your **hanging lights for living room** over a seating area or a coffee table to create a focal point.
* **Bedroom:** Install a pendant light on either side of the bed as an alternative to traditional bedside lamps for a sleek, modern look.
* **Outdoor Spaces:** Hang **outside hanging lights** above a dining table or seating area to create a cozy and inviting ambiance.

# Final Thoughts

1hfezex,https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1hfezex/im_realizing_my_extreme_carb_cravings_might/,I'm realizing my extreme carb cravings. Might actually be due to adrenal fatigue and not candida,"I'm currently just looking back at a lot of symptoms in my life. And I would say 10 years  ago it got the worse, with dealing with stress. And I remember specifically getting pain in both the kidneys back then, but I didn't realize that's what was occurring. I thought it was just pain in the stomach from stress that went away. 

I had other traumatic events before that, but during that time 10 years ago. Is when I remember I would start to stress eat, really heavy. And I've never not been skinny in my entire life, so there wasn't no shame in gaining weight or anything either. 

But I would say in the last 15 years, is when I developed out of control anxiety. Like most of the time I would be cool, but if it was a situation I couldn't control or make sense of. My adrenals would be going into overdrive. And due to that heavy stress eating of car a and sugars, I eventually developed candida over time and it just got worse and worse. 

I get pain from both my adrenals and I'm skinny but always had a bloated belly aka an adrenal belly. But I get this really bad pain on the left kidney, which I feel may be a tumor and a sign of Addison's disease. 

But this kind of is unfortunate, because now I know I won't be able to heal candida. Until this kidney situation is back in order, so I'll have to keep my carb intake up, take it easy on physical activities, pay attention to my salt and potassium. So yeah it wasn't the candida that had me devouring carbs, it was the high cortisol from my adrenals and hormones being out of order. 

I gotta set up an appointment with an endocrinologist very soon though. And probably add some stress relieving herbs to keep my cortisol from going crazy. Its making a lot of sense why I was so high strung and wired these past years. And I was drinking lots of caffeine before, just making matters worse and wondering why I wasn't feeling the energy from the coffee. 

This why I've been saying lately. Some of us have to get all organs checked out. Because you'll be wondering why your not making progress in the candida cleanse. Meanwhile one or more of your organs, isn't functioning right to get the job done to cleanse out the toxins well enough. ",3,1734339114.0,Candida,0,1.0,False

Whether you're looking for a [blue and white carpet](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/blue-and-white-rug) to complement a coastal theme, [round rugs for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/textiles/rugs/round-rugs) to soften a space, or the best [rugs Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs), selecting the right rug for each room requires a balance of style, functionality, and comfort.

Here’s a guide to help you choose the perfect rug for every room in your home.

# 1. Why Rugs Matter in Home Decor

Rugs are more than just decorative elements; they add texture, warmth, and personality to a room. The right rug can:

* Define and anchor a space.
* Absorb sound for a quieter, more comfortable ambiance.
* Protect flooring while adding style.

# 2. Choosing the Right Rug for Each Room

# Living Room

The living room is the heart of the home, and a rug can enhance its aesthetic and comfort.

* **Rugs for Living Room:** Rectangular rugs are a classic choice to anchor your seating area. Ensure the rug is large enough to accommodate at least the front legs of your furniture.
* **Round Rugs for Living Room:** If you’re looking to add softness and curves to your living room, a round rug can create a cozy and dynamic focal point. It works well under coffee tables or in smaller, intimate spaces.

**Style Tip:** A **blue and white carpet** can bring a fresh and timeless look to your living room, especially if paired with neutral furniture or coastal-inspired decor.

# Bedroom

In the bedroom, rugs should add warmth and comfort underfoot while complementing your decor.

* Place a large rug under the bed, ensuring it extends beyond the sides and foot of the bed.
* For smaller rooms, consider runners on either side of the bed for a cozy touch.

**Material Tip:** Opt for soft, plush rugs for added comfort in the bedroom.

# Dining Room

When selecting a rug for the dining room, prioritize durability and ease of cleaning.

* Choose a rug that’s large enough to fit the table and chairs, even when the chairs are pulled out.
* Avoid high-pile rugs to make cleaning spills easier.

**Style Tip:** A patterned **blue and white carpet** can hide minor stains while adding a classic look to your dining space.

# Kitchen

A rug in the kitchen adds comfort to hard flooring and can define cooking or dining areas.

* Choose durable, low-pile rugs that are easy to clean.
* Consider runner rugs for narrow galley kitchens or small rugs for workstations.

# Bathroom

For bathrooms, focus on rugs that can handle moisture and frequent cleaning.

* Opt for smaller, absorbent rugs near sinks or bathtubs.
* Non-slip backing is essential for safety.

# Outdoor Spaces

Outdoor rugs bring style and functionality to patios, balconies, or decks.

* Choose weather-resistant materials like polypropylene for durability.
* Neutral or patterned rugs can enhance outdoor seating or dining areas.

# 3. Key Factors to Consider When Choosing Rugs

# Size

* **Living Room:** Ensure the rug is large enough to anchor furniture.
* **Dining Room:** The rug should extend at least 24 inches beyond the table’s edges.
* **Bedroom:** A large rug under the bed or runners on either side work best.

# Material

* **Wool:** Durable and soft, ideal for high-traffic areas.
* **Cotton:** Affordable and easy to clean, great for casual spaces.
* **Synthetic Fibers:** Stain-resistant and durable, perfect for homes with kids or pets.
* **Natural Fibers:** Jute or sisal rugs add texture and an eco-friendly touch.

# Color and Pattern

* A **blue and white carpet** can add a fresh, airy vibe to any room.
* Neutral tones work well for minimalist designs.
* Bold patterns make a statement in otherwise understated spaces.

Recently got obsessed with Moka Pot as it peaked my interest and bought a Bialetti 6 cup Moka Pot as it is enough for making 2-3 regular cups. 

For my first brew: I had cleaned my Moka Pot with water brewing and discarding the first 2 coffee brews to get rid of the metallic smell or any metal residue as recommended by Bialleti. I used the Winter blend from Blue Tokai (an Indian specialty coffee brad) which ground to a little coarser consistency than an Espresso grind. Had put but hot water (90 degrees almost) in the base and filled the filter upto the brim without pressing it. Used a Bialetti induction plate on the gas stove for heating on low heat.

Overall, a successful brew with no bitterness as such when diluted with a little amount of water for drinking but felt a little more acidic for my taste.

Please give recommendations on my technique and any blends/ single estate coffees which tastes best in a Moka Pot. Thanks in advance! :)

Your bedroom is your personal retreat, so choose furniture that promotes relaxation and suits your style.

* **Bedframe and Mattress:** Opt for a sturdy, stylish bedframe that fits the dimensions of your room. A padded headboard can add a luxurious touch.

* **Decorative Accents:** Use a **rattan coffee table** or woven baskets for storage to add a natural touch.

1hfeq3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chiropractic/comments/1hfeq3h/mystery_breathing_problem_with_back_and_chest_pain/,Mystery breathing problem with back and chest pain,"Hello everyone, trying to figure out what the hell is going on with me. It all started this past November when i woke up ij the middle of the night with shortness of breath. Seemed like i was having a panic attack but it took hours to wear off before I could finally go to sleep. Felt like my heart was going to explode (spoiler alert it didn’t). The next day i was back to feeling normal. Had coffee and breakfast, a lovely morning and then went about my work day. As I headed to my jobsite it seemed like another breathing attack was occurring. I had been working in a dusty renovation project for several weeks (years really) so I thought maybe allergies had just triggered some asthma. I go to urgent care feeling like I couldn’t breathe especially because a mysterious nasal congestion episode had started in the mornings when i’d wake up which had never happened before. Expecting the urgent care doctor to chalk it up to something simple, she goes “uh oh you need to go to the ER” I say “WHAT…why?” She says something isn’t right with your EKG. I say well what is it like a panic attack or stress she says no. I had “inverted t waves with possible ischemia”. Instead of going to the ER I went to another urgent care where the doctor who had more experience with ekgs said “this is normal, it’s transient and non specific and the chest pain you’re having seems like costocondritis”
Oh alright! I brushed it off and by the end of the day i mostly felt ok but a little sore. Throughout the week i noticed there was a difficulty reaching the top of my breath like I was oxygen starved. My oxygen levels and blood test were normal. Chest x ray negative. Though at this time my blood pressure was about 150/100 or so and usually its at a 130 so my bp is on the higher side (i’m 5’10 170 lbs so pretty normal/thin but cholesterol on the higher side of normal). I was mostly ok at this point since I felt like ok maybe I have a virus or something though no cough. The weekend comes and on Saturday night i’m in so much discomfort and breathlessness I have my friend take me to the ER in the middle of the night. The doctor sees me and gods you’re ultimately fine it’s just stress. My Bp had peaked to 170! But after the doctor came it went back down to 130 so clearly i was nervous and stressed. I was able to go home and sleep normal and started feeling a little better. I saw my pcp a few days later he chalked it up to stress and asthma thorough he was concerned with my latest ekg from the er which did in fact show more evidence of inverted t waves and possibly ischemia + tachycardia than the previous ekg so he refers me to the cardiologist just to be sure. The weekend comes. i stay up late, drinking with friends and each night I feel worse and worse. I normally drink weekends once a month or so when I’m feeling social and not too busy. So i figured i’d feel better…i didnt and starting getting intense chest and back pain on top of the shortness of breath and “stuck” feeling that i was missing my ability to reach deep breaths. It felt like my bodyweight was suffocating myself and i couldn’t find a comfortable position to sleep in no matter what I did, i felt like i was suffocating on my own weight. Sleep was impossible and no matter how i tried sleeping i couldn’t so now insomnia episodes started plus the bizarre sinus/nasal congestion. I thought to myself could i have been slowly suffocating in my sleep due to nasal congestion since I cant usually sleep unless i breath through my nose. By the following weekend i ended up back in the er which by now my ekg was back to normal and ER heart ultrasound looked normal and they just felt it was stress even though i was in so much physical pain. They gave me norco for costochondritis and sent me home. Now i had another problem—I couldn’t sleep at all no matter what. This exacerbated all my symptoms and just made me feel crazy. I kept being told it was anxiety and I believed it since I do have a highly stressful life with minimal self care. The norco wasn’t really helping and i kept having to wait it out. The sleep deprivation was causing my body to twitch and my brain to feel overloaded. It was pure hell. Eventually i started sleeping more and more and stopped sleeping on the uncomfortable pull out bed that seemed to trigger a lot of my symptoms. I’d wake up and my breathing muscles just felt so sore. Sleeping on my old mattress (my apartment was partially under construction so I moved to a completed job site though cleaned out was dusty so at this point i just figured id sleep in my old apartment since the new location wasn’t furnished except for the pull out bed) and id seem to improve the next day. By the time i started sleeping again, i realized wait…i dont have stress and anxiety this is something else! 

This is where it gets interesting. Desperate for answers I started digging and i realized, wait a sec! I was in a car accident 5 months prior and got harsh whiplash so for 3 months i went to the chiropractor who did some pretty harsh adjustments but it always felt good after. I never felt any serious pain afterwords but around the time i had moved 3months after chiro treatment i 1) stopped cold turkey 2) started sleeping on that uncomfortable mattress 3) started having the weird nasal congestion which seemed to mostly go away after i tried using propolis spray. So little by little it seemed i was improving and i finally bought a new mattress that seemed very comfortable though a little softer than my old one. The 1st night my body felt like it was adjusting to the new one the 2nd and 3rd nights it felt like i slept great! Though i was still having rapid heart beat episodes and felt like “gosh if i can just control my bp i bet the chest pain will go away” exercise felt good to do and so i started jogging more. Felt fine, a little better, then got back into work mode and stopped the exercise and healing focus. Then this time, the following week when the pain came back i had another episode of insomnia and “feeling like my body cant support its weight without suffocating” i figured out i need some exercise so a 10 minute jog 5mph a little inclined. This time exercise wasn’t feeling good afterwords and it seemed to trigger more breathlessness. Freaking out worried that i have some sort of degenerative disease though my blood tests and inflammatory markers were all normal. Seemed like my breathing mechanics were very sore and somewhat worse than the whole month.

So i’m assuming i actually have a misalignment and need to go back to the chiro. I dont know if the original chiro messed me up or what or if stopping going and sleeping on a crummy surface gradually screwed me up as simple as it sounds. Would love your insights and recs!!

A strong sense of déjà vu washed over me as I followed the raven’s lead. The places I drove past felt eerily familiar, as if plucked straight from my dream – though in reality, the journey felt far more longer.

I drove for nearly two days straight, taking only brief naps along the way.

Strangely, the raven seemed to sense when my exhaustion became unbearable and it would perch quietly on a nearby tree, waiting, as I rested.

Then, when it was time to resume the journey, it would swoop near my car and let out a sudden, sharp caw, jolting me awake and back into motion.

After covering thousands of miles, I finally arrived at a small town that matched the vivid image from my dream. The raven guided me all the way to a house, circling twice above it before flying off.

The house with the purple door - the neatly decorated foyer, and the tidy garden beside it.

But one key detail was different - within the same compound stood another smaller building at the far end, like a guest house or quarters, with a ""For Rent"" sign hanging from its gate.

My heart raced as I sat in the car, staring at the purple door.

None of this made any sense, yet here I was, in a strange little town, with no clue what to expect.

*Who would open that door if I rang the bell?* I silently thought to myself.

I grabbed the bag, stepped out of the car, and walked toward the entrance. As I approached, I noticed an exotic array of flowers flanking both ends of the portico—marigolds, chrysanthemums, lilies, tulips, and vibrant bougainvilleas, their colors creating a striking display.

 With a deep breath I stopped in front of the purple door and rang the bell.

When it opened, an older woman, likely in her late sixties, stood at the entrance.

She was of medium build, dressed in a floral gown that gave her an air of simple elegance. Her hair was neatly pinned back into a tidy bun, and large horn-rimmed glasses framed her inquisitive eyes.

""Yes?"" she asked, her tone polite yet measured, as she peered at me through the thick lenses.

""Good evening, ma'am,"" I greeted her, with a small nod. ""I'm Emily Moore. I happened to be passing through this town and noticed the 'For Rent' sign on your property.""

 ""I'm traveling and was hoping you might consider renting the space to me for a short stay.""

“Hello Emily, glad to meet you and please call me Martha,” she responded, breaking into a warm smile as I shook her hand.

“The guest house is certainly available for rent. How long are you planning to stay?”

“I’m looking to stay for a month, maybe longer,” I replied, quickly concocting a story about how I was conducting research on the local history and folklore of the town and its surrounding areas.

She nodded thoughtfully, listening with genuine interest, before outlining the terms and conditions.

After I paid a small advance, she disappeared inside to retrieve the keys and returned a few moments later, then led me to the guest house.

As we walked through the garden, I couldn’t help but admire the neat rows of vegetables that had been carefully planted, resembling a tiny market in its own right.

Martha next inserted the key into the door and opened it, gesturing for me to enter.

The guest house, though small, was cozy and well maintained, offering all the essentials— a cot, kitchenette, attached bath, TV, and refrigerator. She placed the key in a bowl and wished me goodnight as she quietly closed the door behind me.

I set the Chanel bag on a nearby chair and sat down on the bed, just to momentarily rest my sore back. But the exhaustion immediately hit me like a tidal wave, and all I could think of was sleep.

I removed the medallion from my pocket and set it on the bedside table, then lay down, drifting off into a deep, immediate slumber.

When I opened my eyes, I could sense that dawn had broken, but I remained motionless, unwilling to leave the warmth of the bed.

Yet, something had jolted me from my sleep, and then I heard it again.

A siren, distant at first, but growing louder and more urgent with every passing second.

Panic surged through me, and I sat up, eyes darting around the room. Everything appeared normal, untouched, but the siren’s wail only intensified.

I rushed to the front door and tried to open it. But it was wedged tight, as though something was holding it shut from the outside. Desperate, I pushed through hard, managing just enough space to peek through.

My heart stopped when I saw Martha lying on the ground, a pool of blood surrounding her.

I pushed the door with all my strength, and it finally gave way, causing Martha’s body to roll over the doorstep and into the garden. Stumbling out of the house, I watched in horror as her blood soaked into the soil.

The sirens pierced the air as I stood motionless, waiting for fate to take its course, watching the compound fill with police cars, as officers spilled out of the vehicles, guns drawn.

My eyes snapped open again as I lay in bed, realizing I had just been jolted awake from yet another unsettling dream.

 Before I could shake off the lingering shivers, I heard a knock on the front door.

I sat up straight, immediately pinching myself to ensure I wasn’t trapped in a dream within a dream.

When the sting shot through me, I jumped out of bed and hurried to the door, my mind already racing with worry about what would happen next.

To my surprise and relief, I found Martha standing at the doorstep, smiling with a breakfast tray in hand.

“Good morning, Emily,” she greeted me warmly. “Sorry if I spooked you,” she added, noticing the worried look on my face. “I saw your car parked in the same spot since yesterday, and I wondered if you’d had anything decent to eat. So I thought I’d bring you something.”

“Nothing fancy—just some stew made with our home grown produce and hot coffee for you,” she said, extending the tray.

I accepted it gratefully, but my gaze drifted to a young man working in the garden—a boy about 16 or 17. The basket he held in hand was filled with tomatoes, carrots, lettuce, cucumbers, zucchini, and bell peppers. Martha noticed my gaze and immediately explained.

“This is Alex, one of my neighbors. He’s a strong young man with a good head on his shoulders. He likes to help an old lady like me out,” she said with a fond smile. The young boy raised his hat at me before getting back to work.

“Thank you so much for this, Martha. I’m famished, I won’t lie,” I said finally to Martha as I held the tray.

She gave me a knowing smile and turned to head back to her house, but paused before looking back at me.

“Tell you what, why don’t you join me for lunch later today? I know you haven’t had time to set up yet. Please, come by my place any time after 1. And I am not taking no for an answer. Great, that’s settled then” She gave me a final smile before continuing her walk, leaving me stranded at the doorway before I even had the time to respond.

I closed the door and set the tray on the bed, my gaze immediately drawn to the medallion on the table. So much had happened in the last five minutes, and it was all making my head spin.

After what happened at the bank, I didn’t want anyone else getting hurt, especially not ending up dead—much less bringing the police into my life again.

Just the thought of it made my stomach twist, and I considered packing up and moving immediately. 

But something inside me kept me rooted.

Maybe I was where I was supposed to be.

After all, the raven led me here, to this town, and perhaps even to this house. Maybe, just maybe, I could pick up something on Ben.

Meanwhile the first spoonful of stew was heavenly. I couldn’t tell if it was Martha’s cooking or simply the fact that I hadn’t eaten properly in days, but it was pure bliss nevertheless. It just seemed to melt in my mouth and was easily the best thing I’d tasted in ages. I devoured the rest quickly, and washed it down with the hot coffee.

I next set about organizing the place with the few belongings I had.

I carefully pulled the cash out of my bag and spread it under the mattress, hiding it as best I could.

As I shoved the empty bag beneath the bed, the sound of something shifting caught my attention. Ducking down to investigate, I spotted an empty bowl that still carried the faint, sour scent of old milk.

But what truly made my skin crawl was the pile of snake skin beneath the cot, lying in a small heap, dried and crumpled, possibly remnants of a shedding.

My senses went on high alert as I began carefully combing the room for any signs of a serpent.

The small quarters didn’t take long to search, and I was nearly done when my eyes eventually landed on a wooden cupboard across the room, its door slightly ajar.

I approached it cautiously, opened it, and scanned the shelves. It was empty. But something else caught my attention—a floorboard beneath the cupboard was slightly loose.

I pried it open and stopped in my tracks.

Beneath it lay Ben’s cell phone, its screen cracked, and beside it, his Colt Python revolver—the gun he always carried. A chill ran down my spine as the weight of the discovery sank in.

The cellphone was dead and gone. So I picked up the pistol and checked the chamber; it still had five rounds left.

*So* *where is Ben now? Why did he leave his things here? Why did he come to this town, just like I did? And of all places, why this particular house? Is he still lingering somewhere in this town? Is the medallion, in its own mysterious way, trying to bring the two of us back together?*

But then a darker thought crossed my mind—*what if he’s no longer alive?*

The possibility made my chest tighten painfully.

On one hand, I felt a glimmer of relief, finally uncovering clues about his disappearance, which had haunted me for weeks.

On the other, a growing sense of dread began to take hold. Now that I was closer to the truth, I wasn’t sure if I truly wanted to uncover it.

One thing was certain though—the answers lay in the house at the other end of the garden. As I looked across the rows of neatly laid-out plants, a familiar sense of unease crept over me, and I began to fear for my safety once again. But I knew there was no turning back now.

I showered and got ready for my lunch with Martha. Tucking the pistol securely into the small of my back, I set off toward her house.

As I walked through the small garden, my mind drifted back to the incident at the pawn shop a few months ago, the memory surfacing as vividly as if it had just happened yesterday.

“Elise… Elise… ELISE!” Ben’s voice echoed through the store, startling me. I turned to see him standing frozen, his face a mix of horror and subtle amusement.

His eyes darted between my face and my hands, and when I followed his gaze, I froze.

I was holding both medallions—one ruby-encrusted, the other emerald-encrusted.

I didn’t even remember picking them up.

Mesmerized, I simply stood there, oblivious to the store assistant’s warnings, clutching the auric seals of Teotihuacan.

The emerald medallion, in particular, burned itself into my memory. It featured a serpent coiled around an hourglass—a detail that now struck me as disturbingly significant.

Then the memory blurred again.  One moment I was inside the store, and the next, I was sprinting outside with both medallions clutched tightly in my hands.

In no time, the cops were in hot pursuit, with Ben desperately trying to outrace them.

“I’ll draw them away,” he finally said, as he pulled over near an underground tunnel, urging me to escape on foot.

I hesitated, but as he kissed me goodbye, I shoved the emerald medallion into his hand, silently praying he’d make it. I watched as he sped off, the sirens growing louder in the distance.

 

Now, back in the present, I found myself standing before the purple door.

I rang the bell, and Alex appeared almost instantly, wearing an apron and welcoming me inside with a friendly smile.

“Martha’s still in the kitchen,” he said, leading me to the living room.

I nervously glanced around the room. The house was modest yet inviting, and decorated with care. A large TV took center stage on the wall, with a single armchair angled toward it—suggesting quiet evenings spent alone.

On one of the other walls hung framed photographs, some showing Martha with a man of similar age, their smiles frozen in happier times.

“That’s Henry, my husband,” Martha said softly from behind me, her voice steady. I turned to see her pointing at one of the photos. “He passed away five years ago,” she added.

Martha and I sat down, exchanging small talk about everyday things. When the moment felt right, I pulled out Ben's photo and casually asked if she'd seen him, keeping my tone light to avoid raising any suspicion.

Martha shook her head, a slight frown crossing her face. “No, dear. No one’s stayed at my guest house for quite some time. We don’t get many visitors around here,” she replied quickly without batting an eyelid.

 I, of course, knew she was lying.

 “Shall we have lunch?” she asked quickly, her tone almost too casual, as though trying to divert the conversation, before swiftly making her way toward the dining table.

 Alex had already set the table, arranging an inviting spread: roasted chicken, green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, and a freshly baked apple pie. The aroma filled the room, which would have ideally made my stomach growl in anticipation, but all it did now was deepen my suspicions.

The gun pressed against my back as I eased into my seat, and I silently prayed I wouldn’t be forced to use it.

Martha moved with practiced calm, pouring iced tea for everyone, while Alex meticulously served generous portions of chicken onto each plate

“What will I do when you leave, kiddo?” Martha said, looking at Alex with a fond, wistful expression. “Our boy here will be heading off to Harvard this summer on a full scholarship to study law,” she added, turning to me, her voice filled with pride.

As she down, Martha served more food, moving deftly across the platters.

I waited patiently for the two of them to start eating before I put a morsel of food in my mouth. The food was obviously delicious but my appetite by this point had already been killed.

Then, as Martha reached across the table for more potatoes, something glinted at her neck.

I froze. The emerald medallion swung from a gold chain around her throat - its distinctive serpent coiling around an hourglass—impossible to miss.

My stomach clenched as my mind began to race.

Martha, even as she noticed the color draining from my face, calmly spooned more mashed potatoes onto her plate, her expression serene and almost nonchalant.

Alex remained engrossed in his meal, while I shifted nervously in my seat.

The food in my mouth felt stuck  at the back of my throat as I struggled to swallow, causing me to suddenly erupt into a coughing fit.

 I grabbed for my iced tea in a panic, but as I tried to place it back on the table, it slipped from my grasp and crashed to the floor.

“Alex, why don’t you bring Emily another glass?” Martha intervened, gesturing toward the kitchen.

Before Alex could react, I stood up quickly, raising a hand to stop him. “I’ll get it,” I said, my voice abrupt.

I needed a moment away from them, away from the room.

In the kitchen, I gripped the counter, steadying myself as I reached for a glass. That’s when I heard it—clear and unmistakable.

“Elise… Elise… ELISE!”

The voice sent a jolt through me. It was Ben. It was Ben’s voice. My heart raced as I turned toward the hall.

The television, which had been off moments ago, was now turned on. A grainy video played on the screen, displaying security footage from the pawn shop.

My legs moved on their own, carrying me back into the living room where I collapsed into a chair, my knees almost giving away.

On the screen, the footage played like a nightmare brought to life.

There I was, standing in the shop, holding the medallions in both hands, my eyes locked in a daze, wild with desire as Ben started to speak louder and louder trying to get my attention.

The shop assistant, Pete, looked alarmed, gesturing for me with his hands to put the medallions down.

But I ignored them both, my grip tightening as I stared at the medallions, completely mesmerized.

It wasn’t until Ben placed a firm hand on my shoulder and gave me a hard shake that I finally broke free from the spell.

Reluctantly, I set the medallions back on the tray, my fingers hesitating as if they didn’t want to let go.

When I turned to look at Ben, his expression was a curious mix of amusement and quiet resolve.

But I knew him too well—behind that facade was the man I had fallen in love with, someone would do anything to give me what I wanted.

 I knew exactly what he was about to do as he turned to face Pete.

“Okay. I think I’d like to buy these. What’s it going to cost?” he asked, looking at Pete.

Pete, already visibly annoyed, scoffed. “Oh, come on, Ben. I’m not in the mood for this. Just last month, you came here to sell your ring because you were short on cash.”

“I mean it,” Ben pressed, his voice unwavering. “I want to buy them. I don’t care if they’re cursed. Tell me what it’s going to cost.”

Pete glared at him, exasperated, before finally spitting out, “Three hundred thousand dollars.” His tone dripped with disdain as he eyed the two of us, clearly expecting Ben to back down.

I nudged Ben urgently, whispering that it was time to leave, but the air between the two men crackled with tension. As Pete moved to return the tray to its place, Ben and I turned eventually to leave the store—then he stopped abruptly.

What happened next was something I could never fully understand or admit to myself even after all these months.

Ben’s face went cold, his expression vacant, like he’d fallen into a trance of his own. Without a word, he drew his revolver and fired.

The deafening shot echoed through the shop as Pete crumpled to the floor, lifeless. I gasped, my hands instinctively covering my mouth in shock.

Ben had always carried a firearm, but he wasn’t the kind of man to shoot first. He was not the trigger happy sort.

In fact he had never aimed that weapon at another person before, until that point. But now he stood motionless, his face unreadable.

“Pick up the medallions,” he said finally, his voice sharp and commanding.

Still in shock, I did as told, and together, we fled the shop, the medallions clutched tightly in my grasp.

The video suddenly came to a stop as the TV screen went blank.

Except for the sound of my own breathing, the room fell silent and the silence became suffocating as I felt two pairs of eyes looking straight at me, waiting patiently for me to react.

Summoning what little courage I had left, I forced myself to meet Martha's gaze. Her eyes were unwavering, cold and accusing, while her fingers absently fidgeted with the chain around her neck.

""My son, my only child is dead because of you,"" she said, her voice steady but quivering with restrained emotion. ""My own  flesh and blood. He was all I had left in this world, and you took him from me.""

""And all for what? For this?""

She lifted the medallion from her neck, its emerald surface faintly gleaming in the dim light.

Her face contorted with a mix of grief and contempt, while I sat frozen, paralyzed by guilt and unable to muster a response.

""You came all this way looking for your boyfriend, didn’t you? So take it. Find out for yourself.""

With a sudden flick, she sent the medallion sliding across the table, stopping just shy of my fingertips. Her words chilled me, but I slowly extended my hand, to pick up the medallion.

The moment my fingers closed around it, a sharp, searing pain shot through my head, blurring my vision. My head snapped back as a vivid, horrifying vision unfolded before me.

Ben appeared, his face breaking into a smile as he looked down where a serpent lay coiled on the floor with its hood up. He poured milk into a shallow bowl, and the snake drank from it.

The scene quickly shifted—Ben was now driving his car, the serpent wrapped around his arm. Each time the snake raised its hood, pointing left or right, Ben followed its silent command, turning the steering wheel accordingly.

The vision morphed again, this time to Martha's home. She sat on her couch, tears streaming down her face as she watched the security footage of her son’s murder on an endless loop.

The sound of a doorbell broke her from her misery, and she opened the door to find Ben standing there, smiling as he introduced himself.

I gasped as the vision ended, my body jerking back so suddenly that my head throbbed painfully. My temples pulsed as though they might split open.

Then, the scene shifted again—Ben was lying on the floor, clutching his throat, foaming at the mouth, while Martha silently stood over him, holding a half-consumed glass of iced tea.

At the same time, I felt something physically wrong with me as well. My body burned, like a violent fever was overtaking me.

Blood trickled from my nostrils, and the horrifying realization hit me—I had been poisoned, too.

My mind flashed to the iced tea served at the table. I was the only one who had touched it.

Dazed, I tried to rise from my seat, but my legs gave way, sending me crashing to the floor.

Alex rushed forward, steadying me with his hands as I struggled to stay conscious.

The moment his hands touched me, another vision surged through my mind with brutal force.

Alex stood in Martha’s living room, a meat cleaver glinting in his grasp. The blade arced through the air and came down with horrifying precision, striking Ben several times, who already lay lifeless on the floor.

The scene shifted again—Alex, burying Ben’s remains in shallow graves dug in the barren patch beside the house.

Days flickered by as Alex and Martha worked side by side, planting seeds in the freshly turned soil. Weeks blurred together, and the once-empty patch became a lush garden. The plants thrived, nourished by the horror that lay buried beneath.

The realization hit me like a truck: they had used those very vegetables from that garden to feed me.

My stomach churned violently as the nausea overwhelmed me. Staggering to my feet, I bolted for the door, desperate for air.

I stumbled into the garden, gulping in deep breaths, but the moment I took in my surroundings, the nausea returned with full force.

Doubling over, I retched, vomiting up the food I had just eaten, my body rejecting the horrifying truth.

When I turned back toward the house, Martha was standing there, watching me with a cold stare.

“Finish it,” she said, her voice steady and without remorse, as though this were a task no different from any other chore.

Behind her, Alex loomed, clutching a large knife in his hand.  In his other hand, he was holding Ben’s gun.

Instinctively, I reached for my back to check for my gun—but it was gone., I realized he must have deftly seized it when I had crashed to the floor.

Desperation surged through me as my hand found the ruby medallion in my pocket. Clutching both medallions in my hand ,I silently begged for a miracle even as my body teetered on the edge of collapse.

My temples burned as another vision took hold: this time I saw myself running into the guest quarters, flinging open the closet door, and grabbing another gun—just in time to stop Alex.

I threw both my medallions to the floor, staggered to my feet, and rushed toward the guesthouse, instinct pulling me toward the closet.

As I reached the closet , my hands  fumbled with the handle before finally throwing the door open.

Coiled inside the cupboard and hidden among the shadows, was a serpent. Its eyes glinted in the dim light before it lunged, sinking its fangs deep into my throat.

Pain erupted like fire, spreading rapidly through my veins. My body seized as the venom took hold, the strength draining from my limbs.

Darkness crept in at the edges of my vision, and I collapsed, the world fading as my consciousness slipped away.

When I woke, I had no sense of how much time had passed, but my body felt light, as if it had been restored to full health—as though I’d been reborn.

Ben's revolver lay beside me, cold and waiting. Next to it was the Chanel bag, brimming with cash. All the money I had hidden under the mattress had somehow been returned to the bag. I picked it up and stepped out cautiously, only to freeze at the sight before me.

Martha was lying face down in the grass, her throat slit, a crimson pool spreading beneath her. Nearby, Alex stood motionless, his expression distant, as though caught in a trance. In his hand, he gripped a bloodied knife.

As I emerged, his eyes flickered to me, and he dropped to one knee. “Your Highness,” he murmured, holding the knife aloft like an offering to royalty.

 My eyes however darted between the raven and the serpent lying still in the grass, their unblinking eyes locked on me, and the two medallions glinting on the ground between them.

Then, piercing through the suffocating silence, came the sound of sirens in the distance.

“What is happening?” I demanded, my voice trembling.

Alex’s gaze remained fixed on the ground. “It is the police,” he replied evenly. “I called them.”

“But why?” I asked, unable to hide my exasperation.

“You must make a choice, Your Highness,” he said, his voice calm yet unyielding.

“The medallions represent the future and the past. When you touched them for the first time, you became the natural custodian of the Auric Seals of Teotihuacan.”

His words sent a chill down my spine. “What does that mean?” I slowly asked.

“The medallions cannot be apart for long. They will always find a way get back together, no matter the cost—through whatever means necessary. ”

“But you hold the power now to decide how this story unfolds”

The sirens grew louder, closer, like a ticking clock urging me toward a decision.

“Pick up the medallions, Your Highness,” Alex said, his tone commanding yet reverent.

I hesitated before reaching down.

My fingers brushed the emerald-studded medallion, and a sharp pain shot through my forehead. A vision erupted in my mind—a harrowing glimpse of what was to come. I saw myself sitting on the grass, having abandoned the medallions and waiting for the police to arrive. Alex’s face, once composed, twisted into something unrecognizable. Without warning, he lunged at me, plunging the knife into my chest. The pain was visceral, and even within the vision, it left me gasping. I shuddered as the image dissolved.

My trembling hand moved to the ruby medallion. As I grasped it, another vision surged forward. This time, I saw myself running—driving away from the chaos as Alex charged toward the police, putting himself in harm's way in a desperate bid to buy me time. The visions faded, leaving me breathless and shaking.

“Have you made your choice, Your Highness?” Alex asked a moment later, his voice steady but his gaze firmly fixed on the ground.

I swallowed hard, nodding.

“Then give me the gun,” he said softly, extending his hand.

Reluctantly, I placed the revolver in his palm. Alex bowed once, solemn and final, before turning and sprinting toward the approaching sirens.

Shots rang out almost immediately as he fired at the sky before aiming his gun at the vehicles arriving in front of him.

I stumbled toward my car, the medallions and the bag of money clutched tightly in my hands. The serpent slithered onto the passenger seat, coiling itself with an eerie calm.

Overhead, the raven soared, charting a path forward as if guiding my escape.

I started the engine, the tires screeching as the car surged forward, speeding away just as a firefight ignited in the backdrop.

The road stretched ahead, an uncertain future waiting to unfold.

1hfengr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheTraveler/comments/1hfengr/how_many_days_do_you_need_at_the_grand_canyon/,How many days do you need at the Grand Canyon South Rim?,"Hey everyone! I just got back from an incredible Grand Canyon South Rim bus tour from Las Vegas, and I absolutely need to share my experience with you all. As someone who's always wanted to visit this natural wonder but wasn't sure about the logistics, this tour turned out to be perfect.

Let me break down my adventure. The tour started early (yes, you'll need your coffee!), but the hotel pickup made it super convenient. Our guide, Mike, was this incredibly knowledgeable dude who kept us entertained during the drive with fascinating facts about the desert landscape and local history.

The bus itself was pretty comfortable - air-conditioned with a bathroom onboard, which trust me, is essential for a 14-hour journey. We made a quick stop in Kingman, Arizona, which was a nice break to stretch and grab some snacks.

When we finally reached the South Rim, my jaw literally dropped. Photos don't do justice to how massive and colorful the canyon is. We visited multiple viewpoints, including Mather Point and Bright Angel Point, and each one offered a completely different perspective. Pro tip: bring your camera because these views are insane!

The included meal voucher came in handy, and the food was actually decent. What really made the experience special though were the optional upgrades. I splurged on the helicopter ride (worth every penny!), but there's also a Hummer tour option and an IMAX movie if that's more your style.

For anyone considering this tour, I booked through https://athometouch.com/SouthRim and the whole process was super smooth. At $80, it's honestly a steal considering everything that's included - transportation, guide, meals, and those million-dollar views.

One piece of advice: bring layers! The rim can get chilly even when Vegas is scorching. Also, don't forget to stay hydrated and wear comfortable shoes - you'll want to explore every viewpoint.

I've done quite a few tours around Vegas, but this Grand Canyon experience was definitely a highlight. If you're on the fence about booking, just do it. It's one of those bucket-list experiences that actually lives up to the hype.

The National Geographic Visitor Center was also pretty cool - lots of interesting exhibits about the canyon's formation and history. Really helps you appreciate what you're looking at even more.

Feel free to ask any questions in the comments! Happy to share more details about my experience or tips for making the most of your visit.",1,1734337527.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

 Everybody who worked in sales over the phone knows that moment, when you are calling cold-warm base. 

 It is difficult for a beginner to do that job, and as usual for a newcomer, that work exactly to practice and training gives. How to act in that situation, proficient seller and who has just stood on that way is different. 

 Let's look at the beginner's actions. Call and training in the field, understanding basics, improving pitch, and creating a contact with the client. Tell about the product to get to know more and move to the first sale. 

How act proficient sales manager is different. With knowledge about the product and skills in handling plenty of objections, just take back to the company customers with concerns or hidden issues either that didn't like service that previous manager provided to them. 

 Here it is also very important to receive feedback. To understand why the client didn't buy the product after showing interest and find a solution, how to cover demand with the proposed product. That system works with a warm base of customers who sign up before and haven't bought what was ordered, almost. 

 With cold base, situation a little bit more difficult, because they never showed that interest either in some relevant sources. Here you have to search for a person who has interest. Burn desire. Make the first few minutes full of impressions and ground to think about. Eventually the customer will think and will take their own decision. 

 To provide all the necessary information based on the needs of an individual customer will be the best way to make a sale for a subscriber potential or product user, either to a person who will buy from you.",1,1734337457.0,salestechniques,1,1.0,False

Two mechanics told me to flush the system but Mysyara is saying to replace the parts and then flush.,1,1734337385.0,DubaiPetrolHeads,6,0.67,False
1hfem2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheTraveler/comments/1hfem2e/where_to_walk_around_san_diego/,Where to walk around San Diego?,"Hey fellow Reddit travelers! I wanted to share my experience exploring San Diego on foot since I've been living here for the past few years. Trust me, walking around this beautiful city is one of the best ways to really soak in everything it has to offer.

Let me tell you about some of my favorite spots to walk around San Diego. First up is the Embarcadero - this waterfront promenade is absolutely stunning. You can watch massive cruise ships dock, check out the USS Midway Museum, and grab some fresh seafood at Seaport Village. The views of the bay are incredible, especially during sunset.

Balboa Park is another must-visit spot. It's basically San Diego's version of Central Park, but with way more Spanish architecture and museums. I love spending weekends here just wandering through the gardens, especially the Botanical Building (it's free!). There are street performers, food vendors, and always something interesting going on.

If you're into beaches (who isn't?), the La Jolla Coast Walk Trail is amazing. You can spot seals and sea lions lounging on the rocks, and the ocean views are spectacular. Speaking of beaches, the Mission Beach Boardwalk is perfect for people-watching and getting that classic Southern California vibe.

Little Italy is one of my favorite neighborhoods to explore. The streets are lined with amazing restaurants, cool boutiques, and on Saturdays, there's this awesome farmers market. The smell of fresh pizza and coffee is everywhere!

By the way, if you're planning a trip here and want to explore these spots (plus many more) with some insider knowledge, I've found some great guided tours through https://athometouch.com/SanDiego. They really know their stuff and show you places you might miss on your own.

Coronado Island is another gem - you can walk across the bridge if you're feeling adventurous (though I usually take the ferry). The historic Hotel del Coronado is gorgeous, and the beach there is consistently ranked among the best in the country.

Old Town is perfect if you want to experience San Diego's Mexican heritage. The streets are full of history, and you can find some of the best tacos in town here. Pro tip: visit during Dia de los Muertos - it's incredible!

For nature lovers, Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve offers amazing hiking trails with ocean views. Just remember to bring water and wear good shoes - some trails can be a bit challenging.

If you're interested in guided walking tours or want to discover more hidden spots, check out https://athometouch.com/SanDiego. They've got some really cool experiences that'll show you parts of the city most tourists never see.

Remember, San Diego's weather is pretty much perfect year-round, so there's never a bad time to explore on foot. Just bring sunscreen and comfortable shoes, and you're good to go!",1,1734337353.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

1hfelzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hfelzt/my_new_girlfriend_spends_a_lot_of_time_with_her_ex/,My new girlfriend  spends a lot of time with her ex. ,"My girlfriend (37f) and I (37m) have been dating for about 2 months. Neither of us have kids and our familys don’t live anywhere close to us. We’ve both been single a couple of months befor meeting. Shes freshly divorced after a 8year marriage. Myself after a 2 year relationship. She explained that the divorce was that there was no love and it was like living with a roommate. There was an instant connection between us when we met and things “just clicked” and it feels like we’ve known eachother our whole lives. I never believed in the idea of “love at first sight” before I met her. She lives about 30 minutes from me and is in the medical field, currently focusing on studying for a professional exam coming up in February. As a result we don’t get to see eachother often. It sucks but I understand that I’m fine with it since since we are both very independent people. About two weeks ago we went on our 3rd date, it was coffee for about an hour nothing crazy, we kissed and said goodnight. She asked me to be her boyfriend later that night. I was a bit surprised she asked given that in two months we’ve only seen eachother 3 times and hasn’t been physical at all outside of a sort kiss (despite me trying). We had made plans to see eachother about 6 times in between our first and third date but she has always cancelled the day of for various reasons. So her wanting to move forward was a surprise for me. 

We usually chat daily either text or phone call with an occasional voice message (when we’re driving or otherwise can’t text) or video message. This week she wouldn’t pick up her phone or talk to me at all. After about 3 days I hear from her via text and it Turns out she was with her ex husband because his mom is in the hospital. I felt betrayed by this and tried to talk to her about it but she either ignored me completely or changed the subject. With the only explanation is that “it’s her family” (her exact words) so to me that means that her ex husband is top priority and she’d rather concentrate on her past then any future with me. 

Given that the “that’s my family” is the only thing I can get out of her i decided to table it until she was ready to talk to me about it. This happened 4 days ago and havent spoken since. Yesterday we had an engagement party for one of my close friends that she bailed on (with no direct explanation why). 

Today i decided to try and talk to her and get the ball moving by asking her to have Christmas dinner we me. I thought this would be a given since her family lives in Puerto Rico and my family is either visiting in-laws or is out of state. She dodged the question all day until finally saying okay. When I asked what time and tried making plans she ignored me. I politely explained that we need to learn how to communicate because making plans to see eachother on a major holiday when we’d otherwise be alone shouldn’t be an all day activity (at least in my opinion). She agreed to talk to me about it but then I didn’t hear from her for about 3 hours. (I know it doesn’t like a long time but it was getting very late in the day at this point) I called her out for ignoring it (this is at 11pm she’s generally up until 1 or 2 am so I don’t think think it was a bad time) because generally speaking that’s what she’s done before in other situations instead of having a hard conversation. 

I got a snarky text right away (this is all via text because she hasn’t picked up the phone all week) about how she won’t respond to disrespect.

I don’t understand this. Why bother asking for a relationship if she doesn’t want to see me? It’s not like there was a ton of investment into us prior to it. And how is asking for communication disrespectful but she’ll spend all her free time with her ex husband? 

I’ve been played and used before (at this point in life I’m somewhat of an expert on shitty things people can do) but she hasn’t taken anything from me money or otherwise or even asked. I can't figure out how to communicate with this woman, we don't talk or see eachother. So I don’t see her motivation in wanting a relationship with me. 

Does anyone have any ideas? I really like this girl and she really hasn’t shown any red flags at all until now. I feel like the only outcome that doesn’t end in the relationship ended is me folding. Although i feel like I’ve been wronged. I think that she could be “the one” but this situation has me stumped. Am I the asshole in this? ",1,1734337344.0,AITAH,5,0.67,False
1hfelr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1hfelr2/4_days_post_ma_and_still_feeling_pregnancy/,4 days post MA and still feeling pregnancy symptoms,"I did my MA at 6 weeks and 6 days of GA, and it has been 5 days ever since. I'm really worried about it not being successful because I'm still feeling pregnant. My nausea and sensitive smell are already gone but I am experiencing lightheadedness. Everytime I do a small task, I get exhausted. It just feels like I wanna sleep, and it's been like this for 5 days. I feel like my head is floating and I get tired very easily. 

Is this even normal? 

To give you a background, I had a delayed start when I bled. It took me 8 hours to start the bleeding when I took miso. (I already took mife the day before) I passed blood clots but I can't guarantee that I saw a gray tissue or anything that resembles a fetus. I didn't know what to look out for. I just knew that I passed clots almost the size of my palm. 

After a day, I continued to bleed a little. Only a little. Like, 2-5 drops of blood in my pantyliner and it's color is of dark brown. Like a coffee. 

The most concerning thing is that I continue to experience lightheadedness and fatigue. Did the MA fail? Let me know what you think, please. I have so much doubts. 

And if ever it failed, can I redo the whole MA process? ",1,1734337311.0,abortion,1,1.0,False
1hfeli0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1hfeli0/the_hollowed_grin/,The Hollowed Grin,"I’ve always been fascinated by thrift stores. There’s something about the idea of owning a fragment of someone else’s life that makes the world feel bigger, more interconnected. That’s what drew me to the dusty box of VHS tapes in the corner of the store—unlabeled, some in cracked cases, others bare and smeared with what looked like dried coffee stains. For five bucks, I walked out with a stack of someone else’s forgotten memories.



Back at home, I dusted off my old VHS player and popped in the first tape. Static. The familiar hum of the machine filled my small living room. Then came the flicker of a home video: a birthday party, kids in the backyard, balloons swaying in the breeze. Harmless. Nostalgic. I smiled.  


But it was the third tape that changed everything.  


It started with static, like the others, but this time it lingered, crackling and stuttering as if the tape itself was resisting being played. Slowly, an image emerged. The footage was shaky, the kind of unstable handheld recording that makes you queasy if you watch too long. The camera appeared to be in a dimly lit basement. Concrete walls. Exposed pipes. And then, the mask.



At first, I couldn’t tell what I was looking at. The camera zoomed in and out erratically, as if the person holding it couldn’t decide what to focus on. But eventually, it settled. The mask dominated the frame: pale, almost yellowed with age, its surface cracked in places. The eyes were hollow black voids, and the mouth hung open in an expression that teetered between a scream and a laugh. It wasn’t just a prop; it felt alive.



The camera moved closer, revealing subtle details: scratches around the edges, dark stains on the inside. The operator’s breathing was audible now, uneven and shallow, like they were afraid to be too loud. A faint sound played in the background—a distant, rhythmic tapping, like footsteps echoing in a long corridor.



Then the mask moved.



It wasn’t much, just a slight tilt, but it was enough. I froze, the remote slipping from my hand. The camera jerked violently, as though the person filming had reacted the same way I did. The screen erupted into static again, but this time there were brief flashes of something else intercut with the noise: the mask’s empty eyes filling the screen, a quick glimpse of what looked like a hand reaching out, long fingers curled unnaturally. And then, words.



They were faint, almost imperceptible, but I heard them: “Play it again.”



The tape cut off abruptly. I sat there, heart pounding, staring at the blank screen. Against my better judgment, I rewound the tape and hit play. The footage was the same at first, but as I watched, I noticed things I hadn’t seen before. Shadows moving in the background. Whispers beneath the tapping sound. The mask’s mouth seemed wider now, its hollow grin stretching unnaturally. And then, a new shot appeared.



The camera was pointed at a doorway. Beyond it, darkness. The operator’s hand came into frame, trembling as it reached for the doorknob. They hesitated, their breathing growing more frantic. And then, just as their fingers brushed the metal, the door burst open.



Something lunged at the camera, and the screen went black.



I scrambled to eject the tape, my hands shaking. When I finally managed to pull it free, I noticed something I hadn’t before: etched into the plastic casing were the words, “It sees you.”



I’ve since tried to throw the tape away—more than once. Every time, it reappears, sitting on my coffee table as if it never left. I don’t play it anymore, but sometimes, late at night, I hear the faint sound of tapping coming from the direction of my TV.



The mask isn’t on the tape anymore.
