Everyone has a Sharla. She’s the kind of person who can’t stand the idea of you living your own life without her in it.

At first, she seemed harmless. Chatty. Maybe lonely. Then came the texts.
Paragraphs. Emotional essays about how I “hurt her feelings” if I didn’t reply fast enough. Apparently, friendship means being on call 24/7 like an unpaid therapist and an Uber driver.

She’d say things like, “It’s fine, I’ll just get an Uber… unless you change your mind.”
Then she’d tell me exactly how much the Uber cost — like I was supposed to Venmo her out of guilt.

Speaking of money, she once left cash under my trashcan instead of just using Cash App.
Who needs Venmo when you have raccoon-style drop-offs?

Then came the “gift.”
A random coffee mug and a sheet of Thanksgiving stickers.
I don’t drink coffee. And I’m not five.
But hey, it’s the thought that counts… I think.

The final straw? She started showing up unannounced, saying:

“Muffin told me he wanted to see you.”

Muffin is her dog.
Apparently he’s clairvoyant now.

After one too many guilt-trippy texts accusing me of not being a “real friend,” I finally said,
“Don’t bother me again. You just met the INFJ door slam.”

Haven’t heard from her since. Muffin probably didn’t authorize that either.

⸻

TL;DR: My neighbor thinks emotional manipulation and surprise visits are friendship. Her dog apparently agrees.

1o488wi,https://i.redd.it/vkoq98f73kuf1.jpeg,My First Espresso Setup: HiBREW H10B + G5 [280€ total],"Hey everyone,

This is my first coffee setup, a HiBREW H10B espresso machine paired with the HiBREW G5 grinder.
It’s definitely not high-end, but with some practice and trial and error, I’ve been able to pull some really good shots.

Sometimes I struggle with clogging or choking, even though I use the same dose and grind size that worked perfectly before.
Not sure why that happens yet, but I’d really appreciate any hints or tips from you to help me figure it out.

What do you think about this setup?
From my point of view, it’s actually perfect for the price (~280€ total), solid performance once dialed in.

He quickly got into a new relationship and I found out the type of man he is from a mutual friend. He is an abuser, manipulator, cheater, pathological liar, alcoholic, and a drug abuser. Most of his friends have stopped talking and hanging out with him, he’s banned from certain places because people know about him and his behaviour. He’s even going to therapy now with his current girlfriend (2 months together btw). Even with me knowing this, I thought I’d get over him quicker. Whilst it made things a bit easier when receiving the news, I’m stuck back again.

We’re both back at university and I’ve been seeing him around much more now. I even spotted him looking at me last week when we were walking past each other across the street. Every time I’ve seen him, I still feel something, both anger and I still have feelings for him. It doesn’t help that he’s been actually taking care of himself and looks better. It’s making me angry seeing him around and I catch myself staring at him and replaying all our memories, how we’d hug each other every time we had our breaks and go to classes together, but now I have to avoid him.

What doesn’t help me more is that despite him being such an awful person, he has all the traits I want in a partner. He loved playing games with me, his quirky and nerdy interests, we both are in a specific music scene and have similar taste in music, same humour, both autistic, and so on.. I just keep romanticising him again. I lay in bed and wish he was still cuddling me or us watching our shows together, him giving me coffee and food without me asking.

Why did he have to turn out to be who he is? And why do I still have to see him?

How can two people who had a connection and such intimate moments and memories now not look at one another anymore? They have to be ignored.

My heart hurts as I type this. I’ve been checking on his profiles even more now even though we removed each other on most places just because I see him around more. This is not fair. He’s not thinking about me at all and we both have more important things to focus on but right now all I can think about is him and it’s affecting me massively. 

Even today, I saw the girl he cheated with when with me and all of his friends asking about him. I almost cried. He would usually be with me and we’d talk to his friends but now it’s me alone talking about him because nobody has seen him in a while. This is so hard.",1,1760220412.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1o482i4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o482i4,Before and after fireplace,"This work was done a while ago now, but I’m still super proud of it and it’s now really hard to imagine the room without it, it was hella hard work. 

First the original 60’s tile fireplace and hearth was ripped out, then the back boiler (I cannot describe just how heavy that little thing was!), the new solid stone hearth stones were installed and the 4 top stones… there’s a story behind this whole fire surround:

****
I wanted solid stone so as not to risk combustion as we were going to be installing a multi fuel burner, so I looked around and found one on eBay with a 99p start, it’d been removed from a cottage renovation and I was up against one other seller and won for about £70, the whole surround was literally black all over with soot from its use and required a hell of a lot of cleaning. It weighed a ton too and our big car nigh on rode the wheel arches on  the way back 😳😬

As the mantle stone was in 2 pieces I called a stone mason to come out to repair it as it was a very clean break and happened during its removal from the cottage apparently. By this time I’d cleaned up the stones and there was pink heat staining on the hearth stones. The mason told us that would’ve been where the original firebox would’ve sat on the stones and showed us the outline shape created on them. 

He said the mantle stone was such a clean break that he could compound a ‘glue’ to hold it and match its colour to other veins in the other stones, he nearly dropped his coffee after he’d asked us how much we’d paid for the surround 😅 and said how much it should’ve cost 😳

****
After fitting it and lots of heavy duty strapping to the wall, it was time to render the inside with Bath stone cement I think it was, I know that 2 tiny little bags of that cost almost as much as the fire surround had if not more, it was used everywhere visible in the gaps, I can’t remember what the stones were bedded on top of whether it was that or standard grey cement 🤷

After the rendering was complete, and base tiles down, we had the stove professionally installed (about £1.5-2k I think as they ran a lining as well up the chimney)

Initially the mantle stone was a teensy bit wider than the chimney breast, but we had plans for when we decorated and installed shallow boxing on both sides and hid that gap a treat, it also hides the wiring for the sockets on the side which houses the defunct fireplace for the kitchen (it’s technically a double sided chimney leading to 2 separate outlets on the roof), the wall warms up when the fire is on so I’m glad we checked this step tbh

When we purchased this house it was definitely a fixer upper and I have to say this is the most satisfying thing we’ve achieved as it now imo looks like it’s always been there, fact it’s recycled so has knocks, chips and that aforementioned pink stain adds to its charm I think 

Btw we change the fire cement on the stack every year so we have assurance of a good seal, but gave up painting the cement years ago 😅🤭",2,1760220021.0,DIYUK,0,1.0,False

I put a ton of thought into my kiddos for gifts and really anyone I'm buying for. Her birthday presents are separate from Christmas. 

To preface before anyone comments. Yes my kid (other one is too young to understand) understands the true meaning behind christmas. 

We don't buy gifts throughout the year. Of course clothing yes and some books and necessities. 

So let's get into it. 
She likes... 
Softball
She wrestles too
Really likes the fantastic mr fox
Animals (too many stuffies lol)
Crafts 
Reading 
Harry potter
AC/DC,the offspring
Stitch
Flowers 
Smelly stuff


We got her so far

(Softball) hurricane category four Batting trainer (plan on getting her Batting gloves she's been asking for) 
A Softball ""I am... sign""

(Fantastic mr fox) got her this metal antique bookmark for her stocking with a fox that kind of looks like the same fox) 

Harry potter lego car (she freaked over at the store)
Harry potter coffee mug with changing hot cocoa set
AC/DC shirt 
Flowery shirt she saw before and asked for but didn't have her size. Now they did
Goosebumps 10 book series (she keeps telling me she would love to get to read them) plus a Spiderwick book
Cat camper lego car 
Furblet (as of today she's been asking for them. She has one but really wants the cotton candy one as well. Plus they interact so I plan on getting a 2nd one) 
Magnetic USA map puzzle (she has a gift of memorizing different countries within minutes.) 
Stepping stone kit to make and mold. She's been asking for months 
Paint by sticker book
I made her a flower quilt (hexagon flowers with her favorite. Butterflies and I sewed on lady bugs- also her favorite) 
Making her a Harry potter rice bag
A small clay bead set

When you read it, it sounds like a lot. When you look at it, it doesn't look like much. Most things were small gift in size. I'd feel bad during Christmas morning when she sees her brothers gifts. He's 2. She's a kid. Even though she's a very grateful kid, she's a kid. 

One of the gifts I got for our 2 year old is something she asked for. I just read on her list she wants an RC snake. Our son has a large robo live snake for Christmas. But it's not rc but it does slither. 

Again, she's a very grateful kid. She says, ""it's not about gifts. It's Jesus' birthday and that's what we are celebrating "" and asked for flower socks she got last year. 

Any other ideas?

Cora
The night is busier than usual, and I've run myself ragged trying to keep up in the ER. As a nurse, I don't normally work the ER, but I've had trauma training, and when three nurses called off, I came in. The overtime will be a nice bonus. I'm behind on my rent, and I hope this extra money will help me not only catch up on that, but on the other bills as well.
""Cora!""
I glance up from my charts to see Mrs. Hesh, my supervisor in the ER, hurrying toward me. She looks panicked.
""What's wrong?""
""We have several VIP patients coming in. I need your help.""
""Of course."" I close the chart and put it back in the pile I still need to go through. ""What do I need to know?""
""Several of the hockey players from the Raptors got injured and are being rushed here. We need to make sure they're taken care of straight away and that the team and coaches are kept informed of their status. Can you do that?""
""Shouldn't Shelia do that? She's the senior RN. I'm only filling in."" Hockey players make me uneasy. Bad past experience.
""I don't trust her not to ask them all for autographs. She's a total fangirl.""
My eyes widen. I didn't know Mrs. H. knew what that term even meant.
""And I heard you say you knew hockey.""
""I do.""
""Good. I trust you not to lose your mind when confronted by the team.""
""No, ma'am, I won't.""
""You may need to wrangle some of the other nurses, too. I'll be busy with the patients.""
""They're not going to like it, especially the ones who have seniority over me.""
""Does that mean you can't do it?"" The older woman turns and looks me dead in the eye, hers shrewd and assessing.
But she can change my status here at the hospital. I'm not going to do anything to disappoint her. It says a lot she's trusting me with this.
""I can do it.""
""Good.""
We both rush to the ER entrance, waiting for the ambulances to arrive. I pull my ponytail down and redo it, tucking the loose strands of my heavy blonde hair behind my ear. I learned during my first real rotation to always keep my hair up and out of the way. Otherwise, you could get run over in a packed ER because you can't see when your hair is swinging everywhere.
It only takes a few moments for the first two ambulances to come screeching into the ER entrance, sirens blaring. Taking a deep breath, I close my eyes for two seconds then move forward, meeting the ambulance doors and waiting for them to open. The first player out is Jamison O'Brian. He has a nasty cut to the face, and his leg is propped up and held immobile by the board strapped to it. He looks rough, but not in danger.
Dr. Billings waves him off with the nurse standing behind me. I don't remember the guy's name. I'm not down here enough to know everyone. The second ambulance holds a more serious injury. Myers is the name emblazoned on his jersey. His head is a bloody mess, as is his arm, a nasty looking gash that was most likely caused by a blade. That's going to keep him out for a couple of weeks at least, depending on any kind of nerve or muscle damage.
He goes with Ava, the other nurse down here from my regular floor. Ava and I are friends, and we both frown at the seriousness of the injury. Ava is a huge hockey fan, but she can be trusted not to lose her mind over treating a player, which is why she's been called out to meet the ambulances.
The last ambulance is the one Mrs. H. seems the most concerned with. As soon as the doors spring open and the EMTs start shouting stats, I get a good look at the unconscious man lying prone and bleeding on the stretcher.
All the air rushes out of my lungs, and all I can do is stare.
No. It can't be.
He's in Florida.
Not Minnesota.
""Cora?"" The sharp tone snaps me out of my funk.
""Sorry. It's just I know him.""
""You know him?""
We run after the stretcher.
""I went to school with him.""
""Is this going to be a problem?""
""No, ma'am. I was just shocked is all. I hadn't realized he'd been traded to the Raptors. I'm good.""
She nods and we get to work, me helping cut his clothes off, revealing the extent of his injuries. He has massive bruises on his abdomen, which might indicate internal bleeding. There's also a nasty cut along one thigh, and his shoulder is at an odd angle.
The doctors twist it back into its socket while he's unconscious. I wince when they do, glad he's unconscious for that. Resetting a shoulder is extremely painful. As the doctors do that, we keep working, helping to clean away the mess so they can evaluate him. The bleeding is stopped, and then he's gone to CT to make sure there was no damage to the brain and to see if he has internal bleeding where the bruising is.
I go to check on the next patient, who is currently complaining that he's fine and he doesn't need all the fuss.
The doctor and the male nurse are disagreeing with him, but he just gets louder. They do not know how to deal with hockey players, apparently. Or they don't want to upset a VIP patient. Either way, the patient's care comes first, even when said patient is acting like a big baby.
""Sit."" My tone is sharp and commanding when he tries to get off the table. His brown eyes snap to mine, and I just arch a brow.
""I'm fine."" He stands up, daring me to say a word. He has no idea he's dealing with someone who grew up around hockey players.
""You are not fine. Now, sit down before you fall down.""
The nurse and doctor look at me like I've grown two heads, but O'Brian sits, a scowl on his face. He might terrify everyone else with that look, but not me.
""Don't give me that look. Your leg could be broken, and the more you stand on it, the more damage you'll be doing. Which means longer time off the ice. So stop being a whiney prick and let us take care of you so you can get back out there.""
""Fine,"" he mutters, and I shake my head. Hockey players.
Mrs. H. stands to the side, a small smile on her face. ""Cora, we need you in here, please.""
I peel my gloves off and don a new pair when I push into the room where Myers sits, growling at everyone. The nurses are all a little too giddy and not really doing their job. Sighing, I push through them, snapping for them to get to work or get out.
The low chuckle from the bed catches my attention, and I arch that same brow. ""That's a nasty cut, Mr. Myers.""
""I've had worse."" Dark green eyes dance with mischief even with the twinge of pain in them.
""I'm sure you have."" Ava hustles over, looking exasperated. ""Thanks for that. They weren't listening to me.""
""No problem."" Between the two of us, we get him stripped and cleaned, working around the doctors and getting them what they need as well. Soon he's hustled off to x-ray, and Ava and I take a moment to catch our breath.
""That was intense.""
""I forget how surly they can be when they're hurt.""
""Your stepfather was a high school coach, wasn't he?""
I nod, not really paying attention.
""So that's how you know so much about hockey.""
We both jump at the sound of Mrs. H.'s voice. ""Sorry, we just needed a moment.""
""Understandable. Cora if you can go inform the team of what's going on, I'd appreciate it. They're camped out in the waiting room.""
""And being very loud, I take it?""
Her lips twitch, and I know I'm right.
Sighing, I push off the wall and take a glance at the charts before walking down the hall to the waiting room.
I hear the noise before I even reach the doors. Loud isn't quite the word I'd use. Think of about thirty two-year-olds all screaming at the top of their lungs. That would be the most accurate picture of the noise coming from out there.
No fewer than six nurses, male and female alike, are trying to talk above the noise. But honestly, they're not asking about injuries or informing the team about the patients. They're talking about the game.
""Excuse me."" I make myself louder than normal, but it's not doing a thing to get anyone attention.
So I do the one thing I know will get through. I put fingers to my lips and let out a whistle so shrill it hurts the ears. Another thing left over from my high school days. A little trick my stepfather taught me.
But it's effective, and every single bit of noise dies down.
""Thank you. Now, where is the head coach?""
He stands and walks forward. ""I'm Coach Baptist.""
""All three of your players are being taken care of. O'Brian's in x-ray, and Myers and Chandler are upstairs in CT. They're checking for head trauma and internal bleeding. As soon as we know more, I'll come out and let you know."" I turn my attention back to the nurses. ""You lot have things to do other than stand around out here and gossip. Get back to work.""
""I outrank you."" The snottiest of them grins.
""Yes, but Mrs. H. put me in charge. Sure you want to tell her why you decided to pull that snarky little comment out of your a$s?""
Her eyes widen, and she turns and marches back through the doors. Idiot.
""Well, what are the rest of you waiting for?""
They grumble but shuffle off.
Which leaves the team to deal with.
""Is there anyone else out here who needs medical attention?""
A collective shake of heads is the only answer.
""Now, I know you're all tired, and anxious to find out about your teammates, but this is a hospital. There are sick people here, and all this noise isn't helping.""
More grumbling.
""I get it, guys, I do, but I swear if you don't settle down, you're going to deal with me, and trust me, ladder drills have nothing on my ire, so please do us all a favor and behave.""
""Ladder drills, huh?"" one player asks. ""You know hockey?""
""Yes. Now, unless you guys need something, I'll be back when I have more to report.""
I turn around, and a wolf whistle follows me.
It takes me two seconds to have the offender's ear in between my fingers. You'd be amazed at how quickly a man will come to heel with a little pressure on his earlobe.
""Ow!"" he screeches.
""I'm not your honey, babe, or a bunny. I'm Nurse Stevens, and if you disrespect me again, I will have your balls. Understand?""
""Yes, ma'am.""
I turn him loose and give them all a level stare. ""Understand?""
A chorus of ""yes, ma'ams"" follow me as I turn around and disappear behind the doors leadings back to the ER.
Hockey players.

Cora
Has it really been only four hours since the worst shock of my life? But my trusty watch says it has. Thank God for all my training, or I might have run from the hospital and never come back.
Shaw Chandler.
Dear sweet baby Jesus.
I never expected to see him again, especially not in Minnesota, of all places. He swore he never wanted to play where it was cold ever again. The southern states or the warmer ones on the west coast are where he wanted to play. It's why I felt so safe moving here. Even though hockey is king in this state the same way football is in Texas, I knew he'd never play here.
But then, players don't dictate trades.
He might not have been given a choice.
And besides, it's not like he'd care I'm here, anyway.
We haven't spoken in over four years.
Shaking my head, I pull myself together and focus on the patient who needs the nausea meds. Poor man seems to have gotten food poisoning. He's thrown up three times since he got here twenty minutes ago. He's dehydrated, but the IV I put in with the fluids should start to help soon.
""Here you go, Mr. Croom. This will ease the nausea."" I hand him the tablets and small paper cup. He takes it and swallows the pills down.
""God, I hope this stays down.""
Me too. He threw up on me earlier.
Glancing at the clock, a sigh escapes when I see my shift is over. I can go home and forget I saw Shaw Chandler.
But the pale stillness of him when he came in worries me. Shaw was my best friend all throughout school, and as much as he hurt me, part of me still worries about him. I always will.
""I'm getting ready to leave, Mr. Croom, but Amber will be the charge nurse on duty. She should be by in just a few minutes. Is there anything you need before I go?""
He shakes his head miserably, and I smile encouragingly at him. Food poisoning is one of the worst things in the world.
""Hey, Cora.""
Amber shoots me a smile when I walk over to the nurses' station to clock out on the computer.
""Watch that one. He's got food poisoning and has already thrown up on me.""
""Ouch.""
I wrinkle my nose. I smell like vomit, but at least I have on clean scrubs. I learned early on to keep several extra sets on hand.
I give her the rundown on the rest of the patients as I gather my things.
""I heard about the hockey mess that came in.""
""Yeah. Two serious injuries and one very loud, very vocal team.""
""We've had them in a few times over the years. Takes some wrangling.""
""I handled it.""
""I knew you could."" She waves me off as I walk around the station. ""See you tomorrow!""
No, she won't, but I don't bother mentioning that. Amber is one of the nicest people in this place, and I try not to let my snarky nature disrupt her bubbly attitude.
It's not until I'm in the elevator stepping off onto the floor where Shaw is that I realize I've even done it. I shouldn't be here. I know it, but I'm worried.
He looked so pale.
Groaning at my own gluttony for punishment, I walk down the hall to his room. No one is around. He's probably still passed out. He had a nasty concussion, but because of the surgery to repair his spleen, he had to have anesthesia. If I remember correctly, he doesn't respond well to the stuff. It knocks him out for days afterward, so I should be good just to sneak in and check to make sure he's okay.
But he's not alone. One of the nurses from the waiting room is standing there, taking photos on his phone.
What the...
""Just what the heck do you think you're doing?""
He whirls around, and his eyes go round.
I whip out my phone and text Mrs. H. She's the one nurse I know who will take care of this.
""What are you doing?"" he asks, voice low.
""Texting my supervisor to let her know what you're doing.""
He looks from the phone to me and then shrugs. He knows he can sell those photos for a few hundred thousand, easy. It's no biggie if he gets fired. He breezes by me and out the door.
Oh, he did not!
Running after him, I catch his arm and pull him around. ""You're not...""
""Don't make me hurt you, babe."" His tone is threatening, but it doesn't register. All I'm thinking about is those photos.
Photos of Shaw when he's vulnerable and unable to defend himself.
""You are not getting out of here with those pictures.""
""You going to stop me, babe?""
Without thinking, I grab his phone and slam it on the ground, smashing it in the process. Well, cracking the screen more than the phone flying into little bits and pieces.
""You little bimbo!""
And before I can dodge, his fist has connects with my face.
Everyone on the floor sees it.
He seems to notice and tries to run, but one of the hockey guys from downstairs is only a few steps away and snags him.
""You okay, Cora?"" Natalee, one of my good friends, asks as she helps me up. ""Did you hit your head?""
The pain vibrating across my cheek is horrible. The bruise is going to be epically bad. My head does hurt, but it's not as bad as the cheek.
""She broke my phone!"" the offender shouts.
""That doesn't give you the right to hit a girl, dude."" Mr. Tall Dark and Deadly hockey player doesn't look impressed with the nurse's outburst.
Mrs. H. arrives and, seeing my face, rushes over to check it, her fingers gentle on my jaw. ""This needs x-rayed.""
""It'll be fine."" I can't afford a hospital bill. Even with our insurance taking care of most of the bill, I still can't afford what would be left.
""No, it won't,"" she rebukes. ""Or do I need to pull the same spiel you gave earlier?""
I try to smile, but it hurts too much.
""Now, is this the man you texted about?""
I nod. ""Yes, ma'am. He was taking pictures of Sha...Mr. Chandler. When he tried to run, I smashed his phone. I'm sorry about that, but it's the only thing I could think to do. Our job is to take care of our patients, not exploit them when they're unconscious.""
""He did what?"" The voice of the player holding the nurse drops two octaves and turns from soft to hard so fast it would make your head spin. Even those pretty brown eyes have gone so cold and dark, they're nearly black.
""She's lying!""
""I don't think so."" Mrs. H. collects the smashed phone off the floor. ""The police should be able to pull any photos from the phone. It's not damaged too badly.""
The man's face pales.
""We'll take care of this."" Mrs. H. turns to Natalee. ""Get her checked in then off to x-ray. Someone will be by to fill out an incident report, and Cora, don't worry about the bill. You won't be getting one since it's a work-related injury.""
Her expression dares me to argue, so instead I pull out my own phone and text my babysitter that I'll be later than I thought. At least I don't have to worry about one more bill I can't afford.
When I get back from x-ray, they don't take me down to the ER like I expected. They bring me back to Shaw's floor and to a room.
Natalee winks when she comes in. ""Can't have one of ours down there in the mess.""
I smile gratefully, knowing she pulled a few strings. This is my normal floor, and I love the nurses I work with up here.
""You got some ninja skills, girlfriend.""
""Ha, if I had skills, I wouldn't have gotten hit.""
""Yeah, I didn't see that coming either. I was already up and coming over when you snatched Marty's phone, but I wasn't able to stop him. Sorry.""
I wave off her apology. ""How much longer do you think this is going to be? Noah's already up and probably mad that I'm not there to make his breakfast.""
""How is the kiddo?""
""He's good, adjusting better than I thought he would when we moved out here.""
""It had to be hard on him. When John and I moved here two years ago, our daughter declared us horrible people and said she'd never forgive us.""
""How'd that go?""
""She was five. She got over it when we took her ice skating.""
I laugh and then wince. ""Don't make me laugh. It hurts.""
""Sorry."" She hands me the cup of coffee she'd been holding. ""I brought this for you. It's from the stand outside, not the cafeteria. Thought you'd need some caffeine.""
""Thanks, Nat.""
""Anytime. I have to go check on patients, but the doctor shouldn't be too long. He has to haul it up from the ER, so...""
I shrug. It'll probably be a while longer than she let on. I'll drink my coffee and try not to focus on the man a few doors down from me.
The one I shouldn't even have checked on.
But I'm glad I did. No matter what happened between Shaw and me, no one deserves to have their photo taken while they're at their most vulnerable. Especially not by the people who are supposed to be taking care of them.
""Knock, knock."" The hockey player who snagged the nurse walks in. ""that looks bad.""
""I'd say it looks worse than it feels, but I'd be lying.""
He comes closer, his hands in his pockets. His black hoodie with the Raptors logo isn't nearly as dark as his hair. The stubble on his face gives him a rakish look. He reminds me of a pirate and is way hotter than Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean. The man is gorgeous, and he knows it. It's the way he moves, the confidence of his stride.
I take a sip of my coffee, careful to blow on it first.
""That's not from the cafeteria.""
""Nope. There's a little coffee vendor outside the hospital. Better than Starbucks.""
""No sh-it?""
""No sh-it.""
""Good to know.""
After he stands there awkwardly for a full minute, I decide to put him out of his misery. ""Is there anything I can help you with?""
""Oh...uh...I just wanted to check on you, make sure you were okay."" He doesn't sound nearly as confident as his stride. He sounds nervous.
""I'm good.""
""And to thank you for what you did.""
""Not necessary. I'm sorry it happened. I didn't think anyone here would do something like that.""
""You'd be surprised at what people will do for money."" The darkness lurking in his eyes tells me that he's well acquainted with the subject.
Another minute goes by, and then his phone buzzes. He pulls it out and frowns at the message.
""Everything okay?""
He sighs. ""My kid has terrorized another nanny. She's threatening to quit.""
Now that, I smile at. ""My son went through three sitters when we moved here six months ago. He was adjusting to a new place, a new city, and sitters he didn't know.""
""My son has lived here his whole life, which is all of four years. He loves to cause chaos, and the nannies I hire don't like the chaos. I wish he was more like his sister. She's as sweet as can be.""
I laugh at that, not caring about the wince. ""Three- and four-year-old little boys are a handful and take a certain brand of crazy to deal with all its own.""
""That they do."" He smiles, and it lights up his entire face. ""I'm Blaine Kirkos, by the way.""
""Nice to meet you, Mr...""
He's shaking his head, interrupting me before I can get the word out. ""No mister. Call me Blaine. We parents have to stick together. At least now I know how you handled a room full of hockey players and wrangled Myers and O'Brian. They said you were like a little general, daring them to disobey you.""
""Hockey players are very much like little boys.""
""I'm not saying I agree, but...""
""But you do.""
His smile is my only answer.
""So, I was thinking I could get you tickets to a game or something...to say thank you for taking care of everyone and stopping that guy from getting away with photos.""
""Oh, no, that's okay. You don't have to do that.""
""But I want to.""
""I work most nights you guys have games.""
""You could switch a shift or call in...""
""Can't call in. Bills to pay and all that.""
""How about I send you tickets, and if you can come, then you come?""
I start to tell him thank you but no when the doctor comes in. He glances at Blaine and does a double take. ""Oh, Mr. Kirkos, I didn't know you knew Cora.""
He winks at me and shakes the doctor's hand. ""Just in here checking on our favorite nurse. I'll let you talk to her so she can get out of here and home to her son. I'll be seeing you Nurse Stevens!""
He walks out whistling, and the doctor turns to me, one eyebrow raised. I refrain from saying a word, and when he realizes I'm not about to gossip, he gets down to business. My cheekbone is not fractured as they'd feared, but it's going to hurt like crazy. He offers pain meds, and I decline, so he writes me a prescription for Ibuprofen 800 and calls it a day.
Once my discharge papers are firmly in hand, I tell Natalee goodbye and waver in front of Shaw's door. Giving in to temptation, I go in and walk over to the bed.
He's just as gorgeous as I remember. His skin is darker, pecked by the Florida sun. The blond hair that always made him look like the boy next door is lighter, sun bleached from days spent on the beach. His eyes are a dark stormy gray, and even though they're closed, I can picture them. His body has filled out a lot since the last time I saw him. He's become the man that the boy only hinted at.
""Hey...""
I turn to see Natalee come in. She's got questions in her eyes, but I shrug, not up to answering them.
""How is he?"" I ask instead.
""In and out of consciousness, which is good, especially with the concussion. Surgery was successful, but he's not going to be on the ice anytime soon. Nasty concussion.""
I nod. It's what I assumed when they started talking about concussions in the ER. At least he's okay. I can go home and forget about him now.
""Tinkerbell?""
The hoarsely whispered word pulls my attention to pain-filled eyes. He's staring at me with an intensity that's hard to shake.
But I have to.
Without a word, I turn and walk out of the room.",1,1760219462.0,whatsthatbook,0,1.0,False

We've been having the same fight for years and I feel like an idiot thinking things will change. 

Here's how the cycle goes: a small task, chore, date etc gets missed or not done correctly. Instead of saying something like ""hey, I noticed you didn't take care of the recycling yesterday, could you please take care it?""

Her way of showing her frustration is to ignore me, be distant, short replies, extreme attitude, eye rolling etc. 

I express that I don't deserve to be treated this way for any reason, let alone something as simple as some crumbs on the coffee table. 

She digs in and is so focused on explaining WHY she is upset and how she is feeling but completely neglects taking accountability or showing remorse for initial reaction. More often than not I apologize for forgetting or missing something, no matter how small it is but I do take offense with how it is communicated to me. 

For context, she works from home most days and has the house to herself literally everyday. I work a very physically and mentally taxing job and am usually gone for around 12 hours a day. I leave at 7am and usually get home arrive 630pm. I do most of the cooking and grocery shopping. I clean, do dishes, take care of our animals, take out trash and recycling and more. I think I do way more than my share of chores, especially considering the amount of time I get to be at home. 

Yet, somehow I'm just not doing enough and these fights keep occurring ad nauseum. One time I forgot to scoop the cat litter during a business trip of hers.  I DID, however, tidy up the entire apartment, cook dinner, had music playing, candles lit etc. but when she saw the cat litter not done, instant attitude and an eye roll. 

One time I forgot to bring the recycling bin to the curb. 

One time, after cleaning the whole apartment before her return from a business trip, I had the audacity to forget to buy eggs. 

See a pattern?  I'm human, I can be forgetful at times but I don't deserve to be treated this way. Even after coming home from work, I'm usually the one to cook dinner, make her a decaf latte, and help with dishes afterwards. I get maybe an hour or two at the end of the day to sit relax. 

Don't get me wrong, she's incredibly tidy, does the chores, keeps track of our bills/appts etc. So I'm not claiming she is not doing her part. I am just struggling to be at the level she seems to have created in her head. I feel disrespected and taken for granted every time I make a small mistake. Her response is that they aren't small mistakes and she had the right to be angry. 

Everyone has the right to be angry but we still have a responsibility to communicate that in an effective and respectful manner.

We went to couples therapy for the first time few days ago (my suggestion) and felt we had a productive session. Literally two days later(today), we got into a huge fight because we missed our dog's grooming appointment. She was supposed to take him to the appointment but couldn't get home in time. She sends me ONE text, asking if I could take care of it, 45 minutes before the appointment. I didn't read the text until it was too late. She called me on the phone with extreme attitude asking why I wasn't able to and told her I didn't see the text until just now. Sensing she was angry I say ""okay, we can talk about this later when you get home"" and she hangs up. She claims she said ""bye"" but I didn't hear it. Even if she did, it was the quickest bye in the history of phone calls and we always say I love you before ending our calls. It was extremely obvious that she was upset and acting out.

I just don't know what to do. Our relationship is great otherwise. We just keep having these fights over and over. I've expressed my feelings of ending the relationship or taking time apart which she vehemently disagrees with and wants to work on our relationship. Constantly tells me I'm the greatest guy she's ever met etc.

Earlier this year I was working in a job where myself and the store manager were the only members of management. It was quite apparent that there was some favouritism towards me but I thought that was just because I was his only support management wise. The main things that have raised red flags for me since leaving that job is that there were a couple of frontline members of staff who the manager told me I should stay away from or said I shouldn’t trust them and gave me no real explanation other than “they’re poison”. When he noticed I wasn’t taking my breaks (too much work, not enough time, too many expectations from management higher than him etc) he would frequently make or buy me coffees, buy small cakes or chocolate bars and energy drinks and we’d eat the cakes and stuff together in the office or break room while he’d usually vent any work stress or tell me about his family. He made it feel like a privilege and said things like “you get the most time with me some bosses don’t even speak to their colleagues”. On a few occasions when I was learning to drive he asked if I wanted to drive his car. I won’t go into too much detail detail but there were quite a few things he was doing at work that he shouldn’t have been but I never felt like I could say anything to anyone because I was going through some personal stuff at the time that he was aware of and looking back on it I think I felt that if I said something chances are he would’ve been fired and I thought another manager wouldn’t put up with me bringing anything personal to them. For context in case it’s at all relevant, I’m a young woman, he’s double my age and this was my first job so when I got promoted to the managerial role I thought most of these behaviours were normal, unprofessional definitely but other than that I didn’t think there was anything wrong. Since leaving the company a few months ago I’m wondering if I was groomed but that’s a strong word so for anyone who knows a bit more about it than I do, I’d be grateful for some closure. I can’t do anything about it other than accept that it’s happened but maybe that’s a step forward.",2,1760219200.0,groomingvictim,0,1.0,False

1o47pji,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1o47pji/even_my_51m_separation_from_my_wife_48f_is/,Even my [51M] separation from my wife [48F] is complicated.,"Punchline: For reasons and finances, we've begun a separation within the same house. It's a step in the right direction, I suppose, but I can't compartmentalize the downshift as well as she seems to be able to. Technically a positive progress post. After being stuck for so long, any progress is probably good.

I have received all the answers from her I think I will ever get. Turns out that for all the prodding to get me assessed for the same, *she's* autistic. She just masks really well. This explains so much. The binary thinking, the rigid personal sense of morality, the railroading in conversations, the feeling like I'm constantly bridging the empathy and communication gap when she doesn't understand something. 

She admits to being demi-sexual. Simply no sexual thoughts about anyone outside of our relationship – something I cannot fathom, and only me when she's in the mood. ""Responsive desire"" it's sometimes called. My antidepressants have wrecked my libido, so that hasn't been a big deal for a couple of years, anyway. Certainly not an issue any more!

I'm still the sole earner in the household. I also just bought the family the house we're living in a few months ago. Actually part of the plan to get the family stable before the inevitable divorce, believe it or not. Now hers and the kids, I suppose. My finances are such that it will be difficult for me to scrape together enough to move out, but I've cancelled all entertainment subscriptions and started buying myself the cheap coffee, so I should be able to save up enough in a little while. 

My strategy for moving forward? I know that being petty doesn't serve any purpose, and I know that I will never get the satisfaction I crave for ""being right"". (Someone here called it ""chasing the *Why*"".) I still admire many things about her, so when she approaches me with annoyance or frustration, I will identify the core value that is motivating her question or concern and observe that I appreciate and admire that value. I recognize that this could be interpreted as sarcastic or cynical, but I think that it'll be more constructive to focus on what I admire about her rather than any perceived frustration. If I talk about my frustrations, it only gets turned back around at me anyway, so there's just no point engaging on that level. 

Will I ever be in another intimate relationship again? Maybe. Don't plan to go looking. Working on finding a therapist and getting some of the cobwebs blown out of my brain. This is the main short-term goal right now. 

I have written down a prediction about what I think *her* future relationship will look like. I already know the guy, she just gushes about him whenever they get together, his kids have moved out, he's been married for a long time, he's rich, handsome, has a great career... I think that things will start moving when he finds out that we're split up. We'll see.

I don't know if it gets better. Like I said, I'm struggling compartmentalizing this new phase of living separated in the same house. It kind of sucks, honestly. This person used to be my friend, and now she barely tolerates any interaction with me. It's hard not to fall into those old patterns and habits of kindness. She seems to have flipped the switch on me, though. However, this is a talent of her brain, not mine. 

It's difficult to accept the dissolution of my marriage without taking it as a personal failure. I know relationships end, and I know mine was well overdue to end, but over a lifetime of not ""living up to my potential"" or generally not feeling good enough, worthy enough, a second divorce, even after 25 years, still *feels* like failure.

A wise person on this very forum once told me, ""Happily married people don't get divorced."" Too true. 

Closing with the reminder that there's only one person responsible for your emotions, and that's you. Take care, y'all. I hope every one of you finds not necessarily what you're looking for, but what you need.",3,1760219082.0,DeadBedrooms,1,1.0,False

1o47o54,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o47o54,reading Welcome to the Hyunam-dong Bookshop by Hwang Bo-reum (2023),"This book caught my eye at my local independent bookshop and it was such a breath of fresh air. A multitude of diverse characters cover so many relevant topics: work, burnout, relationships, marriage, familial expectations, parenting, introspection, uncertainty, self-honesty, seeking refuge, finding peace, learning how to live.  
  
I'd recommend this book to anyone who feels stuck or would enjoy an easy read that is calm, poignant, and comforting.  
  
Some of my favorite lines from it:  
>""Isn't that what life is about? Forging forward with the answer you have - stumbling along the way and picking yourself up - only to one day realize that the answer you've held on to for a long time is not the right one. When that happens, it's time to look for the next answer. That's how ordinary folks, like herself, live. Over our life span, the right answer will keep changing.""  
>*pg. 20*  
  
>""After all, those steeped in loneliness could sometimes appear gruff and unfriendly.""  
>*pg. 37*  
  
>""In the process of figuring out his preferences, he had a vague realization that, perhaps, spending time on a single thing was like looking deep into himself.""   
>*pg. 63*  
  
>""We should learn to think well of ourselves.""  
>*pg. 105*  
  
>""It was an uncivil society, and that toxic behavior filtered downwards. Many colleagues put up a kind of front while stepping on others to climb upwards. Those who weren't part of it looked on indifferently from the sidelines. Beneath their indifference was fear. What if someday I take a misstep, would I end up like that person?""  
>""pg. 170*  
  
>""We're living in a world where everyone reveals too much of themselves.""  
>*pg. 184*  
  
>""A life surrounded by good people is a successful life. It might not be success as defined by society, but thanks to the people around you, each day is a successful day.""

So for example like today I got up for work and felt the anxiety building up already (I've been in this spiral the past few days of being anxious/having panic attacks because I was scared I was going to have another panic attack). I already know for some reason coffee makes me sleepy, so before I got to work I randomly decided to go to starbucks and down a chai tea latte with a single. And when I got to work most of my anxious thoughts were gone? It's like they all went into a big fuzzy cloud or something and out of my mind (idk how to explain it). And I felt much more relaxed and calm and I lasted the whole work day without any more anxiety or panic. I may as well have drunk a gallon of chamomile tea or something.

Like, is this just me? Or is something fundamentally wrong with my brain. I mean I guess I can't complain since coffee is easy to get but idk I'm just confused as hell",2,1760218924.0,Anxiety,14,1.0,False

This place represents class and beauty, but this kind of behavior ruins its image. It’s honestly sad to see because it shows how we are losing our sense of responsibility and basic manners.

I may be an outsider, I am not a citizen, but I grew up here in Riyadh. This city is like home to me, and it hurts to see people treat it this way.

July 11, 2129, Beijing.

I am a shadow in a foreign body, a whisper in a mind that is not my own. I am a spy. My true essence, the consciousness of a Taharagch, was torn from Ruha’sm, digitized, and forced into this fragile, human shell. This body was printed, copied from one of your prisoners—a technician from Beijing, captured when your line of defense collapsed in the early days. His memories, his life, have become my camouflage. Along with twenty-nine others, we were sent here, to Beijing, at the end of the battle for this cursed city. We are infiltrators, assassins, the Emperor's eyes in the heart of the enemy. Everything I see, everything I feel, everything I think, is transmitted live through a quantum transmitter nested at the base of my skull. My memories become His memories.

Over these few months, I have become human. I have learned your languages—I am fluent in English, Chinese, Spanish, and German. I have absorbed your culture, I watch your movies, I read your books, all to avoid detection. To become one of you.

Now, I sit at a table. The smell of coffee and fried rice fills the small apartment. This is not my home, but I must pretend it is. This is not my family, but I must pretend to love them.

""Honey, pass me the sandwiches,"" the woman says. My template's wife. Her face is tired, but in her eyes smolders a determination I see in all humans. I hand her the plate, smiling. This smile is learned; the muscles of my face move according to a recorded pattern.

""How is the armory? Are they repairing the damage?"" she asks, her voice full of genuine concern.

""Yes, honey, they're making repairs,"" I reply. I work in a factory that produces Perun SV3 rifles. What I see there freezes the blood in my reptilian veins. The saturation of personal weapons in this world is terrifying. Yesterday, on my way home, I spoke with a shopkeeper. He said he had been allocated a rifle and was waiting for delivery. The driver of the bus I was on said the same thing. Everyone, from the baker to the clerk, is waiting for their weapon.

Emperor, do you see this? The thought is like a silent report sent through the quantum ether. They are arming their entire population. Every civilian will become a soldier. I am terrified. I hope the Emperor sees this memory. My consciousness in the capital is updated live with the highest priority.

Our son, or rather, my template's son, enters the kitchen. He is thirteen. His face is still childish, but there is already a military discipline in his movements. Yesterday, while helping him with his lessons, I saw his textbook. They are teaching him to shoot in school. A thirteen-year-old child is learning ballistics and weapon handling. Even we, the Taharagch, who have waged campaigns of conquest for thousands of years, do not resort to such measures. Our young learn to hunt, to fight, but it is part of their nature, their coming of age. For humans, this is a system. A cold, calculated program designed to transform their entire race into one great army.

They are not fighting for territory, Emperor. They are fighting for survival. And they are willing to sacrifice everything, even the innocence of their children, to achieve it.

I look at this human family, at their daily rituals, their worries and small joys. I know that at any moment, I could kill them. My body, though human, is stronger, and my mind is that of a warrior. But my mission is not to kill these three. My mission is to observe. And what I see fills me with more terror than any battle. We are fighting a race that, in the face of a threat, has decided to stop being a civilization and to become a weapon. And I am trapped in its very heart. I am a chameleon that has adopted the colors of its surroundings so well that I fear one day, when I look in the mirror, I will see only a man. And that is the most terrible of tortures.

I returned after twelve hours. Twelve hours in the roar of machines, in the stench of heated metal and lubricants. The factory drains the last remnants of strength this weak, human body possesses. A meal was waiting on the table. My template's wife had made it. Steam rose from the bowl, carrying a scent that was at first alien to me, and now… now it is one of the few pleasures.

Human food is good. Spicy, full of flavors that are nowhere to be found in our nutrient pastes. I've taken a liking to breaded chicken with rice. A crispy shell, soft meat inside. Simple, primitive, and yet… satisfying. It's one of the pleasures of the day's end. I eat slowly, analyzing every bite.

I washed. The water rinsed the factory grime from me, but it did not wash away who I am. In the bed, she was waiting. My template's wife. She lay on her side, and her gaze… From my analysis, she desires copulation. It is another ritual I must perform.

She says to me, ""We haven't made love in a long time, Liu. I know, the war, but I'm in the mood tonight.""

Her voice is soft. I know I should feel desire. Instead, I feel only fatigue and the coldness of duty.

""I'm tired, honey, but I'll try to please you tonight,"" I reply. The words flow from my mouth automatically, perfectly suited to the situation.

I follow the data. I access fragments of the template's memories. I know how to touch her. Where her skin is most sensitive. I know how to kiss her to elicit a sigh. My hands and lips move with the precision of a machine executing a programmed task. I am an actor playing a role I hate. She moans with pleasure, unaware that she is being touched not by her husband, but by a monster in his skin. An alien who performs this biological dance with disgust.

Emperor, do you see this too? Do you see how deep we must sink into their filth to fulfill our mission?

In the morning, I wake up to a coffee waiting for me by the bed. The template's wife, already dressed, is bustling about the kitchen. She places a bag with sandwiches for work on the table. A gesture of care. Another element of their culture that I must imitate and reciprocate. I take the bag.

""Thank you, darling.""

I leave. The door closes behind me. Another twelve-hour shift awaits. Another hundred thousand Perun units will roll off the factory line. A hundred thousand tools of death that my brothers will have to overcome. And I, their spy, am helping to build them.

I have the day off. An absurd, human word. They are finally repairing the factory roof after the battle; it will take four days. Four days of apparent normalcy, which for me are four days of heightened observation. Today, I am to pick up my template's son from school. Another ritual, another test of my camouflage.

I stand in the schoolyard and feel a cold shiver crawl down my spine. I see an obstacle course. Climbing walls, tunnels, balance beams. Similar to those I've seen in your propaganda broadcasts, where the Guard trains. My son, the template's son, is racing on it against a female from his class. Their movements are agile, determined. This is not play. This is selection. From the youngest age, you test their fitness, their will to fight.

Other children are running around. Seven-year-olds. In their small hands, I see plastic pistols and rifles—miniature replicas of Peruns. I watch how they hold them. It is not the clumsy grip of a child. They are learning the correct stance, learning to aim. From childhood. Your toys are tools of indoctrination. You instill in them the reflex to kill before they even learn to write.

Emperor, look at this memory. Look at these small, human larvae who are already soldiers. Even we, the Taharagch, a race of warriors that has waged campaigns of conquest for thousands of years, do not resort to such measures. Our young learn to fight, but it comes naturally. For them, it is a system. An organized, merciless program for breeding predators.

The template's son runs up to me, sweaty, but with a triumphant smile on his face. ""Dad, did you see?! I won!""

I place a hand on his shoulder, forcing the muscles of my face to form something that is meant to resemble fatherly pride. Inside, I feel only ice. This is not a child. This is a weapon. A weapon that in a few years will be killing my brothers.

I look at all these laughing, seemingly carefree people, and I know one thing with absolute certainty. There is no negotiating with this race. It cannot be enslaved.

Emperor, listen to me. Listen to my terror. This planet must be reduced to ashes. It must be burned to cinders before the nightmare they are breeding here spills out across the galaxy.

Ruha’sm, capital of the Scourge Empire.

The throne room was dark, illuminated only by the cold, eerie glow of the central holoprojector. A three-dimensional, pulsating image of a human apartment floated in the air, replaying the spy's memories from Beijing in real-time. Emperor Pah’morgh sat on his stone throne, motionless as a statue, his reptilian eyes staring at the scene with inhuman intensity. Beside him, in the half-light, stood his new advisors—battle-hardened commanders whose shadows crept along the brutalist walls of the hall. Among them was Goth’roh.

On the hologram, the human template's wife was handing her spy-husband sandwiches.

""Look at that,"" snarled one of the generals from the K'borrh front, S’harar. ""Their females serve them. They are weak.""

""Weak?"" Goth’roh's voice was low and gravelly, carrying the echo of three deaths. ""Look into her eyes, General. That is not weakness. That is the fuel that drives their males to fight. That day, he will go to the factory and assemble another rifle that will kill one of ours. He will do it for her and for their larva.""

The hologram shifted. It now showed a school playground. Seven-year-old children with miniature replicas of plasma rifles, learning shooting stances.

The Emperor watched in silence as the template's thirteen-year-old son navigated the obstacle course. Every one of his movements was being analyzed.

""I reported this, Emperor, after the battle,"" Goth’roh spoke, not taking his eyes off the hologram. His voice was calm but carried the weight of an eyewitness. ""I was not exaggerating. What we are seeing is not an isolated case. This is their doctrine. The spies' observations fully align with my own. This is a race that, in the face of a threat, has decided to stop being a civilization. It has decided to become a weapon.""

Pah’morgh rose. His powerful silhouette seemed to absorb the light. He approached the holoprojector and, with a gesture, switched off the transmission. The hall plunged into almost complete darkness, illuminated only by a strategic map of the galaxy.

""They are a plague,"" the Emperor stated, his voice as cold as the interstellar void. ""They are a cancer that must be excised before it metastasizes. Their determination, their capacity for total mobilization… this is a threat we cannot ignore. Prepare the relativistic weapon. Calculate a trajectory for their sun. If we cannot have their planet as a hatchery, no one will have it. We will end this before it truly begins.""

A deathly silence fell upon the hall. Even the most hardened generals felt a cold chill. A relativistic weapon. The final solution. A projectile the size of a dreadnought, full of antimatter, accelerated to 0.5c, capable of turning a star into a supernova and an entire planetary system into dust.

""No, Emperor,"" Goth’roh's voice was quiet, but it cut through the silence with the force of a blade.

All heads turned towards him. To oppose the Emperor at such a moment was suicide.

""It is not honorable,"" Goth’roh continued, approaching the throne and kneeling on one knee. ""We are the Taharagch. We are conquerors. To destroy from afar, like cowards, is not in our nature. For thousands of years, we have conquered, broken resistance, and incorporated the worthy into the Empire. These humans… they are different. Finally, after centuries of easy conquests, we have an enemy. An enemy worthy of our strength, our cunning. An enemy that will force us to become better warriors.""

He stood up, his eyes blazing. ""I respect them. Just as I respect the K'borrh for their fury, the Gignians for their engineering genius, and the Ullaans for their ghastly effectiveness. These are races that fight. They offer resistance. And fighting a worthy adversary brings honor, even in death. Destroying their planet from a safe distance will bring us only shame.""

Pah’morgh listened, his face an unmoving mask.

""There is also another reason, Emperor,"" Goth’roh added, his tone becoming purely analytical. ""A strategic one. The humans are not alone. They have allies given to them by the Swarm. Allies who have proven they can think as we do—brutally and effectively. If we start destroying planets, what is to stop the Ullaans from responding in kind? What is to stop them from sending their own stealth ships on a mission to destroy our suns, our worlds? We will start a war of annihilation in which even we, with all our power, could lose everything. We will create a precedent that will turn against us.""

The Emperor was silent for a long moment. He paced the hall, his heavy footsteps echoing off the stone floor. Finally, he stopped before Goth’roh.

""Your words about honor are sentimental, Goth’roh,"" he said, but there was no anger in his voice, only cold calculation. ""But your words about strategy… they have weight. You are right. We cannot risk a total war with the entire coalition. One in which we could lose dozens of suns and systems.""

He looked at his terrified generals.

""The plan to destroy Earth is canceled. Instead, we will prepare a new, larger fleet and a new strategy for conquest. Goth’roh,"" he addressed him. ""You, who have known them up close. You, who have died at their hands three times. You will devise the plan. You are to understand them like no other. Find their weakness. Break them. But break them in battle. On their own soil. I want to see their determination, their fury… I want to see it die in their eyes as they kneel before the might of the Empire.""

Goth’roh bowed his head. ""Yes, my Emperor.""

He knew the task ahead was almost impossible. But he also felt a strange, dark satisfaction. The war with the humans would not be easy. It would be bloody, brutal, and long. It would be a true war. And he, Goth’roh, a veteran of three deaths, could ask for nothing more.

Chapter 44: Chameleon.

July 11, 2129, Beijing.

I am a shadow in a foreign body, a whisper in a mind that is not my own. I am a spy. My true essence, the consciousness of a Taharagch, was torn from Ruha’sm, digitized, and forced into this fragile, human shell. This body was printed, copied from one of your prisoners—a technician from Beijing, captured when your line of defense collapsed in the early days. His memories, his life, have become my camouflage. Along with twenty-nine others, we were sent here, to Beijing, at the end of the battle for this cursed city. We are infiltrators, assassins, the Emperor's eyes in the heart of the enemy. Everything I see, everything I feel, everything I think, is transmitted live through a quantum transmitter nested at the base of my skull. My memories become His memories.

Over these few months, I have become human. I have learned your languages—I am fluent in English, Chinese, Spanish, and German. I have absorbed your culture, I watch your movies, I read your books, all to avoid detection. To become one of you.

Now, I sit at a table. The smell of coffee and fried rice fills the small apartment. This is not my home, but I must pretend it is. This is not my family, but I must pretend to love them.

""Honey, pass me the sandwiches,"" the woman says. My template's wife. Her face is tired, but in her eyes smolders a determination I see in all humans. I hand her the plate, smiling. This smile is learned; the muscles of my face move according to a recorded pattern.

""How is the armory? Are they repairing the damage?"" she asks, her voice full of genuine concern.

""Yes, honey, they're making repairs,"" I reply. I work in a factory that produces Perun SV3 rifles. What I see there freezes the blood in my reptilian veins. The saturation of personal weapons in this world is terrifying. Yesterday, on my way home, I spoke with a shopkeeper. He said he had been allocated a rifle and was waiting for delivery. The driver of the bus I was on said the same thing. Everyone, from the baker to the clerk, is waiting for their weapon.

Emperor, do you see this? The thought is like a silent report sent through the quantum ether. They are arming their entire population. Every civilian will become a soldier. I am terrified. I hope the Emperor sees this memory. My consciousness in the capital is updated live with the highest priority.

Our son, or rather, my template's son, enters the kitchen. He is thirteen. His face is still childish, but there is already a military discipline in his movements. Yesterday, while helping him with his lessons, I saw his textbook. They are teaching him to shoot in school. A thirteen-year-old child is learning ballistics and weapon handling. Even we, the Taharagch, who have waged campaigns of conquest for thousands of years, do not resort to such measures. Our young learn to hunt, to fight, but it is part of their nature, their coming of age. For humans, this is a system. A cold, calculated program designed to transform their entire race into one great army.

They are not fighting for territory, Emperor. They are fighting for survival. And they are willing to sacrifice everything, even the innocence of their children, to achieve it.

I look at this human family, at their daily rituals, their worries and small joys. I know that at any moment, I could kill them. My body, though human, is stronger, and my mind is that of a warrior. But my mission is not to kill these three. My mission is to observe. And what I see fills me with more terror than any battle. We are fighting a race that, in the face of a threat, has decided to stop being a civilization and to become a weapon. And I am trapped in its very heart. I am a chameleon that has adopted the colors of its surroundings so well that I fear one day, when I look in the mirror, I will see only a man. And that is the most terrible of tortures.

I returned after twelve hours. Twelve hours in the roar of machines, in the stench of heated metal and lubricants. The factory drains the last remnants of strength this weak, human body possesses. A meal was waiting on the table. My template's wife had made it. Steam rose from the bowl, carrying a scent that was at first alien to me, and now… now it is one of the few pleasures.

Human food is good. Spicy, full of flavors that are nowhere to be found in our nutrient pastes. I've taken a liking to breaded chicken with rice. A crispy shell, soft meat inside.

Hey, AiContentAutomators fam! 

Ever get that gut-wrenching feeling like you’re racing against time? 😱 Like the clock is ticking, and Amazon’s Alexa is coming for your job? Well, guess what—it’s not your imagination! The AI revolution is happening, and if you’re not keeping up, you might just find yourself on the loser’s bench.

I mean, remember the early 2000s? *Blockbuster* had the throne and Netflix was just a tiny blip! Fast forward, and the only thing left of Blockbuster is nostalgia and a few old VHS tapes. Don’t let that be your career!

So, how do we avoid becoming the VHS tape of the AI era? Here are some quick tips:

**1. Embrace Continuous Learning**  
   - Online courses are popping up everywhere—think Coursera, edX, or even that funky link I stumbled upon called [Imagine Education AI](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals). Seriously, they offer some cool stuff that can boost your skills without breaking the bank!

**2. Build a Personal Project**  
   - Want to stand out? Create something unique that showcases your skills. Whether it’s a chatbot that offers unsolicited life advice or a simple blog about your AI journey, it’s all about practice!

**3. Network, Network, Network!**  
   - Join communities where other AI enthusiasts hang out (hey, like this one)! Share your experiences, ask for help, and be open to learning from others. Who knows, you might meet your future boss over a virtual cup of coffee ☕.

**4. Stay Updated with Trends**  
   - Did you know that by the time I finish this post, there’s probably a new AI tool launching? Stay curious! Subscribe to newsletters, listen to podcasts—or just scroll through relevant subreddits (like this one, am I right?).

**5. Don’t Fear the Robots**  
   - They say change is scary, but think of AI as a buddy that can help you work smarter, not harder. Your job isn’t about to vanish if you're adaptable. Embrace the change and evolve with it!

Now, before you panic and wonder if you’ll have to learn to become a robot whisperer, let’s remember one vital truth: there’s an enormous room for growth! You’ve got the power to be proactive and turn this tech rage into an opportunity rather than a threat.

Just think about it—are you going to sit there twiddling your thumbs while the future zooms past? Or will you step up, learn the ropes, and get ahead of the curve?

1o47i6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/dairyfree/comments/1o47i6w/dairyfree_peanut_butter_chocolate_coffee_ice_cream/,Dairy-free peanut butter chocolate coffee ice cream,"I recently got an ice cream maker, and found a recipe for a simple cashew + coconut vegan ice cream online.  After making it, I realized that, while it had the creaminess of milk-based ice cream, there was a bit of noticeable coconut and cashew flavor.  However, that coconut cashew combo made it taste a bit like coffee ice cream - not exactly, but in that ballpark.  So, I had the idea of adding some espresso to it, to see if the actual coffee flavor masks the cashew/coconut flavor, and results in ice cream that tastes like regular coffee ice cream.  And, it turns out, it does.

So I made another batch with cocoa and peanut butter along with a few other modifications, and it came out good enough that I thought it was worth sharing.

The directions with the Breville Smart Scoop are provided below because that's what I have - obviously you can adapt to your process if you have a different maker.

Blend together until completely smooth (a few minutes on high with a powerful blender), and then chill for at least a few hours:

* 1 can (13.5oz) coconut milk (I used the 365 Organic brand for the milk and cream)
* 1 can (13.5oz) coconut cream
* 1 cup raw cashews pre-soaked for \~12 hours and then drained (start with 2/3 cup dry - expands \~50% while soaking)
* 2/3 cup coconut sugar
* 1/2 cup cocoa powder
* 3 oz espresso (I used 2x 1.5 oz long shots from my Jura machine)
* 2 tablespoons vanilla extract
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum (optional, but the ice cream gets \*extremely\* hard after freezing without it - you have to let it sit out for at least half an hour before even thinking about trying to scoop it.)

Trigger the pre-cool cycle on the Smart Scoop before adding the ingredients, to freeze the ice cream bucket.  (If you don't have the Breville you can freeze the bucket overnight in your freezer instead.)

Add the chilled mixture to the bucket, and start the ice cream making process - I usually put the ice cream maker on the hardest setting, so it churns the longest, which is about 45 minutes to an hour.

The Smart Scoop will chime a short while before it's finished when it's time to add mix-ins, which can be added through the lid.  I spooned in about 1/3 of a cup or so of fresh-ground peanut butter (which can be made from roasted peanuts and salt in a food processor).

After the ice cream maker finishes, put the soft ice cream in a container and move it to the freezer.  After freezing for a few hours it will be hard and have a regular frozen ice-cream type texture to it.",1,1760218551.0,dairyfree,0,1.0,False

Also, To add. I have a 3.0, So i can’t do much. I thought i was kinda a loss cause for the health field because of it. But seeing you only need a 2.0 for some of the ‘online’ courses, It’s kinda surprising. (also, are they like legit??) But i would love your guys job recommendations and advice, The brain is so interesting and beautiful. To learn about it would be a blessing on its own.

I never went home for my dad’s funeral. I told myself it was because I was busy, but really, I was afraid.
We had not spoken in years. When my mom called, her crying was a high, thin sound. I did not ask for details. I did not fly home. The only thing I sent was the silence of my own guilt.

He had been sick for a while. Not a cancer you can fight, but something wrong in the head that ate away at the edges of who he was. My mom mentioned he started going to meetings, but when I asked what kind, her voice went flat.

The obituary said heart failure. Closed casket.
I buried my own regret under work and told myself it was better that way.

A year later, my mom called out of nowhere and asked if I was still coming home for Christmas.
I had not planned to, but the sheer, unfamiliar joy in her voice startled me into saying yes.

When I pulled up, it was already dark. The new house was enormous, bigger than they could ever afford, with a fresh, empty driveway and a porch light so bright it felt less like a welcome and more like a spotlight on a stage.

Mom opened the door before I could knock. She looked aggressively young. Her hair was a uniform, glossy black, and her skin was smooth, almost buffed. She hugged me like she was checking a box.

Then I saw him.

My dad.

I swear to God I almost dropped my bags.

He was sitting in his old recliner, watching a screen that displayed only a calm blue pattern. He looked up, smiled that wide, slow smile, and said, “Hey kiddo. Missed you.”

I froze in the doorway. The scent of the house, a strange sharp smell like metal and ozone, filled my lungs.

For a second I thought the guilt had finally broken my mind. But Mom just said dinner was almost ready and walked into the kitchen.

Dad stood, stretched, and clapped me on the shoulder. His hand was cold, but the texture was too smooth, like wax that had been handled.

“Glad you made it,” he said. “You look tired. Still dragging around all that old pain?”

I just stared at him. His eyes were the worst part. They were too still, too bright, reflecting the light in a way that showed no depth.

“Dad,” I whispered, “you died.”

He laughed, a sound that was a little too loud. “Heart attack scare. Your mom always overreacts. I started that new Therapy she mentioned.”

She had never mentioned it.

Dinner was alienating. The food was bland and had no aroma. They did not talk about memories, only about local news and neighbors, their conversation sounding like a pre-recorded loop. Every sentence felt correct, but entirely hollow.

When I went to bed that night, I heard them talking downstairs. Their voices were calm and even until my dad’s voice, now a fraction lower and heavier, cut through the quiet.

“He’s next. The pain is the key.”

The next morning Mom told me she had already booked me a session with Dad’s therapist.

“It’s not regular therapy,” she said, pouring black, unscented coffee. “It’s more of a system reset. Everyone around here is doing it.”

I said no. She just smiled, that same bright fixed smile, and acted like I had not spoken.

Dad drove me there anyway. The building was a small, modernist clinic surrounded by empty fields. The sign out front said:
THE WELLS INSTITUTE – RESTORE YOURSELF.

Inside, everything was white. Not clean hospital white, but a thick, matte, polished bone white. A woman at the desk greeted me by name, her gaze never leaving my face.

Dad patted my back. “Told you they’d take care of the mess you’ve been carrying.”

The therapist, Dr. Wells, was as unnervingly placid as Mom. She asked about my biggest burdens, my pain, my regrets, what I wanted to forget about my life and my father. My guilt felt like a physical weight in the sterile room.

She leaned in, eyes unblinking, and said, “He loves you. He brought you back so you could shed that burden and finally join him in his peace.”

I pretended to agree, nodding vaguely, and left the Institute with a racing heart.

That night I heard a wet, dragging sound outside my window. When I looked, my dad was standing alone in the backyard under the blinding porch light. He was whispering into the empty air.

Then I saw it. A tall, impossibly thin shadow, bent toward him like a black wire. Its head was high enough to graze the roofline.

When it turned toward the window, I did not see features, only a dense, absorbing blackness. I ran upstairs.

Mom was standing in the hall. She said, “He just wants to help you eliminate the noise.”

I locked my door and stayed awake, my phone clutched in my hand.

I should have left, but the wrongness of it all kept me rooted. I needed to know what had taken them.

So I went back to the clinic.

They put me in a white room with a simple chair and a full-length mirror. Dr. Wells told me to breathe and let go of the unnecessary emotional data.

The lights dimmed. The mirror rippled as if the glass was a sheet of black water.

Behind it, something moved.

It looked like smoke under pressure with a faint outline of a face. It pushed against the glass like it wanted out.

Dr. Wells whispered, “He gave you his body so the rest of you, the data, the consciousness, could live. It is your turn to give yours.”

The mirror cracked, a sharp, violent sound.

And in the cracks, trapped behind the smoke, I saw the truth. My real father. His face was gray and twisted, his mouth open in a silent, endless scream, trapped and powerless inside the thing that wore his face.

I screamed.

Dr. Wells said, “He was so proud of you for having the courage to come back.”

I woke up in the guest room. I do not remember being moved.

Mom was sitting on the edge of the bed, humming a tuneless, repetitive melody. She said, “You are almost ready. One more session and you will never feel anything detrimental again.”

Outside, I heard Dad talking with someone. His voice was lower now, heavier, and entirely devoid of the human rhythm I remembered. It sounded like something else was speaking through him.

I ran.


I am in a motel two towns away. My clothes still smell faintly of ozone and that sterile metal. I do not think they are my parents anymore. They are a perfectly maintained apparatus designed to lure me back.

And I know the thing inside my father has access to his memories.

I’ve been thinking about free will, and I’m stuck in a logical loop that I can't see a way out of. It seems like there are only two possibilities for how the universe works, and neither one leaves any room for actual choice.

Here’s my thinking:

**Scenario 1: The Universe is a chain of dominoes (Determinism).**

Imagine everything that happens is the result of something that happened before it, all the way back to the Big Bang. It’s all a giant, predictable chain of cause and effect.

If you could create a supercomputer and input every piece of information about the universe right now the position of every single atom you could, in theory, predict the future perfectly. That would include predicting every thought I'll ever have and every ""choice"" I'll ever make.

In this scenario, my feeling of choice is just an illusion. I'm not really choosing; I'm just playing out a part in a script that was written billions of years ago.

**Scenario 2: The Universe rolls dice (Quantum Randomness).**

Okay, so people bring up quantum mechanics, saying the universe isn't predictable, it's random at its core. But that doesn't save free will it actually makes it worse.

If my decisions are influenced by random quantum events in my brain, then my ""choice"" is just a random outcome. It wasn't made by *me*, my consciousness, or my values. **It was literally just a matter of luck.**

So if I ""choose"" to have coffee over tea, it wasn't a real decision. It was just a random neuron firing. This means I'm not a puppet following a script; I'm a puppet whose strings are being randomly jerked around. That's not freedom either.

**So, I’m trapped.**

Either my actions are predetermined and inevitable, or they are random and meaningless. Neither of these options feels like I have genuine ""free will.""

Am I missing something here? Is there a third option? Or is free will just an illusion that we have to live with?",1,1760218071.0,freewill,6,1.0,False

1o47ay7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenNoCensor/comments/1o47ay7/why_are_first_dates_always_canceling_at_the_last/,Why are first dates always canceling at the last minute? (Why do grown women in the 40's flake?),"I am sure there are lots of opinions on this, but I would love to hear from women who have actually done this. I won't be judgmental. I am just trying to learn so I can better at the online dating process.

So here is my scenario. I am a guy in my mid 40's trying to date women my same age. I have had a streak lately (5 out of 6 women?) where women cancel a first coffee/drink date the day of, claiming they are sick.  That is fine, things happen and (from my point of view) a first coffee or drink date is pretty low key. Easy enough to reschedule.   But in all of these cases, women then disappear (no longer respond ) and some have even unmatched me.  This is really confusing to me.

Going into all of the these first dates, chatting online seemed friendly.  When I ask the women if they would be up for coffee or a drink to chat more, all said yes and even made a point to say they were looking forward to it. I am considerate and reach out to confirm the date the day before.  Again, they all confirm and often indicate they are looking forward to it (literally say that... and send smiley emojis , etc).

Then they cancel (the morning of the date) saying they are sick.  In their message, they ask if we can reschedule. I try to be gracious about it.  I usually say that it is no problem, that I hope they feel well soon and let's reschedule once they are feeling better (i.e. There is no need to reschedule now since they don't know how long they will be feeling well).  I usually contact them a couple of days later to say hi, see how they are feeling and reschedule.  This is when they go silent and, in one case, I found myself unmatched.

This is confusing. We are all grown adults, what is going on here? If they were not interested, why say yes to coffee? Why did they keep saying they are looking forward to it?  Why claim being sick and then ghost? (They could easily have said no initially or ghosted when I first asked).  It would be one thing if this were high school...but these are grown women with careers, responsibilities, and seem to manage normal life. What is going on here? 

I am sure there are a million ideas out there, but I am not interested in speculation ( from pissed off guys).   I am more interested in hearing from women who have done this and getting their perspective.   No judgment at all, I am just a nice guy trying to understand what is happening on the other side of the app.  I really want to learn want to be able to do better.

P.S.  Please, everyone else, don't bash any women who share their rationale. This is a chance for all of us to learn. Thank you!

It had been three days since I last stared at the moon long enough to feel its weight pressing against my chest. Three days of circuits, recalibrations, coffee that tasted like metal, and the low hum of air filters that reminded me that even life had limits. The crew moved like ghosts through the corridors now, each wrapped in their own invisible shrouds. Jensen barked orders to systems that didn’t need barking at. Varga worked in silence, the metallic scrape of his tools punctuating the otherwise unbroken quiet. Suarez chattered incessantly, his voice bouncing off walls that offered no reply. Fischer’s jokes had become quieter, sardonic, thinner—their edges dulled by repetition. Mei Lin continued her quiet vigil, murmuring to sensors I barely understood, her face unreadable behind the glow of her data panels.

I watched it from the observation module again, drawn as if by a gravity stronger than the moon’s own. It hung there in black infinity, gray and cratered, as empty as it had been the last time I’d looked. But something in the way the light shifted along its ridges gnawed at me. A shadow that lingered too long. A ridge that seemed to curve differently than before. I blinked, forced myself to remember that human eyes lie after too long in isolation. The mind, when left alone with nothing but darkness, begins to invent.

I traced the familiar scars with my gaze. Every crater, every ridge, every subtle imperfection etched into its surface—I had memorized them. I could recite their positions blindfolded. And yet, for the first time, I couldn’t shake the suspicion that a detail had changed. A line that had been shallow before now appeared deeper. A shadow stretched farther than it should. Or maybe it was only me, my eyes playing tricks after months of zero-gravity staring.

The stillness of it all made it worse. Out here, movement is everything. Engines humming, lights cycling, alarms occasionally screaming—but the moon did not move. That was supposed to be comforting. That was supposed to be stable. Yet the silence it held had weight, as if it had been holding something back, and for a moment, I felt almost foolish for noticing.

I thought of Emma. I always think of her at these moments. The universe had claimed her in ways no one could undo, and still I stared at a rock far from home, searching for something, anything, that might make up for the loss. Maybe that’s why I noticed the tiniest inconsistencies—the faintest glimmer that didn’t belong. Perhaps it was my grief, or perhaps it was instinct, but I felt eyes on me in the quiet, though I knew it was only the reflection of my own.

Jensen came in then, as he always did, footsteps echoing like percussion. He leaned against the console, arms crossed, eyes flicking to the moon.  
“You’re staring at it again,” he said. No judgment. Just an observation.  
“I… I don’t know,” I said, my voice quieter than I expected. “Feels like it’s… changing. Or maybe I’m imagining it.”  
He snorted. “Space will do that to you. You start seeing ghosts in the dark, counting shadows, reading life into rocks. We’ve got enough problems with oxygen and fuel without adding paranoia.”

But I couldn’t let it go. Even as Jensen left, the image stuck in my mind: a ridge that looked like it had moved, a shadow that shouldn’t have been there. I rubbed my eyes and traced the map of craters again. No, the map didn’t lie. Something had shifted. Something subtle. Something impossible.

I sank into the viewport, pressing my forehead against the cool glass, letting the emptiness press into me, letting the isolation etch itself deeper. Out here, everything is amplified. Every heartbeat, every sigh, every blink becomes a monument to your own fragility.

I was beginning to understand what Varga meant when he said, *“Everything looks ugly when it’s dead.”* There is ugliness in death, yes, but there is a deeper terror in something that looks dead—and yet, in the shadows, moves imperceptibly.

And so I watched, and waited, and memorized, knowing that when the first true sign came, I would be ready to see it.

The next shift cycle came and went without incident—or so we told ourselves. But there’s a difference between nothing happening and everything being fine, a difference I’ve come to feel deep in my chest, where the hum of recycled air presses against your ribs like water. Suarez’s voice drifted down the corridor again, faster, more anxious than usual. I could hear him counting something in Portuguese, switching mid-sentence to English, then muttering nonsense syllables. He didn’t notice me watching, and I didn’t correct him. The boy needed his rituals, and I needed the silence.

Varga emerged from the maintenance bay, dragging a crate of spare filters across the module. His bandaged hands were blackened in places with grease, yet he moved with his usual confidence, like the ship itself was an extension of his body. He glanced at me briefly, then at the moon, and I thought I caught something—a twitch in his scarred jaw, a flicker of unease—but maybe it was just reflection. Varga doesn’t betray fear; he buries it too deep.

Mei Lin had disappeared for hours, resurfacing only when the orbital cycle shifted. I found her hunched over a sensor array, eyes scanning data streams with the kind of intensity that makes time itself slow. “The readings,” she said quietly, without looking up, “don’t make sense. Temperature fluctuations. Oxygen spikes. Minor—but consistent.”

“Consistent with what?” I asked.

“Nothing we’ve cataloged. Nothing expected. And the sensors are calibrated. Triple-checked.”

Jensen stormed in right then, pacing like a caged predator. He slammed a hand against a console. “Systems are fine. I’ve run simulations. There’s no anomaly. Stop imagining ghosts in the dark.”

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. I kept my eyes on the moon.

It was subtle—almost imperceptible. At first, I thought I was imagining it again: a shift in shadow, a ridge that seemed sharper, deeper. I knew it had been the same for three rotations. I had memorized it, traced it in my mind like the lines on my own hand. And yet…something had changed.

Fischer floated in then, chewing gum lazily. “Maybe the moon’s bored,” he said. “Been waiting a billion years, probably wants to watch us flail around.” He laughed, but it didn’t reach his eyes. Humor, I realized, is fragile here. Even jokes have weight.

Suarez piped up from somewhere behind us, his voice higher, faster. “Do you think it could…like…react to us? I mean, we’ve been staring at it! Maybe it knows we’re watching!”

Jensen barked at him. “Shut up! Do you want to drive everyone insane with nonsense?”

But Suarez didn’t stop talking. I could hear his rapid-fire syllables bouncing against the walls, a nervous drumbeat echoing off every corner of the ship. And through it all, the moon hung there, motionless—or at least, I thought it was.

Hours passed. We rotated duties, but no one slept well. Even Mei Lin, normally the epitome of calm, seemed more tense, more keyed in to the small variations in her instruments. We all felt it—though none of us would admit what “it” was.

I returned to the observation module at the end of my shift. Alone, finally. The air smelled metallic and faintly sour; I drank water slowly, savoring it because we rationed more than we needed to. I pressed my forehead to the glass, tracing the familiar craters once again, searching for the impossible, the detail that had shifted. And there it was. Or maybe it wasn’t.

A shadow stretched longer than it should have. A crater that had been shallow now seemed cavernous. The lines on the surface I had etched into memory were subtly…wrong. But it wasn’t fear I felt. Not yet. Just…attention. Focus. A need to see clearly, to memorize, to understand.

In space, even the smallest irregularity becomes monumental. Months of orbiting, of watching, of staring, had trained my eyes to catch what others might miss. And I was catching something.

I pulled Emma’s photo from my pocket, the faded image a fragile tether to memory. “We’re still looking, kiddo,” I whispered. “I think I might be seeing something.”

But what? That I could not yet say.

And somewhere deep in the ship, the hum of the recyclers adjusted, almost imperceptibly, as if it had noticed my attention.

I stayed there for hours, tracing every ridge, every shadow, every subtle anomaly, until the view blurred, until my eyes ached, until the moon seemed to pulse faintly beneath my gaze.

I didn’t know it then. I didn’t know that what I was seeing was the first whisper of something alive.

By the fourth day, the rhythm of the *Horizon* had changed. Not in any mechanical sense—the engines hummed steadily, the recyclers clicked and sighed as always—but in the air itself. The corridors felt tighter, smaller. Conversations had shortened. Meals were eaten in silence. Even Jensen’s incessant barking of orders had less energy behind it, as though the ship itself was pressing down on him.

Suarez was the first to crack. He started questioning every system aloud, tracing lines of logic that didn’t exist, speaking in rapid, overlapping streams of Portuguese and English, as though the languages themselves could ward off the creeping dread. Fischer laughed, but his laughter sounded brittle. Jensen barked at them both, telling them to focus, to act like professionals.

Varga said nothing. He never did, and yet he walked the halls slower, checking systems with a subtle caution, his eyes flicking to the moon whenever no one was looking. It was only after a long pause, when no one else was present, that I saw him tracing a shadow along the lunar ridges with his finger against the viewport. I didn’t speak. He didn’t look up.

Mei Lin was relentless. The fluctuations in the moon’s readings, subtle though they were, had her engrossed for hours. “Thermal spikes,” she muttered, eyes scanning her console. “Oxygen fluctuations. Magnetic interference. Minor, but consistent.” She didn’t look at me when she said it. She never needed to. I had already noticed.

I spent most of my time in the observation module now, tracing the moon over and over. The surface seemed familiar and alien at once. Shadows stretched differently in ways that defied the slow, predictable rotation I had memorized. Craters deepened slightly, ridges sharpened, subtle shifts that, if I blinked, I could convince myself hadn’t changed at all. But I never blinked. Not for long. I could not.

Fischer floated in mid-module one shift, spinning a wrench lazily between his hands. “You all staring at that gray rock again?” he asked. His voice carried mockery, but the edge of unease was audible. Even his jokes were hollow. “Maybe it’s lonely. We should wave.”

Jensen barked at him. “We are not waving to rocks, Fischer! We’re professionals, damn it! Focus!”

Fischer shrugged, lips twitching. “Professional, sure. Until the rock starts moving.”

I swallowed. My chest tightened. Could I be imagining it? That thought crept into my mind, insidious and unwelcome. Months of isolation and sensory deprivation make fools of even the sharpest minds. But I couldn’t let it go. I traced the shadow of a familiar ridge again. Something…was off.

It was subtle at first. A ridge deeper than memory. A crater slightly wider. But as hours passed, I began to notice patterns in the anomalies—temperature readings that mirrored changes in shadow. Oxygen spikes at precise intervals. Magnetic pulses with no origin. Mei Lin’s sensors corroborated it, but she called it “statistical noise.” Varga shrugged. Jensen refused to acknowledge it. Suarez kept talking, faster and louder, trying to convince us it was nothing. Fischer laughed at every mention of it.

Alone in the observation module, I felt my focus sharpen. Months of memorization had trained my eyes to notice the smallest deviations. I saw ridges shift imperceptibly, shadows stretch beyond their expected bounds, lines of lunar dust that should have been static, subtly displaced. It was nothing—and everything.

I traced every detail, careful, deliberate, as if engraving it into my memory. The ship hummed around me. The air smelled metallic. Lights pulsed faintly. My reflection stared back from the viewport, hollow-eyed, gaunt. I imagined Emma’s voice, her laughter faint and ragged in my memory, a tether to something human.

And yet, I began to wonder: what if I was not alone in noticing? What if the rock itself had awareness?

I shook my head. Ridiculous. There is no life here. Nothing but stone and dust. The moon is dead.

But I could not stop looking.

Hours later, Jensen found me still there, pressed against the glass, tracing craters with my eyes. He said nothing at first, then muttered, almost to himself, “Stop staring. You’re making everyone paranoid.”

I want to learn and do better.,"I am sure there are lots of opinions on this, but I would love to hear from women who have actually done this. I won't be judgmental. I am just trying to learn so I can better at the online dating process.

So here is my scenario. I am a guy in my mid 40's trying to date women my same age. I have had a streak lately (5 out of 6 women?) where women cancel a first coffee/drink date the day of, claiming they are sick.  That is fine, things happen and (from my point of view) a first coffee or drink date is pretty low key. Easy enough to reschedule.   But in all of these cases, women then disappear (no longer respond ) and some have even unmatched me.  This is really confusing to me.

Going into all of the these first dates, chatting online seemed friendly.  When I ask the women if they would be up for coffee or a drink to chat more, all said yes and even made a point to say they were looking forward to it. I am considerate and reach out to confirm the date the day before.  Again, they all confirm and often indicate they are looking forward to it (literally say that... and send smiley emojis , etc).

Then they cancel (the morning of the date) saying they are sick.  In their message, they ask if we can reschedule. I try to be gracious about it.  I usually say that it is no problem, that I hope they feel well soon and let's reschedule once they are feeling better (i.e. There is no need to reschedule now since they don't know how long they will be feeling well).  I usually contact them a couple of days later to say hi, see how they are feeling and reschedule.  This is when they go silent and, in one case, I found myself unmatched.

This is confusing. We are all grown adults, what is going on here? If they were not interested, why say yes to coffee? Why did they keep saying they are looking forward to it?  Why claim being sick and then ghost? (They could easily have said no initially or ghosted when I first asked).  It would be one thing if this were high school...but these are grown women with careers, responsibilities, and seem to manage normal life. What is going on here? 

I am sure there are a million ideas out there, but I am not interested in speculation ( from pissed off guys).   I am more interested in hearing from women who have done this and getting their perspective.   No judgment at all, I am just a nice guy trying to understand what is happening on the other side of the app.  I really want to learn want to be able to do better.

P.S.  Please, everyone else, don't bash any women who share their rationale. This is a chance for all of us to learn. Thank you!

**Sunday, October 26th, 1930**

*The Living Manor.*

I woke to a sound I had not heard since Friday: the common music of a lived-in home. 

Water ran in the pipes. A cart wheel murmured down a corridor. Somewhere a kettle sang. I lay still and listened. The hush of careful staging had lifted, and with it the dream of a museum kept by ghosts finally parted. 

I readied for the day and stepped through the threshold. The estate did indeed bear life within it. 

Outside a window showed two gardeners crossing the far terrace with rakes slung along their backs, boots printing the gravel still wet from night air. Inside, a porter passed through the hall with folded linen.

“Good morning, sir,” said a steward at my elbow. His coat was dark and well brushed. “Breakfast is being prepared for you.”

I fought a laugh. “Well aren't you a welcome sight.”

He gave the smallest bow. “I am pleased to hear that, sir. Please, come this way.”

As we walked he kept pace beside me. His steps a half-step out of rhythm, as if learning a gait long rehearsed in theory and never performed.

“Forgive an impertinent question,” I said. “Where were you all yesterday?”

“Preparing, sir.”

“For what?”

“For today, sir.”

“I was beginning to think the house was empty,” I said after a time.

“I regret to say your inkling was wrong, sir. We were here, listening to you,” he replied.

“Listening?”

He cast a look toward the stairwell. “Of course, sir. You spoke to us.”

“I… what do you mean?”

“When one speaks, one is heard. You were never alone. We valued your kind remarks and cannot wait for you to join us this evening.”

“And here I thought I was just speaking to empty halls. Why, if I may ask, appear now, and not before?”

He paused at the landing. “Because it was desired.”

“By whom?”

“By those who serve,” he said. “We have not been seen for a long while. We expressed our desire to attend to you in person. We found great enjoyment in hearing the sounds of a guest.”

“And the master approved of this… deviation?”

A trace of light reached his eyes like the flame of a fever. “He was persuaded, sir. Great works are often amended by necessity and passions. Though it helped that you sought us out first.”

I let the mystery go. Coffee floated up the stairs, and with it the light salt of broiled fish and the sweet tang of fresh fruit.

He guided me to the dining room. The vases along the sideboard held fresh plants and stems, their leaves still wet. 

“Please,” the steward said, drawing a chair. “And if you'd like, your morning paper,” he set a folded broadsheet by my cup. The masthead was from Albany and bore yesterday’s date. I saw an article from Denton advertised on the front page.

A woman in gray set down a dish in front of me. “If you require another egg,” she said, “ring once.” Her vowels were neat and her attention was fixed on the rim of the plate. I thanked her. She bowed and went.

I ate like a man found exonerated on all charges. 

“This manor makes for some strange bedfellows,” I said, with a mouthful of sugared fruit.

“Sir,” he replied.

“That wasn’t meant to be an insult. You keep good order.”

“That is the intention.”

“Will the master join us at any point today? I have yet to meet the man who invited me.”

He opened his shirt pocket and reached inside. An embossed creamy card lay within, the letters raised in sober black. He offered it to me.

“Your invitation, sir.”

It read:

*This evening in the great salon, at eight o’clock, the triennial procession will be presented. Your attendance is no longer requested as a mere journalist, but as a proper tenant of this estate. A.D.*

I turned the card and felt the bite of the letters against my skin. “At last,” I said. “The point toward which all this has marched.”

“As you say, sir.”

“Will there be many in attendance?”

“All who serve,” he answered, which I took to mean the entire staff.

“And the house shall attend too,” I said, half in jest.

A ghost of a smile touched his mouth. “The house is always present.”

He stepped back and let two porters pass with a folded carpet between them, both sharing its weight. Behind them came a boy with a box of bulbs wrapped in paper and tied with string.

I took the sights in and felt ease move through me. There is a sense of safety in the company of others.

**Sunday, October 26th, 1930**

*The Library and Workroom.*

When I finished eating, my plate was taken without flourish. Another cup of coffee was prepared for me at my right hand. 

The steward waited until I had emptied my second glass before asking, “Would you care to walk the rooms, sir? All of our staff are allowed entry.”

“I suppose I would,” I stirred from my seat. “That sounds like a wonderful gift.”

We set out on our tour.

The library opened like a great chamber carved from amber. Green-glass lamps cast their calm over the reading tables. Shelves rose from floor to ceiling, each tier numbered in gilded characters that caught the light. 

A ladder waited among them, wheels chalked in place. Between the shelves hung framed blueprints of bridges, arches, and grid cities drawn in heavy ink.

Even though every shelf stood full, nothing felt random. Upper tiers held architecture, city planning, hydraulics. The middle ranks turned stranger with titles such as: ‘*Treatises on Natural Order*,’ ‘*Structures of Elysian Design*,’ ‘*Magnetism and Manifestation*.’

On the lowest shelf a set of volumes in tarnished leather bore a single embossed title: ‘*Mechanics of Deiform Adaptation*.’ Their spines carried diagrams of orbits and cogs.

“The master read from those the most often,” the steward said. “Imported from Munich, I believe.”

I set a finger to the edge of one of their covers. The binding held warmth, though the lamp above gave little heat. I drew back, uneasy at the sensation.

“Good Lord,” I said, near to myself. “He has catalogued creation itself.”

The steward gave no reply, but his attention lingered on the books as if to confirm my exaggeration.

Beside a writing desk resided a small lectern. Upon it rested a chained tome of heavier make than the others. Its title read ‘*Lemuric Tables of the Ninth Configuration’.* 

I turned a page and met with the same drawings I had seen behind the wall panel: latticed diagrams of motion and spiraling currents rendered in metallic prose. Each depiction labeled with symbols from no language I knew. Between the lines ran faint notations of ideal temperatures and prime decibel rates.

“The master crafted that text himself. He called it his great Magnum Opus. He said it showed the same order that guides both atom and empire.”

I followed the ink line by line. “What is it about?” I asked.

The steward studied the text without a change of face. “A study of language, I believe. The master held that the small and the vast share a single alphabet. He called it the law of resemblance. He thought the same grammar could guide living engines.”

 “Living engines?” I asked.

“The difference between faith and voltage is smaller than most care to see.”

I traced the outline of one sigil with the barrel of my pen. It resembled a circuit’s spine, yet its pattern held the balance of a cathedral plan. There was beauty in it, along with something that repelled my eye.

I looked toward the shelves again. Certain books bore no titles.

“May I see one of the unnamed writings?”

He considered for a moment, then drew a single volume free and set it on the table. “You may read what is written, but you may not speak the words aloud. The words are meant only for the master's mouth.”

The pages held mechanical sketches that seemed to shift under the lamp. Some represented tools while others proposed devices of unclear purpose. 

Among them stood human figures composed of gears and valves, limbs rendered in cross-sections with their hearts replaced by spools of copper wire.

I closed the cover and stepped back. The steward returned it to the shelf.

“The master read here at night,” the steward said. “He preferred the quiet hours of the evenings. He read more than he slept.”

“I must say, this is a different house than the one I walked last night,” I said.

“It is the same house,” he replied. “Only seen in a different light.”

He stepped aside and let me through.

We passed the court windows and I looked out upon the twelve statues in the garden. No statue had shifted. The brass giants kept their places. 

For the first time since Friday it truly came to me that the last two days might indeed have been a careful spectacle. A simple long curtain-raise designed to sharpen the appreciation of a very private pageant.

The steward halted at a plain door at the end of a corridor. Its brass knob was unadorned, faintly tarnished where use had marked it.

“Would you like to see the workroom, sir? It is not often shown, even to servants, though the master has granted us permission.”

“Very much so.”

He unlocked the narrow door with a small toothed key. The air within carried a scent of graphite and sweat. 

The room stood vast and high, lit by a single glass skylight veined with steel. Drafting tables stood against the walls. Pencils lay where they had fallen. Compasses sat open across sheaves of linen paper. 

Some patterns around the room repeated the same sigils I had seen in the *Lemuric Tables*, only here they were drawn with a deeper intention. 

Across the room, a set of glass tubes ran from floorboard to ceiling, filled with a liquid metal that moved at the base. Small pistons pulsed along their lengths, keeping the substance in slow circulation. The light that passed through them carried the same color as the manor’s circuits.

“He used mercury as a conductor,” the steward explained. “It keeps the thoughts of the house connected to the will of his hand.”

“The thoughts?” I said.

“The master believed that if structure could be made precise enough, thought would follow. A perfect ratio invites a perfect mind. Thus he made this manor a vessel.”

I walked to the central platform. There the great table stood ringed by iron lamps with shades blackened by dust. Upon its surface rested a full scale model of the manor. The detail struck me dumb for a beat. 

Every corner and recess, every window and parapet had been rendered with a jeweler’s care. Even the courtyard figures stood where they should, fixed in their miniature devotions.

But what surrounded the manor silenced me further. The forest was gone. In its place rose a vast city of angles and towers. Bridges arched in strict repetition. Roads formed concentric rings that drew toward the center.

I leaned closer. Thin wires wound through the model’s base, twisting in strange loops. The manor stood at the heart of this circuitry.

The steward folded his hands at his waist. “He called this his rehearsal of the world to come. He believed this house would be the newest creation of a grand design. A gateway to cities thought unimaginable.”

The longer I studied the city, the more its impossibility showed. Streets folded into one another, becoming corridors without entry or end.

“Where would a man walk in such a place?” I asked.

“He would not walk, sir. He would circulate. He would be provided only what he needs to function.”

Beneath the table the machinery stirred. A pulse of light moved through the copper and up into the city. 

One tower flickered, then another, until a low glow spread outward like dawn through fog. The illumination reached the manor’s model and held it in a halo.

I stood astonished at the glowing city.

“You have done well,” I told the steward, and meant it. “The show has been spectacular.”

“We endeavor to please, sir. Just remember, eight o’clock you are expected. Until then, the estate is at your disposal.”

We left the room as we found it. The key turned. The breath of graphite and casein stayed behind the door.

All afternoon the house wore its best manners. 

**Sunday, October 26th, 1930**

*The Pageant.*

I spent the early hours before eight in ordinary pleasure. 

In a small sitting room I found a tray of little cakes, sugared just enough to catch the light. I ate one and let a laugh slip out. In another life I might have stayed and written a polite column about a fine estate.

A maid passed with a tray of small glasses. “Cider, sir?”

“Gladly,” I said, and took one. It tasted like an entire orchard held within a single glass. 

At a quarter before eight the steward met me outside the great salon.

“If you would,” he said, smoothing his coat. Several seams had darkened and appeared singed and rewoven. He paid it no mind and I chose not to break the spell.

Ahead the salon had been set as a theater. Chairs stood in ranks, each aligned to face a stage. Chrome lamps climbed in tiers. Their reflective shades raised a white shimmer that settled like stars across the ceiling. 

Workers and servants filed in wearing pressed uniforms buttoned with small moons. 

A curtain at the far end of the stage held my sight: a fall of dark glassy cloth, not velvet but some soft skin that drank in the light but kept its sheen. Above it a familiar crest showed two wings nested in a triangle worked in gold thread.

The steward led me to a seat at the center. 

“The master will attend shortly.” 

“Will the master be speaking?”

A courteous curve touched his expression, the corners of his lips parted like cracked paper. He raised a forefinger as if to test for rain, then lowered it with a satisfied nod.

“He is here.”

The lamps dimmed. From the wings of the room a hush moved in like a tide.

Then he came.

The architect walked out from the wing like a depiction from a drawing. He stood tall and exact, coat cut to a blade, hair white as ground salt. He did not hurry. Nothing in him hurried. When he halted at the center of the stage, the room seemed to lean forward and inch.

“My friends,” he said. His voice was as clear as a bell. “You have labored with me through seasons of frost and mud. You have kept the shine where it belonged and taken the dust from where it did not. I promised you a complete work. Three years ago I delivered it. Tonight I will deliver it again.”

He raised a hand toward a great window above him, its glass blackened to keep out the sky.

“This is our night. Many years ago we opened our sight for the first time. You sat where you sit now, each of you faithful to my word. That night our world was opened up to the world of dreams. It lasted for only a mere instant. And in that moment, we had been viewed with approval.”

A ripple moved the crowd. His hands opened as if presenting a blueprint before the sun.

“For seven years before that night I walked in the city of dreams only in my sleep. Its streets ran beneath my eyelids, its towers rose in the pulses behind my eyes. 

“I wandered there while my body lay still in this world. I saw patterns that no ruler could measure, lines that knew where they must go before any hand could guide them. 

“From that city I learned proportion beyond reason, and from its grid I drew the lifeblood that gave this place its existence. 

“Every wall you touch, every stair you climb, speaks in the language of dreams.”

He paused. The lamps surged, their glow deepening to a vivid gold.

“I did not work alone. As you know, a hand guided me. Not a hand of flesh. A hand of sovereignty. An emperor that knows how to rule a city without speaking. It placed its hand upon me and moved my tools until they obeyed its rhythm.

“It taught me to build as the heart builds, to thread the house with nerves of copper and iron until it could remember the dream from which it came.

“This is not sorcery,” he said. “This is order. The law of pattern brought to completion. I call this manor the aperture which touches the land of my dreams. 

“I once more bestow this manor with the same name I see written on the walls behind my eyelids. 

“Attend.”

The curtain to his back rose without rope or pulley. Behind it a pillar stood revealed, taller than two men and wider than a carriage way, its span forged of brass and panes of dark glass with the depth of water. The lintel carried tall letters that seemed to move while standing still.

I read the word inscribed upon it twice before my mind accepted it.

**PANDÆMONIUM.**

With that word the heat rose at once. 

Cloth stuck at the small of my back. Air drew toward the pillar and took the air from my lungs. The lamps brightened until they sang.

I turned to take in the room as a whole.

The audience had changed while I had attended the speech. Faces I once considered handsome now drew tight. Mouths had been pulled back. Teeth showed like exposed hardware. A footman near the aisle buckled backward at the knees yet kept standing. Meanwhile a maid next to him had her skin begin blistering in bubbles across her cheeks.

No one screamed though several mouths opened and did not close. The sound that came out of them was from a parched choir, a gathering of throats without water. Fingernails blackened before me. Vapor climbed from skin.

The steward who had seated me went to both knees. He slithered on the ground with a grace that would have pleased a dancer. 

A seam along his collar had parted and exposed a ribbon of copper laid against his throat. It flickered under the light like a small fish beating against a net. He pressed the seam closed with his palm and kept to his dance.

“Do not be afraid,” the architect said. “Step through and be made equal to yourselves.” His hand cut a narrow path in the air. “What you mistake for torment is only the shedding of variance. What you call death is only a species of waste. The city allows for nothing to be wasted. 

“Three years ago you were shown the first light. Tonight you will walk within it.”

Glass in the high window gave way with a cough. Shards and soot fell over the ranks. The architect smiled. Along the line where gum met tooth ran a deep char the color of coal. 

“People of the work,” he said, “the gate is open.”

A woman by the aisle turned her face. Skin at her neck parted like paint on a hot pipe. She did not falter. She moved for the pillar. Her joints were answering a lesson rehearsed for another stage and another body.

Several others fell in behind her. Their open mouths bobbing with each step.

“Sir,” I said to the steward at my side, though his pupils had clouded to ash, “we must leave.”

His mouth widened and held. At the base of his ear sat a wheel no wider than a coin. It turned one notch and stopped with a click. In that tick I met with a truth that I had refused to name.

They were not servants in the old sense. They were living machines. Kept, repaired, set to functions. The house had gifted them a form and taken its payment in their pain. Their autonomy had been bargained away long ago.

“Sir,” I said, “how long have you been like this?”

He parted his lips. No word came. Only a hiss of air through a crack that should have been flesh. He raised his palm as if to calm me, yet his palm shook from a tremor that did not belong to fear, but to strain without relief. 

The pillar drew air again. The house answered it. Its circuits spoke in rapid code beneath the floor like fluid driven through jets. Each pulse matched the heat’s ascent until all measured beats became one drum.

I fled.

The corridor that held the salon bent into a duplicate of itself. I saw a sunburst above the latter of the two halls and followed under it. Paint blistered in fish-scale patches. Light pooled rust-red on the floor and turned tacky under my soles.

I crossed the gallery and found one statue had stolen a half step it did not own yesterday. Its brass knees split open, each crevice widening with a low groan. Heat poured out of the fractures like breath from a furnace. 

Beneath the riven metal something living turned, its surface slick as ink. A round, colorless eye opened under the plating and fixed through the shell, as if trapped there for centuries and now waking to its hatred.

The other statues followed. Cracks raced through the figures. Light bled from their openings, and through the breaks I saw glimpses of the same eye repeated again and again, each glancing in different direction. 

The figures moaned in confinement. Brass screamed when they flexed.

I spared them no more of my time. I ran into the nearest passage, stumbling across uneven stone. Beams overhead shook with a low vibration. 

A cart stood ahead of me in the service lane. A porter braced upon it with both arms. Tar melted from the wheel's rim. He turned toward me. Stress lines scored beneath his eyes.

“You should be seated, sir,” he said. “Orders are orders.”

“What are you speaking of?”

“The word,” he answered. “We must keep to the word.” His cheeks cracked at the edges and did not bleed. A faint whirr came from the hinge of his elbow. He shivered. “Ring once if you require anything.” He repeated the phrase in broken repetition. “Ring once if you- if you- Ring once if you-.”

“Are you in pain?” I asked.

He pressed his forearm to the cart. Metal knocked together. “We remain in service.” His words fought against him as a vow he could not break.

I pushed past him. 

At the bend of the corridor I looked toward a window to gain my bearings. What waited beyond the glass stopped me.

The manor no longer sat in its clearing; it stood upon a wall at the edge of an endless city. Towers rose without tops, tier upon tier, while smaller buildings slanted among themselves and folded like knives. 

Streets ran in every direction, perfect in their geometry, endless in their descent. Bronze arches spanned avenues choked in smoke. Buildings glowed from within with light the color of molten ore. 

The sky turned in slow spirals, clouds thick with embers that fell like snow. In the far distance, beyond the outer spires, a shape moved.

It was vast enough to make the tallest towers seem no higher than undriven nails. Its gargantuan body lay half-buried in the ashy haze, but I saw its terrible heads through the clouds. All three of them. Each bending and lifting in turn. Each mouth gnashing upon the others. Teeth met teeth in endless hunger. 

The sound of its motion reached through the window, a deep grinding that set the glass to tremble. The sight and sound alone pressed hard enough to nearly buckle my knees. 

I knew then what had placed its hand upon the architect. And it was nothing of God.

I tore myself from the window. The walls sweated more thickly now. Plaster split in thin cracks that widened as I passed. 

The gramophones began speaking again in every hall. Each uttered a fragment of the architect’s tenor, all out of order. “Stay,” said one. “Open,” said another. “Return,” hissed a third. Their vocal cords twitched like nerves along the floor.

I set my palm to the wall to steady myself and felt the house draw and release against the meat of my hand.

At the corner a maid came forward with a basin. The sloshing water wore a skin of muck in dull colors. Steam rose from her wrists in little threads, heat alight beneath the skin. 

She set the basin down, lifted both arms as if for inspection, then spoke in the tone used at shop counters and streetcars. “Sir, are the lamps to your liking?”

“You’re burning,” I said.

“We keep the shine,” she answered. The words trembled. Her mouth tried to smile and forgot the motion. A brass staple held her lips apart on one side. “Please be seated when requested,” she added, as if reciting a rule from a handbook.

“Who did this to you? Was it the architect or the things outside?”

She turned, showing the back of her neck. There a gauge lay beneath the skin like a coin under parchment. It ticked, stopped, then ticked again. 

“The house remembers,” she said. She lifted the basin and went toward the glow behind me, leaving prints that smoked on the stone.

I lurched toward the vestibule.

Ahead, the front door stood ajar. Beyond it waited another, set deeper into the wall, a door that had not existed before. 

Between the two doors lay a grate that pushed out hot air with the smell of iron, oil, animal pens and charred meat. It was from the lungs of something far larger than the house itself.

Behind me came the sound of breaking metal. I turned. The entire staff stood attentive, souls in uniforms that no longer fit their bodies, patient before a gate they had tended to for years.

Near them a statue stepped from its plinth and set one terrible foot on the marble. Brass cracked open along the chest, and within the tear a heart of brilliant fire turned like a spindel. 

The room lit as a furnace. The room blazed. Curtains went to ash. 

A steward walked forward as if conjured by duty. He steadied himself as the floors shook under our feet. “Sir,” he said, “this is the hour. We would prefer you among us.”

“You are in pain,” I answered. “Why would I want this?”

“Pain is a word for those who have not yet experienced suffering,” he said. Then he lowered his regard and let the smallest confession slip. “Do not leave. Your words helped us remember who we were.” 

The steward’s mouth moved as if he tried to recall a name.

“You can leave with me,” I said.

“Our feet answer to the word,” he replied. A small gear turned under the skin at the base of his ear. It failed to mesh, skipped, and caught again. “Ring once if you require anything.” The phrase returned, stripped to reflex. “Ring once.”

He tore at himself, as if hunting the piece that kept his mind from reaching mouth. Flesh and mechanism left him and found a heap on the floor. The statue turned to face him.

I took that moment to kneel beside the pedestal where the first gramophone had stood. I set my notebook there, each page filled, every line a stake driven down with warning.

*If anyone finds this, you must retreat. This is not a spectacle. The conqueror that eats all pageants has paid this manor a visit and will not be satisfied with one appearance.*

*I am going through the second door now, because there is no other honest choice. My hope is simple: that it opens not upon that infernal city but back into the living world, into whatever grace that still waits for men.*

*If the city takes me, let this record be the warning you need to depart.*",9,1760217278.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

1o46zpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/1o46zpi/feeling_guilty_for_screening_her_calls/,Feeling guilty for screening her calls.,"Happy Saturday everyone! Just wanted to get this off my chest and also get some advice/validation.

I was enjoying a relaxing morning today after a stressful work week, drinking coffee and watching funny videos, when I saw my phone light up with a voicemail. (I have my phone set to Do Not Disturb, with only my husband and my boss’s numbers allowed through to let my phone ring and reach me directly.)

When I saw it was a voicemail from my uBPD mother, my stomach dropped, my guts cramped up, and I immediately felt shaky and anxious. I’m sure many of you can relate. I’m a 38-year-old married woman who lives 5 hours away, for goodness sake, and I still feel such anxiety and dread like I’m “in trouble” for something whenever I see her calls or texts.

We haven’t had any blowouts lately because I’m VLC, only responding with short pleasant messages or reactions in a group chat with her and my aunt, and I keep things very surface-level and grey rock whenever I can. I also ignore a fair amount of her random texts because I just don’t have the mental or emotional energy to write back and comment on every photo, political rant, or message about her exercise routine or whatever health issue she’s currently dealing with. I feel guilty that I simply don’t care anymore. 

She left a vague message (of course) in a “sweet”, cheerful voice “Hello! I guess you must be screening your calls, because you never pick up. You’re hard to get a hold of! I need you to call me.”

Who knows why I “need” to call her, it could be something completely innocuous. Maybe she wants to know when we’re coming over for our annual, obligatory migraine-inducing Christmas visit (UGH). Maybe she wants to complain about someone. Maybe she wants to nag me about something (Husband and I are currently behind on getting our wedding thank-you’s out, and she recently offered to ‘help’ because allegedly “everyone keeps asking about them!” Yeah, right.)

Part of me feels so angry when she does this and I’m mad that I’m letting my emotions ruin my peaceful Saturday off. I don’t know if I’m just paranoid, but I feel like she’s always intentionally vague so that she can ambush me with some kind of proverbial bomb when she has me alone on the phone. Her phone calls last at least an hour, at MINIMUM. A “quick call” has never existed in her world. It is impossible to get her off the phone early without her yelling or crying because she feels personally offended that we don’t have time to sit on the phone for over an hour.
She claims that “she wouldn’t have to talk for so long if I’d just pick up the phone once in awhile!” (Which is a lie. She was like this even when I was living at home or in contact with her daily.)

Part of me also feels guilty for leaving her on read and not returning her call just because I don’t feel like it. Part of me feels like I’m acting like a petulant, rude teenager for avoiding her. I also know that she’s getting older and she won’t be around forever, she’s lonely and has absolutely no social life and she and my eDad just coexist as basically roommates in the same home. 

TL;DR, I still haven’t called her back and I’d love some moral support or stories from other people so that I don’t feel so bad or guilty over this, lol.",4,1760217232.0,raisedbyborderlines,2,1.0,False

I’ve tested a handful of indoor bikes over the years, from noisy chain-driven models to over-priced “smart” bikes that felt like more hype than muscle. And then came the **YOSUDA Magnetic Exercise Bike**, a surprisingly smooth, whisper-quiet ride that instantly earned a permanent spot in my home gym.

If you’re hunting for an **exercise bike for home** that won’t break the bank or your floorboards, you might want to keep reading.

# Why the YOSUDA Bike Is a Game Changer for Home Workouts

The YOSUDA **magnetic indoor cycling bike** feels like that perfect balance between performance and practicality. It’s not trying to be a Peloton clone. Instead, it focuses on what actually matters: **quiet operation**, **sturdy build**, and **smooth resistance**.

I live in an apartment, so noise was a dealbreaker for me. The **belt drive system** on this YOSUDA bike keeps things *near silent*. I can easily binge a Netflix series or hop on a Zoom call right after a ride—no one would guess I just burned 400 calories.

# Key Highlights

* **300 lb weight capacity** – ideal for most riders, including taller or heavier users
* **Magnetic resistance knobs** – smoother transitions and zero friction wear
* **Adjustable seat and handlebars** – great ergonomics for multiple users
* **Tablet holder** – perfect for streaming workouts or watching shows
* **Low maintenance** – no brake pads to replace or adjust

If you’ve ever owned a brake pad model, you know how annoying it gets when the pads wear down. This magnetic system saves you that headache completely.

# Magnetic vs Brake Pad Exercise Bikes: What’s the Big Deal?

People often ask me: *Is magnetic resistance really better than brake pads?* Short answer—yes, 100%.

Brake pad bikes use friction to create resistance, which means parts wear out over time, and the ride tends to get noisy. The **magnetic resistance system** on the YOSUDA bike, on the other hand, uses magnets that move closer to the flywheel. No contact, no noise, and no maintenance.

That’s why this model is perfect if you’re looking for a **low noise exercise bike** for an apartment or shared space.

Another win? The **belt drive system**. Unlike chain drives, it doesn’t need oiling or tightening. You hop on, pedal, and that’s it—smooth, consistent, whisper-quiet motion every time.

# Comfort, Fit, and Adjustability: Getting the Setup Right

You can’t talk about indoor cycling without talking about comfort. Ever tried riding on a bike that felt like sitting on a rock? Yeah, no thanks.

The **adjustable seat height and fore-aft positioning** on this YOSUDA model make a world of difference. Whether you’re 5’1” or 6’4”, you can tweak the setup until it fits like a glove. I found the **ergonomics** spot-on—my knees tracked smoothly, and there was zero strain on my lower back.

# How to Adjust a YOSUDA Stationary Bike

Here’s what worked for me:

1. Set the **seat height** so your leg is slightly bent at the bottom of the pedal stroke.
2. Adjust the **fore-aft seat position** so your knee lines up with your pedal axle when your foot is at the front.
3. Raise or lower the **handlebars** depending on your flexibility and comfort.

Once I dialed in my fit, I could ride longer without any numbness or seat pain. Pro tip: a good **gel seat cover** or padded cycling shorts also make a big difference for long rides.

# Real Talk: Noise Levels and Apartment Use

Ever worried your downstairs neighbor might file a noise complaint mid-workout? You can relax. The **YOSUDA exercise bike** is honestly one of the **quietest stationary bikes** I’ve tested.

The **flywheel inertia** and **magnetic resistance** combo makes pedaling buttery smooth. Even during high-intensity sprints, there’s no rattling or squeaking—just that soft hum that’s oddly satisfying.

I tested it on hardwood floors, and with a **bike mat**, there was zero vibration transfer. So yes, to answer the big question: **the YOSUDA bike is quiet for apartments**.

# Resistance, Flywheel, and Ride Feel

The YOSUDA’s **35-pound flywheel** gives a surprisingly realistic road-feel. You get that steady resistance that keeps your cadence smooth and consistent. The **magnetic resistance knobs** let you increase or decrease intensity with a simple twist.

I like doing interval workouts—two minutes light, 30 seconds heavy—and the transition between levels feels seamless. No lag, no sudden jumps. It’s as smooth as bikes that cost double the price.

FYI, heavier flywheels usually mean smoother rides, but too heavy can make it harder to accelerate. YOSUDA found that sweet spot where it feels balanced and stable.

[Grab yours today and feel the difference →](https://amzn.to/42yPIx8)

# Stability and Build Quality: Can It Handle 300 Pounds?

A common question is, “**Which exercise bike supports 300 pounds?**” This one does, confidently.

The **steel frame stability** is impressive. No wobbling, no creaks, even when standing up for sprints. I’m about 210 pounds, and I’ve pushed this bike pretty hard—it didn’t flinch.

That’s partly thanks to the **four adjustable stabilizers** at the base. You can fine-tune the balance even if your floor isn’t perfectly level. The solid construction means it’ll last for years without shaking itself loose.

# Smart Features: Does the YOSUDA Bike Have an App?

Here’s where YOSUDA surprised me. While it’s not a full “smart bike,” it *does* include **Bluetooth connectivity** through the **YOSUDA app**.

You can sync your workouts, track your **cadence**, **calories**, **speed**, and **distance**, and even follow along with **beginner-friendly indoor cycling workouts**. The app also offers **free classes**, which is a nice bonus considering many competitors lock that behind a subscription paywall.

If you prefer third-party apps like **Kinomap** or **Zwift**, this model isn’t fully integrated, but for basic tracking and motivation, it gets the job done.

# The Tablet Holder and Device Setup

Let’s talk about the **exercise bike with tablet holder** feature, because that’s where I spend most of my rides.

The **holder** is sturdy and fits everything from phones to full-size iPads. I usually stream YouTube cycling classes or Netflix (guilty). The viewing angle is spot on—you don’t have to crane your neck or mess with awkward mounts.

This makes it a great **home workout bike with free classes** or your own playlists. I often queue up a 20-minute fat-burn ride, crank the resistance halfway, and just zone out.

Can you **lose weight with 20-minute cycling workouts**? Absolutely, if you stay consistent. I’ve personally shed about 10 pounds in a couple of months just using this for quick sessions between work tasks.

[Get the YOSUDA bike on Amazon →](https://amzn.to/42yPIx8)

# Maintenance and Durability: Set It and Forget It

One of my biggest pet peeves with older bikes was maintenance. Loose chains, worn brake pads, squeaky resistance knobs—it was endless. The **YOSUDA magnetic resistance** system removes almost all of that.

You don’t need to replace pads or oil chains. Just keep it clean, wipe down sweat after each session, and occasionally check the bolts. That’s it.

This truly is a **low maintenance magnetic resistance bike**. I’ve owned mine for over a year now, and it’s as quiet and smooth as day one. That alone makes it one of the **best magnetic exercise bikes for apartments** IMO.

# Who This Bike Is Best For

Here’s the thing: the **YOSUDA stationary bike** works for almost everyone, but it really shines for these groups:

* **Beginners** who want a friendly, easy setup and simple controls
* **Apartment dwellers** who need a **quiet stationary bike for small spaces**
* **Busy professionals** squeezing in 20-minute workouts
* **Heavier riders** who need that solid **exercise bike 300 lb capacity** frame
* **Couples or families** sharing one bike (it adjusts quickly between users)

And if you’re a stickler for comfort, the **adjustable seat** and handlebar setup let you dial in that perfect fit.

# Accessories and Optional Upgrades

While the core bike is solid, a few accessories can make the setup even better:

* **Exercise bike mat** (saves your floors and reduces vibration)
* **Gel seat cover** or padded shorts (for long rides)
* **SPD pedals** if you want clip-in cycling shoes
* **Tablet mount extension** for better screen angles
* **Heart rate monitor** for more accurate calorie tracking

YOSUDA also sells **replacement brake pads** for their non-magnetic models, but this one won’t ever need them—a big plus if you’re aiming for a **low maintenance** setup.

# Quick Setup and Assembly Tips

Setting up the bike took me about 25 minutes solo. The **YOSUDA setup and calibration guide** is straightforward, and the tools are included.

Just remember to tighten the bolts firmly before your first ride. If you hear any slight clicking later, it’s usually just a loose pedal or stabilizer—an easy fix.

Pro tip: keep a small wrench handy for minor adjustments, especially after your first week of use as the bolts settle in.

# Performance and Fat-Loss Potential

Can you really **burn fat** with an **indoor cycling bike**? You bet. Even a moderate 30-minute ride can burn anywhere between 250–400 calories depending on your weight and intensity.

Cycling is also **low impact**, which means it’s gentle on the joints while still torching calories. Combine it with light strength training or a balanced keto diet, and you’ve got a powerful fat-loss combo.

Personally, I use the YOSUDA for **HIIT rides** in the morning—short bursts of resistance followed by recovery spins. It wakes me up better than coffee and sets a great tone for the day.

# Final Thoughts: Worth the Hype?

So, is the **YOSUDA Magnetic Exercise Bike** worth it? In my honest opinion—yes, without a doubt.

You get a **solid steel frame**, **magnetic resistance**, a **belt drive system**, and **near-silent operation**, all under $500. Add in the **tablet holder**, **adjustability**, and **300 lb capacity**, and it’s hard to beat that value.

It’s a **quiet, durable, and beginner-friendly indoor cycling bike** that fits easily in small spaces and doesn’t require endless upkeep. Whether you’re new to cycling or just need a reliable cardio option at home, this one delivers.

# TL;DR (Quick Recap)

* **Magnetic resistance** = quiet, smooth, and zero maintenance
* **Belt drive** = whisper-quiet operation, no oiling needed
* **300 lb capacity** = solid, stable steel frame
* **Adjustable fit** = works for tall or short riders
* **Tablet holder** = stream workouts or Netflix
* **Perfect for apartments** = low noise and vibration

Walking into the coffee shop, my ears are greeted by the soft chime of a bell as I pull the door open, the rich smell of coffee hits my nose. Several tables and chairs line the left wall on the right wall sits the order and serving station for the coffee, the back wall on the left is a hallway that leads to bathrooms. Following the right-hand wall, more tables come into view. In the last table waving me down sits Pual with two coffees sitting on the table. Sitting down I point at the coffee and Paul nods, I take a sip from the coffee the cardboard hitting my lips before my tongue is assaulted by hot brown lava. Quickly setting the cup down I struggle to keep a straight face as my mouth is burned. As this is happening Paul reaches into his Jacket and pulls out a bottle of prescription medication without a label and sets it down in front of me. (Paul) “you forget how to drink or something”, (me) “it hot”. He shacks the bottle and pushes it to me across the table, (Paul) “these are what you asked for try to keep it to one a day you don’t want to overdose on these”, (me) “oh thanks” grabbing the bottle of pills I examine them while taking another sip of the coffee this time without burning my mouth. (me) “Why did you have to take the label off it looks like you gave me drugs”, I put the bottle into my pant pocket. He stands from his chair and pushes it into place, (Paul) “whatever Noah just take it before bed and don’t be late tomorrow we have a very tight schedule” he walks from the table and leaves the shop.

 

Standing from the table and finishing my coffee I leave as well. Back at my apartment, I head straight to the bathroom. Taking the pills from my pocket, I place them into the cabinet behind the mirror. Walking back out the bathroom and into my bedroom I finish packing for the lighthouse. Paul had given me the idea. He goes there every couple of months. Said it was quiet. Peaceful. He suggested I tag along and even got me a job handling storage. The pills he gave me are for sleep. Finishing up for the day I take a shower, walking out the bathroom I grab the pills out of the cabinet and walk to the bed. Taking a pill from the bottle. Placing the pill into my mouth I quickly swallow before getting into bed. Sleep comes quickly.

 

The space I found myself after opening my eyes is a space painted in darkness. In my right hand a lighter its cold and small, opening it reveals a wick and a flame bursts from it, its fire shines the space in yellow and reds. A hallway endless as far as I could see the walls lined with countless doors all different is shape and color. My left hand holds a candle, its cold. The wax leaves my hand slick, my body heat melting the wax just so slightly. I take the lighter from my right hand and use it to light the candle in my left, with the candle lit I walk down the hallway. Walking to the first door on my left I place the lighter on the ground and place my hand on the handle. The knob it cold, colder than the lighter the coldest thing I have ever felt, the handle does not turn. Turning from the door to the one across from it, I try the next, locked. I walk down the hallway trying every door and like the ones before each they all remain closed. The wax from the candle drips on my hand leaving my skin burned, the flame grows the closer it gets to my hand and the faster the wax melts. I continue down the hallway the candle melting in my hand as I walk. The candle’s light burns out, the wax no more, the flame diminished, I’m surrounded by blackness. With the flame gone so is my vision. I reach my hand out into the darkness, my hand grabs a warm piece of metal. This new think within my hand turns with it, the creaking of old hinges fills the absence of sound. Beyond the door, nothing, just like the hallway and yet, I step through.

 

My eyes snap open at my ceiling the paint is white and by blood cold, sitting up from the bed the sheets stick to my skin. I sit there for several moments before the alarm on my phone rings snapping me from hypnosis. Turning it off and gathering my things I place the pills in my bag and leave the apartment.

 

Getting to the pier I pull into one of the parking spaces and step out. Three other cars are parked in similar spots that I was in, two people are already on the boat with one grabbing bags from their car and another walking with several bags onto a boat. Stepping to the back of the car I grab my things from the trunk of the car and lock the doors as I walk to the boat. The pier creaks beneath my steps, its old wood sitting a few feet above the dark water. Small waves lap against the support beams, rippling outward until they fade into nothing. The wind comes off the sea blowing my hair and filling my nose with the sharp scent of salt and fish. Over the horizon I see a small island, green and gray. On top of a rock formation sits a lighthouse.

 

Stepping onto the boat I set my things down with the others. (Paul) “Good to see you made it was hopping I would have to turn this thing around to get you”, as he finished his sentence the last person gets on the boat. (unknown) “alright everyone stop what you are doing and listen up” the unknown person talking to everyone on the boat stand at the front looking to the back at us, the wind tugs his coat. (unknown) “for those of you who do not know my name is Jackob (he looks at me first, then continues looking at everyone) thank you for being here and on time at that, sit tight until we dock on the pier on the island, do and I cannot stress this enough NOT try and reach out the boat to quote “touch the waves as they pass” as you will fall in, (he turns to the island and points with his finger) one we get there stage your things just off the dock and then wait for everyone to get off before we head up it that understood”. He looks around the boat at everyone who is nodding their heads in approval and then sits down in one of the seats.

 

The boat takes off slowly at first, rocking back and forth on the waves. Some of the waves slap against the boat. I feel as though if I reached out, I could touch them. Turning to Paul (Noah) “hey I took one of those pills and I had the most vivid dream I have ever had in my whole life”. (Paul) “what happened”, (Noah) “I was walking down a hallway with a candle there where a lot of doors and every time I tried to open one it was locked”, finishing the retelling of my dream, I waited for a response but the one I got was not what I was expecting. (Paul) “I really don’t think it’s that big a deal if you don’t want to take them then don’t” he turns from me watching the shoreline grow smaller as we drift farther into the sea.

 

Turning from him I took to the island. The sun lays behind me still in early morning, it casts the lighthouse in purple while the sea in front of it is in bright blue. The waves crash in several directions breaking apart as we travel the empty water. The closer we get to the island the more I get a dreaded feeling. Not being able to place the feeling of unease I push it down into by bowels as the boat approaches the island.

1o46oae,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1o46oae/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

Net carbs, macros, ketosis... it’s like someone threw a chemistry book at your dinner plate. If you’ve ever stood in your kitchen wondering what on earth to eat (and how to make it before you get hangry), you’re definitely not alone.

That’s where the **Keto Diet Cookbook for Beginners: 2000 Days of Easy 30-Minute Recipes** steps in. Think of it as your personal keto sidekick — packed with simple, no-fuss meals that actually taste amazing. I’ve personally tested several of these recipes, and let’s just say my air fryer and I have become very close friends.

👉 **Affiliate link:** [Check it out on Amazon here](https://amzn.to/4ohcceq)

So, whether you’re looking to **lose weight**, **stay in ketosis**, or just eat better without spending your whole evening cooking, this book might be your best new kitchen buddy.

# What Makes This Keto Cookbook Stand Out

# 1. 2000 Days of Easy, Real-World Recipes

Yep, you read that right — **2000 days** of recipes. That’s more than **five years** of daily meal ideas. So if you’ve ever run out of inspiration after day three of keto, this cookbook’s got your back.

Each recipe focuses on **real ingredients**, not those weird “substitute this for that” hacks that make you question your life choices. You’ll find things like:

* **Keto Lemon Chicken with Asparagus**
* **Creamy Garlic Shrimp Zoodles**
* **Low-Carb Cheeseburger Casserole**
* **Chocolate Peanut Butter Fat Bombs**

Every dish is **ready in 30 minutes or less**, so you can cook, eat, and move on with your life.

👉 [Grab your copy here](https://amzn.to/4ohcceq)

# 2. Built for Beginners (No Fancy Tools Needed)

If your kitchen gear consists of a skillet, spatula, and some determination, you’re good. The author clearly understands that not everyone owns a sous-vide machine or wants to spend two hours prepping zucchini ribbons.

What I like most is how **beginner-friendly** the layout is. Each recipe includes:

* A short ingredient list
* Simple step-by-step instructions
* Clear macro breakdowns (fat, protein, carbs)
* Quick tips for swaps and add-ons

No fluff, no confusion — just solid keto cooking.

# 30-Minute Keto Meals That Actually Work

Let’s talk speed. We all love the idea of home-cooked meals, but who wants to spend an hour making dinner after work? This is where this **30-minute keto meal cookbook** really shines.

# Here’s what makes these recipes fast and practical:

* **Minimal prep:** Most ingredients are pantry staples or easy-to-find.
* **Batch-friendly:** Cook once, eat twice. Perfect for meal prep.
* **Simple cooking methods:** Skillet, oven, or air fryer — done.
* **Smart shortcuts:** Pre-cooked proteins or frozen veggies when you’re tight on time.

And let’s be real, sometimes the best “diet” is just one you can *actually* follow.

# The 4-Week Keto Meal Plan for Weight Loss

Ever started keto and thought, “So... what do I eat tomorrow?” Yeah, that’s the classic beginner panic. This cookbook fixes that with a full **4-week keto meal plan for weight loss**, designed to help you stay on track without having to think too hard.

Each week follows a simple formula:

* **Breakfasts** to keep you full (think omelets, chia pudding, or keto pancakes)
* **Lunches** that travel well and reheat easily
* **Dinners** that satisfy your cravings without breaking ketosis

Plus, it includes **shopping lists** and **meal prep tips**, so you don’t find yourself running to the store midweek for missing almond flour.

It’s structured for **gradual fat-burning success**, not starvation or carb withdrawal headaches. You’ll eat real food, feel full, and actually enjoy the process.

# Real Results: Why Keto Works (When Done Right)

So, what makes keto effective for fat loss and energy? It’s not just about eating bacon and skipping bread. The goal is to **train your body to burn fat for fuel** instead of relying on carbs.

When your body enters **ketosis**, it shifts gears — using fat (both dietary and stored) as its primary energy source. That means:

* **More stable energy** (no sugar crashes)
* **Better focus** throughout the day
* **Reduced cravings**, especially for sweets
* **Visible fat loss**, especially around the midsection

I’ve personally seen these benefits, especially the mental clarity part — no more 3 p.m. brain fog after lunch. :)

# My Take After Testing These Recipes

I’ve tried a handful of recipes from this **Keto Diet Cookbook for Beginners**, and honestly, I was impressed by how realistic they are for daily life. No obscure ingredients or 12-step processes — just **quick, low-carb meals** that actually taste like comfort food.

A few standouts from my own kitchen tests:

* **Buffalo Chicken Stuffed Peppers:** Creamy, spicy, and ridiculously satisfying.
* **Garlic Butter Salmon Skillet:** Takes 15 minutes, tastes like a restaurant dish.
* **Keto Cheesecake Bites:** The perfect sweet fix without guilt.

Every recipe I tested stayed within the keto macro limits, and most were perfect for meal prep. I double-checked the nutrition info (because I’m that person) — and it’s accurate.

# Who Should Buy This Cookbook?

If you fall into any of these categories, this book is 100% for you:

* You’re a **beginner** trying to figure out what keto even means.
* You want **quick, 30-minute meals** that don’t require fancy cooking skills.
* You’re looking for a **structured meal plan** to stay consistent.
* You’re tired of **boring chicken and cauliflower rice** every night.
* You want to **lose weight** without feeling hungry or deprived.

Basically, if you’re human and you eat food, you’ll probably find something here to love.

# Bonus: Tips for Keto Success

Starting keto doesn’t have to be a crash course in frustration. Here are a few **real-world tips** I’ve picked up over time:

1. **Keep your electrolytes balanced.** Low-carb diets can flush out sodium and potassium, so don’t skip salt.
2. **Prep in advance.** Batch cook proteins and store them for quick meals.
3. **Read labels.** Hidden carbs love to sneak into sauces and dressings.
4. **Stay hydrated.** Keto can dehydrate you fast. Water is your best friend.
5. **Be patient.** The first week can be rough. Once your body adapts, you’ll feel amazing.

These are all covered in the cookbook too, but it’s always nice to hear it from someone who’s been there, done that, and still enjoys buttered coffee in the morning.

# FAQs

# 1. How do I start the keto diet as a beginner?

Start by cutting your daily carb intake to **20–50 grams**, increase healthy fats (like avocado, olive oil, and nuts), and keep protein moderate. The cookbook walks you through exactly how to do this safely and effectively.

# 2. What are macros and why do they matter?

“Macros” are short for macronutrients — **fat, protein, and carbs**. Keto focuses on a ratio of about 70% fat, 25% protein, and 5% carbs to trigger ketosis. The recipes in this book are pre-calculated to fit those ratios.

# 3. Can I meal prep keto recipes in advance?

Absolutely. Most recipes are **meal-prep friendly**, meaning they store well in the fridge or freezer. The book even gives storage instructions for each meal.

# 4. What if I crave carbs?

Totally normal! The trick is to eat enough fat and protein so you stay full. The cookbook includes **craving-control recipes** that mimic carb-heavy favorites — like pizza bites and pancakes.

# 5. What is the best keto cookbook for beginners to buy?

In my opinion, this one wins for its **balance of simplicity, flavor, and structure**. It’s perfect for beginners who want real results without overcomplicating things.

# Final Thoughts

The **Keto Diet Cookbook for Beginners: 2000 Days of Easy 30-Minute Recipes** isn’t just another trendy book — it’s a complete **low-carb lifestyle guide** for real people with real schedules.

What I love most is how it strips away the confusion. You’re not bombarded with science jargon or unrealistic meal ideas. Instead, you get practical, tasty recipes you can actually make after a long day.

If you’ve been curious about keto but hesitant to start, this book makes it almost foolproof. And who knows — maybe in a few months, you’ll be the one sharing “before and after” stories.

So go ahead, grab your copy, fire up that skillet, and let’s make keto simple again.

This week would’ve been our one-year anniversary. He was in town visiting his little kid. On Monday, we had a fight — I told him, “Have a good life,” but I didn’t mean it as a breakup. I was just hurt. What started the argument was that his baby mama was at the hotel he was staying at — in slippers, holding coffee, and smirking at me when she came out of the lobby.

He said she was just dropping off their child, but when he scolded me and raised his voice, I got upset and left after my online class. I thought he’d apologize after a day once he cooled off. Instead, he acted like nothing happened and went about his life — even hanging out with his ex’s sister the next morning with his kid.

I later showed up at the hotel unannounced. He claimed he’d been dropped off and came back in an Uber, but there was no Uber record showing that. He stuck to that lie anyway. That’s when I realized there were probably a lot more lies I hadn’t uncovered.

I’m exhausted from being treated like I didn’t matter while his child’s mother enjoyed all the financial stability — the paid mortgage, car, and everything else she wanted. I wanted a real partnership, not to constantly feel like I came second. I’m just done. ",2,1760215831.0,BreakUps,14,1.0,False

I've been stressed about money, my whole life. Literally from the ages of 8 to the present day. I've been urgently stressed about how to make a living. The past 5 years its basically all I think about. I've been working at it my entire adult life.  Whenever I have a free second my mind wanders and I can't help but think about how much everything costs compared to how little I make. Its all consuming. 

My grandmother was a working poor single mother in the 70s. She eventually figured something out and had a decent career for a while in the 90s, ending in the round of layoff's following the 2008 recession, still; she was able to provide a decent retirement for herself. 

So I'm freaking out about money and she doesn't get it. She acts like this is how its always been. No; she doesn't get it. I face a worse reality as a skilled worker doing hard labor then she did as a single mom working at a coffee shop back in the day. 

We've been loosely formulating a plan for when my uncle passes, she thinks she's going into senior housing. But she really needs someone to look after her. I can't afford to stay in the area under said eventuality.

I have been an avid Keurig user for several years with the single-serve models. No matter how well I take care of them, clean them, or complete maintenance, they seem to crap out after 2 years and x amount of months. (I'm not one to leave old K-pods in there until next use. I'd remove the K-pod holder, then rinse it with tap water so my needle wouldn't clog with grounds and to reduce flavor carryover.)

My last single-serve model, in discontinued Poppy Red (to indicate how ""old"" this was) was getting noticeably louder as it was heating water, then last week a gasket inside where the water flows into the K-pod holder seemed to give out as it would leak drips of coffee out of the front of my machine. But if I ran a cycle of just water, it wouldn't leak and flowed as it should. If I'd stick a fresh K-pod in there, and it'd go back to dripping coffee out of the front with a weak stream of coffee coming out of the K-pod holder that tasted not right.

I got tired of cleaning up the mess every morning and ordered the single-serve model in Evergreen. After a nightmare experience with Amazon's Prime Deal Days last week, it finally got delivered today. It is eerily quiet and dispenses steaming water immediately, before the reservoir is even empty. **Is that normal?** The water seems hotter than my previous model but it hasn't emptied into a K-pod, as I haven't tried coffee with it yet since it got delivered so late today.",1,1760215240.0,keurig,0,1.0,False

It was equated to sexual harassment and frequently the comments escalated to the next steps would be  stalking, rape and murder.

According to these posts,  men should never ask a woman out at:

 the gym, she is just trying to decompress and exercise

in a store, she just wants to get her shopping done and go home, 

in line at the coffee shop

at a bar when she just wants to hang out with her friends

outdoors at the park/when walking the dog/beach

 at the woman's job, especially if she is a waitress, cashier or salesperson 

The waitress/cashier I can see being problematic.

The only way, to me, would be politely asking at the end of the transaction and preferably,  giving the lady the guys contact information. 

It seems like there isn't anywhere that a man can talk to a woman and let her know her would be interested in getting to know het better. 

My girlfriends are always complaining that they can never meet men. My guy friends are complaining about how hard it is to meet women.  Good luck trying to get them to attend a party,  let alone to talk  together in the same room at a party.

Assuming normal interactions, including politely refusing, accepting rejection with grace etc, it ever ok for a guy to chat up a girl? If not, how are they supposed to meet?

Is it recoverable?,"I am looking for perspective on emotional cheating and whether I should stay or leave her.

Quick backstory, because I know people probably don't really care:  
We've been together for 5 years. I'm 22, she is 21. We've had ups and downs. I am a small business owner and am VERY stressed out VERY often and have not been giving her as much love and attention as I should be. Recently (as of like a month ago), I have gotten better and learned to manage my stress and I am now giving her everything she asked for and MORE. I may have been too late:

She met a guy (lets call him ""Jay"") at her CrossFit gym, and they got very close very fast. This is completely out of her character, as 2 months ago she would claim that she could never be friends with another guy and that men are disgusting.

I kind of understand why she made friends all of the sudden. She was always very shy yet *wanted* to make friends. She met a girl at the gym at first and became very close with her, which sparked her branching out to others. Honestly, I'm happy for her: I *want* her to have friends. I am very busy and can't give her as much time as she wants from me so I am glad that she is branching out. We had been struggling a bit more than normal because of this.

I am not, on the other hand, comfortable with her have *close* male friends. I know that that might sound toxic, but I also know the nature of man and I don't want her to be close to someone that will bang her given the chance. Keyword here is ""close""; I'm happy with her being friendly but definitely not happy with how far this has gone.

Because she started branching out, she started doing acro yoga. At first it was just with her girl best friend, and then she came home the next day and told me that she just did acro with another dude (not jay, but instead a coach at the gym). I told her that I wasn't really okay with other men having their hands on her, but I had met this coach and he seemed like a decent guy so I told her it was fine as long as she was 1000% transparent with EVERYTHING in the future, though please don't take it any further. This is where Jay comes in:

A couple of days later she posted on her Instagram story a video of her doing acro with another guy. I confronted her about it, and she basically told me that she made a new friend at an acro class and that she would like to do acro with him in the future. I begrudgingly said that it was fine (my first mistake). Over the course of the next couple of weeks, she got very close with Jay. Here is a bit of a timeline for you:

\-Jay asks her if she wants to do a CrossFit competition with her. Teams of 2, one male one female. This competition means that she will have to train with him EVERY DAY for 3+ hours. She says yes, trains with him one night, and then comes home and asks me if its okay if she does this competition (without telling me that she already started training with him). I say YES, but I know deep down I am not comfortable with it. She reassures my by telling me that her girl friend will always be training with them so it won't just be her and Jay.

\-She starts getting very friendly with him, bringing him coffees when they work out in the morning and he starts bringing her food sometimes. When they work out at night, it goes late into the night. The gym is open 24/7 as an open gym so she comes home sometimes at 10:00 PM or later. I imagine they are the only people at the gym at that hour. She agrees to let me login to her instagram: They text often, mostly playful stuff; though he definitely is flirting with her a bit (testing the waters). According to her, he knows that she has a boyfriend.

\-They go on a run (just the two of them) together and then do their workouts together. He posts a video of them doing acro together and when I saw it it made me want to throw up. She and him are laughing and smiling (she doesn't smile like that for me anymore) and playfully touching each other. She then gets home at 10:00 PM that night.

\-I find out that she had a talk with him about OUR relationship and the problems we are having. She didn't tell me about this earlier. We had a big breakout fight and she tells me that he is ""just a friend"", that ""i don't understand the situation"", and that ""she is finally happy and she finally has friends and now I want to take them away from her"". According to her, she was talking to her girl best friend and he interjected. I don't think the conversation including him lasted very long, but he gave her mostly helpful advice: telling her to write a note to me and tell me how you really feel. She promises me from this point forward she will be 1000% transparent.

\-She tells me that she has been delaying coming home to me because she doesn't want to deal with the stresses and the problems in our relationship so she chooses to stay longer at the gym instead.

\-A few days pass and I finally tell her that I don't want her and Jay doing acro yoga together. It is too intimate of a sport for her to be doing with another man that I feel intimidated by. She agrees, although goes to CrossFit that night and ended up doing acro with him anyways. She tells me as soon as she gets home, which I appreciate, and explains that one of the coaches wanted to get some cool shots of them doing it with a drone he just got and she felt bad for turning him down.

\-Fast forward to last night, and this was the straw that broke the camels back:  
I caught her deleting messages between the two of them. I saw the messages beforehand, and they were genuinely innocent. When I confronted her about it, she told me that she thought that I would find them too friendly and deleted them to protect me. I worry that this means there have been other deleted messages in the past. She claims there hasn't been, but I don't know if I can believe her.

I broke up with her last night. This is 100% an emotional affair which I assume will lead to physical (if it hasn't happened yet). She claims that she would never cheat on me and that she doesn't find him attractive in the slightest, yet I've lost all trust for her and I don't know if I can believe her.

She is begging me to take her back: saying that she will literally quit CrossFit (which I would never make her do) and we will go to couples therapy. I am considering it. I am literally in love with this girl. I have been for 5 years. I don't want this to go away.

Though on the other hand, I am relieved: maybe this is a good chance for me to put my head down and grow my business.

I am so lost. I want her back so badly. I genuinely don't think I can live without her. I have depression and I have been very suicidal lately. I think about ending it very often.

**TLDR:**  
Girlfriend became very close with a guy from her gym and started doing acro yoga with him which developed into an emotional affair. I broke up with her, yet I am considering taking her back.",10,1760215105.0,relationship_advice,23,0.73,False

In the summer, there was flirting, walks, we went to restaurants, and once we even held hands, and he was the one who initiated it! he interlaced his fingers with mine, but it only lasted for a minute; no intimacy, no kisses, no hugs. He gave me a ride home in his car about 10 times. I want to understand, am I really just an ego booster for him? Please don't judge. 
So, in the summer, when I couldn't take the tension anymore, I suggested he come over to my place sometime to see the renovations, the chandeliers, once I move in. He kind of deftly changed the subject, like, ""Why look, you already like them, you've already hung them"" The next day, he unexpectedly said to me: ""there are some people you can simply admire, you don't necessarily have to use them"" and he points at me. He continued, ""These beautiful people are a stimulus for life! I never understood how one could obsess over just one person. If you feel it's not mutual, let the person go, wish them all the best and release them... You will still have everything in life, you will meet someone a thousand times better!""

Then, in the following days, I tried to get to the truth, asking, ""What was all that for? Why did you do it?"". And he pretended not to understand what I was talking about. 
Somehow, since August, we've drifted apart. 

Now, in October, he's become more attentive again, gives me compliments, like ""you've lost weight, you have long legs, flat tummy"" and has started touching me more often 
(specifically my thighs for some reason - he'll put his palm on my thigh for 1-2 seconds, or poke my knee with his finger a few times, he might take my arm above the elbow on the inside and kind of press against my bra with the back of his hand - also quickly).

Last week he invited me to a cafe, we had coffee, but we talked mostly just about my research. On the way out, he unexpectedly took me by the waist and lightly pulled me towards him quickly. 
Yesterday he asked me why I wasn't wearing the perfume he likes. I said I'd run out, and he offered to buy it for me. Also yesterday, he suggested going to a cafe again, but I refused.

Yesterday, while we were riding the escalator in the metro close to each other, he asked me a question: ""Do you feel how people feel about you?"" 
I answered, ""Yes, but maybe I'm often mistaken."" 
He asked, ""Do you feel when people care about you?"" 
I asked him in return, ""Do you want to take care of me?"" And he said yes. 
We rode in the metro car together, and when saying goodbye, he put his palm on my thigh again for 1-2 seconds.

The reason I'm wary of him now is because before this, he often said that I might make things up, that I misunderstand people's behavior (I guess he wanted to convince me that everything that happened between us was in my head). 
Also, we often argue, not seriously, mostly because of my feeling that he is exploiting me academically. I don't understand if I'm imagining it or not.

The last time, I provoked him (I really liked it), he even said somewhat irritably, ""I so want to scold you... you like getting a rise out of me. Your future husband will have to be very calm”. 
I answered him that yes, I like getting a rise out of him, and I told him that my husband will be lucky because not everyone likes a calm, measured life, and we will ride roller coasters and enjoy it. He smiled.

I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WANTS FROM ME. I like him a lot, I understand it's toxic, but I feel that we are both spinning from these unspoken emotions. Experienced men, please tell me, does he really feel something for me, or am I just his toy?",3,1760215028.0,OlderMan,3,0.81,False

I've also added some structure, holes etc. into the wood to make it look weathered.

The stain didnt work out too well as it turned more into a light coffee brown, but I thought that I can fix it. So I wanted to find a way to darken the textures (crevices, holes etc.) while ""bleaching"" the surface of the wood, to resemble natural driftwood. 

So on a test strip I've tried out antique wax to darken the texture and then add some diluted chalk paint on top, once its dried. It does turn out nicely, but after a couple of hours it turns completely green! The wax and the paint alone arent the problem and dont seem to react with the wood too much (still a bit though), but together they turn hideous. 

I'm a bit lost now, as I dont know how to achieve my idea as the green always gets in my way when experimenting with colors. 

I've also saving it with a grey stain and adding the diluted paint on top, but that brings me to the next problem:  
Cause I dont know how to seal the wood without darkening it again and bringing out the warm coffee tone, as the last layer of chalk paint (which makes it grey and unsaturated) probably cant stay unsealed 😩 Do you have ideas?

1o45ycv,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrimarchGFs/comments/1o45ycv/squires_fortune_of_love/,Squire’s Fortune of Love.,"Alas, Hathor and Sanguinia still have to wait. So here’s Leona and Squire, instead. Perhaps this can shed off the cold exterior of our Lioness.

———————————————————————————

Within the confines of the sparring ring, Leona El’Jonson clashed blades with her stepfather. Squire hadn’t been around to be Leona’s usual sparring opponent, so the Lioness settled to train with Lover in place of her husband. It still surprised Leona how her father, for all his silliness along with his more diminutive stature, still managed to keep up with her while sparring. But Leona could tell that Lover wasn’t really trying to win, and was more than happy to let his daughter win each sparring match. “Lord-Father, I cannot sharpen my skills if you keep letting me win.” Leona stated to her father as she pulled him to his feet. Lover rolled his eyes, “And how many times do I have to tell you to just call me father. I may be the Emperor according to my marriage to your mother, but that doesn’t mean my children need to call my Lord.”

“It’s to show you the dignity and respect that you deserve, Lord-Father.” Leona responded. “Leona, I’m just your stepfather. You never called your foster father lord, and do you ever refer to Squire as Lord-Husband?” Leona’s heart stopped for a moment as she knew Lover was right. But also because she was wanting to see her Brave Warrior, but she last heard him having to perform some duties with Starlight. “No. I didn’t call my foster father lord. And I don’t call my Squire…my…Lord-Husband.” Leona’s voice broke at mentioning Squire, with Lover taking notice of his daughter’s less confident tone in her voice. “Why don’t you go to him. Clearly you miss him.” Lover suggested, though Leona could detect that her father was also ordering her to take such an action.

Leona had never been the most kindly to receiving instruction from Lover. But she had learned that Lover’s instruction was to berate her, but rather to encourage her to soften her cold attitude. “Of course. I’ll go to him Lor…I-I mean, father.” Leona corrected herself. “Well since you mentioned that, father. I actually need to bring Leona to see Squire.” A voice came from behind the Lioness, prompting Leona to turn around to see Magnolia the Red. Magnolia wore her smile she often wore when around her sisters, something Leona always found to be irritating to see on her Sorceress sibling, the one whom was always so busy pursuing knowledge, ever thought to always smile to her siblings.

“What do you mean you need to take me to see Squire?” Leona asked her sister. Lover stepped in at that moment, “Leona. Just go with your sister. If she knows where he is, then you can go with her to see him.” Lover’s voice sounded calm yet stern enough to make Leona listen. “O…Okay, father.” Leona said in defeat as she followed Magnolia. “So what’s this all about, Magnolia?” Leona asked, then a portal emerged before the two siblings. “Follow me. I’ll explain in greater detail on the other side.” Magnolia promised before stepping through. While the Lioness didn’t step through, she knew where to find her sister. ‘I need to practice my forest walking, anyway.’ Leona thought to herself before disappearing into the ghostly forest appearing as Caliban.

Once she emerged from the forest, Magnolia was shocked as her sister’s teleportation. “Before you ask. I’ve only fairly recently been learning the full extent of my power.” Leona stated. Magnolia nodded in understanding, “Well…stay quiet now. They’re about to start.” Magnolia mentioned from Leona to look around an archway she was standing near, with the Lioness peaking around to see Squire, without his armor or sword, sitting stiffly in a chair with Aurelia on the other side of the table. Leona noticed a crystal ball in the middle of the table, making her usually dormant curiosity spring up. “So Squire. The rules are simple. I will ask you questions regarding your relationship with my sister. Answer all of them truthfully, and you’ll be given a reward. Answer any one question with a lie, and you’ll won’t get the reward. Any questions before we get started?” Aurelia asked.

“No. Other than…what is the reward?” Squire asked. “Well I’m sorry, but…you’ll have to wait after the game to see what it is. But don’t worry. I’ve made sure to pick out a good gift for you and Leona.” Aurelia assured her sister’s husband, with Squire simply nodding. Though Leona noticed her husband wearing a smile on his face, which out of all of her sister’s husbands, Squire was the one who smiled the least due to Leona’s harsh training, though he still smiled more than his wife. “Perfect! Let’s get started. First question. Describe her with four words.” Aurelia’s voice chirped as she asked the first question. Squire didn’t waste time thinking, “Noble……Cold. Brave. Secretive.” While the crystal showed the Squire wasn’t lying, his words offered little solace to Leona. “Though she doesn’t show it to any of you. She cares about me…in a subtle way.” Squire added, making Leona smile to herself.

Aurelia still wore a bright smile as she continued, “What is her favorite food or drink?” This almost made Squire burst out with laughter, “Uhhhh…well for food…it’s Roast Beef. For drink…it’s actually coffee and tea.” Aurelia almost spit up some tea she was drinking as she tried not to choke on her drink from laughing. Leona’s cheeks burned red with a mix of anger and embarrassment, as she never appeared to be the type that enjoyed coffee or tea, but she remembered how often she’d drink coffee to warm herself. Coffee that Squire always made specially for her. “Next question. What is your favorite part of her?” Aurelia’s voice chirped up, refocusing Leona’s attention.

Squire’s smile wavered as he struggled to think of an answer. Leona couldn’t understand why she was surprised at her husband not having an immediate answer. After all, Leona hadn’t been the best partner to Squire, and while her cold demeanor had lightened in more recent time, Leona still displayed such character toward her husband in a certain manner. “Ummmm…uhhhh…” Squire stammered as he tried finding an answer, making Leona’s heart crack and break from the idea that her husband didn’t like any part of her. “I-I know I don’t sound to certain of this but…her bravery. And sword skill. And willingness to change. For me.” Squire’s words broke Leona into tears, with Aurelia smiling at her brother-in-law finally finding what he loved most about Leona. “Well. I suspect that there’s a deeper issue with how hard it appeared for you to answer.” Aurelia prompted.

Squire nodded, “Yes. It’s her…cold and ruthless attitude. Even after all the time we’ve spent together, her cold persona still makes me think she doesn’t want me. Or she finds me to be an annoyance rather than her husband.” Leona felt ready to storm into the room and scream at  Squire for not realizing she loved him. But she refrained as she knew he was right to feel that way, “Next question. What is your favorite physical part of her?” Aurelia continued. Unlike the other boys, Squire didn’t blush at this question, “That’s easy. Her hair. Her…beautiful and soft golden hair. She never admits it, but she wears a cute smile once I finish brushing it.” Squire’s smile returned, with Leona’s own smile edging onto her own face. “I-It’s true. I…I never admit it but I do smile after he’s finished.” Leona whispered to Magnolia as much as to herself. This information made the Red Giantess hold back a laugh to avoid from Squire discovering her and Leon. “Awwwww. That’s cute!” Aurelia’s voice sounded like a teenaged fangirl, making Squire blush in embarrassment. 

“But now. The last question. If you can, what was the greatest thing she ever did for you?” Aurelia asked the final question, making Leona’s heart sink. But Squire defied expectations as he answered, “When she told me that she truly loved me.” The answer was short, but still sweet enough for Leona. “And it’s still the truth!” Leona called out as she snatched Squire out of his chair and into a hug. Aurelia smirked at this frankly unheard of display of affection from Leona, even as the two burst into tears while saying how much they loved each other. Squire didn’t bother asking if Leona heard everything as this foreign reaction from his wife was all he needed to know that she heard everything. “Thank you, Leona.” “Thank you? For what?” The Primarch of the First asked. Squire smiled, “Thank you for showing that you care.” He answered.

“Alright you two love birds, here’s your reward.” Aurelia interjected as she brought up a large chest. Upon opening the chest, inside was a collection of scented candles, “H-How did you know I liked candles?” Leona asked. “Squire told my Little Light, who in turn, told me.” Leona glared down at her husband, “You said you were going to keep that a secret between the two of us!” Squire didn’t hear the end of it until the end of the day when he managed to get Leona to snuggle up with him in bed, with some of the new candles burning in their room.

1o45x40,https://i.redd.it/kyuhbl5eljuf1.jpeg,How I became an illustrator,"Hey there,  
Grab a cozy cup of coffee (or tea!) and join me for a little story—how I became a children's book illustrator.

Before you imagine art schools or fancy studios… nope. 😄 When I started, I had:

* No art education, No fancy equipment, No professional contacts, No experience, No clue what I was doing

Just a love for drawing, a big dream, and a lot of curiosity.

And now, after 7 years, I’ve illustrated over 70 children’s books!  
Each one still feels like a tiny miracle. 💛

**I’ve been drawing since a toddler time**: paper dolls, sketchbooks, doodles during class… but it was always just a hobby. Life happened, I got busy, and put my pencils aside.

Then I became a mom, and that changed everything. I started drawing cute animals and little scenes for my kids. I always love reading picture books with them every night. I found myself studying the illustrations, diving into pages and thinking: “Could I maybe… do something like this?”

**So one day, I decided to try.** Just for fun. I started posting some of my drawings online.  
Nothing fancy — just what I had. And then came the big discovery: there were Facebook groups for children’s book authors and illustrators! I still remember how surprised I was 😄

I joined, shared a few pieces, commented here and there—and to my absolute shock, someone reached out asking about my illustration services. I couldn’t believe it. Someone wanted me to illustrate their book!

That was the moment everything changed. One project led to another, and it just started rolling, like a snowball. Bigger and faster than I ever expected. It’s amazing what can happen when you keep showing up for your dream!

**However!** It didn’t happen overnight—not even close. So please, don’t put too much pressure on yourself. Becoming a full-time illustrator takes time.

In the beginning (and honestly, sometimes for quite a while), there’s this strange time where you’re juggling your “old” job with your creative dreams. You’re trying to find that balance between what’s already part of your life and what you hope your life could become. It can feel messy, uncertain, and yes, sometimes completely exhausting.

There will be ups and downs (there still are, even when you become a super-experienced illustrator!). There will be rejections—maybe even a few in a row.

But becoming an artist is a process. A wonderful, sometimes bittersweet, always meaningful process. And it’s worth every step.

Here are some little lessons I’ve learned along the way—take them or leave them, but I hope they help you on your journey:

* **Be kind, patient, and helpful.** Every author is unique. Even if you’ve worked on dozens of books, remember that for many authors, it might be their very first. Treat each project with care, respect, and attention.
* **Pay attention to every detail.** From sketches to layouts to colors, each tiny choice affects the final story. Details matter, and your thoughtful touch makes all the difference.
* **Keep improving your skills.** Try to level up your drawing a little bit every day. Experiment, practice, and challenge yourself—growth happens gradually, but consistently.
* **Share your journey.** There’s always someone new, overwhelmed, or unsure who could use a little encouragement. By sharing your experiences, you might be the light that helps them move forward.
* **Be wise with contracts.** Always read everything carefully and make sure you understand what you’re signing. Know the meaning of each sentence and don’t be afraid to ask questions — it’s better to be safe than sorry.
* **Create fair, balanced, and joyful relationships.** Aim for win-win collaborations. Treat your partners with respect, communicate openly, and keep the process enjoyable for everyone.
* **Handle criticism wisely.** Don’t take harsh feedback personally, but do consider if there’s something useful to learn from it. Every piece of constructive insight can help you improve.
* **Don’t rush your art.** Quality takes time. Even if no one else notices, you will know if something isn’t your best work. Take the time you need to make your art shine.
* **Know your worth.** Pricing is tricky, but stay true to yourself. Ask what feels fair for your time, skill, and effort—don’t undervalue your work.

Becoming an illustrator isn’t an easy path. It’s a mix of magic, mistakes, and growth. And after all those books, I still feel grateful for each one story.

I’d love to hear your story too!",5,1760214539.0,childrensbooks,4,0.78,False

Is this even a viable business?,"Hi guys, this a throwaway account but I’m still fairly new to Reddit and have never actually posted so I’m hoping I’m doing this right.

I am soon 18 in the next couple days and I’ve had this idea lurking in the back of my mind since the start of the year. The idea is to start a business where people can rent rooms for the purpose of entertainment, as in they can use the room to watch TV, play games with rented equipment I would supply and enjoy time with friends. This is the basic version of what I envision, I’d like to make this into something where the attraction isn’t only the room but like a bar set up with tables in the main area where I can host game nights, karaoke, serve drinks and food etc but I need to start small to see if people would even want to pay for this so definitely just start with the room renting idea.

In theory I have a pretty good idea on how I would make this happen but I have no idea how to start. I have Eu Portuguese passport and citizenship, is the UK even the best place to start a business like this? I think it is idk. What type of space do I rent? I’ve had people tell me I can maybe talk to community centres or shops with basements and see if I can strike an accord where I give them a percentage of my earnings. Would this be a good idea? Would anyone even agree on doing this? I’ve thought this through so much but I feel at a loss but I really wanna make it happen. I understand my idea isn’t particularly revolutionary but I live in the north of England and everyday I feel like other coffee shops there is a serious lack of third spaces where specially young people can go and actually choose what they want to do.

I’m currently doing an apprenticeship that pays rather well for my age in a promising field so there’s some money there. I’ve also told the idea to my family who are very hard workers and they were very supportive said they’ll help however they can. We are definitely not rich and have actually struggled financially quite a bit and often but I feel like we’ll be able to pull some cash together if this is something that could actually work.

I’ve looked at all the legal stuff needed and it seems doable. My family already has a personal accountant so that’s something checked out the list. I honestly just want opinions and constructive realistic critiques (I know there tend to be some debby downers on this app) but I’m open to being told this a stupid idea so that I can at least put my mind to rest but I’ll be even happier if I’m told this may actually work lol. I definitely didn’t explain the idea as well I wish I could but i just have so many ideas on this that I forced myself to compact it and simplify it

I hope this reaches as many people as possible, and    I’m able to find clarity✌️.",0,1760214390.0,Investors,0,0.5,False

I currently have a Sage Barista Pro. I want to upgrade the grinder.

I manually weight my beans for each cup, single dose. I only make espresso. I buy 250g coffee bags and usually change to different types of beans each week.

The 3 grinders I'm looking at are basically all in the same price range and easy to get in Europe. Niche Zero is in the UK and more expensive, not sure if it's worth the price bump.

DF64 Gen2  
Eureka Mignon Specialtia  
Eureka Mignon Zero

Willing to bump up 100EUR if the Niche Zero really is worth the upgrade over the other 3.

The Mignon Specialtia seems like a great machine, but apparently not great for single dose and for changing beans weekly? Leaning towards the DF64 Gen 2, but it has a large foot print and is quite deep, also a bit loud (not the biggest issue).

I am just concerned about her health. I also might ramble because I want to be sensitive about this and am trying to collect my thoughts.

I would like to preface this by saying that she has an autoimmune condition that prevents her from eating certain foods all together (like high FODMAP foods) and other food cause discomfort. The menu is pretty limited. She was somewhat recently (wrongly) prescribed a steroid which resulted in some weight gain. With that came self confidence issues and anxiety about it. I also understand this condition is coupled with a high suicide rate.

Now I want to say, I am not the peak image of health but I try my best to follow a decent diet and exercise plan. I get my daily doses of greens and proteins and go for walks in the morning/evening when I can fit it in.

We’ve been dating about 2 years now, so I’ve been able to observe her eating patterns and such. One thing I’ve noticed is the amount of sugar she takes in. Every day starts with a large one of those fruity tea drinks from the coffee place that also sells donuts. Like we cannot do ANYTHING until that drink is acquired. I like a breakfast date, so if we do that, it’s something like chocolate chip pancakes. Then, there’s always some kind of iced tea or lemonade during the day. Cap it off with a cookie or ice cream at the end of the day.

She also does not exercise. She used to be a very athletic person, loved to compete, all that. She gets a twinkle in her eye when she talks about the sports she used to do, but she doesn’t care to get back into anything. 

I understand that some will point to depression which is true and she is in therapy. As far as the food is concerned, I understand that these things are likely easy for her to eat and don’t cause much physical pain, but I can already see that it’s becoming a cyclical process of feeling ill, eating whatever will stay down, gaining weight, and then feeling down emotionally which causes her to feel physically ill. Same thing with exercising, she’ll think about it, not be able to, get upset, etc.

I just want her to be happy and healthy, but I don’t know how to broach the subject. ",1,1760214067.0,relationship_advice,13,0.55,False

London in summer smelled like wet pavement and second chances.
Alma knew it wasn’t the romantic version of the city people dreamed of; it was the real one — full of late trains, lukewarm tea, and polite indifference.
But she liked it that way. The chaos made sense.
Gemma had warned her earlier that morning, over coffee and gossip.
“He’s going to be there, you know.”
Alma rolled her eyes. “It’s a public talk, Gemma. Half the publishing world will be there.”
“Half the publishing world… and Jack.”
That last part landed like a tiny explosion.
She had known, of course. She’d read the email, seen his name on the panel list — Jack Collins, author, keynote speaker.
Still, hearing it said aloud made it real.
“Relax,” Gemma added with her half-British, half-Hong Kong calm. “You’re both adults now. You can handle a bit of nostalgia.”
Alma laughed nervously. “Nostalgia is British for bad ideas.”

The event was exactly what Alma expected: too many people pretending to listen, too many glasses of cheap prosecco.
She was halfway through a polite conversation about “the future of digital publishing” when she heard a familiar voice — deeper, slightly rougher, but still unmistakable.
“Alma?”
She turned, slowly.
There he was. Jack Collins.
Same crooked smile, same impossible mix of confidence and exhaustion.
Twelve years older than when she’d last seen him, and somehow still magnetic in that disheveled, writerly way.
“Hi,” she managed to say, as if her pulse wasn’t betraying her.
“Hi yourself.”
For a second, neither spoke. The air between them was charged with everything unsaid — the book, the distance, the quiet years.
Gemma raised her glass from across the room, mouthing a silent “good luck.”

They ended up sitting next to each other during the panel, exchanging glances that said more than the speakers on stage.
When it was over, Jack leaned toward her.
“Walk with me?”
Alma hesitated for a second, then nodded.

🌙 Part II
They left the restaurant between laughter and half-empty glasses, like two people escaping a party they were never supposed to attend.
The night air smelled like pending rain and spilled networking wine.
“Where are you taking me?” Alma asked, trying to sound casual.
“Somewhere people don’t say ‘synergy.’”
“That place doesn’t exist in London.”
“Then we’ll invent it.”
They walked along the Thames, the lights shimmering on the water as if the city were trying to look prettier for them.
Jack kept his hands in his pockets — an old habit, familiar enough to sting.
“You still hate social dinners.”
“And you still survive them pretending you like them.”
“Old habits.”
“Bad translations.”
Jack chuckled.
“So, translator at Condé Nast? Sounds fancy.”
“It sounds. In reality, it’s turning passive-aggressive emails into elegant prose.”
“That’s heroic.”
“And you? Still writing books that ruin people’s emotional stability?”
Jack glanced at her sideways.
“You really know how to twist the knife.”
“I’m Mexican. Irony is self-defense.”
He stopped in front of a tiny bar with hanging lights and wobbly tables.
“Here. Good wine, and no one recognizes me.”
“Is that a good thing or a sad one?”
“Depends on the bottle.”
They ordered a bottle of red. The waiter smiled at them — the ‘these two definitely have history’ kind of smile.
Alma swirled her wine.
“So… the book.”
Jack sighed.
“I knew we’d get to that.”
“Of course. It’s like a ghost ex — you talk about it or it haunts you.”
Jack leaned forward.
“I never meant to hurt you, Alma.”
“You did anyway.”
“It was clumsy, not cruel.”
“Uh-huh.”
“It was a story I needed to tell.”
“And did it need my dialogue word for word?”
“It was good.”
“It was mine.”
They both went quiet for a second — the kind of silence that tastes like laughter and heartbreak at the same time.
Jack finally broke it with a theatrical sigh.
“For what it’s worth, half the reviews hated that chapter.”
“That almost reconciles me with critics.”
“The other half said it was the best thing I’ve ever written.”
“Never mind, I take it back.”
He smiled, defeated.
“I missed this.”
“Arguing?”
“Hearing you.”
She looked up.
“Don’t say nice things, I’m immune.”
“No. You just pretend you are.”
Alma tried to change the subject.
“So what are you doing now?”
“Writing less, traveling more, faking stability.”
“The classic British combo.”
“And you?”
“Translating, surviving, paying rent, faking success.”
“The classic Mexican abroad combo.”
They both laughed, easier now. The tension melted somewhere between the jokes and the wine.
Jack looked at her a long moment.
“Did you ever think of writing to me?”
“Plenty of times.”
“Why didn’t you?”
“Because I couldn’t decide if I wanted to talk to you or sue you for intellectual property.”
He leaned closer, smiling.
“And now?”
“Now I can’t tell if I want to kiss you or proofread you.”
“We can negotiate.”
“I’m not that easy.”
“You never were. That’s why I’m still here.”
She shook her head, half exasperated, half charmed.
“You’re a mess.”
“I’m a writer, it’s in the contract.”
“Well, I hope you’ve written yourself a decent ending this time.”
“Depends on you.”
Alma gave him a long, assessing look — equal parts disbelief and fondness — then laughed.
“My God, you really haven’t changed.”
“Good. You probably wouldn’t like me if I had.”
The waiter brought the check, but neither moved.
Outside, London kept shining — confused, alive, and as imperfectly beautiful as they were.

🌅 Part III (Final)
The wine was gone, and the conversation didn’t need to be.
London hummed softly in the background — alive, indifferent, generous.
Jack looked at her, for once out of words, and Alma realized that was probably the most sincere thing he’d ever done: run out of adjectives.
“What are you thinking?” she asked.
“That for the longest time I thought you were my unfinished story.”
“And now?”
“Now I think you were my original language.”
Alma gave him a tired, amused smile.
“That was cheesy.”
“I know,” he admitted. “But I meant it.”
She leaned forward.
“You don’t have to keep apologizing.”
“I’m not. I’m just saying I’m glad to see you.”
“And I’m glad I don’t want to punch you anymore.”
They both laughed, and the tension turned into something lighter, almost sweet.
Jack moved closer, slowly, as if not to break the spell.
When their lips met, the world didn’t change — it just became easier to live in.
It wasn’t a movie kiss; it was a real one. Warm, a little clumsy, full of half-laughed sighs.
Afterward, she rested her forehead on his shoulder.
“This is what home feels like,” she murmured.
Jack smiled.
“That sounds like a five-star review.”
They walked aimlessly along the river, sharing a lemon ice cream at midnight, arguing over whether Bowie or The Beatles were the better make-out band under streetlights.
From a distance, London let them be.

Two weeks later, the sun dared to come out again — a rare event, almost a blessing.
Jack wrote in the mornings; Alma translated by the window.
Sometimes they argued over who had stolen whose mug or why the neighbor’s cat hated them.
Other times, they just sat in silence, comfortable, like words weren’t always necessary.
Jack would glance up and say,
“You know, I’ve never felt more like an adult than with you.”
“That sounds awful,” she’d reply.
“It is. But in a good way.”
At night they cooked without recipes, laughed at their disasters, and ended up dancing barefoot between dirty plates and cheap wine.
It was simple, chaotic, and completely theirs.
One morning, Alma found a sheet of paper on his desk with a single handwritten line:
“I finally learned not to translate you.”
She folded it carefully and tucked it into a book.
Then she smiled.
Because for the first time in years, she didn’t need to understand everything to feel at home.

1o45md3,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1o45md3/direct_report_dissociates_from_reality/,Direct report dissociates from reality?,"This is a long one sorry!

So I've been managing roughly 40 employees for just under a year. I work in public services, the people I manage have interactions with members of public pretty much all day, every day. I am office-based. The person I'm struggling with joined about a month after I became a manager. Everything below is a regression of behaviour, she hasn't always been like this.

She has had a history of questionable behaviour at work, my manager, their manager, and HR are fully aware of it all. But to keep it brief I'll just refer to things that happened today. 

She burst into the (open plan) office for her lunch break and interrupted a conversation I was having with another employee. She was complaining about how slow another colleague was walking and how unfair it was on her. I asked her why she was walking off as she was supposed to stay in sight of her colleague. She then started rambling about how she really wanted water and that she's entitled to water, it's a human right, no one can stop her from having water etc. (For the record, employees are permitted to carry water bottles). I agreed and asked if she'd told her colleague that she really wanted some water ASAP, she said she had not. I advised her to communicate with her colleague so they can understand if there's a need to pick up walking pace. She then told me I was being unreasonable, that I was preventing her from having water, having lunch, it's a human right yadda yadda. While she was talking she was hiding her work equipment in random places like on my desk and behind charging blocks.

I asked her to come to a private office to speak with me because she was making quite a spectacle of herself in front of everyone else on break. She said she wanted water first and of course I told her to have some water and then come upstairs for a quick chat. I can't understate how many times she repeated the sentiment that water is a human right, she can't believe how horrible I am for withholding water from her, tears were welling up, heavy breathing etc. I had to repeat several times that I literally was not doing that. 

The only way I could talk her out of this spiral was reassuring her I was asking questions out of concern and that I wanted to check that she was okay as she seemed quite stressed (dysregulated). Then closed the conversation by asking her what was for lunch. She told me she hadn't had breakfast so I gave her some of my snacks and a coffee sachet. 

Later, she spoke to another colleague and asked them if they were pissed off with her after the private conversation she had with me. The colleague in question had no idea what she was talking about. Makes me wonder if she doesn't understand that no one else knows what she's thinking about or knows? Almost like having ""mind/context blindness"" (theory of mind).

She's raised such high concerns that she's been referred to our occ health provider already, just waiting for an appointment. But I've given up on managing the quality of her work because her emotions and behaviour are so erratic. She's quite a burden on the colleague she is paired up with too. 

I will be speaking to my superiors about this when I see them next week. In the meantime, any advice? I'm at my wits end.",3,1760213782.0,managers,10,1.0,False

Plan to daily, autocross, and backroads but also must fit golf clubs/Bicycle. (All of them can either with seats folded or because they have roof rack mounts). I plan to mod, so aftermarket is a plus. 

Pros and cons in my opinion at bottom

Im  looking around on the used market, would ideally like to stay around 20k but anywhere between that and 25k is pretty reasonable. 

I currently drive a Tesla Model Y, even though it has pretty stiff suspension for a daily, taking any sort of corners sucks due to the weight, and it gives me a sort of cringey feeling. 

I’m looking for something that is decently sporty stock (I plan to go on some of these cars and coffee backroads cruises), on top of that I could see myself doing an occasional track day, and more oftenly, autocross events or drag events just for fun. (Drag events less likely since I don’t want to blow a trans or something + it’s not as fun or skill based as the other two.) so aftermarket is a big thing for me, stuff like sway bars, coil overs, maybe extra cooling, tunes etc..

My question is, do I go with something like a higher mileage (looking in carfax, between 50-80k miles) 440i GC, or do I go with something more similar to a golf GTI? I’m not a huge fan of 4cyl, but the size and weight of the golf is appealing. 

TLDR: on the used market around 25k I can get similar mileage Golf GTI S/SE MK8, or 340/440 with B58. Plan to daily, autocross, and backroads but also must fit golf clubs/Bicycle. (All of them can either with seats folded or because they have roof rack mounts). I plan to mod, so aftermarket is a plus. 

Pros of the BMWs: RWD/AWD, B58 = good power + sound, BMW platform has pretty good potential, doesn’t look like a ricer.

Cons: heavier so might take a lot more work to be lots of fun on track or backroads, harder to find in price range

Pros of GTI: Lightweight + Nimble = backroads will be a blast, good aftermarket, DSG is awesome

Cons: not a huge fan of 4cyl in general because it just feels more economy even though I know it’s sporty, FWD means some playfulness is lost, though maybe the weight makes up for it? Lastly, I’m not sure how to look at it, I like how it looks, but I also don’t want to seem like the guy who is still a kid when I’m meeting with clients even though I kind of am.

1o45jpy,https://i.redd.it/pk5kwdoqijuf1.jpeg,Halloween movie night party for young adults in southern Brooklyn,"The Marine Park Young Adults Association is excited to host our Second Annual Halloween Movie Night Party on Friday, October 17th at 5 PM at Marine Park Coffee, located at 3411 Avenue S. This year’s celebration will feature a double horror movie event perfect for spooky season.

We’ll kick off the night with Halloween II (1981), directed by John Carpenter, which is often regarded as the best sequel to the original 1978 classic. The film picks up right where Halloween left off, continuing the terrifying story of “the night he came home” as Michael Myers stalks Haddonfield once more. While suspenseful, Halloween II is considered less frightening than many modern horror films, making it a great entry point for those who want a Halloween scare without being overwhelmed.

Following that, we’ll show Barbarian (2022), a modern horror thriller directed by Zach Cregger, who has recently earned critical acclaim for his new release Weapons. Barbarian is filled with chilling twists and a more intense atmosphere, creating a scarier and more shocking experience compared to the classic slasher style of Halloween II. To make the night flexible and welcoming for everyone, guests are encouraged to come for one or both films — you don’t have to stay for the entire double feature.

To add to the fun, we’ll be awarding a prize for Best Costume, with the winner receiving a gift from a local restaurant chosen by our Board. Attendees can also enjoy free popcorn, candy, and soft drinks throughout the evening.

The event has just a $5 cover fee at the door and is open to young adults ages 18 to 35. Whether you’re a fan of classic slashers, modern horror hits, or just looking for a fun community night out, this event promises to deliver a memorable evening of scares, laughs, and Halloween cheer.

Please reach out to Sam, the President of the Marine Park Young Adults Association, at sam@marineparkyoungadults.org for more information or if you have any questions for the event.",2,1760213596.0,coneyisland,0,1.0,False
