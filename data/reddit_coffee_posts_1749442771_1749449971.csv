Tell me this makes sense to you. The folder hit my desk with a dull thud, scattering paperclips and pushing my cold coffee dangerously close to the edge. I barely blinked. Outside, the Sydney skyline shimmered in silver and blue, a quiet midnight performance for no one. But I wasn’t watching. My eyes were on the police report in front of me, my fingers tracing the timestamp like it might change if I stared long enough. Eleven forty-seven,” I muttered. But the witness statement? Eleven fifteen. A thirty-two-minute gap. Not a clerical error. Not with the way everything else had been handled. I stood, pacing to the window, arms crossed. Below me, traffic lights flicked through their cycle for empty streets. My office, perched on the twenty-fourth floor, might as well have been a spaceship. Quiet. Suspended in air. Alone. The fluorescent lights overhead buzzed like they had a grudge. My fingers itched for something sharper than a pen. I turned back to the desk and snatched up another file—evidence log. “Found” pistol, .38 caliber. But it had turned up in a location outside the search warrant’s parameters. Illegal search. Chain of custody questions. Another puzzle piece that didn’t quite fit.

A breath escaped me, shaky. Not from fatigue, though I was tired. Not from the cold coffee in my gut or the hour on the clock. It was something else.

Something was off.

The file’s subject, Marcus Chen, stared up at me from his booking photo—eyes shadowed, jaw clenched, expression unreadable. Twenty-eight. No priors. Mechanic in Darlinghurst. Not exactly the poster boy for organized crime. Yet somehow, the charges against him screamed “dangerous offender.” Assault. Weapons possession. Gang affiliation.

But the narrative fell apart under scrutiny.

I flipped to the civilian witness statements. Three people. Three different outfits described. Black jacket. Blue shirt. Red cap. The red cap hadn’t even been collected as evidence. How did that detail end up in the report?

More scribbles on my legal pad. I was circling the same holes in the prosecution’s case, but now, the circles were turning into a storm. “Tell me this makes sense to you.” The folder hit my desk with a dull thud, scattering paperclips and pushing my cold coffee dangerously close to the edge.

The case will be there tomorrow. —Ava. I ignored it. Because this case… it wasn’t just a case anymore. It was turning into something else. A challenge. A trap. A test I hadn’t agreed to take. The silence in my office felt dense, like air before a thunderclap. My chair creaked as I dropped into it again, the leather sticky against my skin. I’d been here for hours, chasing ghosts through ink and paper. But now, the pattern was forming. Faint but real. Sloppy police work? No. Deliberate. Constructed. The arrest report called Marcus “uncooperative and hostile.” But the medical records told a different story. Defensive wounds. Bruises consistent with restraint. No injuries on the officers. So who really started the fight?

**Chapter 2**

The suburban police station sat like a concrete fortress against the amber dusk, its parking lot dotted with patrol cars and unmarked sedans. I'd been watching from my Honda Civic for forty-three minutes, parked across the street behind a cluster of eucalyptus trees that provided just enough cover.

My phone was propped against the dashboard, recording through the windshield. The quality wouldn't be perfect, but it would be enough.

Detective Robert Miller emerged from the station's side entrance at exactly 6:47 PM—punctual, just like the pattern I'd observed over the past three days. He glanced around with the casual wariness of someone who knew he was doing something wrong, then walked toward the darkened alley between the station and the adjacent building.

I adjusted my phone's angle, zooming in as much as the camera would allow. Miller stopped beside a dumpster, checking his watch. The orange streetlight cast harsh shadows across his weathered face, highlighting the nervous tick at the corner of his mouth.

A figure emerged from the shadows—thin, wearing a baseball cap pulled low. Even from this distance, even with the grainy footage, I could see the exchange. The stranger pressed something into Miller's palm. Miller's fingers closed around it, and the bulge in his jacket pocket grew slightly larger.

Money. Had to be.

The entire transaction lasted less than fifteen seconds. The stranger melted back into the shadows while Miller returned to the station, his stride more confident now, shoulders relaxed.

I stopped recording, my hands trembling slightly as I lowered the phone. Three days of surveillance had finally paid off. This was the corruption I'd suspected, the reason Marcus Chen's case felt so wrong, so fabricated.

A car door slammed somewhere behind me. I glanced in my rearview mirror and froze.

A black sedan had pulled up fifty yards back, its engine still running. Tinted windows made it impossible to see inside, but the way it sat there—motionless, waiting—sent ice through my veins.

I hadn't noticed it following me. When had it arrived?

My fingers found the ignition, turning the key with deliberate calm. The Honda's engine coughed to life, and I pulled away from the curb at normal speed, fighting every instinct that screamed at me to floor the accelerator.

The sedan followed.

Not immediately—they waited until I reached the first intersection before pulling out. Professional. Careful. Which somehow made it worse.

I took a right onto the main road, then another right into a residential neighborhood. The sedan maintained its distance, never closer than three cars, never farther than five. My palms were slick with sweat as I gripped the steering wheel, mind racing through possibilities.

Had Miller spotted me? Was this connected to Marcus's case? Or had I stumbled into something much larger?

Twenty minutes later, I finally lost them in the maze of one-way streets around Circular Quay, doubling back twice before I was certain the sedan was gone. Only then did I allow myself to breathe normally, to process what I'd captured.

\---

Back in my office, the building's silence felt different now—less comforting, more exposed. I uploaded the footage to my laptop, enhancing the brightness and contrast until the details sharpened.

There. Miller's face, clearly visible under the streetlight. The exchange of what was definitely cash. The stranger's profile as he turned away from the camera.

My heart nearly stopped.

I knew that profile. The sharp jawline, the way he carried himself with predatory confidence.

Julian West.

I'd seen his photo in the background check I'd run on Marcus's known associates. Described in police files as Alexander DeLuca's ""right-hand man,"" though no charges had ever stuck. He was a ghost in the legal system—mentioned in countless reports, suspected of involvement in everything from racketeering to murder, but somehow always just out of reach.

And here he was, paying off the detective investigating Marcus Chen.

I rewound the footage, studying every frame. The envelope Julian passed to Miller was thick—more than a casual bribe. This was systematic, ongoing. How many cases had Miller compromised? How many innocent people were sitting in jail because of this corruption?

My phone buzzed with a text: \*Coffee tomorrow? Need to talk about your case. - Detective Sarah Kim\*

Sarah was my liaison in the police department, one of the few cops I trusted completely. If anyone could help me navigate this, it was her.

I typed back: \*Yes. Usual place, 9 AM.\*

\---

The café on George Street looked like countless others throughout Sydney—cramped tables, industrial lighting, and the perpetual smell of overextracted espresso. I'd chosen it precisely because it was unremarkable, the kind of place where two people could talk without drawing attention.

Sarah was already there when I arrived, hunched over a newspaper with a coffee growing cold beside her. Her usually neat ponytail was disheveled, and dark circles ringed her eyes.

""You look like hell,"" I said, sliding into the booth across from her.

""Thanks. You're a real charmer, Emily."" She folded the newspaper, but I caught a glimpse of the headline: \*GANG VIOLENCE ESCALATES IN SYDNEY'S UNDERWORLD.\*

I pulled out my tablet, the enhanced footage already queued up. ""I need you to see something.""

Sarah glanced around the café—a reflexive cop's check—then leaned forward as I hit play. Her expression shifted from curious to grim as the video progressed. When Julian West appeared on screen, her jaw tightened.

""Jesus, Emily. Where did you get this?""

""I've been watching Miller. Something about Marcus Chen's arrest didn't add up, and now I know why."" I lowered my voice. ""This proves corruption in the investigation. Miller's been bought.""

Sarah was quiet for a long moment, staring at the frozen image of Julian West. Her fingers drummed against the table—another nervous habit I'd learned to recognize.

Her phone rang. She glanced at the caller ID, and her face went pale.

""I have to take this."" She stood abruptly, walking toward the café's entrance.

I watched through the window as she spoke, her posture growing more rigid with each passing second. Whatever was being said on the other end, it wasn't good news.

When she returned, everything had changed. Her eyes wouldn't meet mine, and her voice carried a flat, professional tone I'd never heard before.

""Emily, I think you're overreaching on this case. Sometimes what looks like corruption is just... miscommunication.""

""Miscommunication?"" I stared at her in disbelief. ""Sarah, you just watched a known criminal pay off a detective—""

""I watched a grainy video that could be interpreted many different ways."" She was already gathering her things. ""I'd be careful about making accusations you can't prove.""

She stood, leaving my tablet on the table. As she walked past my seat, she stumbled slightly, her hand brushing against the table.

When I looked down, my tablet was gone.

""Sarah!"" I called after her, but she was already pushing through the café door, not looking back.

I sat alone in the booth, surrounded by the ordinary chatter of other patrons, feeling like the ground had shifted beneath my feet. My evidence—the proof of Miller's corruption, of Julian West's involvement—had vanished along with the one person I'd trusted to help me.

The realization hit me like ice water: I wasn't just fighting a corrupt detective or a defense case gone wrong.

I was fighting something much bigger, something with tentacles reaching into places I'd thought were safe.

And now they knew I was watching.

**Chapter 3**

The knock on my apartment door came at exactly 9:47 PM.

Three sharp raps, deliberate and measured. I froze in my kitchen, a mug of chamomile tea halfway to my lips. No one visited me this late. No one even knew where I lived except—

Another knock, more insistent this time.

I set the mug down with trembling fingers and crept toward the door, my bare feet silent on the hardwood floor. Through the peephole, I saw two men in dark suits standing in the hallway. They weren't looking at the door—they were scanning the corridor with the practiced vigilance of professionals.

Bodyguards.

My blood turned to ice. How had they found my address? How long had they been watching?

""Ms. O'Connor."" The voice came through the door, calm and respectful. ""We need to speak with you.""

I pressed my back against the wall, heart hammering. ""I don't know who you are. Leave, or I'm calling the police.""

A pause. Then: ""We're here for your protection, ma'am. Mr. DeLuca's orders.""

DeLuca. The name hit me like a physical blow. Alexander DeLuca—the mob boss whose empire Marcus Chen was allegedly connected to. The man whose organization Julian West served.

""I don't need protection,"" I called back, my voice steadier than I felt.

""With respect, ma'am, recent events suggest otherwise. We'll be stationed outside your building tonight. Whether you cooperate or not.""

I slumped against the door, the reality of my situation crashing over me. The missing tablet, Sarah's sudden betrayal, the black sedan that had followed me—it was all connected. And now Alexander DeLuca knew exactly who I was and where I lived.

Through the peephole, I watched the two men take positions on either side of my door. They weren't leaving. They weren't asking permission.

I was under protection whether I wanted it or not.

\---

Sleep was impossible. Every creak of the building, every footstep in the hallway, sent adrenaline shooting through my system. At 3 AM, I gave up and made coffee, standing at my kitchen window and staring down at the street below.

A black SUV sat parked across from my building, its occupants invisible behind tinted glass.

By morning, exhaustion had given way to fury. I dressed in my most professional suit—navy blue with sharp lines that made me feel armored—and marched past the two bodyguards without acknowledgment. They fell into step behind me, their presence a constant weight between my shoulder blades.

The address I'd found for Alexander DeLuca led me to Sydney Harbour, where mansions perched on clifftops like predatory birds. His estate sprawled across three acres of manicured lawns and native gardens, the main house a modernist masterpiece of glass and steel that seemed to float above the water.

The gates opened before I could announce myself.

I drove up the winding driveway, my Honda looking pathetically out of place among the Bentleys and Maseratis parked near the entrance. The bodyguards' SUV followed at a respectful distance.

Alexander DeLuca was waiting for me on the front steps.

He was younger than I'd expected—mid-thirties, with dark hair and the kind of sharp-featured handsomeness that belonged on magazine covers. But it was his eyes that stopped me cold. Gray as storm clouds, they held an intelligence that was both calculating and predatory.

He wore a charcoal suit that probably cost more than my monthly rent, the fabric draping his tall frame with casual perfection. Everything about him radiated power and control, from his relaxed posture to the slight smile playing at the corners of his mouth.

""Ms. O'Connor."" His voice was smooth, cultured, with just a hint of an accent I couldn't place. ""Thank you for coming.""

""I didn't have much choice."" I slammed my car door harder than necessary. ""Your men made that clear.""

He descended the steps with fluid grace, stopping just close enough to invade my personal space without quite touching. The scent of expensive cologne mixed with something darker—leather and steel.

""You're angry,"" he observed, tilting his head slightly. ""Good. Anger means you're taking this seriously.""

""Taking what seriously? The fact that you've had me followed? That you've stationed guards outside my home without my consent?""

""The fact that someone tried to kill you yesterday.""

The words hit me like a slap. ""What?""

""The black sedan. You lost them in Circular Quay, but they circled back. Found your car in the parking garage beneath your office building."" His gray eyes never left mine. ""They planted a device under your chassis. Remote detonator.""

My legs nearly gave out. ""You're lying.""

""My people removed it this morning. Would you like to see the photographs?""

The world tilted sideways. Someone had tried to kill me. Actually tried to end my life, and I'd been completely oblivious.

""Why?"" The word came out as barely a whisper.

Alexander's expression softened almost imperceptibly. ""Because you're asking the right questions about the wrong people. Because you have evidence that threatens very powerful interests.""

""The tablet—""

""Is gone, yes. But the damage was already done. They know you're investigating Miller's corruption. They know you've connected Julian to the payments.""

Julian. His own right-hand man.

""You know about Julian,"" I said, studying his face for any tell.

Something flickered in his eyes—pain, maybe, or disappointment. ""I know many things, Ms. O'Connor. Including the fact that you're in danger simply by existing in the same world as these people.""

He turned and walked toward the house, clearly expecting me to follow. After a moment's hesitation, I did.

The interior was as stunning as the exterior—soaring ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the harbour, and artwork that belonged in museums. But it felt cold, impersonal, like a showroom rather than a home.

""Danger finds you,"" he said without turning around, leading me toward what appeared to be a study. ""I remove it.""

""By having me followed? By posting guards at my apartment?""

""By ensuring you survive long enough to realize how deep this goes."" He stopped beside a massive desk, his fingers drumming against its polished surface. ""Tell me, Ms. O'Connor—do you enjoy black-tie events?""

The sudden change of subject threw me. ""What?""

""There's a gala tomorrow night. Downtown warehouse, very exclusive. The kind of gathering where Sydney's most influential people come to see and be seen."" His smile was sharp as a blade. ""You'll be my guest.""

""I'm not going anywhere with you.""

""Yes, you are."" His voice carried absolute certainty. ""Because Julian will be there. Because the people who want you dead will be there. And because it's time you understood exactly what you've stumbled into.""

He moved closer, close enough that I could see the flecks of silver in his gray eyes. ""This isn't a request, Emily. This is survival.""

The way he said my name—intimate, possessive—sent an unwelcome shiver down my spine.

""And if I refuse?""

His smile widened, but it never reached his eyes. ""Then you'll spend the rest of your very short life wondering who's going to try to kill you next.

**Chapter 4**

The warehouse had been transformed into something from a fever dream—crystal chandeliers suspended from industrial beams, marble statues positioned between concrete pillars, and enough flowers to stock a funeral home. The contrast was deliberate, I realized. Beauty imposed on brutality, elegance .........

i am an attractive guy (22M) and i have dated many many people. i am very confident in myself and who i am, and i am never nervous for a date or to talk to women. i have many options for people to go out with & so not many people peak my interest.

i’ve known this girl since high school, but we didn’t talk much then. i’ve always thought she was attractive, but i never made a move on her because i genuinely just thought she was too pretty for me. so if i talked to her it was just friendly, never even went for it.

but recently i decided to make a move with a big leap of impulse and i had no idea it would work. but she actually said she’d go get coffee with me this week, and we’ve been talking regularly for a couple of weeks now!

i’ve become even more attracted to her as we’ve talked. we’re in the same place in life, she’s healthy & confident & knows who she is and what she wants to do with her life. we have a lot in common and similar interests and similar energy. she is my ideal woman and it’s making me get more and more excited yet more and more anxious for our date.

like i said, i know im a very attractive guy and i go on dates all the time. im very confident in my dating & relationship skills & i am NEVER nervous about a date or dating someone. but this girl just keeps getting better & i am feeling nervous for a date for the first time in 5 or 6 years. 

how do i get rid of the nerves? it’s a mix of excited and nervous, but i don’t wanna be awkward or spend our whole date overanalyzing things. she is really awesome and i don’t wanna fuck this up. it’s very confusing for me to feel this way when i never do so some advice would help!!! thank you!!!!",1,1749449842.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

She pours coffee, packs lunches, folds clothes.

so in a couple of hours me (30) will have a first date with a ukrainian girl (24) who has been living in Germany for the last three years. We got to know each other in some dating app and texted a few days and decided to meet up today. Since i will be going 30-40min by train to the small city she lives in close to my big city and i have zero idea about that city she suggested wo go visit some ww2 memorial, a former concentration camp turned museum and just have a stroll in a parc. Good ideas i thought, so i agreed. Now here is the thing:

A few days ago we were talking about favorite foods. She asked me if i like Sushi (i don't) because she ""loves"" it. Yesterday when we were setting up the time and place where to exactly meet today she asked ""Do we go eat Sushi afterwards?""

Now, i am not oblivious to the fact that a lot of eastern european women (especially kind of younger ones and i guess 24 would qualify for that) expect way more than western women to be invited to dinner or lunch basically EVERY time you go out. And also of course it needs to be expensive, because i guess otherwise they think you dont think they are 'worth' it.

My issue is not the money, my issue is the principle. I usually never really go out eating because i find it a waste of money (i have pretty good income, so thats not it) and if i would treat my girlfriend for something relatively expensive as Sushi then it would be for some occasion like her birthday or an anniversary or whatever. But i find it quite disturbing to basically being soft-forced into inviting a girl i basically don't know to one of the most expensive ways of going out for lunch/dinner. When she asked that question my mood already took a dive. Why is it not possible to stay humble and just choose for a first date to let the guy invite you for a nice coffee and a piece of cake or whatever in some cool Café? I get the impression i am set up to being used for a free expensive dinner.

So my question is: How would you guys handle the situation if you still want to meet that girl and check out the general vibe, but also when it will come to this lunch situation to make clear that you really would love to invite her to something to drink and eat but that you find it a bit over the top to have your first date cost you like 60€ for a couple hours of walking and getting to know each other and see whether or not it clicks? Or would you just roll with it, pay for it and then say: Alright, next time it's your turn? Something that suggests you are not that type of guy who is into the whole ""guy pays for everything every time we go out"".

**Intro**  
It was an ordinary Monday morning. The kind that felt forgettably quiet. Trajan sat behind the wheel of his car, halfway through a yawn as he pulled into the school parking lot. The sky was a dull gray, clouds hanging low, smothering any trace of sunlight.

He spotted his friends Titus and River waiting near the main entrance.

**Titus:** “Hey Trajan! Do you have the biology book? If you do, can I quiz you?”  
**Trajan:** “Yeah, sure.”  
**Titus:** “Yay!”

They leaned against a column, joking and quizzing each other. Soon enough, their group arrived—Kaiden with earbuds still in, Maggie balancing an iced coffee, Nana humming a tune, Ziran half-asleep, Muyan yawning, Tony looking grumpy, Fei Fei texting furiously, and Sydney spinning a pen in her fingers.

Kaiden tells Trajan to listen to a **podcast** he is listening to but as he puts the ear pods in his ear the audio changes from the podcast to the song **""Blow""** by **Kesha** and it starts to play and Trajan hears: “**This place about to blow**”.

The bell rang. Everyone scattered toward their respective classrooms.

Trajan, River, Nana, Ziran, and Fei Fei headed into **Crane Class**, while Kaiden, Titus, Maggie, Sydney, Muyan, and Tony made their way to **Leopard Class**.

As they set their bags down, River twisted the cap off her water bottle—and was instantly sprayed in the face.

**River:** “What the heck?”  
She blinked, stunned.  
**River:** “It only does that when the altitude changes… That’s weird.”  
**Trajan:** “Yeah… Huh. Hold up, I’m gonna run to the bathroom.”  
**River:** “Alright.”

Trajan asked to be excused and walked into the boy's bathroom. The smell hit him instantly—urine, mold, and something metallic. Cracked tiles lined the floor, and the light above flickered like it was dying.

After finishing, Trajan flushed and turned on the sink. The knob popped off in his hand, water shooting upward like a fountain. He sighed, wiped his hand on his jeans, and left.

Back in class, a substitute was filling in for advisory. She casually opened a soda can—**fsssHHHH-POP!**—it exploded in a sticky spray, splashing her and several students.

**Substitute:** “Oops! Sorry, class. Hang on, I’ll clean this up.”

She opened the supply closet near the back of the office, rummaging for paper towels. Inside were stacks of canned food, part of a donation drive. What she didn’t notice was the hairline crack in the **gas line** along the back wall, hissing quietly as it leaked into the hallway.

Meanwhile, another teacher in the lounge was about to heat up a cup of instant ramen. As she pressed the microwave button, two **metal paperclips**—knocked in by accident—sat inside the rotating tray.

As chaos quietly brewed, Trajan sat with River and the others, smiling.

**Trajan:** “Hard to believe we’re almost done with school.”  
**Fei Fei:** “I know, right? Just a few more weeks and then—”

**BOOM.**

The explosion rocked the building. A deep rumble shook the walls, sending a ripple of silence across the class. Then the screams started.

Trajan ran into the hallway. Smoke billowed from the **front office**, now fully engulfed in flames. A second blast shattered the windows of the **Chinese Literacy Room**, sending shards of glass flying. One shard embedded into a nearby student’s throat. Blood sprayed as they collapsed, gurgling.

Trajan whipped around toward Crane Class. He saw flames curling from the doorway. Inside, **Ziran** was screaming, her body ablaze, flailing wildly. **Nana** dashed toward her—but as she grabbed Ziran’s arm, a second explosion from under the classroom floor burst upward—**both girls and many others vanished in fire**.

**Fei Fei**, outside in the corridor, ran to pull the fire alarm mounted on the wall—unaware that a **weakened gas pipe** lay behind it. The force of her pull caused the already-bubbling lithium battery inside the alarm to heat up. The alarm sparked.

**BOOM.**

The hallway ceiling collapsed. Beams, bricks, and steel supports **crushed six fleeing students** instantly—one boy's leg twitched beneath the rubble before going still.

From the other end of the hallway, Leopard students poured out, gasping at the chaos. **Kaiden, Titus, Tony, Muyan, Sydney, and Maggie** joined the crowd trying to escape.

**Maggie**, seeing a potential exit by the windows, sprinted ahead. She was only feet away when **a gas pipe embedded inside the wall beside the door exploded**, sending a flaming metal shard straight through her chest. Her body crumpled mid-run, still twitching.

**More screams.** A girl tried climbing over the crowd but slipped and was **trampled**. Another student fell, their **head cracked against a locker**, blood pooling around them. Someone screamed for help but was pulled down by the mob.

Another **detonation** followed—the ceiling above the lockers burst, and a wave of **tables and drawers**, launched like missiles, flew through the smoke-filled air.

 A drawer **hit Muyan's head** with such force it snapped sideways at an unnatural angle, A table **slammed into Sydney**, deforming her face. Their blood sprayed across Trajan and Titus’s faces.

Only a few were left now.  
**Kaiden. Tony. Titus. River. Trajan.**

Tony grabbed Kaiden’s arm, trying to pull him through the smoke—but a door, glowing red-hot, **collapsed on them both**, pinning and crushing their bodies under burning debris.

The fire roared louder, spreading fast. River turned to Trajan.  
**River:** “We have to run—!”

But it was too late.

The final explosion tore through the entire hallway, fed by the accumulated gas. A **white-hot flash** erupted, then **fire engulfed everything**.

**Trajan, River, and Titus** were incinerated instantly—burned away in a blaze that swallowed every remaining sound.

**Trajan gasped.**  
His eyes flew open. His chest heaved like he'd been underwater, lungs straining for air. Sweat clung to his neck. His heart thudded so loudly it drowned out the morning chatter around him.

**River:** “Are you okay?”  
Her voice cut through the haze. She looked at him with concern, tilting her head.

**Trajan:** “I… I saw something. It's... not important.”

But it *was* important. Burned into his mind. Flames. Screams. Death. He didn’t even know if the people standing beside him were real anymore.

They walked in silence toward the classroom. The door opened with a familiar squeak.

Then it happened.

**River twisted the cap off her water bottle—**

**PSSHHHT.** Water sprayed into her face.

**River:** “What the heck?”  
She blinked, drenched.  
**River:** “It only does that when the altitude changes… That’s weird.”

**Trajan froze.** The world tilted around him.  
His breath hitched. **No. No. No.** Not again. This was the dream. It was happening. It was all happening **again.**

**Trajan:** “Wait… No. NO! This place—this building is going to explode. Please! PLEASE GET ME OUT OF HERE! EVACUATE! RIGHT NOW! PLEASE!”

The class turned toward him, stunned. Laughter rippled through the students. Someone muttered, “What’s wrong with this dude?”

The substitute teacher, startled, held up her hand.

**Substitute:** “Now wait a seco—”

**FSSHHHH-POP!**  
The soda can in her hand **exploded**, just like before. Sticky spray everywhere.

**Substitute (startled):** “Oh! Oh no! One second, class, I’ll go grab cleaning supplies.”

She stepped out.

**Trajan spun toward the class.**  
**Trajan:** “Please, you *have* to listen to me! We need to leave. Right now. The gas line is leaking! This place is going to blow up!”

**Most students laughed. Some looked confused.**  
But his *friends*—**River, Fei Fei, Nana, Titus**—saw the panic in his eyes. The sweat on his forehead. The way his hands trembled. They exchanged worried glances.

**River:** “Guys… maybe we should listen to him.”

**Fei Fei:** “I’ve never seen him like this.”

**Titus nodded.** “I don’t know what’s happening, but let’s go.”

**Trajan didn’t wait.** He ran out of the classroom and bolted down the hallway to Leopard, heart pounding like a drum.

He burst in.  
**Trajan:** “PLEASE! You have to get out! You’re all in danger! The school is going to explode!”

**Mr. Wu turned sharply.**  
**Mr. Wu:** “Trajan! Calm down. You need to return to class immediately.”

**Kaiden stepped forward, concern on his face.**  
**Kaiden:** “Mr. Wu… maybe he’s having a panic attack or something. Can we take a few minutes to check on him? Just to be safe?”

**Mr. Wu hesitated**, then sighed. “Only a few minutes. And stay near the building.”

**They exited through the east side door**, Trajan hyperventilating but relieved to see them walking away from the classroom. They were almost in the clear.

That’s when **Ms. Lauren**, a strict faculty member with a clipboard in hand, spotted them from across the field.

**Ms. Lauren:** “What are you doing outside?! This is unauthorized! River, Titus—back inside, now.”

**River:** “No, wait—he’s right, I think something’s wrong—”

But **Ms. Lauren grabbed River’s wrist**, trying to pull her back toward the school doors. Trajan stepped forward to intervene and she exited the building—**right as it happened.**

**BOOOOOM.**

The explosion **ripped through the building**, the fireball bursting out from the side wall with a deafening roar. Windows shattered, debris flew outward, a wave of heat hit them like a punch to the chest. **Ms. Lauren was engulfed instantly**, her clipboard flung through the air like a leaf on fire.

**Ziran**, just outside the building, turned in time to see a wall of glass **explode outward**—and a shard **pierced straight into her eyes and mouth**, she fell, her leg twitching. She didn’t even have time to scream.

**Fei Fei screamed.**  
**River fell backward.**  
**Trajan stared in horror—again.**

It was happening.

All over again.

1l6xd03,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1l6xd03/i_wrote_a_letter_to_my_future_self_and_got_a/,"I wrote a letter to my future self, and got a letter back...","So I should start by saying I’m really not sure what to make of all this. Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve always been more of a Scully than a Mulder. I guess you could chalk that up to my upbringing—my parents were devout atheists, as were most people in my town.

For context, I’m a 37-year-old male from the US (no, I won’t say which state, so don’t ask). My wife and I separated last fall, and so for the past year I’ve been suffering from a malignant case of what I guess you could call “what’s-the-freaking-point.” Most people I’m sure would probably label it a midlife crisis, and if you want to go ahead and call it that too, be my guest. Add a recent job loss into the mix (only a data entry analyst for a local law firm, sure—but still), and you start to get the picture. It’s honestly wild how little it takes for the house of cards you call a life to collapse completely.

Anyway.

Like most people in my position, I turned to self-help books, motivational courses—even reached out to a couple of local therapists (though I never followed through; those sons of bitches are expensive). A lot of it was exactly what you’d expect: visualisation techniques, journaling, and a whole lot of “manifest your future” bullshit—but there was one thing that caught my attention. In one of the books (I won’t name it, but you’ve definitely heard of it), the author recommends writing a letter to your future self—something about “making promises” and “committing to change.” The sort of thing.

So tl;dr—I wrote one. Just scribbled it out, stuffed it in an envelope, and dropped it in the mail. No address. No stamp. Not even sure why I bothered, really.

  
**The following day, I got a letter back.**

I discovered it while returning from my early morning run (another of the author’s recommendations). 

Sweating and still out of breath, I turned it over in my hands, miffed, not sure if it was some kind of joke—and if so, who would even bother. I’ve got few friends, none of whom could be said to have the time or inclination for practical jokes. Hell, I would’ve chalked it up to some local dipshit playing a prank, if not for the contents.

I won’t go into details (after all, it’s personal), but let’s just say it mentioned things that no one else could possibly know—deeply private things, things I’ve never said out loud.

I guess that’s why I decided to write back. 

*—Who is this?*

I should have left it alone—that much is obvious now. But call it morbid curiosity, or just plain ol’ stupidity, I just had to know.

The reply came the very next morning. 

I had just stepped out onto the porch, coffee in hand, when I’d seen the little flag on the mailbox sticking up, and I knew that my mysterious pen-pal had replied. Truthfully, I hadn’t been expecting another letter, having by that point convinced myself that whoever wrote the first one had simply gotten lucky—which seems unbelievable to me now, looking back (although, to be fair, denial is a powerful thing).

This time, however, the letter was different. 

Before, the manner had been cordial—friendly, even. Like the correspondence from an old acquaintance. 

This letter, though… 

I’d stood there by the mailbox, suddenly feeling like I might collapse as I re-read line after line, written in what was unquestionably my own handwriting. 

And the things that it said… the awful, horrible things, things that couldn’t possibly be true, and yet that I somehow knew were just that.

I’d ripped it up right there at the end of my driveway, unsure what was going on, but suddenly furious and—yes, I’ll admit it—afraid. To have a stranger come to your home and hand-mail something of such a personal nature, to be messed with in such a fundamentally personal way… I felt violated.

I didn’t write back. 

Whatever curiosity I’d held regarding the letter was gone, and all I wanted now was to forget the whole thing and move on with my life.

Then, yesterday, I got another one.

This time it was brief. Just a single line:

*See you soon…*

Enclosed with it was a cutout from a newspaper I recognized immediately to be my local.

It’s dated a week from now. 

It’s the obituary page.

*My obituary.*

I’m holding the clipping even as I write this.

*What the hell do I do? Is this real?*

Please. 

The paper says I was found holding a letter…

1l6xc7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/hsp/comments/1l6xc7c/i_kinda_lost_it_at_my_boss_recently/,I kinda lost it at my boss recently…,"A few days ago, I kinda lost it on my boss. Because on multiple occasions I would come in to work and she would be in a mood, and I was tired of walking on eggshells.

When she gets in her moods, she will barely talk, and she will overwork herself regularly and then get really self-righteous about things if you aren’t moving quickly enough or whatever it is. For a long time i put up with it and tried to people please/fawn/ sometimes I would stand up for myself or tell a joke to cut the tension in the air because boy did it get tense sometimes, and sometimes she can completely break out of the spell with a good joke. But this day was different. She was storming around the store, and every time i would talk to my coworker who is assisstant manager, even though we were talking and working at the same time, she would tell us to focus. Well on this day, she didn’t tell us to focus kindly, she went up to my coworker’s ironing board and slammed both hands down abruptly and said “get to work” which rattled me and pissed me off immensely, but my coworker seemed unfazed which also pissed me off because it was one of many times when i realized that he is used to the passive aggressive emotional atmosphere in our workplace. I knew from that point on that she was going to be an ass for the rest of the day because my assistant manager was taking Friday off, after taking multiple days off the week prior and after a very busy work week. So i knew she would want to get stuff done early and I am not very quick at ironing shirts, and historically I am the one who they pick on if things aren’t moving quickly enough Due to not being super fast and also there are multiple other complex reasons why she probably takes our her aggression on me in a passive way.

So its the latter half of the day and she brings me like 20 shirts to ”touch up” or re-press and tells me i need to get them all done in like 15 minutes, so I start rushing and I’m pissed even more now because she knows that is an imposssible feat for me. But then she comes and hovers over me while I’m trying to press and says that she is just watching so that she can give me Constructive criticism. I tried to say “this is bullshit…this is slavery” as a joke/release of tension because you could literally cut the tension between us with a knife. And she responded really weird and kind of catty…I was not feeling good that day and I knew she was going to pick on me when I walked through the door, and i was sick of it. And her and my assistant manager were both watching and critiquing me, and so I’m getting increasingly pissed off and then i finally say “this is not helping, I’m going to need to step away to calm down” and she just kept watching me and it was awful. And then i say “I need to calm down” and i go to the bathroom, and I could not calm down in there. My heart was pounding and I knew I would have to face her again so I just couldn’t calm down for the life of me.

Then I go out there and she starts on a spiel about how she should be able to offer help, and I called her out for the constant oppressive emotional tone in the workplace and i told her that the way she went about things was not kind to me. And then she began naming off times that she was nice and I said “Yeah, that is nothing compared to just the quiet stability of having a chill and calm working environment” and then I told her this job is more than I bargained for, i can’t keep up and I had no idea what i was getting myself into. And then we escalated a bit, and i told her i needed to go home and that if i was fired then so be it, I’ll just look for another job.

And then I went home, and I cried for a long time. I was shaking and feeling so stressed that i wanted to die. I couldn’t calm down and i barely was able to sleep that night. I made a comment about how women have periods before i left out of anger, and I tried to explain that I don’t want to have periods but i do, and that when i have my period and i drink coffee it just makes me feel anxious and stressed And that I am not able to get as much done. And this comment just added insult to injury since my boss is a trans woman. So i was at home trying to justify what i said but I felt so fucking dumb and awful about it. I said it out of anger, too.

This is not the only time i went home and was unable to calm down. This was the third time that i went home and I couldn’t stop wishing i was dead my nervous system was spiraling so bad into unbearable stress and shame. I tried to walk it off but I couldn’t, i walked my dog for like an hour.  I dreamt some very violent dreams that night. I woke up the next day and took a bit of mushroom before i walked into work, and then i was told i needed to talk to my bosses. And bascially i layed into them both again…Itold my boss she should take a business management course because the way she handled that situation was not appropriate. I contextualized why i freaked out because she tried to frame it like she was just trying to help, but i know she was being passive aggressive…And I said to her “you never liked me, and it actually kills me. I want to get along with you, I do, but you make it really fucking hard sometimes. You speak in bullshit and riddles. You make me jump through shit hoops” and then we argued a bunch and ended up resolving the matter. I got written up for the second time. And weirdly, i feel like everything is going to be okay. I think I am learning to communicate my boundaries for like the first time in my life. I’m 27. And I am fighting for myself where i would have in the past just quit my job and left, I never knew before how to speak up for myself or how to articulate what i was going through but i finally did. It was messy but I am learning. I still feel sick from the stress of days ago but I hope to feel better soon.

Having C-PTSD and being an HSP with ADHD sucks. But I’m figuring out how to move past the fear of connecting with people and just trying to maintain authenticity as best I can. I still have a ton of shame and fear but I’m trying to transmute it into love, and i think things at my work are going much better now. I don;t recommend losing it on your boss lol, if i could go back in time i would try to calm down more fully before facing her again and I would try to articulate myself more professionally and earlier on to prevent the escalation in the first place. I have a really good boss who generally quite likes me so i am lucky i still have a job right now lol. (Thank u lord for giving me a great ass and a great sense of humor). And also thankfully both of my managers are anti-capitalist haha.

Yea, it’s fucked how awful it felt on the days where the mood in the workplace was super low. No one talked and the silence was not peaceful, it was hostile. I could feel it in every cell of my body. It made me feel like i was not safe just like when i was a kid.

TLDR: Trauma caused extreme reactivity in the workplace, thankfully my demons dance with the demons of my coworkers or else id be jobless lol.",2,1749449048.0,hsp,0,1.0,False

She doesn’t know what to do—she likes this guy, let's call him J, a lot, but she's unsure if he likes her back.

**Positive things J has done:**

* J consistently looks at her when they’re in a group, even when she’s not talking. He observes her reactions.
* He walked her home on her first night at her new apartment, even though it was out of his way.
* He helped her find and move into her apartment, driving her back and forth to the real estate office and helping with all the related errands. He also translated the lease for her since she’s a foreigner and doesn’t speak the local language well, and used his car to move her stuff.
* He changed his profile picture for the first time in forever to a photo she took of him and called it the best picture he has.
* He cut her steak during a meal when she just offered him a bite. When a friend pointed out that he’s too nice to her and that’s why she thinks he likes her, J just laughed and pretended to cut his friend’s rice. He even asked who else thought that.
* J pays attention to things she likes or doesn’t like and proudly points out that he remembers whenever it’s brought up.
* When his friends teased him about a wet spot on his pants and she played along, J got panicked and defensive. He’s done that a lot lately, becoming more worried about her misinterpreting things about him.
* J and she were walking back to the office when another guy approached and asked to talk to her alone. J just left to go to his desk. The guy then asked for her number, saying he always sees her around. After the guy left, she saw J at his desk with his headphones on, half off his ears, as if he wasn’t listening to anything. When she asked why he left her and told him the guy made her uncomfortable, J’s face looked shocked and shaky, almost like he was surprised and scared, similar to how she looks when her heart drops. He had no clue. He then called the guy creepy and went outside to look for him and see if he was still around. When they walked back in, J said, “Wow, you’re so popular,” and as he was heading back to his desk, he bumped into the partition and dropped his umbrella. They both laughed about it across the room.
* When J’s friends were hyping him up about his body, he pretended to lift his shirt up, looked at her, smiled, and tilted his head, almost asking, “Should I?/Do you want to see?”

**J’s friends seem to be in on it:**

* One friend made space for J to sit next to her, standing outside the booth until J came to sit beside her, even though his friend, who is also her friend, could’ve sat next to her instead. That same friend also makes her sit in the passenger seat when J is driving.
* Another friend left them alone, smiling, while they were talking, even though he had just sat down.
* His friend complained to her, in front of J, about how J tends to space out his relationships by a year. His last relationship ended almost 5–6 months ago. The friend then asked her if that made sense.
* Once, J only asked her to lunch with his close friend, even though there were others in the office. His close friend pointed that out too.

**Signs J may not like her:**

* He’s deflected her invitation to walk by the river twice. The first time, he was hungover and sick. The second time, he said he had work, even though he expressed wanting to go to the beach with everyone (but they refused because it was finals week and the beach was far—though, to be honest, he wasn’t serious about it either).
* J asked her why she liked the river, and when she asked why he doesn’t, he said the river isn’t special to him because he’s lived nearby for 30 years—but didn’t suggest an alternative way to spend time together.
* He showed no visible jealousy when the other guy asked to talk to her alone. He only commented after the fact and acted like he had no clue what the guy was up to.
* J has never followed up on his own invitations or taken the initiative to spend one-on-one time with her, except for twice—once for dinner when everyone else was busy, and another time to grab coffee.
* he’s nice to everyone ",1,1749448951.0,makemychoice,0,1.0,False

And then—gunfire. Three shots, fast and furious, ripping the night apart. I hit the ground, my knees crashing into the gritty, cold concrete, and I didn't think, just moved. Behind a pile of trash bags. Anything. Anything to hide. The smell—beer, rot, something bitter—stung my nose. Bullets whipped past me, punching into the brick wall with sickening thuds. I could feel them, the air split by each shot. This wasn’t happening. This was the stuff of late-night news, not my walk home. More shots, like a heartbeat in the dark, each one louder, sharper. My breath hitched. I was alive! I was alive, but I didn’t know how long that would last. And then—someone hit me. Hard. A body, covering mine like a shield. His weight slammed me to the ground, the air knocked out of my lungs. I barely saw his face. Just a flash of a figure, a man, pressing down on me, his arm covering my head.

The sound of it—the way his body went rigid and then slack against mine—was bone-deep terror. My whole body went still. His chest pressed against my back, warm and too heavy. And then, his breath—rasping, strained—shuddered against me. The shooting didn’t stop. It kept coming, relentless, chaotic. But all I could feel was him. His body. His blood soaking through his clothes, spilling onto mine. I managed to shift, my hands moving without thinking, searching for the wound. There. Below his right shoulder blade. The blood was dark, spreading fast. ""Wait... Are you hit?""

**Chapter 1**

A screech of tires—sharp and desperate. I turned, barely registering the black sedan swerving toward me. And then—gunfire. Three shots, fast and furious, ripping the night apart. I hit the ground, my knees crashing into the gritty, cold concrete, and I didn't think, just moved. Behind a pile of trash bags. Anything. Anything to hide. The smell—beer, rot, something bitter—stung my nose. Bullets whipped past me, punching into the brick wall with sickening thuds. I could feel them, the air split by each shot. This wasn’t happening. This was the stuff of late-night news, not my walk home. More shots, like a heartbeat in the dark, each one louder, sharper. My breath hitched.

I was alive!

I was alive, but I didn’t know how long that would last.

And then—someone hit me. Hard. A body, covering mine like a shield. His weight slammed me to the ground, the air knocked out of my lungs. I barely saw his face. Just a flash of a figure, a man, pressing down on me, his arm covering my head.

I didn’t even have time to gasp before I heard it—the sickening, wet thud. A bullet. It found its mark in him.

The sound of it—the way his body went rigid and then slack against mine—was bone-deep terror. My whole body went still. His chest pressed against my back, warm and too heavy. And then, his breath—rasping, strained—shuddered against me.

The shooting didn’t stop. It kept coming, relentless, chaotic. But all I could feel was him. His body. His blood soaking through his clothes, spilling onto mine.

I managed to shift, my hands moving without thinking, searching for the wound. There. Below his right shoulder blade.

The blood was dark, spreading fast.

""Are you hit?"" My voice was rough, unfamiliar.

He didn’t answer. Just groaned, a low, pained sound 

**Chapter 2**

My mind raced, a chaotic flurry of protocols and red flags. \*No hospital. No cops.\* The words echoed in the sudden stillness, more alarming than the earlier gunfire. Every instinct, every year of medical training, screamed at me to call 911, to get him to a trauma center. But the desperation in his voice, the way his eyes – even glazed with pain – pleaded, gave me pause. He was bleeding out in a filthy alley, shielded me, and now he was asking… no, \*telling\* me to break every rule.

His suit, I noticed then, even stained and torn, was expensive. The fabric, though dark, had a subtle sheen, the cut sharp and tailored. Not the attire of a typical mugging victim caught unawares. This ""Leo"" was something else, something dangerous, and I was now inextricably tangled in it.

The distant wail of the unrelated siren grew fainter, swallowed by the city’s indifferent hum. I made a choice, a reckless, impulsive decision that felt like stepping off a cliff. “Alright,” I said, my voice flat, betraying none of the turmoil inside. “My apartment. It’s close.”

A yellow cab, its light unexpectedly on, cruised down the adjacent street, a beacon in the oppressive darkness. “Help me,” I grunted, already trying to lever him up. He was a dead weight, his breath coming in ragged gasps. I half-dragged, half-supported him towards the street, my arm around his waist, his arm heavy across my shoulders. His blood, warm and sticky, seeped through my jacket, a grim reminder of the night’s violence.

The cab driver, a man with weary eyes and a drooping mustache, took one look at Leo’s bloodied state and shook his head. “No way, lady. Not in my cab.”

“He needs help,” I snapped, my voice sharp with an authority I didn't feel. I fumbled for my wallet, pulling out a wad of cash – more than I should have. “This will cover the cleaning. My building. Three blocks.” I practically shoved the money at him. His eyes flickered from the cash to Leo, then to the steely look I hoped I was projecting. With a grumble, he unlocked the doors.

Getting Leo into the back seat was an ordeal. He groaned, a low, agonizing sound, as I maneuvered him in. I slid in beside him, pressing my makeshift bandage, now thoroughly soaked, against his back. The cab lurched forward, the city lights blurring past the windows, each streetlight a fleeting interrogation. The smell of stale cigarettes and old coffee in the cab did little to mask the coppery tang of blood. He was leaning heavily against me, his breathing shallow. I could feel the faint tremor in his body, the fight to stay conscious. My own heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat against the silence.

My apartment, usually a sanctuary of order and quiet, felt violated the moment we crossed the threshold. I eased Leo onto the cool tile of the kitchen floor, the least likely surface to be permanently ruined. The sterile white of my counters and cabinets seemed to mock the bloody reality I’d dragged in.

“Stay there,” I commanded, my voice tight. My medical bag, always packed, was in the hall closet. I retrieved it, my movements swift, almost frantic. Spreading a clean surgical drape from my kit onto the kitchen counter, I laid out what I’d need: antiseptic wipes, sterile gauze, sutures, a needle driver, forceps. It wasn't an OR, but it would have to do.

“Shirt off,” I told him, already reaching for a pair of shears to cut through the expensive fabric.

He winced as I helped him, the movement clearly agonizing. The wound was a dark, angry hole, oozing steadily. A through-and-through, thankfully. The bullet had passed clean. Luck, or perhaps the shooter’s poor aim. “You’re lucky,” I muttered, more to myself than to him, as I began to clean the entry and exit points with practiced efficiency. My hands, usually steady in the OR, felt clammy, but they didn’t shake. Control. I clung to it.

He watched me, his face pale, sweat beading on his forehead. “You… you’re good at this,” he rasped, a faint tremor in his voice. An attempt at distraction, perhaps, or a genuine observation.

“I’m a surgical resident,” I replied, my tone clipped, offering no room for pleasantries. I was focused on the task, on the meticulous cleaning, the careful assessment of tissue damage. My apartment, my rules, my sterile field.

He was quiet for a moment, his gaze unwavering. “Most people scream a little more when a stranger starts cutting their clothes off and poking at a bullet wound.”

I didn't look up from irrigating the wound. ""I'm not most people.""

A faint smile touched his lips, quickly erased by a wince. “No, I can see that.” He paused, then, “So, Dr…?”

“Just Claire,” I said, threading a suture needle. “And you’re Leo.”

“For tonight, yes.”

My hands stilled. “For tonight?”

He chuckled, a dry, painful sound. “You know, for a doctor, you’re not very good at small talk. Most try to distract you with questions about your favorite color or if you’ve seen that new movie.”

“Is this your idea of a distraction?” I asked, meeting his gaze. His eyes, a surprisingly warm brown, held a flicker of something I couldn’t quite decipher – amusement, pain, and something else… guarded.

“Maybe,” he said. “Or maybe I’m just trying to figure out who decided to play Florence Nightingale in a dark alley with a guy who clearly isn’t just some random mugging victim.” He winced again as I began to suture. “You know, they say laughter is the best medicine, but I think morphine might give it a run for its money right now. Got any bad jokes? I find those oddly comforting in near-death experiences.”

His attempt at levity, so out of place, was jarring. A man, pale with pain, shot and bleeding on my kitchen floor, was trying to make jokes. “I’m fresh out of bad jokes,” I said, keeping my stitches even and precise. “And morphine.”

“Pity.” He was quiet for a few stitches, his breathing evening out slightly. “So, Claire-who-isn’t-most-people, why’d you do it? Drag me here?”

I tied off a suture. “You were bleeding out. And you asked.”

“And you always do what bleeding strangers ask in dark alleys?”

“Only when they jump in front of bullets for me,” I said, my voice flat. I finished the last stitch, applying a sterile dressing. “Who are you, Leo?”

The humor, faint as it was, vanished from his eyes. He looked away, his jaw tightening. “Just a guy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.”

The evasion hung in the air, thick and heavy as the scent of antiseptic. Wrong place, wrong time. The kind of answer that was really no answer at all. As I cleaned up, my gaze fell on his left hand, resting on the cool tile. Beneath the grime and blood, a heavy gold signet ring adorned his pinky finger, intricately carved with a crest I didn’t recognize but that screamed of old money and something far more complex than a simple ""Leo."" My carefully constructed control wavered. Who had I brought into my home?

**Chapter 3**

The next few days settled into a strange, strained rhythm, the small confines of my apartment shrinking with every shared breath.

My couch, lumpy and familiar, became my bed.

His domain was my bedroom, a sterile space now occupied by a recovering stranger whose real name I probably didn’t know. An invisible line was drawn somewhere between the kitchen and the living room, a boundary of unspoken questions and wary glances.

I brought him broth, the steam clouding the air between us. I changed his dressings with a clinical detachment I usually reserved for the OR, my fingers efficient, my gaze focused solely on the healing wound, ignoring the expanse of skin, the subtle shift of muscle beneath his bandages.

He was quiet through it all, his eyes, those unsettlingly warm brown eyes, following my movements. I could feel his gaze like a physical touch, observant and unnervingly perceptive. He’d see the faint tremor in my hands after a particularly grueling shift, the way I’d rub my temples, a futile attempt to ward off the persistent throb of exhaustion headaches.

“Long day, Doc?” he’d murmur sometimes, his voice still raspy but gaining strength.

“Always,” I’d reply, keeping my answers clipped.

He never pushed about his past, deflecting my occasional, carefully worded probes with a vague smile or a counter-question about the intricacies of aortic valve replacements.

He seemed more interested in the landscape of my life – the relentless hours, the hospital politics I let slip in moments of weariness.

""Why that specialty?"" he asked once, his gaze sharp. ""The heart. So much can go wrong."" It felt less like curiosity and more like an assessment.

The hospital, meanwhile, had become a fresh hell, courtesy of Dr. Lang. My carefully constructed professional life was under siege.

He’d taken to assigning me the dregs of scut work – endless discharge summaries, chasing down lab results that were already in the system. During morning rounds, in front of the entire team, he’d dissect my patient presentations with thinly veiled condescension. “Dr. Bennett, are you \*quite\* sure about that medication dosage? Perhaps a more… seasoned perspective would be beneficial.” His voice, slick with false concern, made my skin crawl.

The final straw came when Mrs. Henderson, a patient I’d spent hours with, presented with a constellation of symptoms that baffled everyone. I’d stayed late, poring over her chart, finally connecting the dots to a rare autoimmune vasculitis.

The next morning, Lang presented my diagnosis as his own brilliant insight, a casual aside about “something that occurred to me overnight.”

My protest, a quiet, “Actually, Dr. Lang, I noted that possibility yesterday,” was met with a dismissive wave. “Team effort, Bennett. Team effort.”

I returned to my apartment that evening, the injustice a bitter taste in my mouth, my shoulders aching with tension. The air inside felt heavy, still carrying the faint scent of antiseptic and him. And then I saw it. A mug of tea, steam still curling from its surface, sat on the kitchen counter. Not my usual brand. Something herbal, fragrant. He was propped up on the couch, a book open in his lap, though I doubted he was reading.

“Figured you could use it,” he said, not looking up.

I stared at the mug. A simple gesture, yet it felt monumental in its unexpectedness. “Thanks,” I managed, the word feeling foreign.

The confinement, the forced proximity, began to wear down the edges of the tension, replacing it with something less defined, more complicated. One evening, as I picked at a bland salad I’d thrown together, I found myself complaining about the hospital cafeteria’s latest culinary atrocity – a supposedly “gourmet” mac and cheese that tasted like wallpaper paste.

A low chuckle rumbled from the couch. “Sounds like a step up from prison food, but only just.” Luca’s eyes met mine, a glint of dry wit in their depths. “At least they’re not trying to pass it off as Italian.”

I found a small smile tugging at my own lips, a reflex I hadn’t anticipated. It vanished quickly, but the moment hung in the air.

Another night, worn down by Lang’s relentless undermining, I slumped onto the end of the couch, the one furthest from him, and let out a sigh that felt like it came from my bones. “He’s going to drive me out of medicine,” I muttered, more to myself than to him.

“This Lang,” Luca said, his voice quiet but carrying a surprising weight. “He targets your confidence because he lacks his own. Don’t let him dictate your narrative. Document everything. Be unimpeachable.”

I turned, surprised by the sharp, strategic nature of his advice. It was the kind of cold calculation I’d expect from a seasoned executive, not… well, whatever he was. “Easier said than done,” I said, though a part of me registered the validity of his words.

He just shrugged, a subtle movement that likely pained him. “Most things worth doing are.”

The next morning, I rushed out late, the knot in my stomach tighter than ever. As I reached for my keys, I saw it—an apple, perfectly placed beside the bowl. Smooth, bright red. Untouched.

It was just an apple. But it felt like everything.

I picked it up, my fingers brushing against the cool skin. Luca was asleep—or pretending to be, I couldn’t tell. But I knew he was watching. And I knew he’d noticed the small things.

Who was this man? The one who saw all the things I tried so hard to hide? The one who offered comfort in the quietest, simplest ways—tea, an apple, a word when I needed it most?

I didn’t know. But I couldn’t seem to turn away.

Chapter 4

The apple was a small, unsettling kindness I couldn't reconcile with the shadows that clung to him. Some mornings, the bathroom door would be closed, the shower running, and I’d hear it – the low, guttural cadence of Italian, a language I didn't understand.

His voice, usually quiet, almost gentle.......

1l6xavl,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1l6xavl/report_former_employer/,Report former employer,"I am just trying to see if I should report my former employer to corporate. Some of my friends suggested I should look into legal action, but I’m not looking to “make a buck” off him. I do genuinely feel like he needs to be held accountable for his many questionable, illegal actions. His clients should also be aware of who they are doing business with. For context, he is an insurance agent for a prominent national insurance company. As such, he is an independent contractor with the insurance company and is therefore considered a small business owner, with a (fluctuating) staff of 5. Fluctuation because people were constantly quitting in my 8 months there. He is also a huge narcissist and never takes accountability for anything. His reputation is everything to him, so getting sued/released from his role and having it made public, would be more satisfying than any monetary payout. I was so stressed and uncomfortable around him, which led to my resignation last year. I was pregnant at the time and didn’t want to do anything, but it has been bothering me for some reason lately- emotions are all over the place postpartum.

Among the many things he did:
Missed at least 76 full days in the office from January-August. (He had another job that required frequent travel out of state from October-March). These are just the amount of days that were documented on his calendar or confirmed in text messages/Teams messages. I started the first week in January when he had two other employees- one of them being remote. His secretary, in office, quit within a week, leaving me alone in office. He hired two more people in February. None of us ever got any real, formal training since he was hardly there, which was a nightmare when dealing with people’s home, auto, life, personal property insurance since we didn’t fully know all the legal requirements yet. We were told to ask the remote employee for help if we needed it. One of the February hires quit in March due to complete frustration over the lack of training, which made us all look incompetent to clients. Someone was hired as a replacement at the end of March, and they quit by June for the sane reason. I quit September and another employee followed in October. I was the “office manager” and had to deal with all angry clients or issues since I was highest ranking in office. Even when he was there, he directed clients to me. 
*corporate does not want agents to have additional work commitments. The regional supervisor was aware of his job, but I don’t think she had a clue how much he was out of the office for it.

When I was interviewing, he said my W-2 would be huge the following year, with Life policies being the bulk of my commission. He said the previous employee in my position used to get life policies “like that” and snapped his fingers very quickly. He said I would be making “six figures” with life policies. I found out a month into working, the office only wrote a total of SEVEN life policies for the previous year- less than one per month. He rode my ass to write 2 per week. Yet, he never trained me how, despite me telling him multiple times I wasn’t comfortable having those conversations and needed help.

Before we were licensed, he gave us his login to run quotes and try to sell those quotes to clients (against company policy and illegal). *have text evidence of various times this happened *

He taught me how to write his signature so that I could sign checks for clients when they took a loan out of their life policy, after a situation where he wasn’t there and I couldn’t help the client- again, rarely there.

Referred to his all female in office staff as “babe” - I am 15 years younger than him, the other female was 22 years younger.

After returning from a trip to Spain, he bragged about how he was “representing for [his] people” on a nude beach. Then, without warning or prompting, he showed me and the other female in office a picture of a naked woman he took while at the nude beach. You could very clearly see her breasts (and could tell she had no idea she was being photographed).

Taught us code words to describe people of different races so we could talk about them in office if clients were there:
Black - beautiful
White - wonderful
Lovely - Latin
Forget what word “represented” Asian
i.e. - “she’s beautiful”

Made at least 4 major mistakes when writing policies for clients. Two of the mistakes led to huge premium increases once corrected. Two mistakes took coverage away from policyholders, as he wrote the policies as replacements instead of new policies:
- One couple bought a second condo and he rewrote the existing policy for the new condo’s address, so they had NO coverage on the original condo. 
- He did the same thing with another person’s new, additional car.
He, of course, took no ownership of any of these mistakes and openly blamed his staff for the mistakes when confronted by customers. These mistakes took weeks and lots of back and forth with underwriting to correct, and he made us do all of the work. I personally heard him take credit for these issues once resolved and bragging about how long he was on the phone with underwriting but he did not care because “he does anything for his clients.”

When he was in office, he was on FaceTime with is long distance girlfriend a lot, or would be in Zoom calls for training for his other job (he would literally put this on his office calendar for us to see) and would tell us to tell clients he was in a meeting if they called for him.

Made us handle personal matters for him:
- Book cars to pick him up to take him to and from the airport from his house for travel for his second job (his account with the car service was listed under “[name] Insurance Agency”
- Ask us to call his realtor (he started flipping houses) to let her know if he was gonna be late for a showing (which of course the showings were always during working hours)
- Call and schedule pressure washing for his deck at his house
- He asked me to scan a summary of all of his finances (salary, commission, checking and savings account balances, investments, home equity). I didn’t know what it was until after I started scanning - he just said “can you scan this and email to me?” In retrospect, he was just trying to brag to me about his net worth.

He used his business credit card to pay for his personal insurance policies. I know because I was given access to the card and noticed it was the same number as the card on file for his policies, which he asked me to pay one time.

Set up an auto policy for his long distance girlfriend, who lived in a different state, stating she lived at his address (your insurance must, legally, be issued in the state you live). This gave her a much lower premium and he got commission off it.

Made me handle all Marketing calls with Corporate to go over our Google Analytics (not part of my job and took away from writing policies for clients, which meant lost commission).

Made me design the artwork and write the verbiage for a local magazine ad. The company emailed him the proof, which he forwarded to me stating the edits he wanted made, instead of just replying directly to the company himself.

When it was just the two of us in office, he asked me if I thought him and his girlfriend should be exclusive. He said a friend had someone for him. He then said long distance is hard and he didn’t know what the end game was because neither wants to move to new state. He then says it would be nice to have someone to get coffee with and do stuff with because he’s bored outside of work. His friend had mentioned to him “friends with benefits” and he said he wasn’t sure about that. Then he said “[my name], would you do friends with benefits?”. It made me so uncomfortable.

I should add, I had been looking for another job throughout the summer because of how uncomfortable and stressed I was working there. I quit when I found out I was pregnant because I didn’t want that stress to impact my pregnancy.

I just wanted to be done with him when I quit, but I had to threaten legal action after I quit because I was never paid my final commission check. I then had to reach out again in February for my W-2 that was never mailed and I was sent a digital copy.

Has my postpartum gotten the better of me and it’s really not that big of deal, or should I do anything about him? At least report him?

Catalaiya's pov:

Leo grabbed my hand and wrapped it around his arm before looking down at me with a reassuring smile. I used my other hand to slightly lift the front of my dress as we walked into the marriage office.

Leo was my elder brother and today he was walking me to the marriage office, sending me off with a stranger that our parents chose for me. Even my dress was chosen by our mother. Our mother and father had a marriage that was more a matter of family agreement... so did their parents and their parents' parents.

It was like a tradition in our family.

The only one who chose love marriage and managed to break free from this long-standing custom was my brother Leo. He has a wonderful family that he cherishes deeply.

I always believed that I could break this tradition just like Leo did, but I faced challenges along the way. I had two relationships in the past, and each time I learned something new. I wasn't as fortunate as Leo, but I am resilient.

The reason I agreed to this wedding was due to the expectations my parents had for me. My husband-to-be comes from a big business family and marrying him would be a great opportunity for my parents to grow their own business. Leo tried to argue with them, defending me but that lead to a big conflict.

This wedding was an arrangement, and I'm sure going to treat it like one. It's been two years since I stopped doing what I love and dedicated myself to my work. Making arrangements and respecting them was one of my daily tasks, and this marriage is just like any other arrangement.

Though unconventional, I chose to accept it for now.

We stepped inside the office and my eyes landed on Mason Mcbelt, the one I'm marrying. He was in a grey suit, red tie, white shirt and he has the hairstyle of a military guy. His gaze lingered on me, an inscrutable mask replacing any discernible emotion.

My parents stood on the side with big smiles on their faces. I ignored them as Leo walked us to the chairs. I sat down, not even waiting for Mason or the man behind the desk to say anything.

""She's just so eager."" I heard my mother explain behind me. I kept my face neutral, looking at the man in front of me.

He cleared his throat, adjust his tie before gesturing for Mason to sit down. He opened a black file and started to talk about marriage. I zoned out, looking at the handmade pictures behind him.

Painting and drawing were one of my favourite leisure activities. My room used to be full of canvas, each one representing the emotion that I felt when I was painting. There was sad ones, complicated ones, happy ones, unfinished ones... Now my room was just white walls with a mirror.

I felt a hand on mine and I turned to my side to look at Mason. He gave me a friendly smile before looking back at the man. I gently removed my hand, hoping he would understand my need for space.

""Now I'll need the witnesses to sign before the couple do."" The man spoke. He did say his name but I don't remember it. Our parents, including Mason parents, walked in and signed the paper.

""You'll be part of this arrangement soon,"" Mason murmured. Since our parents were busy, they didn't notice anything but Leo did. He sends a glare his way, showing him how much he dislikes him.

The man pushed the file in front of us and Mason reached out to grab a pen, eagerly signing it. Our parents noticed his action and chuckled amusedly.

I wasn't.

""Once you sign the papers, you'll exchange rings."" The man added.

Mason placed the pen on the paper before sliding it in front of me. I took the pen and signed, feeling a sense of resignation.

I only wrote a 'c' before the door slammed opened gaining our attention. I dropped the pen, turning around to look who came. None of us invited anyone to this wedding as our parents wanted it to be as quick as possible.

""Oh no,"" I heard my father curse.

Three men all suited walked in confidently. There was one in the middle and two behind him like bodyguards. The middle man particularly looked intimidating and scary. He was definitely the boss.

Who were they?

Mason stood up and so did i.

""Yes, how can we help you?"" Mason asked in his business tone.

Father walked forward, ""Mr Alvaro, why are you here?""

Alvaro? I heard this name before...

""Because of the agreement we both made."" Mr Alvaro replied, looking at father.

""What contract?"" Mason inquired cautiously.

""The contract where he mentions his daughter and my wedding."" Mr Alvaro said making my eyes widen.

Huh?

What on earth?

I felt a hand on my arm and I turned around to look at Leo.

""Just say yes,"" Leo whispered making me confused. Did he know about that?

""No, she's marrying me!"" Mason stated confidently.

""No, you're not,"" Father said shaking his head.

Mason was furious, ""What are you talking about!?""

""He's right, The agreement included a marriage arrangement as part of the terms."" Father admitted.

I took a deep breath, steadying myself. Why would he do that?

""He's not, He'll have to formally challenge my position."" Mason glared at the middle guy.

""Mason, he's Aziel Alvaro. He doesn't have to conflict you to take your place."" Leo spoke beside me, making the middle guy shift his gaze on me. His piercing greyish eyes held an intensity that made me tense.

Aziel Alvaro

**Chapter**2

Catalaiya's pov:

Aziel Alvaro

Wait a minute, I know this name.

Oh my god!

He's a formidable figure in town, known for his uncompromising control over both business and social circles. Whispers about his methods varied, but all agreed crossing him was unwise. Even local authorities seemed reluctant to interfere with his affairs.

I also heard that he has a legal business, where he works like normal people.

Why would father sign a contract with him?

Aziel walked forward, making Mason move to the side as he went to the desk. He took the paper from the file and folded it in half, making the ladies sigh. The man behind the desk gulped looking at Aziel.

""Take out a new one and be quick,"" Aziel told him and he nodded wordlessly. He quickly opened the drawers by the side and took out another set of papers. He put them on the table in front of us.

""Wait, let ask her what she wants,"" Mason stated looking at me.

So now they'll ask me what I want?

""The terms are binding, though I wish circumstances allowed for more discussion."" Father spoke.

I clenched my fist by my side, trying to stay strong. I wanted to express my feelings clearly and take control of my own life.

""The witnesses have to sign first."" The man told Aziel.

Aziel turned around and nodded at the two guys, who came with him. They walked forward and each one at a time signed onto the paper. Leo left my side and went to sign too.

""Now you both sign,""

Aziel signed the paper in seconds, his face blank, his fingers wrapped around the pen tightly. He drops the pen and back away, putting his hand in his pant's pocket.

""Your turn Catalaiya,"" Father spoke.

His voice was firm and steady.

I took the pen and signed it. It wasn't the most elegant signature, but it was done. I carefully placed the pen back on the table before stepping back near Leo.

""Now the ring,""

One of Aziel's friends took out a blue velvet box, handing it to him. Aziel opened it before walking toward me. A few long strides and he was in front of me. He grabbed my hand, swiftly put the ring on my finger before dropping my hand.

Mother walked to me with another velvet box and I grabbed the ring. I held the ring in the air and looked up at him. He lift his hand and I put the ring on his finger.

It was a little tight as the ring size were of Mason.

""This union is now formalized,"" the man said, his words met with our tense silence. He gulped, looking down.

""That is nonsense."" Mason scoffed looking at the wall.

""This is quite unfortunate."" Mason's father stated. They all left, including the man behind the desk.

Aziel and the two guys walked out, leaving me, Leo, my father and my mother inside.

""Come here, my little daughter."" Father opened his arm, with a small smile on his face.

I ignored him and turned around to hug Leo tightly. He wrapped his arm around me, rubbing my back slowly.

""We should walk out, Aziel is waiting,"" Leo murmured.

We pulled away and he gave me a reassuring smile.

""If you need anything, call me."" He said and I nodded. I wrapped my arm around his and we both made our way outside. I didn't care if my parents were following us or not. Once we were near Aziel's car, Leo handed me my phone which he kept in his pocket since my dress didn't have one and I didn't bring a purse.

Aziel sat in the front while I sat in the back with one of his friends. There was a good amount of space between us as I leaned against the door, looking outside.

The car started to move and I waved at Leo. He smiled and waved back. Soon, I lost sight of him.

""Drop us at my place,"" Aziel told his friend.

Aziel's pov:

I put the last file in the drawer before closing it. There was a knock on my door and I said a loud 'come in'.

A familiar guy walked in but I couldn't remember where I saw him. He sat down in front of me.

""Yes?"" I asked.

""I'm Leo Snyder from Snyder company. My father came to you for a work a few months ago."" He says and by his surname, I knew who it was.

His father prioritized financial gain above all else.

""I already did his work,"" I stated.

""I know but you didn't take your money as per the contract."" He replies.

If I remember clearly, there was no money involved. The contract clearly says that he will give me his daughter as my wife when I'm done with his work. I honestly didn't want to sign this contract as I didn't want to get married but my father forced me. He was present in the office when Leo's father came to see me.

""It isn't important,"" I said briefly.

""We both know the 'money' is my sister Catalaiya."" He said firmly.

Something tells me there's more to this.

""What do you want?""

""That you keep your word."" He simply added.

""You want me to marry your sister out of a contract,"" I said and he nodded.

""Failing to honor this agreement would be... uncharacteristic for a man of your standing."" He says.

I chuckled humourlessly,""You think it's wise to test my resolve, in his own office.""

""My associates are aware of this meeting and will follow up if necessary."" He spoke confidently.

I clenched my jaw, glaring at him.

**Chapter**3

Aziel's pov:

Few days ago before the wedding part 2

The door slammed opened and I looked up at Adam, my elder brother. He looked confused and concerned while I looked pissed.

""What the heck, dude? Carter told me what happened earlier."" He said as he sat in front of me. Carter was my best friend and business partner. A few minutes later when Leo left, I called Carter and told him everything... cause if I didn't, my office would be completely destroyed by my anger.

""Like always your father's idea wins,"" I said sarcastically. I'm not really close to our father and each time I talked, I always say 'his father'.

He sighed leaning in his seat.

""I thought you would get away from this... like it's been weeks since you did their work."" He spoke.

Just like me, father forced Adam to marry a woman who was one of his friend's daughters. Her name's Alicia and she was mean to Adam. My brother's bfinancial priorities differed significantly.

""Carter uncovered discrepancies in their motives,"" I said gaining his attention.

""The union appeared to be more a result of external pressures than a reflection of mutual consent."" I explained.

He furrowed his eyebrows, ""So his brother came to you because of the money status.""

I shrugged,"" I think so. His father is known for his greed for money, it wouldn't be a surprise that his son and daughter are just like him.""

""You suspect her compliance stems from pragmatism."" he concluded and I nodded.

""There's no other reason. Why would a brother come to a mafia leader, tell him to marry his dear sister out of a contract?"" I inquired.

""You're right,"" he nodded, ""What will you do now?""

""I'll do the wedding to show him that I do keep my words. Besides, I don't need to commit to a contract-based wedding; it'll just be an arrangement."" I stated.

Leo's pov:

I reached home and closed the door, letting a breath of relief. I made sure that no one was following me home.

""How did it go?""

I turned around and saw my lovely wife, Kassy, with my adorable girl, Aria, in her arms. My lips curled in a smile, feeling better now that I've seen them. I walked to them and pulled my wife into my arms before kissing my daughter's cheeks.

""I hope it works,"" I murmured.

Kassy frowned, ""You should tell Catalaiya.""

I shook my head no, ""She's already upset about what's happening, if I tell her this news, she'll be in shock.""

""She needs to know though,"" Kassy insisted.

A few days ago, I learned that Mason was planning to marry my sister just to get her million worth properties. He already made the papers and it was accidentally sent to our office. That's how I learned about it and when I read the property paper, it was mentioned that the rightful owner-Catalaiya-was dead due to an 'unexplainable' reason.

That got me thinking and I did a lot of research on Mason. I knew talking with my parents would be a complete waste of time, as they were the ones who chose this scoundrel for her.

When doing all the research, I got hold of Aziel Alvaro's file and the contract he signed with father. This was the only way, to stop Mason from killing my sister. It was the only way to protect her.

I didn't mean to threaten Aziel, I don't have the guts to do that. I know his powers and what he can do. I love my family and I wouldn't want any harm to come upon them.

""I'll tell her a few days after the wedding... hopefully Aziel come to the rescue."" I sighed.

Aria cooed and I smiled at her. I picked her up in my arms and pampered her with kisses. She smiled widely showing her pink gum.

Aziel's pov:

Wedding day in the car\*

Carter drove us to my house. I sat in the front because I didn't want to sit beside her. Instead, Adam sat beside her. I glanced at her through the front mirror and she was looking outside, lost in her thoughts.

I had no way to gauge her intentions—this marriage was as much a mystery to me as to her.

We reached the big gate and the guard nodded at me before opening it. Once it opened, Carter drove right to the front area and parked. I unbuckled my seatbelt, opening the door.

I glanced at her and she was standing near the door, taking in the estate's grandeur with wide eyes.

Of course she will be awed.

The front of my house was kinda plain and dull to see, but at the back, it was more gorgeous and luxurious. The front of the house hides all the charm of the back, always surprising newcomers.

I love this place so much...

I walked to the front porch and opened the door. She tagged along, taking in the architectural details with quiet fascination. Adam and Carter stayed near the car as I have to go back to work for the influential circles. I had to postpone a meeting for this wedding and I'm already 15 minutes late.

I'm always on time...

""Thalia,"" I called out loudly.

Thalia was my maid and she lives here, in the guest house with her husband Alfred, who was one of my drivers. They both had been working for me for the last 6 years. I was 20 years old when I bought this house and now I'm 26 years old.

Thalia was in her forties while Alfred was in his fifties.

Thalia walked toward us and looked at Catalaiya with wide eyes.

""We're married. She'll be staying here now."" I informed Thalia and she nodded.

""Show her around and take care of her. I need to go back to work."" I stated.

**Chapter**4

Catalaiya's pov:

This house was enormously huge and so pretty. I try to keep my stunned expression in as I looked around.

Aziel left the house while I stood in the same spot, awkwardly.

""Hi, I'm Thalia. I'm the maid here."" She introduced herself. Thalia was the same height as me, she had short dirty blonde hair, rosy cheeks, dark brown eyes and she has really pale skin.

""Hi, I'm Catalaiya... the new bride."" I awkwardly said the last part as I didn't know what else to say and she just smiled at me, not judging.

""Well welcome home, you look pretty in your dress."" She complimented me.

It was the first compliment that I got since this morning.

""Thank you,"" I said sincerely.

She walked behind me and closed the door before turning toward me again.

""None of your stuff arrived yet and I doubt you want to stay in this dress... how about I lend you one of mine and then I'll show you around?"" She suggested.

""Yes,"" I nodded.

""Sit down or walk around, I'll be back soon."" She smiled as she dashed to the end of the room toward the door which I think lead outside.

She lives in the back?

I looked around at my new surroundings. I took a step forward before I stopped. The floor was shining, showing how clean it was so I lift the front of my dress and removed my heels, grabbing them by their straps.

I walked to the open glass door behind the couch and I was surprised to see the set-up of his pool. There was another set of couches outside, palm trees, a firepit area, a patio area. I didn't walk outside as I waited for Thalia. I sat on the couch which was comfy.

I heard the door open, ""I'm back.""

I looked at her and she walked to me with a pink dress.

""I think this will fit you."" She says as she handed me the dress.

""Thank you,"" I said again.

""Come, I'll show you the master bedroom.""

I follow her to the stairs which were on the side of the living room. I hold onto the rail as I was afraid I would step on the front of my dress and fall. Once upstairs, there was another living room in the middle.

On either side, there was a door leading in a hallway. She turned to the right side and I followed her. This hallway leads directly to one door. She opened it and stepped inside.

""It's pretty,"" I commented.

She chuckled, ""Aziel has a great choice.""

She walked to another door near the window and she opened it, ""here's the bathroom. You can change here while I'll make something for you to drink. What would you like, Coffee, tea, milkshake, juice?""

""Juice will be good,"" I replied and she nodded.

As she walked out of the room, I dropped the dress on the bed and my heels near the wooden sitting area. I walked near the window and slightly pull the curtain to the side to look outside. The view was the front entrance. I let go of the curtain before looking around.

There was another door that lead to the closet. His closet was behind the wall of his bed. I walked in and I was amazed by the number of suits he has. Once I was done looking around, I grabbed the dress and changed.

It felt good to be out of the wedding dress.

Since I didn't have any shoes or sandals to wear, I had to wear my heels. I grabbed the wedding dress and laid it on the small couch. I then made my way downstairs to the kitchen where Thalia was.

I stood by the counter and she handed me a glass of juice, ""Fresh orange juice for you.""

""Thank you,""

I took a sip and the cold liquid felt refreshing.

""Follow me, I'll show you around.""

She walked in front of me and I followed her.

""There are two guest rooms here, that we barely use.""

She walked to the last room, which was closer to the back door she used earlier. She opened it and stepped aside so that I could see the inside.

""It's a small library,"" she spoke as my eyes roamed around. Drat, this room was more colorful than the other rooms.

""Who usually reads here?"" I asked curiously.

""No one... I only read a few books in my free time in my guest house, but never in here. Maybe, you will use this room more than us."" She says making me look at her.

Maybe...

""Do you wanna see my guest house?"" She asked and I nodded. We walked out of the room and she opened the back door. We walked on the green grass, to a guest house. She slides open the front door and made her way inside.

""Alfred, we have a visitor."" She says loudly before grabbing my hand. She excitedly pulled me into her living room and at the same time, Alfred walked in from their bedroom.

""Oh, who is this lovely lady?"" He gave me a warm smile.

""I'm Catalaiya, nice to meet you."" I introduced myself.

""She is Aziel's wife,"" Thalia added making Alfred's eye widen.

""And he's my husband Alfred. He's also one of Aziel's drivers."" Thalia told me.

Oh...

""Aziel got married?"" Alfred asked, not believing Thalia.

""Yes,""

""Well welcome,"" he smiled and I smiled back.

These two were nice and welcoming. I feel less miserable and sad now as I know there were two people here who I can talk to.

We stayed in the guest house for a few minutes talking before we walked back to the main house. Thalia cooked and we had dinner together. For some reason, I felt really tired. So one hour later, I was on the bed ready to sleep.

1l6x6zu,https://www.reddit.com/r/SNHU/comments/1l6x6zu/thoughts_on_bus225_oddities/,Thoughts on BUS-225 oddities,"I drank a lot of coffee and can't sleep, sorry.

My points below may be nitpicky to some, but I can't imagine doing this class with a learning disability or English as a second. I admit, I'm a chronic overthinker and a lifelong lover of vehicles, so maybe what I've found frustrating with this class can be chalked up to those personal details lol. By toeing the line I'm pulling an A so far, which means so can you, believe me! The project sections are purely meant to teach you data sourcing and presenting, but man.. there isn't one part of this class that isn't an unbalanced mess..

1. It seems like common knowledge in this sub that the $40+ workbook is worthless. Our professor even posted an announcement to disregard some of Soomo's prompts for Project 2 because they don't match the rubric. I'm SO curious..has anyone actually handed in a Project 1 that meets the page number ""requirement"" of 3-4 AND received an A on it?  I think mine was 18 when Soomo spat it out to me. By the time I was done editing, adding citations and double spacing it was 25 pages...

2. The project prompt is vague. ""You're a successful U.S. engine manufacturer looking to divest..."" so like.. what do we build engines for, currently? I can't think of one major U.S. car manufacturer that sources engines from an independent, outside vendor (except for the very small % of Cummins powered Ram trucks). A lot of the project's questions make it seem like you're Ford or VW, yet the prompt makes you sound like Cummins or Kubota. The vagueness allows you to take some creative liberties, so I'm not necessarily knocking it, but how you interpret that could really waste your time. For me, I immediately envisioned the prompt pertaining to commercial use, as that industry ACTUALLY has engine manus that aren't also vehicle manus. 

3. You'll likely have 25+ citable sources to do this project well, but hear me out. One of the SNHU provided links (IBISWorld or Marketline maybe?) brings you to global auto industry stats, yet the project is on the US auto industry. If you caught that and changed the search to give you U.S output, that's great, however 'U.S. auto manufacturing' is ALL vehicles, meaning data about motorcycles and class 8 commercial will be in there. Your numbers will be vastly different from someone else's if you don't then update it again to  ""US light vehicle manufacturing."" I assume you can do this project fine using all vehicles, but if you did, how did you factor in the information about the class 8s and motorcycle trends? Top manufacturers, various percentages, etc will all be very different depending on what one of these data sets you begin with.

4. Many questions pertain to information about trends in ""vehicles."" If this project made sense (to me) you would be researching usage of turbos, variable valve timing, etc.. you know.. things that pertain to engines.. Why on earth would an ""engine manufacturer"" ever request information about vehicle color trends unless their divestment strategy was to become an ""automobile manufacturer?"" Not one designer of this project thought how odd it would be for you to show a slide about popular paint colors to a room of clients interested in using your engines in their farm equipment? 

5. Asking for numbers on ""sales by fuel type"" when the writers obviously mean ""propulsion/power type, is bizarre. EVs don't have engines... so if I'm an engine builder that's trying to sell my product to a new industry, how would I benefit to include how well EVs are selling? ""EV sales"" pertains to numbers of vehicles, not the amount of motors produced to propel them.. If a tractor company is in the market for a small turbo diesel to power their new mini excavator, what would knowing Teslas sales numbers do for them?

👉 CONTINUE READING 👈

# Chapter 1

Victor Vaughn, the heir of the Metro Society, was known far and wide for being a devoted husband.

For my birthday, he bought up every firework and rose in the city.

Countless fireworks exploded in the sky, and Victor tenderly leaned in to kiss me.

""Sweetheart, I won't let you envy any other woman.""

A sea of crimson roses built a castle, and from the 33rd floor of the high-rise, a passionate confession could be seen: Evelyn Hart, I love you.

When I caught a cold and fever, Victor practically ordered the entire city's private doctors to treat me.

Even the giant screens in the city center displayed our wedding photo as a promotional billboard, celebrating our perfect love.

But just a moment ago, as I grabbed Victor's coat, a single, unfamiliar condom tumbled out.

It was the strawberry-flavored one that I hated.

I paused slightly.

Then, I bent down to pick up the condom.

The pink packaging, as I brought it closer, still carried the nauseating smell of strawberries.

But that familiar package… I felt like I had seen it somewhere before.

Last month, when I visited Victor's office, I happened to run into his new secretary, who was holding a package.

She didn't see me and bumped straight into me, causing the box in her hand to drop. Tiny foil squares scattered across the floor.

""You okay?"" I'd asked, automatically crouching to help. Juliette's face turned bright red when she saw me.

""Mrs. Vaughn, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to bump into you.""

As I picked up a small packet, she quickly snatched it out of my hand, blushing.

At the time, I just found it funny. Why would a young girl buy something so personal in the office?

But Juliette smiled and explained, a touch of pride in her eyes.

""This is from my boyfriend. We go through them so fast; we need to buy more every few days. Mrs. Vaughn, please keep this a secret.""

The memory snapped back to me, and now, holding the exact same wrapper, my blood turned to ice.

""Sweetheart, what are you thinking about?""

Victor walked out of the bathroom, still wrapped in steam, and gently hugged me from behind.

Seeing my pale face, his heart tightened. He pulled me close with a worried expression.

""What's wrong, baby? Did someone upset you? Is there someone in your department bothering you? Just tell me, and I'll fire them immediately!""

I slowly raised my head, silently gazing into Victor's eyes.

Six years of marriage, and he was always so gentle, caring, and attentive to me.

Whenever I wasn't feeling happy, he'd buy every rose in the city to cheer me up, rent out a giant private cinema for me, and find any way to make me smile.

Everyone said he was a rich, pampered husband.

I felt like he spoiled me too much and laughed.

""Keep this up, and they'll say I'm your downfall.""

But Victor didn't care at all. His eyes were full of tenderness as he held me tightly.

""Then let me burn the world for you.""

Those words from the past echoed in my ears.

But people change.

I smiled bitterly, raising my hand and waving the pink package in front of him.

""What's this?""

Victor's face flickered with panic, but he quickly regained his composure.

""Sweetheart, where did you find this? I've never seen it before.""

I pointed to the coat next to me. ""It fell out of the pocket.""

Victor froze for a moment, then knocked his head in frustration.

""It's my fault, I must've grabbed the wrong thing during the team-building event last time.""

""Must've grabbed it by mistake at the company picnic. Someone ordered chicken wings; I thought these were napkins.""

I stared into Victor's eyes without saying a word.

Seeing my silence, Victor suddenly grew tearful and hugged me, explaining desperately.

""Evie, you don't think this is mine, do you? I know you hate strawberry flavor more than anything. We don't keep anything strawberry-scented at home, so this couldn't possibly be mine.""

As he explained, he pulled me into his arms and kissed me gently.

""Sweetheart, you are my everything. If you don't believe me, I'll go back to the office and figure out who this belongs to, and fire them right away.""

His eyes were clear, with no sign of lying.

Saying this, Victor actually stood up, ready to leave.

I grabbed the corner of his shirt and smiled.

""No need.""

Victor turned around, and I spoke clearly, one word at a time.

""I trust you. You wouldn't lie to me.""

Victor smiled and ruffled my hair before getting up to prepare the lunch I'd take to work the next day.

I leaned against the railing on the second floor, watching his busy figure in the kitchen, lost in thought.

After six years of marriage, Victor insisted on cooking for me himself.

No matter how busy he was, he always found time to prepare fresh ingredients and cook meals for me so I could take them to work the next day.

My coworkers would ask, ""Mr. Vaughn, with all your money, you could hire any five-star chef. Why waste time cooking yourself?""

Every time, Victor would answer, ""Evie likes the meals I make.""

As long as I liked it, he would do it without hesitation.

But how could he have forgotten?

On our wedding day, I told him that if he ever lied to me,

I would disappear completely from his world.

# Chapter 2

Outside, the thunder rumbled. After seeing I had fallen asleep, Victor carefully tucked me in.

Just as he was about to wrap his arms around me from behind, his phone rang.

In the dim light, Victor frowned as he glanced at his phone, then looked back at me, still sound asleep.

The footsteps quickly faded away.

Downstairs, I heard him deliberately lower his voice.

""Didn't I say no calls after work hours? Anything can wait until tomorrow. Don't bother me when I'm with my wife… What? You came to my house?""

Victor quickly hung up and rushed downstairs.

I got out of bed, slowly making my way to the floor-to-ceiling window.

This spot offered a great view, allowing me to clearly see outside the villa door, where Juliette stood drenched.

The door opened soon after.

Victor was holding an umbrella.

""What are you doing here? Didn't I tell you not to come near my house, and especially not in front of my wife?""

Juliette looked up at him, her face filled with pleading.

""Victor, I'm scared of the thunder. I… I missed you.""

She tiptoed and kissed Victor on the lips.

Victor stiffened.

He held the umbrella with one hand to shield her from the rain, while his other hand rested on Juliette's waist to steady her.

""Stop this.""

Victor said this, but his actions showed no signs of stopping her.

He let her kiss him enough, then frowned slightly and reached up to wipe the rain from her face.

""Before I met you, how did you get through rainy days? You're soaking wet. I'll take you to shower, or you might catch a cold.""

Juliette's clothes were soaked through, clinging to her body, accentuating her alluring curves.

Victor quickly looked away, swallowing hard.

""Victor, can I take a shower at your place?""

At her request, Victor's expression immediately turned cold.

""No.""If Evelyn sees you—"" He thrust his jacket at her. ""Wait in the car.""

Then he tossed her the car keys.

Victor handed her the umbrella, then turned back to change and came into the bedroom to turn off the lights.

""Leave the light on.""

My voice suddenly broke the silence.

Victor's hand froze in place.

He stood there stunned for a moment, then turned to look at me, his smile a little stiff.

""...Sweetheart,"" he finally said, ""how long have you been awake?""

# Chapter 3

I looked up at him, pretending to have just woken up.

""Honey, what are you doing standing there? Why aren't you coming to bed?""

My gaze fell on the suit he had changed into, and I frowned.

""Weren't you in your pajamas just now? Do you have somewhere to go?""

""No, I was just trying on the clothes I'll wear tomorrow. I'll be right to bed, sweetheart.""

Victor told me to sleep first, but I insisted on watching him get into bed with me.

Victor's face was calm, though he was hiding something. He changed back into his pajamas and held me close.

""Sleep tight, baby.""

I closed my eyes, but my mind kept replaying the image of him kissing Juliette earlier.

Juliette, his assistant, had been with the company for two years now.

Before this, I never suspected anything between them.

To reassure me, Victor had insisted on hiring only male assistants after we married—no woman could get close to him.

The day Juliette applied for the job, I happened to drop by with fruit for Victor.

When I learned she hadn't been hired, Juliette collapsed on the floor in despair and cried uncontrollably.

""Please, Mr. Vaughn, if I don't get this job, I'll die.""

Victor remained cold and indifferent.

In desperation, Juliette ran to the company's rooftop to threaten him.

""Victor, I meet all the qualifications, why should I lose this job just because I'm a woman? I won't accept it! If you don't hire me, I'll jump from here today.""

Worried about the scandal, I convinced Victor to take her on.

After that, he never treated her kindly, only letting her assist him behind the scenes.

But when did they start… this affair?

My thoughts were a tangled mess. Victor was fretting over his secretary downstairs, and here we were, each lost in our own thoughts.

Several times, Victor tried to pull his hand away, but I held on tightly.

After what felt like an eternity, I heard a low sigh from him.

Victor opened his phone and sent a message to his assistant.

I squinted and caught a glimpse of what he sent:

""Juliette is in my car. Take her to a hotel—I can't get away.""

The assistant quickly replied.

Victor sighed in relief, put his phone down, and cuddled up to sleep with me.

The next day, when we got to the office, the atmosphere was off. Juliette had thrown a tantrum and made a mess of the office.

Colleagues surrounded her, trying to comfort her.

""Jules, did you have a fight with your boyfriend?""

""Those dark circles! Did he keep you up all night?""

""Stop talking nonsense, can't you see that Jules is upset? It must be because her boyfriend mistreated her. There's no good man out there…""

When I walked in, I met Juliette's swollen, tearful eyes.

Her gaze shifted to Victor behind me.

""You're right. All men are the same. They're all liars!""

She flirted blatantly with the male assistant, glaring at Victor.

Victor remained calm as ever.

But I felt the stiffness in his posture.

As usual, he made me coffee and brought it to my office.

""Baby, I made your coffee with extra sugar. I know you like it that way.""

Victor wrapped his arms around my waist from behind.

""Go ahead and work, I'll have the assistant bring your lunch in a while.""

I nodded, and Victor quickly went back to work.

But as he passed by, he called out to Juliette without any emotion, ""Come to my office.""

Colleagues began gossiping.

""Mr. Vaughn's gonna rip into her again.""

""Last time, they spent two hours in his office. Afterward, Juliette came out with red eyes, staggering. I feel sorry for Juliette, she's been stuck working for him all this time.""

""Yeah, Mr. Vaughn only spoils his wife Evelyn. He doesn't care about anyone else…""

I couldn't help but sneer at their conversation.

Is that so?

I hesitated for a moment, then opened my laptop to check the surveillance.

After some adjustments, Victor's figure appeared on the screen.

This was from a hidden camera I had bought just a few days ago.

I had placed it in Victor's office to test the camera's clarity.

I never imagined it would come in handy.

The office door closed.

Juliette, with a cold expression, pouted. Victor sighed in frustration but pulled her into his arms with affection.

""You were trying to provoke me earlier. I told you, last night I couldn't get away because my wife woke up. Don't be mad. Tonight, I'll tell Evelyn I'm on a business trip, and I'll spend the whole night with you. Okay?""

Juliette looked up at him with pitiful eyes. ""Who knows if you're lying to me again?""

""Every day, you're always with Evelyn, cooking for her. You never make me any food.""

Juliette pretended to punch him playfully. ""Do you believe me? I'll eat all the food you made for Evelyn at lunch!""

Victor's face darkened. ""Don't you dare.""

""I told you, we keep our affair secret from Evelyn. If she knows anything, not only will I fire you, but I'll never see you again. Get it together.""

When Victor loosened his grip, Juliette quickly grabbed his hand, looking scared.

""I'm sorry, I was just joking. You left me last night. I'm still upset. Don't you know how to comfort me?""

Looking at Juliette's pitiful face, Victor's eyes darkened with possessiveness.

He grabbed the back of her head and kissed her roughly.

She whimpered in his arms.

She fumbled to untie his tie, eager to undo his belt.

""Is the door closed?"" Victor asked in a hoarse voice.

Juliette nodded like a doe, ""It's already closed. Your wife won't find out.""

I stared at the scene on my laptop, tears streaming down my face.

They couldn't even wait for a hotel. They were already all over each other in the office.

I fought the urge to break down the door and watched the whole thing quietly, recording the screen as evidence.

Victor.

So, you've been lying to me all this time.

# Chapter 4

An hour later, they lay in each other's arms, panting.

""You ruin me,"" Juliette whined. ""How come your wife never looks this wrecked?""

Victor leaned lazily back in his chair, smiling as he pinched her chin and kissed her.

""Feeling better now? Wear something sexy tonight. I'll meet you at the hotel.""

She giggled, leaving a fresh hickey before storming out—playing the part of the ""scolded employee.""

Colleagues saw Juliette storming out of the office and rushed to comfort her.

Only I found it all so ridiculous.

For two years, they had been pretending to fight, secretly sharing stolen moments right under my nose.

At lunch, Victor had already had my food heated and brought it to me, 20 minutes early.

""Sweetheart, try the shrimp I made. You like it light, right? I tweaked the recipe a little…""

Under Victor's collar, I could see the faint mark left by Juliette.

My stomach churned.

""I don't want to eat. I need some air.""

Behind me, Juliette's voice called out. ""Evelyn, can I try it? I want to taste Mr. Vaughn's cooking.""

Victor's eyes narrowed with coldness, but Juliette continued teasing.

""I'm so jealous. Mr. Vaughn cooks for you, but I wonder if your boyfriend's cooking is as good.""

Her intentions were clear, and I could see through it all. I pushed the lunchbox toward her. ""Go ahead.""

I left the room and went downstairs, intending to clear my head. Victor followed, but I stopped him.

""Go back to work, I'll just take a walk downstairs.""

I went to the underground parking lot, found Victor's car, and opened the dashcam.

I had never looked through his things before, because I believed in trust between spouses.

But now,

The footage showed them fucking multiple times—and one damning conversation:

""Did you put this in my pocket? Evelyn saw it. If she finds out, you're done.""

Victor's voice was cold. Juliette looked guilty.

""It was the one we didn't finish last time. I forgot about it.""

Victor didn't say anything.

Juliette, trying to calm him, said, ""I'm sorry, I'll make sure it doesn't happen again. Don't be mad, please. Don't ignore me…""

Victor was easily swayed by her words, and soon, the car was filled with their urgent, intimate sounds.

Enough. I closed my eyes.

What more evidence did I need? This was already painfully clear.

I walked around the building and called my father, who was abroad.

""Dad, can you help me get a new identity? I'm thinking of leaving the country. As for this Evelyn identity at home, let it… die.""

On the other end of the line, my father sounded excited.

""Did I hear that right? My daughter finally wants to come with me abroad?""

""Changing my identity is not a problem, but what about your husband? He loves you so much, won't he be heartbroken to see you leave?""

I smiled coldly. ""He doesn't know.""

I had promised myself that the moment I found out he was lying, I would vanish from his world forever.

And I had prepared a surprise for him.

My departure would make sure he never forgot me.",1,1749448407.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

1l6x55k,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1l6x55k/everyones_selfish_and_youll_be_alone_when_you/,"Everyone’s selfish, and you’ll be alone when you need people the most.","My sibling took her pg exam and got a good rank. I was always there for her, even willing to take back on my semester exams and then take the sem exams next year, cuz she was feeling alone at home, and I had to go to another city to take my exams. I made hundreds if not thousands of mugs of coffee for her,without her having to ask, pretended to study beside her even when I had nothing to study/was too tired to study. Everytime she cried or had anxiety, I would drop my studies or whatever I was studying to be there for her, even when she would get angry etc. Did so much petty work and chores, would use my own tg ids to find lectures or courses when she had to rent them. God, what did I not do! Ik all this is not something great, but what I’m talking about is EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. When someone’s there for you, it lifts a lot of burden in studies. I even prayed to God that she should get a good rank even if I’m the one who fails at all her attempts( idk im used to praying like this since childhood, thinking one thing has to be given up to pray for another)

Now she’s having another exam few months later, so she has a lot of time as well as backup. I do understand that she needs a break from studies, but she’s nowhere, she’s lost in her own world now, in her own room doing idk tf what, I just want someone to ask me once in a while how I’m doing. I’m preparing for a way more difficult exam than her. I’m even younger than her. She is clearly seeing me struggle, cry and what not. But she just assumes/gaslights me by saying ki “Tu to kar legi padhti rehti hai poora din”, and runs away from any emotional support. do I not need someone to check up on me then?

I’ve told her I‘ve started self harming, one day before my semester exams(masters),  I was having a really hard time studying and felt so dumb, I slapped myself atleast 100 times that day, I was all alone in my room, she went to another room to study knowing that my mood was not well. I told her but she never talked about that thing again. Ik it was all my doing, but she being a med student could have guided me in some way. I beat myself so hard while studying, my cheeks pained for 6-7 days whenever i tried to smile.

When she needs emotional support, she wants someone to be there for her, when I need someone, she just assumes I’m fighting with her and not struggling myself, and goes to flight mode. She did the same thing during my cuet pg exams, I was all alone at home, preparing for an exam that was not my ug subject, so things were difficult. I get it that internship is difficult. But she always went out once in a while with her friends, eating and what not, I was all alone at home, she would never call or text me, When i cried to my mother about this, she would overcompensate by sending me food then ghosting me for weeks on end.

I‘m not a great person and I have flaws too, but I have never seen such a narcissistic person in my life. She gets jealous of her own friends getting a good rank/better rank than hers, her entire life revolves around academic validation and the ‘attention‘ that she gets from relatives because of being a dr. Her fav dialogues are ”mujhe ata hai/maine kiya/mujhe pata tha ye”. Even my mother acknowledges in front of our relatives how much i do for her, but she has never thanked me, rather all she sees is my flaws, such as my anger issues. I myself acknowledge that I have anger issues. But I have done much more than anyone in this house/family for her.

I’.m back to the same place, having people at home, still feeling all alone, locked up in my room and studying. She makes everything about herself😂, I’m stressed about studies & not talking to anyone? Why ask me anything, straight away go to mummy and say “merse baat nhi karrhi/mujhse ladri”. The world revolves around her majesty. She’s the main character cause she has a Tshirt with that printed.

Best she can do is lend me money if I want to buy any course, but I can ask for money from my father too, all I want is emotional support.",3,1749448297.0,OffMyChestIndia,1,1.0,False

she likes this guy, let's call him J, a lot, but she's unsure if he likes her back

**Nice things J has done:**

* J consistently looks at her when they’re in a group, even when she’s not talking. He observes her reactions.
* He walked her home on her first night at her new apartment, even though it was out of his way.
* He helped her find and move into her apartment, driving her back and forth to the real estate office and helping with all the related errands. He also translated the lease for her since she’s a foreigner and doesn’t speak the local language well, and used his car to move her stuff.
* He changed his profile picture for the first time in forever to a photo she took of him and called it the best picture he has.
* He cut her steak during a meal when she just offered him a bite. When a friend pointed out that he’s too nice to her and that’s why she thinks he likes her, J just laughed and pretended to cut his friend’s rice. He asked who else thought that.
* J pays attention to things she likes or doesn’t like and proudly points out that he remembers whenever it’s brought up.
* When his friends teased him about a wet spot on his pants and she played along, J got panicked and defensive. He’s done that a lot lately, becoming more worried about her misinterpreting things about him.
* J and she were walking back to the office when another guy approached and asked to talk to her alone. J just left to go to his desk. The guy then asked for her number, saying he always sees her around. After the guy left, she saw J at his desk with his headphones on, half off his ears, as if he wasn’t listening to anything. When she asked why he left her and told him the guy made her uncomfortable, J’s face looked shocked and shaky, almost like he was surprised and scared, similar to how she looks when her heart drops. He had no clue. He then called the guy creepy and went outside to look for him and see if he was still around. When they walked back in, J said, “Wow, you’re so popular,” and as he was heading back to his desk, he bumped into the partition and dropped his umbrella. They both laughed about it across the room.
* When J’s friends were hyping him up about his body, he pretended to lift his shirt up, looked at her, smiled, and tilted his head, almost asking, “Should I?/Do you want to see?”

**J’s friends seem to be in on it:**

* One friend made space for J to sit next to her, standing outside the booth until J came to sit beside her, even though his friend, who is also her friend, could’ve sat next to her instead. That same friend also makes her sit in the passenger seat when J is driving.
* Another friend left them alone, smiling, while they were talking, even though he had just sat down.
* His friend complained to her, in front of J, about how J tends to space out his relationships by a year. His last relationship ended almost 5–6 months ago. The friend then asked her if that made sense.
* Once, J only asked her to lunch with his close friend, even though there were others in the office. His close friend pointed that out too.

**Signs J may not like her:**

* He’s deflected her invitation to walk by the river twice. The first time, he was hungover and sick. The second time, he said he had work, even though he expressed wanting to go to the beach with everyone (but they refused because it was finals week and the beach was far—though, to be honest, he wasn’t serious about it either).
* J asked her why she liked the river, and when she asked why he doesn’t, he said the river isn’t special to him because he’s lived nearby for 30 years—but didn’t suggest an alternative way to spend time together.
* He showed no visible jealousy when the other guy asked to talk to her alone. He only commented after the fact and acted like he had no clue what the guy was up to.
* J has never followed up on his own invitations or taken the initiative to spend one-on-one time with her, except for twice—once for dinner when everyone else was busy, and another time to grab coffee.
* he’s nice to everyone",3,1749448206.0,SeriousConversation,2,1.0,False

**Chapter 1**

The day I was diagnosed with stomach cancer, the young girl Cassian, my man, a underworld king was seeing approached me.

“I know I’m the other woman,” she confessed. Her honesty was almost shocking.

A sharp pain shot through my stomach, and it felt like my blood had momentarily stopped flowing. I stared at the young girl in front of me, and for a moment, I saw myself in her.

Biting her lip, she continued, “I know you're about to get married, but—”

“Cassian doesn’t love you anymore.”

“I’ve been with him for a year,” she said. “We’ve been together seventy-eight times: fifty-three times in hotels, twenty-one at my place.”

“And four times in your house. In your bed.”

She met my gaze and added, “If Cassian still loved you, I wouldn’t be here.”

Lighting a cigarette, I looked at her through the smoke and said, “Anything else? Go on.”

She took out her phone and showed me a video.

The angle was discreet, like a hidden recording...

I laughed as I heart what the young girl Cassian was seeing.

I had been with Cassian Wagner, the underworld king, for ten years.

I’d had his favorite lily tattooed on my collarbone.

He’d finally agreed to marry me, but he was also seeing this 18-year-old girl. And she had the audacity to confront me face to face.

In the months leading up to our wedding, he spent his time enjoying life with her, counting down to their breakup.

Chapter 2

I crushed the cigarette in the ashtray.

The girl, fresh-faced and just eighteen, radiated youthful innocence. She was untouched by the world.

The moment I saw her, I knew.

She reminded me so much of myself.

So much like Alina at eighteen.

""You got one thing right: if Cassian still cared for me, you wouldn't even be in the picture.""

I stood, a dull pain twisting in my abdomen, but I leaned on the table to mask it.

""But take my advice: don't get too attached. Cassian never loved you, just like he never loved me.""

""He's in love with the idea of Alina.""

That perfect, ethereal Alina who vanished long ago while helping him climb his way up in the world.

""In a few years, he'll find another stand-in, and you'll end up worse off than me.""

Of course, I was lying to her.

My own time was running out; how could she fare worse than I had?

At worst, she'll just be cast aside by Cassian once he gets bored.

Chapter 3

I was eighteen when I got involved with Cassian Wagner.

I grew up without parents, and the grandmother who raised me passed away when I was fifteen.

That was when Cassian appeared.

He pursued me relentlessly.

He showered me with gifts, eager to give me the world.

Cassian was handsome and made me feel secure.

I quickly fell for him.

On my nineteenth birthday, he coaxed me into tasting the forbidden fruit.

That night.

From pain to surrender.

I became one with him.

The next day, Cassian introduced me to his circle of friends.

I had never encountered such a scene; I timidly clung to Cassian's sleeve, softly following his lead as he presented me.

The way they looked at me was full of teasing.

""Cassian, why did you bring a kid?""

""She's too naive; she might hold you back.""

At that time, I didn't understand what ""holding back"" meant to them.

I couldn't help but softly protest, ""I won't.""

""I won't become Cassian's burden.""

Never.

But later, as I gradually got exposed to Cassian's world, I realized the kind of life he led.

Living on the edge, constantly in danger.

To avoid being a burden to Cassian and to stand by his side, I forced myself to adapt to that environment.

Ten years passed.

I cut my hair short, dyed it, smoked, and got tattoos.

My body was marked with countless scars.

Because I was tough enough, I stood by Cassian as he climbed to the second-in-command position of London's underground world.

But Cassian didn't seem happy.

Countless nights.

He would hold me in his arms, his fingers tracing the scars on my body before he leaned in to kiss them.

""Alina.""

He'd bury his face in my chest and sigh, ""I still like the old you.""

And after a moment of shock, I would push him away, light a cigarette, and laugh, half-jokingly.

""Cassian, you've got a lot of nerve saying that Chapter 4

Cassian returned home in the early hours of the morning.

I was lying in bed, not truly asleep, just lost in thought, gazing into the darkness.

Until Cassian pulled me into his arms.

""Still awake?""

He leaned down to kiss me, but his lips found only empty air.

He hesitated, suppressing his irritation as he held me close. ""Who’s upset you? I’ll sort it out, okay?""

""Cassian.""

""Yeah.""

The room was so dark I couldn’t see his face, but I could smell the faint scent of lavender clinging to him.

""Let’s break up.""

His body tensed, then he released me and lay back on the bed. ""What is it now?""

He rubbed his temples with visible frustration. ""You’re not a child anymore. Why all the drama?""

""Break up?"" he chuckled slightly, ""Alina, you’re not getting any younger. Who would want to marry someone who smokes, drinks coffee like it’s water, has tattoos, and runs a business tougher than any man?""

My chest tightened painfully.

I pressed my hand against my heart, but it couldn’t ease the sharp ache.

Last year, when I needed stitches on my arm, I was allergic to the anesthetic. Twelve stitches were sewn without a single complaint from me.

But Cassian’s drunken honesty brought tears to my eyes.

""Cassian,"" I couldn’t help but ask, ""If I were seriously ill, would you...""

""Alina.""

He cut me off, a hint of impatience in his voice. ""Stop asking such pointless questions.""

""If you really were terminally ill, I’d follow you into death, okay?""

He pressed his temples. ""I’m swamped with the wedding and business matters. I can't spend time soothing you right now, try not to overreact.""

Just then, his phone rang.

Cassian disconnected the call, annoyed, but it rang again.

After a few rounds of this, he got out of bed, phone in hand. ""What?""

I could hear a girl’s indistinct crying on the other end.

Cassian cursed under his breath, ""What a damned hassle.""

He complained, yet quickly left the room.

""Some business issue, I need to handle it.""

""Get some sleep, don’t wait up for me."" Chapter 5

My wedding to Cassian Wagner was scheduled for the third of next month.

We planned for it to be a modest ceremony.

I never disclosed my illness to Cassian.

It's terminal, with no real chance of recovery.

I also never revealed to him that I never actually planned to marry him.

I could accept everything about Cassian.

But betrayal was something I just couldn't tolerate.

The thought of him holding another woman, kissing her eyelids, trying to find a trace of who I once was in her, made my stomach turn.

I felt completely sick.

I began this journey with Cassian when I was eighteen, and it's been a full ten years now.

Today, the doctor tells me I have roughly six months left to live.

Looking back, I've wasted a significant part of my life on him.

With only a little time left.

I just want to be Alina.

I've booked a ticket to travel overseas, hoping to see a world I've always loved, yet never explored, while I still have the strength.

Coincidentally, the flight is also scheduled for the third of next month.Chapter 6

In the early morning, I crossed off another day on the calendar.

Just ten days left until I leave the country.

I heard the door open behind me.

Cassian walked in, bringing a gust of winter’s chill with him. He shrugged off his coat and came over to hug me.

He still wasn’t a fan of my short hair.

His gaze followed mine to the calendar, lingering on the heavily circled date in early March. He chuckled softly and gently pinched my cheek, ""You're eager for the wedding, aren't you?""

He counted aloud, ""Just ten more days.""

He nuzzled his face into my neck, ""How about we find time to dye your hair back to brunette in the next few days? Maybe add some extensions?""

""You'd look stunning for the wedding.""

""No need.""

I stared blankly at the calendar. ""Not many days left.""

""Short hair suits you, too.""

Cassian was silent for a moment. ""Hmm.""

He let go, picked up his coat from the chair, ""There's so much to do for the wedding. Just yesterday, one of our venues got wrecked. I've been busy, so I won't be around for a bit.""

He looked at me as he spoke.

As if he was waiting for me to give in.

Hoping I’d say, okay, I'll come with you to dye my hair, let’s get the extensions.

But I just met his gaze with indifference.

""Go ahead.""

""After all, there are only ten days left.""

Cassian didn’t say anything; he turned and walked into the night.

He didn’t look back.

Chapter 7

Seven days before the wedding.

I found myself at a tattoo parlor on the outskirts of town.

The owner, a woman in her thirties, appeared youthful, but her eyes held a depth of experience.

She glanced at me, ""What do you want to get done?""

I rolled up my sleeve, pointing to the initials 'CW' on my..............

Blue Tokai Vienna Roast – It was alright.

Blue Tokai Dhak – Really enjoyed this one. Smooth, well-balanced, and hit the right notes for me.

Blue Tokai Thogarihunkal – Meh. Didn’t leave much of an impression.

Savorworks ""Boss’s Wife""  Honestly, I hated this one. Way too fruity, almost sour. Felt more like a fruit tea than coffee.


I think I have come to realize I really prefer dark roasts more. Chocolatey, nutty, bold. The fruity acidity of light roasts just doesn’t do it for me.

Any tips on how to make this coffee more palatable? I use channi brewing method

Machine of consciousness makes everything around have a Reason.," I want you to have another look on this simple visualisation of a “sample goal” for every observer. This is a simple Fact-result (Fr) statement “I want a coffee and croissant”. It has some Dramaturgical potential (Dp). First the idea of 1Dp in your head appears and the goal is set. Number 1 here means achievement of the goal. If 0 is no goal at all, then we say 1 is a full achievement of the goal state. All that in between are a numbers and states of not fully emerged story.  

https://preview.redd.it/v6xhzwhcbu5f1.png?width=1666&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a411d2f98ffc6a31bc50baec8f12f842c4f26ef

Here we pretend the achievement of that goal took only 4 Planck times. To be able to see the graph of achieved goal in general. Idea of having a coffee brake appeared and formed till some exact Planck’s step of your life led to creation of this Fact-result statement, after witch you decided to do real action. This exact idea made you walk for 4 Planck’s seconds to the table where you have that croissant and coffee ready for you. Each step you were spatially closer to the goal and nothing disturbed you in the way.

At worse case some cat or spider could jump at you and you brake your ankle. And forget about coffee. Or a meteorite strikes your apartment at that moment. That are highly unlikely to happen events. But still they can happen and can effect your decision making.

In our case person got to their coffee in 4 Planck’s steps and mission was accomplished. Dramaturgical potential of that idea, that (Fr) event was rising through steps and got full number 1 meaning. And it took only 4 (Re) Reaction steps. Your brain set in front of table, felt a smell of fresh bakery and coffee, and “told yourself” We made it buddy! You got your coffee, drink and let’s move on! We have a bunch of other goals to fulfil, you set before, and we need to create some more goals. 

This fulfilment or dismission of a set Fact-result event is somewhat sacral and fragile as for people. If you set a goal to become a best pilot in the world, you will follow it through some number of (Re) reaction steps of your life till you succeed or till you will be forced or desire by yourself to dismiss this goal as not valid for upcoming moment.

  What mind can’t stand is not fulfilled or denied goals. Recursion style behaviour. Constant (Re) events that loose the primal (Fr) task and repeat itself over and over.

For example you want to breakup with a girl, but you can’t do it because you are not “ready” now. All bad phycological states of human mind mostly come in a shape of that unfulfilled goal of some kind coming again and again into your head. Action running in circles with no conclusion.

https://preview.redd.it/cyia5f3fbu5f1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=17ffe522b85d741b81879a2541862981ad26cdcf

  Like if some kid saw a murder when he was small and later couldn’t “let it go” and lived through his adult life with despair and “craziness” of some kid because that story with a dead people, that goal of killing was not fully understood by the brain of a child. He saw murder and got this terrible question in his head: “Why adult people kill each other with such anger?” and in other words kid set a goal of finding an answer to this fundamental question.

  He grows on but nobody gives him answer that suits him. Nothing seams to logical for him to approve that behaviour. He thinks he didn’t get a proper answer and if due to bad luck later this guy met more bad aggressive people in life, he will confirm to himself that life works like that, everybody should hate and hurt each other. But he still can’t find right answer for that first childish fundamental thought: “Why?”. And this doesn’t let to close the cycle of fulfilment of that goal, answering why. He sees violence is pointless but it “has to move on”. This is a mind trap billions of people are in. 

Such inflated mind states suck out all time and energy that could be used for enjoying life.

Good idea would be to answer all your inner questions. Many of which need further personal research and effort.

There is no other way to feel really happy except of fulfilling all your goals or letting them go. Leaving some goal in a state “I will decide later” turns it into a burden that slows you down.

Coming back to the picture of getting the coffee we can imagine there are multiple long-term and short term goals like that. And they all effect each other, and goals of other people effect yours and so on, it is a big pile of probabilities, that are shown as playing cards at each step of the poker game. Players show what they got, then another turn goes, and player have other card combinations with a new perspectives.

So the process of playing poker step by step is a nice visualization of what dramaturgical potential does in this world. It brings rules, why 4 kings are great but 4 aces are better. And more important, the winner gets it all. If you got to your goal this turn, it might be because some one didn’t. 

Seeing the horizontal line of Planck’s time on the graph you might notice it has a certain Planck’s step in past when your dramaturgical potential started to effect the system, and It always will have a certain x Planck’s step in future when you stop to effect the world around you. Like for example when you die. 

The idea of showing “goal reaching process” in a graph if brought by quantum dramaturgical perception.

If the world is quantumly dramaturgical in first place, it could be easily described though this Fact-result and Reaction events-quants.

[(FULL STORY WAS TOO LONG TO POST SO HERE'S A LINK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1shV2CeHMartD4DnQXpdhrERcxwjQsLCp/view?usp=sharing)*)* ***CHAPTER 1 IS WRITTEN BELOW***

*So. thank you to anyone* that *reads this. I greatly appreciate your time....* ***Long story short:***

**CH 1:**

I’m no stranger to this long gravel road. Every year for the past five years, I’ve spent what’s arguably the best week of my entire summer out here at Hilltop Ranch — a Christian summer camp where my best friends and I have attended. Climbing those 20 or so miles of gravel off the main highway in a church bus with rusted leaf springs always brought with it the feeling that I was about to have the best week of my entire year.

This time, though, it was different.

This time, it was just me — blasting the AC in my beat-up 2001 Dodge Dakota with bald tires, carrying two plastic bins filled with everything I’d need to live for the summer and a backpack full of camera gear.

When I graduated high school, I was lucky enough to get into college for journalism. But my parents insisted I get a job over the summer — something about “learning what the real world was like.” I’d never done much besides work on and off at a local coffee shop. After a year of dealing with that hag Mrs. Johnson, who was constantly trying to get me fired for making her drip coffee wrong, I wasn’t exactly eager to jump back into customer service.

Honestly, I was pretty nervous about college. Even though I had an incredible friend group — we’d grown up together over the last 18 years — I was starting to realize that I might not be great at making new friends. I’d never had to before. None of my friends were going to college with me, and that fact kept worming its way into my mind.

One day, lying in bed, mourning the loss of my childhood and contemplating my existence, I had the thought to apply to work at Hilltop. It was always the best week of my year, and even though I didn’t know the people I’d be working with, it was at least familiar.

I applied to be the camp videographer, and they got back to me pretty quickly. The director, Mr. Bill actually said he remembered me from attending Hilltop the last five years. He called it a godsend since the video position was one of the last ones left to fill.

The only snag was that Mr. Bill wasn’t thrilled I’d have to arrive a few days late to staff orientation because my high school’s graduation was later than most.

In the end, it wasn’t a big deal. Mr. Bill seemed genuinely excited I’d be joining the team.

Fast forward a few weeks: after a goodbye that was surprisingly emotional from my dad — a rather stern man I never expected to cry when I left home for the first time — I got in my truck, said a brisk prayer that the AC would work, and waited for the engine to turn over before beginning my drive.

I plugged my phone into a USB-to-aux cable adapter, which was then adapted a second time into a fake cassette. I loaded up a playlist and settled in for the next eight hours.

If crossing into North Carolina gave me a burst of energy, then finally turning onto that familiar dusty old road sent me to cloud nine.

Hilltop Ranch is located deep in the Appalachian Mountains — about an hour and a half from Boone but closer to some towns I can’t quite pronounce that have Indian–sorry, Native American names. Sorry, I don’t want to get canceled before I even start college.

The road winds up about 800 feet of elevation over 20 miles. It’s a tight, one-lane gravel road with plenty of bumps and a few small wooden bridges over stream crossings.

This was my first time driving it myself, instead of spending my time unsuccessfully trying to flirt with girls in the back of a church bus. I noticed a few rotting old structures deep in the foliage for the first time. The road was beautiful in an old, rugged way. The dense greenery wrapped around my truck on both sides, making me feel truly isolated. Though I knew the property was owned by a family that had gotten rich from logging, the sheer scale of this 100,000-acre forest felt like I was entering another world entirely.

Finally, I reached the last mile of the road, where a large wooden sign greeted me: *Hilltop Ranch.* The face of the sign was starkly new, with fresh wood and paint, standing in sharp contrast to the worn signposts holding it up — ones that looked like they’d been there since long before I was born.

Driving down that last mile, it really hit me: I was about to start over.

Even as the cabins came into view, I found myself wondering, *Why did I throw away the last summer I’d have with my friends to come out here?*

That thought quickly disappeared as the shimmer of a lake became visible through the trees.

Hilltop Ranch is arranged entirely around a central lake. Most of the buildings — the dining hall, rec center, chapel, and cabins — cluster on the south side. Around the lake, you’ll find the ropes course tucked into the woods on the east side, a paintball field nestled among towering pines on the north side, and the stables and private housing for the director and year-round staff on the west side.

The cabins are numbered 1 through 20 but come in pairs — so cabins 1 and 2 share the same building, divided by a wall. Cabins 1 to 10 are for girls, 11 to 20 for guys, all arranged in a semicircle at the bottom of the lake, with the rec hall, dining hall, and chapel in the middle.

I parked my truck at the dining hall and realized I had no idea where to go next. There were plenty of cars around, but no other staff in sight. I grabbed my backpack from the passenger seat, intending to walk inside and ask someone where I’d be living.

Before I could even reach the door, I heard a vehicle pulling up quickly behind me.

It was an ancient, single-cab Ford truck, its faded blue paint barely visible beneath patches of rust. The driver, a guy my age in a tank top and camo hat, nodded as he pulled up. Riding in the bed were an athletic-looking guy wearing a Grateful Dead shirt and a pretty brunette with friendly but piercing blue eyes. Her face looked oddly familiar, but I couldn’t quite place it.

“Who are you?” asked the guy in the bed of the truck.

“Um… My name is Rob. I'm the video guy for the summer,” I said a little nervously.

The girl in the bed quickly lit up. “Oh! You’re the last summer staffer to arrive! We were wondering who we were missing.”

This caught me off guard and internally, I started to spiral. I knew that being the last one to get there might mean missing out on some bonding opportunities, but I didn’t expect to be called out so quickly. Luckily, the other two guys got excited once they realized I’d be one of their fellow staff members for the summer.

“Dude, you should come with us! We’re about to take Blue Lightning around the lake and try to break the record,” the driver said.

“Blue Lightning?” I asked, looking down at the rusted old truck.

“Yeah, it’s the truck they keep out here for the Crew Staff,” the athletic guy laughed. “Every summer we try to beat the record they set back in 1996 racing this thing around the lake.”

“They did it in five minutes and thirty-two seconds,” the driver said in admiration. “Four miles of twists and turns, bobbing and weaving through the paintball field… I don’t know how they made it past Mr. Bill's house at that speed without getting busted, but that’s why they have the record, I guess.”

“I’m Colt, by the way,” said the driver.

“Sophie!” piped the brunette.

“Taylor,” said the athletic-looking dude.

“I’d love to, guys, but I need to find out where I’m living so I can move in all my stuff,” I said.

Immediately, a small scowl crept onto my face as I regretted sounding so boring. Luckily, Sophie seemed to recognize my mistake and quickly shot back,

“Since you’re the videographer you’re on support staff and they all share cabin 16 together. Looking at your truck, you don’t have that much to unpack anyways. Think of this as a tour of camp!”

I couldn’t argue with Sophie's logic so I grabbed my backpack of camera gear and jumped up into the back of the truck with Sophie, Taylor and a small spare tire. The second before I was settled Taylor slapped the side of Blue Lightning and Colt slammed his foot on the pedal sending us in a wild reverse towards the lake. Skidding onto the road the truck shifted hard into drive and we were off. Blasting around the first turn onto the east side of the lake we flew past a group of staffers walking out from a small trail with ropes and climbing harnesses around their shoulders. 

“You’re not gonna do it!” Shouted a chubbier guy as we flew past.

“That’s Dean, he's the Cabin 13 councilor and hates fun,” Taylor said as Dean and the other staffers grew smaller behind us in a cloud of dust. “He’s not a snitch though.” 

“What is there to snitch about?” I asked as we flew down the road.

“Oh we’re all supposed to be at orientation right now,” Sophie laughed. “I guess you’re not because you just got here but we definitely are.”

“Yeah tonight’s basically the session where they tell us to report it if we see an adult leader touch a kid or something,” Taylor joked looking at me waiting for a response. 

“Oh…” I said while attempting to feign laughter out of awkwardness.   

Blasting down the gravel it felt as if we were being swallowed into the forest. Camp would occasionally appear behind us, the buildings flashing in the afternoon light through patches of trees as we gained speed. Sophie was perched on the toolbox holding on for dear life but excitement was written across her face in a wide smile. Taylor on the other hand had leaned back against the tailgate, a peaceful expression on his face while he soaked in the moment.

Rounding the next corner we drove past the paintball field, a massive field taking up most of the north side of the lake with some barricades and thick towering pine trees that I remember using as cover as a camper during what at the time had seemed like a scene from Black Hawk Down. Colt was yelling loudly from the cab but we couldn’t quite hear him from the bed of the truck over the gravel and air rushing past as we drove. Birds chirped softly as we flew past, the symphony of the forest on full display. 

Sophie turned her face to Taylor,

“I can’t believe he actually thinks we’ll be able to do it. This truck was old in 96 and it’s been 19 years and 2 engines since then,” laughed Sophie. “Probobaly the same set of tires though if I had to bet.”

Taylor laughed. “Yeah but would you rather be at the exact same orientation you sat through last year, or get Colt riled up and maybe break a record in the process?”

Suddenly it clicked for me how I knew Sophie.

“You’ve worked out here before?” I yelled as we took a sharp turn. 

“Yeah I was a councilor the last two years but wanted to be on crew staff this summer,” Sophie yelled over the rushing wind. “I liked being a councilor and all but I needed a change of pace after–”

Suddenly there was a loud pop and the truck lurched to the side. Colt slammed on the brakes and the three of us were thrown around the back of the truck, falling down as Blue Lightning came to a sudden stop in the grass. I gathered my bearings and realized that Sophie had fallen on top of me as we both lay on the bed of the truck. Embarrassed, I quickly shot a glance at Taylor as Sophie righted herself. Taylor met my eyes and seemed to give me the smallest of nods as if to say “nice” and then he jumped over the side of the truck. 

“Guess I hit a rock or something,” Colt said as he stood looking at a blown tire. “We need to change this tire fast before we get caught out here.”

Looking across the lake I could see the camp buildings lit in the golden light of the approaching sunset. It was pretty out here. I had half a mind to grab my camera but as soon as the thought crossed my mind I silently cursed because it hadn't even occurred to me to check if my camera was ok after the fall. 

“Hey you guys need my help? I gotta make sure I didn’t just break a lens,” I said as Colt and Taylor were examining the popped tire. 

Sophie, meanwhile, had quietly drifted from the mangled tire to the back of the truck, her eyes fixed on the forest. She looked at ease in the outdoors, confident even… But I couldn’t help noticing how she kept the bed of the truck between herself and the treeline… Subtle, but deliberate.

“Yeah go for it we can do this pretty fast,” Taylor said walking back around to the bed and rolling out the spare. “Honestly yeah, check on your stuff because if we broke the video guy’s camera before camp starts we’ll be in even more trouble.”

I knelt on the passenger side of the truck and hesitated before opening my camera bag. By the grace of God, my camera was intact. One by one, I checked my lenses: wide-angle… okay. Portrait… okay. Zoom… okay.

Breathing a sigh of relief, I turned to see Taylor and Colt undoing the final bolt securing the shredded tire.

“Hey guys, my stuff’s all goo—”

I froze.

From the woods behind me came a ragged murmur tangled with the sharp snap of breaking twigs. Breath? Growl? Speech? Whatever it was, it slithered into my skin and raised every hair on my body.

“Yo Rob, you good?” Colt asked, watching as I whipped around to face the treeline.

The forest fell silent again. Everything stopped—even the birds.

“Do you hear that?” I whispered, backing up around the truck.

“Hear what?” Taylor said casually moving the spare into place.

“Something in the woods... sounded like talking,” I trailed off.

Taylor and Colt stopped to listen, but in the glow of sunset, Sophie had gone suddenly pale. Her face, warmed by the fading light, stood in sharp contrast to her frozen stance toward the trees.

“Guys, we need to leave,” she said softly.

“What? Probably just coyotes or a mountain lion waking up for breakfast,"" Colt shrugged.

“Yeah, and we can’t go anywhere until this is fixed,” Taylor added, bending down to secure the spare.

I glanced at Sophie. She was still, almost statue-like, afraid to move.

“I didn’t think they could get this close…” she whispered.

“I’m sorry, what?” I said, unsure whether to laugh or run.

“Just put your bag in the back. Be ready to go,” Sophie said, eyes locked on the woods.

Not knowing what else to do, I complied. Colt and Taylor kept working, calm as ever. Sophie might be a little crazy, but… she was cute—so I went along with it.

We stood there, the truck bed between us and an endless wall of green that felt far more menacing than it had before. The sunlight caught the leaves, setting them aflame with color as the Colt and Taylor continued their work on the tire.

Somewhere in my brain, I knew that as a red blooded American male I should probably prove to Sophie that I could change a tire. But alas I didn’t. I was fine waiting.

“All right, we’re good to go!” Colt shouted, jumping up and tossing the tools into the cab.

“Here’s the plan,” Taylor said, standing and dusting off. “If we get Blue Lightning back to the Crew Staff shed before dinner, everyone will still be busy with orientation, so no one will notice the spare. Rob, you’ll need to find Mark—he’s the new assistant—”

Sophie cut him off. “Taylor. Colt. We need to LEAVE. Can we talk plan on the drive?”

Colt opened his mouth to argue—then froze.

This time everyone heard it.

“Oh...” Colt said.

We all froze in place in opposition to the forest towering over us. 

Taylor dared to speak next, “What is–” 

Before we could even think, the forest seemed to explode. The sound of something large crashing through the underbrush, branches snapping wildly in its path barreling towards our position snapping us from our trance like a bolt of lightning.  

“GO! GO! GO!” Clay shouted, jumping into the driver’s seat. The engine roared to life, and Blue Lightning surged forward.



Taylor jumped into the back pulling Sophie up behind him while I dove headfirst into the truck bed. 

Taylor smacked the side “LET’S GO,” He yelled as the wheels began to spin aimlessly in the dirt, the spare tire not finding purchase easily. 

As the crashing in the trees grew nearer Blue Lightning caught traction and we were violently pulled back on the road. A cloud of dust kicked up behind us as we gained distance. The truck moved erratically on the undersized spare tire and Colt was fighting to keep us steady at speed. As we sped back towards camp I saw a blur of white by the treeline we had been stranded at. Quickly looking back I saw Taylor yelling at Colt to drive better but then glancing over at Sophie her eyes met mine and I knew she had seen it as well. The forest opened up and we began to see buildings drawing closer to us. 

The rest of the drive went by fast. Not break the record fast as we had come back the way we came, but we were back behind the dining hall within 5 minutes. Colt stopped the truck and cautiously got out of the driver's seat, meeting us at the bed. 

“Man, can you guys believe that?” Colt proclaimed victoriously.

“You still think that was a Coyote?” I asked him.

“Could’ve been,” Colt said, starting to grin. “Whatever it was, it can't catch ole Blue. 

“Bro Coyotes don’t whisper,” I said, glancing back at Sophie who was sitting quietly on the bed of the truck. 

“You ever heard a mountain lion though? Those things sound like screaming women,” Colt said in rebuttal. 

“Look,” Taylor said with a new sense of authority. “We can talk about this later but orientation is about to end and if we don’t move this truck into the shed now everyone is going to know we blew the tire. The shed has a full size spare I can put on and no one will know the difference. Rob, like I was saying earlier you need to find Mark. He’s the new assistant director and is usually on our ass for stuff like this but since you’re new he needs to do your employee onboarding. Use that to keep him distracted so he doesn’t come looking for us if we end up missing dinner… Sophie you ok?”

At the mention of her name Sophie sprang back to reality, her face returning to the same excited “ready for adventure” look I had seen when she had first coaxed me into getting in the truck even if it did seem a bit forced now.

“Yep! I’ll help with the tire,” She said, wanting to jump back into action. 

“No, you should go to your cabin and come to dinner from there,” Taylor said. “That way we won’t all show up to dinner at the same time. Mark already thinks the three of us are trouble so if you don’t seem involved that’s better for all of us in the long run and you get to keep your status as a golden child a little longer.” 

“Golden child?” I asked incredulously as Sophie scowled at the phrase.

“Yeah Sophie here has worked three years in a row,” Colt piped up. “It’s pretty normal for people to do 2 but not a lot of people here have done 3 so we joke that Mr. Bill and his wife must think she’s the chosen one or something.”

“Shut up Colt,” Sophie said while delivering a surprisingly solid hit to his arm.

“Ow!” Colt yelled. 

“It’s not my fault they like me more than you.” Sophie teased. “And that plan’s fine by me. I could use a shower anyways,” she remarked.

“I thought I remembered you!” I exclaimed. “You worked here the last year I was a camper!” 

Too late I realized that what I said came across a bit awkwardly. I felt the conversation stall out and in the two seconds of silence I felt like I just undid all the legwork from the last hour or so. All at once, like God answering an unspoken prayer, upbeat music started to play from the chapel speakers.

“Shit they’re wrapping up everyone go!” Taylor hissed at us. 

Just like that he and Colt got into Blue Lightning and flew away leaving me and Sophie alone on the porch of the dining hall. 

“Sorry if that was awkward…” I admitted. “You know, saying that I was a camper when you worked here and all. I didn’t want that to be weird or make you feel old or anything.”

“Oh so you’re calling me old?” Sophie slyly said, a wide grin spreading across her face..

“No no not like that,” I said putting my hand on my face. “I just… I don’t want to mess up having friends out here.”

“Calling me old isn't going to undo the trauma bond we all just made out there,” Sophie laughed. 

I laughed with her, mostly just glad to have not ruined my chance at friendship. Thinking about her wording though, ""trauma bond” I was quickly reminded of that white blur I saw race out of the woods.

Sophie… I don’t think that was a mountain lion.” I said. 

“We just… We don't need to worry about that,” She said looking back at me. The tough and carefree demeanor was gone and it was quiet now. “We’re safe on this side of the lake though.” 

“Safe from what?” I asked. 

Sophie looked like she had immediately regretted what she had said. I could watch her trying to formulate a response but we were cut off as the doors to the chapel burst open and loud voices of people our age began to pour out towards us. 

“It doesn't matter!” Sophie said, starting to jog towards her cabin. “Welcome to Hilltop I guess.” 

With that Sophie turned and disappeared into the dark towards a row of cabins in the distance. Watching her go I was left feeling perplexed by how she had phrased it. What had she meant by “This side of the lake?” At the same time though I felt oddly rewarded. It was day one. Day one and I think I had friends.

I jumped out of my skin as a firm hand put itself on my shoulder. 

“You must be Rob!” An older voice said from behind me. 

“Yes sir,” I said a bit sheepishly, turning around to see a man in his older 30’s with a beard and flannel. 

“I’m Mark, I'm the assistant director out here,” Mark said in a voice that was oddly friendly yet with an air of forced authority. “Did you just get in?”

“Yes sir,"" I said, turning around to gesture towards my truck. I’m not sure where to put my things. 

“Well let’s do your onboarding paperwork and get you moved in,” Mark said, pushing me into the chapel hall. “And don’t worry. I know you’re a few days late but you’ve still got plenty of time left in staff training to learn the lay of the land before campers get here. You’re gonna love working at Hilltop.”

The opening shop would be Spider-Man sitting at the coffee/donut shop that MJ works at Ned and MJ would be talking by the counter similar to how they did at the end of no way home Peter would look over at the time and realize he needs to go to his next class cause he’s still in high school MJ and Ned realize this as well.they leave and make their way to school. (This is on camera.) peter makes his way to school maybe stopping a mugging on the way there during chemistry class he would sit next to net. They would say hello and introduce themselves. They were over the movie. They would be building the relationship back, not fully realizing that Peter knows almost everything about him. Peter would do everything in his power to get that friendship back. every now and then never would notice. Peter sang an inside joke. He doesn’t remember making or him leaving and Spider-Man showing up one thing to know this movie doesn’t have a feeling it’s mostly just Spider-Man being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man no big giant purple jellybean in space nothing like that around the end of the movie they would be hanging out on the same rooftop that they always did before everyone’s mind was erased Ned ask him do you feel like we’ve done this before or do you feel sick for déjà vu because I swear I feel like I’ve known you before Peter would respond “every single day” and the screen will go black. The movie wouldn’t have a main big villain. It would just be Spider-Man reconnecting and rebuilding his relationship with Ned because Ned was one of those friends that he has had for years. He’s still in high school and MJ yes she mattered a lot to him but he still in high school and can’t even drink yet she does not in the grand scheme of things matter as much as Ned over the course of the film, they would become good friends. Maybe if there was a spinoff movie of this that would be Ned finds out that Peter is Spider-Man.

# Best Spring Tea 2025: Expert Buying Guide

Spring tea, the first harvest of the year, is revered for its delicate flavors and remarkable freshness. After a period of dormancy during winter, the tea plants burst forth wiht tender new shoots, brimming with nutrients and creating a uniquely vibrant brew. For tea enthusiasts, this marks a highly-anticipated season, offering a rare possibility too savor the year's most remarkable leaves.

This guide provides an in-depth look at the best spring teas expected for 2025, highlighting key characteristics, benefits, and comparisons to help you make an informed decision. Discover which spring teas offer the most outstanding taste, aroma, and overall quality to elevate your tea-drinking experience.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of spring tea is directly influenced by several crucial factors, including the specific cultivar used, the elevation of the tea garden, and the expertise of the tea producers. Knowing these features helps consumers select the right tea for their optimal satisfaction.

**Harvest Timing:** Spring tea is classified by the time of its harvest. Early spring teas,like Ming Qian (pre-Qingming) and Yu Qian (pre-Grain Rain),are particularly prized. ming Qian tea, harvested before the Qingming Festival (around April 5th), consists of the youngest, most tender buds, offering the highest concentration of flavor compounds. Yu Qian tea is harvested before the Grain Rain solar term (around april 20th), representing a slightly later but still highly desirable harvest.

**Tea Cultivar:** different tea cultivars possess distinct characteristics that contribute to the final flavor profile. Long Jing, a famous green tea, utilizes unique variations of the Camellia sinensis plant yielding sweet, nutty infusions. Bi Luo Chun, another green tea staple, is frequently enough sourced from the 'Qun Ti Zhong' cultivar, creating a pronounced floral bouquet. Understanding the cultivar can guide your expectations and help you select a tea in line with your preferences.**Elevation and Terroir:** Tea grown at higher elevations frequently enough exhibits a more complex flavor owing to cooler temperatures and greater moisture. These environmental factors slow down leaf growth,concentrating flavors into the smaller leaves. The specific climate, soil composition, and surrounding vegetation (terroir) also contribute significantly to the unique character of the tea, influencing its aroma, taste, and body.

**Processing Method:** The type of spring tea (green, white, oolong, etc.) influences its inherent characteristics including flavor, aroma, and mouthfeel. Green teas like Long Jing are pan-fired or steamed to prevent oxidation, preserving its grassy, vegetal notes. Oolong teas undergo partial oxidization which provides a wider array of potential flavors that can include fruity, floral, or roasted notes depending on the specific variety and degree of fermentation.

Key features of the best spring teas include:

   Plump,unopened or minimally opened leaves
   Fresh,vibrant aroma
   Clear,bright liquor (tea infusion)
   Complex,nuanced flavors

## Core Benefits

Drinking spring tea offers multiple benefits that stretch beyond the delicious sensory experience. These include the heightened flavor profile which is a characteristic of early harvests, as well as a wealth of health benefits associated with the increased levels of nutrients and antioxidants that come from the early harvest’s tender buds.

**Enhanced Flavor and Aroma:** Spring teas are known for their exceptional flavor and aroma. The tender young leaves contain a higher concentration of amino acids, such as theanine, which contribute to a sweeter, smoother taste with minimal bitterness. The aromatic compounds are also more pronounced, providing a richer and more satisfying sensory experience.

**Increased Antioxidant Content:** Spring tea boasts a high concentration of antioxidants, like catechins, which combat free radicals in the body and have been linked to numerous health benefits. Regular consumption of spring tea can contribute to overall well-being by reducing oxidative stress and supporting a healthy immune system. Scientific studies point to catechin compounds helping to combat a range of health issues.

**Improved Mental Clarity and Focus:** The combination of caffeine and theanine in spring tea promotes a state of relaxed alertness.caffeine provides a gentle energy boost,while theanine enhances focus and reduces anxiety by modulating brain activity. This synergistic effect allows you to stay alert and focused without the jitters often associated with coffee.

**Enhanced Mood and Relaxation:** The act of brewing and savoring a cup of spring tea can be profoundly relaxing. The warm beverage soothes the body, and the delicate aromas stimulate the senses. Additionally, theanine has been shown to promote relaxation and elevate mood, helping to reduce stress and enhance overall well-being.

## faqs Section

When buying spring tea, consumers commonly have several questions regarding optimal brewing parameters, storage methods, and expected quality. These topics help guarantee the best possible brewing and enjoyment experience for novices and experts alike.

**What is the best way to brew spring tea?**
The ideal brewing method depends on the type of tea. Green teas like Long Jing should be brewed with lower water temperatures (around 170-180°F or 77-82°C) to prevent bitterness, and a shorter steep time (1-2 minutes is best). Oolong teas can handle higher temperatures (around 190-200°F or 88-93°C) and longer steep times (2-3 minutes). White teas benefit from slightly cooler water than oolongs with a steep time of around 3 minutes.

**How should I store my spring tea to maintain its freshness?**
To preserve the delicate flavors and aroma of spring tea, it is essential to store it properly. Keep tea in an airtight container away from light, moisture, and strong odors. A cool, dark storage place, such as a pantry or cupboard, is ideal. Avoid storing tea near spices or other strong-smelling items that can contaminate its character.

**How can I tell if my spring tea is of good quality?**
High-quality spring tea possesses several key indicators. Look for plump, whole leaves with minimal breakage. The dry leaves should have a vibrant color and a fresh, appealing aroma. When brewed, the tea liquor should be clear and bright, with a smooth, well-balanced flavor and long-lasting aroma.

**How long does spring tea typically last?**
The ideal consumption window for spring tea is within the year of its production. However, with proper storage, it can retain its quality for up to 18 months. Over time,the tea may lose some of its aroma and flavor intensity,but it will still be drinkable. It's always best to check the tea regularly for any signs of degradation, such as mustiness or off-odors.

1l6wyhl,https://youtu.be/cq-8o_JC8kE,3 Very Scary TRUE North Sentinel Island Horror Stories,"# ""Shipwreck at Sentinel"":

I was a deckhand on the Primrose, a rusty old freighter hauling cargo from Hong Kong across the Bay of Bengal. It was August 1981, and we’d been at sea for over a week, the engine’s drone and the creak of the ship’s hull lulling us into a routine. I was in the mess hall, nursing a cup of bitter coffee, the metal table cool under my elbows. Tommy, a wiry kid new to the crew, was across from me, joking about how he’d spend his pay at the next port. Big John, the first mate, sat nearby, flipping through a tattered magazine. Then the ship lurched violently. My coffee spilled, scalding my hand. Plates and cups crashed to the floor, and a deep, grinding screech tore through the air, like metal claws raking the hull.“Reef!” the captain’s voice boomed over the intercom. “All hands to stations! We’re grounded!” His words were sharp, urgent. I stumbled to my feet, heart racing, and followed Tommy and Big John to the deck. The ship was tilted, leaning hard to starboard, waves slapping against the hull. The horizon was off-kilter, and in the distance, I saw land—a small island, its shore lined with white sand and a wall of dense, dark jungle that seemed to swallow the light.“What’s that place?” I asked, gripping the railing to steady myself. The metal was cold, slick with spray.Big John lifted his binoculars, his thick fingers trembling as he focused. He lowered them slowly, his face pale. “North Sentinel Island,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “Home to the Sentinelese. Uncontacted tribe. They don’t take kindly to outsiders.”“Who are they?” Tommy asked, his eyes wide, his usual grin gone.“People who’ve lived there for thousands of years,” Big John said. “No one’s ever made contact without trouble. They’ll kill to protect their island. Arrows, spears, stones. The Indian government forbids anyone from getting within three miles.”I swallowed hard, my throat dry. We weren’t three miles away. The island was close—too close—maybe a hundred yards, the reef holding us like a trap. The jungle stared back, its tangled vines and towering trees hiding whatever lived inside. My skin prickled, like the island itself was watching us.The captain, a grizzled man with gray stubble and tired eyes, gathered us on deck. “Radio’s down,” he said, his voice tight. “Water got into the wiring when we hit the reef. We’re stuck until we fix it or someone finds us. Check the equipment, secure the deck, and keep your eyes on that island. Don’t do anything to provoke them.”“Provoke who?” Tommy asked, his voice shaking.“The Sentinelese,” the captain said. “If they come, stay low. Don’t shout, don’t wave. We don’t want a fight we can’t win.”We scattered, checking the ship. I helped Tommy inspect the radio room, but the equipment was a mess—wires frayed, panels sparking, soaked from a leak in the hull. “This is useless,” Tommy muttered, tossing a screwdriver onto the table. “We’re cut off.”“Keep trying,” I said, but my hands were shaking too. Every creak of the ship made me jump, expecting something—someone—to appear.By late afternoon, they came. I was on deck, coiling ropes to keep busy, when Big John grabbed my arm. “Look,” he whispered, pointing to the shore. Figures emerged from the jungle, stepping onto the beach. They were small, maybe five feet tall, with dark skin glistening in the light. Their hair was wild, matted, and their bodies were streaked with red and white paint, like war markings. They carried bows strung with taut strings, arrows with sharp stone tips, and spears carved from wood. Some held stone axes, their edges glinting. I counted at least twenty, maybe thirty, standing in a line, staring at us. Their eyes were hard, unblinking, like they were measuring us.“They see us,” Tommy said, his voice barely audible. He gripped a coil of rope like it could protect him.“Don’t move,” Big John hissed. “Don’t even breathe loud.”The captain joined us, his binoculars pressed to his face. “They’re not moving yet,” he said. “But they’re watching. Get anything you can use—pipes, tools, anything heavy. Keep it out of sight. We don’t show weapons unless we have to.”We rummaged below deck, grabbing what we could. I found a heavy steel wrench, its weight reassuring but useless against arrows. Tommy clutched a length of pipe, his hands trembling so bad he nearly dropped it. Big John carried a fire axe, his face set like he was ready for war. My stomach churned as I imagined those arrows flying, piercing skin, the pain of a stone-tipped spear.That night, we took shifts watching the shore. I stood on deck with Tommy, the darkness thick around us, the only light from our ship’s dim lanterns. The island was a black silhouette, but then I heard it—a low, rhythmic chant, rising and falling like a pulse. My skin crawled. I squinted and saw flickers of fire on the beach, shadows of figures moving, maybe dancing, maybe preparing. The chant grew louder, a strange, guttural sound that made my chest tight.“They’re still there,” I whispered to Tommy, my voice shaking.“What are they doing?” he asked, his eyes wide in the dark.“Warning us,” Big John said, joining us. “They’ve killed before. Fishermen, explorers, anyone who gets too close. They don’t want us here.”I gripped my wrench tighter, my palms sweaty. “What if they come for us?”“We hold them off,” Big John said, but his voice lacked conviction. “We just need to last until help comes.”The next morning, the situation worsened. I woke to shouts from the deck. “Canoes!” someone yelled. I ran up, my heart pounding, and saw them—small wooden boats, each carrying three or four Sentinelese, paddling toward us. Their shouts carried over the water, sharp and angry, in a language that sounded like nothing I’d ever heard. One man stood in the lead canoe, his body painted red from head to toe, waving a spear. His eyes locked on us, fierce and unyielding. An arrow shot from another canoe, whistling through the air and embedding in the ship’s railing with a sharp thud.“Get down!” the captain shouted. We dropped behind the railing, my knees hitting the deck hard. Another arrow struck, splintering wood nearby. I peeked over the edge, my breath ragged. The canoes were closer now, maybe fifty yards out, circling like sharks.“They’re going to attack,” Tommy said, his voice high with panic. “They’re going to kill us!”“Shut up and stay low,” Big John snapped. “They’re testing us.”“Testing us?” I said, my voice cracking. “That arrow wasn’t a test!”“They want us scared,” the captain said, crouching beside us. “They want us to know we’re not welcome. Keep your heads down and don’t give them a reason to come closer.”The canoes circled all day, never close enough to board but never far enough to let us breathe easy. Each shout, each arrow that hit the ship, sent a jolt of fear through me. I kept imagining them climbing the hull, their painted faces appearing over the railing, spears raised. We tried the radio again, tearing apart panels, splicing wires, but it was hopeless. The equipment was dead, and we were alone.That evening, the captain gathered us in the mess hall. His face was haggard, eyes sunken from lack of sleep. “We’ve sent a distress signal before the radio died,” he said. “Someone will notice we’re missing. We just need to hold out.”“How long?” I asked, my voice hoarse.“Days, maybe,” he said, looking away. “Just stay sharp. No one goes on deck alone.”Tommy leaned close to me, his breath shaky. “What if they come at night? We can’t see them in the dark.”“Don’t think about it,” I said, but I was thinking the same thing. The jungle, the chants, the arrows—it all felt like a nightmare we couldn’t wake from.By the third day, I was a wreck. My eyes burned from staying awake, my body ached from crouching and hiding. The Sentinelese hadn’t stopped. More canoes appeared, maybe twelve now, and on the beach, they were building rafts—bigger ones, lashed together with vines and branches. I watched through binoculars, my hands trembling, as they worked with purpose, their movements quick and precise.“They’re planning something,” Big John said, his voice grim. “Those rafts aren’t for fishing. They’re coming for us.”“What do we do?” Tommy asked, his face pale. “We can’t fight them all.”“We don’t,” the captain said. “We make it hard for them to board. Block the ladders, secure the hatches. If they try, we push them back.”We spent the day fortifying the ship, dragging crates and barrels to block access points. My arms ached, but the work kept my mind off the rafts. At sunset, the chanting started again, louder, more urgent. I stood watch with Big John, the sky darkening, the fires on the beach glowing brighter. The rafts were nearly done, stacked on the shore, ready to launch.“They’ll come at dawn,” Big John said, his voice low. “They’re waiting for light.”I didn’t sleep that night. None of us did. We sat on deck, clutching our makeshift weapons, listening to the chants, the rhythmic slap of waves, the occasional shout from the island. My heart pounded so hard I felt it in my throat. I kept seeing those painted faces in my mind, their eyes burning with anger, their arrows aimed at us.On the fourth day, I woke to a new sound—not chants, but a distant thump, growing louder. I stumbled to the deck, my legs weak, and saw a speck in the sky. A helicopter. The Indian Coast Guard. “They’re here!” I shouted, my voice raw. The crew cheered, weak and ragged, as the chopper approached, its rotors deafening.The Sentinelese saw it too. Their canoes stopped circling, and they paddled back to shore, shouting louder, angrier. Arrows flew toward the helicopter, arcing through the air but falling short, splashing into the sea. The chopper hovered above us, a rope ladder dropping down. We scrambled up, one by one, the wind from the blades whipping our clothes, stinging our faces.I was last. As I grabbed the ladder, my hands slippery with sweat, I looked back at the island. The Sentinelese lined the beach, waving spears, their faces contorted with rage. The jungle behind them seemed alive, its shadows shifting, like it was part of their defiance. An arrow shot past, grazing the ladder, and I climbed faster, my heart in my throat.In the helicopter, we collapsed, breathless, staring at each other in silence. The island shrank below, the Primrose a broken relic on the reef. The jungle loomed, vast and impenetrable, hiding the Sentinelese and their secrets. We’d escaped, but the fear clung to me, heavy as the wrench I’d dropped. Those faces, those chants, the island itself—it felt like a warning etched into my bones. North Sentinel didn’t want us, and it made sure we’d never forget. Even now, I see that beach in my dreams, the painted figures watching, waiting, as the jungle swallows the light.



# ""Skulls in the Sand"":

I’d always been obsessed with the edges of the world, places where civilization hadn’t left its mark. As a journalist, I’d built a career chasing stories that made people stop and think—tales of forgotten tribes, hidden cultures. North Sentinel Island was the ultimate challenge. A tiny, jungle-choked island in the Bay of Bengal, home to the Sentinelese, a tribe that’s rejected the outside world for thousands of years. I’d read about fishermen who drifted too close, their boats attacked, their bodies left on the shore as warnings. The Indian government banned all contact, but that only fueled my need to see it for myself. Not to meet them, just to capture their existence from a safe distance. At least, that’s what I told myself.I found two local boatmen in Port Blair, Anil and Deepak, who agreed to take me near the island. It took days of convincing and a stack of cash to overcome their hesitation. They knew the stories—everyone in the Andamans did. The Sentinelese didn’t negotiate. They didn’t warn. They killed. But I was stubborn, maybe arrogant, and I thought I could stay out of their reach.We set out in a small, weathered fishing boat, its paint chipped from years at sea. My backpack held a notebook, a camera with a long lens, and a pair of binoculars. Anil sat at the bow, scanning the horizon, his jaw tight. Deepak steered, his hands gripping the wheel like he was holding onto his own courage. The sea was calm, the air thick with salt and silence. I tried to break the tension.“How far is it?” I asked, adjusting my camera strap.“Too far and not far enough,” Anil muttered, not looking at me. “You sure about this? Last chance to turn back.”“I’m sure,” I said, though my stomach twisted. “We’re not landing. Just getting close enough for a few shots.”Deepak snorted. “Close enough is too close with them. You read about those fishermen? Two of them, 2006. Washed up too near the island. The Sentinelese didn’t even let their bodies be taken back.”I nodded, pretending I wasn’t rattled. I’d read about it—two men killed, their bodies tied to stakes on the beach. A helicopter sent to retrieve them was driven off by arrows. But that was years ago, and we’d be careful. I kept telling myself [that.As](http://that.As) we approached, the island came into view, a dark mass of jungle rising from the sea. It looked untouched, ancient, like something out of a forgotten world. The shoreline was fringed with white sand, but beyond that, the trees were so dense they seemed to swallow the light. I raised my binoculars, my hands unsteady, and scanned the beach. That’s when I saw them—poles driven into the sand, each topped with what looked like skulls. Some were weathered, barely recognizable, but others seemed fresher, their shapes too human for comfort. My breath caught.“Did you see those?” I whispered.Anil nodded, his face grim. “Told you. They don’t play games. Those are warnings.”“We’re not landing,” I repeated, more to myself than to him. “We’ll stay far enough out.”Deepak shook his head. “Far enough doesn’t exist here. They’ve got bows that can hit a boat half a kilometer away.”I swallowed hard but set up my camera anyway, adjusting the lens to zoom in on the shore. The jungle was silent, no birds, no rustling leaves—just an oppressive stillness that made my skin crawl. We drifted, the engine off to avoid drawing attention. Minutes stretched into what felt like hours. I kept my eyes glued to the viewfinder, searching for any sign of life.Then, a faint sound broke the quiet—a low, rhythmic thumping, like drums echoing through the trees. My heart lurched. “Do you hear that?” I asked, lowering the camera.Anil’s eyes widened. “That’s them. They know we’re here.”“We should go,” Deepak said, his voice sharp. “Now.”“Just a minute,” I said, my voice trembling. “I need something for the story.”Before they could argue, a figure stepped from the jungle onto the beach. He was tall, his body lean and muscular, his skin painted with white streaks that made him look otherworldly. Another figure joined him, then another, until a dozen men stood in a line, each holding a bow or a spear. They didn’t move, didn’t shout—just stared at us, their eyes dark and unblinking.“They see us,” Deepak whispered, his hands fumbling for the engine’s pull cord. “We’re too close.”I couldn’t look away. My camera was up again, my finger trembling on the shutter. I zoomed in, catching the details—the intricate patterns of paint on their faces, the taut strings of their bows, the sharp tips of their spears. They were beautiful and terrifying, like warriors from a time before history.An arrow cut through the air, landing in the water just feet from the boat. The splash jolted me. Another followed, then a third, one striking the hull with a dull thunk. I froze, my camera slipping from my hands to dangle by its strap.“Start the engine!” Anil shouted, scrambling to the back of the boat.Deepak yanked the cord, but the engine coughed and died. “It’s not catching!” he yelled.More arrows came, faster now. One grazed Anil’s shoulder, tearing his shirt and drawing blood. He gasped, clutching the wound, his face twisted in pain. I ducked behind the boat’s low railing, my heart pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears.“They’re in the water!” Deepak cried.I peered over the edge and saw them—five, maybe six Sentinelese swimming toward us, their strokes powerful and silent. Their painted faces broke the surface, their eyes locked on us, spears clutched in their hands. They moved like predators, closing the distance with terrifying speed.“Do something!” Anil shouted, pressing his hand against his bleeding shoulder.I grabbed a metal pole from the boat’s floor, my hands slick with sweat. It felt useless against spears and arrows, but it was all I had. One of the swimmers reached the boat, his fingers curling over the edge. His face was close now, his eyes burning with a fury I couldn’t comprehend. He raised his spear, the tip glinting.“Get back!” I yelled, swinging the pole. It hit his arm, and he slipped back into the water with a splash, but another was already climbing aboard, his spear aimed at Deepak.I lunged, shoving the pole against his chest. He stumbled, falling backward, but more were coming. Arrows kept raining down, one slicing through my sleeve, grazing my arm. The pain was sharp, but adrenaline kept me moving.Deepak yanked the cord again, and this time, the engine roared to life. The boat surged forward, throwing me against the railing. I clung to it, watching as the swimmers fell behind, their shapes swallowed by the sea. Arrows still flew, some splashing harmlessly into the water, others pinging off the boat’s hull.We sped away, the island shrinking in the distance. I looked back, my chest heaving. The Sentinelese lined the shore now, more than I could count, their bows raised, arrows pointed at us. They didn’t chase us further, but their message was clear: we weren’t welcome.We didn’t stop until the island was gone from sight, just a memory on the horizon. Anil sat slumped, his shoulder wrapped in a torn piece of cloth, blood soaking through. Deepak’s hands shook as he steered, his face pale.“You happy now?” Anil snapped, his voice hoarse. “You got what you wanted?”I looked at my camera, lying in a puddle of seawater on the boat’s floor. The lens was cracked, the screen dark. I pried open the compartment, hoping to save the memory card, but it was ruined, the data lost. Hours of planning, days of travel, and we’d come away with nothing but scars.“I’m sorry,” I said, my voice breaking. “I didn’t think it’d be like this.”“You didn’t listen,” Deepak said, his eyes fixed ahead. “They don’t want your cameras, your stories. They just want to be left alone.”Back in Port Blair, I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw those skull-topped poles, those painted faces, those arrows slicing through the air. My arm stung where the arrow had grazed it, a shallow cut that would heal, unlike the deeper wound in my mind. I’d gone looking for a story, but what I found was a warning etched in bone and blood: some places aren’t meant to be seen.I tried to write the article, but the words wouldn’t come. How could I explain the terror of those moments, the weight of knowing I’d crossed a line? The Sentinelese weren’t a story to be told—they were a people fighting to stay hidden, and I’d disrespected that. I put my notebook away, my camera too, and swore I’d never go back. Their island, their rules. I’d learned that the hard way.The memory of that night clings to me, a shadow I can’t shake. The thump of drums, the whistle of arrows, the eyes that saw right through me—they’re part of me now, a reminder that curiosity can cost more than you’re willing to pay.



# ""We Escape Tonight"":

I sat hunched in the damp, suffocating cell of Port Blair’s penal colony, the air thick with the stench of salt, sweat, and rotting wood. The stone walls, slick with grime and etched with the scratches of past prisoners, pressed in around me. My hands trembled as I leaned toward Raj and Arjun, my only allies in this forsaken place. “Tonight,” I whispered, my voice barely audible over the distant clink of chains and the groans of other inmates. “We escape tonight, or we die here.”Raj, a lean man with sharp eyes and nimble fingers that could pick any lock, glanced at the barred window high above. Moonlight barely slipped through, casting faint, wavering shadows on his tense, sweat-streaked face. “You’re out of your mind,” he hissed, his voice low but sharp. “The guards patrol every hour. They’ll catch us, and we’ll be flogged—or worse, strung up in the yard.”Arjun, older, with a scholar’s weary gaze and a gray-streaked beard that hung unevenly from his thin face, placed a steady hand on Raj’s shoulder. “Stay in this cage, and we’re already dead,” he said softly, his voice calm but heavy with conviction. “Out there, we have a chance. A small one, but a chance.”I nodded, my throat tight, my mouth dry from days of meager rations. For weeks, we’d planned this, ever since I overheard a guard muttering about a hidden cove where supply boats docked, often unguarded at night. Our plan was desperate: steal a raft, slip into the sea, and pray for land. The Andaman Islands were a maze of green and blue, scattered like forgotten jewels, but freedom was worth the risk. I clung to that thought, though doubt gnawed at my insides like a starving rat.We waited, listening to the guards’ heavy footsteps, their boots scuffing the stone corridor. Their lanterns cast long, flickering shadows through the bars, dancing like ghosts on the cell walls. My heart pounded so loudly I feared they’d hear it. Raj kept rubbing his scarred wrist, where the shackles had bitten deep during his first year here. “What if the raft doesn’t hold?” he muttered, his voice trembling. “What if we’re trading one death for another?”“Then we die free,” I said, meeting his eyes, trying to sound braver than I felt. He looked away, jaw tight, his fingers twitching nervously.When the footsteps faded and the lanterns’ glow vanished, Arjun gave a sharp nod. We moved fast, prying up a floorboard we’d loosened over weeks with a shard of metal I’d smuggled from the quarry. The wood creaked, and I froze, expecting a guard’s shout, but none came. The dirt beneath was cool, smelling of earth and faint hope—a cruel tease of the world beyond these walls. I crawled through the narrow tunnel first, my elbows scraping jagged stone, the air growing damp and heavy, pressing against my chest. Raj’s quick, panicked breaths and Arjun’s low grunts followed me, echoing in the tight space.We emerged near the shore, the sea stretching vast and dark, its surface glinting faintly under the stars. The raft, a patchwork of driftwood, stolen planks, and frayed rope, lay hidden under palm fronds behind a cluster of rocks. My hands trembled as I dragged it to the water’s edge, waves lapping hungrily at my feet, cold and biting. “Hurry,” I urged, glancing at the colony’s distant lights, faint but menacing, like eyes watching us.Raj hesitated, feet planted in the sand, his silhouette tense against the dark sea. “This is madness,” he said, voice cracking, his hands clenched into fists. “We don’t even know where we’re going. What if there’s nothing out there?”Arjun climbed onto the raft, his movements slow but deliberate, his scholar’s hands gripping the ropes with surprising strength. “Anywhere but here,” he said, his voice steady despite his gaunt frame. “Get on, Raj, or stay and rot.”Raj cursed under his breath, a low, desperate sound, but followed, his steps unsteady. I pushed the raft into the surf, leaping aboard as the current caught us, the wood creaking under our weight. The colony faded into darkness, its lights swallowed by the night, and for a fleeting moment, I felt a surge of hope. We were free.Days melted into one another, the sea a relentless torment. No food, no water. My lips cracked, tasting of salt and blood, each breath a dry rasp. My skin burned raw, peeling in strips, and my head throbbed with every heartbeat, a dull, endless pain. Raj slumped against the raft’s edge, his eyes hollow, his once-sharp features sunken. “We’re going to die out here,” he whispered, his voice barely audible over the waves’ rhythmic slap. “This was a mistake.”“Shut up,” I snapped, though fear clawed my gut, sharp and cold. My tongue felt like sandpaper, and my vision blurred at the edges. Arjun, weaker now, his face pale and slick with sweat, stared at the horizon, hands gripping the ropes to keep from collapsing. “There,” he croaked, pointing with a trembling finger, his voice barely a breath. “Land.”A faint green line appeared, growing into an island, its beaches white and inviting, fringed with dense, dark jungle. Relief surged in my chest, but unease settled beside it, heavy and cold. The island looked untouched, too perfect, like a trap disguised as paradise. “What is this place?” I asked, my voice hoarse, barely carrying over the waves.“No idea,” Arjun said, squinting, his eyes sunken but sharp with hope. “But it’s land. It’s hope.”As we neared, the raft struck something hard—a reef, jagged and unforgiving. The wood splintered with a sickening crack, and a wave slammed into us, cold and brutal. Raj screamed, his arms flailing as the sea dragged him under, his face a mask of terror. I lunged, fingers brushing his sleeve, but he was gone, swallowed by the churning water. “Raj!” I shouted, my voice lost in the waves’ roar, my heart sinking with him.Arjun clung to me, blood streaming from a gash on his leg where the reef had torn him, the red mixing with the sea’s foam. “Keep going!” he gasped, his grip weak, his face twisted in pain. The raft was breaking apart, planks snapping, ropes fraying. We had no choice. We swam, the current pulling us toward shore, every stroke a battle against exhaustion. My arms burned, lungs screaming, saltwater stinging my eyes, but the beach grew closer, its sand a pale promise.We collapsed on the shore, gasping, grains sticking to our wet, bleeding skin. I lay there, chest heaving, staring at the jungle’s edge. It was too quiet—no birds, no breeze, just an oppressive stillness that made my skin prickle. The air smelled of salt and something sharper, like decay hidden beneath the green. “We made it,” I said, my voice ragged, trying to convince myself.Arjun groaned, clutching his leg, blood seeping between his fingers, staining the sand a dark, ugly red. “We’re not safe yet,” he said, his eyes darting to the trees, wide with fear. “Did you hear that?”I froze, listening. A faint rustle, like footsteps on leaves, came from the jungle, deliberate and slow. My heart raced, a cold sweat breaking out despite my exhaustion. “Maybe it’s animals,” I said, but the words felt hollow, a lie I couldn’t believe. The rustling stopped, then started again, closer, more purposeful. “We need to move,” I said, helping Arjun up, his weight heavy against me. His leg dragged, useless, leaving a trail of blood in the sand.We stumbled toward the jungle’s edge, seeking cover, the sand sucking at our feet, slowing every step. I kept glancing back, expecting to see something—someone—emerge from the trees. The jungle loomed, its shadows deep and unwelcoming, branches tangled like a net waiting to trap us. “We shouldn’t be here,” Arjun whispered, his voice trembling, his breath shallow. “This place feels… wrong.”A figure stepped from the trees, silent as a shadow. A man, skin dark, holding a bow with an arrow notched, the tip gleaming sharply. His eyes were cold, unblinking, his face blank, like a mask carved from stone. Another appeared, then another, each with spears or bows, moving with eerie silence, their bare feet leaving no trace in the sand. My stomach twisted, a sick, sinking feeling. They weren’t curious or angry—they were hunters, and we were prey.“Say something,” Arjun hissed, gripping my arm so hard it hurt, his nails digging into my skin. I raised my hands, forcing a smile that felt like a grimace, my lips trembling. “We mean no harm,” I said, my voice shaking, barely audible. “We’re lost. Please, we need help.”They didn’t move, didn’t blink. More emerged, circling us, their footsteps so light they seemed to glide over the sand. My pulse thundered in my ears, my breath coming in short, panicked gasps. “Please,” I said again, louder, desperate. “We don’t want trouble. We just want to live.”An arrow shot past my ear, embedding in a tree with a sharp thud, the sound echoing in my skull. Arjun gasped, clutching me tighter, his body shaking. “Run!” he shouted, but his leg buckled, and he crumpled to the sand, dragging me down with him. I tried to pull him up, my hands slippery with his blood, the metallic smell filling my nose, but the tribesmen tightened their circle, their weapons gleaming, their eyes empty of mercy.“Stay back!” I yelled, my voice cracking with desperation, raw and hoarse. They didn’t flinch, didn’t speak, their silence more terrifying than any shout. A spear grazed Arjun’s side, and he cried out, a sharp, broken sound, blood pooling beneath him, soaking the sand. I dropped to my knees, pressing my hands against the wound, the warm stickiness coating my fingers. “Hold on,” I said, tears burning my eyes, my voice barely a whisper. “Just hold on, Arjun.”He grabbed my wrist, his grip weak, his eyes glassy but fierce. “Go,” he whispered, his voice fading, each word a struggle. “Save yourself.”I wanted to run, but my legs felt heavy, rooted, my body refusing to move. The tribesmen stood like statues, their eyes empty, unfeeling, their weapons poised. An arrow struck my shoulder, the pain white-hot, stealing my breath, sending me sprawling beside Arjun. I gasped, vision swimming, the world tilting. His hand went limp in mine, his chest still, his blood mixing with mine in the sand.The jungle swallowed all sound as the tribesmen raised their weapons, their movements slow, deliberate, like a ritual. I braced for the end, my heart pounding, my shoulder throbbing, but a distant hum broke the silence—a low, unnatural drone, growing louder, cutting through the stillness like a blade. The tribesmen froze, their heads turning toward the sea, their blank faces showing a flicker of unease, a crack in their predatory calm.I followed their gaze, gasping through the pain, my vision blurry but clearing just enough to see. A boat, small but sturdy, its hull painted a faded gray, was approaching, its engine growling, the sound foreign and jarring in this silent place. Its bow cut through the waves, a faint lantern swinging on its deck, casting a weak, yellow glow. The tribesmen shifted, their bows still raised, but their attention split, their eyes darting between me and the boat.I crawled toward the water, dragging myself over the sand, each movement agony, my shoulder screaming, blood dripping down my arm. “Help!” I screamed, my voice raw, cracking, barely human. The tribesmen moved, arrows flying toward the boat, splashing into the sea with soft plunks. But the boat pressed closer, undeterred, its engine louder now, a lifeline in the chaos.A man leaned over the boat’s edge, his face weathered, his eyes wide with urgency. “Hold on!” he shouted, his voice carrying over the waves. “We’re coming!” Another man, younger, scrambled to lower a rope ladder, his hands fumbling but quick. Arrows splashed around them, one striking the boat’s hull with a dull thud, but they didn’t stop.I stumbled into the shallows, waves lapping at my knees, cold and sharp, my strength fading. The tribesmen hesitated, some lowering their bows, others stepping back toward the jungle, their movements uncertain, as if the boat’s presence disrupted their resolve. I reached out, my fingers brushing the ladder, slick with seaweed and salt. Hands grabbed me, strong and calloused, pulling me aboard, my body limp, pain blurring everything.I collapsed on the deck, the wood hard against my back, the engine’s vibration rumbling through me. “You’re safe now,” the older man said, his voice gruff but kind, his hands pressing a cloth to my shoulder to stem the bleeding. “Saw your raft’s wreckage from a distance,” he added, glancing at the sea. “We were charting reefs, didn’t expect to find anyone out here.”The younger man, his face pale, pointed at the island. “Those people… they don’t want visitors,” he said, his voice shaking. “We’ve heard stories. No one comes here.”I turned my head, my vision swimming, and saw Arjun’s body on the beach, motionless, the tribesmen retreating into the jungle, their eyes still locked on us, cold and unyielding. The boat’s engine roared, pulling us away, the island shrinking, its white sand and dark trees fading into a haze. My shoulder throbbed, my body weak, but I was alive. The men’s voices faded as I slipped into darkness, the hum of the engine a faint promise that I’d escaped a place that didn’t forgive intruders.",1,1749447588.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

1l6ww2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1l6ww2x/sick_day_final_part/,"""Sick Day"" Final Part","*I found one of Dad’s old flannel shirts today. The green one with the ripped cuff he always wore when working on the truck.*

*It still smelled like him.*

*I sat in the garage holding it for almost an hour. Just breathing.*

*And then I looked up at the ceiling… and I could feel the attic above me.*

*I need to keep going. I need to get through it.*

*Thursday. 2003*

I came into the kitchen around 7:45AM, my cast already starting to itch and the whole left side of my body sore like I’d gone ten rounds with a semi-truck.

The sun was shining through the curtains, warm and golden, like nothing was wrong. Like nothing had ever happened.

Mom was at the stove, poking at eggs she clearly didn’t want to eat. Her hair was pulled into a low, messy bun, and she had that *tight smile* on her face. The one she wore when things were bad, but she didn’t want me to know they were bad.

Dad sat at the table, already showered and dressed, black coffee in front of him. His work boots were beside his chair, unlaced. He hadn’t touched his toast.

Tori sat across from him, pushing a spoon through a bowl of cereal and scowling like we’d personally ruined her life.

“Hey, kiddo,” Mom said when she saw me. “Hungry?”

I shrugged. “Not really.”

I slid into the chair beside Dad and winced as I bumped my cast against the table.

He glanced over, then reached out and gently adjusted my plate so I wouldn’t have to move it.

“How’s the wrist?” he asked.

“Sore.”

He nodded. “Doctor says it’s a clean break. You’re lucky.”

I didn’t feel lucky.

I felt like something had reached out of the dark and tried to pull me back in.

Tori let out a loud sigh and crossed her arms. “So what—he just gets to stay home all week now?”

Mom shot her a look. “Victoria.”

“What? I’m just saying—*some* of us have finals next week.”

Dad sipped his coffee. “The doctor gave him a note for the rest of the week.”

Tori rolled her eyes. “Of course he did.”

“He has a broken arm,” Mom said, her voice thin.

“And a head full of ghosts,” Tori mumbled under her breath.

“What was that?” Dad asked, his voice sharp.

“Nothing,” she said, but she didn’t look at me. Just stared at her spoon like it had personally offended her.

Dad sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. “I have to go back in today. I told Jim I’d cover the shop until at least Friday.”

Mom nodded quietly.

“We can’t leave him here alone,” Dad added. “Not with his arm like that.”

“I’ll stay,” Mom said. “I’ll call out.”

“No.” He shook his head. “You’ve already missed two shifts. I called Mom this morning. She’s gonna come over and sit with him today.”

I froze.

“Grandma?” I asked, trying not to sound *too* twelve about it.

“She’ll be here by ten,” Dad said, like that was the end of it.

I looked at Mom, hoping she might object—but she didn’t. She just smiled, soft and sad. “You’ll like the company. She’ll probably bring muffins.”

Tori snorted.

I just stared down at my plate, appetite gone.

I didn’t want muffins.

I wanted someone to believe me.

After everyone left, the house went quiet.

I watched through the front window as Dad backed the truck out of the driveway, Mom in the passenger seat, Tori slouched in the back. She gave me one last dramatic look before disappearing behind the glare of the window glass.

I listened to the garage door groan shut.

Then silence.

Just me.

I turned on the TV in the living room and laid down on the couch, cast resting on a pillow. The cartoons were bright and loud, but they didn’t do much to quiet the rest of the house. The attic was still up there. Still waiting.

I glanced at the clock. Grandma wasn’t supposed to be there for another hour and a half.

I’d just started zoning out to *Pokemon* reruns when—

*Knock knock knock.*

Three quick knocks at the front door.

I sat up fast, heart racing.

Not because I was scared, but because *no one* ever knocked that early unless it was a delivery or something bad.

I peeked through the peephole.

Three kids stood on the porch.

Zack, Taylor, and Blake.

My friends.

Well—sort of.

We ate lunch together, played *Super Smash Bros.* whenever someone had a sleepover, and texted more than we actually talked in class. They weren’t the most popular kids, but neither was I.

Zack had a backpack slung over one shoulder and was holding a manila folder. Blake stood with his hands in his hoodie pockets, his hair a mess like he barely made it out of bed. And Taylor—short, sharp-eyed, in a jean jacket way too big for her—had a Yoo-hoo in one hand and a silver pack of Pop-Tarts in the other.

I opened the door with my good hand.

“Duuude,” Taylor said, eyebrows raising as she looked at my cast. “You actually broke it?”

“No way,” Blake muttered, leaning closer like he was gonna poke it. “You fell out of the *attic*?”

“Yeah,” I said, stepping aside. “You guys wanna come in?”

They didn’t need a second invitation.

They crashed into the living room like we did every Saturday. Zack handed me the folder.

“Ms. C said to give you your makeup work,” he said. “We told her we’d stop by before school.”

“And my mom only said yes ‘cause I told her you were *tragically injured,*” Taylor added, tossing the extra Pop-Tarts she had in her backpack onto my lap. “Strawberry. You’re welcome.”

I sat down and pulled my blanket over my legs.

“Thanks, guys. Seriously.”

“Did it hurt?” Blake asked, flopping into the recliner. “Falling, I mean?”

“Yeah.”

“Like a lot?”

“Like someone tried to rip my arm off.”

Taylor let out a low, long whistle. “Metal.”

Zack gave her a look. “He could’ve died.”

“Still metal,” she shrugged, cracking open her Yoo-hoo.

Then Zack tilted his head. “Wait… why were you even up there?”

I hesitated.

I looked at them—all three.

They weren’t jerks. They weren’t like the kids who whispered about me in the hallway. And they’d come all this way, early, before school, just to check on me.

So, I told them.

Everything.

About Mollie barking at the walls. About the noises in the attic at night. About sneaking up there with my lightsaber, and the nest. The scratching. The shape in the dark. The fall. The hand. The attic door *slamming shut on its own.*

Their faces changed.

Taylor sat forward slowly; Pop-Tart half-crushed in her hand now.

Zack didn’t blink.

And Blake said, softly, “Dude… what the hell?”

“You think something’s living up there?” Taylor asked, eyes darting toward the ceiling.

“I don’t think,” I said. “I *know*.”

“It chased you?” Zack asked. “Like—*actually* chased you?”

I nodded.

“I heard it breathe,” I whispered.

They all looked up at once.

The attic was directly above the living room.

And the house suddenly felt smaller. Quieter. Like we’d said something out loud we weren’t supposed to. 

For a long time, nobody spoke.

Then Blake whispered, “What if it’s listening?”

“Don’t say that,” Taylor said, smacking his arm.

“No, seriously.” Blake shifted nervously in his seat. “What if it knows you’re home alone right now?”

“Okay, you’re freaking yourself out,” Zack said. But his eyes hadn’t left the ceiling.

A faint creak echoed from somewhere upstairs.

All three of them jumped.

I clenched my blanket in one hand. “It does that a lot. Usually at night. Sometimes it… moves around.”

Zack stood and grabbed his backpack. “We should go.”

“Dude, come on,” Taylor said. “You’re not gonna leave him here alone with that thing crawling around the attic.”

“We have school,” he said, but his voice was shaking now. “And it’s not like we can do anything about it in the middle of the day.”

Taylor looked over at me.

I could see it in her face. She wanted to help. She just didn’t know how.

“Let’s come back after school,” she said suddenly. “Like, tonight. I’ll ask my mom if I can stay over.”

“Me too,” Blake said. “I’ll tell my dad I’m staying at Zack’s.”

“Why my house?” Zack asked.

“Because you’re boring and trustworthy,” Taylor shot back. “And we’re gonna need someone to bring snacks.”

Zack rolled his eyes but didn’t argue.

I nodded slowly. “Okay. Yeah. Tonight.”

“We’ll bring flashlights,” Blake said. “And, like… salt. Isn’t that a thing?”

“Only if you’re fighting ghosts,” Taylor muttered. “This thing’s not a ghost. It’s something *else.*”

“Okay, well… what *is* it then?”

We all looked at each other.

No one had an answer.

Then—

BANG. BANG. BANG.

We all screamed.

Taylor nearly dropped her Yoo-hoo.

“WHO’S READY FOR MUFFINS?” a voice called through the front door.

“Oh my god,” Blake gasped, clutching his chest. “I’m gonna piss.”

“It’s just my grandma,” I muttered, stumbling to my feet.

I opened the door and there she was: Grandma. Gray sweater. Big smile. A basket of muffins in one hand, an off-brand orange juice jug in the other.

“Oh! I didn’t know you had company!” she beamed.

Taylor stood, adjusting her oversized jacket. “We were just leaving. School. You know.”

“Uh-huh,” Grandma said, eyeing the three of them with that warm, old-lady suspicion that could melt concrete. “Well, I’ll keep an eye on our patient here. Don’t worry.”

Zack cleared his throat. “See you later.”

“After school,” Taylor whispered to me as she passed.

Then she was gone.

All three of them, heading back down the porch and across the lawn, glancing over their shoulders like the house might try to follow.

Grandma shut the door behind them and turned to me, her smile softening.

“You look pale,” she said. “Want to sit with me while I knit? Or would you rather go lay down?”

I stared up at the ceiling.

At the attic.

“I think I’m good right here,” I said quietly.

Grandma made me a grilled cheese and tomato soup and insisted I eat every bite, even though I wasn’t hungry.

She didn’t ask a lot of questions. Just hovered, smiling gently, pouring me juice, tucking the blanket around my legs again even after I kicked it off. She had that quiet, steady kind of love that made you feel guilty for keeping secrets.

After lunch, she flipped through the channels until she landed on a soap opera—something about twins and betrayal and a baby that might be cursed—then settled into the recliner with her knitting needles clacking softly in her lap.

By the time the second commercial break hit, she was out cold. Head tilted, mouth slightly open, one hand still tangled in blue yarn.

The house was quiet again.

Except for the TV.

I left it on and padded down the hall. My wrist still ached, but the pills from the hospital were finally working. I just needed to pee and splash some water on my face.

I pushed open the bathroom door with my good hand and stepped inside.

The door swung closed behind me.

Click.

I turned the faucet on. Let the water run.

And then—

Footsteps.

Fast.

*Slapping* across the hardwood floor outside.

I spun around.

Something hit the bathroom door.

Hard.

The whole thing shuddered on its hinges.

I backed up.

My heart was racing now, pounding in my ears.

Then—

A hand curled around the edge of the door.

Long fingers. Grayish skin. Black, cracked nails.

It gripped the doorframe like it was trying to keep me in.

“No no no—” I whispered, shoving against the door.

It didn’t move.

I pressed my back to the wall, eyes darting around the room, breath catching in my throat.

That’s when I heard it.

A low, rattling breath.

Not from the other side of the door.

From above.

I looked up—slowly.

The vent above the toilet was rattling slightly, the metal slats twitching like something was pressing against them from the inside.

A soft scrape echoed through the vent.

Then a finger.

Then another.

It was crawling out.

The vent cover popped loose with a soft *ping*, clattering to the floor.

Something slid through.

Long limbs. Pale skin. Elbows that bent the wrong way.

It dropped into the bathtub behind the shower curtain with a heavy *thump*.

I couldn’t move.

The room was dead quiet.

Except for the sound of it breathing behind the curtain.

Each breath made the plastic suck in, then puff out again.  
Suck in—puff out.

I could see the shape of it now, faint and twisted behind the floral print.

Then the curtain moved.

Just slightly.

Just enough.

Like it was leaning closer.

I opened my mouth to scream—

The door yanked open.

Light flooded in.

The hallway. Grandma’s voice, faint: “Sweetheart?”

I ran.

Out of the bathroom, past her, down the hall, gasping, heart hammering like it was going to crack through my ribs.

She followed, confused, knitting still wrapped around her wrist.

“What happened?” she called after me. “Are you okay? 

Grandma hurried in behind me, a mess of yarn still tangled around her wrist. “What on earth—? What happened?”

I couldn’t speak at first. My chest was tight. My wrist throbbed. My heart was doing somersaults.

She crouched down beside me, one hand on my shoulder. “Was it your arm again? Did something—?”

“It was in the bathroom,” I whispered.

Her brow furrowed.

“What was, sweetheart?”

“*It.*” I pointed down the hallway. “It grabbed the door. It came through the vent. It dropped into the tub—I saw it. I *heard*it.”

She stood slowly, eyes narrowing just a little.

“I’ll go check.”

“No—don’t—”

But she was already walking. She walked to the kitchen and pulled a large knife from the knife block.

I watched her disappear down the hall, every second stretching out like rubber. I thought maybe I’d hear her scream. Or call for help. Or say something *anything*—

But when she came back, she just shook her head.

“There’s nothing there,” she said gently. “No handprints, no vent cover on the floor, no mess in the tub.”

My stomach twisted.

“That’s not possible,” I said.

Her smile didn’t reach her eyes. “I think you might’ve dozed off and had a nightmare.”

“I was *awake.*”

She didn’t argue.

She just picked up her knitting and settled back into the recliner.

The house stayed quiet for the rest of the afternoon. Too quiet.

By the time my parents got home, I was already standing at the foot of the stairs, waiting for them.

Dad looked exhausted. His eyes were bloodshot, and his uniform shirt had a grease stain down the front.

“You’re still up?” he asked, tossing his keys into the bowl on the side table.

“I need to ask you something.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Yeah?”

I hesitated. Then said, “Can Zack, Taylor, and Blake come over?”

Dad blinked. “Tonight?”

“Just for a little while. Maybe a sleepover. Nothing big.”

He glanced at Mom, who looked at me with that tired mom-face that says *not tonight,* but also *we feel bad for you.*

“I don’t know, bud,” Dad said. “You’re still healing. And I’m beat.”

“They already asked their parents,” I lied quickly. “They’re bringing flashlights and movies. It’s just to hang out. I swear.”

He rubbed his temples. “You sure you’re up for that? After the hospital and—everything?”

I nodded, trying to keep my voice steady. “Yeah. I just… don’t want to be alone tonight.”

Something in that hit him. He didn’t say anything for a moment.

Then he sighed and reached for his phone. “Tell them to be here by nine. Quiet night. No roughhousing.”

I nodded again. “Yes. Thank you.”

He headed for the kitchen. “And don’t go back in the attic. I mean it.”

“I won’t,” I said.

That was a lie too. 

The doorbell rang at 8:47PM.

Blake was the first one through the door, backpack half unzipped, his hoodie sleeves pulled over his hands. “Yo,” he grinned, like we hadn’t just seen each other earlier that morning.

Taylor came in next, wearing flannel pajama pants with little bats on them and carrying a flashlight the size of a baseball bat. “We come bearing snacks and questionable judgment.”

Zack followed with a tote bag full of supplies—flashlights, batteries, two packs of Oreos, and a sketchpad covered in doodles. “My mom gave us Capri Suns, but Taylor chugged most of them in the car.”

I laughed—actually laughed—and stepped back to let them all in.

Then Tori came down the stairs in her tank top and pajama shorts, holding her phone and looking *thoroughly unimpressed*.

Blake froze halfway through dropping his backpack.

“...Hey,” he said, all casual-like, but his voice cracked halfway through it.

Tori raised one eyebrow. “Hey.”

She looked at me. “If these dorks eat all the pringles…”

“Don’t worry,” I said. “We have our own snacks” 

Blake turned to me, “is she going to join us?!” 

 “She’s not invited.”

She rolled her eyes and started walking toward the kitchen. Blake stared after her like she was the sun and he was an unsupervised moth.

“Is she staying home tonight?” he whispered.

“She *lives* here,” Taylor said. “Stop being weird.”

“I’m not being weird,” Blake muttered.

“You literally *stared at her forehead* like it had the answers to the universe.”

“I didn’t—”

“She’s too old for you, Blake,” Zack said, dropping the tote bag with a thud.

“Age is just a number,” Blake replied.

“And restraining orders are just paperwork,” Taylor deadpanned.

We moved into the living room and laid everything out: sleeping bags, pillows, snacks, the flashlight arsenal. I put on *Tremors*—Blake’s pick—because he claimed it was “educational” for people dealing with underground monsters.

Taylor was already halfway into the Oreos, and Zack was organizing the batteries like we were about to defuse a bomb.

It felt normal. For a little while.

The monster didn’t feel so close.

We laughed too loud. The movie jumped a couple times because our DVD player was scratched, and Blake kept yelling “THIS IS FORESHADOWING” every time Kevin Bacon did anything brave.

But under it all, we were waiting.  
Waiting for the house to go quiet.

Waiting for the lights to go out.  
For my parents to retreat upstairs.

At around 10:40PM, they finally did.

We heard Mom’s voice say, “Please don’t stay up all night,” and then Dad’s muttered “They better not wreck the furniture.”

Footsteps on the stairs.

The creak of the bedroom door.

Silence.

Taylor muted the movie.

We all looked at each other.

Zack was the first to speak. “So… we doing this?”

Taylor nodded. “I say we check the attic. All of us. Flashlights, snacks, slingshot—”

“I forgot the salt,” Blake said.

“No one asked for salt,” she hissed.

“I’m just saying, if it *is* a ghost, we’re unprotected.”

“It’s not a ghost,” I whispered. “It’s something else. Something that breathes and moves and *hurts* things.”

Everyone went quiet.

“I want to know what it is,” I said. “I need to know.”

Zack sat forward. “Then we make a plan. In and out. If anything feels off, we *leave*. No hero stuff.”

Blake nodded, clutching his flashlight like a sword.

Taylor grinned and cracked her knuckles. “Monster-hunting club begins tonight.”

We turned off the movie.

And started getting ready.

We stood in the hallway beneath the attic hatch, flashlights in hand, all four of us staring up at the square in the ceiling like it might blink.

The pull string was gone.

Blake tapped the ceiling with a plastic Wiffle bat he’d brought for “backup,” as if the attic might just open for effort. It didn’t.

“So…” he whispered, “do we have a plan? Or are we just standing here until the attic gets bored and eats us?”

“I’ve got it,” Taylor said, stepping back and dragging over a folding step stool she’d pulled from the laundry room. She thudded it into place beneath the hatch, climbed up two steps, and squinted at the latch. “It’s a little out of reach. I need something to pop it open.”

Blake held out a ruler with duct tape wrapped around the tip. “Custom made.”

Taylor blinked. “Why do you *have* that?”

“For science.”

Zack just shook his head and held up the metal rod from a broken curtain they found in the garage. “Try this instead.”

Taylor smirked. “Much better.”

She stretched on the top step, flashlight clamped under her arm, and jabbed the rod upward. It took a few tries, but finally—click.

The latch gave.

The attic door didn’t fall open fast—it creaked down slow, groaning the way old wood does in scary movies, until the opening yawned above us.

We all stared at the darkness inside.

“I am regretting this,” Blake whispered.

“You regret everything,” Zack said.

“I regret *being friends with you,*” Blake shot back.

I stepped forward with my cast cradled close. “I’ll hold the ladder steady. When you all get up there you can pull me up.”

“I got it,” Taylor said. “I’ll go first.”

Just as she grabbed the top rung of the attic ladder—

“What the hell are you doing?”

We all jumped.

Blake actually gasped. Zack swore under his breath.

Tori stood at the end of the hallway, holding a half-eaten Pop-Tart in one hand and looking like she’d caught us trying to summon the devil.

“Seriously?” she said, eyeing the gear. “This is your plan?”

“I told you to stay in your room,” I muttered.

Tori ignored me. “You’re going up there now? With a broken arm, a ruler, and *Blake*?”

“I brought a foam sword too,” Blake added helpfully.

“I rest my case.”

Taylor gave her a slow blink. “You coming over here just to roast us or…?”

Tori stared up at the attic, her face hard to read.

Then, without another word, she walked over, took the flashlight from Zack’s hand, and stepped beside the ladder.

She didn’t look at me. Just stared into the black square above.

“Mollie was my dog too.”

The hallway went quiet.

Blake blinked at her like she’d just confessed a crush. Taylor actually looked impressed. And Zack—Zack didn’t say a word. He just adjusted the flashlight beam.

Tori stepped up beside Taylor.

“We going,” she said, “or are we gonna stand here all night waiting to pee our pants?”

The attic creaked as we climbed in one by one.

Taylor went first, her flashlight cutting a shaky beam across the dust-heavy air. Blake followed, muttering “nope, nope, nope” under his breath the entire time. Zack climbed behind him, trying to pretend he wasn’t breathing fast. I was last, hoisting myself up one-handed while Tori reached down and helped steady me with surprising care.

The air was warmer than it should’ve been—thick, almost humid. It smelled like insulation and mildew and something *sweet* underneath, like rotting fruit or meat left out too long.

“Ugh, it smells like someone microwaved a diaper,” Blake whispered, holding his shirt over his nose.

“No one light a match,” Zack said. “The air up here might be flammable.”

We all stood together under the low, angled ceiling. The old Christmas boxes were still stacked near the wall. The fan blades Dad took down three summers ago were still leaning in the corner.

But the nest—

The thing I saw two nights ago, made of insulation and shredded blankets and god-knows-what else—

Was gone.

“Wait,” I said, spinning slowly in a circle. “Wait, no. No, it was *right here.*”

I stepped toward the far corner, flashlight shaking.

“There was a nest,” I said. “It was—like, something had made it. It was here. It chased me *from right here.*”

Tori walked beside me, scanning the floor with her light. “There’s nothing. You sure it wasn’t another part of the attic?”

“I’m *sure.* I swear it—”

And then—

The attic breathed.

Or maybe it *exhaled.*

A long, low sound, like something massive shifting in the rafters.

My flashlight flickered.

I turned fast. “Did you hear that?”

“Hear what?” Zack whispered.

“I don’t know but maybe we need to leave,” Blake said. “Right now. No notes, no souvenirs—just vibes and trauma, let’s *go—*”

It moved.

A shape. A blur. Something behind the beams. It darted, fast and low, and *no one else reacted.*

Only me.

“*It’s here—*” I yelled.

No one answered.

“*GUYS, IT’S HERE—*”

The light flared, and then—

It lunged.

I didn’t see its face.

Just claws.

Long, black claws raked across the floor as it tore forward. The shadows swallowed it and spat it back out like smoke. I saw it leap—too fast, too tall—and I shoved Zack sideways as it crashed through where he’d been standing.

“WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!” he yelled.

I didn’t answer.

“WE HAVE TO GO!” I screamed.

I ran.

Back toward the hatch.

Back toward the edge of the attic.

But the ladder wasn’t there anymore. Someone had pulled it up behind us.

And that’s when the thing roared—low and wrong and wet.

It charged.

I turned to the only other way out: the window.

A tiny square, just big enough to fit through.

“Tori!” I shouted. “The window!”

I got there first, yanking it open with a grunt. Taylor was already behind me, kicking the crate under it into place.

We climbed out one by one, onto the slanted roof just above the back porch.

The night air hit me like a punch. Cold. Wet. The stars overhead blurred by my tears and panic.

Blake slipped on the shingles and screamed. Taylor grabbed him.

Zack looked at me wildly, “what are you doing!? Stop!”

Tori was last.

But as she turned to climb through—

The thing reached out.

A clawed hand swiped out of the darkness, slashing toward her back. She twisted just in time, swinging the flashlight like a weapon and connecting with a sickening *CRACK.*

“GO!” she shouted.

But it grabbed her ankle.

She kicked. Screamed.

Zack reached for her.

The roof groaned.

She *almost* made it.

And then—

The shingle beneath her foot slipped.

And she fell.

I watched her tumble backward into the darkness below, her scream trailing off as her body disappeared from sight.

Then silence.

Just our breath. The hum of the night. The wind.

And the open window behind us.

Still breathing.

We stood on the roof for what felt like forever.

No one said anything.

The wind moved through the trees below. Porch lights from the neighbors cast long shadows on the lawn. And somewhere out there—Tori.

She wasn’t screaming anymore.

“Come on,” I said, scrambling toward the edge. “We have to find her—”

Zack grabbed my good arm. “Careful.”

Blake looked like he might throw up. His flashlight was shaking so bad the beam was bouncing off the trees.

Taylor was already climbing down the drainpipe mumbling as she went, “why did you do that?!” 

We followed.

By the time we reached the ground, we found her crumpled near the base of the hedges—face scratched, one shoe missing, her left leg bent wrong.

She was breathing.

Barely.

Her eyes fluttered open for a second. She saw me.

Then closed them again...

The ambulance came fast.

Too fast.

Blue lights lit up our front yard while neighbors peeked through their blinds. My parents ran outside barefoot. My mom screamed when she saw Tori on the stretcher.

The paramedics asked questions. Zack answered most of them. Taylor barely spoke. Blake cried once, then pretended he wasn’t.

No one asked me anything.

No one looked at me.

Later, inside, the four of us sat in the living room, scattered across the floor like broken puzzle pieces.

The popcorn bowl had spilled during the panic. One of the sleeping bags was still half-zipped. The *Tremors* DVD menu looped quietly on the TV screen.

I hugged my knees, cast pressed to my chest, and stared at the carpet.

“I saw it,” I whispered. “It *grabbed her.* It pulled her back.”

No one said anything.

Taylor sat with her back to the couch, arms crossed, face hard. Her ponytail was messed up, and her sleeve had blood on it.

Zack didn’t even look at me.

“She wouldn’t have gone up there,” he said flatly, “if it weren’t for you.”

That hit harder than I thought it would.

“I didn’t make her go,” I said. “She *wanted* to. She said—”

“Yeah,” Taylor cut in, “she said ‘Mollie was my dog too.’ Because she felt *bad* for you.”

Blake sniffled from the recliner. “You said we’d just look. You said it wasn’t going to *do* anything.”

“I didn’t *know* it would attack,” I snapped. “I didn’t know it would—”

“It’s all in your head, man,” Zack said. “There was nothing there.”

“There *was!*” I shouted, louder than I meant to. “I saw it. It chased us. It grabbed her ankle.”

Silence.

Taylor finally looked at me.

But not like she believed me.

Like she was looking at someone she *used* to know.

“You’re the only one who ever sees it,” she said. “That’s kinda weird, don’t you think?”

I didn’t have an answer.

Taylor looked down to the floor, “nothing grabbed her…we all saw what happened…you pushed her.”

I looked down at the carpet, suddenly aware of how loud my breathing was.

Outside, the ambulance was gone.

So was Tori.

The front door creaked open.

Mom stepped in first, her face pale like a ghost. Behind her came Dad, still in his pajamas, hair windblown, eyes heavy with something worse than anger.

The kind of look you give someone when you don’t recognize them anymore.

“Get your stuff,” Mom said to the others.

No one said a word.

Taylor. Zack. Blake. They just moved. Silent. Tired. Like kids leaving a funeral.

I didn’t expect a goodbye, but it still hurt when I didn’t get one.

Mom ushered them out without looking back. Then the door closed.

Just me and Dad now.

The house groaned softly in the quiet. The movie menu still looped on the TV—“Play,” “Scene Select,” “Special Features.” The last time anything felt normal.

Dad walked over to the couch and sat down slowly. He looked like he’d aged ten years in one night.

I didn’t move from the floor.

He rubbed his face with both hands, then looked at me.

“I just got off the phone with the hospital,” he said, voice raw. “Tori’s stable. Banged up bad. But she’s gonna be okay.”

I let out a breath I didn’t know I’d been holding.

He nodded to himself. Then leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees.

There was a long silence.

Then he said, “Your friends… they told us what happened.”

I looked away.

“They said it was your idea. That you made them go up there. That you were the only one who saw anything.”

I said nothing.

“But I believe you think it’s real,” he added, softly. “I do.”

My throat burned.

“It *is* real,” I whispered.

He didn’t answer.

Instead, he let out a shaky breath and said, “There’s something I haven’t told you.”

That made me look up.

He wasn’t meeting my eyes. Just staring at the floor.

“The night Mollie died…” he started, voice slow, like the words were too heavy to push out. “I told your mom I found her in the attic. I told you she must’ve gotten into poison.”

I nodded. “You said she was already gone.”

“She was. But it wasn’t poison.”

He finally looked at me.

“When I found you up there… there wasn’t any rat bait. No spilled box. No teeth marks.”

He swallowed hard.

“There was just a hammer. Covered in blood. And your hands—your shirt—*you* were covered too.”

I froze.

A strange ringing filled my ears.

“I thought… maybe she’d already been hurt. Maybe you’d found her like that and tried to help. Maybe you grabbed the hammer because you were scared. I *wanted* to believe that. You had tried to soak up her blood with your blanket but…”

“Dad…”

“But now—after Tori, after the attic, after tonight…” He trailed off.

I stared at him, my pulse thudding like thunder in my ears.

“I think we need to go back,” he said quietly. “Back to the neurologist. Back to Dr. Kim.”

I shook my head.

“You remember what she said when you were five,” he continued. “After the surgery. About the scar tissue? That if anything changed, if the headaches came back, if you started… seeing things—”

“I’m *not* seeing things,” I snapped.

He didn’t argue.

He just said, “I don’t think this is your fault. But I think something’s wrong. Something we can’t see.”

I stood up, fists clenched.

“You think I hurt Mollie?”

“I think something hurt you,” he said. “And I don’t know how to fix it.”

My chest felt tight.

My cast itched like fire.

“You didn’t see it,” I whispered. “You never see it.”

He stood, slower than me. Careful.

“I see *you.* And that’s enough to scare the hell out of me.”

 

Mom stayed at the hospital with Tori.

Dad made a bed on the couch, but I knew he wasn’t sleeping. I could hear him tossing. Getting up. Sitting back down. Every hour or so, he’d check on me through the crack in my bedroom door.

He didn’t trust me anymore.

And maybe he was right.

But I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

The creature. The attic. The way no one else had seen it. The hammer. The blood. The *thing* inside the wall breathing.

If it was in my head… then why did everything feel so real?

Around 3AM, I couldn’t take it anymore.

I grabbed my plastic lightsaber, flicked the red blade to life, and crouched beside the wall in my room where I first heard the noise. 

The plaster felt cold under my fingers. Hollow.

I grabbed the old metal bat from under my bed.

And I started swinging.

CRACK.  
CRACK.

Drywall split apart. Chunks of insulation spilled onto the floor like guts. Dust filled the air like ash.

Behind it—wooden beams. And a gap.

Big enough to crawl through.

Inside the walls, it was tighter than I expected.

Spiderwebs clung to my face. The wood groaned around me. But I knew the house—*my house*. And I knew that if I went up just a little further, past the bathroom vent, past the pipes, past the beams…

I could get to the attic.

It was a short crawl.

But it felt like a mile.

The attic opened like a mouth.

The lightsaber buzzed softly, casting everything in a red haze.

And then I saw it.

The creature.

It stood taller than a man. Skin stretched too tight. Limbs long and crooked. Its mouth hung open—not for a scream, not a growl, just a sound like breathing from the bottom of a well.

Its eyes locked on me.

It charged. I pulled back a marble in the slingshot and let it fly and it bounced off its skull.

I swung the lightsaber. Plastic cracked across its arm.

It didn’t flinch.

It lunged— snarling and snapping its teeth at me I tossed my arm forward

And it bit down on my cast.

I screamed. Felt the pressure. The pain.

I slammed the saber against its skull over and over, backing toward the old boxes in the corner.

One toppled.

A can of paint thinner splattered onto the floor. The creature lifted me with one hand and chucked me against the far wall my arm getting tangled in wires in the corner. The weight of my body jerking them from their place and causing sparks to fly out into the air of the attic.

The flame caught the insulation like a match to dry leaves. The mix of the paint thinner and the sparks made it go up quick.

Whoosh.

Fire spread fast.

Too fast.

The attic filled with smoke.

Flames danced across the beams, chewing up memories. Christmas boxes. Old furniture. Toys.

The creature screamed.

A real one this time.

Animal and furious.

I scrambled for the window, climbing up onto the roof.

Smoke poured from the attic window behind me, thick and black, curling into the sky like a signal flare. The heat licked at my back as I scrambled onto the pitched roof, my cast thudding against the shingles.

The monster came through the fire.

It burst out of the window like a living shadow, its skin scorched and blistered, its claws dragging sparks across the wood. Parts of it still smoked. One shoulder was blackened. The side of its face looked like melted wax—but it didn’t stop.

It moved like it couldn’t feel pain.

Like it had never been alive in the first place.

I turned and ran, slipping across the slanted rooftop, nails tearing at the shingles as I tried to crawl higher. The slope dipped fast near the edge, right above the driveway. One wrong step and I’d fall.

The creature lunged again.

I spun, swinging the broken lightsaber hilt like a club. It caught the monster’s jaw with a *crack*, sending it staggering, but only for a second. It came back harder—claws slashing.

One caught my side.

The fabric of my shirt ripped. I felt heat and pain, and then blood.

I screamed.

“GET AWAY FROM ME!”

I shoved it. Hard. With everything I had.

We both slid.

Shingles ripped free beneath our weight. The roof groaned under us. A beam snapped with a deep *POP* from below.

I tried to dig my fingers into the edge. My cast scraped uselessly along the surface.

The creature grabbed my leg.

I kicked wildly, boots slamming into its burned face. Its grip loosened for just a second—

And that’s when the roof gave way.

There was a deep, horrible *cracking* sound, and suddenly everything tilted.

The whole corner of the roof collapsed in flames.

We fell together, tangled—me and the thing that wasn’t supposed to exist.

The air ripped past me.  
Heat roared up to meet us.  
Then—

Blackness…

 

The lights were soft. The air sterile. Machines beeped in slow, steady rhythms.

I opened my eyes.

White sheets.

An IV in my arm.

My wrist in a new cast.

And Dad, sitting beside me, his arm bandaged in thick, burnt gauze.

“You’re awake,” he said quietly.

My throat was dry. “Tori?”

“She’s okay. Your mom’s still with her.”

I nodded.

“House is gone nearly” he said. “Burned up the attic and your room, the Fire chief says it started in the attic. Electrical wiring. That’s what they think.”

I looked away.

“I pulled you out from under what was left of your room,” he continued. “the doctor’s said it was a miracle.” 

I didn’t answer. I looked at his arm that was bandaged, he must have been burnt in the fire trying to save me.

 A knock came at the door.

Dr. Kim stepped in, holding a folder.

She smiled softly at me. “Good to see you, sweetheart. We ran a scan while you were under.”

She handed the folder to Dad.

He opened it.

Stared for a long time.

Then he turned it toward me.

An MRI.

Black and white. Fuzzy.

But clear enough.

Something round, pressing into part of my brain.

Like a shadow blooming behind my eyes.

Dad’s voice cracked.

“There’s your monster…”

The files dance under the fan on my desk. I shut them close. I was going to look at them again, but I needed some prep time. My hands trembled ever so slightly as I took a tentative sip of my now, cold coffee.

My superiors had temporarily declassified files related to the June 19th Berlin incident. I guess the idea was to prepare me for what was to come and I needed all the info I could get my hands on. I set the documents on my desk when my phone rang, breaking the sombre silence in my small office.

“Yeah ma? No nothing dangerous, just government stuff”

I take another look at the case files.

“Keep takin’ those medicines on time okay? I don’t wanna hear no complainin’. No ma I already told you I’m not callin’ him. Alright see ya.”

One call every Sunday. That’s all I was allowed. “Just government stuff”

Yeah right.

I set my coffee down and prepare myself to go over all the documents again. Instruction manual first, I guess.

At least this job paid a fortune. 6 months and I’m out, I remind myself. 6 months… the length of that time period was finally beginning to set in. With a nervous sigh, I open the case files again.

The headline from the local newspaper was attached to the corner. “28 junkies dead in local brothel”. Then I looked at the crime scene photos again. 28 bodies in various states of decay. They looked like skeletons with skin like paper stretched thin over them. Arms so skinny you could probably hold five of them in one palm. You’d think it was the drugs that killed ‘em if not for one thing. Their faces. I didn’t want to look at the closeups again. Their wide eyes, their open mouths staring at something that was just there, it was too much. How they managed to capture whatever caused this was beyond me. 

I set the files aside. *I need to focus on the task at hand*. Starting today, 6 months, 180 odd days. Doable? Maybe.

I grab my coffee and jolt mid-sip as the buzzer rings. 

“BZZZZZZT”

Here goes nothing. I swipe my access card at the lift. 27 is already lit. I tuck my shirt, straighten my badge. 

*DING*

First stop: the pantry. My footsteps echo too loud or maybe the floor was too quiet. *Was it supposed to be this quiet?* I hear the squeaking of my shoes on the floor get louder. 

“Breathe.” I remind myself, I feel my pace slow down, just barely. I swipe my access card at the pantry. 

“Uh… 2709” I mutter to the server. 

He wordlessly hands me a tray with plain rice and no garnish on it. We briefly make eye contact. *Is that pity? I’m definitely projecting.* 2709 is just ahead, squeaks getting louder again. I don’t care, I want to get this over with. 

I take a deep breath and find myself in front of a large metal door. There’s a card reader to the left of it. I swipe my access card. I hear it groan as it swings inward. 

The harsh white tube lights buzz as I step inside. The keys jingle in my pocket. The door closes behind me. It’s a plain white room with... *Huh?* I see a woman tied to a chair. *Don’t look.* I quickly direct my gaze downward. ‘The entity’ huh. The chains around the woman are thick and press into her skin. She shifts uncomfortably. *Is this the right room?* I glance back.

2709. 

She’s looking directly at me, I can feel it. 

“What are you waiting for?”, her head tilts to one side, a playful smile on her lips. *Doesn;t sound German to me.*

“Hey I’m hungry come on” 

“S-sorry”. 

*Shit.*

*You spoke.* 

*You fucking spoke.* 

I walk towards the metal table in front of her and quietly place her food there. There’s a spoon on the rice, not that she can use it, her wrists are tied behind her back, her legs are tied together. 

“You checkin me out sweetheart?”, she purrs. I shift my gaze to the floor. 

*Don’t engage.*

*Don’t engage.*

Just wait until someone else comes in, back to the wall. I feel a drop of sweat on my temple.

“They’re feedin’ me like the fucking dogs over here”, she chuckles, her laughter is so sweet. “Real gourmet stuff, Thank you Chef”, she shouts into the air. She sounds like…. someone I know. *No. Impossible.* I keep my eyes locked on to the floor, I’m not even here. I’m on a beach in Hawaii.

“They give you the same stuff too, new guy?”. She bends over and eats directly from the plate. 

I got two coconuts in my hands, shades on my face, life's good.

“Mmm fuckin’ five stars”, she says sarcastically. I feel bad for her. Am I breaking protocol by feeling bad? I remind myself of the crime scene photos again. 

*Their corpses.*

*Their skin.*

*Their eyes.*

*Focus.*

“Hey, newbie” I see her mouth curve into a smile again. 

“Come on I won’t bite”, I hear her chains clatter violently as she moves her limbs in demonstration. I flinch. “See? I’m in fuckin’ chains. You scared of a girl in chains?”

Sunsets, beaches, tropical babes. *This is the high life baby.*

“Bet you’re real straight huh? Never locked up like this, alone. No windows, no clocks, only sound’s the stupid fucking buzzin’ lights that never turn off? How do you think that feels?”, she pauses. I swear I know that voice, no, the tone.

I close my eyes and try to feel the warm sea breeze on my face. 

“Feels like it’s in your skull, that’s what it feels like”, she says softly. Must feel like shit.

The door opens. I breathe out. 4 men in hazmat suits walk in. *Why don’t I get a fucking hazmat suit?*

“Aww man, well see ya soon newbie”, she giggles. I’ve heard it, I swear. A long long time ago. On a playground. A memory I can’t place.

I fill out the report form. Section 5: Verbal Contact. I tick ‘No’. *I didn’t speak*. 

I close the door behind me. I feel the sweat pool all over my uniform as my legs turn to jelly. Swipe, swipe, swipe. I’m home. My legs give out. 

I collapse onto my chair, my breathing unsteady. I take a moment to calm myself. *Come on man you did it, just do it 179 more times and you’re set.* I laugh as I take off my uniform and step into the shower. The water seems to take all the stress away. My mind’s still in that room. “Get used to it champ”, I mutter as I clean myself. “It’s an easy job, easy money, real easy. Just don’t be stupid and you’re eatin’ good.” I dry my hair off and step outside. I change into a fresh set. *How’s ma doing?* 7 days till I find out she’s okay. Or not. No way to know. I make my way down the hall, the facility’s post office sits tucked away past the debrief rooms.

“21, how you doin’? How can I help ya?”, Jimmy asks with a smile. *Seems like the only guy with a personality in here.*

“Can you double check that address real quick? I’ll be outta your hair lickity split”

“It’s the 4th time, do I look that stupid?”, he chuckles. “Here check it yourself man.”

“Just makin’ sure”, I run my hands on the records until I find my ID. 

“Dependents, Address line 1, Line 2, Postal code”, I mutter. “Okay, checks out, I won’t ask again Jim.”

“What, you got a lady back home?”, he asks playfully.

“Just my ma.” I pause. “And uh… dependent 2 get approved yet?”

Jimmy’s smile fades a little, “You know how it is man. He's got a history you know, they're uh, they’re looking into it.” He straightens the stack of papers on his desk. “It’ll happen man, I'm tryin’ my best you know—”

“I know, I know and that means a lot, just keep me posted. Thanks again man” I leave quickly. 

“Don’t mention it”, I hear behind me. 

I eat my dinner quietly. Not a hint of spice. Cheap bastards. I put on a sitcom on the TV as I finish my bowl. The food, however bland, fills my stomach. The day’s events begin weighing on me as I slump deeper and deeper into my chair and before I know it, sleep lulls me into its warm embrace. 

\---------------

“BZZZZZZT”

I snap awake and stumble into a fresh uniform. Swipe, swipe, swipe and I’m standing in front of the metal door again. I let my breathing even out and repeat my mantra: *I’m not fucking up.* The sound of the large door opening fills the halls.

“Missed me sweetheart?”, *You’re a professional god damn it*. I wait for the door to close behind me. I feign nonchalance as I walk to the centre of the room. I set the tray on the table.

“Two weeks huh newbie? That's record time!”, she leans towards me, the large chains digging deeper and deeper into her flesh. The thought of those restraints sends a chill down my spine. “The other guy couldn’t last a day” I feel her eyes burning into me. *Are they glowing?* She laughs. “I’m joking newbie, where’s your sense of humour huh?” 

*Fucking hilarious.* I force my mind to wander into the mountains.

“You really believe them, don’t you?” she lowers her voice to a whisper. “Bet they showed you all those scary pictures.”, she giggles. “You really think I did that?”. 

*Could she have? Doesn’t matter, the sun’s coming up. I feel the cold air wash over my body.*

“The ol’ freakshow slideshow, real convincing. Don’t blink too hard baby you be their good little boy”, she laughs some more.

*The summits an hour away, final stretch come on. What was that documentary guy's dog called? Snow. Right. Snow’s here. Wagging his tail like always.*

I feel her giggles slide under my skin.

*Keep climbing. Cold wind. Distant screams.*

She sighs, “It’s okay newbie. Everyone needs me to be their boogieman. I don’t care about that. But you newbie, you’re always looking so serious.” She shifts in her chains. “Got a girl back home keepin you in check?”

*The breeze is getting colder, snow is barking incessantly.* 

“Siblings? Parents? Bet they're so proud of you huh newbie?”

*Snow’s still barking, Or laughing. She's laughing. It echoes in the mountains.*

“So how's your ma doin’?”

I snap out of it. 

I don't flinch. I keep my face straight. A single drop of sweat on my temple drops the facade.

“Is she doin’ okay newbie? Is she gettin’ calls from her big responsible boy?”, she laughs. *Mountains mountains mountains.*

“Bet she’s feelin’ lonely. Say newbie, did you tell her where you’re workin’? You’re not tellin’ me you lied to sweet ol’ mama did you?”, she makes an exaggerated pout. Her tone, her accent. Something about the lilt at the end of her words—

Daisy Peters. 

My first crush in middle school. Doodled her name all over my notebook. She used to laugh when I stuttered. I was always so shy. It never felt mean. It felt like a million butterflies.

*What the fuck is taking so long?* 

“You a liar, newbie? Been lyin’ to your ma? I mean they call me a monster but even for me that's fucked up.”, she cackles. *Time’s up, come on, what the hell is the hold up?*  “They ain’t comin’ for you this time”, she manages between her laughs.

The metal door opens. It’s loud and slow, but the sound is a welcome reprieve. The sense of relief fades away as I check the time. *10 minutes longer with this thing for what?* My breath feels hot as I fill the form. I wait outside the door. I see the 4 men step out. “Why’d it take so long for you guys to get me today?”, I try to sound polite. It sounds bitter. I ask again, louder. Their footsteps retreat from me, faces unreadable under their masks. *Chumps*. 

I storm to the post office. A lady greets me at the door. Her smile is warm, and fake.

“Hi sir, how can I help you?” 

“Where’s Jim, I wanna know the status of my second dependent”

“He isn’t in today, would you like me to make an inquiry on your behalf?”. Lies. She doesn’t drop her smile.

“Are you sure about that? I saw him today, I can just ask him myself” I ask, my voice barely above a whisper.

“It must’ve been someone else sir” she replies, her smile still unwavering, almost mocking. 

I stare at her, trying to read her expression. “I’ll just stand here till he’s back then. I got time.” I cross my arms. I know I saw him in the morning.

“He won’t be in for a while sir. Anything else I can help you with besides the inquiry?”

The adrenaline wears off, I see two guards approaching me from a distance. “No uh, never mind.” I mutter. The guards resume their positions.

I stand in one spot in my room. I'm trying to ease my breath. *Calm down*. It's getting even faster. I feel my heart pounding against its cage. Another envelope. 

**Psychological Evaluation Form Tier 2** 

*I already filled this last week and now this shit again? For what? For asking why those idiots couldn't do their job?*

I fill out the form, muttering under my breath. The sudden instinct to tear the stupid piece of paper overwhelms me. *It’s so flimsy and weak I could just— Get a fucking hold of yourself.* *One sam is enough for the family*. I put the form back in the envelope. My breathing eases. My mind is still a whirlwind of emotions. I fiddle with my shirt buttons and then take it off. I slip into pajamas.

As my anger subsides, tiredness settles in. I feel my heart still pounding. *So tired and it’s only 1pm*. *Should’ve gotten that gym membership for myself instead.* I close my eyes. *When would I even go? Between Ma’s appointments and work. If I just had some help… If he’d just try.* I feel myself drift into something older, something familiar.

The wallpaper is peeling off. The hall stinks of old socks and incense. I’m in front of a door. I knock twice.

“Come on don’t be like that, open up”, Ma’s standing next to me, arms crossed. She turns her neck towards the door and then back to me. 

I sigh, “Ma’s takin’ your side this time, you satisfied?”. I turn to Ma, her eyebrows are furrowed, she mouths, “Do better”

“I mean, I’m sorry.” I pause. “I’m never callin’ you a junkie again okay I promise”, I turn the handle, of course it’s locked. “I messed up man I just wish you’d fucking try sometimes. I’ll help you out, I’ll drive you to those meetings every single day of my life if I have to, I swear”, my heart’s beating fast, Ma’s face shifts from anger to concern. “Come on man don’t shut me out” my hands are trembling, I feel like I’m going to break the handle. Ma’s eyes widen, they're glowing. She's banging on the door. 

“Sam? Sam! Baby he didn’t mean it come on”

My throat tightens, I’ve broken the handle. Ma is still banging on the door. No. Wait. She’s giggling. I’m punching the door. I smell metal.

I don’t hear myself scream, just the itch in my throat.

The walls collapse. I’m enveloped in black. 

Then a blinding light. No it's tubelights, wooden desks. Mr. Rogers at the chalk board. 

I'm so cold. *Why am I so cold?* I try to move but Daisy’s next to me, twirling her hair like always. She turns to me and smiles.

“Hey newbie”

I jolt up. My t-shirt’s damp.

I place my palms on my face and wipe the sweat off.

“Stupid junkie.”

That’s what I called him back then. That’s what I was thinking even now.

I rub my eyes.

*Just a dream*. The details are getting fuzzier by the second. *It’s over*.

I see a flip phone placed on my desk, I didn’t even remember it was Sunday already. 

I grab it and I dial the only number I ever bothered to remember. My fingers won’t stop shaking. Just a dream.

I hear her voice come through.

“Hello?”

“Hey ma”, I try to keep my voice from shaking. I want to tell her everything. 

“How’s my baby holdin’ up, you had your lunch yet?”

“Just got back to my office ma, I-I’m starvin’.” they’re probably listening. 

“They feedin’ you good? They aint workin’ you too hard?”

“Yeah ma it’s like a fuckin’ buffet over here, got meals from all sorts of places”, I force a laugh. 

I hesitate. The words come before I can help it. “How’s-how’s Sam ma how's he doin’?”

She pauses,“He’s doin’ alright honey. Folks at rehab told me he's making real strides. They’re—”, I hear her choke up. She tries to hide it. “They’re saying he's finally gonna beat it this time. I–I uh”

“It’s okay ma, I’m just happy you guys are doing okay”

I sniffle away from the phone’s mic.

“Get him on the phone next time, and uh, tell him I miss him.”, I mute the phone as I feel more tears roll down my face. I let them come. “And you tell him I’m real proud”. 

There's silence between us. It’s not like the silence in the office. 

“I’ll make sure to tell him that baby. I love you. You're doin great honey. Don’t let these government idiots get you down okay?”

“Alright I got these files I gotta review right”, I wipe my eyes with the heels of my hands, “I’ll be going now. I love you too.” 

I hang up and lay on my bed. *No way but through champ.* I grab my apartment keys and head to the post office.

“I want my guitar from my apartment.” I drop off the flip phone and my keys.

“Alrighty sir, do you understand this reduces your allocated couriers to uh… 2?” 

“Yes I do, make it quick please”, I flash her a smile as I head back. No way I’m going to sit here and just rot. *I got shit to lose, I’m going all the way to the finish line.* I finish my dinner and set an alarm.

\---------------

“BZZZZZZT” 

I’m already up. I’ve been setting alarms to wake up way before the buzzer gets a chance to get me. My uniform hangs loose on my shoulders, I adjust it. 

I glance at my calendar on the way out. Sunday morning. Not that it matters. I haven’t spoken to ma in weeks.

I straighten my badge and head to the pantry. On the way I glance at my fingertips. My calluses are fading. I smile.

*You don't wanna talk to me random server guy? I don’t care.* I take the tray and step in front of the metal door. It looks much smaller now. I almost laugh as I swipe my access card. It beeps and turns green. I'm in. 

“Morning” 

“Morning newbie” she smiles, it’s warm and sweet.

“You hungry?”, I smile back, only time I feel like it these days.

“Starvin’” I set the tray down. “Thanks newbie. Did they approve Sam's dependent status yet?”

“Been chasing them for weeks at this point.” I take my usual spot on the wall. “I mean it’s my money, why do they care where the hell it goes? Bunch of morons in suits” 

She giggles “Oh come on newbie you think they’re checkin’ his background? You think they care? They couldn’t give a fuck about you.” She bends down and eats from her plate. 

“You sure they ain’t got wire taps in here?”, my eyes dart around the room.

“I saw them hook this whole place up” she manages between bites. “Just cameras. Keep your head down though I don’t want you gettin’ in trouble.”

“Mhmm” I keep my eyes down.

“It’s almost time newbie, I’ll see you tomorrow then” 

I hear the door whoosh open. *Must’ve oiled it.*

I tick ‘No’ again.

For verbal contact.

I always tick no.

Right?

I stroll to the post office, I see Jimmy at his desk. He looks up at me. He squints, then smiles.

“Hey man, how-how you doin’?”

I feel stares on me from the other workers. *Mind your fucking business.*

“Guess I’m alright. Did you catch any news on the whole dependent 2 thing Jim?”

Jimmy hesitates, “I-uh… Look man, they denied it. It isn’t official yet but upstairs says they can’t be sending money to anyone with a record.”

I felt my breath getting quicker.

“It’s my fucking brother Jim. He needs the money. It’s been months, why the fuck didn’t I hear anything?”

More heads turning. 

“Don’t kill the messenger alright?”, Jimmy shifts in his seat. “I’m just telling you what I heard. They didn’t send me a letter. You know I’d tell you if they did.”

I close my eyes for a second and exhale slow. I feel my hands balling into a fist, the skin on my knuckles feels tight.

“Fine. But I’m reapplying, I’ll get a letter from his rehab.”

“You’ll need to fill this out first.” Jimmy reaches under his desk and hands me an envelope.

 

**Psychological Evaluation Tier 3**

“Jim I just filled this out last—”

“Just do it”, he says, quieter. “It’s different”

He’s holding out the envelope, not breaking eye contact. 

I take it.

I almost sprint to my room. I tear the envelope open on my desk. It’s a dossier. “Guard 21”. I flip it open. 

**Psychological Report** 

*“…Guard 21 continues to exhibit increased emotional volatility. Expressed unprovoked hostility during delivery round. Noted sweating, verbal disorientation, gaze avoidance. Denied contact with entity (verbal), but behavioral indicators might suggest otherwise…”*

I flip the pages.

**Behavioural metrics table**

*…*

*• Day 03 – flinched upon hearing entity speak; observed lip movement. No audio logged.*

*• Day 08 – Time spent in Room 2709 exceeds SOP window by 2m 41s.*

*• Day 12 – Elevated heart rate (recorded 132 bpm) upon exit. Possible distress response.*

*• Day 14 – returned tray with trembling hands, failed to complete Section 5 of report form.*

*• Day 16 – Observed laughing during debrief transit. No external stimulus recorded.*

…

*Subject appears to be talking in his sleep.*

*Keeps saying “Snow, down boy.”*

*…*

The next page is an empty white sheet with a grainy, photocopied image still stapled to a plain white sheet. Timecode’s in the corner

***Image Description:*** *Subject 21 standing within 3 feet of the entity. Hands behind back. Expression neutral or faintly amused.*

Caption written in pen beneath the image: *“You’re not supposed to be smiling.”*

*…*

A weight sinks in my stomach. I was smiling. I don’t remember smiling.

I look up at the ceiling. Then again. And again.

*Shit. SHIT.*

I climb on my desk, running my hands through the ceiling. *Where are the FUCKING cameras?* I sprint to my bed, throw the mattress to the floor and bend down. *Under the pillows, under the mattress. In the bathroom? Fuck uh on my desk.* I feel my chest heave as I tear my room apart. GOD DAMN IT

“BZZZZZZT” 

Already? I feel the sun peaking through the blinds. Did I sleep?

I slip on my uniform. I need a belt. I check my reflection in the bathroom mirror. I barely recognize myself. I need to speak to Jim. I dial the intercom. 

No answer.

I slam the phone in place. 

I hurry over to the post office, it’s shuttered\*.\*

*“GUARD 21 PLEASE REPORT TO PANTRY FOR DUTY”,* the PA system screams

Shit. I sprint to the lift. The elevator music is glitching. It’s grating.

*DING*

I take the tray. It’s empty. The server shutters the pantry window close. *What the hell is his problem?*

*Calm down.* 

*No, I don't wanna calm down.* 

Stupid bureaucracy, stupid company, stupid fucking job. Won’t even let me talk to my ma. I swipe my access card. Drop the tray. I’m too mad to think.

“They’re trying to break you down, newbie. I can’t just sit here and watch.”

I’m trying to calm myself. I look at the camera on the wall, then back down. “I haven’t spoken to ma in weeks, they’re fucking calling it a tower outage.”

“BULLSHIT. You hear me newbie? It’s bullshit. They just want you cornered and alone. So you listen to them like a good little pooch. But you see through it, newbie. I know you do.” 

I look away, pretend to scratch my cheek.

“Come on you gotta stay strong, for your Ma. I can live without rice for a day, don’t you cry for me neither.”

“I fucking hate it here”

“Me too newbie. You think they keep rapists like this? Killers? No. But if a girl defends herself, lock her up, throw away the fucking key.” she rattles her chains.

“Did you really do it 201? I don’t care I just gotta know” 

“What if I told you I did?”

Silence.

“Every last one of ’em deserved it. You hear me newbie? EVERY LAST ONE”, her voice echos. “Every needle-arm, every twitchy little fucker who thought I was weak had it coming.”

“Bunch of lowlife junkies too.” *Maybe the world is better off without these vermin. All a bunch of fucking Sams.* 

“You’re the only one that understands.” Her eyes glow softly, I feel her smiling at me. “You don’t need to call me 201, newbie. The name’s Daisy.”

The lights shut. The room is drowned in a red glow. I hear an announcement being made outside. The AC is out, the door is locked. The power’s out. 

*GENERATOR FAILURE. POWER EXPECTED TO BE OUT BETWEEN 2 TO 4 HOURS*

My eyes widen as the metal door swings open. 

“Newbie please” she chokes. “Take me with you. I promise I know the best place to hide. Just you and me. The cameras are out come on” 

I feel a pull. 

*You’re breaking protocol.*

I feel my head turning.

*“DO NOT look it in the eye”*

*GENERATOR FAILURE. POWER EXPECTED TO BE OUT BETWEEN 2 TO 4 HOURS*

Daisy Peters, my first love. Her smile could brighten up the darkest days. She looked so beautiful, her lips full, her teeth sharp and pointy. Little horns on the top of her head. She was so cute. Beautiful glowing emeralds for eyes. Her tongue is slit, powerful, graceful. 

“So what’s your name, newbie?”

“I-I uh” I pause, “I don’t remember.”

She's beautiful.

“Get me out”, she sings.

I’m transfixed.

“GET ME OUT”, Daisy jumps with joy. 

I get to work. I insert my keys into the lock, they’re not turning. I feel the metal press against my skin.

I’m tugging them. She's screaming. 

I choke. I’m so pathetic.

“GET ME OUT PLEASE”

I’m biting at them. My teeth are bleeding. I don’t care. Daisy’s crying. *Daisy’s crying.* She's sobbing. She's inconsolable. Don’t cry Daisy please. “I’m trying, I swear I’m trying. I’ll convince my superiors, just please”

But then she stops.Just for a second.Her body jerks forward like she’s going to scream again — but nothing comes out.She slumps slightly. The chains rattle.“Please...” she whispers, softer. “Please don’t leave me here.”

The lights come back on. I stand up and plead with the guards to let her go. I beg. I cry. I’m kicking and screaming. But they pick me up with ease.

I see tears pool around Daisy’s eyes again. She breathes in again and manages to scream one last time.

“PLEASE JUST GET ME—” 

The metal door shuts. My heart breaks.

I’m sedated.

I wake up in a haze. I’m tied to a chair. One arm is free. How considerate.

I’m sorry ma. I’m sorry Sam. 

The chains around me press into my bones. 

I’m in a dark room surrounded by monitors.

*There was no power cut. There was no guard.* 

A thousand voices blare from speakers around me. 

I see myself trying to break Daisy out. I see myself trash my room. I’m sleeping. I’m running down the hall. I’m at the post office.

*Please just make it stop.* 

Jimmy walks in and hands me a pen. 

“Fill this out”

I look down. A form.

**Psychological Evaluation – Tier 4**

I flip it over.

**Phase 4: Subject 21 Exposure Analysis**

**Hypothesis: Emotionally compromised subjects exhibit decreased resistance to Subject 201’s identity drift pattern under prolonged exposure.**

I see Daisy crying on the camera again. Tears blot the paper as I tick boxes. 

Through all the voices I hear Daisy’s the loudest:

“GET ME OUT PLEASE”

1l6wvfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1l6wvfo/sick_day_part_1/,"""Sick Day."" - Part 1","I don’t remember much of my childhood but the parts I do remember I wish I could forget. 

I hadn’t thought about that week in years.  
Not until I started cleaning out *His* garage.

This place still smelled like motor oil and sawdust. The old fluorescent light buzzed overhead, flickering every few seconds like it was trying to remind me that time doesn’t move the same in places like this. 

I found a half-finished workbench in the corner, dust settled over it like snow. The same one Dad said he’d finally finish ""when he had the time.""

He never did. 

Even with the windows cracked and the door rolled halfway open, the air clung to me—sawdust, WD-40, old sweat and rusted metal. The kind of smell that sinks into your skin. I stood there for a while just breathing it in, like it might fill the hole in my chest.

He was gone.

Three weeks ago, the cancer finally won.

It wasn’t sudden. We’d known for months—maybe longer, if I’m honest with myself. 

But even when the chemo started thinning his hair and turning his skin that gray-yellow color, Dad never wanted to talk about it.  
“It’s just a bump in the road,” he’d said.  
He meant it.

He still worked in here up until the last two months, dragging himself out of bed with a thermos full of black coffee and a stubborn glint in his eye. I’d tell him to rest. He’d grunt something like, “Nah, I’ve still got a few good licks in me,” and then he’d go tinkering with something that didn’t need fixing just to prove he still could.

I used to sit on that upside-down milk crate and watch him work. We'd listen to the radio, WLIK on low, playing some twangy acoustic stuff that I hated as a kid and miss now like hell.

He didn't say much. Never did. But when I’d hand him a socket wrench without being asked, he’d nod like it meant something. Like maybe he was proud of me in his quiet way.

I think about that more now. All the things he said with gestures. The way he'd pat my back when he passed by. He wasn’t a perfect dad. Not by a long shot. He yelled when he got overwhelmed. Shut down when he didn’t know how to help. Hell, when I came out as gay, he just nodded and flicked the tv channel over to Will and Grace. 

He never really knew what to do with feelings—his or mine.

But he showed up. Every time.

Even when I didn’t deserve it.

And now...  
Now I’m standing in the middle of his garage with my childhood in one hand and nothing but silence in the other.

 I’d come home to clean the place out—after the funeral, after the casseroles, after the endless parade of “I’m so sorry” from people who didn’t know him, not really. 

I knew Mom and Tori couldn’t deal with it. 

I was going through his old toolbox when I found it: my *Space Jam* blanket, folded neatly in the bottom of a milk crate, sun-faded and worn thin at the corners the blood stains soaked into the fabric and turned slightly brown with age. It was tucked beneath a tangle of orange extension cords and a cracked Thermos. I don’t know why he kept it. Maybe he forgot it was even there.

But the second I saw it... I swear I felt twelve again  
and then that whole week came back… 

The one we never told anyone about.The one I thought I’d imagined until now.

***2003***

*MONDAY*

Monday morning, I woke up to the sound of birds tapping on the gutters and the muffled slam of a screen door somewhere down the street. April sun was slipping in through the blinds in soft golden stripes. I reached for the alarm clock, blinking at the numbers.

7:04AM.

School started in exactly twenty-six minutes. 

I rolled back over and coughed—dry, flat, fake. 

But I’d been rehearsing all weekend. Practicing in the mirror, rasping like I had strep, even holding the thermometer to the light bulb for a second too long before chickening out and shaking it back down.

I wasn’t sick.  
Not in the way my dad would understand.

I just... couldn’t go back.  
Not to the jokes.  
Not to Luke Bennett and his sharp elbows and sharper laugh.  
Not after what he whispered in gym class last Friday in front of everyone.

The door cracked open, and Mom peeked her head in. Her face lit up when she saw I was awake.  
“Hey, sweetie.”  
Her voice was soft and singsongy, like she used when I was sick for real. “You feel any better this morning?”

I shook my head dramatically and gave a weak little sniff. “Not really…”

She crossed the room and sat on the edge of the bed, brushing my bangs off my forehead. Her fingers were cool and gentle. I remember she was still in her bathrobe, the pink one with little blue flowers.

“You feel warm,” she said, though I was pretty sure I didn’t.

I didn’t say anything. I just gave her the most pitiful look I could manage.

“Okay,” she smiled, smoothing the blanket. “I’ll go talk to your dad, let him know you’re still sick and see what he says.”

She kissed my forehead and stood up, but before she reached the door, my older sister’s voice floated in—sarcastic and smug.

“Fake,” she said, peeking her head around the corner with a smirk. She was already dressed for school, backpack over one shoulder, highlighted hair pulled into a sloppy ponytail.

“Shut up, Tori,” I muttered, keeping my voice low so Mom wouldn’t hear.

“You better hope you’re actually faking it. Because if I catch the plague from you, I’ll kill you myself.”

I flipped her off.

She raised her eyebrows like she was gonna rat me out—but she didn’t. She just snorted and walked off, calling over her shoulder, “Enjoy your sick day, loser.”

Mom didn’t notice. Or pretended not to. She just shook her head, 

“Leave your brother alone, Victoria.” 

Mom walked away muttering something about the two of us being impossible and padded down the hall toward the kitchen.

After a few minutes I heard Dad's boots thud down the hall before he knocked twice on my door—he always knocked, even if he was already turning the handle.

My head wasn’t hot. My throat wasn’t sore. But I still pulled the covers up to my chin and added a few dry coughs for effect. 

I’d practiced them the night before.

 “Hey, you good buddy?”

I coughed again, this time with a little throat rasp. “I still don’t feel good.”

He stepped in. His dark work shirt was already tucked into his jeans, sleeves rolled up, the familiar “*Dale”* patch stitched over his chest. 

His hair was still wet from his shower, and he smelled like Irish Spring.

He crossed the room in two strides and laid a calloused hand on my forehead. His fingers smelled like engine oil

“Don’t feel like a fever,” he said. “But you’re pale.”

I didn’t say anything. Just looked up at him from the nest of blankets. The morning sun hit the side of his face, and for a second, I thought he looked tired. Not the kind of tired a nap would fix. The kind that just builds and builds until it lives in your bones.

He didn't press it. He never did when it came to me being sick. I think after my surgery, he started to believe I was made of glass. 

When I was 5 years old, I had a brain tumor, it was removed though and I was fine, but it scared the hell out of him and mom.  

“Just rest, okay?” he said, already halfway out the door. “I’m gonna work in the garage most of the day. You need anything, come get me.” 

He turned back toward the door, then paused. “You want anything? Waffles? Cereal?”

“Maybe toast.”

“Coming right up.”

He left without another word, humming something low and tuneless. I waited until I heard the faint clink of a toaster lever and the sound of the garage door creaking open before I climbed out of bed.

I spent the first couple hours exactly how I imagined: sprawled on the carpet, watching *The Amanda Show* on my old Zenith box TV, sipping Capri Sun through a chewed-up straw. My feet were cold. I didn’t mind.

The house felt... calm. Like it exhaled once the world left for work and school. I knew every sound it made. The way the fridge clicked when it kicked on. The creak of the hallway when you stepped just right. The faint *clunk* of the dryer vent in the wind.

But around 11AM, something was off.

I was halfway through a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, flipping through an old *Nintendo Power*, when I heard a thump.

Not from outside. Not from the garage.

From the hallway.

Just one. A soft thud, like a dropped shoe or someone stumbling. Then nothing.

I muted the TV and listened.

Silence.

I tried to laugh it off, but something in my chest pulled tight. The air suddenly felt heavy, like when a storm's about to roll in.

I crept to the hallway and peeked down it. Every door was shut... except the closet. The one by the bathroom. Its door stood cracked open just an inch—just enough to show darkness inside.

I hadn’t opened it. I was sure of it.

I stood there for a long time, heart punching the inside of my ribs. Then I grabbed the broom from the laundry room and—like an idiot—poked it shut from a distance.

*Click.*

I exhaled.

Later that afternoon, I asked Dad if he’d opened it earlier. He looked up from the engine he was working on, grease on his fingers and forehead.

“What closet?”

“The hallway one. By the bathroom.”

He shook his head, wiping sweat off his brow with the back of his arm. “Haven’t been inside the house all day.”

He didn’t say anything else. I think he chalked it up to imagination. Or nerves. Or both.

That night, I couldn’t sleep.

The ceiling fan rattled gently overhead, and the streetlamp outside my window painted familiar shadows on the wall. I pulled the blanket up to my chin and counted the blinking red numbers on my clock.

2:13AM.

I was just starting to drift off when I heard it.

A low hum. Not a sound I recognized. Not the fridge. Not the fan. Not the vent. It was inside the wall. Soft and vibrating, like a voice pressed through insulation.

Then... something moved across the ceiling.

Not a shadow.  
Not a trick of light.

Something that didn’t belong. Something crawling, but too smooth. Too slow. It passed just above me like a ripple in the plaster, just long enough for my breath to catch in my throat.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t move. I just laid there, every part of me rigid, listening to the silence that followed.

I didn’t know it then—but that was only the beginning.

NOW

I shuttered the memory away and pulled out my phone to write this just so I didn't forget.

I tucked the blanket into my jeep and decided to drive home for the night. I have to come back to do more work in the garage and it's already so late...",2,1749447274.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

I was having a rough Sunday mid (2-3 person play all afternoon) at my store, working the second half of my double, completely lost of all motivation to keep working; and I take a little girl's order in the cafe today. She was with her grandma but she ordered all on her own. 

Her demeanor (confident, bright eyed, proud of herself for ordering her own drinks) reminded me a lot of my daughter, who's around her age. So I went out of my way to make sure I made her drinks and drew 2 little animals on them. 

I hand out her drinks and her reaction to seeing the drawings on her cups made my entire day. She kept pointing them out to her grandma over and over, and they both thanked me profusely for it. It honestly put me in such a good mood again for the rest of my shift. I'm also a huge crybaby so I had to take a breather in the back to have myself a little happy cry. I absolutely adore kids and I personally love seeing them smile and hearing them laugh.  

My SM doesn't work on Sundays and she was probably too busy with packing for her all expense paid trip to Vegas starting tomorrow, so I wasn't worried about being chided about the content being written on the cup. 

Writing on cups shouldn't be forced, we should feel inspired after having a nice interaction with a customer. I know we sell subpar coffee and 3D printed food but the community I've built working for the siren is unlike any other job I've worked, and I've worked many.

If the requirements are not met, even if the potion is taken, there will be no ""resurrection"" and the person will die completely.

Sequence 2: Servant of the Secret

Main materials: Dark Wolf's skin or the extraordinary characteristics of ""Mother of Heaven"" Philanias ;

Supplementary materials: 300 ml of Dark Wolf's blood, information about the spirit world of a secret place, a feather of a feathered serpent, 10 drops of blood of the ""Warrior"" giant ;

Ritual: Cut off all social relations and contact with all external things, do not try to influence others, and cannot be influenced by others, live alone in darkness and silence for three years without going crazy (Note: Wherever there is a time limit, the ""Time Worm"" can take advantage of BUGs, but in this ritual, the passage of time cannot be directly accelerated to reduce the actual time required, because this is equivalent to affecting the ascendants and destroying the basic conditions of the ritual. They may need a little help from the ""Fool"" or ""Fate"" to achieve their goals) .

Sequence 1: Knight of Disaster

Main material: One copy of the extraordinary characteristic of ""Misfortune Knight""  ;

Supplementary materials: a ""fate"" blessing written on paper, a breath of the underworld or the kingdom of twilight, and 600 ml of blood shed from the serious injury suffered by the person;

Ritual: Bring disaster to an archangel or a civilization, a continent, or a planet (Note: In simple terms, it is equivalent to ""your disaster is me"").

Sequence 0: Darkness

Main material: ""Darkness"" uniqueness + three ""Misfortune Knight"" characteristics ;

Supplementary materials: a moon or a moon-like star (equivalent in mystical concepts) ;

Ritual: Let a uniqueness, a kingdom of God, or a true God rest in eternal sleep (the higher the difficulty of the ritual, the better the effect) .

i was dx with graves march 2025. i started taking methimazole 10mg and metoprolol, and i had gained 10lbs (115lb —> 125lb) within 1 month. i have always struggled with weight gain, so this took a huge toll on me. so i started working out everyday after gaining weight (10,000 steps, while keep bpm under 136 so i dont stress my body) and eating nearly 500-900 calories less per day, but i didnt shed a single pound! 

i’m not sure what happened, but as of 1 month ago (~may 15th, 2025), i sort of gave up. i just accepted that i was 10lbs heavier and decided that i would just be cautious about what i ate. i stopped working out and stopped counting calories. instead, i walk leisurely outside instead of taking the bus if applicable (maybe 1-2 miles?) and i’ve just been cautious about the ingredients i eat, avoiding added sugars and gluten. this has resulted in me losing 6ish pounds! 

for example: 

morning: 
- 3/4 cup yogurt with 1 tbsp of chia seeds, blueberries, granola, my cup of coffee or matcha

lunch: 
- pasta, ground beef w/ taco seasoning, spinach 
- or pasta salad 

dinner: 
- i’m in school so i just eat what i ate for lunch LOL
or sweet potatoes, ground beef, salad 

snacks: 
- granola bar and nuts mix 

** i try my best to cut out sugar, alcohol, gluten ** 

i didn’t see any positive posts about losing weight and i was definitely discouraged in the beginning. but if you are in the same boat as me, it’s definitely possible, you got this!

Just a door away, the conversation in that hospital corner continued.  
  
""Get ready. While Celia's still unconscious, go ahead and perform the hysterectomy!""  
  
Dr. Davis stood there, completely stunned.  
  
""You want to remove Mrs.Ravenscroft's uterus?!""  
  
""Mr. Ravenscroft, I have to remind you—you don't have any children right now. If you really remove your wife's uterus, you'll never have an heir!""  
  
""I don't need an heir. Ashley gave birth to my child yesterday. I promised her I'd leave everything to our baby. Keeping Celia's uterus... it's a threat.""  
  
The doctor looked pained, speaking urgently,""But your child with Miss Green will still take someone else's name, call someone else daddy. Mr. Ravenscroft, is this really worth it? Besides, after seven miscarriages,Mrs.Ravenscroft's chances of getting pregnant again are already so low.""  
  
Dante lit a cigar, his voice tender yet bitter.  
  
""Worth it? There's no question about worth. I love Ashley, and I'll give her everything I have.""  
  
""But—""  
  
Dante's brow furrowed.  
  
""Enough! Just do what I fucking told you!""  
  
Just as Dante was about to get up, his phone rang. He accidentally hit speakerphone.  
  
""Dante, bro, got the money! Heh, call me for this kind of gig anytime. I've done it seven times now—got it down to a science. And next time, I've got it all planned out. I'll pretend to be a kidnapper and go straight for the wife's belly—""  
  
""There won't be a next time. Take your money and get the hell out of the city!""  
  
Footsteps echoed from inside.  
  
I stumbled back to my room, barely making it before Dante walked in.  
  
""Celia, when did you wake up?""  
  
I was drenched in sweat, my body trembling as I tried to stay calm.  
  
""Just now... I noticed you weren't here, so I was about to go look for you.""  
  
Dante's gaze fixed on me, studying, suspicious.  
  
My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might explode. Just when I thought he'd figured it out, he picked me up and placed me back on the bed.  
  
""How can you be so careless with yourself? We've already lost the baby—I can't lose you too.""  
  
The fucking nerve of him to even mention it.  
  
Thinking about my babies—the ones he'd deliberately killed—I clutched my chest as tears threatened to overflow.  
  
All those car accidents, robberies, falls... none of it was coincidence.  
  
It was my husband. For his mistress. Again and again, he'd tried to kill me.  
  
""The doctor said your uterus wasn't properly cleaned out. You need another surgery.""  
  
""Don't be scared, Celia. We'll have a beautiful baby someday—with your eyes and my nose and mouth. When that happens, we'll love him twice as much, make up for everything we've lost.""  
  
Dante handed me a glass of milk. As he turned slightly, I caught him slipping something into it.  
  
He held me close, whispering sweet comfort, his eyes full of what looked like genuine concern.  
  
But I knew better. This was all just another lie to keep me quiet.  
  
""Do I... do I have to drink this? Can't I skip it?""  
  
Dante, you've killed seven of my children. Now you want to take away my last chance to be a mother too?  
  
Without hesitation, he stroked my hair with that indulgent smile,  
  
""Come on, you're a grown woman acting like a little kid. If you don't have the surgery, how will your body heal? You want me to be heartbroken?""  
  
""Here, let me help you.""  
  
He brought the milk to my lips, giving me no choice but to drink.  
  
I squeezed my eyes shut. It felt like I was swallowing razor blades instead of milk.  
  
My consciousness began to fade. Through the haze, I saw that corrupt doctor walking in.  
  
""Start the surgery now. And also...""  
  
Dante's voice hesitated for a few seconds.  
  
""Find a way to use the anesthesia to paralyze her legs.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
""Mr. Ravenscroft, is this really necessary? Isn't this a bit... extreme?""  
  
""Just do what I fucking said!""  
  
I knew Dante was always cautious and paranoid, but I never imagined that just seeing me wake up early would make him this ruthless.  
  
My children, my chance at motherhood, and now even my ability to stand—he wanted to take it all away.  
  
Dante, is this how you're going to destroy me completely?  
  
I screamed in despair, struggling to sit up, but I was sinking deeper into unconsciousness.  
  
As the anesthesia began to wear off, I heard the doctor's voice through the haze,  
  
""Mr. Ravenscroft, Mrs. Ravenscroft's uterus has been removed. And... she'll never walk again.""  
  
Dante sounded absolutely delighted""Good! Excellent!""  
  
When I finally came to, his tears were falling on my hands—such convincing, heartbroken performance.  
  
""Celia, the doctor says your uterus was infected... you'll never be able to have children in the rest of your live.""  
  
I ignored him, frantically trying to move my legs.  
  
But there was nothing... no feeling at all.  
  
I broke down completely, sobbing as I demanded,""Dante, what the hell did you do to my legs?""  
  
Tears streamed down his face as he choked up, barely able to speak.  
  
""There was a complication with the anesthesia... you're paralyzed from the waist down.""  
  
""Don't be scared, Celia... no matter what happens to you, I'll never leave you, I'll always love you.""  
  
I never knew Dante was such a damn good actor.  
  
He dismissed the nurses and took care of everything himself—feeding me soup, cleaning my body, even dealing with the postpartum bleeding.  
  
He worked tirelessly until evening, then kissed my forehead tenderly.  
  
""Celia, you've suffered so much carrying our babies. I promise I'll make it up to you.""  
  
I looked at his exhausted face and coldly turned away.  
  
""If you're tired, get some sleep.""  
  
""Alright, I'll stay right here. Just call me if you need anything.""  
  
Once he fell asleep, I grabbed his other phone.  
  
I'd always known Dante had a second phone—his work phone—but I'd never bothered checking it.  
  
It unlocked on the first try.  
  
The password was Ashley Green's birthday.  
  
The moment the screen lit up, I was staring at a wedding photo of him and Ashley.  
  
A fucking wedding photo...  
  
He'd actually taken wedding photos with Ashley. The sight of that white dress made my eyes hurt.  
  
With trembling fingers, I opened his messages. Dante called her ""baby""...  
  
Pages and pages of chat history. The more I read, the more horrified I became.  
  
Every single business trip he'd taken was just an excuse to be with Ashley.  
  
I'd gotten upset so many times because he never came with me to doctor appointments.  
  
How many times had doctors asked about the baby's father, and I'd just smile awkwardly and say he was in business.  
  
He'd always take forever to reply,  
  
""I'm working to earn money for our baby. Besides, checkups aren't a big deal. I can't really help anyway, and it would just waste time. You can handle it yourself,all right?""  
  
But he went to every single one of Ashley's prenatal appointments. No matter how busy he was, he never missed one.  
  
He said he couldn't wait for their baby to be born, that she and their child were the most precious things in his world.  
  
As I kept reading, my heart felt like it was being ripped apart.  
  
Every time I got pregnant, they'd discuss how to kill my baby.  
  
Even that car accident when I was pregnant a year ago—Ashley hit me herself.  
  
She said she wanted to experience the thrill of hitting someone, and Dante was all for it.  
  
His only concern was""Just don't hit too hard.""  
  
They talked about hurting me, about killing my children, as casually as discussing the weather.  
  
My nails dug so deep into my palms that blood dripped onto the sheets.  
  
I opened the photo album—thousands of pictures, all featuring Ashley. Selfies, candid shots, the two of them waking up together, taking walks, going home, Dante lovingly preparing nutritious meals for her pregnancy...  
  
There were 99+ videos too. I clicked on them and felt like someone had dumped ice water over me.  
  
Countless videos of them naked, intertwined, sexed,like they were documenting every intimate moment.  
  
There was even cosplay shit—Dante in a maid outfit, kneeling on the floor...  
  
I pressed my hand to my stomach, too nauseous to speak.  
  
Besides those videos, there were six more labeled ""First,"" ""Second,"" all the way up to ""Sixth.""  
  
Realizing what they were, my blood ran cold and I tasted copper in my throat.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I bit my lip hard and clicked on the sixth video.  
  
Dante and Ashley were chatting and laughing together.  
  
Right in front of them was...  
  
That blade might as well have been cutting into my own flesh. My heart felt like it was being sliced into a thousand pieces, and my stomach began cramping violently.  
  
I couldn't hold it back anymore—I leaned over the bed and dry heaved uncontrollably.  
  
I didn't sleep all night, tears soaking through my hospital gown.  
  
The next morning, Dante brought me breakfast as usual—a thoughtful spread he'd personally picked out.  
  
Such variety: coffee,hamburger, bread, sandwich...  
  
I used to think this was his way of spoiling me. Now I realized it was just thoughtless, half-hearted bullshit.  
  
Remembering last night's videos, I started dry heaving again.  
  
Seeing my distress, Dante looked genuinely concerned,""Still feeling sick? Fuck, this is all my fault. I hate seeing you suffer like this.""  
  
""It's nothing. I want to go home.""  
  
Dante's expression froze for just a moment.  
  
""You just had another miscarriage... Mom's not too satisfied about it. If you go back now, you'll just walk right into her rage. Maybe wait a bit longer? Save yourself the grief.""  
  
I didn't respond, but from his expression, I could guess what was really going on.  
  
That afternoon, while he was out, I packed my things and wheeled myself home.  
  
The moment I entered the house, I saw Ashley sitting in Dante's lap while they both played with a baby.  
  
Dante's mom,Sophia came out of the kitchen carrying a bowl of chicken soup, personally feeding Ashley spoonful by spoonful.  
  
The three of them were laughing together like the perfect family.  
  
When she saw me come in, Sophia's eyes turned razor-sharp.  
  
""You cursed bitchHow dare you show your face here! We promised you everything, and how do you repay us? Someone as unlucky as you should've just died out there!""  
  
""You knew damn well you were pregnant, but you kept running around like a maniac. How many of our babies have you destroyed? Why the hell didn't that fall just kill you, you worthless piece of trash!""  
  
""I'm telling you right now—from today on, Ashley is my only daughter-in-law!Get the fuck out of my house!""  
  
Ashley followed Sophia's gaze and looked over at me, her eyes gleaming with satisfaction,  
  
""Mom, don't say things like that. What if she gets jealous and starts spreading rumors about me seducing Dante?""  
  
""Let's see if she dares!""  
  
I knew Sophia had never liked me. She thought I was too strong-willed, too hard to control, that I'd walk all over Dante after marriage.  
  
But Ashley was beautiful and sweet-talking, always putting Sophia and Dante at the center of everything. So Sophia had always wanted Ashley as Mrs.Ravenscroft.  
  
It was only after Ashley married some rich guy and I willingly gave up my career to focus on family that Sophia reluctantly accepted me.  
  
After years of not giving the family an heir, her dissatisfaction with me had reached its peak.  
  
Now that Ashley was back and had given Dante a son, Sophia felt free to unleash all her pent-up resentment on me.  
  
But she had no idea that all seven of my miscarriages were personally orchestrated by her precious son!  
  
Every single one of her grandsons had been killed by Ashley—the daughter-in-law she treasured so much.  
  
In the past, Dante would try to mediate. But now, holding the child Ashley had given him, he acted like he couldn't hear any of it.  
  
Ashley snuggled into his arms, her voice deliberately pouty,  
  
""Dante, baby,you're paying so much attention to our son that I'm feeling left out. If you keep this up, I'm going to get upset.""  
  
Dante affectionately pinched her cheek, his eyes full of tenderness.  
  
""I know you get jealous easily. Look what I have for you.""  
  
I followed Ashley's gaze and saw the words ""Share Transfer Agreement"" blazing before my eyes.  
  
""Oh wow! Dante, you're so good to me!""  
  
She kissed him on the corner of his mouth, her eyes smugly meeting mine.  
  
I gave her a cold smile in return.  
  
Enjoy it while you can.  
  
It won't be long before you and your precious Dante are crying and begging me to come back...

On the twenty-seventh floor of an indifferent glass tower, Harold Fray typed numbers into cells. The spreadsheet pulsed dimly, green and gray—a stale aurora. Overhead, fluorescent lights buzzed with the tired enthusiasm of old ideas. His fingers moved mechanically, tracking expenses no one would read, populating charts that resembled fractals of meaninglessness. He paused, blinked, and glanced at the time: 3:17 PM. Hadn’t it just been 3:14? Or was it still?

He opened a blank document and titled it *Entropy: A Daily Log*. Below the heading, he typed:

>

He sat back and looked around. The office was in slow decay. The recycling bin overflowed with unclaimed printouts. One of the overhead bulbs was dimming to an orange flicker, casting strange shadows on Pam’s unused standing desk. On the carpet, a coffee stain had spread slightly overnight, like a galaxy in bloom.

Harold had read once that entropy was the measure of disorder in a closed system. That without intervention, systems tend toward chaos. He began to suspect that their office was not just a workplace, but a perfect case study—an isolated pocket of increasing entropy. Like the universe, it had started with order: fresh paint, working Keurig, optimistic onboarding brochures. Over time, without anyone noticing, it had sagged into disarray.

**Wednesday:**

>

He began a chart—an “Entropy Index”—to measure the daily disorder. It had categories: ""Temperature Fluctuations,” “Item Misplacement,” “Unclaimed Lost and Found,” “Ambiguous Memos,” and “General Existential Ambiguity.” The highest score yet was a 9.2 on a day when HR mistakenly sent out twenty termination notices due to a software glitch. The apologies, Harold noted, were emailed two hours later and marked “Low Importance.”

**Friday:**

>

He stood at the window during lunch, watching the streets below. Cars moved like cells in a Petri dish. People crossed intersections with the unthinking grace of entropy itself—drifting, adjusting, flowing. From this height, the city felt less like a marvel of design and more like a byproduct of energy loss. All this motion, he thought, and for what?

In a quiet moment, Harold remembered a line from physics class: *Energy becomes less useful over time.* He wondered if his energy, once precise and useful, had diffused into ambient, aimless motion. Had he once had a purpose here? Or had it always been like this?

**Two Weeks Later:**

Harold stopped updating the index. The disorder was now self-evident.

Filing cabinets no longer closed properly. Email chains spiraled into recursive loops. A mysterious ""Jeff from IT"" sent a company-wide email reminding everyone to ""Embrace the cascade."" No one knew who Jeff was. He did not appear in the company directory.

In a fit of inspiration, Harold borrowed a whiteboard and began to sketch thermodynamic diagrams. He mapped energy inputs (coffee, salary, daylight) against entropy outputs (emails, Slack pings, emotional fatigue). The line chart resembled a rollercoaster with no peaks.

When colleagues walked by, they glanced at him sideways, unsure whether he was mad or brilliant. No one asked.

**Final Log:**

>

That evening, Harold stood in the empty office. Desks loomed like monoliths. The quiet was immense. He could feel the end state of all things—not with dread, but with a strange peace.

He turned off his monitor, removed his lanyard, and placed it on the desk like a relic. On his way out, he passed the printer, which was still blinking *ERROR 405: PAPER JAM*, although it had no paper in it.

Outside, the wind scattered paper across the sidewalk. Harold didn’t chase them. He simply watched as they tumbled—whiteness folding over itself, data erased by motion.

At home, he dismantled his bookshelf. He unplugged the TV. He turned off his phone. Then he sat in the center of his small, silent apartment, letting things settle. Disorder would come. It always did.

But tonight, he would meet it halfway.",1,1749446124.0,aistory,0,1.0,False

- Furnished (we all brought our own furniture and essentials like a sofa and a tv, and you can use all of them during your stay. We also share the kitchen stuff like silverware, pots, bread cooker, rice cooker, and more. If you need, we can provide you the beds too.) 
- We have no pet- pets are welcome but you need to pay $300 non-refundable pet fee + monthly pet rent of $25 per month per pet.

The rent is $1,978, we equally divide it by 4= $494.50 a month affordably. So if you’re moving alone, that will be $989/mo or split $494.50 with your roommate. 

Monthly utilities will be $10 wifi + $30 ish sewer + $30 ish electricity, of course could be more or less.

Even Eric’s family and colleagues bombarded me with calls, inquiring about the situation—some even offered to help bring him back, free of charge.  
  
I had just come out of the delivery room, yet I calmly hung up on call after call.  
  
After all, when Eric saw the news of his ex-girlfriend, Aria, a war correspondent, caught in the crossfire of a terror attack, he left me—his pregnant wife—to fly over and make sure she was safe.  
  
Back then, I was leaking amniotic fluid, clutching my swollen belly, and I asked him:  
  
“Are you really going to abandon your wife and unborn daughter to go into a war zone? Eric, if you go, I will not be responsible for the consequences.”  
  
Eric had taken all our bank books and passports and shouted at me, “You and the baby aren’t going to die anytime soon—she, on the other hand, could be dead the next second!”  
  
“You’re just giving birth. Haven’t you always been strong?” With that, he slammed the door and left.  
  
So, if he’s the one throwing his life away, why should I save him?  
  
——————  
  
Eric loved watching international news. I never understood why—until two days ago when a news report aired.  
  
A female war correspondent had been captured by terrorists during an interview.  
  
The footage lasted only a second, but I recognized her immediately—Aria, the most famous anchor on the international channel.  
  
At that moment, I was nine months pregnant, about to go into labor. Sitting in a rocking chair in the living room, I rested my hand on my belly and felt a pang of sympathy for the journalist.  
  
The next second, Eric knocked over the fruit bowl in a panic.  
  
He stood up so quickly that his knee slammed into the corner of the coffee table.  
  
The impact looked so painful that even I winced, but Eric didn’t seem to feel a thing.  
  
He staggered into the kitchen for a glass of water but accidentally hit the hot water button, scalding himself so badly he dropped the glass, shattering it.  
  
Ignoring his reddened, burned skin, he rushed into the bedroom and slammed the door shut behind him.  
  
An hour later, Eric finally emerged.  
  
“I… I have to go on a business trip.”  
  
I slowly stood up, hand still resting on my belly.  
  
“Eric, my due date is in the next couple of days. I could go into labor at any time. It’s not a good time for a trip. What if the contractions start suddenly?”  
  
“You know my mother died in childbirth with my younger brother. I’m genuinely terrified of giving birth.”  
  
“Didn’t you say the thing you were most looking forward to was being the first person our daughter saw when she opened her eyes?”  
  
Eric’s face paled, but after a moment, he said, “This trip is really important to me—I have to go. But don’t worry, I’ll definitely be back before you give birth.”  
  
I gave him a broken smile.  
  
Even though the pain in my belly was already sharp and spasmodic, and fluid was trickling down my legs like a faucet had been turned on.  
  
“I’ll agree. But Eric, I want you to know—whatever consequences come from this trip, you’ll face them alone. I won’t bear any of it for you.”  
  
Maybe my expression was too solemn, because Eric’s body trembled slightly.  
  
Then, as if swearing an oath, he said, “Don’t worry, I’ll come back safely.”  
  
With that, he rushed into the room, hastily packed a few items of clothing, and shoved on his shoes, ready to leave.  
  
Just as he was about to walk out the door, I couldn’t stop myself. I softened and called out to him.  
  
“Eric, wait a second.”  
  
He turned back, visibly irritated.  
  
“Didn’t you already say I could go? Why are you calling me back now?”  
  
Clutching my hand tightly into a fist, the pain in my belly intensifying, I remained calm.  
  
“You forgot your passport.”  
  
I dragged my body, still leaking amniotic fluid, back into the bedroom.  
  
I brought him his passport, and then handed him a bank card.  
  
That card held every paycheck Eric had transferred to me over the seven years of our marriage.  
  
His hand trembled slightly as he took the passport and the card, and even his eyes began to redden.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
For a moment, I thought he might stay.  
  
But instead, he stuffed the card and passport into his bag and swore again:  
  
“I promise I’ll be back before the baby comes.”  
  
Then he slammed the door and left in a rush.  
  
I listened to the echo of the door slamming shut in our now-empty home and calmly called the maternity ward and a postnatal care center.  
  
A man who didn’t even notice my water had broken dared to swear he’d return in time for the birth.  
  
How laughable.  
  
Eric and I met through a mountaineering club.  
  
Back then, I worked at a tech company under intense pressure. I regularly worked overtime, and the only time I could breathe was on weekends when I hiked to recover some energy.  
  
He joined the club in my second year there. At first, we were just regular teammates, but we always charged ahead together, always the first to reach the summit. Over time, we grew close.  
  
He worked in investment banking.  
  
I worked in internet tech.  
  
He liked hiking, running, and working out.  
  
So did I.  
  
When we summited our hundredth mountain, he confessed his love to me.  
  
No fancy words, no over-the-top romance.  
  
Just one sentence: “Freya, let’s be together.”  
  
I agreed.  
  
Not because he was especially charming—my father was the king of romance. When he pursued my mother, he lit up half the city with fireworks and even got arrested for disturbing the peace.  
  
But that passion ultimately destroyed my mother. When she was pregnant with their second child, my father’s mistress showed up, deliberately provoking my mother who was about to go into labor—and it killed her on the operating table.  
  
So I’d long since realized: romance is cheap. Reliability is what matters.  
  
And Eric was reliable.  
  
He was never late.  
  
His gifts were always cliché, but he never forgot a single occasion.  
  
He wouldn’t pick me up when it rained, but the moment I called, he’d come without hesitation.  
  
So, after three years of dating, we got married.  
  
Married life wasn’t much different from before.  
  
We split chores equally. On holidays, we took turns choosing vacation spots—one trip to a place he liked, one to a place I liked.  
  
It was calm, orderly, and uneventful.  
  
I once believed I was made for this kind of life.  
  
Until three years ago, when one of his college friends got married, and he brought me along to the wedding.  
  
At the bachelor party, one of his very drunk friends pulled him aside and cried:  
  
“Eric, seeing you like this—with no spark in your eyes—breaks my heart.”  
  
“I’m getting married tomorrow. I’m finally stepping into happiness. But you… you’re like someone who’s locked his heart away.”  
  
“If Aria hadn’t insisted on becoming a war reporter, you wouldn’t have ended up like this.”  
  
I saw Eric glance at me, instinctively.  
  
He quickly explained, “He’s drunk. Don’t listen to him.”  
  
I just smiled and said nothing.  
  
On the way home, leaning in the passenger seat, I said calmly, “I don’t ask for much in a partner. But the one thing I need is for him to be over his ex.”  
  
He stood where the hallway light couldn’t reach, so I couldn’t see his expression.  
  
But from that night on, the name Aria vanished from our lives.  
  
Until now.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Because I hadn’t been answering calls.  
  
I had just finished nursing our daughter at the postnatal center and was about to put her to sleep when the door suddenly flew open.  
  
It was my mother-in-law, Victoria.  
  
She rushed in, her voice trembling:  
  
“Freya, why haven’t you been answering your phone? William’s at the embassy, practically losing his mind!”  
  
“Come home with me right now. Bring Eric’s passport and documents—we have to get to the embassy immediately and confirm what’s happening.”  
  
William was my father-in-law.  
  
I didn’t respond right away. I calmly said six digits: “2-1-0-6-3-0.”  
  
She froze.  
  
I carefully tucked the blanket around my daughter before slowly explaining, “That’s the code to the front door. If you need his documents, you can get them yourself.”  
  
Victoria’s hands trembled.  
  
“Freya, how can you be so cold? Eric is in a war zone—his life’s in danger.”  
  
“He sent a group message asking for help. He’s been shot in the leg and is hiding in a stranger’s home, trying to dodge gunfire!”  
  
“I know you just had surgery and need time to recover, but this is an emergency. Can’t you just come with me to the embassy, just once?”  
  
She was shaking all over, looking like she might break down at any second.  
  
I still spoke calmly. “I knew he was injured. Before he sent out that mass message, he had already sent me several desperate pleas for help. I didn’t reply.”  
  
Victoria staggered, nearly losing her balance.  
  
I looked at her, and I won’t deny I wavered a little inside.  
  
After all, for the past seven years, she had treated me well. During the years I was without a mother, she had filled that void.  
  
But all of that had already been destroyed—by Eric himself.  
  
I took a USB drive from the nightstand and handed it to her.  
  
“This is a recording of the conversation between me and Eric that night. Watch it first, then we’ll talk.”  
  
Victoria took it with trembling hands. When the video ended, she collapsed to the floor. Her lips quivered for a long time before she finally managed to speak.  
  
“Freya… you have to believe me. Nothing ever happened between Eric and Aria.”  
  
I still couldn’t harden my heart completely. Even though the pain from my C-section was still sharp, I forced myself to get out of bed and helped her up.  
  
Just like that day when Eric left—I had already gone into labor, my water had broken—but I still softened and handed him his passport and bank card.  
  
I said gently, “I know nothing physical happened between him and Aria. But the fact that he was willing to leave his wife and unborn child behind to fly into a war zone for her—that says everything about his choice.”  
  
“He was willing to let my daughter be born without her father. He was willing to let me face the surgery alone. A man like that should be held accountable for his decisions.”  
  
As I spoke, Victoria’s face grew paler and paler. In the end, she didn’t argue further.  
  
Maybe even she couldn’t find a reason to convince me.  
  
She finally gave up and stood up, her body trembling. “You… get some rest. I’ll leave now.”  
  
She walked out the door looking like she’d aged ten years in an instant, stumbling as she went.  
  
Although I truly felt sorry for her, I still called out before she could leave completely.  
  
“Victoria, let me know sometime this week when you and William can move out of that apartment.”  
  
They had been living in a property I had fully paid for, ever since I got married.  
  
Victoria turned back, exhaustion written all over her face.  
  
“Do you really have to rush this? Can’t you wait a little?”  
  
I shook my head.  
  
“Did Eric wait? When he left, he didn’t even take me—whose water had already broken—to the hospital first. He just flew out of the country.”  
  
“I just want all the marital property matters settled before he comes back.”

1l6wj7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l6wj7r/i_think_my_mother_is_a_serial_killer/,I think my mother is a serial killer.,"As the title says, I suspect my mother is a serial killer. A few days ago I was clearing some stuff out of the attic when I found a weird looking wooden box with some eyes painted on it tucked away in the corner. Being my overly curious self, I looked inside and found it was packed with journals and letters. I read them, and I seriously can’t tell if this was some weird fiction she wrote or were accurate accounts of her life before I was born, but either way, I don’t want to ask. Some of the shit written here is dark. 

I have no idea where else to share this in case it does end up being fiction, so here it goes, entry one: 

——————————————————————————


“Hey there pretty lady, what are you doing out here in the dark? It’s starting to snow if you didn’t know.”

I sighed. It was too cold for this shit. But I knew the type and figured it would be best if I at least acknowledged him. 

My boots squelched in the mud as I approached the idling truck. When I was close enough to see his ruddy, bearded face I shrugged, and in a well-crafted monotone designed to sound as unappealing as possible said, “walking.” 

He guffawed and leaned over to unlock his passenger-side door. “Hop on in, I’ll give you a ride.” He said that last part with a not so subtle wink. 

I humored him and took a look inside. The seats and floors were littered with wrappers and bottles. It smelled terrible too. Like a mixture of sweat and cigarettes. I also noticed a large knife jammed between his seat and the center console. I took a step back and stared up at him, silent. 

I was far too young when I first started attracting the attention of older men, and it had only gotten worse with time. Nothing seemed to help. I tried heavy hoodies and cargo pants, barely maintaining my short brown hair with some scissors in my pack, and constantly wearing big sunglasses that hid eyes the color of ice. Though sometimes they were storm-blue. Depends on who you ask. 

Yet always, always, I drew them in. I wish I knew why. It certainly wasn’t my body. Years on the road had kept me lean, and I tried my best to get rid of my natural curves through fasting and intense exercise, though it didn’t help much. They lingered, and I was still, according to a lot of people, ‘beautiful.’ Pair that with the spray of freckles across my nose and lack of affect in my tone and you got a girl who often had to take drastic measures to be left alone. 

He frowned, confused. Tried waving a couple of times, but I kept staring. As if on cue, I watched his face twist when I didn’t respond to him flirting. “Oh, so that’s how it is huh? Am I being too nice to ya? Want me to be meaner? I heard that’s how y’all like us to be these days.” He paused, again waiting for me to respond or at least react, but I didn’t. He turned red as a tomato. “Answer me damn it,” he growled. 

I tightened the straps on my pack, gave him the finger, and headed towards the gas station across the street. I really needed to stock up on supplies. I heard him cursing and yelling after me, but I ignored it. Most of the time, that was enough. These kinds of men, as a rule, were cowards. 

I hummed to myself as tiny specks of snow drifted down from the darkening sky. I stuck out my tongue and caught a few. It was fun feeling them melt. The wind picked up and carried a nasty bite with it, leaving me wondering whether I should have taken the offered ride. I had seen people freeze to death in temperatures like this, and there wasn’t a motel for miles. 

I passed by the gas pumps and rifled through the trash for a bit. You’d be surprised what you find in gas station trash cans. I’ve found food still in its packaging, clothes, and more. The gloves I wore came from the trash, actually. They had rubber grips and provided good insulation. I sighed — there wasn’t much in these here cans outside of a half full liquor bottle. Oh well. Can’t get lucky all the time. I was about to step inside the station when I heard the truck pull into the lot and screech to a stop. 

Gas billowed out the exhaust and stained the air. The driver killed the engine, slammed his door open, and started towards me. He was huge. Easily over three hundred pounds and it wasn’t all fat. At his hip was a revolver built to match his size. I tensed, considering whether I should make space or get closer. The only tools I had on me for self-defense were a bayonet passed down to me by my father and some pepper spray. 

My indecision cost me. He was too close for me to grab either in time now. I eyed the gas station attendant behind the counter and made myself look pleading, but the reedy, spectacled boy went back to his magazine, unbothered by the threatened woman outside. 

“You little bitch. What makes you think you can tease me with that pouty mouth and get away with it? Come here.” He reached for me with his hairy hands. I forced out a yelp and staggered backwards, throwing an arm up across my face in defense. 

“Please, don’t hurt me,” I begged. 

“Should have thought about that before all that teasing of yours,” he snarled. He dug his hands into my hair and yanked me away from the door. I screamed and shouted until my voice was hoarse. But this was the rural Midwest. No one was coming. Not at this hour. He took me past his truck and out towards the tree line behind the gas station, where there were no cameras. He kept calling me a bitch under his breath and said it was my fault he had to do this. I slapped at his arms but the strikes were ineffective. 

After we were well hidden from view, I was tossed up against a tree, the impact slightly lessened by my pack. Clods of snow fell from the branches and hit us both. He shook his head, swearing, and leaned in. I could feel hot breaths and spit on my face and neck along with the terrible reek of alcohol. I hoped it would be over quick. I always hoped that. 

With bleary eyes he looked my body over and licked his lips. “I hate that y’all make me do this,” he whispered as he pressed his bulk up against me, hands fumbling at my clothes. 

A wicked smile suddenly cut across my face like ice breaking on a frozen lake. He stopped, stunned by the sudden change of emotion, then gaped in surprise at the needle poking in his neck. “The hell…” he muttered before crashing down. 

———————————————————————————

I stoked the fire and waited for Gabe to wake up. Initially I wasn’t sure if the dosage would be enough to put down a man double the size of my normal targets, but hey, it worked! I left him naked and propped upright against a large rock, bound at the wrists and ankles with rope. At his feet, I laid my personal treasures. Currently, I was in possession of only eight pairs. They were so shrunken and black that the untrained eye could be forgiven for thinking I carried pebbles in a jar of preservative. But what was often the case was that my captives would see the jar and feel their bindings and consequently know what was to befall them. 

I felt giddy with a happiness that eluded me outside of moments like this. A true joy that radiated throughout my entire being. Here I could allow my very soul to enter my voice and sing to the men who were the most vital part of this sacred dance. So I sang, the firelight casting my shadow across the cave walls as I pirouetted and flowed, ready to begin Gabe’s much needed operation. 

Unfortunately, I was lacking in anesthetic!

I heard him begin to moan, and when his eyes finally opened I was there to greet him. “Smile, beautiful!” He howled. I laughed. 

——————————————————————————

The next morning found me resting my head on the countertop of the first diner I had spotted off the highway. 

I had torn into a stack of pancakes and downed two cups of black coffee before the waitress could come back and ask how everything was going. What could I say, it was my comfort food. My dad’s too. It always made me feel a bit better  to splurge after she took over. The older woman who worked there, Kathy, ended up bringing me an extra plate of bacon and eggs on the house because it looked like ‘I needed it.’ 

I thanked her, though it bothered me that I stood out enough for her to notice me. That told me I should get going soon, but I was shaken up. 

Typically, when Kali took over, it was for a relatively short length of time and I was able to, on some level, influence certain choices she made. But this time around, she had retained control for an entire night. I was forced to spectate, my inner voice silenced completely, as she went above and beyond with Gabe. There was hardly anything of him left by the time the wolves got to his remains. I felt control return only after I was on the highway but by then it was too late. I was in possession of Gabe’s truck. 

I drove deep into the woods at my first opportunity and ditched the vehicle, hoping the still falling snow would cover my tracks. I cursed Kali over and over for taking too many risks and walked the next six miles until I arrived at the diner. I felt her there the whole time floating within my subconscious, singing her death-song, a wide feline-smile on her face. Don’t ask me what she is. I have no clue. I simply woke up one day and knew she was there, hungry for violence. 

“Good riddance I say,” clucked Kathy, her eyes glued to the TV screen. She shook her head and motioned to me with the remote. “That’s why I hate to see a girl traveling alone. You aren’t here alone, right?”

On the news they were reporting the story of a hero police officer and loving father of three who had gone missing the night before with the last remaining footage of him being a CCTV clip of him escorting away a ‘thief’ from a gas station which, according to the reporter, was his favorite to visit while on duty. There were multiple angles captured that night, and when one of them showed my face I felt a sinking feeling in my gut. 

Kathy grew visibly tense and tried her best not to  make it obvious that she was glancing my way, but I caught it. I slid off the stool and started towards the door. 

“Wait dear!” Kathy called. She rushed around the counter as fast as her aged legs would allow. 

I don’t know why I waited. Everything within me except for Kali was screaming to run. I was afraid for myself and knew every moment counted if I was going to escape across the border. But it had been so long since I had spoken to someone who wasn’t trying to hurt me. Maybe that is why I stayed. 

That decision would lead to more deaths than I ever wanted to be responsible for. 

“Listen hun, I knew that man there. He was no good. And you will find a lot of people around these parts would agree. So if you stand your ground and give a statement, I am sure it will all work out. But if you run, everyone will think you are guilty. You are not a runner, are ye?” 

I shook her arm off me. “Call the police and I will be back,” I growled over my shoulder. Kathy squeaked and stepped away. There wasn’t anger in her eyes. Only hurt. 

Powerful winds tore at my hair and face, carrying the sound of rapidly approaching sirens with it. I stumbled through the knee deep snow, desperately trying to reach the tree line that would take me over the border. I was so weak, my body’s reserves fading rapidly. But freedom was so close! I could nearly touch it. I just had to push a bit harder…

“STOP,” blared an artificially boosted voice. I turned and saw several snowmobiles rapidly gaining on me. 

I surprised myself when I started to ask Kali to take over. I was completely spent, left to crawl on my hands and knees through mud and snow uphill. She did not deign to reply. Her presence merely watched, excited at the violence to come. 

It never did. I collapsed right at the edge of the Canadian border. The last thing I remembered before drifting into a warm deep sleep was a sense of gratitude at finally being able to rest. ",4,1749445995.0,nosleep,0,0.83,False

19:00 kicked out of room for the venue to change to dance floor. (Is 30 minutes enough for dessert?) during this time outside we were going to cut and serve cake, and have tea and coffee. I’m unsure about having it in a standing set up… could be awkward for people to manage it all?? 
19:30 back in to the room where the grazing board for evening food will be set up. Followed by first dance and that whole part of the night

18:30 dessert served 
19:00 cake cut and then kicked out of room for the venue to change to dance floor. 
19:30 back in to the room for cake, tea, and coffee to be served, followed by our first dance that may be closer to 20:00, and the grazing board for evening food will be set up. 

Concerns: 
Is it weird to pause people that may already be dancing to announce our first dance? 
I’m aware the risk of going outside could mean losing people who will stay outside for longer than 30 minutes which could disrupt the “vibe” of the dance floor/spreads the party around. We have no alternative, but Any tips on how to maintain this/avoid it getting spread too thinly? 
Is serving cake/having cake slices available where the grazing board will be set up (once it has been served)… weird? 

Thanks in advance ❤️

**Why This Pick?**

Okay, hear me out – the Pirates are fresh off of sweeping the Phillies, and Mike Burrows’ last outing was shockingly solid at 0 runs allowed (facing the Astros). Burrows is currently sitting at 1-1 (1 logged win, 1 loss…), and while 0 earned runs might not be the norm, the Pirates also found success against the Diamondbacks in Burrows’ start prior to their encounter with Houston in which he allowed 4 to cross home plate. I've had my doubts about the Pirates, but let’s be honest – the Marlins aren’t blowing anybody’s hair back these days having lost 6 of their last 7 games. My money’s on Pittsburgh to bag a win at home.

- I am very passionate about books, having read a total of 93 books  this year.

Here’s what I’m not into:
I am not interested in video games. While you can play them and talk to me about it, I’m not going to know what you’re talking about. Unless we meet in person and you can show me how to play sometime, it probably won’t work if you are a hardcore gamer.

- I don’t care about hunting, fishing, or camping. My motto is, ""My idea of camping is a hotel with room service."" I love taking walks, though; I prefer to come home after two hours and live my life.",1,1749445720.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

The most information I’ve found is that it’s a style from the 70s, and most that I find that are similar are in the $700-1200 range, and of course with newer looking remakes. I’m not seeing any in this color so I’m curious what anyone with an ounce of knowledge on antiques might expect this set to value at, or what to call it so I can research further?

she likes this guy, let's call him J, a lot, but she's unsure if he likes her back

**Nice things J has done:**

* J consistently looks at her when they’re in a group, even when she’s not talking. He observes her reactions.
* He walked her home on her first night at her new apartment, even though it was out of his way.
* He helped her find and move into her apartment, driving her back and forth to the real estate office and helping with all the related errands. He also translated the lease for her since she’s a foreigner and doesn’t speak the local language well, and used his car to move her stuff.
* He changed his profile picture for the first time in forever to a photo she took of him and called it the best picture he has.
* He cut her steak during a meal when she just offered him a bite. When a friend pointed out that he’s too nice to her and that’s why she thinks he likes her, J just laughed and pretended to cut his friend’s rice. He asked who else thought that.
* J pays attention to things she likes or doesn’t like and proudly points out that he remembers whenever it’s brought up.
* When his friends teased him about a wet spot on his pants and she played along, J got panicked and defensive. He’s done that a lot lately, becoming more worried about her misinterpreting things about him.
* J and she were walking back to the office when another guy approached and asked to talk to her alone. J just left to go to his desk. The guy then asked for her number, saying he always sees her around. After the guy left, she saw J at his desk with his headphones on, half off his ears, as if he wasn’t listening to anything. When she asked why he left her and told him the guy made her uncomfortable, J’s face looked shocked and shaky, almost like he was surprised and scared, similar to how she looks when her heart drops. He had no clue. He then called the guy creepy and went outside to look for him and see if he was still around. When they walked back in, J said, “Wow, you’re so popular,” and as he was heading back to his desk, he bumped into the partition and dropped his umbrella. They both laughed about it across the room.
* When J’s friends were hyping him up about his body, he pretended to lift his shirt up, looked at her, smiled, and tilted his head, almost asking, “Should I?/Do you want to see?”

**J’s friends seem to be in on it:**

* One friend made space for J to sit next to her, standing outside the booth until J came to sit beside her, even though his friend, who is also her friend, could’ve sat next to her instead. That same friend also makes her sit in the passenger seat when J is driving.
* Another friend left them alone, smiling, while they were talking, even though he had just sat down.
* His friend complained to her, in front of J, about how J tends to space out his relationships by a year. His last relationship ended almost 5–6 months ago. The friend then asked her if that made sense.
* Once, J only asked her to lunch with his close friend, even though there were others in the office. His close friend pointed that out too.

**Signs J may not like her:**

* He’s deflected her invitation to walk by the river twice. The first time, he was hungover and sick. The second time, he said he had work, even though he expressed wanting to go to the beach with everyone (but they refused because it was finals week and the beach was far—though, to be honest, he wasn’t serious about it either).
* J asked her why she liked the river, and when she asked why he doesn’t, he said the river isn’t special to him because he’s lived nearby for 30 years—but didn’t suggest an alternative way to spend time together.
* He showed no visible jealousy when the other guy asked to talk to her alone. He only commented after the fact and acted like he had no clue what the guy was up to.
* J has never followed up on his own invitations or taken the initiative to spend one-on-one time with her, except for twice—once for dinner when everyone else was busy, and another time to grab coffee.
* he’s nice to everyone",1,1749445334.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False
1l6wc4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/NursingUK/comments/1l6wc4r/end_of_placement_gift_whats_appropriate/,End of placement gift . What’s  appropriate?,"Hi everyone! 

I’m a 2nd year student nurse and I’m about to finish a lovely placement , honestly one of the best I’ve had so far. For the first time ever, I actually feel like I want to give something back to say thank you, and I’d really appreciate a bit of advice!

I’ve seen other students leave things like cupcakes, donuts, sweets and a card for the ward team in the staff kitchen as a general thank-you, and I’d love to do something like that just a nice gesture for the nurses, HCAs, and everyone who’s been so kind and welcoming.

But I also want to do something a bit more personal for my supervisor. She’s been absolutely amazing throughout, supportive, patient, kind, and genuinely invested in helping me learn and grow. I was thinking of writing her a personal card and maybe putting a small gift card inside (like a coffee shop one or something similar). Would that be appropriate, or is that a bit much?

Also, I’m a bit unsure because I don’t really feel the same toward my assessor. I did work with her and she was pleasant, but we didn’t really connect the same way. I had more shifts with my supervisor and built more of a relationship there. Would it be weird or rude if I only gave a personal thank-you to my supervisor and not my assessor? I don’t want to seem ungrateful, but I also want it to feel genuine.

I'm scared he will have feelings of giving up completely soon. I really want to show him that there are still sparks of hope for feeling better.

Let me list some of his biggest ailments we've been trying to treat: first and foremost is severe unbearable back pain, all along the spine but most especially in the neck and lower back. He is almost always facing the floor due to not being able to raise his neck and his spine is always in a C shape. Due to this he's not very mobile but he does still use walkers, just not without pain.

Extremely overactive bladder.. just one sip of water makes him feel like he needs to pee. He's very frustrated with this because trips to the bathroom mean putting pressure on his aching back even more. He's also been dealing with hemorrhoids that make sitting painful.

And diet has also been a problem. He has no appetite almost all of the time, and lately has been losing weight like crazy (lost 11 pounds in last 30 days). He's diabetic so i have to make him special meals, but its hard for him to give up on things like coffee, soda, and salsa which he always loved. I don't have the heart to take away the only things he looks forward to..

There's several other things I could list but those have been the biggest hurdles right now. I've been doing everything I can to treat these things for years. We've done medications, physical therapy and acupuncture for his back, I massage him every day and apply pain relief creams.. it only helps so much. 

Any ideas on what more I can do. I want to give him hope again.",1,1749445228.0,CaregiverSupport,0,1.0,False

I’m starting my first shot tomorrow and have been reading through this sub for months now and I know the things I’m asking have been asked hundreds of times but just hoping maybe someone will come in with a new suggestion!
Just for info: I am 5’2 and 240 pounds

So first off, I am reallllly stressed about eating. I hate cooking and only can cook very basic things. I know I will learn but for starters I need some simple meal ideas. Usual dinners consist of spaghetti, chicken Alfredo, crack chicken, tacos, burgers, and I have Buldak carbonara at least once a week. There’s usually fast food in the mix 1-2 times a week as well. 

I generally don’t eat breakfast but if I do it’s a fried egg with wheat toast and mayo. Sometimes bacon or sausage. Every morning I have a coffee with a protein shake it in though. 

Lunch is usually nothing. Maybe a tuna salad or chicken salad sandwich(on wheat) if I feel like making it. Or chips or cookies. Then eat whatever snacks when I am hungry throughout the day. 

My suggested calories is like 2200ish and I honestly don’t think I can eat that much… or afford it tbh lol though I haven’t tracked my eating habits in years so idk. 

Other question- I am gonna call the help line tomorrow, but last Monday I pulled my first pen out to take it and I chickened out. I had the pen out of the fridge for a few hours before deciding not to start. I was just going to leave it at room temp but our house gets super hot (no central air) so I put it back in the fridge after being out for several hours. Is that safe?

Lastly any other tips would be appreciated!

I told the psych I wanted to get off of it and she was like ok do you want to try something else and I said no. So she titrated me off 30mg in 2-3 weeks I believe. So 20mg week 1, and 10mg the week after. Or maybe it was 2 weeks per dosage decrease. But either way it seemed a bit fast given I was on it for 6 months. I’m thinking after the last 10mg, if I could have taken even smaller doses of it to ease the titration period even more. Like going to a compounding clinic or getting a liquid version. Anyways, 1-2 months after getting off of it, I experienced severe cognitive impairments. I got off of it in Nov 2023, I started experiencing these changes January 2024. For a period of 4 months from January to April 2024, I felt extremely wired. Super stressed and worried all the time to the point I think the stress damaged my brain. I was scared to drink coffee bc the coffee set me over the edge even more. It was a constant state of feeling energized but in the wrong way, like I didn’t have a chance to stop and catch a breath. Then I hit a depression in the summer months from May-July-ish. 

Since then, my brain hasn’t felt the same, or performed the same. I described it to my doctor as issues with executive functioning (making outlines, organization, reasoning, prioritization…) I was also recently diagnosed with Bipolar and it’s known that SSRI’s have high chances of causing mania in individuals with Bipolar. I’ve also read some articles about ssri anti-depressant discontinuation syndrome causing mania. 

All this to say, has anyone experienced what I’m describing? I’m not sure if this so-called impairment is from getting off of Prozac too fast and/or triggered mania.",1,1749445031.0,prozac,1,1.0,False

I'm likely going to write down notes about it as usual for my own records when I read it, so the only difference would be whether I summarise those notes and post it or not.



Anyway, I'm glad they're trying different types of mini-games in the character story. I'm not a big fan of the map puzzle ones like Melania's, Shamane's, Tuesday's, etc. Recoleta's basically a memory game and I find it easier than those lol.



I missed the 'y' in the stylised title and only realised it was there when I read the manuscript's title at the end lol. Anyway, onto the summary.



\-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.



Thomas, an aspiring writer, met up with his editor, Hunting, and handed her a booklet that he said was given to him by a girl working at a coffee shop. It was a story about a coachman, a cowboy, an old man and a cowhand. He insisted she gave it a read because he thought it was unique, and after reading it, Hunting asked him to find the girl and bring her to her. The girl turned out to be Recoleta who was handing out her work for free in hopes of catching the right person's attention and was pleased to know it worked. She thought Hunting was about to offer her a publishing deal but Hunting started criticising the work instead. They discussed it well into the night and Hunting posed some questions to her to think through as a basis for revision. Recoleta promised to come back with a reworked version in a week, and Hunting was surprised when Recoleta did come back in a week with a revised version. It was the last appointment of the day and as Recoleta started reading her story to Hunting, she fell asleep and found herself in an unfamiliar place together with Recoleta, who said they had now become the protagonists of the story. Hunting wanted to leave but Recoleta said it would be a pity to cut their tale short, so Hunting played along and gave her advice on how to use a Macguffin to advance the story. In the office, Recoleta woke Hunting up and thanked her for the advice. She wanted to continue the discussion but Hunting wanted to leave as it was quite late, so she offered for Recoleta to come visit her home so they could keep discussing the work the next day.



As they continued their discussion, the two found themselves in the story's world again, meeting the crows who were ghosts of the old man and cowhand. The old man said they could reach the core of the temple they were in if they could solve the cowhand's riddle and the cowhand simply said his cow could take them there. Hunting asked what the tie was between the cow and the theme of her story and Recoleta said the cow represented literature that didn't offer answers but rather raised questions for discussions. As they rode the cow up towards the core, Hunting kept editing her work. Inspired by Recoleta's love and optimism about literature, Hunting was reminded of her own love for literature and agreed to help Recoleta work on the novel until it was completed. On their next session, Hunting said that the literature era Recoleta kept talking about had already been long gone. Recoleta likened the peak to an earthquake and said that while she had missed it, she could still feel the distant tremors. Hunting said she understood her feeling and that was why she kept pushing Recoleta to write something great.



Over the next couple of months, they kept talking about Recoleta's novel and Hunting came up with a sudden idea of turning the novel into a trilogy. Recoleta didn't agree immediately because she found it difficult to structure the trilogy and she still hadn't figured out the ending of the novel yet. Hunting came up with a suggestion of how to turn the ending into a mystery that would lead to the next story, where the coachman and cowboy came upon their own skeletons, leading to a bigger mystery of endless cycle of life and death. Since then, Recoleta had missed their afternoon meetings as she struggled with the ending of the first novel and with ideas for the next ones. She visited the cafe where she used to work and asked an ex-coworker to read through her manuscript. He was reluctant at first because he thought it would be filled with metaphors he couldn't understand, but at her reassurance, he gave it a read. He was excited about the bigger mystery hinted at the ending but Recoleta was still doubtful. He told her not to be too focused on the work itself that she forgot why she started writing in the first place. That night, she dreamed of being trapped in a forest labyrinth called the 'Labyrinth of Symbols', a reflection of her inner world.



Hunting and the publishing house director were caught in a tense discussion because their publishing house hadn't published any bestseller in a while. After he left, Recoleta came in with the manuscript for her second work, called 'The Symbolic Forest'. Hunting was happy to see her again, but after reading it, quickly became critical of it, saying the story was too self-indulgent and that Recoleta kept making the same mistakes she already pointed out in the first work. Devastated, Recoleta took her manuscript and ran out of the office. As she was despairing, she found herself transported to the story's world again and met with Gaucho Rider, a version of herself that stayed in the realm of fiction when she decided to return to reality. Gaucho Rider asked her to come along on her adventure to find the Ruinas Gloriosas. Recoleta asked how she was sure she would find the ruins and Gaucho Rider showed her a badge of honour. Gaucho Rider said there was no award ceremony when she received it and there wasn't official honour in it, but it was still an irreplaceable symbol as it was an undeniable proof to her that she would find the ruins. Recoleta finally agreed to come along, saying failure didn't diminish the glory of the journey and that her novel would become her own badge of honour.



Recoleta came back to Hunting's office to drop off a letter. Hunting happened to be there and told Recoleta that a thank you or sorry should be said in person. She read Recoleta's letter and the both of them apologised to each other. Hunting understood Recoleta's decision to give up on publishing her novel and admitted she was worried she was trying to influence Recoleta's work too much and questioned whether the first version was already the best. She said when she graduated from her literary course, she decided to become an editor because there were many poets and writers but not enough editors. Recoleta then asked if Hunting would help her finish her second novel, not as writer and editor, but as friends and literary companions. Hunting agreed. Recoleta found herself at the desert again and Gaucho Rider told her to continue the journey, find the Ruinas Gloriosas, and save their comrade, which Recoleta assumed was Hunting. She followed the steps written out in the story to find the ruins, and at the heart of the ruins, managed to defeat the phantoms and save Hunting with Hunting's aid. She then asked Hunting if their story was completed, and said goodbye as she decided to leave and live a free life.



A year later, Hunting was giving Thomas advice on his manuscript when he asked why she decided to leave her well-paying job and start her own publishing house. She didn't give him a straight answer but said it had something to do with him. An employee came into her office to drop off a manuscript they received in the mail, and Hunting was it was a manuscript by Recoleta.

The closest I had to an 'editor' was a beta-reader when I used to join fandom writing fests. Most of my beta-readers focused only on spelling and vocabulary, though, so I wonder how it'd feel like to be guided by an editor.



Man, there's so many relatable things in this lol. Readers who tried to dictate the direction of my stories made me quit writing once and were why, just like Recoleta, I decided to not pursue traditional publishing or making writing a job. Self-indulgence is the reason why I mostly write things that stay in my hard drive only and for my eyes only. And I'm sure a lot of writers are familiar with those times when your characters seemingly come to life and let you write their story. I've had so many instances where I think ""I didn't plan for this"" but my fingers just kept typing as the characters kept moving the story forward, interacting with each other and the situations the way they would.



For me, starting and ending a story is always the hardest, so I can relate with Recoleta (and I'm sure many writers can also relate with that ""just write!""). You need to hook the readers with the start, and the ending has to be at a good, satisfying point. I don't know how many times I've re-written endings because I wanted to add or remove some things and it just doesn't work lol. I haven't written a proper story in a while, though, so I'm sure I've gotten rusty.",5,1749444718.0,Reverse1999,0,0.86,False

After covid he flew back town and invited me to open a business which ultimately failed. However he saw an opportunity in a basic business. Let's just say it is a business in coffee, tea, ice cream, bread, something you see and easily you can get anywhere.

I ended up going back to office while he started this business. He simply replicates another store just changed the recipe and logo. He got some hardship when opening, i lent him some money and he payed it back. Happy for his success, truly.

1 and a half year passed. Here i am still stuck on office while he is up to his 4th store. Thinking now, i felt like i can just open the same business, simply change the recipe and logo.

Talked to him and turned out he thought it is not ethic. We had a conversation, basically my point of view is, it is not a proprietary business, it wans't a tech business or something hard. It is just a normal business like tea, coffee, fruits, etc. He also replicate another business. But now i tried to get into the space, i understand we will become competitor as we are sharing the same marketplace.  But i also long to be a successfull person.

Recently i was talking with my sister and she said, try networking and coffee-meet up to build networking to find jobs. Now I have my fair share of job struggles here and from what i have seen, these things works for IT but not for traditional fields like mine. Happy to be proven wrong if somebody has any experience in this. I have tried to network and do coffee meet ups in the past but people are not really interested in meeting and networking.

1) If the thing I mentioned works, how to do it? I know it's a numbers game not many people will say. So please guide me if you have experienced this.

2) If the above methode doesn't work, wht else can be done to make all of this process a bit bearable this time?

Just to give a background as to where I am coming from: I studied masters here in business field and It took me 1 whole year to get an internship (german speaking) in a different field than my experience and then once I graduated it took almost 6 motnhs to find the current job. So I have experienced normally how things usually work here but I know, there might be people who might have experienced totally differently. 

I am open to both english as well as Geeman speaking jobs in my current field (working on german with full gas rn) but prefers to be in German speaking one as it has been a better experience so far.

Long time lurker, first time posting here. I wanted to write this to pay it forward because I loved reading people's success stories and wished more people would come back and write about their good experiences. I hope this post gives someone hope or clarity!

  
**Getting a diagnosis**

I was someone subjected to medical gaslighting for two years. I saw 4 GI doctors who all thought I was a crazy lady with regular old IBS. They didn't want to listen to me, even after I ended up in the ER for pain. I ended up ignoring the issue for about a year because no one cared to help me. I remember having ER level pain at home and just... sucking it up because I didn't think there was anything wrong with me. (Also, I am a 29F if that helps anyone for context).

My symptoms got steadily worse for two years and included nightly stomach pains and nausea, inability to eat anything with fat or fiber, chronic constipation (weird yes), heartburn with a bitter taste in my throat, gagging, bloating, low energy, occasional disorientation and the shakes, and rapid weight loss. (About 30 pounds in 4 months towards the end.)

You would think that would have all been a red flag to my GI docs, but I had to research everything myself. I decided on my own it could be my gallbladder, thanks to this sub and some friends of mine who had theirs out. I'm so glad I finally put my foot down and demanded a HIDA scan, which came back with a 25% EF. I was so elated to finally have a test come back not normal!! I was diagnosed with biliary dyskinesia without gallstones.

**Deciding to have surgery**

I scheduled an appointment with a general surgeon with stellar reviews and they suggested I yeet the dang organ. I was a little nervous, it is a big deal to take out an organ after all, but they listened to me explain the daily struggle and assured me that I would most likely have a huge improvement to my quality of life. They also told me that if I ever want to have kids in the future, most likely I would end up in the ER for emergency surgery while pregnant. Apparently pregnancy hormones can further aggravate gallbladder issues, especially if you already have a known condition. I decided it was worth the risk and booked the surgery.

**Post op recovery**

The surgery went really well! It was done laparoscopically and I healed fairly quickly and easily. I had to remind a few people that I had just had an organ ripped out of me through my belly button a few times, but other than that, I did better and better each week! Go easy on yourself the first 2 weeks, because holy crap. You may think you're good but man, abdominal surgery is not a joke! (I went back to work 12 days after my removal, and I had to take it reallllly slow. I probably should have stayed home a bit longer, but bills am I right?)

After continuing my low fat/low fiber diet for a few weeks after surgery, I slowly started reintroducing my favorite foods. It was really scary at first, because before I got my gallbladder yeeted, I would be in so much pain after just a little bit of ice cream, or a scoop of guacamole. But I slowly increased my fat intake from 10 grams of fat a day, to 20, to 30, and now... I can eat whatever I want. It is amazing!!! I just had to listen to my body. Sometimes I would try a food and have horrible heartburn and nausea, so I would avoid it for a week or so and then try it again later. The last food I just reintroduced was coffee, and boy I've missed it. It was touch and go for a few weeks, but now I can drink a cup a day again! I can also do one glass of alcohol, but again, I have to pay attention to my body.

**Results at 10 weeks**

I am 10 weeks post op, and I can't even tell you how much better I feel. Virtually all of my original symptoms are GONE. I sometimes have heartburn when I am being extra crazy with my dietary choices, but other than that, having my gallbladder removed was a decision I would make again and again. I was a shell of a person before, and I was losing weight so fast I felt like I was dying. I looked sick, and I felt sick. I was in pain daily. Now, my weight has stabilized, my chronic constipation is gone, and I have energy again. 

Also, I've lost a TON of hair since having the surgery, and my hairdresser assures me that's normal about three months after a traumatic event, and it will grow back, haha. 

If you relate to any part of my journey, I hope it helps. It was worth it to me to get my gallbladder removed. I hope you all find the answers you seek and relief from your symptoms. Much love! Feel free to leave any questions below.",5,1749444042.0,gallbladders,10,1.0,False
1l6w07c,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1l6w07c/chapter_ten_the_concealed_demerit_slip/,Chapter Ten – The Concealed Demerit Slip,"From *""The Bad Student Liked by the Dean of Student Affairs""*

Zhang Yingfang saw that I wasn’t answering, so he stood up from the sofa and walked step by step back to his desk. He pulled out a demerit slip from the pile of documents and let out a long sigh.

""Be honest... Did you cheat?""

After much hesitation, I decided to tell Zhang Yingfang the truth.

""Yes! I cheated! Can you just record the demerit already?""

Zhang Yingfang’s expression turned terrifying, his face twisted as he glared at me. His fangs bared in anger, looking exactly like a menacing wolf ready to strike.

""Do you know how serious the consequences of this are? If you hadn’t been caught, maybe it wouldn’t matter—but once you’re caught, it’s a major demerit! And the test gets a zero. In serious cases, it could even lead to expulsion. Do you understand that?""

This was the first time I’d ever seen Zhang Yingfang truly angry. He was like a different person—completely unlike the image of a director. Describing him as a beast wouldn’t be an exaggeration.

""Wu! You’re not a kid anymore. You need to start taking responsibility for your actions. Stop acting like some junior high brat—getting into trouble, crying, causing chaos!""

Zhang Yingfang’s voice grew louder and louder as he stepped toward me, finally throwing the demerit slip hard at my chest.

""Not studying is not studying. Don’t think cheating will get you results that aren’t yours. Even if you score high, so what? Do you even know how to answer the questions on the test? Can you cheat during the national joint exams? I know Zhiwei cares a lot about your grades, but that doesn’t mean you can lie to your father like this.""

I picked up the demerit slip that had fallen to the side and read the contents carefully.

""This was... filed by the homeroom teacher?""

I was so shocked I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t believe it was the homeroom teacher who reported me.

""Yeah... The whole class hates you. The homeroom teacher targets you. Who would like a ticking time bomb who causes trouble for no reason?""

""Shut up! Just sign the damn slip and be done with it! Why go off on this moralizing lecture? Don’t you get thirsty from talking so much? I’m tired of listening.""

Furious, I pulled out my bayonet and hurled it at him.

The bayonet tore through his black suit and struck the floor. A ten-centimeter gash appeared on Zhang Yingfang’s hand. He held the wound in pain, gritting his teeth and trying to stay composed.

""Heh... The scar on my neck from last time hasn’t even faded, and now you’re adding another one.""

He unbuttoned his shirt, touched the scar on his neck with his bloodied left hand, and looked at me strangely.

""Look, Bai Feng\~ These are all your masterpieces!""

""This time, there’s no Zhang Lingjia to save you!""

With that, I rushed toward the bayonet, aiming to land a fatal blow on Zhang Yingfang! But he kicked me hard in the stomach, sending both me and the bayonet crashing back onto the sofa. The pain left me unable to open my eyes.

""A mere bayonet won’t be enough to hurt me. Even without Lingjia, I can handle a little brat like you.""

Zhang Yingfang spoke as he approached the sofa, tearing the sleeve from his suit jacket to casually tie it around his wound. He smiled slyly at me, his blood-covered hands braced on the coffee table, his eyes reflecting unyielding determination.

“Zhang Yingfang... Is this the outcome you wanted? None of this would’ve happened if you’d just signed the slip...”

“I will never give up on any student! That includes you! Stop saying those useless, pathetic things. If I haven’t given up on you, then you’re not allowed to give up on yourself either.”

Zhang Yingfang struggled to walk over to my side and collapsed heavily onto the sofa.

Gradually, I calmed down too. I turned to look at the wound still seeping blood, my heart full of guilt. I wanted to apologize, but I couldn’t bring myself to say the words.

Suddenly! Zhang Yingfang stood up from the sofa, reached under the coffee table, and pulled open a drawer. Inside were all sorts of cups and tea sets—plastic, ceramic, all kinds of materials imaginable. If you could think of it, he had it.

“Bai Feng! Want some coffee?”

This guy’s mood swings are way too extreme! Just a second ago we were having a bloody battle over cheating, and now he’s grinning like a fool asking me if I want coffee? I really can’t figure out how Zhang Yingfang’s mind works.

Seeing that I still hadn’t answered, Zhang Yingfang leaned in, his bloody hand reaching out to gently stroke my hair. A faint fragrance wafted from the wound—an oddly enticing scent that stirred a desire to conquer.

“Eh? Gone dumb? Why aren’t you answering?”

“S-sure…”

What the hell was that?! What kind of answer did I just give?! That’s way too shameless… It’s not like my family is so poor we can’t afford coffee at home. Why didn’t I just wait till I got back?!

Zhang Yingfang took a wet wipe from the drawer and wiped the blood off his hand. Then he pulled out two mugs, walked over to the water dispenser, washed the mugs and the glass pot used for brewing, carefully placed the filter paper in the dripper, scooped out the coffee beans, poured them into the grinder, and gently turned the handle. The scent of coffee wafted through every corner of the Student Affairs Office.

He poured the ground coffee into the filter, filled the gooseneck kettle with hot water, confirmed the temperature, then began pouring slowly—circle after circle over the coffee grounds. The entire office was soon filled with the comforting and relaxing aroma of coffee.

Zhang Yingfang returned with the coffee, gently poured it into the mugs, and handed one to me.

“Young Master Wu! Hand-brewed with care, please enjoy.”

In that moment, I saw a shadow of Mr. Hong in Zhang Yingfang—that... persistent misunderstanding of devotion.

The mug in my hand gradually changed color, revealing a cute anime character. My thoughts drifted along with the color-changing mug…

Zhang Yingfang... You’re just like the design on this mug. Unless hot water is poured in, the pattern won’t appear. Normally, no one can tell there’s anything there... You keep doing things I can’t make sense of. I’m such a terrible person, yet you insist on saving me—even getting hurt in the process. Is it really worth it? All the things you’ve done... they’re like the hidden pattern on this cup—no matter how much you do, no one will notice.

“What’s wrong? Is the coffee not to your liking? Or… have you never seen a color-changing mug before?”

“That’s not it… I was just thinking about stuff…”

“Thinking about why the cup changes color?”

Zhang Yingfang slapped his thigh and laughed, like he couldn’t feel the pain in his injured hand at all.

""How can you still laugh? Aren’t you angry? Don’t you hate me?""

Zhang Yingfang picked up his coffee and took a big gulp, letting the steam rise across his face.

""Why should I be angry? Why should I hate you? As the Director of Student Affairs, I don’t have such a petty heart.""

He gently blew on the coffee in his cup, watching the ripples spread out one circle after another. For a moment, I didn’t know how to respond.

""Aiya\~ Got a cat’s tongue, huh? You’ve blown on it so many times and still don’t dare take a sip.""

""Mm! I’m really afraid of hot stuff.""

Zhang Yingfang took the coffee from my hand and blew on it lightly. The steam instantly dissipated, and the temperature of the mug noticeably dropped.

""There! It’s cooled down. Give it a try.""

Are you kidding me?! You think I’m a child? Like it’s possible for one puff of air to actually cool it down? Do I look like some brainless second-gen official to you?

I reached out and took the coffee. To my surprise, the mug wasn’t hot at all. Could it be that Zhang Yingfang actually has some kind of superpower? I suspiciously took a sip—and as expected, burned my tongue. I immediately spat the coffee all over Zhang Yingfang’s face.

""S-sorry! Director... I, uh...""

""It’s fine! It’s fine!""

I quickly set the mug down on the coffee table, grabbed some tissues nearby, and carefully wiped the coffee off his face—taking the opportunity to admire his handsome features up close.

""Why are you staring at me like that? Did my looks mesmerize you?""

""As if! You’re not even my type.""

""But… your pupils dilated\~ Isn’t that just you wanting a clearer look?""

Zhang Yingfang spoke in a flirty tone, closing his eyes in enjoyment as he casually ran his fingers through his long hair.

""Mm...""

Zhang Yingfang let out a strange moan, his cheeks flushing red. He squinted at me, then shyly pushed my hand away.

""What’s wrong?""

""It hurts...""

I opened the tissue in my hand and was shocked speechless.

Inside was a small earring stud—gold with a diamond inlaid in the post. One glance was enough to know it was expensive.

""Uh... Sorry about that! I’ll just put it back for you.""

""No need! I’ll do it myself.""

He snatched the earring, stood up, walked to the mirror on the wall, and carefully put it back in. Then he picked up the coffee on the table, gave it a shake, and drank it down.

As I lowered my head to pick up my own coffee, I realized—the mug was gone! The coffee that had been on the coffee table had disappeared! The other cup was empty… could it be...

I looked up at Zhang Yingfang, and a bad feeling surged in my chest.

""Director! Don’t tell me the coffee you drank was mine…""

At that moment, Zhang Yingfang realized something was wrong. He hurriedly set the mug down and covered his mouth with both hands.

""Bai Feng… I didn’t do it on purpose! I, uh…""

""Ooh\~ If you like me, just say it\~ No need for sneaky little tricks. You’re so childish.""

I joked and teased Zhang Yingfang. Seeing his nervous expression, I couldn’t help but laugh.

""Yeah! I like you! Got a problem with that?""

The sudden confession caught me off guard. I couldn’t tell if Zhang Yingfang was serious or just joking. I had no idea how to respond.

Zhang Yingfang’s cheeks were as red as peaches. He walked toward me with a solemn expression.

""I just care about you too much. I can’t stand seeing you get hurt. I try to take care of you, thinking ahead and behind. Didn’t you feel anything at all?""

Zhang Yingfang reached out and lifted my chin, gazing at me affectionately, as if I could hear his heartbeat.

""Every day, I fantasize... fantasize that one day you’ll like me. But it’s been almost a year now...""

Zhang Yingfang looked shy, his lips trembling nonstop.

""Bai Feng... Just once... Just once is enough...""

What do you mean just once?! Say it clearly! Don’t say things that can be easily misunderstood!

Zhang Yingfang gently swept aside his blood-streaked hair and brushed his lips against my neck.

""Zhang Yingfang… you’d better cut it out—""

Before I could finish, he kissed me. His cold tongue writhed in my mouth, the tip brushing against his sharp canine teeth. The wet, sticky sensation was suffocating, as if he was draining the air from my lungs, ready to swallow me whole.

Zhang Yingfang’s arms tightened around me, leaving me no space to struggle. My body could only yield to his control...

Never in my life did I imagine that my first kiss would be stolen by a man—let alone the Dean of Student Affairs. If people heard about this, they’d surely think I had some kind of sexual confusion. Even my father would see me as bringing shame to the family.

""Bai Feng... promise me...""

""Promise you what?! A whole Director of Student Affairs making out with a student in the Student Affairs Office—do you know how awful that would sound if word got out?""

It seemed like Zhang Yingfang didn’t hear a word I said. He tore open my collar and kissed me again. His hand quietly slipped under my uniform, restlessly sliding along my back, then over my waist, and up to my chest—deftly unbuttoning the front of my shirt.

Just then, I heard hurried footsteps. They were getting closer and closer.

Suddenly!

""Xiao Hei! I heard from Teacher Tingzi that you were handling a cheating incident, so I—""

The person who opened the door was none other than Zhang Lingjia. The air instantly filled with awkward tension. Even if I jumped into the Yellow River, I couldn’t wash this clean. No matter how I explained, no one would believe me. If I said I was here over a demerit slip, only a fool would buy that!

""Ling! Don’t you know how to knock before coming in? Where are your manners? What have I always taught you?""

""Tch! How was I supposed to know you were ‘handling business’ in here?! If I’d known, I would’ve brought the bed along too. I seriously doubt that hard, narrow sofa is comfortable to ‘do it’ on.""

Zhang Lingjia crossed his arms and stared at the two of us, a weird smile on his face…

I quickly wriggled out of Zhang Yingfang’s grip, straightened my terrible posture, stood up, and buttoned my uniform.

""Aiya\~ This guy looks kind of familiar\~ You’re... Wu Bai Feng, right?""

Zhang Lingjia scratched his head, staring at me with a puzzled look.

""Aren’t you the one who… secretly looked at Xiao Hei’s photo in the library?""

""You looked at my photo?""

Zhang Yingfang gave me a confused look. It seemed like he wanted to say something, but stopped just short of speaking.

""Brother Feng was totally focused\~ He looked like he wanted to cut the photo out of the yearbook and keep it for himself.""

Zhang Lingjia, shut up! Can you say less, please? You’re only making everything sound worse! If Zhang Yingfang thinks I’m some kind of pervert after this, I won’t survive in this school! And also—who gave you permission to give me a nickname?! Did I, this young master, ever approve?!

Zhang Lingjia continued saying weird things as he slowly walked toward me. He reached out, grabbed my collar, and tilted his head to look at my neck.

""This is… Xiao Hei’s kiss mark, huh?""

I nodded like a bobblehead, hoping they’d hurry and let me leave the Student Affairs Office. If I stayed any longer, something bad was bound to happen.

""Xiao Hei! Don’t you think you went a bit overboard? Just look at how deep that hickey is on his neck—and his back’s full of scratch marks. If someone doesn’t want to do it, don’t force them.""

Hearing Zhang Lingjia say that, I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry! It kind of made sense… but something about it still felt totally wrong.

Zhang Yingfang stood up, straightened his clothes, picked up the necktie from the side and tied it on, then glanced at the demerit slip on the coffee table—and made a shocking decision. He shoved the slip into the shredder, pretending nothing had happened, then picked up the documents on his desk and resumed working.

""Director! I’m heading out now! Baise called and is rushing me.""

With that, I hurried toward the school gate. Otherwise, Mr. Bai would be upset again.

On the way, I fixed my uniform, trying my best to smooth out the wrinkles and use the collar to cover the hickey.

""Young Master Wu! Just how many times have you made me wait now?""

""Don’t ask… I got caught cheating.""

Mr. Bai’s flirtatious look instantly turned into horror. He quickly asked for the full story.

""This is bad... I’ll try to come up with a plan later. Under no circumstances can the master find out.""

""I don’t think Zhang Yingfang plans to do anything about it. He just gave me a lecture and let me go.""

That’s right! There’s no way I could tell him I’d just gotten into a fight with Zhang Yingfang in the Student Affairs Office and rolled all over the sofa. I could only say I was held back for cheating...

That night, while showering, I looked at the hickey on my neck and felt a sudden wave of disgust. No matter how hard I scrubbed, it wouldn’t come off. Even the bloodstains in my hair seemed like they had grown from the roots themselves. I used up an entire bottle of shampoo, but the color still wouldn’t fade.

I used my bathrobe to cover the kiss mark on my neck, dove under the blanket, and forced myself not to think about what had happened.

This had to be a nightmare. Once I sleep it off, it’ll be gone…

I live an hour north of the city, so last week I reserved parking via the SpotHero app at the Westin Hotel. Got parked a little after 9am, grabbed a coffee in the lobby and walked over to the Nintendo Store. There were about 40 people in line at that time. By 9:30am there were probably 3 times as many people who showed up. 

Around 9:45am, the employees started to move their way down the line, scanning and counting warp passes. Right before the store opened at 10am, employees began handing out menus with all Switch 2 products and a pen to write our names and check off which console/accessories we planned on purchasing. They also gave us wristbands (which they cut off at checkout). Once inside, employees came up to us and took our papers to collect our items from “upstairs” and it would be ready for us at the checkout counter. 

Purchased my console first then continued to shop. They eventually opened up the bottom floor register where I purchased my other goodies!

From what I saw, everyone who had a warp pass was able to purchase a console. Probably one of the smoother console experiences. 

Shoutout to the amazing, helpful and friendly staff at this store. 🫶🏼",10,1749443988.0,NintendoSanFrancisco,1,0.92,False

Met this girl at the gym. I was wearing whatever — pajama-type gym clothes, hands a little ashy — but I still approached her. Said something light and confident, we talked, and she actually texted herself from my phone so I’d have her number.

Later, I text her and the convo was fine, but she ended it kind of abruptly like “I gotta go.” Then days go by and I hit her with a casual plan for a coffee spot. She replies the next day with super excited energy — “Ooo yay! I love coffee!!” and says she’s only free the next day, asks if that’s too soon.

I say “nah, that’s perfect,” and suggest a time. Then she vanishes.

3 days later, she texts again at night saying she worked a double shift and asks if I can “maybe do earlier” because her girls are visiting for dinner. But she doesn’t say what day the dinner is or offer an actual time. I reply cool, give her flexibility, and then she ghosts again.

Now it’s been hours. This whole interaction felt weird — high energy then random silence. Part of me wonders if it was my clothes at the gym or something I said… but I also feel like she just wasn’t serious from the beginning and liked the attention more than the idea of actually meeting.

Was I being played or was she just flakey and indecisive?

1l6vxmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/onlyfansadvicejournal/comments/1l6vxmq/how_to_create_all_your_onlyfans_page_posts_in_2/,How To Create All Your OnlyFans Page Posts In 2 Days For the Month As A Solo Creator And Stack Thousands Of Images In 3 Month.,"As a solo content creator, working alone can feel overwhelming. How do you produce hundreds of photos and videos by yourself? It’s simpler than you think—don’t overcomplicate it. When planning your content, treat it as disposable. Overthinking kills momentum, slows down content creation, and delays moving to your next look. Here’s how I help creators move fast, create more, and avoid being overly attached to their content.  
  
**Step 1: Plan Your Outfits**  
Prepare at least four complete looks. Since you’re shooting at home and summer is approaching, focus on seasonal vibes. Consider one lingerie set, one bikini, one look with oil (save this for last), and something red for the 4th of July. Ensure outfits are clean and accessorized to make them pop.  
  
**Step 2: Plan Your Locations**   
Since you’re shooting at home, choose spots where each look shines. For example:

* Lingerie: Bedroom for an intimate vibe.
* Bikini: Bathroom, styled like you’re prepping for a pool party.
* Oil: Near a window for natural light.
* 4th of July: Kitchen with fun props (e.g., a towel or patriotic items).

**Step 3: Equipment Prep**  
Evaluate your home’s lighting—where and when is it best? Schedule your shoot around peak lighting. Plan your makeup and hair: start with lighter, natural looks and progress to bolder styles. Less is more for OnlyFans content—fans want the real you. Ensure your shooting locations are clean. Charge your lights, and have baby wipes for your feet or other areas, plus a towel for spills (especially with oil).  
  
**Step 4: Equipment (If You Don’t Have Any)**  
You’ll need a phone tripod and a light. (Note: I’m not an affiliate for these.) My girlfriend uses this tripod from Amazon for $39:  
[Elitehood 6.7ft Phone Tripod](https://www.amazon.com/elitehood-Flexible-Portable-Gooseneck-Overhead/dp/B087R8LPYW)   
  
You’ll also need a clip-on light to help and make you pop a little. This one is $24.99, but you might find cheaper options on TikTok:  
[Neewer Rechargeable Clip-On Light](https://www.amazon.com/NEEWER-2000mAh-Rechargeable-Portable-NL-60AI/dp/B08VGJ1TK9)  
  
**Step 5: Shoot**  
Use the Lens Buddy App to shoot photos in automated bursts without a Bluetooth clicker—it’s a game-changer. For each outfit, aim for 320 photos, which you can edit down to 250. If you’re comfortable with full nudity and solo touching, here’s a breakdown, if not just add more photos to the areas you are:

* 40 clothed
* 40 teasing boobs
* 40 flashing
* 40 topless
* 40 teasing bottoms
* 60 nude
* 60 touching

For videos, plan:

* Clothed: 4 short videos (\~1 min each)
* Teasing boobs: 3 videos (\~1 min each)
* Flashing: 3 videos (\~1 min each)
* Topless: 4 videos (\~1-2 min each)
* Teasing bottoms: 2 videos (\~1 min each)
* Nude: 5 videos (\~1-2 min each)
* Touching: 1 longer video (5–10 min)

Photos should take about 1.5 hours, and videos around 1 hour—roughly 2.5 hours total per outfit. Stacking photos and videos together as you moves through different stages of undressing makes this much easier. I would do clothed pics, then videos, tease pics then videos, flashing pics then videos. Repeating the process helps you thinks about what would be sexy on video as you are moving through the set. Don’t worry if it takes longer initially; you’ll get faster with practice as you nail your angles, lighting, and flow. Three hours for your first shoot is a HUGE win!  
  
**Step 6: Take a Break**  
After the first outfit, pause. Grab a light snack (avoid heavy food to prevent bloating) and a coffee. Review your shots—what angles worked? What didn’t? Adjust for your next outfit, check the lighting, and stay on schedule. Get hyped!  
  
**Step 7: Outfit 2**  
Repeat Step 5 for your next look.  
  
**Final Shoot Recap -** The more you self-shoot, the better you’ll get. Have fun—play music during your shoot, have a drink to loosen up, and enjoy the process. This is about discovering what makes content creation fun and exciting. If you follow this guide, in 3 months you should have over 3K+ images and 250+ videos.

Long time user of the 9Barista. For the past year I've been settling with delicious medium-dark roasted beans and sometimes unappetizing light roasted shots. Therefore, I'm looking for some help here. 

I've been working with medium light roasts, sometimes espresso blends, and I noticed that in all of my extractions, there is a ""background coffee note"" that I can't seem to get rid of. It's a type of grassy, not exactly bitter, but just generic flavor that stops me from tasting the other stuff.

This proves difficult when dialing in, because all the information online seems to be based off of sour and bitter taste notes. Right now I'm dialing in by shot time: get close to the intended shot time with grind size, and adjust dose (usually around 14g) based on taste. But when it comes to taste, I find it hard to differentiate two shots, since the background flavor is so similar. Also, I'm already using bottled water, so it should be relatively standardized. 

Thanks for your input

1l6vsvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1l6vsvy/job_hunting/,Job hunting,"I’m a 20-year-old college student who has been struggling with my mental health since my tweens. It got really bad in high school, then I got on the right concoction of meds and started doing ketamine therapy, now I’ve just finished my sophomore year of college.
Last summer I took summer classes but I didn’t need to take any more classes this summer. My parents and I agree I need to get a job for the summer, and I’d like to continue working into the school year- this is where the issue is.
I have no experience. I never had a job in high school, I was too busy trying to get through the school day. I did do a remarkable amount of activities for how depressed I was, but through a series of situations I can’t use them as references.
I was an active member of my church’s youth group for 5 years- I was bullied by kids I thought were my friends for my mental health issues and being gay. So my family left the church (there were other factors ofc) and I can’t put my youth leader down as a reference because she allowed the bullying to happen.
I was in my high school marching band for 3 years and was an officer- I was also bullied there. The band directors saw and acknowledged it but refused to do anything about it, so I can’t put them down as references either.
The only activity I can put a reference down for is a different school club I was in for 1.5 years- The two teachers who ran it were literal godsends and probably helped save my life, but it’s not like they were my former employers or something.
That leads me to my situation now. I’m 20 with no job experience, close to no references, grades that are just okay (I picked a hard major), etc. I’ve been putting myself out there, sending my resume (with like three things on it) to every employer I can find. At this point the amount of jobs I’ve applied for has to be in the upper 30’s which now that I’m thinking about it doesn’t seem like a lot but it feels like a lot. I’ve only gotten responses from 10 employers, 7 outright rejections and 3 interviews. The first interviews went well but I was rejected from them. The third was for a coffee bar chain, I was so excited, it seems like it would be such a fun place to work and the interview went great. I felt super good about it. The manager told me I would hear from her by Friday if I got the job. It’s late Sunday night while I’m typing this. I obviously got no response, fine whatever- what’s killing me is that the platform that the company uses to get applications says my application is still in progress. So I guess I’m just in limbo.
Anyway, this is just another thing my shitty mental health has ruined and made unnecessarily hard. And of course because I got my hopes up for this job I’m now having a dip in my mood and productivity. If anyone has any advice I’d love to hear it.",3,1749443309.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

I just read a super insightful article about how to incorporate more movement into your workday, especially when all you want to do is stay glued to your chair. I totally get it! Sitting all day not only drains your energy but also has negative impacts on your heart health and increases disease risk. Luckily, experts have some great tips to help us make movement a habit.

https://preview.redd.it/g64s2mf0xt5f1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=87a9ad1b19483e0b609a68dd44bfac74d4108329

Apparently, even short movement breaks can counteract the effects of prolonged sitting, and they're essential for both physical and mental well-being. But how do you actually get up and move when your brain just wants to keep staring at the screen?

Here are 4 strategies from experts that I've summarized, hoping they'll be helpful for you all:

# 1. Use Reminders to Add Movement to Your Schedule

For most of us, long exercise breaks during work just aren't feasible. Instead, try taking a **five-minute movement break every hour**. It sounds small, but studies show that just five minutes of activity per hour can reduce cardiovascular risk and improve focus!

* **Set a timer or use an app:** Set an alarm for every 55 minutes of work to remind you to pause. When it goes off, get up and do five minutes of light activity: walk around your workspace, stretch, or do a few simple squats or lunges.
* **More subtle reminders:** Place your athletic shoes near your desk or use other visual cues. This is a ""behavior activation"" strategy – small, structured actions that help you form habits.

# 2. Make Your Movements Manageable

If you find yourself too busy to leave your desk, try incorporating **""micro-workouts.""** These are super short, simple movements you can do on the spot without interrupting your workflow.

* **Examples:** Leg lifts while sitting, calf raises while standing, or neck/hand stretches for 1-2 minutes at a time.
* **Doesn't need to be intense:** Just enough to get your blood flowing. These micro-workouts can help lower blood pressure and reduce fatigue.
* **Easy to integrate:** They are ""manageable"" and less daunting, making it easier to maintain consistency. Start with 1-2 micro-workouts a day and gradually increase the frequency of your breaks.

# 3. Buddy Up with a Friend

If you struggle with self-motivation, try **partnering with a colleague or friend.**

* **Set common goals:** Agree to check in with each other (e.g., via text every two hours) to remind each other to take movement breaks.
* **Move together:** If you work in the same space, plan to go for a few walks together during the day. If working remotely, share activity challenges through an app.
* **Social accountability:** Knowing someone else is counting on you creates huge motivation. Research shows that having social support helps people be more active, and moving with a friend also increases the likelihood that you'll enjoy the physical activity more.
* **Track and celebrate:** Use apps like Strava or Fitbit to visualize your progress together. You can even create a friendly competition or celebrate milestones (e.g., a coffee break together after a week of consistent movement).

# 4. Link Movement to Other Activities or Habits

Adopt the ""habit stacking"" method – combining a new activity with something you already do or enjoy.

* **Pair with existing routines:** ""Pair these breaks with an existing routine, like getting water or after a meeting, to help anchor movement... into something familiar."" – Dr. Khan. This will help it develop into a habit.
* **Pair with enjoyable activities:** ""Pair movement breaks with an enjoyable activity, such as listening to music or a podcast."" – Shelly Qualtieri. Over time, your brain will come to expect and look forward to the movement.
* **Apply everywhere:** Try lifting light weights while you watch TV, for example, or doing calf raises while you brush your teeth.

*Preserving energetic clarity, minimizing friction, and honoring intuitive neurodivergent design.*

Traditional Feng Shui principles, while aiming for harmony, can sometimes conflict with the practical requirements of neurodivergent individuals. The core principle of Feng Shui is creating a space where energy (Chi) flows smoothly to support well-being and purpose. For individuals with ADHD, that smooth flow depends heavily on minimizing the friction between them and the tools or spaces they need to access. Therefore, accessibility, visibility, and unobstructed physical movement become key elements of harmonious energy flow. Forcing items into certain spaces based purely on traditional rules, if it introduces barriers or increases cognitive load, can disrupt the very harmony Feng Shui aims to achieve.

For executive function support in ADHD, the key is adapting Feng Shui principles into a neurodivergent-friendly design strategy that works with the brain, reducing cognitive demands and preserving precious mental energy.

### Key Principles to Consider

Think of daily energy for those with ADHD like a phone battery with a finite charge, which, unlike people who may not consider the energy cost of basic tasks, must be meticulously budgeted. Activities like setting up last-minute meetings, interrupting focused work, or even tasks requiring unnecessary extra steps (e.g., complex storage for daily items, navigating around obstacles) act like sudden, massive power drains, halting momentum and potentially causing severe overwhelm. Pushing past limits doesn't just mean being tired tomorrow; it risks a system crash requiring days of recovery and significantly reduced capacity afterward.

Therefore, simple, intuitive environments with visible, easily accessible essentials—minimizing steps, cognitive load, and physical friction—are the crucial charging infrastructure needed to prevent multi-day burnout and sustain focus.

*   **Accessibility and Visibility are Key:** For individuals with ADHD, having frequently used items within arm’s reach and sight supports focus, minimizes distraction, and reduces the mental burden of remembering where things are. “Out of sight, out of mind” is a very real challenge, so designing with consistency and visual reinforcement sustains executive function.
*   **Functional Zoning and Workflow:** Organize items in a way that makes sense for the individual's daily flow. Creating activity-specific zones—such as a work station, bedtime setup, self-care nook, or coffee prep area—helps reduce decision fatigue and supports productivity by anchoring tools where they’re naturally used.
*   **Clarity of Movement = Clarity of Mind:** For those with ADHD, spatial and mental clarity are deeply connected. Interruptions to natural movement can be mentally taxing. Detours, blocked hallways, or inefficient layouts can trigger mental friction, disorientation, and decision fatigue. Direct, obstacle-free movement between high-use zones (e.g., desk to kitchen, hallway to bathroom) preserves crucial cognitive energy and momentum, reduces overwhelm, and keeps the nervous system regulated.

### ✅ DO

*   **Prioritize Ease of Access & Intuitive Flow:** Keep frequently used items visible and directly reachable from where they are used—such as work tools at your desk, skincare on the sink, or nightstand essentials by your bed. This prevents energy leaks from repetitive searching or obstacle navigation. For ADHD minds, accessibility supports rhythm and predictability, not clutter.
*   **Create a ""Launching Pad"" & Activity Zones:** Designate specific areas—like a hook, tray, or shelf near the entrance—for keys, wallet, charger, or daily carry items. Implement activity-based “stations” for common routines. Whether it's a work zone, morning self-care area, or exit-prep corner, keeping all essentials for that activity grouped and reachable improves flow and eliminates last-minute scrambling.
*   **Create Clear 'Homes' for Items:** Establish consistent, visible locations where things belong—even if that’s on an open shelf or surface. Don’t worry about tucking everything away. For ADHD functionality, predictability is peace. Reducing “Where does this go again?” decisions decreases internal chaos and builds momentum. Remove excess items in bedrooms, especially work-related clutter, to restore rest energy.
*   **Use Open Storage with Visibility:** Choose open baskets, trays, shelves, wall hooks, or clear bins. These allow you to see what’s inside at a glance and reduce multi-step storage that drains energy. This strategy honors modern Feng Shui principles that embrace visibility as a tool for harmony, especially in small or shared spaces.
*   **Optimize Workflow Stations:** Arrange tools and materials logically by how they are used. For example, keep printer paper near the printer, coffee mugs near the coffee maker, or notebooks near the desk. Items should follow the natural sequence of tasks to reduce mental effort and keep your attention in rhythm.
*   **Support Energetic Flow:** Layouts should ensure spatial rhythm and prioritize direct, intuitive paths through the home—especially between high-use areas like kitchens, workspaces, and rest zones. Interrupting these routes with clutter or clusters of objects can cause cognitive friction, disrupt momentum, and drain energy. ADHD minds rely on direct movement to stay in rhythm. Clear physical flow mirrors mental clarity; movement through space should feel instinctive, unbroken, and energetically smooth.
*   **Moderate Visual Stimulation:** Choose artwork with calming, spacious themes like soft landscapes or natural scenes. Reduce visual clutter and limit the number of images on the walls. Too much visual input—especially covering every wall—can fragment attention, accelerate mental fatigue, and prevent visual rest.
*   **Regulate Sensory Input with Grounding Design:** Use calming elements like natural textures (wood, stone, cotton), soft lighting, greenery, and earthy tones—including muted palettes and soft blues—to reduce overstimulation and anchor the nervous system. Representing the Earth Element in Feng Shui principles are especially beneficial for ADHD environments where nervous system grounding is key.
*   **Use Aromatherapy:** Diffusing essential oils like vetiver, lavender, or cedarwood can help regulate emotional overwhelm and restore clarity. Scent memory is powerful; choose consistent aromas for work zones or bedtime to strengthen state-based routines.

### ❌ DON’T

*   **Don’t Hide Daily Essentials:** Avoid placing regularly used items behind closed doors, nested bins, or within storage systems that require multiple steps to retrieve. Complex containment = cognitive battery drain. Visibility and ease-of-access are not clutter; they are design allies for clarity, energy flow, and peace.
*   **Don’t Prioritize Aesthetics Over Function:** Avoid forcing design rules (like minimalism or “no objects on the counter”) that interfere with real-life needs. If a critical cognitive anchor requests a visible system like a basket of chargers or a sink tray for skincare sustains flow, it’s functional harmony—even if it breaks certain design rules.
*   **Don’t Force Complex Storage Systems:** Steer clear of highly segmented organizers, tiny compartments, or solutions that require precise placement to maintain. ADHD brains need intuitive systems with low maintenance. If it takes more energy to return the item than to leave it out, the system will fail.
*   **Don’t Mistake Clutter for Chaos—Respect Functional Systems:** What looks like clutter to someone else may be an active working system for a neurodivergent mind. Function isn’t always minimalist. Respect the logic behind what’s visible vs. what is genuinely unused. Tidy can mean parallel lines, clear zones, or visible order—not emptiness. Intuition creates its own symmetry. Rearranging items based purely on aesthetics can unravel momentum, increase cognitive load, and damage emotional safety.

Hong Kong Station 2go -  first time trying the second location (getting the food 2 go as the name implies) and first time trying the Szechuan Pork Belly (think it's called twice cooked pork on the online menu) and Beef Chao Fan...after a long day of yard work this was mind blowingly delicious (paired nicely with an ice cold Italian Pilsner from Upslope)

Shout Out #2 Bull and Bush Brewery for Brunch
First off, the service at this place is always top notch, efficient, friendly, but not over bearing....
For brunch we shared ""The Cure"" (with Chorizo) and the Brunch Chicken Fried Chicken, my wife and I almost got into an argument trying to decide which one was better, both were absolutely stellar and paired well with the Genessee Espresso Stout (brewed with Corvus Coffee)

Nothing like being absolutely delighted after enjoying a meal!

I ended up going back to office while he started this business. He simply replicates another store just changed the recipe and logo. He got some hardship when opening, i lent him some money and he payed it back. Happy for his success, truly.

1 and a half year passed. Here i am still stuck on office while he is up to his 4th store. Thinking now, i felt like i can just open the same business, simply change the recipe and logo.

Talked to him and turned out he thought it is not ethic. We had a conversation, basically my point of view is, it is not a proprietary business, it wans't a tech business or something hard. It is just a normal business like tea, coffee, fruits, etc. He also replicate another business.
