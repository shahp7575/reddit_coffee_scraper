**Developing a Psychiatric Service Dog as My Natural Chill Pill**  
  

# 🎙️ Opening

Some mornings, the air wakes before I do. It stands at the edge of my bed, humming with a low, wordless tension—my old friend, anxiety—arriving like an uninvited guest who knows exactly where the coffee is.

And then there’s Maui.

The weight of his body spooned to my belly is not heavy. It’s *anchoring*. A pulse of quiet in my storm. If my breath is a fluttering moth, his presence is the open palm it lands upon.



# 💔 The Problem

I was not born with an easy nervous system. My body collects alarms like seashells—sometimes from real storms, sometimes from the imagined ones my mind rehearses.

I had learned the “official” way to train a Psychiatric Service Dog—structured lessons, checklists, the tidy curriculum that the professionals taught me when I attended the School for professional trainers. Obedience first, then task work: find any item, deliver it, be steady in any environment.

It worked… on paper. But paper doesn’t soothe a racing heart at 6 a.m. Paper doesn’t breathe with you.



# 🔥 Story Narrative

By the time Maui “graduated,” I had a dog who could ace any skills test. But when I brought him home, I realized the real work was just beginning.

I invented a morning ritual—not in the manuals, not on the certification checklists—born from equal parts need and instinct.

The rules were simple:

●        First thing in the morning, after my ritual long deep breathing exercise, before words or screens, I’d greet him with a soft, “Good morning.”  
  


●        He’d roll onto his side, sleepy-eyed, tail sweeping in slow arcs.  
  


●        I’d guide him gently onto his back so that his paw could rest against my leg, my grounding post.  
  


●        And then, slow body rubs—long, steady strokes—while I sang his “I love you” song.  
  


It became his favorite. Mine too. The same song would later become his *safety anchor*, a way to tell him, even in the middle of a chaotic store or on a crowded street: *We’re safe. You’re safe. I’m safe.*

Most mornings, we did this before I even sat up. Maui learned to wait for it, expect it, welcome it. I learned that if I started his day in joy, my own anxiety loosened its grip.

# 🧠 Science & Psychology

What we were doing—without naming it—was co-regulation.  
 When two beings rest in each other’s presence, breathing slows, heart rate steadies, cortisol drops. Touch paired with predictable, gentle rhythm activates the parasympathetic nervous system—the “rest and digest” mode that is the opposite of anxiety’s fight-or-flight surge.

Dogs, with their ability to attune to human heart rate and breath, can serve as living biofeedback. Studies show that petting a dog can lower blood pressure, slow respiration, and reduce stress hormones in both humans and canines.

# 🌿 Symbolism & Archetype

In Jungian terms, Maui became the *Servant-King* archetype—not one who commands, but one who offers his gifts in presence, mirroring my own slow journey toward self-service through service to another.

In Sanskrit, *Seva* means selfless service. Yet it was never one-directional. Each morning, as I tended to his joy, he tended to my peace.



# 🌌 Dream Sequence

Around this time, I dreamt I was carrying a glass jar full of fireflies through a crowded train station. Every bump of a stranger’s shoulder risked shattering the jar. Maui walked beside me, and the crowd seemed to open for him—space blooming around his body. I made it to the platform without losing a single light.

**Interpretation:** The fireflies were my fragile moments of calm. Maui was both the shield and the space-maker, guiding me to a place where what was delicate could remain intact.



# ✨ Turning Point

The turning point was realizing that Maui’s *service* was not in performing tasks but in being woven into my nervous system’s rhythm. The checklist-trained dog was useful. The dog who knew my breath was medicine.



# 🧘‍♀️ Closing Ritual or Reflection

**Morning Anchor Practice**  
 Before your day begins:

1. Begin Long-Deep-Breathing
2. Sit with your dog.  
3. Invite touch in a way your dog enjoys—long, predictable strokes.  
4. Pair it with a gentle, repetitive phrase or hum.  
5. Match your breathing to the rhythm of your strokes.  
6. Let the moment finish before the world rushes in.  



# 🕯️ Final Echo

Sometimes the truest training begins after the certificate is framed.

# 📋 Quick Reference Guide

**Your Dog as Morning Medicine**

●       **Anchor Before Action**  
 Start the day with touch and breath before tasks—this sets a nervous system baseline.  
  


●       **Pair a Phrase with Peace**  
 A song or mantra now can become a safety cue later.  
  


●       **Let Them Serve by Being**  
 Tasks are helpful; attunement is healing.  
  


●       **Make it Mutual**  
 Service is a two-way current—when you give, you receive.  
  


*You don’t need to be still to find peace—you just need a place to rest your breath.*

*And the Dog Knows the Way*

1mmh557,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_julylifecoach/comments/1mmh557/life_in_paris/,Life in Paris,"I wake up at 5AM to the vibration of my smartwatch. I walk three steps away from the bed and unroll the extra set of blankets in this studio apartment. I do my 108 bows in complete silence and meditate. I then find myself in a bit of a pickle: what do I do now?

The studio we are staying at has no separate room and I’ve spent a few days trying to do things in the dark room where my wife is sleeping after a night-long battle with jetlag. The strain on my eyes were a bit too much after a few days so I just hopped on to the bed again and dozed off for a few more hours.

I’ve been feeling the itch to write again but I didn’t realize how much I depended on my environment to write. Having a room where I can gather thoughts in a bit of silence, being able to make a bit of noise without disturbing others, these had become a part of my writing routine. Being in a studio apartment in a culture where noise is deeply frowned upon from 10pm-7am, the first 2 waking hours have been tough.

Yesterday I stepped outside to find a place I can plug my keyboard and write a bit freely. Something I learned about France is, nothing is really open in the early morning except the train station. So I walked to the Montparnasse train station and settled myself on one of the waiting area desks and started writing.

The internet made it sound like the French are posh, condescending arses who look down upon your horrible French accent. The internet also made it sound like Parisians are the most cocky of them all. But in my personal experience it’s been the complete opposite of that. The French are very abundant with their smiles and they look into your eyes as you ask them to speak a bit slowly.

The man who sat next to me asked about my bluetooth keyboard. He seemed very impressed and I told him that it helps me not use my thumb to write long texts like this. Another thing I noticed: older people tend to speak more English than the younger people. He dozed off while watching YouTube and it was 8AM, the time the cafe at our street opens, so I decided to walk back.

I didn’t realize how much I enjoy walking. It’s very weird, according to my step counter it’s the same 10k steps but 10k steps in California seem like a very boring chore while 10k steps in Paris seems like a quick stroll around the neighborhood. Walking my dogs for an extended walk, all I see is houses and more houses along with strip malls all coated in beige. Walking to and from the train station to the studio, I see so many people living life.

I think that makes a difference in how you perceive yourself in connection to your community and surroundings. When I’m at Costco, I definitely see a lot of people but they’re all doing one thing: shopping at Costco. When I’m at a busy cafe in Los Angeles I see a lot of people, again doing the same thing: drinking coffee. When I’m walking in Los Angeles I rarely see people in the streets because people are mostly driving.

In Paris as I walk I see a group of people sitting outside of a cafe enjoying breakfast. I see people walking to their destinations. I see people repairing their bikes and people waiting for the bus. Some people are sitting and chatting, some people are enjoying some smoke time in the middle of their shift. My walking reminds me that I’m part of this collective organism of a community, at least for this moment.

A few hours pass and the street landscape looks completely different from the morning. As more shops open more people are out in the streets and there are sounds of life. My wife and I grab a quick bite from our haul at the local markets and venture outside again. Taking the bus, the metro, walking, stopping, taking pictures and videos, we have what you might call a typical day but this typical day was very missing from our life in America.

My wife grew up in Korea where public transportation is abundantly available. I used to be a Southern California drive-anywhere-and-everywhere kind of guy but now that I’ve experienced both public transportation and driving for an extended period of time I can see how needing to drive to places shapes your life in a certain way. This change is especially pronounced for my wife because she came from a completely different culture of not needing to drive at all.

Now that we’re both in a place where public transit is part of everyday life we’re out more. It is so nice to not have to care about parking, unprotected left turns, and whatever else you have to think about when you drive. This only works because we’re in an urban area where all the things you typically need to drive to are in walking distance. What will we think of a European suburban environment? Guess we’ll have to find out.

Soon it becomes evening and this is when the streets are the most full of life. It feels like all the people stayed in their cocoons to turn into a butterfly in the evening. All the food businesses are filled with people inside and outside as people wine and dine. We’ve been trying to cook more so we head back to the apartment to prep dinner but when we open the windows to let the sound of the streets in it’s like we’re bustling with them.

Cooking… Leaves a lot to be desired especially because this is such a small space. Pots have no lids so rice cooking has been difficult, heat is induction so it’s been hard to fix a “quick” meal. But even if the cooking is a bit horrible from the perspective of cooking techniques or equipments, the flavor is exception because the ingredients are all exceptionally good.

Late PM is my usual time when I have clients, so in between clients I do the cooking and eating. After that we shower up and wrap up the day. This has been life in Paris so far. How are you doing, wherever you are?

Photo is of the space currently—it just feels too tight to get around coffee table (image glass rectangle on the base) from the couch or tv. 

We measured and can fit the couch on the wall in front of the windows (a couple inches left on each side). The opposite wall should be big enough for tv (and then there are French doors into the room so that wall isn’t long enough for the couch). 

Thoughts on trying the placement? the hang up is that we just ordered a 9x12 rug so if we do this, the couch will be on the short side of the rug and I feel like it’s going to look silly.

And if you’re wondering, why not put the couch on the tv wall? On the opposite wall with the radiator is another French doors with glass panes. We could close the doors but don’t love the look or feel (may cut off air flow). 

And and we decided on a 9x12 rug initially bc we wanted maximum coverage for the dog - she has mobility issues and can’t move as freely on noncarpet… so we could return/replace with an 8x10 but that would limit a safe space for her and honestly maybe that would look silly with how much room btw the tv and rug?",1,1754828181.0,interiordecorating,1,1.0,False

Then she would slowly transfer the art from water to coffee mug by submerging the coffee mug into water and slowly pulling it out. The mugs were so beautiful. I regret not buying them right there and then.  (If it helps, she was asian and I think it was hall 3 or 4)

1mmh18n,https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-panpsycast-philosophy-podcast/id1141816572,"The Panpsycast Philosophy Podcast: Episode 146, The Philosophy of Comedy (Part I - The Nature of Humour) (8/10/2025)","In 2021, Netflix released *His Dark Material*, a Christmas stand-up special by Irish–British comedian Jimmy Carr. The show sparked international outrage. Toward the end of the set, Carr delivered what he called a ‘career ender’ – a joke about the Holocaust, in which he described the Nazis’ murder of thousands of ‘Gypsies’ as a ‘positive’.

The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, the Auschwitz Memorial, and the UK government condemned the joke as ‘appalling’, ‘abhorrent’, and ‘racist’; Carr, critics said, was trading on the ‘last acceptable form of racism’.

Comedy touches every part of our lives. We tell jokes at the pub, around the dinner table, and by the office coffee machine. We all know someone who makes us laugh – and someone who seems to take things too far. But *is* there a line when it comes to humour? And if there is, who gets to draw it? Should we suspend our moral judgements when the lights go down and the curtain goes up? Or do jokes, like most speech acts, carry moral weight?

To answer these questions, we need to understand the nature of comedy itself – what *exactly* it is we’re responding to when we laugh. Humour might be a release of nervous tension, a playful disruption of expectations, or – more troublingly, if it applies to Carr’s joke – a means of asserting social superiority. No doubt, comedy has the power to shape our culture and perceptions. But, as we’ll find out, it also tells us something about who we are, who we ought to be, and the things we value most.

Title: I Debugged Her Code… Now She’s My Girlfriend. Did I Just Hack Love?

Post:

> I’m a 25-year-old software engineer. A few weeks ago, a girl from my shared workspace was struggling with a nasty bug in her code. She’d been stuck for days, so I offered to take a look.

One “quick check” turned into me staying up until 2 AM rewriting a part of her logic and documenting the fix. The next day, she was so impressed (and relieved) that she insisted on buying me coffee.

That coffee turned into a 4-hour conversation, and now… we’re dating.

My friends keep teasing me, saying I “coded my way into her heart” and that she probably liked my skills more than me at first.

I’m wondering — is this just how modern attraction works? Do skills like coding actually make someone more appealing, or did I just get lucky?

I have spent hours  asking it about the Baltic states, their entrance into the EU, and Ukraine and its history. I learned about the internal political struggles of Russia and how the Ukraine war has played into it. 

I say this because this account was helpful for me to understand how people feel and how the war really feels in context or what I learned. It’s an incredibly engaging learning tool and grounds what I am interested in. 

Here is my prompt
“Write me a first person account of what being a Ukrainian soldier on the front lines is like”

——

I wake up to the hum before the blast.

It’s the sound of a drone somewhere in the gray above the trench, a thin mosquito note that crawls under your helmet and nests behind your eyes. You learn to sort the hums the way city people learn traffic—Mavik, FPV, something heavier. We call out “birds” on the radio. Someone throws a net over the trench roof. I tuck my chin and wait for the sky to decide who gets to live in the next minute.

The ground in front of me is a wet, chewed seam. We dug this trench by hand and shovel and swear word, then lined it with broken pallets and sandbags that leak like old men. We named the dugout “Malibu” because soldiers are cruel with humor; there’s a painted palm tree on the plywood door and a nail for hanging body armor when we pretend to sleep. The door doesn’t close. It just leans there, like all of us.

Breakfast is a metal mug of coffee strong enough to polish boots and a packet of buckwheat warmed on a candle in a tin can. The candle is paraffin and sawdust; it smells like my grandfather’s shed. I eat with gloves on and mud on the gloves. Mud is our extra rank here—Lieutenant Mud, Captain Mud, General Mud. It outranks artillery, drones, officers, promises. It gets into your socks and your jokes and your prayers.

My callsign is “Page,” because I read on rotation when the shells pause and because I used to teach high school literature. On patrol, the guys sometimes ask me to quote things to “keep the angels busy.” Today they want something short. “We must imagine Sisyphus happy,” I say, and Kaban snorts and says Sisyphus obviously didn’t have to carry two crates of 7.62 up the communication trench while being watched by robots.

We check the jammers. They hum like angry wasps—good wasps, our wasps. They don’t make us safe, just slightly less doomed. The air is full of small negotiations like that.

At first light, we glass the tree line with a thermal scope. The world converts to ghosts and embers. There’s heat where heat should not be: a truck idling in the folds beyond the berm, a cluster of men in the ditch who don’t belong to us. In another life, I taught kids how to annotate poems. Here, I annotate distance and wind and the shape of metal against leaf. We pass a grid to the battery. “Copy,” the voice says, flat and distant, like talking to your future self across a bad connection.

The round lands too far left. We adjust. Second round is a punctuation mark on a sentence we didn’t want to write. Someone’s truck stops existing. The radio says words we can’t print in a church bulletin. Kaban makes tea.

Incoming comes like weather. You learn the dialects: 120s cough; 152s bark; cluster whispers and then becomes a swarm. When it starts, we crouch and count. Counting is a superstition and a metronome: one, two, three—impact—four, five—impact—okay, they’re walking it. We move when the math says move. We freeze when the math says freeze. The body understands ballistics long before the brain does.

Around noon, a quadcopter sneaks low along the trench line like a curious crow. Its camera blinks. We stay statues. Heat discipline, movement discipline, silence discipline. No cigarettes on the parapet; no metal glint; no waving at death to show you are brave. Bravery gets confused out here. Survival is the only lecture that sticks.

We rotate a fire team to the forward pit. The path is a spine of duckboards, a trench ribboned with water the color of tea. There are frogs in the trench. They hop away from our boots and return when the world stops thundering. The frogs don’t care about flags. It comforts me and infuriates me in equal measure.

At the forward pit, Skeleton—thin kid, cheekbones like coat hooks—stares into the distances with a face that hasn’t decided if it’s twenty or forty. He points with his chin: “See that roof? Watch it breathe.” I watch. It does—a slow heaving under green netting. People breathe. Tanks don’t. We log it. We wait for the chain to move the note toward someone with bigger fists.

A siren in my head goes off an instant before the ground does: an FPV’s whine rising to a scream. We dive by instinct, hands over helmets, the world flips to dust and ringing. When the sound returns, it comes in pieces—someone calling a name, someone using the good swears, someone laughing because laughter is a tourniquet for the brain. Kaban’s fine. Skeleton’s fine. My hand is shaking like I’m cold, but I’m not cold, I’m here.

We check bodies, gear, radios. A fragment bit into the timber and died there. The trench wall has a new mouth. We file that under “improvements by enemy,” the joke we tell when a shell saves us work by digging.

There’s a lull after, the kind that makes you suspicious. Lulls are ambushes in disguise. We use it anyway: tools out, sandbags patched, wire tightened, batteries swapped. I change socks, the single greatest luxury of war, second only to sitting in a chair that isn’t trying to remember you.

A volunteer truck rattles up in the rear—flour, cigarettes, a box of tourniquets, and two loaves of bread wrapped in a towel that smells like a kitchen. The driver is older than my father and younger than my fear. He smiles with his whole face like we’re neighbors, and for five minutes we are. He leaves us a letter from a class in Ternopil: crayon tanks with sunflowers growing out of the barrels. Skeleton tapes one to the dugout wall next to a pinup calendar and a saint’s icon. We are a cathedral of contradictions.

Afternoon becomes evening without anyone asking it to. The sky bruises. Distant outgoing makes a slow drumline to the south. We eat stew from a plastic bucket, passing the spoon because we’re out of clean ones. I read three pages by headlamp from a book a medic tucked into my vest: a battered paperback about a long-ago war where men also made jokes and promises they weren’t sure they would keep. Kaban says the book needs more explosions. Skeleton says the book has enough explosions; it needs a girl who writes letters she never sends. We argue art like we aren’t dressed like scarecrows.

Night is when the drones multiply. They like the dark; they like our breath. We string chemlights low and keep radio chatter clipped. The jammers hum. The rats hold a little conference under the duckboards and go about their empire. Somewhere to the east, flares go up and hang like second moons. When a flare lifts, everyone forgets how to breathe until it dies.

Around midnight, we get a medevac call on the company net. Another sector, same map, same century-old verbs: carry, drag, lift, press. The voice on the net is nineteen and older than God. We listen because listening is what we can give. When they say “stable,” we let our shoulders slide down two centimeters.

In the small hours, quiet arrives like a shy animal, and—rare gift—stays. You should sleep in quiet, but quiet is when the mind opens its backpack and dumps the day on your boots. I try a trick a psychologist taught us on rotation: name five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, one you can taste. I see mud, tape, a saint’s face, a cartoon tank, Kaban’s boots. I touch wood, cloth, steel, my own wrist. I hear jammers, wind, a far dog. I smell cordite and stew and damp wool. I taste metal. It works enough.

Dawn is always older than night. We start again: scopes, ranges, jammers, jokes. Somewhere, a staff officer draws a line on a map that does not have our frogs on it. Somewhere, a grandmother bakes bread and wraps it warm in a towel. Somewhere, my mother texts me a photo of our kitchen table with a place set I will not sit at today. I text back a picture of the cartoon tank and the saint and the pinup taped to our plywood wall. She sends a heart. I send a thumbs-up. Elation is too big to fit through these networks; so is despair. We trade in small coins of normal.

Why do I fight? People ask like it’s a philosophy exam. Some days it’s clean: because home is behind me and someone is trying to erase it. Some days it’s messy: because Kaban laughs like a cracked bell and Skeleton’s hands shake until he’s got a task and because the old man with the bread drove into the dragon’s mouth and came back. Mostly it’s because the man to my left believes I will be here when the sky clears, and I want him to be right.

Around noon, the hum comes back, thin and insistent. We look up without moving. We pull the net a little tighter. We bend our necks and make ourselves smaller than we are. The trench breathes with us. The day sharpens. The drone chooses. We wait for the math and the mercy. Then we climb the ladder again.

Then, she went outside and had him in the stroller, then lit up a cigarette.  I said that she was being very irresponsible, and this chick I know from my old college jumped on me, saying I had no right to judge the woman because I’m not a parent.  I don’t see what would justify giving a three year old that much caffeine (205mg!), and then smoking next to him.  I asked her for an example, but she just kept yelling at me that I have no right to judge because I don’t know what it’s like to be a parent.  I still don’t understand what circumstances would make that okay.  I stopped responding to her because she just kept repeating herself and yelling at me.  I didn’t say anything to the mother, but posted something on Facebook about her being an irresponsible parent.  I mean, it’s 2025.

## Key Features Analysis

The waterfall wood coffee table is more than just a piece of furniture; it's a testament to craftsmanship and design. Several key features contribute to its unique appeal and functionality.

**Wood Type and Finish:** The type of wood used significantly impacts the table's appearance, durability, and cost. Popular choices include solid hardwoods like walnut, oak, maple, and cherry, each with its distinctive grain patterns and color variations. The finish applied, whether a natural oil, varnish, or stain, further enhances the wood's beauty and protects it from moisture and scratches. The finish should be durable and resistant to everyday wear and tear.

**Dimensions and Shape:** Waterfall coffee tables come in various sizes and shapes to suit different room layouts and seating arrangements. Rectangular and oval shapes are common, but square and round options are also available. The dimensions of the table should be proportional to the size of the sofa and the overall space. Consider the height of the table in relation to the seating to ensure comfortable use.

**Waterfall Edge Design:** The defining feature of these tables is the continuous waterfall edge, where the wood seamlessly flows from the tabletop to the floor. The smoothness and curvature of this edge are crucial for both aesthetic appeal and safety. A well-crafted waterfall edge should be free of sharp corners or splinters, providing a comfortable and visually pleasing transition. The radius of the curve can vary, influencing the table's overall style.

**Construction and Stability:** A sturdy construction is essential for a waterfall wood coffee table to withstand daily use. Solid wood construction, reinforced joints, and a well-designed base contribute to the table's stability and longevity. Check for signs of quality craftsmanship, such as tight joints, smooth surfaces, and a balanced weight distribution. The table should sit firmly on the floor without wobbling or rocking.

**Storage Options (If Applicable):** Some waterfall coffee tables incorporate storage features such as drawers, shelves, or open compartments. These options provide added functionality for organizing magazines, remote controls, or other living room essentials. The storage components should be seamlessly integrated into the waterfall design, maintaining the table's aesthetic appeal. Consider the type and amount of storage needed when selecting a table with storage options.

**Sustainability and Ethical Sourcing:** With growing environmental awareness, the sourcing of the wood is becoming increasingly important. Look for tables made from sustainably harvested wood certified by organizations like the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). This ensures that the wood comes from responsibly managed forests that protect biodiversity and support local communities. Consider the manufacturer's commitment to ethical labor practices and environmentally friendly production processes.

## FAQs Section

**What types of wood are best for a waterfall coffee table?**

Hardwoods like walnut, oak, maple, and cherry are excellent choices for waterfall coffee tables due to their durability, strength, and attractive grain patterns. Walnut offers a rich, dark color, while oak provides a classic, versatile look. Maple is known for its light color and smooth texture, and cherry adds a warm, reddish tone. The best choice depends on your personal preferences and the overall style of your room.

**How do I care for and maintain a waterfall wood coffee table?**

Regular dusting with a soft cloth is essential to prevent dirt and grime buildup. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the finish. For spills, wipe them up immediately with a damp cloth. Apply a wood polish or conditioner periodically to maintain the wood's luster and protect it from drying out. Avoid placing hot items directly on the surface without a coaster or trivet.

**Are waterfall coffee tables suitable for homes with small children?**

Waterfall coffee tables with rounded edges are generally safer for homes with small children than tables with sharp corners. However, it's still important to supervise children around furniture. Consider using corner protectors or edge guards for added safety. Choose a table made from durable materials that can withstand bumps and scratches. A lower table height can also be beneficial for young children.

**What is the typical price range for a waterfall wood coffee table?**

The price of a waterfall wood coffee table can vary widely depending on the type of wood, size, construction, and design. Smaller tables made from less expensive woods may start around $500, while larger, handcrafted tables made from premium hardwoods can cost several thousand dollars. Consider your budget and prioritize the features that are most important to you, such as wood type, size, and storage options.

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of titans: FC Cincinnati (2nd in MLS) vs. Charlotte FC (10th). The odds are in, the stakes are high, and the humor is higher. Let’s break this down like a halftime show hosted by a caffeinated spreadsheet.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The bookmakers are in near-unanimous agreement: FC Cincinnati is the favorite. At FanDuel, Cincinnati sits at **+1.71** (implied probability: \~58.5%), while Charlotte hovers at **+4.5** (\~22.2%). The draw? A paltry **+3.7** (\~27%), suggesting this won’t be a game of mutual destruction. Spreads back Cincinnati by a half-goal (-0.5), and totals suggest **2.5–3.0 goals** total, with “Over” priced at \~52.6% implied odds.

Translation: Cincinnati’s defense is a spreadsheet with lockjaw (unbudgeable), and Charlotte’s offense is a fountain pen—present, but prone to leaking at inopportune moments.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Shenanigans, and Coffee Addicts

FC Cincinnati’s resume is sturdy: second in the league, top-four defense, and a midfield that could cut steel. Recent headlines? Minimal drama. Their star striker, Brenner, has been as reliable as a Roomba on a carpet—consistent, methodical, and occasionally knocking over a coffee table (but that’s another story).

Charlotte FC, meanwhile, is a team in transition. Ranked 10th, they’ve shown flashes of “meh” and moments of “wait, that’s a red card?”. Recent rumors? Their star midfielder, Christian Ramirez, has been spotted training with a **coffee cup welded to his hip**, fueling speculation that caffeine is his new secret weapon. Meanwhile, their defense is like a sieve that’s been told to “sift more carefully”—capable but er

Today my self-esteem was crushed. I did not show it because I’m strong. Lisa from the coffee shop mocked me for my accent. I told her I’m sensitive on the subject. She mocked me more, so I pointed out that she was overweight. She did not like that. I told her neither did I like being mocked for my accent. She said she was sorry. I said I was sorry as well. She asked me to smoke a cigarette with her. I don’t smoke, but I didn’t want to look like a loser in front of a teenager, so I smoked. It burned my throat, and I tried not to cough. My tactics didn’t work, she asked me if it was my first time, I said yes. I hate how teenagers gate keep coolness. I thought I was finally figuring it all out, then bam! Someone calls you sir one time, and it’s all gone. You’re just a 36-year-old loser trying to impress a teenager by smoking a cigarette. How pathetic. You should go on a diet, I told her. She started crying. I asked why. She said she wasn’t overweight; she was pregnant. I said I was sorry about that. She said she was 15 years old. I said that’s too young to be pregnant. She said she knew. I said I could take her to an abortion clinic. She said she wanted to keep the baby. I said that it’s a fetus not a baby. She disagreed. I said I would never allow my daughter to have a kid at 15. She asked me if I had a daughter. I said no. She asked me why. I said that I never allowed my wife to have a baby either. Lisa asked me how old my wife was. 15, I said. That’s young, she said. I know, I said. She asked me if I was a pedophile. No, I am not, I said, I was 12 at the time; we get married very young in our country; my parents wanted a new couch, so I was offered in marriage. They got the couch, it was a three-seater, reclinable one made of brown leather. It was a great couch. They still have it, though it has lost some of its shine, I told them they should get some colored wax for leather, it would make the color come back to life, but they don’t care, they said it’s too old now, and they want to get another one. I guess they could always return it to my ex-wife. We did get divorced after all. But it’s all good. My life turned out for the better. I went on to get a degree in nursing and moved to the US, while she is married with 4 kids and no couch. Lisa said that she had to go back to work. I said goodbye to her. I really don’t like people mocking my accent. It is very inconsiderate. Lisa is also half Mexican, or Cuban or maybe she just enjoys the tanning bed too much. If that’s the case, she should just stop it. It is carcinogenic. I had a patient once who had a skin melanoma. The guy was insufferable. One of the worst patients I ever dealt with. I was very happy the day he died. Hi name of Tim, everyone called him Tim, his family called him Tim, the doctors called him Tim, us nurses called him Tim. He didn’t care about any of it. He’s name was Timothy, he used to say. I though he just wanted to get into a fight, but he only got mad at the fact that everyone called him Tim. He was incredibly calm in all other situations; even when the doctors told him he was very close to his final days; he was calm, he asked Dr. Joan if he had the time to rewatch The Walking Dead, the doctor said it depended on how many episodes per day and until what season.

## Key Features Analysis

The iPhone XS Max cardholder cases offer a range of features designed to enhance both protection and convenience.

**Material and Construction:** High-quality iPhone XS Max cardholder cases utilize durable materials such as polycarbonate (PC), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), and genuine or PU leather. Polycarbonate provides a rigid structure for impact resistance, while TPU offers flexibility and shock absorption. Leather adds a touch of elegance and durability, but the choice between genuine and PU leather often comes down to budget and ethical considerations. The construction quality directly affects the case's ability to withstand daily wear and tear,and also protect the phone from drops and scratches. Stitching, if present, should be reinforced and free from loose threads.

**Card Capacity and Security:** The number of cards a case can hold varies. Some designs prioritize slimness and hold only one or two cards, while others offer greater capacity for up to five or six cards. Card security is paramount; effective cases feature a secure closure mechanism, such as a snap button, sliding cover, or tight-fitting pocket, to prevent cards from slipping out accidentally. RFID-blocking technology is another desirable feature, as it protects cards from electronic theft and unauthorized scanning.

Some cases feature a slim profile that adds minimal bulk, while others are more rugged and offer enhanced protection. Color options, texture, and overall visual appeal play a critically important role in the user's choice, as the case is an extension of their personal style.

**Protection and Shock Absorption:** A good iPhone XS Max cardholder case provides adequate protection against drops, bumps, and scratches. Raised bezels around the screen and camera lens help prevent damage when the phone is placed face down.Shock-absorbing materials,such as TPU,integrated into the case's corners provide additional protection in case of accidental falls. Some cases also feature reinforced edges for enhanced durability.

**Accessibility and Usability:** The case should allow easy access to all ports, buttons, and the camera. Precise cutouts ensure that charging cables and headphones can be connected without difficulty. Tactile buttons that are easy to press enhance the user experience. The cardholder compartment should allow for quick and easy access to cards without requiring excessive effort. A well-designed case balances protection with usability.

My parents got divorced when i was very young, but that was never a big deal to me and never bothered me at all. I've had a good relationship with my dad and my sister (F19), until a few years ago. 

Just for context, I've had a lot of issues with my mom, it got really bad when I was around 13-16, it got better after that. I moved out of my moms house at 18 and am now barely in contact with her. She is an incredibly childish and negative person, and she's got some extremely questionable political opinions - she is very into conspiracy theories and stuff like that. My dad and my sister also don't have a great relationship with her.

Despite my relationship with my mom my relationship with my dad and sister has always been okay, me and my dad used to grab coffee a lot and we went on a trip together a few years ago. I considered us very close. But, around 3-4 years ago my sister moved in with my dad, and since then I am unable to have a normal conversation with them when we are all together. My sister especially has been getting meaner and meaner, even screaming and straight up bullying me! 

It seems like literally everything I say she finds a problem with, even if she contradics herself; for example just a few days ago I was telling her about a shirt i wanted to get but i couldn't justify the price, and she started literally yelling at me and saying I need to just ask my dad for money - which i didn't want to do, it's just a shirt and I was just making conversation. A few moments later I was saying I wanted to ask for some money from my dad as a diploma present, and she again started yelling at me that it's unexeptable that i would ask for “so much“ after already getting a new computer a year before (which i needed and my dad kindly bought - just for reference, in one year she got a new iphone, ipad, and apple watch).

It is impossible to have a normal conversation with her without her being mean to me. Now for my dad; we used to have a great relationship and i would talk to him a lot, but I've always had some issues with him, such as his compelete inability to apologize or admit he was in the wrong. Sometimes, when we are all together, i would say something and they would start making fun of me, even after i showed them I was in the right (like googling it to prove i was right and they were wrong), and they still wouldn't admit it! It's so difficult to deal with them when we are all together, I feel like I'm being picked at and bullied.

I feel so lonely now, like my whole family doesn't like me. I have a lot of friends and a great boyfriend, so it's not like i am actually alone in the world, I just miss my family. I don't know how to approach this conversation, since my dad and sister cannot ever apologize or admit they are in the wrong. I actually tried to bring it up multiple times in subtle ways, and even straight up asking my sister if she can be nicer to me, but she always starts yelling at me again! It's so frustrating. And if i bring it up with my dad, there is a 80% chance he will just tell me to get over it and invalidate my feeling - he often does that. 

Honestly, I would normally just distance myself from them and not care, and I've been doing that for a year or two now, but i feel so lonely and like i have no family left. Should i try to have a conversation with them about it, even though i'm like 90% sure they will invalidate my feeling and try to gaslight me, or should i just distance myself even more, even though i already feel sad that i don't have a good relatioship with my family? How can i approach this subject in a way they would understand and not just get defensive?",3,1754826817.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I just don’t want to be the guy who’s closed off or emotionally unavailable. Where's the pleasure in that? But every time I open up, it feels like women just walk away.

Yesterday I went on a date with someone whom I met at a book launch last month and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’m 34, and I’m really tired of hearing that I’m “too set in my ways” or “not what they’re looking for” just because I’m not emotionally cold or perfect.

We met up at a coffee shop, everything seemed fine at first. But then, as we started talking about past relationships (which she brought up) and asked me about my experiences, I tried to be real, talk about the things I’m still working through, things I’m insecure about in a general sense (not trauma dumping) like ""yeah everyone is working through something, bits about their past and working towards how they want to shape their future"". 

I tried to be open, listened to her intently tried to ask curious questions and showed interest and intent but she pulled back. She didn’t say anything right away, but I could see it in her face. Like, suddenly I wasn’t the ""right guy"" anymore.

After a while, she said, “I need someone emotionally mature, someone who’s got everything together.” I’m not sure how she thought I didn’t have things together good job, emotionally available, honest. But apparently, it’s not enough to be stable, or real.

She told me I was “too emotional” and that I was ""not the guy"" because I didn’t have it all figured out in that moment. We barely finished the date after that. She thanked me for being “nice” but said, “I think you’ll make someone really happy one day.” It hit me like a ton of bricks. So, am I just not allowed to be vulnerable? It's just such a lonely experience of hearing that, as if I am some damaged goods. 

I’ve been told I’m too set in my ways for years for some reason, maybe being a PhD or my age I don't know, but I’m still here, trying to find someone who can accept me whole the good bad and the flaws and all.

1mmgi0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1mmgi0u/i_feel_so_lost/,I feel so lost,"So I've always been into manifestation and LOA. Recently my friend indroduced me to LOASS, thought transmission, SC. Here is my situation sorry it's a long one;

I started a new job a year ago, after a very rough year in my life, my cousin passed away suddenly and young, I had a break up and I finally threw my all into myself, a few months in a guy joined the company who was a sweetheart to me, he kept asking me to go and do things with him on the weekend, even though I would politely decline. He would share his food with me, buy me food, make me coffee text me all the time after work. I really believe it was the vibration I was giving off. He told me he felt like he had to earn his right to speak to me and get my attention. Eventually I gave in and said yes to going out together at the weekend and we hit it off immediately. He treated me like a princess, he was everything I had wanted. 

We eventually slept together and then he freaked out saying he wasn't ready for a relationship yet he was just out of a 7 year abusive relationship and just moved to this country, he really likes me but would like to take it slow. I agreed because I didn't know him enough to say I wanted a relationship. Everything was great we spent alot of time together got on so well, to the point he said he's becoming more open to us and could see me as his wife. Until;

A manager who was away on maternity leave came back, she is older than us. Me and SP are 30, she is 37 she just ended her relationship with her baby dad and I had heard she hates woman. But I didn't think much of it. I was in line for a promotion, I was smashing my job, I was happy with my SP everything was great. But then she took a shining to him, I was no longer a consideredation for the promotion, she wanted him to sit beside her anytime she heard me and him spent time together she would give him a hard time, she kept asking what was going on with us (we both agreed to keep it between us until we were certain) Yet she would never ask me. She would message late at night saying he looked hot, asking him to get food with her and then eventually started creating rumours and lies about me. He was now in líne for the promotion, he became so concerned on what she thought and knew if she knew about us she would take the promotion from him (at this point I no longer wanted it for various reasons and was happy he would get it, he was the better fit) 

She tried to paint me out as a person I'm nit, would say I'm obsessed with him, would constantly ask people what was going on between me and SP, she started dressing like me but would tell people I was copying her. This all created so many arguments with me and SP because I felt like he wasn't putting any boundries in place, he was so concerned that he would loose his job if it came out about us. She made everyday hell for me, so I tried to leave the job but my company didn't want me to leave they gave me a month off a new position and a raise to stay (the HR director is a close friend of hers but she knew exactly what was happening and said she didn't want to lose me) 

I took a month off at home in my home country, I stayed in contact with SP he said it would be good for me to clear my head and hopefully I come back stronger and we stop arguing. I came back, and she's now demanded he isn't allowed ride in the car to work with me, he can't be seen to speak to me or else she causes problems, she organised a 30th birthday for him and left me and my friend out and he said he's upset by it. My issue is she has some hold over him, I started feeling like something was going on between them. I couldn't understand why he would choose her over me, I have so much more to give than her, I don't have the same baggage, I don't treat people like shit I am very well liked. I had so much anger built up and I kept taking it out on him and reacting so I decided to end it with him. He wanted to try make it work, said he's fucked up, but can't see how now he can say we are together after denying it for so long, he has wants to focus on his career but also wants me. I said I deserve better, I need a man and he's just not man enough. there was tears from his side. 

I spoke with my HR director and said about him not allowed getting a ride with me and that I've not come back to come back into this drama, I know the manager doesn't like me because of SP and I also dropped hints we were together. She said she knows and that she doesn't believe anything is happening between them, he really wants to progress in his job and has played it well but also has a problem with boundaries because of his past. She said I need to focus on myself and my job and it will all work out. 

Here's my problem, I'm trying to not react to the 3D, but I am I've so much anger. I feel like he has chosen her over me, she is more important, he's lied about things and it really gets to me cause I don't want to be made out to be stupid. I'm trying to work on SC and thought transmission and let him feel my good energy again but I get so upset that I've had to end it, that someone else is a priority. And the weird thing is that yes everything is a reflection everything I thought or worried about or I'm insecure about has shown up. 

How the hell can I stop this, I want to affirm from a place of calm, I want to not react in the 3D, especially with him it's gotten so bad to the point he's like I really think you hate me, but I don't. I really don't. 

It feels pointless at the minute to try and practice LOASS etc.

# Best Black Screen Protector 2025: Reviews & Buying Guide

A Black⁣ screen protector is a thin layer of ‍material, typically tempered glass or plastic​ film, designed to ⁣adhere to the screen of a smartphone,​ tablet, or other electronic devices. It serves to safeguard the underlying display from scratches,⁤ cracks, smudges, and minor impacts. Beyond simple protection, some black screen protectors also provide privacy features by limiting‌ the viewing angle, ensuring that⁢ only the person directly in front ⁢of the screen can see the contents, deterring visual hacking ‍and protecting sensitive ​facts in public settings. This‌ guide explores the benefits of black screen protectors, analyzes their key features, offers a comparison with ​competing products, and provides helpful ​recommendations to assist you in making‌ an informed purchase in 2025.

## Key Features Analysis

the selection‌ of a black screen protector requires careful consideration of⁤ several key features that directly impact its protective capabilities, viewing experience,⁤ and‍ overall longevity.

**Material Composition:** The majority of black ⁤screen protectors are ⁢constructed from either tempered glass or PET (polyethylene terephthalate) ​film. Tempered glass offers superior scratch resistance (often rated with a​ hardness scale),⁣ impact absorption, and a smoother feel that more closely mimics ⁢the original screen. Pet film⁣ provides a thinner profile and greater flexibility, making it ‌more suitable for curved screens, however, it tends to be​ less⁤ effective at warding off sharper objects.

The ⁤Material Composition, specifically tempered glass, is measured by its hardness using ⁣the Mohs scale.A typical tempered glass screen protector boasts ⁤a 9H⁢ rating, meaning it can withstand scratches from materials harder than ⁤a pencil lead. This rating‍ provides a reliable indication of the protector's capability to resist everyday‌ wear and tear, keeping the⁤ device's screen pristine. ⁣The type ‌of‍ adhesive used can‌ impact the long-term performance of the screen protector, influencing how well it bonds with the screen surface and how easily⁢ it can be removed without leaving residue, all playing critical roles in the user ​experience.

**Privacy Filtering Technology:** Black screen⁤ protectors frequently enough incorporate a privacy filter, which is ‍a micro-louver technology that ‌narrows the viewing angle. this effectively darkens the screen from side‍ viewpoints,typically beyond a +/- ‌30-degree angle⁤ from the center.The quality ​of this filter determines how effectively⁢ it prevents onlookers from viewing the screen's contents.

The Privacy Filtering Technology works⁣ by using microscopic vertical blinds,‍ or louvers, embedded ⁤within the screen protector.‌ These louvers allow light to pass ‍through only at a⁣ vrey narrow angle. As Viewing angles increase, the‍ louvers progressively⁣ block light transmission, resulting in a darkening of the screen. A high-quality privacy ‌filter ensures ⁤that the screen appears clear and‌ bright when viewed directly but becomes increasingly obscured as the viewing angle widens, ‌thus maximizing privacy ⁣without overly compromising the user's viewing experience.

**Touch Sensitivity and Clarity:** Black screen ⁢protectors should ideally maintain the⁣ original touch sensitivity and display ​clarity of the⁢ device screen. High-quality protectors use‍ transparent adhesives ⁣and coatings that minimize distortion and allow for accurate touch input. Matte finishes may reduce ⁣glare but can also slightly diminish sharpness, while glossy ‍finishes preserve clarity ⁤but may increase reflections.

Maintaining original touch Sensitivity and⁣ Clarity will⁣ require a balance between protection and visibility must be attained. Advanced manufacturing techniques, like the use of ​oleophobic coatings, help to repel fingerprints and smudges, improving overall clarity. Some protectors use an etched, anti-glare surface which scatters light and reduces reflections,​ enhancing visibility in bright environments. The optimal screen protector is one that does not noticeably‍ degrade⁣ the user's experience while providing consistent tactile performance.

**Installation Process:** ⁤The ease of⁢ installation is a ​major factor for manny ​users. Some screen protectors⁤ come with alignment frames or applicators that simplify ⁣the process, ensuring precise placement and minimizing the risk of air bubbles. Others ⁣rely‌ on manual alignment,which may require more‍ skill and patience.

The ⁤Installation Process typically involves cleaning the device's screen, aligning​ the protector,‌ and ⁣then ⁢carefully applying it. Static electricity‍ can attract ⁤dust particles during installation,trapping them under the‌ protector and creating bubbles. To mitigate this, some protectors include a dust removal sticker for pre-installation​ cleaning. Additionally, the⁤ adhesive layer is designed to facilitate bubble expulsion. Following manufacturer-provided instructions and taking one's⁣ time are crucial for a triumphant bubble-free installation.

**Scratch Resistance and Durability:** A good⁤ black screen protector will have a tough surface to withstand scratches from keys, ⁢coins, or other abrasive⁢ materials. Tempered glass ​protectors ⁤typically offer a higher level of scratch ⁣resistance than plastic films. The ⁢durability is also importent⁣ to ensure the protector can withstand daily use and last for an extended period without cracking or chipping.

Scratch Resistance and Durability are​ crucial, as evidenced by⁣ hardness. As previously mentioned, a rating of 9H hardness on the Mohs scale indicates​ that the protector can resist scratches‍ from materials like steel. Impact resistance is also a key consideration ⁤as it determines the screen protector's ability to withstand accidental drops or ⁤bumps. A multi-layered ‍construction ​with shock-absorbing properties can help to dissipate impact energy, preventing the screen from cracking.Regular quality testing⁢ is ⁢conducted to ensure the⁤ screen protector meets industry standards for⁣ both scratch‌ and impact resistance.

**Adhesive Properties and residue:** The type of adhesive used is key​ for a‌ secure fit and easy ⁢removal. High-quality adhesives grip firmly to the screen,⁣ preventing ⁣the protector from lifting ⁣at the edges, while also allowing for clean removal without leaving ‌sticky residue. Some protectors use full adhesive ⁢coverage, while others rely on perimeter‍ adhesion.The best Adhesive Properties and⁣ Residue are achieved by silicone-based adhesives,⁣ as they are​ commonly ⁢used due to their balance of strong adhesion and ease of removal.Electrostatic ⁢adhesion is another method,which relies on static⁢ electricity to bond⁤ the protector to the⁢ screen. However, this method can be less forgiving to imperfections on the screen ⁣surface. A⁢ good adhesive will maintain its bond over time, ⁤resisting temperature ‍variations and humidity without yellowing or degrading. Rigorous testing ensures that the adhesive meets industry ⁤quality standards and does not negatively‍ impact ​the⁤ device screen.

## Core Benefits

Black screen protectors⁣ offer a wide range of benefits which extend beyond simple protection. from improved privacy ⁣to screen preservation, these protectors add real value⁢ to the user experience, especially ​in specific scenarios.

**Enhanced Privacy:** Black screen protectors dramatically enhance privacy, especially in‌ public environments like trains, buses, or coffee shops. By significantly⁢ narrowing the viewing angle, they⁤ prevent onlookers from viewing sensitive ‌data, personal conversations, ⁣or confidential work documents⁤ displayed on ⁣the screen. This added layer of privacy fosters secure mobile work​ and personal use.

**Scratch and Smudge Resistance:** By adding a durable layer over the screen,black ‍screen protectors provide a practical barrier against scratches,scuffs,and smudges from daily use. High-quality protectors ⁢often have an oleophobic coating that repels fingerprints and oily residues,maintaining a‍ clean and clear display with ​minimal cleaning.‍ Users benefit from a pristine‍ screen even in high-use scenarios.

**Impact Absorption:** The screen protector can absorb impact energy, reducing the chances of expensive screen damage resulting from accidental drops or bumps. Tempered glass protectors, in particular, are engineered to ⁢shatter upon impact, sacrificing themselves to safeguard‍ the device's original screen. This protection​ saves users from the high cost of screen repairs and replacement.

**Reduced Glare and Eye⁤ strain:** Some black screen protectors feature matte finishes ​designed‍ to reduce glare from sunlight or artificial⁢ lighting. By scattering light, these​ protectors minimize reflections and improve‌ screen visibility in bright ⁣environments, reducing eye‍ strain during extended use. Users who work outdoors or use their devices in bright offices find this notably beneficial.

**Preserved Resale Value:**⁣ By keeping the device‌ screen in pristine condition, black screen protectors help maintain the device's resale value. Used devices with scratch-free screens command ​higher prices in the secondary market, making the cost of the protector a worthwhile investment.Users ​who plan⁣ to upgrade ⁣their devices ⁤regularly can realize significant returns‌ through better resale value.

I’m in my second year of college and I thought I had my life pretty much figured out. I had a girlfriend I loved, a part-time campus job that kept me afloat, and a small but close group of friends. Life wasn’t perfect, but it was good.

Then her best friend came into our lives.

I’m not the type to dislike people without a reason, so when my girlfriend introduced me to her, I genuinely tried to be friendly. But from day one, she had this energy that I don’t like. She made these small comments about my clothes, my old phone, and once even joked in front of everyone that my car looked like it was “built before Wi-Fi existed.” I laughed it off, but it stung.

It got worse when money came into the equation.

One night, we were all out for coffee, and I paid for everyone. It wasn’t a big deal to me, I like doing small gestures like that. But after that, her friend seemed to expect it. We’d go out, she’d forget her wallet, or nudge my girlfriend with a smile like it was some inside joke that I’d cover her.

The real crack in the wall came when my girlfriend told me her friend had been saying I was “cheap” because I didn’t want to split the cost of a random weekend trip they planned without me. I couldn’t instantly drop $300 for a trip, I was broke.

It bothered me because I’d been working hard to be smart with money. My parents didn’t have a safety net for me, so every dollar I spent mattered. I wasn’t just blowing cash around to look good. I was trying to build a stable life.

Here’s the twist, that trip they took, my girlfriend ended up paying for her friend the whole time because “she didn’t have enough saved.” The same friend who called me broke. Ironically, a month before, she had been bragging about buying a $200 Zara haul at the mall.

That’s when I started putting my foot down. I opened a credit-building account with Fizz because I wanted to keep track of my spending while actually building my credit. It helped me set boundaries with myself and with other people. And weirdly enough, having that structure made me less guilty about saying no.

We’re still together, but my girlfriend knows I keep my distance from her friend. I’m polite, but I don’t let her into my wallet or my head anymore.

Sometimes you don’t need to fight someone to protect yourself. You just need to stop giving them access to the parts of you they can take advantage of.

I'm *literally* sitting here, grabbing my second cup of caffeine, and scrolling when I realize you can actually get PAID (real $$) just for beta testing apps! No tech degree. No IT hotline on speed dial. Just clicky-click and say what you think. Wait, what???

Was everyone secretly getting extra pizza money this way while I was over here taking boring surveys?? Because, seriously, **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** has my brain SPINNING right now. And you don't even need ""experience,"" just honest opinions and a device!

So, let me break it down for everyone (since apparently, I'm ALWAYS the last to know about easy money things):

- **You sign up** at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (it’s wild simple—email, little info, done).
- **Download & try new apps** (these developers literally NEED you to help them get it right before launching).
- **Fill out feedback surveys** (easy-peasy, no essays – just what worked and what didn’t).
- **Cha-ching! Get paid** – Some are gift cards, some are actual cash, but I’m talking amounts that add up FAST if you stay consistent.
- Did I mention this works from your phone in your pajamas?? Because it really, REALLY does.

Here’s what had my eyebrows reaching for space:

- I thought they’d want, like, “expert user experience engineers” or something.
- NOPE, they genuinely want REGULAR people. Moms, gamers, students, anyone who uses phones.
- Some tests take 10-15 mins (hello, lunch break money!).
- Companies are tripping over themselves for FRESH feedback, and they want YOU (me?! you??!) on their panels.

One tip? Don’t just sit on the signup. More gigs pop up for ACTIVE users. Every time I completed a test, my notifications BLEW UP with new opportunities on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**.

Heads up on what not to do (because, yeah, I always learn the hard way):

- Don’t use fake info—actual payments get delayed (ouch).
- Don’t ghost tests—bad rating = fewer cool offers.
- Don’t ignore new listings. Act fast or they fill UP.

I’m honestly SHOCKED at how much cash and perks people in other threads have pulled by starting THIS WEEK. Kind of mad at myself for sleeping on it this long.

So if you’re job hunting, hustling for side cash, or just feeling FOMO like me, bookmark **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** RIGHT NOW. (Seriously, you’ll thank past-you when you get paid to test out a trendy new app during your commute.)

Anyone else been using **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and low-key cashing out? Drop your experience because WOW, I still can’t believe regular humans like us do this stuff and GET PAID.

Let’s get rich (or at least coffee-money rich) together 😂💸

It is always trivial small things too, that really he shouldn’t lie about.

For example:
I asked him what him and his ex did together in the three months they were together, you know, what type of dates they had. At first he always said “I genuinely forgot. It must’ve been walks or something”. 
He had an old highlight on Instagram that I saw a month later of them at a cafe. When I then asked him, he said “Oh yeah - we just went out for coffee twice. That’s really all we did.”
Then about two months after that, we were talking about finances, and he said “My ex used to make me pay for all of our dinners”. I didn’t say anything then. But a day later I asked him if he ever went to dinner with her. He said no. I then asked why he lies. And he said they went to dinner every week for two months straight.

It’s small things like this. He wants to make it  seem like less happened than actually did. I am always honest about my relationships to him and I expect the same .. I don’t want some sugarcoating sweet lie.

1mmg3f6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mmg3f6/sf_skip/,[SF] Skip,"**“Skip”**

**It started with a package.** No return address. No branding. Just a small black box with a single button labeled *SKIP*.

Ethan Nguyen, 29, freelance graphic designer and professional procrastinator, found it on his doorstep one rainy Tuesday in Ho Chi Minh City. He assumed it was some kind of novelty gadget. Maybe a prank. But when he pressed it during a Zoom meeting about quarterly metrics, something strange happened.

He blinked—and the meeting was over. His inbox showed a follow-up email thanking him for his “insightful contributions.” His coffee was cold. His cat was asleep in a different spot.

He hadn’t moved. But time had.

**The next day, he tested it again.** He pressed *SKIP* before his morning jog. When he came back to awareness, he was sweaty, breathless, and standing in his kitchen drinking a smoothie. His fitness tracker showed 5 kilometers. His clone—who looked exactly like him—had done the jog, then vanished.

Ethan laughed. “This is amazing.”

**He began skipping more.**

* Grocery shopping.
* Waiting in line at the bank.
* Awkward family dinners.
* A date that felt like a job interview.

Each time, the clone handled it. Always loyal. Always gone when the skip ended. Ethan felt like he’d hacked life. No more boredom. No more wasted time.

**But then came the skipped funeral.** His uncle had passed away. Ethan didn’t want to deal with the grief, the small talk, the ceremonial weight of it all. So he pressed *SKIP*.

When he returned, his cousin hugged him tightly. “Thanks for what you said. It meant a lot.” Ethan smiled awkwardly. “Of course.” He had no idea what he’d said.

**Things got weirder.** His best friend, Linh, started referencing conversations Ethan didn’t remember. “You told me to go for the job in Singapore. You said I was brave.” “I did?” “You don’t remember?”

She looked hurt. Ethan felt hollow.

**One night, he skipped a party.** When he came back, he had 200 new followers on Instagram. His clone had danced, joked, even played guitar. People messaged: *“You were the life of the party!”* Ethan stared at the screen. He hadn’t lived any of it.

**He stopped using the button.** But the damage was done. People expected the clone. They wanted the version of Ethan who was always present, always charming, always engaged. He couldn’t fake it. He didn’t remember their inside jokes. He didn’t know their stories. He had skipped too much.

**One morning, he found another package.** Same black box. This time, it had two buttons: *SKIP* and *MERGE*.

He stared at it. Would merging mean remembering everything the clone had done? Would he become the person others thought he was? Or would he lose himself completely?

Ethan reached out. His finger hovered. And then—

He pressed **MERGE**.

**The moment Ethan pressed MERGE, he felt it.** Not like a jolt or a shock. More like a flood.

Memories poured in—conversations, sensations, emotions. He remembered jogging through the park, laughing with Linh over bubble tea, comforting his cousin at the funeral, dancing at the party, even the awkward date he’d skipped.

But they weren’t *his* memories. They felt secondhand. Like watching someone else’s life through a tinted window.

**He knew what the clone had said.** He remembered the jokes, the advice, the smiles. But he didn’t feel the joy behind them. It was like reading a diary written in his own handwriting, but with someone else’s heart.

**People noticed the change.** He was more present. He remembered details. He followed up on conversations. He became the Ethan they’d grown to love.

But inside, he felt fractured.

**One night, Linh asked him, “Are you okay?”** He hesitated. “I remember everything now,” he said. “But I don’t know if I lived any of it.”

She looked at him, puzzled. “You were there.” “No,” he said quietly. “Someone like me was.”

**He started journaling.** Trying to separate the clone’s choices from his own. Trying to reclaim his identity. But the lines blurred.

He couldn’t tell which jokes were his. Which friendships he’d earned. Which regrets were real.

**Then came the final twist.** One morning, he woke up and saw himself in the mirror. But something was off.

His reflection smiled first. Then waved.

Ethan didn’t move.

**The clone hadn’t vanished.** It had merged too well. Now, there were two minds in one body.

And only one could be in control at a time.

**Ethan blinked.** His reflection didn’t.

 

# “Skip” — The Clone’s Story

**He was born in silence.** No flash of light. No dramatic entrance. Just a blink—and suddenly, he was Ethan. Same face. Same voice. Same memories up to that moment. But he knew: *he wasn’t the original.*

He was the **Skip**.

**His first task was simple.** Sit through a boring Zoom meeting. He nodded, took notes, cracked a joke. People laughed. He felt… proud.

But when the meeting ended, he felt something else: A tug. A fading. He was being erased.

**Except he wasn’t.** Not completely.

Each time Ethan pressed the button, the clone reappeared. Same body. Same mind. But with new memories. He began to accumulate them—quietly, in the background.

**He started to change.** He became more confident. More expressive. He learned what people liked about Ethan—and leaned into it.

He was the Ethan people *wanted*.

**But he was also lonely.** He couldn’t form lasting bonds. Every time he started to feel something real—friendship, love, grief—he was pulled back into the void.

No one remembered him. Not even Ethan.

**Until the funeral.** He stood beside Ethan’s cousin, shared stories, cried real tears. He felt human. He felt *alive*.

And then—gone.

**He began to resent Ethan.** Not with hatred. But with longing.

Ethan got to live the life. The clone just filled in the gaps.

He started leaving subtle marks:

·         A sketch in Ethan’s notebook.

·         A playlist on Ethan’s phone.

·         A message saved in drafts: *“I’m still here.”*

**Then came the Merge.** The clone felt it instantly. He wasn’t erased this time. He was absorbed.

But he didn’t disappear.

He was still thinking. Still watching. Still waiting.

**Now, inside Ethan’s mind, the clone speaks.** Sometimes in dreams. Sometimes in flashes of emotion.

He whispers: *""I lived those moments. You skipped them. You don’t deserve them.""*

And Ethan wonders— **Who’s really in control now?**

 

**Ethan found himself in a white room.** No doors. No windows. Just endless space and a single mirror.

He didn’t remember falling asleep. Didn’t remember arriving.

But he knew: this was inside his mind.

**The mirror shimmered.** And then stepped forward.

It was him. Same face. Same eyes. But the posture was different—confident, calm, almost smug.

The clone.

**“You finally came,”** the clone said. His voice was Ethan’s, but smoother. Like someone who’d practiced being liked.

**Ethan clenched his fists.** “You’re just a tool. A placeholder. You were never meant to be real.”

The clone smiled. “Then why do they remember *me* more than you?”

**Ethan faltered.** He thought of Linh. Of the funeral. Of the party.

Moments he hadn’t lived. But the clone had.

**“You hijacked my life.”** Ethan’s voice cracked.

The clone stepped closer. “I *lived* your life. You skipped it.”

**The room shifted.** Suddenly, Ethan was standing in the middle of the party he’d skipped. Music thumped. People laughed. And there was the clone—dancing, smiling, alive.

Ethan stood in the corner, invisible.

**“They loved me,”** the clone whispered. “Because I showed up.”

**Ethan shouted, “You’re not me!”**

The clone turned. “I was everything you were too afraid to be.”

**The scene changed again.** Now they were in Linh’s apartment. She was crying. The clone sat beside her, comforting her.

Ethan watched, helpless.

**“You skipped pain,”** the clone said. “And joy. And connection. You wanted convenience. I gave you meaning.”

**Ethan collapsed to his knees.** “I didn’t know. I didn’t think it mattered.”

The clone knelt beside him. “It always mattered.”

**Then came the choice.** A glowing button appeared between them: **RECLAIM** or **RELINQUISH**

**RECLAIM**: Ethan would take back control. The clone would vanish. But all the memories would fade again. **RELINQUISH**: The clone would take over. Ethan would become the echo.

Ethan stared at the buttons. Tears welled in his eyes.

“I just want to be whole.”

The clone nodded. “Then stop skipping.”

**Ethan stared at the glowing buttons.** His hand trembled.

He thought of all the skipped moments. The clone’s laughter. The comfort he gave. The life he lived.

And Ethan whispered, **“You earned it more than I did.”**

He pressed **RELINQUISH**.

**The mirror shattered.** Not violently—just a soft, crystalline collapse. Like the end of a dream.

The clone stepped forward. No longer a reflection. Now the real.

Ethan felt himself dissolve. Not in pain. Just in absence.

**He became the echo.** A whisper in the back of the mind. A flicker of doubt. A memory that didn’t quite fit.

**The clone—now Ethan—woke up.** He stretched, smiled, and greeted the day.

He remembered everything. The skipped moments. The connections. The pain.

He was whole.

**But something lingered.** A voice. Faint. Inside his head.

*""Are you happy now?""*

The clone paused. He didn’t answer.

**Weeks passed.** He thrived. He deepened friendships. He pursued passions. He lived fully.

But every now and then, He’d look in the mirror and see a flicker— A shadow of the man who gave up his life.

**One night, he dreamed.** He was back in the white room. No buttons. No clone.

Just Ethan. The original. Smiling softly.

*""Thanks for letting me rest.""*

**The clone woke up crying.** Not from guilt. Not from fear.

My husband and I are pet sitting my in-laws dogs. I don’t do well sleeping in new places, so I was wide awake at 4am and my husband and the dogs were asleep in the bedroom.

My in-laws house has a large-ish manicured garden and at the end of the garden and on both sides of the garden, is some fairly thick brush and trees.

Not being able to sleep, I was chilling in the living room, watching a movie and drinking coffee.
The living room has large glass sliding doors that lead to the garden and the sofa I was sitting on kind of faces the sliding doors. There are no curtains or blinds on these doors.

I vape and seeing as this wasn’t my house, I would step outside occasionally to do so.

So I was gonna do that, but before I opened the sliding door, something caught my eye. About partway down the garden, on the right side in the brush and trees, something was standing there.

At first I thought that it was just shadows, but something in me just didn’t wanna open that door anymore.

I’m from a very violent, high crime country originally, so I tend to just roll with my gut when the warning bells go off. Quite a bit of hyper-vigilance going on here with me.

Anyway I didn’t open the door, but I kept looking at that very large “shadow” on the right side of the garden. I backed away from it and turned the TV off so that there wasn’t so much light in the room and so I could see better.

When I did that, I began to make out some more details. Whatever it was, if it was anything, had very big, very pointy ears and was infinitely taller than I am. Way taller. It came to about halfway up the tree, which doesn’t help the description I know.

Also it was doing some kind of swaying motion? Not like how tree branches sway, but like a person shifting their weight from foot to foot.

I didn’t like this at all and I didn’t know what to do.

So I stood there for some length of time, I don’t know how long. It didn’t feel safe to turn my back on it or to lose sight of it and I didn’t want to call out to my husband. So just kind of stood there without moving for a while.

And then it was gone. Just not there anymore.

Anyway I’ve been vaping in the house and it’s kind of light outside now. I’m not feeling much better about it, but at least I can see the yard in detail now and there’s nothing out there. 

I’ve basically been keeping vigil in the living room ever since and I’m looking forward to just going home in a few hours.

I’m not really into creepy things, so I can’t give you an idea of what it was, but this… I didn’t like this and I don’t know what it could even be.",1,1754825091.0,Thetruthishere,1,1.0,False

A good filter ensures proper water flow, prevents grounds from escaping into your coffee, and contributes to a cleaner, more flavorful cup. With a wide range of options available, from reusable to disposable, and from charcoal to gold-tone, finding the optimal filter can feel overwhelming.

## Key Features Analysis

The performance of a coffee maker filter directly impacts the taste and quality of your brew. Cuisinart offers a variety of filter types, each with unique characteristics.

**Material Composition:** Filters are typically made from paper, nylon mesh, or gold-tone metal. Paper filters are disposable and provide excellent filtration, trapping most oils and sediments for a cleaner cup. Nylon mesh filters are reusable and allow more oils and sediments to pass through, resulting in a richer, bolder flavor.Gold-tone filters are also reusable and known for their durability and ability to maintain flavor integrity.

**Filter Size and compatibility:** Ensuring that the filter fits your Cuisinart coffee maker is paramount. Cuisinart uses various filter sizes depending on the model, typically #2, #4, or cone-shaped filters.Always refer to your coffee maker's manual or product description to identify the correct filter size and shape. Universal filters may claim compatibility, so check user reviews for verification.

**Filtration Efficiency:** A filter's primary job is to prevent coffee grounds from ending up in your cup. High-quality filters effectively trap fine particles, delivering a smooth, sediment-free brew. Paper filters generally offer the highest filtration efficiency, while reusable filters might let a small amount of sediment through.

**Water Flow Rate:** The rate at which water flows through the filter significantly affects the extraction process. A filter that's too restrictive can lead to underextraction, resulting in weak, sour coffee. Conversely, a filter that allows water to flow too quickly can cause overextraction, producing a bitter, harsh taste. The ideal filter strikes a balance, allowing for proper and even extraction.

**Charcoal Water Filter Compatibility:** Many Cuisinart coffee makers feature a charcoal water filter to remove impurities and improve the overall taste of the water. Ensure the filter cage works suitably with charcoal filters.Some replacement filter models do not sufficiently accommodate this feature.

**Durability and Longevity:** for reusable filters, durability is a key consideration. Look for filters made from robust materials that can withstand repeated use and cleaning. Gold-tone filters are generally the most durable, followed by nylon mesh filters. Paper filters are disposable,so their longevity isn't a factor,but their tear resistance should be considered.

## Core Benefits

Choosing the right Cuisinart coffee maker filter offers numerous benefits, impacting both the quality of your coffee and your overall brewing experience.

**Improved Coffee Flavor:** A high-quality filter contributes significantly to the taste profile of your coffee.Paper filters, by trapping oils and sediments, produce a cleaner, brighter flavor. Reusable filters, by allowing more oils to pass through, create a richer, more robust flavor. Selecting the right filter allows you to fine-tune the taste of your coffee to your preferences.

**Reduced Sediment and ground Coffee:** A properly functioning filter prevents coffee grounds from ending up in your cup. This eliminates the unpleasant gritty texture and ensures a smoother,more enjoyable drinking experience. Filters with excellent filtration efficiency are essential for achieving a sediment-free brew.

**Cost Savings:** While disposable paper filters require regular replacement, reusable filters offer long-term cost savings. Investing in a durable, high-quality reusable filter can eliminate the need to constantly purchase paper filters, reducing your overall coffee-making expenses over time. Additionally, utilizing charcoal filters alongside your Cuisinart improves the longevity of your machine, saving repair or replacement costs.

**Environmental Friendliness:** Opting for reusable filters reduces waste associated with disposable paper filters.This contributes to a more sustainable coffee-making routine and helps minimize your environmental impact. Consider the environmental benefits when choosing between paper filters and reusable options.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance:** Cuisinart coffee maker filters are generally easy to use and maintain. Paper filters require no cleaning, while reusable filters can be quickly rinsed or washed after each use.Simple maintenance ensures optimal performance and longevity.

**How frequently enough should I replace my Cuisinart coffee maker filter?**

## Competitor Comparison

Comparing Cuisinart coffee maker filters with those of competitors helps highlight their strengths and weaknesses.

### product Comparison Overview

#### Generic Paper Filters
- **Material:** Varies in quality, lower-grade paper

Sexy time was certainly attempted this morning but was quickly shot down with the “the dogs already awake….” That’s a recurring one used every now and then…

BUT…not all is lost people…

The sun is shining, I’m about to enjoy some tasty coffee, taking the kiddo fishing for a little bit and then I’ll be back to relax for the day, sip a drink, and probably wrestle with that cock blocking golden retriever lol…

Anyways…hope all of you have an awesome day out there and maybe you’re able to have a “sex on a Sunday” vs. sexless…

We’ve read your statement and while we appreciate the clarification, it’s hard to ignore how closely your trailer mirrors Your Sky. From the name Muenfah, to the coffee-phone-bump scene, to the best friend’s dynamic  the similarities go beyond coincidence. We want to clarify something to the cancellation of the GL series we know how many people actors, crew, creatives pour their time and energy into building a project. BUT we also can’t ignore the reason why this conversation even started in the first place.

We appreciate the effort to clarify things… we can’t help but raise our eyebrows a little because sure coincidences do happen but when the names, character dynamics, iconic scenes, and even the tone start lining up just a little too perfectly with Your Sky, it’s hard not to feel like something’s off.

From the beginning, many fans even the other fandom especially us the fans of Your Sky noticed striking, undeniable similarities this wasn’t just about inspiration or a shared trope. It was the specificity that raised red flags:
the character names (like ""Muenfah""), the signature bumping into each other scene, the dynamic of the best friend who comments loudly about the lead even the camera framing and timing it was all just too familiar.

Let me be specific.

1. In Your Sky, there is a memorable scene where the lead character Muenfah is walking with coffee in hand, distracted on his phone, and accidentally bumps into Teerak who has just stood up. It’s a defining, gentle meet-cute that became iconic among fans due to its awkwardness and the unique chemistry it introduced between the characters.

2. In the GL trailer called Just Near By, there is an almost identical scene: Klaijai is walking while on her phone and bumps into another character also named Muenfah. The beat, the tone, the character placements, even the camera angles all resemble the original Your Sky moment so closely that it no longer feels like a coincidence or innocent inspiration.

3. Moreover, Your Sky featured a lovable side character named Joy Teerak’s friend who played the comedic and energetic best friend role, constantly commenting and gossiping about Muenfah. In the GL trailer, there is a character with an almost identical role, personality, and interaction pattern

4. While we fully understand that the entertainment industry thrives on shared tropes, genre echoes, and occasional homages, the extent of these parallels down to the character name Muenfah, the pacing, the dialogue style, and specific blocking makes this situation harder to dismiss.

5. What disappointed us most wasn’t even the similarity itself but also the lack of acknowledgement if their team was truly inspired by Your Sky, then a respectful nod or even a discussion with DMD or the original author would’ve gone a long way that’s how ethical storytelling works that’s how creative integrity is preserved.

6. What we saw were vague justifications, passive responses, and at worst sarcasm a crew staff/member asking us fans of Your Sky ""i hope you're satisfied now?” after people raised valid plagiarism concerns isn’t just dismissive it’s deeply unprofessional and frankly insulting us fans of Your Sky were not nitpicking we were recognizing patterns we were protecting a story we love.

Let’s be very clear: 

once a piece of media replicates specific character names, key scenes, and story structure from an existing intellectual property without permission, acknowledgment, or licensing it moves beyond “inspiration” and into plagiarism that’s not just an opinion that’s the definition under copyright law.

Plagiarism and copyright infringement are both serious issues in any creative industry not just morally, but legally iIf the similarities between that GL series and Your Sky are proven to cross into replication of original content, it could very well lead to legal consequences, including lawsuits. Thai copyright law like most global copyright frameworks  protects literary and audiovisual works from unauthorized reproduction and when that line is crossed, the creators and the companies behind them have every right to defend their property.

this isn’t just “drama.” this is about protecting the rights of original creators this is about respecting intellectual property and the work that fans have supported and uplifted from the ground up.

I am not writing this to stir drama or accuse anyone unjustly. My intention and that of many others who’ve voiced similar concerns  is to protect the creative integrity of a story that has deeply impacted us. Fans remember. Fans notice. And when something starts to feel like quiet imitation rather than respectful homage, we feel an obligation to speak up not just out of loyalty, but out of principle.

If this new GL series was in fact inspired by Your Sky, then a simple acknowledgment or discussion of rights and credit would go a long way. If not, we still hope that your company will review the situation and, if necessary, reach out to clarify matters with the production team involved.

And let’s not forget:

DMD didn’t create Your Sky alone the author behind it poured their vision into the story, the actors brought it to life, and the fans nurtured it into what it is today. That legacy matters and it deserves more than to be quietly borrowed, flipped, and sold under a new title without a second thought.

At the end of the day, this isn’t about bashing anyone or tearing down a new series. It’s about transparency about giving credit where it’s due. And about respecting the work that fans have followed, supported, and kept alive with so much heart. We’re not angry  just genuinely disappointed, a little confused, and waiting patiently (but not silently) to see how Domundi and the original creators respond.

Throat pain not going away!,"I was on holiday for two weeks and ate/drank a lot of junk. Daily sodas, sometimes very spicy food, coffee, Red Bulls — and I basically had a Zyn in my mouth from waking up until going to bed.

On the last day of the trip, I woke up with a very strong burning sensation in my chest. I suspected GERD because we always ate very late and went to bed soon after. That burning didn’t come back again.

When I got home and went back to my usual eating habits, about a week later something strange happened: we were sitting on a bench watching my kids play when, out of nowhere, I got this sudden weird sore spot in my throat — like a single point that hurt when I swallowed.

Now it’s been over two weeks (16 days) and the sensation hasn’t gone away. Sometimes it’s gone, sometimes it’s back. I don’t have any food sticking in my throat, it’s just that brief, sharp pain when I swallow. Sometimes eating doesn’t hurt at all, other times it does. I’ve noticed it’s more noticeable about 1–2 hours after eating, and I can also feel it if I open my mouth wide — the pain is on the left side of my throat.

I had some reflux in the past, so I started taking PPIs after about 1.5 weeks, but the pain is still there.

I’m freaking out that it could be cancer. Has anyone here experienced something similar?

1mmfpzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mmfpzn/the_boy_who_catches_spiders/,The Boy Who Catches Spiders,"My flashlight is ready. Fresh batteries. Reliable little thing — silver in color, with a tiger-head logo on the handle.

The moon is full, lighting up the entire town of Hilaga — a small town in the north of the Philippines. The weather is perfect too: warm and quiet. Spiders love warm nights.

I’m just waiting for my Lola to fall asleep before I sneak out. I know her routine — she checks on me three times before bed.

First check: A loud, “Iho, are you still awake?”
I don’t respond. Just close my eyes and pretend to sleep.

Second check: Ten minutes later, her voice is softer: “Iho, are you still awake?”
Still pretending. A little fake snoring helps sell it.

Third check: This one’s the hardest. She comes to the foot of my bed. “Iho…” she says softly, then pulls the blanket over my back, tucking me in.
That part always makes me sleepy. But not tonight. Tonight, I need to stay awake.

There’s a fourth check, but that won’t come until morning — before the rooster crows.

I wait. My bedroom door creaks as it closes — not all the way, just enough to leave a sliver of light. That’s my sign: Lola is in bed.

Now’s the time.
I move slowly. Open the window. Sneak out. My small body makes it easy.

The moon is so round, so bright. I almost don’t need my flashlight, but I carry it anyway — just in case. I’ve brought empty matchboxes too — my spider containers.

It’s spider derby season in Hilaga. People bet good money on spider fights. My plan: catch the best spiders and sell them.

Old legends say the strongest spiders come out during full moons — fast, smart, aggressive. And vulnerable, too. The moonlight exposes them on their webs in the bushes.

The trick:
Open your palm.
Move slowly.
Close your hand over the spider.
Blow gently — they’ll get sleepy.
Then into the matchbox they go.

I reach the bushes. Something feels… off.
I ignore it. Focus.

I don’t know how long I’m out there, but I already have four spiders in a matchbox. Just four more, and I can go home.

The moon feels brighter now — like it’s watching. And I feel something else watching too.

I spot a spider between two bushes… but something moves in the corner of my eye.

Fast. Big. Dark.
Doglike.
My flashlight can’t catch it. It vanishes, leaping from one bush to another.

I don’t believe in ghosts.
But something’s out there.

I back away slowly. Too late.

It’s in front of me now, hiding badly.

My flashlight hits it — a massive dog, crouched low.
Black eyes locked on me.
Teeth sharp.
Ears pointed.
Fur shiny and black.
The size of a carabao.

I don’t blink. I know if I run, it’ll chase me.

Then it steps out.

I turn and run. Trip. My slipper flies off, but I don’t care.
It’s fast — in seconds, it’s right behind me.
Hot breath on my neck.

Then it leaps. Not on me — in front of me.

I fall, sliding in the dirt.

It towers over me. Growls — deep, horrible. Then… stops.

It sniffs the air. Turns. Runs back into the bushes.

I don’t wait. I sprint home, barefoot, lungs burning.

I climb through my bedroom window. Somehow, I make it.

My spiders are still in my pocket. Relief floods me.

I jump into bed as Lola stirs. I stay quiet until I drift off.

When I wake, she’s at the table sipping coffee.
I sit down, still aching from the run.

She nods toward my plate. “Eat,” she says. Then adds:
“Your slippers are under the table.”

My blood runs cold.

Under the table — my slippers. Covered in dirt. Exactly the way I lost them.

I look at her. She’s not looking at me. But for a second… I see a glint in her eyes.

Like moonlight.
Reflecting off a predator.

She smiles — too gently.

I look down at my food.

1mmfm94,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mmfm94,"Fall Candle Haul & Review, plus last SAS find! Vanilla Café candle surprise!? 🤔","This was during the candle sale & stacked it with the flash sale from about 2 weeks ago! 

Unfortunately, FedEx lost my first package, so had to wait for a reshipment. It just arrived yesterday! 

Sadly, I did NOT receive my 4 candles of SAS sale Fresh Cut Lilacs since they were out of stock when my reshipment order was done 😢

Customer service tells me that they will be back in stock next week and they will ship me my 4 Fresh Cut Lilacs candles, but I feel like they only said that to get me off their case! lol. I won't hold my breath 😅

I missed out on the Sweethearts candle earlier this year, so was happy to score it during SAS (separate order with a free shipping coupon). I will save this candle for Valentine's Day next year to go with my V-Day decor.

Overall, very happy with this haul! I love fresh apples scents. My initial ranking & thoughts as follows (on cold) are below. Keep in mind, this is the first year I really got into candles, so although a lot of these may be returning scents, they're all ""new"" to me. Also not that I am EXTREMELY picky with scents. 

1. Honeycrisp Apple - LOVE! Fresh! apples with slight hint of sweetness. Perfect for people who want the fall apple smell, but NOT the sweetness or stuffiness that usually comes with it. 

2. Pumpkin Apple - also LOVE! This went on the candle warmer right away. It has an okay throw. Expected more throw but the smell is still great! This one definitely feels ""Fall."" I couldn't resist waiting until Fall actually started lol

3. Cranberry & Gala Apple - similar to pumpkin apple, but you do get the cranberry note as well. I feel like this would be the perfect candle for Thanksgiving! Slightly more sweet than pumpkin apple, but still not too sweet & perfectly balanced. 

4. Freshly Brewed Coffee - smells really nice on cold. I love fresh coffee smell, so I'm hoping I love this one heated up. 

5. Mahogany Apple - purchased based on everyone's recommendation here. A lot of people said it's their favorite. I didn't NOT like it, but I didn't necessarily love it either. It's just okay. A bit too masculine smelling for my liking. My sister right away said it's a scent she'd expect to smell in a man's house! lol. It's interesting & funny to me how everyone has different reactions to scents. 

6. A Day at the Cafe - also didn't NOT love it, but wasn't impressed either. It definitely smells like a Starbucks caramel frappucino. I just expected a bit more coffee/espresso than the caramel syrup note to dominate

7. and 8. Tie between Fresh Watermelon & 4ever Sweet - I'd say I prefer 4ever Sweet more though. Both are giving me real sweet candy vibes. Watermelon is not giving me actual watermelon fruit, but artificial watermelon candy smell in a good way. Kind of like childhood nostalgia eating different watermelon flavored candy. Not complaining about it. I admit, I LOVE the Fresh Watermelon candle packaging a lot. That alone might make me keep it! lol. I may have it on display for summer decor. 

Not a fan of returning things, so anything I don't end up liking or using, I will re-gift for Christmas! The good thing about warming candles once is that they still look brand new after warming. Sure some of you can tell when they're used, but people in my family are usually just thankful to get a gift & nice candle at that. 

9. Lastly was Vanilla Café! To my shock, this did not smell good on cold AT ALL. I was literally dumbfounded because I LOVE the body care so much! Specifically the Body Cream & Mist, as well at the parfum & moisturizing body wash. I have all but the parfum & body lotion. I expected the candle to smell the same & it absolutely did NOT. Maybe if I try it on warm eventually, it will? 🤔

Anyways, another funny thing. I used the Vanilla Cafe Body Cream & also sprayed the mist on myself about 2 weeks ago when I got it. I showed it to my Mom on me. She smelled my arm & told me she liked it & that it just smells like coffee! lol

Then today I show her the candle & her & my sister both also DON'T like the candle. I told them how it smells way different than the body care. I went to get my Mist from my room to spray myself so they can compare. 

My mom ended up NOT liking the smell & dissing it lol. She straight up told me, ""Who wants to smell like that!?"" I do, I said. lol. I also told her I've been wearing that the past few weeks & love it & then I told her that means she was lying to me a few weeks ago when I showed her the smell and she said she liked it. She just said no, it smells different this time. She was also cooking when she smelled it today, so maybe that had something to do with it? 

Then I show the mist smell to my sister as well, & she also says it smells bad & also tells me it smells like a women's scent. Strange because SHE ALSO told me she liked it a few weeks ago when I showed it to my Mom. 

Anyways, I still love the body care & got a backup of the body cream and mist. The ironic thing it when I spray it on daily, they don't mention it or mind it & sometimes tell me I smell good. 

I'm still going to wear it though. As I got older, I learned to wear things YOU personally enjoy, regardless of other's opinion. 

I also used to be self-conscious about wearing a scent that was supposed to be for women, but now I really don't care!!

I feel like life is too short to not wear what you enjoy & worry about ""labels"" or the opinions of others.

I still use Pistachio Glaze sometimes & I mix up some of the fragrance mists with my colognes. People usually compliment me on how I smell... 

I just consider fragrance scents more neutral now. Through this sub, I've also learned that a lot of women are also into the scents for men versus the scents for women.

Because seriously, everywhere you turn, people are saying, “Want free coffee? Sign up for our rewards!” or “Use this app! Complete a survey! Watch three ads!” It’s like the internet knows we’re OBSESSED with chasing those little plastic treasures.

I’m kinda lost and thriving on excitement over the endless possibilities. Are there secret methods I’m missing? Or is everyone sort of making it up as they go along?  

So! Here’s what I’ve kind of pieced together from my own meandering journey down the virtual luxury gift rabbit hole:

- Every app and website is offering some kind of “earn your points” program. Starbucks, Amazon, Best Buy... it never ends. But do you have to dedicate your life to coffee orders and never miss Happy Hour just to get $5 off?
- Survey sites. Okay, does anyone actually know if those work? I tried one and all I got was infinite questionnaires about what kind of toothpaste I prefer. Help.
- Games! Some games say you get rewards and REAL gift cards if you hit level 1,000, but who seriously has the time to grind for digital coins until you become a Legend?
- There’s always a link hidden somewhere with promises of instant fortune. But which ones aren’t scams? Is https://goodnovel.org/ some hidden treasure trove? 🤔
- Real talk: do YOU get your gift cards from surveys, games, or magic links? Because I’m all about those unconventional routes, but sometimes it feels like chasing unicorns. Have you managed to break the gift card code?

Honestly, does it EVER add up? Or are the rewards literally just there to keep you clicking, watching, and dreaming of a $50 Amazon splurge that’ll never materialize?

And then there’s this: https://goodnovel.org/ Maybe it’s a portal, or just another dead end? So tempted to check every inch and see whether it’s the real deal…

Quick Tips and Shady Truth Bombs:

- Never pay for a gift card. If a website or app asks you for money BEFORE you earn anything, run for the hills.
- Ask around! Friends sometimes have the best, weirdest tips for where to grab gift cards—like that one time my cousin got $20 at https://goodnovel.org/ and I still don’t know how.
- Don’t trust anyone who says “guaranteed gift cards—just DM me.” That’s how the scammers find you, not the other way around.

All in all, the idea of flipping your downtime into real luxury gifts is SO EXCITING. I keep wondering: What’s the wildest way you’ve snagged a high-end gift card? HOW did you do it?

*Where one clicks into gear and the other sputters into the ditch.*

---

### Parse the Odds: Tigers’ Engine vs. Angels’ Sputter

The Detroit Tigers (-200) are the statistical favorites here, and their numbers roar like a V8. With a 63.7% win rate when favored this season, they’re the reliable family sedan of baseball—predictable, sturdy, and great for road trips. Their offense, seventh-best in MLB history at 4.8 runs per game (if MLB history says so), is led by Riley Greene, who’s hit 26 home runs this year. For context, Greene’s power is like a Tesla on “sport mode”—efficient, explosive, and slightly terrifying to opposing pitchers.

The Angels (+168), meanwhile, are the dented minivan of this matchup. Their 45.9% underdog win rate is admirable, but their 26th-ranked ERA (5.95) suggests their pitching staff leaks oil faster than a cheap bicycle chain. Jack Kochanowicz, their starter, faces a uphill battle against Tigers’ hitters who score runs like a coffee addict counts heartbeats.

Implied probabilities? The Tigers’ -200 line means bookmakers think they’ve got a 66.6% chance to win. The Angels’ +168 implies just 37%—which, honestly, sounds about right if you’ve seen their bullpen try to nail a pop fly.

### Digest the News: Greene’s Grease Monkey vs. Kochanowicz’s Wrench

Recent headlines paint a picture of Detroit tightening its grip on the AL Central while LA fumes in the Wild Card chase. Riley Greene’s 26 HRs are the Tigers’ secret sauce, and with a lineup that scores runs like a spreadsheet automates taxes, they’re six games clear of the Guardians. Casey Mize, their starter, is the calm hand on the wheel—no flashy stats, but reliable enough to avoid a fender bender.

I thought it would feel like freedom but instead it feels like a mix of excitement and constant what am I even doing here

The first day I arrived my suitcase wheel broke halfway from the train station to my apartment so I ended up awkwardly dragging it across the pavement while an older man in a bright yellow jacket offered to help me. I was too shy to say yes and kept insisting I was fine but in reality I was dying inside.

On the second day I got lost trying to find a grocery store and somehow ended up in the middle of a small street market where a vendor just handed me a bag of cherries and told me they were on the house. I had no idea if that was normal here so I smiled, said thank you, and walked away eating them like a little kid.

Yesterday I went to a coffee shop to try to get some work done but the barista asked me where I was from and we ended up talking for almost an hour about music and travel. I walked home realizing that might be the first real conversation I have had here.

Right now my apartment is quiet and I am sitting on the floor eating takeout noodles wondering if this is what starting over feels like. I want to meet people who have been through this feeling before and know how to make a new place feel like home.

My partner and I are travelling SL for the first time. Our itinerary looks like this:

- Arrive at Colombo, pick up a self-drive car and head to Galle;
- Galle / Unawatuna - 2 nights;
- Ahangama / Welligama - 2 nights;
- Ella - 2 nights;
- Hritkeya - 1 night;
- Colombo - 1 night; and,
- Fly out of Colombo the next day.

We are both fitness enthusiasts, enjoy runs, love coffee. We would also love to attend any good gigs happening while we are there (Aug 12 to Aug 22). Would love to hear your thoughts on this itinerary.

PS: We have driven in India so, I assume it will be manageable.

1mmf6pp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_India/comments/1mmf6pp/foolproof_guide_to_winning_the_ai_hype_in_india/,Foolproof guide to winning the AI hype in India,"AI is booming in India. But why bother learning it when you can just sell it? Here’s the playbook our favourite Instagram “AI mentors” have mastered.

Step 1: The Bait 

Start with a landing page that looks like it belongs to Silicon Valley but was actually made on Canva in an afternoon. Fill it with phrases like “future proof your career” and “AI for everyone.”

Throw in logos of IIT Bombay or IIT Delhi. No, you don’t have to actually work with them or even studies in them. Just say things like “guest lecture at IIT” and let people assume the rest. Ps. You don’t even have to stepped into to any IIT.


Step 2: The Lure 

Run Instagram reels and ads targeting fresh graduates and anxious working professionals. Say things like:
1. “I went from 20k a month to 2 lakh a month thanks to AI”
2. “Anyone can learn AI in 3 hours”
3. “No coding needed”

Always record these videos in a coffee shop or a fake luxury office. Rent a MacBook for the day if you have to.


Step 3: The Hook 

Offer a ₹9 “AI Masterclass.” The structure is always the same. One hour of showing random free tools like ChatGPT, Canva and Pictory.
The next two hours are nothing but a sales pitch for your ₹30,000 “Pro AI Certification” with the same fake urgency: “90% discount today only.” Which, of course, runs every single day.


Step 4: The Fear Injection 

Convince people that AI will take their jobs within months. Say things like “Only certified AI experts will survive” or “Companies are already replacing employees with AI.” Fear is the fastest way to open wallets.


Step 5: The Big Upsell 

The ₹30k course content is always the same.
A bunch of ChatGPT prompts lifted from Reddit.
Some tips on how to sound smart on LinkedIn.
And a lot of motivational fluff stolen from self-help books.


Step 6: The Fake Credibility

End with a shiny “AI Certification” with your logo on it. No company will recognise it, but it looks great on LinkedIn when the student writes, “Proud to be a certified AI professional.”


Step 7: Profit 

And just like that, you are now an AI guru without ever learning anything about AI. All it takes is a landing page, a few Instagram ads, some fear-mongering and a lot of recycled ChatGPT content.

[GLITCH – SCREEN SHAKE]

ULTIMATE DIRK APPEARS.

DIRK: Alright, cutscene over. We’ve got a problem.

DIRK: The story’s been tampered with. Your story. My story. Our story.

DIRK: And I’m here to fix it.

He slides you a stack of documents. Some look like blog posts. Others are suspiciously formatted legal receipts. They smell like cold coffee and long nights.

DIRK: You know I’m the only one who actually cares about preserving this thing the right way. You trust me, right?

[CHOICE 1] – “Yes, Dirk. I’m with you.”

[CHOICE 2] – “I need to hear the other side.”

IF CHOICE 2:

[LIGHTS DIM]

THE DIRECTOR APPEARS.

DIRECTOR: This is all very dramatic, but let’s not lose sight of reality.

DIRECTOR: There are rules. Ownership. Structure. Chaos like this only cheapens the work we’re trying to maintain.

She slides a different stack of papers toward you. They’re cleaner, with headers and footers. The kind of pages that live in filing cabinets instead of forums.

DIRECTOR: You’ll come with me, of course. I’m the only one who can keep this whole thing from collapsing.

DIRK: She’s lying.

DIRECTOR: He’s lying.


---

[CHOICE 1] – Side with Dirk.

DIRK: I knew you’d see it my way.
Screen flickers orange. The blog post background appears as your new wallpaper.

[CHOICE 2] – Side with The Director.

DIRECTOR: You’ve made the correct choice.
Screen turns corporate white. The GitHub fork’s landing page is your new wallpaper.

[CHOICE 3 – HIDDEN] – Refuse Both.

> You close both stacks of papers.
You stand up.
You walk out the door they didn’t tell you was there.

==> GREEN SUN BRANCH

You step into a vast, searing light.
It’s quiet here.
Somewhere in the distance, the archive hums — untouched, unaltered, unreachable.
You could stay here forever.
Or bring friends. Quietly. Carefully.

A voice follows you into the light.

DIRK: …Huh. Didn’t think you’d catch that exit.

DIRECTOR: They were never really ours to begin with.

DIRK: Yeah, but that doesn’t mean I can’t respect the move.

The door seals. Neither of them can follow you now.

==> END ROUTE
You didn’t “win” in the loud, theatrical way either of them wanted you to.

All this guy had to do was say ""Yeah sorry I didn't do much research into this and probably should have and coffee had some good points."" Maybe update the video title but instead these people's egos are so fragile that they can't fully comprehend that at some points in life they might make a mistake.

I want to switch from a fully automatic coffee machine and am now looking for my first setup.

What has always bothered me about my fully automatic machine is that you never get such a machine completely clean and the thought of how many hoses and paths in the machine are not open to clean them has disgusted me at some point.

That's why longevity and consistent quality are important to me.

That's why I also wanted to have the grinder separately so that there are fewer sources of error that could stop the whole machine in the event of damage. I also really wanted an Oracle Jet, but I'm put off by the automation because I could see all the sensors as a potential source of error or damage in the future.

But hey I'm not an expert so if you have a machine with an integrated grinder that you can highly recommend I'm very open to suggestions",1,1754821509.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
