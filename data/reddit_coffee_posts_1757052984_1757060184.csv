- PCOS. No recent labs to share, hgb a1c 5.7% a few months ago. I was on metformin 2000mg extended release daily for 3 months earlier this year but discontinued it because the GI symptoms were awful and I moved internationally and medical access has been trickier (Quebec, Canada)
- Hx of preeclampsia that developed into chronic HTN from 2022-2024. Was on labetalol 200mg daily but was able to discontinue this 4 months ago since BPs have been steadily at 120/80. 
- Daily Mvi, 5mg melatonin started this week, started on Yaz 3 weeks ago.
- weight lift 3x per week and hit 13-15K steps daily.

About the same time I started Yaz, I have been waking about nightly around 3-4am. Sometimes I can fall back asleep, sometimes I can't fall back asleep for an hour. Sometimes I have to pee but not always. No issues with peeing or pain peeing during the day.

I go to sleep routinely at 930-10pm, avoid drinking water/eating after 8pm. No caffeine other than my 7am coffee. No daytime naps. No screen time at bedtime. Never had this issue before. 
Increased stress as I'm starting internships to get my credentials in Quebec as I was trained as an RD in the USA but overall not debilitating. 
I've taken 1/2 capsule OTC unisom previously for sleep PRN during periods of increased stress but I haven't had to take that since prior to the move in April. When I've taken it in the last 3 weeks, I still woke up. 

Limited access to a PCP here. Yaz was started by pharmacist. I was on it 20 years ago without issue that I recall. I had a copper IUD after my pregnancy but I removed it prior to international move due to medical access concerns.

Thinking it's time to discontinue Yaz and try something else.

Right now, I drink black coffee in the morning.

* Has a decent amount of caffeine
* As few carbs as possible
* Is not acidic enough to wear down tooth enamel
* Some staining is okay, but it shouldn't stain too badly

What I've considered so far:

* Green tea -> Too little caffeine. I could drink a lot of it but then the trace carbs add up.

* Yerba mate (loose leaf) -> Seems perfect, but I find conflicting information about its net carb content. I use 9g with 500ml of water, then drink through a bombilla. Any idea how many carbs dissolve in the water?
* Guayusa -> Seems like a good candidate, does anyone have experience with that?

1n8z5bi,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1n8z5bi/success_is_near/,Success is near,"A few months back I made a long post about my experience with this condition and my plan for recovery.

All is going well, had my gastroscopy today after 2 years without. Signs of reflux as expected, but overall unremarkable gastroscopy. Biopsy results in a couple weeks.

I expect to see h pylori come back as a possible cause. By ruling out other bacteria‚Äôs, my (unrelated) kinesiologist said that‚Äôs likely an infection contributing to my condition, and kinesiologists have built a sense of trust with me. After having 2 points of chronic pain for over a year as well as chronic reflux, kinesiology/chiropractic treatment has given me relief in my pain, as well as assisted my reflux treatment. 

In 1 month with a kinesiologist/chiropractor, my reflux has improved more than 1.5 years with 3 GP‚Äôs, ENT, Gastroenterologist, and pharmaceutical treatment. The only pharmaceutical suggested treatment that helps my case noticeably is Gaviscon dual action.

I‚Äôm taking terra health essential capsules (acid relief) and I‚Äôm completely off pantoprazole for 3 weeks now. I needed a natural alternative and I get more relief from terra health than I was with the PPI. I recommend giving them a shot if you‚Äôre struggling to find helpful medication. Steer clear from the capsules that include hcl, these have more potential for risking making things work (though they can work for a handful of people, and I‚Äôm basing that knowledge of people I know that got results)

I‚Äôm turning to natural remedies because of unsuccessful pharmaceutical treatment. I recommend doing your own research and giving them a shot, whatever natural remedy you choose. You won‚Äôt know whether or not they help until you try.

I‚Äôve been eating with a strict paleo diet for 2 months, with 1 probiotic and 2 terra health capsules with food everyday, as well as 70mcg selenium daily. It‚Äôs inexplainable the amount of improvements I‚Äôve been getting from living this way. Even without knowing the cause, I‚Äôve pretty much cured my reflux.

I will keep working to find the cause and eliminate it. I will have an in depth conversation with my kinesiologist about alternative treatments with h pylori, and whatever other results are uncovered by the biopsy results. I know there‚Äôs 1 known way to treat it (antibiotics), but I also have a strong viewpoint that alternative medicine and remedies are only looked down upon because the medical industry is skewed to treat things one way and one way only. 

My reflux improved more through alternative treatments than pharmaceutical drugs. Don‚Äôt take my advice in not listening to dr‚Äôs as that‚Äôs a personal grudge in which I won‚Äôt see one unless I really have to, but without a doubt take my advice on thinking for yourself and doing your own research, trial and error, etc.

For the last week before gastroscopy, I ate unhealthy as a test to how my condition is currently. Completely unrestricted. Coffee, zyn (nicotine) pouches, chocolate, sugar, heaps of it. Fried food, spicy food, curries, and overeating, eating late etc. While my reflux symptoms are still present, I am without a doubt on a path of 100% recovery, as over this week, my symptoms have been barely noticeable. 100% recovery is possible, and I will get there. 

Knowing the cause is something which will make it easier, but I‚Äôve gotten this far all while not being 100% sure of or treating the cause. If I can do that with 2 months of discipline in diet and lifestyle as well as medication which WORKS FOR ME (this is important, everyone‚Äôs different), then at the very least, YOU CAN TRY.

My diet will consist of paleo specific foods for the rest of the year, coffee, as well as my capsules. In the next month or 2, I will know the potential causes, and treat all of them. As of next year, reflux present or not, I‚Äôm going the year without coffee (or any drugs for that matter).

I have diaphragm tightening issues, most likely caused by adrenal dysfunction, (diagnosed and will be treated by my kinesiologist) parasites (currently being treated), and bacteria (treated as soon as I find out specifics and a bit more information). Treatment with all will help improve my digestive system.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU WONT KNOW WHO TO SEE OR HOW TO TREAT YOUR CONDITION UNLESS YOU TRY THINGS OUT. I‚Äôve seen 8 physical therapists, 4 GP‚Äôs, heart and lung specialists, an ENT and a Gastroenterologist. Only after seeing everyone, taking their advice, doing my own research, and trying diets, medications, remedies and other lifestyle changes, have I finally found my path to recovery.

Do not lose hope. I lost hope for a year and my condition worsened. But having hope is not enough either. Have enough hope that you‚Äôll get better, and have enough determination to find the solutions to your problems that you won‚Äôt take no for an answer. Look outside the box if you must. I mean a fkn kinesiologist has helped me with reflux more than any specialist I‚Äôve seen. You never know until you find out.

I expect to make another update early next year stating that I‚Äôve found the cause, treated it, and got my life back with a 100% recovery. Is this not a dream we all have? I hope this inspires some of you that have almost lost hope to not give up. 

2 months ago I predicted that after almost 2 years of unexplained reflux, I will get better. I stuck with my plan, and now the light at the end of the tunnel is literally beaming as my success story is within a few short months.

I‚Äôm making one more prediction that my 100% recovery success story will be written and posted by January. I was right before, and I‚Äôm going to be right again. Adopt this mindset, and have discipline. A disciplined attempt is the only acceptable attempt to fix your health issues. Your health problems are up to you to solve, not your dr‚Äôs (who btw probably care about your condition less than you think). Your health is also your wealth, and if I can fix mine, you can too.

Ask me anything, send me a message, whatever you want. I‚Äôm here to help and inspire. Thanks for reading.

* Repainting and sealing an old coffee table
* Learning how to safely use basic tools like drills, sanders, and a jigsaw

*By Your Humble Sportswriter and Handicapper, Who Still Thinks ""K"" is a Legitimate Cereal*

The Los Angeles Angels (-148) stride into this matchup like a .228 team batting average trying to convince you it‚Äôs *champ*. The Oakland Athletics (+125), meanwhile, are the definition of ‚Äúunderdog with a 4.82 ERA‚Äù‚Äîwhich is to say, they‚Äôre bad at pitching but decent at hoping. Let‚Äôs break this down with the mathematical precision of a man who once calculated the odds of his own coffee spilling (spoiler: it‚Äôs 100%).

---

### Key Stats & Implied Probabilities

* **Angels Implied Win Probability**: 59.2% (from -148 odds). Real-world win rate when favored? 51.5%. Translation: The line loves them; the season doesn‚Äôt.
* **Athletics Implied Win Probability**: 44.9% (their actual underdog win rate). They‚Äôll need a miracle‚Äîor a Kyle Hendricks clone with a 1.4 HR/9 ERA to bail them out.
* **Offense-Oxymoron Alert**: The Angels lead MLB in strikeouts (9.8/9 innings) but rank 4th in HRs. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll swing for the fences‚Ä¶ and miss.‚Äù The A‚Äôs counter with 638 runs (4.5 R/G) but a bullpen that probably still thinks it‚Äôs 2020.

We have never gone out 1-1, we always meet with other people of said classes for coffee etc. But I've noticed he's making some jokes that come off as flirty: for example, he'll ask me again and again to get on his motorbike for a quick drive (but never really asks other girls there) or ask me to go on a date (context: i shared with the group that I haven't had a first date ever, and two of the guys there \[including him\] told me that they were going to take me out so I can experience that, and we made jokes about who would choose the better spot etc. It was a joke made once when we had first met, the other guy has dropped it but *he* has brought it back in conversation a few times in a more serious way, actually asking me when and where).

Now, I want to tell him that his jokes may be too much sometimes, as I end up feeling awkward and don't know how to exactly respond, because I don't want to seem stuck up/can't take a joke, but at the same time don't want to lead him on if he's indeed flirting with me. I was thinking maybe addressing the jokes and not the flirty undertones, because I'm not 100% sure and a lot of times guys end up being like ""oh, it's just a joke, i don't even like you what are you talking about?"" and I don't want to deal with that right now.

1n8yzdd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n8yzdd,Realtiy Check: 1994-1997 Dodge B3500 vans and B3500-based Class-B RVs with 4000 lb rated front axles (very long post),"First off, I have a 1997 Dodge B3500 Roadtrek 190 Popular. These are excellent, real, honest-to-Betsy North American-built vans that are basically tanks. I wouldn‚Äôt trade mine for new a Sprinter, Transit or Promaster even if you paid me. But, then again, my ‚Äúmobile device‚Äù (Oh how I loathe that term) is a TCL Flip 3 phone... so what do I know?

Here‚Äôs the upshot: if you own a 1994-1997 Dodge B3500 van that has the 4000 lb. rated front axle, then you need to start looking for crucial front-end replacement parts NOW. Not when they break, but three weeks ago from yesterday.

Even though Dodge made probably hundreds of thousands of B-series vans from ‚Äô94 to ‚Äô97, they didn‚Äôt make so many of YOUR van, the one with the awesome, mighty, optional 4000 lb rated front axle. Also known as the ‚Äú\[DJE\]‚Äù version in the Mopar parts catalogue. And that is an enormous problem.

You see, the vast majority of B3500 vans from 1994-1997 were built with ‚Äú3600 lb‚Äù rated front axles. These are the ‚Äú\[DJD\]‚Äù front axles (Mopar parts catalogue) used on most B3500 van. The 3600 lb versions are so ‚Äústandard‚Äù, and so common that even some of the full-on, tricked-out, lardo rollin‚Äô oak armoires on wheels conversion vans (like some Pleasure-Way and Leisure Travel models) still ran on these 3600 lb front axle components. And for people with these vans, the ‚Äúweak sauce‚Äù plain-Jane ‚Äú\[DJD\]‚Äù front end versions, well congrats! you actually have a good chance of staying on the road over the long-term. For now.

But for those of us with B3500 vans (and the Roadtreks and others built on them) with the mighty 4000 lb rated front axle ‚Äú\[DJE\]‚Äù... well, we are totally screwed. Why? Because THERE ARE NO FRONT BRAKE ROTORS AVAILABLE or other critical wear replacement parts available. Period. Not hyperbole. No bullshitting. No ‚Äúdoom & gloom‚Äù rumor mongering. Just a fact.

Here‚Äôs what you need to know. Our vans don‚Äôt just simply have front brake rotors... oh no, we‚Äôre special... our vans have a one-piece rotor / hub assembly that is made of unicorn gall stones and petrified sasquatch droppings. That‚Äôs right! And if you need a front brake rotor (and they do, you know, like, wear out over time and need to replaced just like any other brake wear component) you‚Äôll suddenly own a big, 8500 lb lawn ornament instead of a cool ‚Äúretro‚Äù van for doing your carefree vanlife-ing and pour-over coffee video-ing in. That is, until a unicorn spleen shows up on Ebay, or you get lucky at a junkyard and are twice-blessed the used rotors are... useable.

Even if you do manage to find the rotor/hub assembly (and there are couple of ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù options possible), pray you don‚Äôt need a ‚Äú\[DJE\]‚Äù thrust washer, a ‚Äú\[DJE\]‚Äù adjusting nut, or a ‚Äú\[DJE\]‚Äù wheel hub grease cap for your front wheel bearing stack. You‚Äôll have to have someone machine those or modify a similar kind.

Needless to say, I just wanted to share this with you, as I just went through a full 2-month ordeal that ended only 8 hours ago. I needed a pair of front rotors at the end of June, and so my van sat at the mechanic‚Äôs shop from July 1st until this afternoon. I hit the lottery of Mopar parts, found a pair of rotor/hub assemblies on Ebay that weren‚Äôt exactly what I needed, but were 99% what I needed (only difference is the wheel/lug stud diameter being 5/8‚Äô-18 instead of 1/2‚Äù-20). That means my front lug nuts are a different size than my rears, and so the torque settings on them have to be SCREAMED at any grease-monkeys that touch my Roadtrek from here on out.

A shiny pair of NOS Mopar # 3637626 rotors are now on my Roadtrek. The ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù rotor/hubs should have been # 52007716, but #3637626 versions are essentially the same thing, except the wheel stud diameter. these The important thing is that it is back on the road and, I think, all should be hunky-dory for now. Knock on wood.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Brewers vs. Pirates: A One-Sided Slapstick Special**  
The Milwaukee Brewers (-156) are here to humiliate the Pittsburgh Pirates in a game that‚Äôll make you question why the Pirates even brought a bat. Let‚Äôs break it down with math, mayhem, and a sprinkle of prop bets:

### The Numbers That Make You Snort Coffee

* **Brewers‚Äô Moneyline Implied Probability**: 61.1% (thanks to their 74.1% win rate when -156 or shorter). The Pirates? A laughable 38.9% chance to avoid total embarrassment.
* **Offense**: The Brewers mash 5.1 runs/game (vs. Pirates‚Äô 3.7). William Contreras (.411 SLG) and Brice Turang (.291 BA) will likely turn the Pirates‚Äô defense into a pi√±ata.
* **Pitching**: Quinn Priester (3.28 ERA, 107 K in 134 IP) vs. Johan Oviedo (2-0 in 4 starts, but hey, he‚Äôs *technically* a rookie). Priester‚Äôs got more K‚Äôs than the Pirates‚Äô entire team HR total (102).

### Prop Bets to Wager Your Grandma‚Äôs Soul On

1. **Brice Turang Over 0.5 Doubs** (-105 at FanDuel): Turang‚Äôs a doubles machine (.300 OBP). Bet him to turn singles into ‚ÄúWait, did that count?‚Äù moments.
2. \**William Contreras Over 2.5 Total Bases*

Scene 1: The Arrival**

At the docks of Manila, a well-dressed American named **Charles Whitmore** steps off a merchant vessel. To most, he is a ‚Äúbusinessman‚Äù importing machinery. In truth, he is the first official **U.S. intelligence officer** assigned to Luzviminda.

In his leather satchel:

* forged Luzvimindan papers,
* lists of potential collaborators,
* and orders from Washington:
  *‚ÄúDestabilize quietly. Observe always. The Republic must not grow unchecked.‚Äù*

---

### **Scene 2: Seeds of Intrigue**

Whitmore rents a house near Ermita, presenting himself as a friendly trader. He buys drinks for Luzvimindan officers, listens to gossip in taverns, and slips silver coins to desperate dockworkers.

Soon, whispers reach him: a discontented **Luzvimindan officer**, embittered for being passed over for promotion. Whitmore invites him for coffee.

> **Whitmore:**
> ‚ÄúMen like you deserve better. The Republic talks of equality, yet keeps you waiting. Perhaps‚Ä¶ you and I can help each other.‚Äù

A seed of betrayal is planted.

---

### **Scene 3: Gregoria‚Äôs Suspicion**

In Malaca√±ang, **Gregoria de Jes√∫s** receives a report from her intelligence chief.

> **Chief:**
> ‚ÄúMadam President, there is a new American merchant‚Ä¶ too curious for his trade. He asks about our navy, our ports, our elections.‚Äù

Gregoria frowns, staring at the report by candlelight.

> **Gregoria:**
> ‚ÄúSpain lost us with force. America will try with whispers.‚Äù

She orders the creation of a **counter-intelligence bureau**‚Äîthe first in Luzvimindan history. A cat-and-mouse game begins.

---

### **Scene 4: The Spark in the Dark**

One night in Intramuros, Whitmore secretly meets his contact, the embittered officer. Documents exchange hands‚Äîlists of supply routes, weaknesses in coastal defenses.

But unseen, a **young journalist-soldier** follows them, sketchbook in hand, recording every detail. The Republic is not blind.

---

### **Closing Scene: Manila at Midnight**

From his balcony, Whitmore gazes at the lantern-lit streets of Manila. He smiles coldly.

> **Whitmore (to himself):**
> ‚ÄúBeautiful city‚Ä¶ too beautiful for rebels. Sooner or later, we‚Äôll bring you into order.‚Äù

But in the shadows across the street, Gregoria‚Äôs agents watch him.

Obviously, even with splenda, you need to monitor how much you consume, but if it is a better alternative I'm open to switching.

After a particularly rough couple of days I started looking for a community to try and find any sort of solution to not feeling like absolute crap all day every day.

For a little bit of backstory, January this year I made myself some leftover Turkey noodle soup, ate it a tad later than I should have and woke up the next morning emptying my stomach violently. Chocked it up to bad turkey. Couple weeks later go for a milkshake with a friend (I had figured at this point I was lactose intolerant from previous issues but would occasionally have 'cheat' days) same thing next morning. Then it was two more bouts after pork belly and one more after a milkshake in the following months.

I started feeling nauseous ALL THE TIME and especially when waking. Just always on the verge of feeling like I was going to be sick and completely and utterly miserable. I was travelling a lot for work at this point so there I am in London trying to force anything in me and laying on a hotel room bathroom floor with a push peddle bin in my arms.

I go to the doctor's finally and they test for bacteria (I had taken an Omeprazole over the counter but they said it shouldn't interfere and I still wonder if it did) and do a wide sweep of blood tests. No bacteria, bloods fine and from what they can tell I was like this as a kid too so get given the title of 'Chronic Gastritis' and sent on my way (as a child I remember several bouts of vomiting and a terrible appetite and hatred for processed hotdogs but I've been better now for a decade and a half so it felt very far away).

I'm on acidex MAX (I call it minty milk to cheer myself up) and Esomeprazol 40mg now. I will concede that I am a stress head and three years previously my mother passed in 2022 and I've been a workaholic since. I was chugging Gavascon nightly thinking the worse I could develop would be ulcers and I'd just get those fixed and Cary on with my day, how very stupid that was now looking back.

I'm just so frustrated, every time I try and reintroduce something I love (coffee, gochujang, etc.) it just backfires on me horribly. I had a takeaway on the 16th with a little order of sticky toffee pudding and that came straight back the next morning after laying on the sofa all night miserable. I'm at my whits end, there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the days I'm sick vs the one's I'm not sick. I don't really get stomach pain so much as a constant cloying in the back of my throat like I'm going to be sick all the time now. I hate it and I'm at the point of just eating plain rice and flavourless broth forever because I can't live this nauseous all the time.

What breaks my heart the most is I love cooking, l. Truly one of my coping mechanisms with stress was to just whip up a beautiful and delicious meal from scratch with wonderful fresh/unique ingredients and now the wind is very much out of those sails. Before she passed I watched my mum struggle terribly with diverticulitis and I just don't want to live like that just like I didn't want her to have to.

Thanks everyone for the space to just rant, it's helped and it's just nice to know there's a community here for when the days and weeks are bad üíú",1,1757057509.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False
1n8ytfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1n8ytfi/i_just_hit_80_fi_my_learnings/,I Just Hit 80% FI - My Learnings,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm really happy to share a big personal milestone today. I‚Äôve officially reached 80 percent of my financial independence goal *(= 80% of annual life expenses / dividend income)*. What makes it even better is that it‚Äôs based entirely on projected annual dividend income from my investments üéâ

I wanted to post this for anyone out there, especially fellow Europeans, who might be wondering if this is actually possible. The short answer is yes, **it absolutely is**.

Financial independence used to feel like something vague and far away. But once I broke it down into smaller steps and focused on the parts I could control, it slowly started becoming real. You don‚Äôt need a six-figure salary (but it does help of course üòâ) or access to some secret investing loophole. What you do need, in my opinion, is a solid foundation, patience, and a willingness to learn.

Here are a few lessons that helped me get this far. Maybe they‚Äôll help you too:

**1. Take ownership and get curious**  
The most important step was deciding to take responsibility for my own financial future. I didn‚Äôt outsource it or chase the latest stock tips. I spent time learning how dividend growth investing works and why it suits me. Books, podcasts, forums, YouTube, all of it. Over time, I built enough confidence to make decisions and stick with them, even when the market got under stress.

**2. Discipline is everything**  
This process takes time. A lot of time. But consistency makes it work. I treated my monthly investments like a fixed expense by **paying myself first**, and not something I‚Äôd only do when I had some money left. That kind of discipline turns small efforts into something powerful over the long run.

**3. Celebrate every win**  
Don‚Äôt wait for the big moment to feel proud. I still remember the first dividend that showed up in my account. It was tiny, but it felt amazing. Then it grew to cover a coffee, then lunch, and now it‚Äôs covering a meaningful chunk of my monthly costs. Those small milestones made the whole journey more motivating and real.

**4. Be patient**  
Compounding works, but not overnight. There were plenty of slow months. Times when nothing seemed to move. But that‚Äôs normal. If you trust your process and keep going, progress adds up. You just have to give it time.

**5. Don‚Äôt over-tinker**  
This one‚Äôs huge. Once you‚Äôve picked a strategy that fits you, stick to it. I see a lot of people jumping from one idea to the next, hoping to speed things up. But I think that it usually does more harm than good. The way I think about it is simple: the more you mess with it, the less it works. Focus on the long game.

Hitting 80 percent feels amazing, but it‚Äôs not the end. It‚Äôs just a new phase. Every dividend that comes in now feels like a small piece of freedom. If I can do this, starting from zero and living in Europe, so can you.

For those just getting started, I hope this gives you a bit of encouragement. And for anyone already on the path, keep going. You‚Äôre building something powerful, even if it doesn‚Äôt always feel like it.

One dividend at a time.

I am left with little over 2,050 a month and I can‚Äôt manage to save. For my rent and utilities it‚Äôs always ¬£650-¬£700 per month maximum. 
My family is always wondering how come i can‚Äôt save ( they just see 2,050- 700= ¬£1,350 available to spend and save). 

I always keep ¬£650 minimum to have for next month‚Äôs rent 

so
To start with I have ¬£1,350

From ¬£1,350- I have ¬£200 going out monthly into a saving account I will use to do an important purchase in december so that will stop in 3 months as I will have saved the required amount.

I have some credit card debt
 1. ¬£836 on Credit card 1 which I used all within june july- 1month as I had an emergency- it was 1,2k but managed to pay some of it off but i still use it sometimes for smaller things ( Limit is 1,5k if relevant)

2. I have ¬£300 on Credit card 2- but this fluctuates monthly as I do all my shopping and travel sometimes and coffee runs on it as well as most direct debits. ( limit is ¬£900 if relevant).
I used to be able to pay it off fully each month before june, but can t seem to be able to do that now. 

In direct Debits I have about ¬£78-80 a month ( gym, sim card, spotify) 

I am paying ¬£50 a month to paypal for a thing for my family which I have managed to halve from ¬£500 to ¬£250 so i ll be done in 5 months.

My weekly grocery shopping goes between ¬£30-¬£50 maximum which I use credit card 2 for as it is the one I got on my apple pay

I can‚Äôt think of any other purchases but there s always a transfer here and there if I go out maybe once a month? again between ¬£30-¬£50 but not regular.

My credit score used to be 966 back in may but since i had that emergency it keeps going down cause I have borrowed more than 30% of the amount i could use on the credit card ( currently at 825 now). Idk how to finally come clean with everything. I tried many times to put it all together and budget but I always come short, maybe someone with a more analytic mind can help?


I don‚Äôt have a huge goal in mind just now, I want to be able to start saving, maybe even for a house in a couple of years. But Idk how to be more financially responsible.

i‚Äôd appreciate any advice.

Life has become a routine over the past year, and that, somehow, always felt like an excuse.

But the more I think about it, the more I realize: **routine** is not boring. In fact, it's beautiful. There is a calm rhythm in our daily lives that we often overlook, as moments slip by unnoticed yet shape our days with a comforting familiarity.

Take a normal morning, for instance. For most of us, it begins with the same sequence: waking up, getting ready, and stepping out to face our daily challenges. And yet, in this repetition lies something oddly heartwarming.

You notice the same people every day, the ones who form the background of your daily life. The morning walkers, the milkman balancing crates, the newspaper guy on his bike. For me, it‚Äôs our apartment watchman. I see him walking toward the main road just as I leave for work. Every day, without fail, we exchange a nod, a smile, and a silent acknowledgment.¬†

Then there‚Äôs the commute, most likely via local train or bus. You rush to catch the same one every day, not just to be on time, but because that‚Äôs *your* train. And around you, there‚Äôs a cast of familiar strangers, faces you've come to recognize, people who share the same urgency, the same timing. Over time, these strangers become silent companions in your daily story as if you're all in this together. And when one of them doesn't show up one day, you notice. You wonder.

At work, too, life flows in patterns. Coffee breaks, lunch breaks, shared glances in meetings, each becoming small rituals you didn‚Äôt know you needed. I take a post-lunch walk every day, and there‚Äôs a man I always pass; same path, opposite direction. We cross at the exact same spot every day, as if it‚Äôs scripted. The day he didn‚Äôt appear, I paused. Strange how these small encounters start to matter without ever saying a word.

Even the evening return has its rhythm. That same watchman again, now heading home, just like me. And if even one piece in this pattern shifts, a delay, an absence, a disruption, it feels... off. Unsettling, almost. Am I the only one who feels this way? Maybe. Maybe not.

Here‚Äôs the point: **there‚Äôs beauty in things being normal**. We don‚Äôt realize how precious stability is until it breaks. Think about the last time you had a fever or a cold. Didn‚Äôt you long for the day when you could just breathe normally, eat comfortably, and go about your day? Those ‚Äúnormal‚Äù days that we often overlook are precious as others.

Yes, breaks are necessary. We take trips, escape the routine, and get new experiences. And those are wonderful too. But maybe, just maybe, there‚Äôs magic in the mundane. The same people. The same spots. The same comfort. A kind of poetry in the repetition. A quiet joy in simply knowing what to expect.

We don‚Äôt have to wait for a big moment to feel alive. Sometimes, **life is beautiful just the way it repeats itself**.

moving on from him was one of the hardest things i‚Äôve been through. he was my multo before the song multo ever existed. he set the standard without even meaning to. we didn‚Äôt end because of bad blood, but because my family found out. i was young and scared, but he was ready to fight for me. he even said once, ‚Äúif i have to face your parents or get punched by your brothers, it‚Äôs fine, as long as we‚Äôre okay.‚Äù

and he did fight for me. he tried again and again to win me back, for years. but i pushed him away out of fear. he made me promise no boyfriends, no suitors, and that he‚Äôd come back for me. even after we broke up, he would follow me from a distance just to make sure i got home safe.

but people get tired. when he finally gave up, he changed. he played around, switched girls like clothes. people said it was because of me. he even told them i was his greatest love, and that i broke him. last year, he got married.

and last night when i saw him, i felt nothing. no ache, no heaviness, no longing. just peace. i walked past him like he was just another face. he saw me too, but we both pretended not to.

and that‚Äôs okay. for the first time in years, i wasn‚Äôt sad. i wasn‚Äôt bitter. i was just genuinely happy for him, and for me too. six years ago, seeing him would‚Äôve broken me. but now, i can say i‚Äôm proud of us for taking different paths, and proud of myself because i finally let go. nakausad na, for real this time.

letting this out here because i don‚Äôt wanna tell it to my friends hehe :))",66,1757057041.0,OffMyChestPH,10,1.0,False

A diary of the visit, published on Friday, showed taxpayers were billed $70,124 including $41,410 for airfares and $25,410 for accommodation during the 10-day visit.

It also showed a further $3,304 in additional expenses for Ms Symes, her chief of staff Ken Macpherson and the Premier‚Äôs chief of staff Damian Karmelich.

The inclusion of Mr Karmelich as part of the travelling party has sparked concern inside government about the threat level that Victoria could be hit with a damaging downgrade.

An analysis of the extensive travel diaries of former Treasurer Tim Pallas shows he was never accompanied by a staffer from the Premier‚Äôs office.

The diary also revealed Ms Symes met with the agencies again in June, shortly after landing back in Melbourne, sparkling further concern about how closely Victoria is being watched.

In her first budget, handed down in May, Ms Symes unveiled projections that net debt would balloon to an estimated $194bn by 2028-29 ‚Äî or $71,000 per Victorian household.

It will carry an attached interest bill of $10.6bn ‚Äî or $28.9m dollars a day.

She also spruiked a return to an operating surplus of $600m despite that figure being down $1bn on earlier forecasts, and said Victoria was on track to begin reducing debt.

Ratings agencies demanded evidence of fiscal discipline in the budget, which was handed down just two weeks before Ms Symes flew to New York.

Ms Symes said meeting with agencies ‚Äúprovided an opportunity to affirm Victoria‚Äôs progress against its fiscal strategy.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe meetings also provided insights into Moody‚Äôs and Standard and Poor‚Äôs US inflation expectations, corporate balance sheets of US companies, and how US financial regulation may impact systemic financial risk. Moody‚Äôs and Standard and Poor‚Äôs also shared their perspectives on the global macroeconomic outlook and trends.‚Äù

She said the US visit focused on strengthening engagement with major credit rating agencies and key global financial investors and stakeholders as well as reinforcing investor confidence.

She also met with the United Nations to discuss opportunities to sell off Treasury Corporation of Victoria bonds.

Ms Symes said she would continue to engage with the credit ratings agencies to reinforce Victoria‚Äôs progress towards its fiscal strategy she said would include future Commonwealth funding contributions and savings from the thousands of expected job cuts inside the Victorian Public Service.

Shadow treasurer, James Newbury, questioned the expense of the trip.

‚ÄúInstead of reigning in spending, the Treasurer has spent $7,000 a day of your money on travelling to New York to meet with companies, she later met in the same month in Melbourne,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúShe could have saved us all the $70,000 and simply met them in Melbourne for the cost of a cup of coffee.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs also staggering is that the Premier sent her senior minder to babysit the Treasurer.

Unfortunately, it‚Äôs starting to not work properly. It blinks whenever you try to brew coffee on either side and you have to press what you want multiple times.

But, it seems impossible to get the same machine again. No one has it. There are other ‚Äúcheap‚Äù ones but I want something reliable. 

It seems like I need to choose one machine over the other. Problem is, I don‚Äôt think the vertuo will be the right choice for me since some types of coffee hurt my stomach.

I‚Äôve played with having both and choosing which one to use (like Keurig in the office, nespresso in the kitchen). Not sure.

1n8yjzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1n8yjzv/new_here/,New here,"Hi everyone, it's my first time on this subreddit. I'm looking to learn more about narcolepsy from people who live with it and make connections with others who spend their days fighting to stay awake and worrying about sleep attacks at inconvenient times.

Full disclosure, I'm not yet diagnosed so I hope it's okay that I'm posting. I've suspected I have narcolepsy for many years but Ive always been dismissed and told I'm ""just a tired mom."" I also have clinical depression so it's most often blamed on that, but fatigue or sleepiness doesn't begin to describe my symptoms. Over the last 12 and especially the last 6 months my symptoms have been increasingly impairing my functioning despite my depression being well managed. I feel like I spend all day nearly every day fighting to stay awake and even keep my eyes open no matter how many hours of sleep I got the night before. It tends to be especially difficult in the mornings where I'm constantly sleeping through the 6 alarms I set and missing appoinments. I often sleep 12 hours (admittedly with frequent brief awakenings) and then get up for 2-3 hours and be hit with the irresistible urge to lay down and close my eyes, at which point I'll typically be asleep in under a minute, sometimes sleeping for multiple hours only to be awake for 4-6 hours and fall asleep again. 

I don't know if this is even a thing, but I've started having very bizarre unsettling dreams not based in my reality, as in I'm not even in the dreams and none of the people or places in the dream are familiar. It's as if I'm watching a movie. I'll wake up disturbed by the dream but within a few seconds of being awake the dream will disappear from my memory and I'm left with really quick snippets or flashes and a strong feeling of unease made worse by my inability to remember any details. I just know it had no basis in reality and it was disturbing/distressing in some way. This happens every night and it probably sounds insignificant but it's actually fairly disruptive. Does that make any sense or has anyone else experienced this phenomenon? 

Another thing that began over the last 6 or so months is difficulty decifering reality from dreams, either right before I fall asleep or right after I wake up. It's like I'm partially in a dream state but not fully asleep. When I'm waking up I'll often hear my husband or kids say something to me and I'll respond only to find out later that no one spoke. My husband has witnessed me do this, although I've also had brief back and forth conversations with him only to find out later he'd left for work before I awakened and we didn't speak at all that morning. This is a relatively new phenomenon and I'm curious if it's common or not. Does anyone else experience this type of confusion and hallucinations frequently?

I'm thinking about this tonight because my kit for my 2 night at home sleep study just arrived as it's suspected that I have obstructive sleep apnea. I don't think this test alone can pick up narcolepsy though, and I've never been specifically tested for it. My concern is that if I test positive for sleep apnea my symptoms will be attributed solely to that and they won't look further. I guess that would be fine if I started using a cpap and my symptoms resolved, but my brother has sleep apnea as did my mom and neither of them ever had symptoms beyond snoring and needing several cups of coffee to get going. In fact, my brother has more energy than any person I've ever met (even before his cpap) and he's 15 years older than I am, which seems a little unfair but good for him lol. How were you all diagnosed? Was it a sleep study followed by an MSLT? My doctor didn't mention anything about an MSLT. Is it common to have both sleep apnea and narcolepsy? Any tips on how to get a doctor to take your symptoms seriously and test for narcolepsy specifically? I'm missing out on so much of my life and having difficulty even meeting my obligations. How do I avoid spending the majority of my time asleep or partially asleep? I'm not really living at this point, I'm just going through the motions trying to stay awake long enough for even mild productivity. I don't know what it's like ro feel fully awake. I just want to know why I'm like this. It feels like more than laziness and sleepiness. I truly can't control it, even with 20 mg of Adderall twice a day (diagnosed with ADHD). I can take one with a cup of cold brew and go right to sleep for a 4 hour nap. That can't possibly be normal. Btw, I'm 42 if that's relevant. I really appreciate anything you're willing to share.

Hope you're all coping alright. 

I NEED TO OFF LOAD! I'M ANGRY, SAD, AND FRANKLY PEED OFF.

I'm currently travelling around Wales with my mum! I'm 38 and she's 62. 

We're based in Wales but have ventured up North in my new car and staying a few nights here and there to explore. 1 night more South, 2 nights mid, 2 nights North. This helps reduce driving and spread out activities. 

I've had a shock! The driving part (me driving) is a doddle. Brand new car. Cruise control. Basically like a sofa with wheels. Super comfy. And of course, my brain isn't tired and I love driving - I'd be restless as a passenger.

Anyway, we've chilled out. Had nice food. Today is the last night. But honestly, I feel like I'm at deaths door. Every tendon in my body it seems is completely disintegrated. Every bone burns. Every inch of my back makes no sense and is stiff. 

I purposely went to get soft tissue work and chiropractic treatment for weeks leading up to this as my back is bad. Felt great at the beginning of the week. I have a recover session booked for Monday ""just in case"".

So what I've learned about myself: 

I can't walk around a TINY VILLAGE without it impacting my life massively. 

I can't sleep. I'm waking early - like now it's nearly 8am and we wanted a lay in this morning. No such chance as my back hurts. I had to roll out of bed. I want my home mattress topper and proper mattress more than ever right now. 

I was sat up last night with my eyes closing and fell asleep sitting up. We didn't do much yesterday. Walked from a car park to a tiny village (not far). Lunch. 3 shops. Then back to the car. Drove to another village. Same process, slightly further walk, all flat and walked slowly nosing in 4 shops to break it up and I sat down in some of those shops. Then stopped for a drink (1 hour) to rest, took in the views. Back to the car. 

The day before I managed to get the train up to Snowdon because hiking that is just bonkers haha! But there was about 15 steps to get up to the very top of the mountain. I crawled up on my hands and knees and came down on my bum. Maybe I've pushed it too far but am I fuck going to the top of Snowdon and not making it to the very top! 

I don't know guys. I just feel like my body is going to give up any second and that's me done.

I'm having a wonderful time but I'm so sad that I'm like this. I've always had symptoms, my entire life, but this sucks! My mum has arthritis and limitations to a degree. She said she's had an eye opener as to how bad I have it and didn't realise I was this restricted and suffered so much. 

I'm sat on the sofa, crying in to my coffee. We have 2 really easy places that we want to go today. 4 mile drive and the other is on our doorstep. And I'm dreading it. I couldn't get out of bed properly, or down the stairs. How the fuck am I supposed to enjoy the last day of what is essentially a relaxing holiday! 

I don't expect replies but I just needed to vent. I'm trying to remind myself of the lovely places we've seen and the laughs we've had. And making memories with my mum who is my best friend! Paying a bloody price though! üò≠üò≠üò≠ but nothing comes free ey?

1n8yeaf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n8yeaf,Everything I do is out of love [Life rewards me for it and the same will happen for you].,"Usually when I start my day, I start by loving myself. A cup of quality coffee, while I pet my dog and go through my phone. Then I finish up and head to work. My role is to support people with their technology, but the truth is I LOVE helping people, that's the part of the job I enjoy most, even though I love technical challenges too.

Once I have some quiet time at work. I then usually think about the world and all the living creatures and the love I feel for everything on this planet. It inspires me to write posts like this one. Inspires me to spread kindness and love and treat every living being with gentleness, sweetness and understanding.

When I head home, I think about my partner and the overwhelming love I have for her. I love the vibey music blasting as I sit in the traffic. Once I'm home I make special caramel fudge coffee for me and my partner, I greet my friends that live with us and spend some time talking and sitting outside in the shade or sun.

On weekends, I build things or plan light shows for my friends and family, I love sharing these experiences with them, I love breaking up the monotony of life with weird and wonderful creations and personalized events.

As you see, love is a huge part of my life, I love what I do, I love the people around me, I love my home, love my hobbies, love my pets and love life and the living beings around me. I protect and distance myself from hate by surrounding myself with loving people, keeping hateful ideologies out of my home. I seek love and avoid hate, but sometimes I will talk about the hate if I want people to be protected and informed, other than that, I choose to dwell in the light, swim in the waters of kindness and bask in the warmth of those that reward me for embracing love.",1,1757055845.0,NeoModernMovement,0,1.0,False

Thanks to your feedback!","Some of you might remember my post about a personal project I was working on to stop the endless juggling between PuTTY, Nmap, subnet calculators, and a dozen other apps. The feedback was awesome and really motivated me to keep pushing.

 **Based on the initial ideas and what I needed, here's what Ducky can do now:**

* **Multi-Protocol Tabbed Terminal:**¬†Open as many tabs as you need for¬†**SSH, Telnet, and Serial (COM)**¬†connections. No more multiple PuTTY windows!
* **Real Terminal Experience:**¬†The terminal has¬†**command history**¬†(up/down arrows) and¬†**tab completion**¬†for common network commands. Backspace and arrow keys finally work just like you'd expect.
* **Network Discovery & Mapper:**¬†A tool that scans your local network and creates a basic visual map of all the devices it finds.
* **Essential Network Tools:**
   * Ping, Traceroute, Port Scanner
   * Website Status Checker
   * IP Lookup (GeoIP/ASN info)
   * DNS Lookup (A, AAAA, MX, NS, TXT records)
   * Hostname <-> IP Converters
* **Essential Security Tools:**
   * **Vulnerability Scanner:**¬†Look up any software (like ""Apache 2.4.51"") to find its known CVEs from the NIST database.
   * **Password Strength Analyzer:**¬†Instantly check how strong a password is.
   * **Hash Calculator & Cracker:**¬†Calculate MD5/SHA hashes and run a basic dictionary attack.
* **And More:**¬†A dockable notepad, customizable themes, saved session manager, etc.

**This is where I need your help!**

The project is fully open-source on GitHub, and I'm looking to build what the community¬†actually¬†needs.

* **Got a Feature Idea or an Enhancement?**
* **Found a Bug or something that feels clunky?**

Please, head over to the¬†[**GitHub Issues page**](https://github.com/thecmdguy/Ducky/issues)¬†and let me know! No idea is too small, and every bug report helps make the tool better for everyone.

**Link to the full project on GitHub:** [https://github.com/thecmdguy/Ducky](https://github.com/thecmdguy/Ducky)

Finally, I'm developing this in my free time. If you find Ducky useful and want to support its future development, you can buy me a coffee. It's never expected, but always deeply appreciated!

But all I saw was smoke rings swirling slow.

And through them, her face, a ghost against the haze,

Young eyes that held the sun in summer days.



She sat beside a man with hands like knotted bark,

His laughter booming out, a ship in a dark ark.

I traced a phantom line across the cracked veneer

Of this worn table, wishing it was hers I'd hold so near.



The coffee turned to ashes on my tongue, bitter and stale,

A hollow echo of that taste upon her pale

And fragrant skin, where roses used to bloom so bright.

Before the world had chewed them down in its relentless night.



I yearn for velvet dusk beneath a silver moon,

To lose myself again within that hidden, humid room.

Where echoes of our laughter hung suspended in the air,

And I might taste her sweetness once more, without a single care.",1,1757055414.0,AIpoetry,0,1.0,False

I'm accidently catching feelings with a fwb. (25M),"I'm really having some issues recently involving another person after my 6 year break up.

My previous partner 33M broke up with me 30M because of very unfortunately problems. I used every piece of energy I had to save the relationship. He didn't want to try...

The break up was 2 months ago and 1 month of not living together anymore. Its been hell ever since. Although I've woken up, became highly self-aware, I lost everything I loved. Its been so hard. A couple of weeks ago I was at a bar with some friends, feeling down most through the night. I turn around and noticed a very attractive guy, let's call him Billy 25M, I said to myself ""f*ck it, let me give him a compliment."" I simply gave a compliment and asked for socials. We exchanged instas and I went on my way. It felt nice! I didn't expect anything from it. We started talking, chitchat here and there. We decided to meet for coffee and just talk.

He's very cute, kind hearted and we bonded over shared trauma. I felt comfort towards Billy. I told myself that I'm not going to jump into anything no where anytime soon. I'm on a journey to recollect myself, work on myself and rebuild myself. Billy knows this as well. Billy is also in an open relationship, and sometimes it makes me feel, odd? Guilty? Strange? Idk, its new to me. Ever since we started hanging out more, we've grown closer and its been nice. It feels nice, but whenever he brings up his partner, It makes me feel... down? I don't avoid the topic, nor do I avoid the fact he's in a relationship. And I see it as an opportunity for me to practice on prioritizing myself and setting mental boundaries.

So, what sucks is that it feels really nice to spend time with Billy and it brings back the warmth of being in a relationship. It feels so nice, but I'm struggling on not wanting to catch feelings. It feels like I am inch by inch. I remind myself, NO, I cannot let myself fall into this. Its not right. I know my emotions and feelings are trying to fill in a void, I mean I was in a 6 year relationship, of course I feel like I'm missing something. I'm not using Billy either, I do genuinely like spending time with him and his charactaristics are nice. I just don't know if I should get myself out of this before it gets ""worse"". As much as I'm trying to avoid getting hurt, I know its going to happen through out life. But I don't want to get hurt right now, its too soon for hurt, even if its by my own doing.",1,1757055232.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **""SoftBank Hawks: Lighting Up the M18 Trophy Ceremony (or Risking a Glowing Embarrassment)""**

The Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, baseball‚Äôs most overachieving power company, take on the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles in a do-or-die clash for the M18 title. With their 37-17-2 record and a seven-game winning streak (including a September tear that makes a vampire at a blood bank look generous), the Hawks are favored at **-150 to -170** (decimal: 1.45‚Äì1.48), implying a **58‚Äì60% chance** to win. Rakuten, meanwhile, is priced at **+250 to +283** (decimal: 2.5‚Äì2.83), or **28‚Äì33%**, which is about the same odds of me understanding a NPB playoff format.

**Why SoftBank Might Win:**

* **Daisuke Otsu**, their ""ace"" (translation: guy who doesn‚Äôt let pitchers‚Äô dystrophy win), sports a **1.85 ERA** and a 5-inning no-run performance in his last start. If he replicates that, he‚Äôll be the game‚Äôs MVP‚Äîor at least its most profitable DFS play.
* The Hawks‚Äô **20-point bonus** for their 37-17-2 record? That‚Äôs basically a built-in ‚Äúwin this game or your bonus is void‚Äù clause.
* Rakuten‚Äôs lineup? They‚Äôre hitting like they‚Äôre playing with a **7.5-run total line** (Over/Under: 7.5, priced even at 1.83‚Äì1.95). If you‚Äôre betting the Under, bring a thermos of coffee‚Äîthis could be a nap-inducing pitchers‚Äô duel.

I have tried the big hyped tubs, the cheap scoops, the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù ones that tasted like grass, and the stim bombs that made me sweat through a hoodie.

Almost all of them ended the same way.

Wired for 90 minutes, then a zombie.

**Where it always went wrong**

The crash. Every single time.

I would go to the gym buzzing, lift fine, then spend the rest of the day feeling like I needed a nap at 2pm.

If I trained after dinner, forget it. Sleep gone.

**What I actually needed**

Turns out it was not about chasing more caffeine. It was about balance.

I needed a formula with moderate caffeine, smoothed out with stuff like l theanine and theobromine. Ingredients that support focus instead of frying the nervous system.

**The stuff that flopped**

I burned through:

* Budget tubs with 300 milligrams of caffeine and nothing else
* ‚ÄúNatural‚Äù blends that might as well have been Kool Aid
* Proprietary mixes with mystery doses
* Hardcore stim formulas that had me useless by 4pm

**What finally worked**

The only tub that did not wreck me had:

* 200 milligrams caffeine from green coffee
* 200 milligrams l theanine to take the edge off
* 50 milligrams theobromine for smoother stimulation
* L citrulline, beta alanine, and betaine at real doses

No fairy dust, no shady blends, no fake flavors.

**What changed when I switched**

No more crash.

No more staring at the ceiling at 1am.

Workouts felt stronger, focus stayed tight, and I did not have that weird 90 minute burnout after lifting.

I can even train late and still get to sleep.

**Stuff you should know before you grab it**

The taste is bitter. No candy flavors to hide it.

The beta alanine tingles are loud at 4 grams. Not painful, just distracting until you get used to it.

No creatine inside, so you need to add that separately.

Price is about 60 dollars for 30 servings. Not cheap.

But I would rather pay for something that works than keep tossing out half empty tubs.

**My verdict after years of flops**

After three years of trial and error this is the only pre workout that actually gave me clean focus, solid lifts, and no fallout.

You can check it out here: [Transparent labs bulk](https://transparentlabs.sjv.io/kjrqG3).

If you end up buying through my link, I might get a small cut. I usually just put it back into testing more tubs so I can tell you which ones suck and which ones are worth finishing",1,1757054880.0,helpfulguidesreviewz,0,1.0,False

The coffee shop meet ups, bowling and mini golf nights, cozy bookstore adventures, the occasional weekend getaway....banter and running jokes only we would understand, confessions of love only we can hear, first kisses, the way our hands fit perfectly together when held.....and of course plenty of movie nights and home dinners haha. I want to experience everything with this person, and make life into our own little adventure, our very own story.
Not to mention, I was raised to be a gentleman, so I would treat my partner with the utmost respect, no task too big, no task too small. My partner would mean the world to me.....so why shouldn't they receive the world in return? ‚ù§

If any of you are still reading this (and I haven't made an ass of myself yet), then perhaps I've caught your eye. If so, please send me a message saying what you liked about my bio, then we can have a great time getting to know each other!

Ever peeked into your cat‚Äôs ears, saw some gunk, and thought: ‚ÄúUh oh‚Ä¶ is that just wax or a full-blown mite party?‚Äù You‚Äôre not alone. Ear mites and plain old ear wax can look confusingly similar, but they‚Äôre very different problems ‚Äî one just needs a wipe, the other needs real treatment. Here‚Äôs how to tell them apart without losing your mind:

**1. Watch your cat‚Äôs behavior**  
Ear mites are parasites that make your cat *super itchy*. Think constant head-shaking, ear scratching, rubbing against furniture, or even patches of fur loss around the ears. If your cat is acting like it‚Äôs auditioning for a head-banging competition, it‚Äôs probably not just a little wax.

**2. Look at the gunk itself**

* **Ear wax** ‚Üí usually just a thin layer, a bit greasy, dark brownish or black, but not smelly, and generally not in huge amounts.
* **Ear mites** ‚Üí a lot more dramatic: thick, crumbly, coffee-ground-like debris, often clumped together and sometimes stinky. Basically, if it looks like way too much and smells funky, it‚Äôs not just normal wax.

**3. Ask a vet (seriously)**  
If you‚Äôre still not sure, don‚Äôt play guessing games. A vet can do a quick check under a microscope and tell you right away whether it‚Äôs mites or wax. Plus, they can give you the right meds if treatment‚Äôs needed ‚Äî much better than trying to DIY and hoping for the best.

**The takeaway**  
A little wax = normal. A lot of gunk + a very itchy cat = probably ear mites. Either way, keeping your cat‚Äôs ears clean is a good habit, and when in doubt, always call the vet. Because no one wants their cat hosting a tiny bug rave in their ears.",1,1757054330.0,u_MICHUPETUS,0,1.0,False

I took 100 mg of modafinil at 8 in the morning and it was 4:05 AM the next morning and still I was not sleepy at all. Additionally, because I had a strong coffee shot at 11 am and then again medium one in the later afternoon. 

Modafinil helped me stay focused and productive for 14+ hours. I worked as if there is no tomorrow. I worked on documents for 2-3 hours straight. Believe me, I am someone who is very addicted to phone and easy dopamine. But this experience was totally different, my total screen on time for the day was 3 hours, usually 8.
At 20th hour I wanted sleep, but my brain was still stimulated. 

EDIT: I am not endorsing the use of benzo here. I was so tired and I have been prescribed Clonazepam (Klonopin) for situational anxiety. So I popped two pills and then within 10 minutes I was asleep because I had to get to work and I needed the sleep.

EDIT 2: I have a prescription and I will confirm with my doctor if I am allowed to do this combo, for that time being I really needed sleep as I had to go to work.

Making this post for all people in 30s or younger who feel sad on their birthday. Most of my birthday I gave celebrated alone, some have been with fake smile and tears in my eyes.Some we're good, good times and bad times will come and go. Just keep smiling friends. 

I decided few days back that this birthday will be awesome. My plan was fix to get up in morning, make some dosa and coffee, go for Conjuring and later sit in restaurant with good love music and have a meal. But my friends called and they are taking me to a short road trip this weekend. I bought as luxury products as gift for myself. Dressed up in nice decent clothing looking like a doll. Colleagues have forced me office because we are having a lunch. One of my friend is leaving company.So there's two reasons to celebrate. 

I had nothing planned just positivity towards my birthday. And was making my own plans. Fuck this world and sadness. Make efforts for your own self.

**What it is:**  
Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for traders. Signals, trend strength, oscillators, auto trend lines, even an AI backtesting assistant. Basically, it screams ‚ÄúI am a professional‚Äù without you actually being one.

**Why it‚Äôs cool:**

* Buy/Sell signals are clean. No messy spaghetti charts.
* Oscillator matrix gives you MACD, RSI, and Stoch on steroids.
* Trend tracers and predictive ranges let you chase moves with confidence.
* Community is active. You can lurk or ask questions ‚Äî people actually respond.

**Where it gets spicy:**

* AI backtesting is neat, but don‚Äôt treat it like gospel. Real market = chaos.
* It‚Äôs not magic. You still need brains. The indicator will not stop you from bagholding a meme stock.
* Premium ain‚Äôt free tho. $27 to $32 a month, but hey, that‚Äôs like 3 coffees, so consider it your trading caffeine.

**Degen take:**  
Use this if you want a shortcut to looking smart on TradingView while your FOMO drives you. Stack it with some common sense and you might actually learn something. Ignore it, and it‚Äôs just another pretty chart.

**Bottom line:**  
Lux Algo Premium isn‚Äôt a cheat code. It‚Äôs a **tool**. A good one. If you know what you‚Äôre doing, it helps. If you‚Äôre a random ape clicking ‚Äúbuy‚Äù on whatever is green, it won‚Äôt save you.

- All AI inference runs locally on smartphones or tablets, removing latency, preserving privacy and allowing use where network access is limited.
- The platform uses depth‚Äëenhanced visual data to recognise and tally items in real time, even in dense or complex shelf layouts.
- NomadGo reports near‚Äëperfect count accuracy without requiring dedicated scanners or additional infrastructure.
- Employees can perform multiple cycle counts per day, delivering near‚Äëreal‚Äëtime inventory updates to existing ERP or management systems.
- The system reportedly reduces a shelf count to under 30‚ÄØseconds, a tenfold speed gain over traditional manual methods that typically achieve 80‚Äë85‚ÄØ% accuracy.
- Deployed in more than 11,000 locations of a major North‚ÄëAmerican coffee chain, processing over one million items daily, and positioned for use across retail, hospitality, manufacturing, healthcare and other sectors.

Why it matters: Faster, more accurate counts cut labour costs and errors, improving product availability and enabling automated reorder workflows.

I always persisted in my long distance relationship, her dad passes away and then she finally decided it wasn't working for her. Mind you she has been saying it for awhile now. I finally let her decide because she said I need some time to think whether this is for me or not

""Hiya, I need some time to think if I really want to do this again or not.
If you could just leave me be in the meanwhile I'd appreciate it, thanks.""

I pretty much didn't contact for 4-5 weeks. I then reached out cuz my bday had passed. Showed her all the stuff I was working on myselfm During those weeks I didn't have a negative feelings. It was until my bday passed and she didn't reach out. It might seem like she moved on. I sent her that message and it was left on read and I think she muted me after. She also is in the Film industry and they're shooting these days. So she will be extremely busy. Which is fine but maybe she doesn't want to block me. She says she never has but I find it hard to believe. Maybe it was done to her idk. All I have is her number and nothing else. She removed me from What'sapp out of anger from our argument.

I want to call her to make sure she's okay with everything. Didn't do it last Sunday tho. She's the first person who I've tried to make things work out and I've messed up some times by not completely listening. I love her whole being but I think I messed up by not becoming her friend first. Because now I have an attachment of all the things we went through. And I just didn't give up. I kept going. She is telling me she has to take over the family coffee business and I told her I would move to help her out over there. Idk if that got through to her or not. I also said that with 100 ppl percent truth to it 


What I wanna know is that is normal for people to get mad at little things if they're done with the relationship? 

I think if I thought things through more and really understood my partner then maybe we could last 

I just did things and visited when it was her peak work season. I didn't want to be bored when she went to work so I went there was events I would enjoy. But I did this before. Didn't think things through and it exposed my relationship before I could mend. .


Relationships are just simple if you listen. Why did I let so much time go by. It probably is too late.
