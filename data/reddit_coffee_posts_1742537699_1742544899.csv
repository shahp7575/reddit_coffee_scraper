1jgbud5,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1jgbud5/i_know_theyre_probably_wrong_but_my_friends_are/,"I know they're probably wrong, but my friends are starting to convince me...","Hi All, please go easy on me with this, I'm coming from a cautious and empathetic place, I'm making this post because I know my friends (work friends for context) are probably wrong but I was hoping for a second (or more like a tenth) opinion. Basically, I work in a building with a coffee shop in the lobby, and this adorable girl works there and we have a pretty good rapport. A few of my work friends are also queer women so we often get morning tea at this coffee shop together and I at one point, mostly jokingly, asked one of them to watch me order with this girl because ""she's for sure into me"". I was joking because, put simply, she's attractive, I was being goofy and pretending that I was some kind of cassanova or something. But the friend who was with me that day said she got a vibe from the conversation I had with coffee shop girl. 

Since then, coffee shop girl and I have chilled and chatted for long stretches while she's supposed to be working, she compliments me a lot on kind of obscure things, and when I accidentally said something really flirty (I was just quoting a movie and thought it would be funny), she responded well, she laughed and said 'thank you'. Then our city faced a bit of a natural disaster and we didn't see each other for about two or three weeks, until today.

Our chat while I ordered was really good, she asked how I've been, complimented my makeup and it was the normal good vibes. Then she put in my coffee as a smaller size so I'd basically get a big discount and added a smile to my coffee lid in marker near where she wrote my name. I told my work friends about this (none of them were there to see it) and all of them told me that it's a sign of some kind.

I want to stress, I know that the situation's weird, there's all kinds of social complications that come in this situation which is why I have erred on the side of caution and not interpreted anything she's done as actual interest. But after they insisted it over and over, my work friends have got in my head. I would almost never make a move, she's at work, I don't want to make her uncomfortable, and I've worked in customer service, I know you have to ham it up. But to a degree, our chats feel more genuine, but like that doesn't mean she's into me. So, what do y'all think? 

While it would be awesome if coffee shop girl was into me, I would not be surprised or even upset if your takeaway is that my work friends are wrong or being overzealous, because I know they probably are, but they've got in my head. And them getting in my head is the last thing I want, I don't want to feel emboldened and end up coming off like some kind of creep. Thanks in advance!",1,1742544648.0,actuallesbians,0,1.0,False

1jgbnv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1jgbnv5/aita_for_feeling_the_way_i_do/,AITA for feeling the way I do.,"This is my first AITA post ever and there is a lot of context so bear with me but I'm looking for honest opinions here, good, bad, or indifferent so let me have it. Buckle up, this is a loooooong ride but I wanna give as much information as I can so my judgement can be as informed as possible.

Some background, I 40/f have been married to my husband 38/m for 12 years, together for 14, second marriage for both of us. When my current husband started dating his first wife, she had a 5 month old daughter. He was so loving and accepting of her, treating her as his owe from the start. They started trying to have a child together very quickly and continued to try for about 5 or 6 years but it never resulted in any pregnancies. Considering she already had a child, he figured he was probably sterile.

When I was with my first husband I had two miscarriages followed by the removal of a large mass of scar tissue in 2006. Afterward, because of some complications the doctors told me conceiving naturally or being able to carry to term probably wasn't going to happen which I made peace with. After we finally slipt for good in 2008 I had a couple friends with benefits but nothing serious.

I met my now husband in April 2010 and we quickly started hanging out and sleeping together. I was dealing with a lot so I wasn't ready to commit to a serious relationship which I was very honest about. Regardless we quickly became inseparable and had been sleeping each other exclusively for about 5 or 6 months when I found out I was about 6 weeks pregnant with his child.

In the beginning when we first started sleeping together, we talked about the what if's like you do as responsible adults, we both shared that we were both pretty sure we weren't able to have children but agreed that if I were to get pregnant would terminate the pregnancy, (save your judgement here because I grew up going to church, I've heard all the stories, I'm still pro-choice, I don't believe life begins at conception, I really don't care what anyone thinks about it and I will not change my mind, not my body, not my choice so please spare us both) anyway, bottom line, we both knew we weren't ready for kids and I especially wasn't, at the time I was a drug addict struggling to stay sober and often failing. I finally got sober about four months before I got pregnant and have been since, 14 years as of January 2025.

When I told my now husband I was pregnant we both scared and unsure so agreed to take a few days to think about things before we sat down to talk. A few days later we met up and had a really long talk. In the end he really wanted the baby and so did I. We both felt like this may be the only chance we each had to have a child. We talked all night, about both of our issues individually, how much work it would be, how hard everything would be, how we were going to raise and also pay for another human being, parenting styles, all of it. We were having a baby still just as friends. We did however quickly let our walls down, our bond strengthened and we started officially dating, though we pretty much had been exclusive for 7 or 8 months by this point.

We were crazy about each other, he moved in with me after dating about 3 months and proposed the following month but decided to put off the wedding a year or two so we could adjust to this new life we were creating together emotionally and physically. At first we argued a lot probably because things happened so fast but we both felt we had a strong, very deep connection like we hadn't found with anyone else, soul mates. We were committed though lack of communication about our emotions and therefore not understanding each other's feelings was the base of most of the problems we had through the years. We had our highs and lows together, we both had our own issues as well but always continued to grow as couple, always coming out of each low stronger than ever.

Fast forward, present day, our son is now 13 and pushing all of our buttons, teenagers right?? lol seriously he has his moments but overall is a wonderful, caring human being that is incredibly bright and we are both very proud of him. We love him more than anything and do everything we can to give him the best possible life we can. We have continued to grow, each still fighting of our own battles and together as a couple. Marriage is definitely a lot of work but overall we have a good life together and love each other and our son more than anything.

My husband himself is a wonderful person. He has literally shown me how to love unconditionally and is so supportive to a fault, often putting us above himself. He does like all people have flaws. His insecurities often make any constructive criticism feel like I personal attack on his character to him. He definitely gets offended very easily which sometimes make me not want to tell him how I'm feeling. We have had a lot of issues as a result of him having severe ADHD which my son also has and sometimes struggles with. For the record his issues from the ADHD frustrate me sometimes but I do understand he can't help it.

Both my husband and son need constant reminders to clean up after themselves. I definitely have some resentment about constantly chasing after them. I often feel like a maid and I have told them both this many times. They will do things like spill juice on the counter or drop food on the floor and not clean it up, take off shoes, socks, shirts etc and leave them all over the house, as well as dishes and bits of trash. In their defense they will usually clean up after themselves without much complaint if I ask but I usually have to ask and often get a hard sigh or eye roll.

If I'm cleaning already a lot of the time my husband doesn't notice unless I passive aggressively sigh, bang things around, or start cussing about something if I get frustrated. Like I said everyone has flaws and I definitely have flaws of my own, which I own up to. I've been seeing a therapist for three years and am actively working on myself (a lot of trauma and PSTD). If my husband sees me cleaning normally he will at least ask if there he can do and I usually say something like anything you want to do would be helpful. I have a hard time expressing emotions or asking for help. Again I'm getting better but still a work in progress and often feel like a burden.

This is especially true since I became unable to work last year due to a still undiagnosed medical condition. I have too many symptoms to list them all here but the worst is the pain that started in my teens spurring my addiction and growing more and more constant over the years. Though I'm still sober it's been hard, the pain is now constant making walking, cleaning, even showering and sleeping difficult to impossible on the really bad days. Point being I'm not contributing financially though I was a teacher for almost ten years and cleaned houses before that.

Another of the other issues we've had regarding my husband's issues with his ADHD is he has a hard time planning and thinking ahead. Think the kind of guy that doesn't start Christmas shopping until a couple days before Christmas sometimes Christmas eve. I do 98% of the Christmas shopping but he buys gifts for his mom and myself now. He didn't get me anything for Christmas the first ten years we were together though in his defense he was usually very good about getting flowers, candy, and a card on our anniversary, mother's day, etc.

Once he started giving me gifts he still struggled to think ahead often rush buying whatever he thought I'd like which was hit and miss to be honest. I say this only for context, I always appreciate everything he gets me and told him so I just wish he put more thought and effort. I would spend months planning ahead of every holiday to get him the perfect gift that I know he'll love. He has always been really excited and appreciative, if he has ever been disappointed he has never shown it. He isn't materialistic but he grew up very poor and often didn't get anything for Christmas or birthday presents.

Christmas morning I always got so much joy out of watching them excitedly open their presents and seeing how happy they were with what they got. My husband always had a sparkle in his eye which made me feel like he was feeling the magic of Christmas for the first time. Once all their gifts are opened there used to never be anything left under the tree for me. I'm not materialistic really but it did hurt. I often was left feeling forgotten. Like I said even when he started getting me gifts he still wouldn't usually put in much thought or try to plan ahead, which still hurt.

I would tell him anytime we talked about gift giving it was the thought that counts and I would always appreciate him stopping on the way home to pick me flowers for free as much if not more than him buying me an expensive bouquet of roses, I might even jokingly say save your money, go for the walk it'll be good for you lol I would also say things, you know what I would love . . .    all the time suggesting to him little, simple cheap or free things he could get or make me that I would love.

The day before my 40th birthday I was cleaning the house so I could wake up in a clean house, I'm not a neat freak but I just don't like having things like laundry, dishes, and garbage everywhere. I admit I was being a bit passive aggressive. My husband asked what he could do to help so I told him whatever you want to do would be appreciated. He picked up around the house while encouraging my son to do the same and vacuumed. He said he would load the dishwasher too but I was already cleaning the kitchen and had get the dishes out of the way so I could cook dinner so did it myself to just get it done with.

The whole time I was trying not to think about tomorrow for fear of being forgotten on what everyone else made me feel like was such a milestone. I started dinner and joined the my boys into the living room. I think they could see something was bothering me but I tried to brush it off, after all it wasn't even my birthday yet. They were starring at me though, still I kept trying to play it cool insisting I was okay. They kept pressing until I felt a tear roll and quickly went into my bedroom.

My husband followed me, laid on the bed next to me, and softly asked me what's wrong? We're supposed to talk about our feelings remember? and I just broke, all the years of resentment came pouring out. I sobbed and told him I was worried about tomorrow, how his lack of planning and thought had really bothered me over the years though I tried hard not to show it and be appreciative. I have told him before but in his defense it took me a few years to tell him and also I don't think he ever really realized even when I did tell him, how much it truly hurt me.

He told me he did have plans and to trust the process. He said trust the process a few times before I finally broke again and basically said it is hard to trust something when I've been let down so many times, I was trying to be honest. I told him I was just scared of being let down again, how I know money is tight but he could make me something for free which would be more meaningful than something store bought, I tried to tell him how much I loved appreciated him, I told him how much of a good man he is, like I said before he is very loving and supportive But I just wanted to feel like he planned ahead and thought about me.

He reassured me several times he thinks about me all the time and to wait and that he was okay but was he very down the rest of the night, I kept asking him if he was okay, I felt so guilty for making him feel bad because I knew he felt bad about letting me down, we love each so much I know he was hurt, I kept apologizing for breaking down like that, it wasn't even my birthday until tomorrow.

The next day he got me an iced coffee before work and left it in the fridge for me so I would have it when I woke up. When he got out of work he picked up our son and they went to the store. They bought and made me steak and lobster for dinner. My husband also got me my favorite kind of ice cream cake with rainbow lettering, I love rainbows 🌈. He also said there was a part two but it would be awhile and wouldn't say anymore. When he told me he had ordered the cake in advance and thought ahead to get lobster for dinner I felt awful. I kept telling I was sorry for doubting him and breaking down the day before.

I'm dyslexic and this took a long time to get down so if you hung on until the end, I know it was a long one, I appreciate you and I'm ready to accept my judgement, so tell me reddit am I justified in how I felt at all or AITA I think I am? Am I an asshole for still doubting part two will ever come to fruition? I want some outside perspective. I want to grow as a person. I want to be better. I will update again after reading some of these comments if there are any and talking about all of the with my therapist. Also  if part two happens I will update.",0,1742543804.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,1,0.5,False

***1. Grapes & Raisins***  
Grapes, raisins, and currants contain tartaric acid, which can cause toxicity in dogs. Early symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and lethargy. More severe signs may appear 24-48 hours later. There's no safe amount—so it's best to keep them off the menu.

***2. Onions & Garlic***  
Large amounts of onions and garlic can damage red blood cells, leading to anemia. They can also cause stomach upset. The biggest danger comes from powdered forms found in foods like gravy mixes.

***3. Nuts***  
Macadamia nuts are toxic to dogs, causing vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, tremors, and fever. Other nuts are also high in fat and calories, which can lead to pancreatitis. Best to avoid nuts altogether!

***4. Avocados***  
Avocados have a high-fat content that can cause stomach irritation and pancreatitis. The large pit is also a choking hazard and could cause an intestinal blockage requiring surgery.

***5. Caffeine***  
Signs of caffeine poisoning include restlessness, hyperactivity, and excessive pacing. It can increase heart rate and blood pressure, leading to dangerous arrhythmias. Keep coffee, tea, and energy drinks far away!

***6. Chocolate***  
Chocolate contains stimulants like theobromine, which can be highly toxic to dogs, especially in large amounts. Symptoms include hyperactivity, tremors, rapid heartbeat, and seizures. In severe cases, it can lead to coma or even death.

The **benefits of dental veneer**s go beyond improving a **tooth’s appearance**. They present a **comprehensive solution** for dental patients seeking to enhance the aesthetics and functionality of their teeth. Dealing with **discolouration, chips**, or **minor misalignments**, veneers provide a transformative impact, creating a radiant and uniform smile. Veneers necessitate minimal tooth modification, unlike other dental techniques that demand extensive alterations to the tooth structure. The conservative approach preserves more of the natural tooth while achieving impressive cosmetic results.

Dental veneers are **stain-resistant**, which is a major benefit. Porcelen veneer teeth or composite resins resist coffee, tea, and tobacco stains. It preserves the veneers' brilliant, white appearance, adding to their longevity. Veneers last over a decade and require careful care, making them a **cost-effective** long-term dental treatment. One of the many substantial benefits of veneers is their ability to be customised. Veneers are **meticulously designed** to replicate the shape, size, and colour of the patient's natural teeth, guaranteeing a natural and seamless appearance. The **degree of customisation** enables a flawless fit, improving the veneers' aesthetic appearance, functionality, and comfort. Veneers are a versatile solution for numerous patients because they are customised to meet each patient's unique needs. The process allows them to resolve a broad spectrum of **dental imperfections**.

The 7 benefits of dental veneers are listed below.

* **Dental Veneers help enhance the appearance of teeth**: They replace discolouration, chipping, gaps, and misalignment to improve tooth appearance.
* **Dental Veneers require minimal tooth alteration**: A good fit and bond requires a tiny amount of enamel removal from the tooth.
* **Dental Veneers are stain-resistance**: Dental veneers, especially porcelain ones, resist stains. Non-porous porcelain resists food, drink, and smoke stains. Veneers stay longer and look brighter due to their quality.
* **Dental Veneers are durable and can last for many years**: Dental veneers are **long-lasting** with proper care. Veneers, made of porcelain or composite resin, sustain regular use, such as eating and speaking. Porcelain veneers are strong and stain- and chip-resistant. Veneers last 10–15 years or longer with **good oral hygiene** and regular dental checkups. The dentist's ability and the patient's dental habits affect the veneers’ longevity.
* **Dental Veneers can be customised based on your teeth shape, etc.**: The natural teeth's shape, size, and colour match dental veneers. The veneers **merge effortlessly** with the wearer’s smile due to personalisation, making them look natural and attractive.
* **Dental Veneers can help you improve self-confidence**. Dental veneers boost self-confidence by improving tooth appearance. It covers discolouration, chips, gaps, and misalignments, creating a more consistent and attractive grin. People feel more confident in social and professional situations with a better grin, improving their self-esteem and quality of life. The confidence boost improves mental health, personal opportunities, and career prospects.
* **Dental Veneers can be your conservative approach in enhancing your teeth appearance**: Veneers are to enhance the teeth’s appearance. It improves appearance with minimum dental structure change. Veneers hide discolouration, chipping, and minor misalignments for a more uniform smile.

1jgb7iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hernia/comments/1jgb7iw/open_inguinal_hernia_surgery_and_blood_clot/,Open inguinal hernia surgery and blood clot awareness,"Hey dudes. Posting here for awareness, not to scare anyone. I'm a 39 year old male, 5'9, 175 lbs. Fairly fit. Was a college athlete that lifted weights regularly from teen years until mid 30s, and have been running recreationally most of my life. I logged just under 200 miles in 2024 (mostly doing 5K's, I'm Canadian). No previous medical history, other than the hernia. Which I've been told I was likely born with. In the past few years, it started to nag me more frequently, so I decided to fix it. Here's my timeline:

March 12: open inguinal right side hernia surgery performed, doctor said it went well but took a bit longer than expected due to the mass of fat that had descended into my right sack over the years, so he cleaned that out. Discharged from hospital that same day. 

March 13: pain wasn't that bad, discontinued opioid (tramadol) pain killers that evening. Was fairly immobile all day. Noticed my left calf was rather achy. Kind of like a deep dull pain. Thought it might be a strain because I was favouring my right side when walking and putting more weight on my left leg when doing stairs. Also had first bowel movement. 

March 15: didn't sleep well. Woke up with mid back pain and sort of a throbbing feeling under right clavicle. Thought maybe I was getting sick and had swollen lymph nodes or just was sore due to 3 straight nights sleeping on my back without much readjusting. 

March 16: fist serious steps post op. Walked to get a morning coffee, logged a little over 2000 steps. Constipation was at its worse. Very uncomfortable. Managed to have a bowel movement in the afternoon and 3 more thereafter. Pain in back/shoulder was relieved when seated upright. 

March 17: first year of my adult life not having a beer for St Paddy's Day. Back pain more amplified. Still off tramadol, but taking keterolac for pain management, which is just a jacked form of IBUPROFEN. Slept horribly, maybe three hours. Pain would radiate when in the laying down position. Worse when I tried sleeping on my side. Occasional stabbing-like sensation in right rib cage and under right clavicle with breathing. Mild to medium discomfort most of day. 

March 18: more intense discomfort, but still tolerable most of day. Sat stationary on my computer for a long ass fantasy baseball auction draft from 8:30 pm to midnight. By the time that was done, every breath was painful. The more I inhaled, the more intense the pain in right rib, radiating up to chest/clavicle/neck region. Didn't fall asleep until 2 am in sort of a seated upright position. Awoke at 5 am in a lot of pain. If my herniated disc in my neck from 20 yrs prior was a 10/10 on the pain scale, this was a 9/10. Breathing was very strained and spastic. After sitting upright in bed and stretching my rib cage out and lifting my arms over my head a bit, provided minimal relief and managed to doze back off. By 8 am wife told me we're going to the hospital. The pain was so bad, this was the first time I took another tramadol for the car ride since 5 days prior. 

March 19: spent 15 hours between two hospitals, had multiple blood tests, physical exams, an X-Ray, ECGs, checking vitals, a CT scan confirmed a pulmonary embolism that had reached both lungs as a result of a provoked blood clot from the surgery. Ran more tests and confirmed my heart was not compromised, thankfully. Received a blood thinner shot in my stomach, and and was discharged. So now I'm on oral blood thinners the next 3-6 months, and will see where things go from here. 

My impetus for writing this is, if you've had the same or similar surgery as me, you're statistically at a 0.33-6% risk of developing a blood clot. So if you feel anything unusual in your legs like I did, don't pass it off. And certainly, if any kind of abnormal discomfort arises in your abdomen or thoracic area, go see a doctor. 

In hindsight, my clot likely formed the day after surgery when I had the calf tightness, and it only took ~48 hrs to reach my lungs. Kind of hard to fathom that... Don't try and be a hero and endure any pain not associated with the hernia or incision. Complications can happen, and a pulmonary embolism can be life threatening if left undiagnosed too long. I never thought I'd be a statistic. My dad is in his 60s and has had surgeries on both knees in the past 6 years. He never suffered blood clots or complications, and he has a higher BMI than I do. My brother, 3 years younger, also had a minor surgery under anaesthesia a few years back - no blood clots/complications. I'd never even heard from a friend or anyone else I know closely who had this complication post op. Just drew a shit hand I guess. Or perhaps some of the excess fat from the operation somehow entered my bloodstream and caused a blockage or a clot. I don't know. But don't hesitate if your hunch is telling you something is off and not associated with the hernia. 

Some of my other symptoms throughout the ordeal were hot flashes or minor periodic rises in body temperature (it was 38 Celsius the night of March 18). Mild sweating as a result. But not really light-headedness which is very common. I suppose I mistook what was shortness of breath for just general pain when breathing deeply and fully. My honest unprofessional assessment for a while was either a pinched nerve in my mid back, a slipped rib from straining when rising from being horizontal, or that I was so constipated, the density of my innards was pressing up against everything else and putting pressure on my diaphragm, possibly stimulating the vagus nerves or something. 

Outside of all the above, it's early morning hrs of March 21, and my hernia is healing well from what I can tell. I've taken 4 blood thinner pills today. My PE pain is mostly gone by bedtime. Earlier in the day, I took some extra strength Tylenol and my last tramadol at 7 am. One extra strength Tylenol before bed. My 3 week post op consult with the surgeon is scheduled for April 1.

I will speak about the truth dear friends 

Have you ever thought that as humanity we almost ended our struggle and the deep state that did not accept it stopped us? 

I am talking of course about the hippie movement and the years of our grandparents
When everything was pure and people, after dreaming of the end, began to live it

Of course, this was against the big troublemakers and so they forcibly eliminated them

Today, in the year 2025, I am digging up the memories of our ancestors and I come to the following again: we managed as humanity to unite, to mix and to leave personal egos aside and they ruined all of this

Everyone is looking today with their big companies and artificial intelligences (I am also in this but how I will get out, you have no idea, my friend) so all these trinkets of today are looking for the end

That was it and you ruined it

The bookstore is pretty, it's pretty small but considering how much their rent is, it's got a pretty decent curation of bestsellers and eclectic stuff. The bookstore also houses the Nandan Coffee shop and there was a huge crowd and I was so bloody happy to think Ghosh sir could pull in a crowd similar to MostlySane/Prajakta Koli did for her watpad chicklit novel (I don't hate chicklit, I hate derviative chicklit that's getting pushed because she's a creator)

Turns out most people were randomly browsing and some were there for getting coffee (Nandan does make a good cup tbvh). Anywho, a very short queue later got some books autographed and took pictures with Ghosh sir (I work in media, and I have worked with everyone from Ranbir to Shraddha kapoor and never done selfies but he's my GOATed Indian author so was a little cringe) and he was very shy/quiet but was very sweet.

After he was done signing, he was just chilling, so I did something max shady - I asked him if we could chit-chat and then told him my friend who accompanied me was dropping out of his PhD. programme even after finishing 1/4th of his thesis and spending 2 years on it.

Ghosh sir initially was like why you dragging me in this but he agreed with my reasoning that my friend's now too invested to back down and guess when your favourite author tells you to do things you do it. My friend's resuming work on his thesis and Imma make him add Amitav Ghosh to the list of people he thanks. 

Was wondering if any of you have met any other Indian authors and what they were like?

The crush l'once had on her feels distant now, like a story that's already been told and forgotten. We were never a thing, never even close to it, but for some reason, l always held on to that feeling, even if it was just a fleeting part of my younger self.

So when I saw her name pop up on my phone today, I froze. It's been so long since we last talked hell, I didn't even know she remembered me. Her message was simple: an invitation for coffee and a run at UP Diliman.
I hesitated. For a second, i felt that old nervousness from when we were younger, that flutter in my chest. But then I stopped myself. I'm not that person anymore, I reminded
myself. I've moved on. I've had my share of
relationships, experiences, and grown into someone different.

Still, there's this pull, this strange curiosity. Why now? After all these years?
My head is spinning with thoughts. I'm not even sure how I feel about her anymore, or if those feelings even matter now.
Have I really moved on? Or is there still something left inside, buried under years of change?
I try to shake the doubt.
She's probably just being friendly. She's probably just looking to catch up, and maybe I'm overthinking this.
But then I think about how much time has passed, how much life has changed since then. What if we've both changed so much that it's not even worth meeting?

feel stuck. Do I go and risk stirring up old feelings I'm not ready for? Or do I leave it, like a chapter that's already been closed? It's just coffee. It's ust a run.
No big deal.
But even as I tell myself that, a part of me wonders if this is the moment to finally put everything to rest. Or maybe, just maybe, it's a chance to see if there's still something there, after all this time.

M33, 1.79m, 74kg. Living in Portugal. Visual Snow Syndrome as a pre-condition and taking Omeprazole for esophagitis. Drink 1-2 coffees per day(espressos).

By the end of Februrary 2024 I had some days where I felt sick, like warmth around the eyes, weaker or stronger it depends, and sometimes it would extend to the rest of my body. Sometimes adding to this I also get shivers but these are also rarer. With this I also feel a bit more tired and when I try to exercise I get a weird feeling on my skin like it's cold sweating? And also my skin sometimes feels weird, like burning from heat but it’s not warm nor red, mostly in the upper body.

On the onset I felt worse, now it's more tolerable but it is a bit debilitating since I don't feel okay overall. It also makes my VS syndrome worse. Might or might not be related but sometimes I have random vertigo as soon as I start eating but it’s basically on the first bite.

This feeling waxes and wanes around the day, and it stays for quite some days, I've had this for 3 weeks in a row recently. It has ""disappeared"" for a while only to return again eventually.

I've been to two different GP, an immunoallergologist, an endocrinologist and an andrologist since doctors thought it could be:

* Allergies, my biggest allergy is to dust mites, 12.90KU/L, but this sensation can happen regardless of being in my home or any other place
* Low T, I've got 783ng/dL total and 33.28 pg/mL free.
* Low Iron, which granted I had low ferritin due to being mostly vegetarian at 20.8 µg/L, taking prescribed iron pills and now it's over 50µg/L and this condition hasn't dissapeared.
* Low Vitamin D, which was borderline and I'm now taking medicine to improve it.

Vitamin B12 Levels are within range (512ng/L), Free cortisol in urine is 56 µg/24h, blood cortisol is 14.74 µg/dL, reactive C Protein testing and ultra-sensitive testing is under 0.05mg/dL, thyroid is good, no STDs were found.

I also tested for tumors, on which Metanephrine (162.2 pg/mL on total metanephrine), Cromogranine A is 256.0 ng/mL, Beta-2-microglobuline is 1.50mg/L, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is 1.3 ng/mL, cromogranine A is 256 ng/mL (higher due to omeprazole), 5-HIAA is 5.3mg/24h.

Did imagining on thyroid and cervical ganglions, nothing relevant as well.

As you can see I've done tons of testing but still couldn't find nothing that could help. Feel free to question more if you feel that's relevant.

My boyfriend’s workplace in downtown has some fancy schmancy espresso machine and he loves the coffee there. However, some of his coworkers have been quite unhygienic with the cartons of milk that the company keeps in their fridge. 

He would like to get his own milk. I told him to get his own carton and write his name on it but he feels awkward doing so. There is a chance that his coworkers would use a carton with someone else’s name on it anyways…

Has anyone done this? Would you consider this to be rude? 

He thought about keeping the little single milk pods (the type you get on the table at cafes) in his drawer, but I’m not sure if that’s food safe. 

How would you store milk at work? Any recs would be greatly appreciated! Thanks 🙏🙏",3,1742540737.0,askvan,17,0.64,False

Me: 43f w/the following current diagnoses:
   - T2 Diabetes (A1C 6.3)
   - Psoriatic Arthritis w/Psoriasis
   - Fibromyalgia
   - Asthma apparently (no doc ever actually talked to me about this one, it just kind of appeared in my medical record one day.)
   - IBS
   - Degenerative Disk Disease
   - Iron Deficiency (treated with infusions twice over the past 3 years, now showing low once again) w/no bleeding found thru endoscopy, colonoscopy, and capsule endoscopy.
   - Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
   - Sleep Apnia (use auto CPAP)
   - GERD

My doctors:
   - Primary/Family
   - Rheumatologist 
   - Endocrinologist 
   - Pulmonologist
   - Hematologist
   - ENT (I've had 2 surgeries on my sinuses)
   - Gastroenterologist
   - 3 Orthopedics, specifically hand, knee, and foot surgeons.

3y ago, my fatigue got bad enough that my pulmonologist tested me for iron deficiency. In the meantime, he put me on Methylphenidate to combat it. I've been taking a slowly increasing amount ever since. Iron infusions helped a lot, but didn't take care of it enough for me to be able to function for more than 10 hours per day.

I have a long list of medications of course, including Cosentyx, so I'm immunosuppressed 

In November, I got my 2nd round of Covid. The symptoms were fairly mild, and I got Paxlovid right away. However, I just never truly got better. I've been on antibiotics twice now for long and severe sinus infections. And my fatigue has hit an all-time high. In the past month alone I've had to nearly double my Meth.

I sent this message to my hematologist on Tuesday, and was basically told to go back to my Primary, but they'll see me about the low iron:

>Hello! I had my lab work done on Friday, and I haven't heard back yet. My symptoms are back worse than they've ever been. My rheumatologist believes I might be suffering from Long Covid, but that's not something she can diagnose. I asked my primary care physician, but he has no idea what to do.

>Other new and concerning symptoms are
>1) darker urine than usual
>2) I've dropped 7 lbs since Friday
>3) I hadn't had a bowel movement in over a week until tonight. I didn't see it directly, but when wiping it did look a bit like I was wiping away coffee grounds.

>I have no idea who to turn to for this stuff, but since it looks like my iron has dropped significantly since November, when I had Covid, I'm hoping you guys can help. It's just not something my rheumatologist can help with, and my primary just...doesn't seem like this is a priority.


>I also have a higher white blood cell count than I've had in a long time, as well as high inflammatory markers. My rheumatologist started me on a Prednisone taper while we work to switch me from Cosentyx to Skyrizi.

>I don't know if it's related, but I've been having major muscle spasms and cramping in my mid to low back, and my memory problems are worse than ever before. It sometimes feels like I have dementia it's so bad. I'm hoping you guys can at least point me in the right direction to find some answers. Thanks for reading my book! :)

>Oh, I almost forgot. For the last 6 months or so I will just randomly vomit. It will be just once or twice, I won't feel nauseous or anything, I'll just randomly vomit up anything I've eaten - it always happens within 10 minutes of eating my first meal of the day. My primary said it was because I occasionally used a Marijuana gummy to help with my increasing pain, so I stopped those altogether 3 weeks ago. It made no difference.

So that's where I stand. Primary doesn't seem to care anymore, or has just burned out trying to help me after 17 years.

Rheumatologist cares deeply, and would love to help me, but most of this is way outside her purview.

Hematology...kinda blew me off for the most part.

Pulmonologist will only talk about the apnea.

Endo continuously tests my thyroid and such, but he's hard to get in to see outside of the twice yearly checkups that are scheduled 12 months in advance. I will reach out to him if you all think he could help.

I'm truly at a loss here. I live in a small city where there are only 2 major health care groups, and almost no independent doctors outside of orthopedics.

I really think that I need to find some type of doctor that could look at the encyclopedia of my medical records from all sources and try to figure things out. Barring that, what type of doc should I be looking to add to my list?

If you made it this far, you already have my gratitude!

I can post my bloodwork results tomorrow if that would help.

Edit: One more thing that may or may not be relevant, but for the past 10+ years sometimes my cheeks will get extremely hot. I won't have a fever, they'll just get really red. I used an IR thermometer on them once, and one cheek was at 109 degrees, the other was 120. It hurts very badly. For the past week, the teeth on the left side of my face have been hurting like mad, and that cheek keeps getting super super hot. It's never been single-sided before. So that's new. (No, I do not have good dental hygiene. I have 2 broken molars and a ""baby tooth"" k9 that's rotting away. The adult tooth is stuck sideways up way up in my jaw).",0,1742540569.0,AskDocs,1,0.5,False

1jgawwy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jgawwy,Need advice,"Hey everyone,
I’m looking for some advice. I recently got a La San Marco Sprint 95 (automatic version) for free. It’s been sitting outside for a while, so it’s not in great shape, some parts are missing, mainly the front panel with the buttons. Otherwise, most of the machine is there.

From what I’ve checked so far:
The electronic board might still be fine.
Solenoids are working
There are cracks in two brass pipes, probably caused by freezing water expanding over winter.
The heating element is broken.
The pump had a rusty bearing, I took it apart, it might be repairable.
The motor seems fine.
Haven’t tested the flowmeters yet.


I’m a mechanical engineering student, so I’m not afraid of a bit of a challenge. But rather than fully restoring it, my idea is to build a working coffee machine from what’s usable, mainly as a learning project. If it works, I’d maybe sell it later to cover at least the cost of the new parts or invest in a better machine.

Since I don’t have the wiring diagram, I’m hesitant to mess with the original electronics blindly. I’ve been thinking about stripping it down to the basics and designing a new control board—probably Arduino based, just to make a simple working prototype on a tight budget.

Do you think this is a feasible plan? Has anyone ever tried something similar, downgrading or rebuilding a commercial machine like this? Any advice or red flags I should know about?

The dates were pretty much within 2-3 days of each other, but between that time we'd, text a little and he'd call when he was done with work.  After the 3rd date, texting sort of halted.  One of us would text good morning/good afternoon and ask how the day was going, but hardly anything outside of that when I tried to respond with something else. After about 3 days of this, I told him it would be nice to talk on the phone when he gets off and he said he'd call.  He didn't but text back late that night & said he was sorry he fell asleep.  Last night, the same thing happened.  At the end of our last date, we had initially talked about seeing each again and it was supposed to happen two nights ago, but I didn't hear anything.

He did call this evening and apologized saying he had been very busy with work and he wanted to take me out again tomorrow.  I agreed and we made plans to see a movie and talked a bit more.  The lack of texting/calling after being routine kind of has me wondering if this normal and if I'm overthinking it by feeling like he was pulling away or didn't care that much.

Idk yay panic. Lol,"Okay i need advice. Obviously why else am I here. In a year or two im getting married to the man I've been dating on and off for 10 years. (Weve taken long breaks before, like a year break or months at a time) I know, long time, long stress. Anyways, we've never felt like marriage is a big deal, we talked about it recently. He said he was gonna propose to me at different times throughout our relationship but it was never the right time. We were either struggling with trust or financial problems. We always work through our problems. We've done all the work besides taking therapy seriously. We attempted but the therapist felt... not so professional so we gave up on that. It was a weird experience. Recently, I've been excited about the whole marriage thing. Picking my dress, getting my friends to send him rings I like. Hes told me he doesnt know what hes doing so im helping by sending my friends with my preferences so he doesnt have to think too hard. But little things have been causing me panic. Cause once we are married im locked in for life. You know!?!? Okay booktok girls will get where im fixing to go with this. So my innocent baby boys hold on. We have been going to the gym to help prepare for the before and after honeymoon I planned. Im learning some defense moves and working on my stamina. And hes working on his own stuff. For my weird little fantasy I want to be hunted down in the woods. IICYIFU style. (Yes we included fighting. Yes he and i play fight all the time. No face. No groin. We have safe words. Hes picked me up and body slammed me before lol.) So,I told my sister, tell him thats where I want to be proposed to at. She sent him a picture of the ring I wanted and the text he sent back to her seemed... like he wasnt taking it serious. (This is where my anxiety picks up) About the ring. He's already agreed to the hunt as I call it. But I've also been sending him songs to listen to because he said he'd learn to dance with me for fun and our wedding too. One song was 5 minutes long and he made a big deal about me being pushy about him listening to it when it's been 2 weeks since I asked him to listen to it. I try to play other songs in the car but he just kinda takes over and it's stupid that this causing me to feel weird. Just now my choice of wedding dress was 160 dollars and I also wanna be chased in it after the ceremony. He said that was too expensive to be chased in. My ring choices are also well below what budget I think other women choose when it comes to their wedding. There's other things in my list of reasons I feel unscene right now besides the little things but my anxiety comes from the fact that I want my future husband to be obsessed with me. If we get married and I can't even get the little things... idk, idk why im feeling like this. Im a demonic crybaby. Help. 
Also, hes a great guy. He pays for all the bills for this past year since I quit my job. Buys me books. Knows when I need coffee. I just dont want to be trapped in a loveless marriage down the road. Just cause he somehow thinks he can get away with ignoring my little needs just cause he takes care of the big ones. And when we are married there's no way im leaving. And before I quit my job I was taking care of us. We kinda take turns through the years. So everything throughout our relationship has been a team effort. Im getting cold feet and it's driving me crazy. 

(Extra story of why I feel like this. When we took a year break. Right before we broke up he did EVERYTHING to get me to stay. Played songs I'd picked for us. Danced with me under fairy lights. Set up a homemade dinner. He put in the work id been begging for but I knew I needed to leave so no matter how perfect everything was I left cause it took me leaving for him to do it. We got back together because we would go on a date once a week and he kept up that same energy for that year. So I thought he had learned his lesson and I was worth it to him to do this. Im scared cause when we get married he has all the leverage from me. I dont want divorce. My husband and I could live im a damn box. As long as he listened to my songs and got me water when he got up from the box floor you know? I hope this all makes sense.)

•Dreams of being able to pack my future man lunches to take to work with little notes in them
•Positive outlook on life (will be your number one supporter)


Ideally You:

•25-45 years old
•Strong work ethic/Hard worker
•Wants kids and some animals (you have to at least tolerate cats, they're my favorite animal)
•Wants something serious
•Ideally Christian and wants to go to church together (Bible study date anyone?)
•Wants a stay at home wife to take care of the house and children
•A good sense of humor
•Will lift me up with support and not tear me down


Here's a little about what I look forward to:
I'll get up early while he still sleeps and get his lunch ready, pack a little note in there. If it's cold out, I'll throw his coat or jacket in the dryer for a few minutes to make sure he's nice and toasty, get his morning coffee ready in a thermos and a quick homemade breakfast like biscuits and gravy or protein pancakes with banana slices and chocolate chips so he can feel full until lunch, sigh it's the dream. Not to mention when he gets home from work, having dinner ready like my grandma's recipe for homemade chicken and dumplings or my secret recipe for pot roast with blackberry cobbler and vanilla ice cream for dessert. Having him settle on the couch and relax while I clean up the kitchen and load the dishwasher, coaxing him to get in the shower so he can clean off all the grime from the day and throwing the towel in the dryer so it's nice and warm for when he gets out. Then having him put his head in my lap while we watch tv in the living room so I can play with hair or scratch his back. Just the little things honestly🥹 I wanna accompany my guy with his hobbies even if I'm not into it myself, be a presence and help where I can, when it's time to unwind, watch him mess around in the shop/garage or watch some TV together, me reading or writing while he's doing his own thing just enjoying each other's company, ending the night with cuddles as he falls asleep while I scratch his back, knowing tomorrow will be the same thing all over again.


I am not perfect by any means and I don't expect you to be either. What I do expect is good communication skills and for you to be honest about your intentions and feelings. I have some red flags, ask about them after we've introduced ourselves to each other. I'd rather not air my dirty laundry out in public. Ideally I'd love to live in the country or a small town and have a little homestead. I dream about that kind of stuff like feeding the chickens and gathering their eggs and making homemade meals and desserts from scratch with grandma's recipe. I'm also happy to live in the city as long as I can maintain my dream of having a cozy home and packing my man's lunch. Please don't waste my time.

1jgan6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jgan6k/am_i_30f_starting_to_be_controlling_over_my/,Am I (30F) starting to be controlling over my partner (29M)?,"Me and my partner have been together for 10 years. We’re engaged. Life is wonderful. I work from home most days (9-5 office job) and he’s also at home. He picks up jobs here and there (trades person) but his main job has always been our house renovations.  
This is a shared venture where our resources are used for the house. I pay for our groceries, mortgage, bills decorative stuff or essentials (e.g if we need a new hoover I’ll buy that) and he’ll pay for the materials and anything to do with the house renovations. It’s a good split that we’re both happy with. But it’s not about the split or money. I have a problem with how he spends his time. 

His day looks different to mine and I get it, I’ve got to be at the desk working away for my 8 or so hours and he doesn’t have that demand. His day usually starts at 11 and ends at 4-5. Sometimes he’ll work late but it’s not often. On the days where he’s working on the house and actually is working away being productive I have no issue. It makes me feel like he’s contributing to the thing we both want (to have our home reno done where were not living in a building site). On the days (which it feels like there’s more of them lately) where he’s in between tasks., he’s on his phone loads which I think is a bit of a problem anyway. He does use his phone for work for example, contacting people, researching things, buying materials. So I know when he’s on his phone, not all of it is social media. 

It also feels when I move around the house (eg go down to make a coffee) he’ll then start moving about to make it sound like he’s doing something. I’ve said this to him that I’ve noticed this and he said it’s not the case. I think there’s two part to my concerns, one is that I’m concerned over how much he goes on his phone and what he does on his phone and two I want to respect that we have different ways of working but his way of working means that our house takes longer to renovate and I’d prefer in his downtime he’d remember that there’s other jobs he can be cracking on with in between tasks. 

I also have some trust issues with his phone because we had an issue last year where I found out he had apps and was messaging people on these apps (crossed a line types of messages) but we confronted the situation, spoke about it and worked through it. I spun out about his phone the other day and shared with him that I sometimes have this feeling where I think he’s being sneaky. He reassured me that’s not the case and I believe him but I don’t think I’ll ever trust him 100% but that’s something I’m okay to live with.

Could anyone share their perspective on whether I’m being controlling overthinking about what he’s doing on his phone or what he’s up to in the house. I don’t tell him what he should be doing but I do ask a lot of questions about what he’s up to today, I’ll ask him to do stuff sometimes like can you hang the washing out or could you sort the light shades today. I keep a mental note of if I’ve heard him doing stuff in the house and I think it feel annoying if I’ve heard that hes not done much. I suggested we go for a walk yesterday without our phones and we did but he had to bring his phone for a valid reason. I just have a problem right now with phones, it’s addiction and their ability to disconnect us if we don’t keep any eye on it. 

I’ve not edited this even though I’ve cringed at how I’ve worded things. I want to be honest and is like peoples honest opinions. Thank you. I hate the way I write as well and I’m sorry. 

Edit: mini reflection, I think I’m worried that my questions on what he’s up to and my suggestions on other stuff for him to do, and my overall feeling of that why isn’t he doing more or what is he doing on his phone is what I’m concerned about. I worried I’m harbouring feelings and it shows in my affection towards him. When he’s productive I’m happy proud and more giving. When he’s not that productive, I’m less so.

To compensate for the lack of sleep, I've been taking a lot of caffeine as well (coffee and energy drinks).

For further context, I do have a family history of Alzheimer's and cardiovascular issues while also currently being a chronic asthmatic. I've also had issues with high uric acid and fatty liver. I don't smoke, drink alcohol or take any drugs.

I'm worried I may be doing irreversible damage to my brain. Should I get a neurological check-up or just get my sleep schedule back in order and see how it goes from there?

I need some advice regarding dealing with my mother with whom i disagree on many many things. I am an only son. My father is no more and I have to take of her. But i just can't take her thought process and her judgement about how I live my life.

I'll give some examples of how she thinks and what I feel about that, so that you can get an idea of what I'm talking about.

1. She doesn't eat Pani puri outside in our hometown because ""what if someone sees"". She doesn't let me wear shorts and go outside (im a guy) because people don't wear shorts here. I chafe and feel suffocated at crap like this. One thing I just detest is changing how I live my life because of what people will think, especially at a non-issue like this.


2. My cousin brother had psychological issues brought on by his grandmother's verbal abuse. She used to verbally abuse him because he was dark-skinned. And you know what the clincher is, he looked exactly like his father and grandfather. But no-one helped him or protected him the way he needed to. My aunt ( his mother, and my mom's sister) didn't protect him because she herself was a target of abuse by her mother-in-law. She was married off at 14. She had a nervous breakdown once because of the mental abuse by her mother-in-law. So she couldn't protect her children. My cousin had an episode once. And my mother advices my aunt, ""why don't you do some pujas, instead of just sitting around idle?"" And I'm seeing all this and thinking, ""don't these people see the impact of years of mental/emotional abuse? What kind of thinking is this? Are they even thinking?""


3. I got married in 2021. She came to stay with us for a few days in 2023 after my dad passed. I was WFH at that time unfortunately. One day she sat me down and started asking me about our future plans, children,etc. Then she asked me how close my wife is to her parents, how much gold she has brought and who has it, how much money they have? I got very angry and told her that i don't know and is none of our business. I told her that if she wants to think all this garbage, she is most welcome, but I will not allow her to put all this into my head, because my mental peace is most important to me. I am not the kind of guy to ask all these questions to my wife, and will never become one. I was very harsh that day.


4. During my college years, i had come home for vacation. We had gone out, and i bought a cold coffee can. Then she said, abhi coffee pee raha hai, baad mein kya piyega... I don't drink coffee or tea even today. Just cold coffee during hot days. 


5. She keeps saying I have changed after leaving home at 18 for college. I was a good boy earlier. But that's not true. With her I was a  good boy because I was craving for her approval. I tried to be good in her eyes, because I wanted to keep her happy, because she was unhappy with my father. I couldn't sustain this forever. I realised it's not my burden to bear. But because of this, now because I don't behave the way she expects me to, im not a good boy anymore.


6. I don't trust her, because she will cook up some garbage in her head, and throw it out at me, and I'm afraid if I let her thought process influence me, it will affect my relationship with my wife.


7. I had a plan to sell one property in my name and pay down payment for a place in Mumbai. But one day she asked me whose name will the place in Mumbai be? I told her it will be joint in my wife and my name. Then she asked me to keep the new place joint in her and my wife's name. I don't know why she said this, but i decided not to touch any money or property left by my maternal grandfather (my father left nothing anyway), at least till the time she's alive. Else I'll have to be obligated to her.


All these things have created significant trust issues in my mind regarding her.

But the thing is, i know she's not a bad person. It's her insecurities that make her behave in this way. Plus the company she keeps. The people she talks to are of the same kind. No discussion with those people yields any positivity.

I realise after moving out and interacting with people, how important it is for a person to have an identity beyond being someone's  wife, mother etc. I am seeing the negative effects in front of me.

But still she's my mother and I love her. I need advice on how to take care of her while protecting my mind and my marriage.",2,1742538294.0,AskIndianWomen,2,0.75,False

ITALIA: L'ETÀ DELLA MATERNITÀ IN EVOLUZIONE

Negli ultimi decenni l'età media per avere il primo figlio in Italia è aumentata. Mentre negli anni ’80 e ’90 molte donne diventavano madri intorno ai 25–30 anni, oggi la soglia si sposta intorno ai 31–34 anni.  
Fattori come la ricerca di stabilità economica, l’impegno nella formazione e carriera, i mutati valori culturali e l’accesso a servizi per la fertilità contribuiscono a questo ritardo. Se da un lato si gode di una maggiore preparazione e sicurezza, dall’altro i rischi in gravidanza e parto possono aumentare.

CLIMA & AMBIENTE: IL CALDO AFRICANO E I FENOMENI ESTREMI

Le ondate di ""caldo africano"", caratterizzate da temperature che talvolta superano i 40°C, sono sempre più frequenti, con impatti sulla salute pubblica e sull’ambiente.  
Tra le conseguenze troviamo:  
– Maggiori disagi per la salute, con rischi di colpi di calore e disidratazione.  
– Aumento dell’evaporazione e rischio di siccità: fenomeni che mettono sotto pressione l’agricoltura e le risorse idriche.  
– Picchi di domanda energetica dovuti all’uso massiccio di condizionatori.  
Questi eventi estremi testimoniano la necessità di interventi e strategie per garantire la vivibilità delle città.

CAFFÈ E GASTRONOMIA: L’ESPERIENZA DI CAFÉ KIt

Café Kit ha saputo coniugare l’amore per il caffè con un’estetica raffinata e una proposta internazionale.  
I punti di forza del brand includono:  
• Specialty coffee selezionato e preparato con cura, esaltando sfumature aromatiche uniche.  
• Una raffinata offerta di dolci e pasticcini che unisce tradizione francese e delicatezza giapponese.  
• Un ambiente curato in ogni dettaglio, dai locali agli atelier di torrefazione, presenti sia in Europa che in Giappone.  
Oltre a offrire un’esperienza in loco, Kit  garantisce la possibilità di acquistare chicchi tostati per riprodurre a casa l’eccellenza del suo caffè.

MODA SOSTENIBILE: LA LANA DI PELO DI CANE E GATTO

Una tendenza innovativa nel mondo della moda sostenibile vede l’utilizzo della lana ottenuta dal pelo di animali domestici.  
Questo filato, ricavato eticamente e in modo responsabile, offre caratteristiche di calore e morbidezza ideali per capi d’abbigliamento personalizzati, come maglioni e sciarpe.  
Fattori trainanti sono:  
• L’interesse per soluzioni ecologiche che riducono gli sprechi.  
• L’unicità dei capi, che possono celebrare il legame speciale con i propri animali.  
Il mercato, in crescita, suggerisce che designer e marchi continueranno a esplorare e valorizzare questa materia prima alternativa.

SPAZIO: LA VELA A LASER E I VIAGGI INTERSTELLARI

Nel campo dell’esplorazione spaziale, la tecnologia della vela a laser rappresenta un approccio innovativo per i viaggi interstellari.  
Come funziona? Una vela riflettente viene colpita da potenti impulsi di luce di un laser, generando una spinta continua che permette di accelerare la navetta senza l’esigenza di trasportare grandi quantità di carburante.  
Tra le applicazioni future:  
• Missioni verso Proxima Centauri e altri esopianeti, con tempi di viaggio significativamente ridotti.  
• Significative potenzialità nel contenimento dei costi e nell’ampliamento della nostra conoscenza dell’universo.  
Le principali sfide riguardano la precisione del laser, il materiale della vela e la gestione delle comunicazioni a grandi distanze, elementi fondamentali per realizzare il sogno dei viaggi interstellari.

CONCLUSIONI

Dalle dinamiche sociali e culturali italiane, passando per le emergenze climatiche fino alle innovazioni in gastronomia, moda e spazio, il panorama odierno è caratterizzato da trasformazioni profonde. Questi sviluppi, sebbene diversificati, evidenziano l’interconnessione tra progresso tecnologico, consapevolezza ambientale e scelte di vita sempre più informate.

1jgabih,https://www.reddit.com/r/MiddleClassFinance/comments/1jgabih/define_middle_class_lifestyle_and_my_progress/,Define middle class lifestyle and my progress,"My wife and i are in our late 40s with no kids and combined net income no more than 100k since we have been married in 2010.  I had 25k in student debt and we were debt free prior to purchasing a $220k home in 2012. We had been making normal mortgage payments and saving to have a kid but that never happened, so we just started making extra payments on our mortgage with whatever extra leftover we had and paid off our home in 12 years.  At the same time, we weren't knowledgeable about investing but i contributed a little in my 401k.  Since 2020, we have been investing a lot more and max out both our Roth accounts and i just started maxing my 401k (wife doesn't have 401k at her job).  Currently, house is worth about $420k, $450k invested, and continuing to invest and maybe downsize to a smaller home in our mid 50s.  How do you think we are progressing so far as i feel like we are behind with retirement.

We live a simple lifestyle and don't dine out or travel much because we enjoy being homebodies.  Instead of buying coffee or buying breakfast or lunch, we make our own which saves a whole lot considering it costs around $3 for each coffee and $7 for a breakfast sandwich. The cost of tipping and the realization of dining out is outrageous. For instance, a steak dinner with 20% tip runs up to about $100 but the tip amount alone can buy you a few steaks to grill at home and you still have leftover.  As for going out to the bar, its almost $50 per head for drinks and appetizers so buying 2-3 cases of beer and ordering takeout to someone's house is so much cheaper when you roll to the bar with like 8 guys.  We have 2 credit cards for emergencies and pay in cash so we don't get out of hand with running up debts. I work in an industry where i review people's income and expenses and people really need to budget and check their finances.  People having more than 3 credit cards and spending above their means and wondering why they are in distress.  If people who are struggling pull out their last 3 bank/credit card statements and do a line item check, they can save hundreds each month if they just learn to budget and cut their expenses aka 20 starbucks and 20 fast food transactions each month.

How much income is considered to be middle class?  What kind of lifestyle do you live?  Is it travelling 2-4 times per year?  Having an expensive hobby like weekly golf outings?  Dining out multiple times a week?  Or are these the norm and considered needs and not wants?  Believe me when i say i don't have much but i enjoy my life and appreciate everything i have worked for and enjoy my simple life.

Shoot me a DM if you want to chat, see how we align.

Ultimately looking for some or a close mate who enjoys chats, hangs & voice/vid calls.   
Maybe to play some games together online,

Be sweet to find someone who;

a) Is not a serial killer.  
b) Would be keen to hang out at home for anything from a coffee to a casual drink to 15 drinks, music and some video games.  
c) Can tolerate me. ha ha

While I don't judge those who smoke Weed and I understand for some its even a medical requirement, it's not really my thing sorry and I'd rather be open and honest that I don't want it near me or my home.

A few words of warning: If I am enjoying chatting to someone I can be very, very talkative. I am gay and if that doesn't sit right with you, or your masculinity is sensitive about friendly affection we're probably not going to get along. I value my time, and thus am a pretty straight shooter, sometimes forgetting the socially acceptable way to say or ask things.

  
Thanks! You made it to the end of my post! Send me a DM and we can see where things land!",4,1742537715.0,BrisbaneSocial,1,0.84,False
