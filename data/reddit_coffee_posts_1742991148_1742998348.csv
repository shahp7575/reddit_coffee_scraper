Then, he decided to move to another country to chase his dream. I wasn't ready to follow him, I wanted to go abroad for me and not for him. In the end we broke up before I moved there, cause he wanted to emerse himself in his new life and I was keeping him back.

We kept in contact throughout the years, texted once in a while and grabbed a coffee or drink when he visited our home country (like every 1-2 years). Everything was fine until a couple years ago, when, after my more recent breakup, we went out and I felt attracted to him again.. I was so confused, cause I thought I was happy living my life where I wanted to, but it felt so weird having this great connection with someone you don't see often, and who gets you much more than your later partners in life...

I visited his country few days ago and he took care of me, showed me the spots he hangs out, grabbed a coffee and a beer, had a great time. I don't know if he still has feelings for me, I just know he's not been in a serious relationship since (he is a demisexual, if it's relevant), while I have been  (though not for the last two-three years).

I am so happy cause he is living his best life, and he has become an even greater person than he was! I know he wouldn't become himself haven't he gone there, and I wouldn't be myself if I had followed him back then. But I will always wonder, what if...

**Quality of Willingness**  
But now it appears that there are certain things which only the individual can do.  
All by himself, and in the light of his own circumstances, he needs to develop the  
quality of willingness. When he acquires willingness, he is the only one who can  
make the decision to exert himself. Trying to do this is an act of his own will. All  
of the Twelve Steps require sustained and personal exertion to conform to their  
principles and so, we trust, to God's will.

These words put a lump in my throat each time I read them.  In the beginning it was because I felt, “Oh no! The teaching is over. Now I’m on my own. It will never be this new again.” Today I feel deep affection for the A.A. pioneers when I read this passage, realizing that it sums up all of what I believe in, and strive for, and that — with God’s blessing — the teaching is never over, I’m never on my own, and every day is brand new.

**March 26**  
**A.A. Thought For The Day**

Strength comes also from working with other alcoholics.  When you are trying to help a new prospect with the program, you are building up your own strength at the same time. You see the other person in the condition you might be in yourself and it makes your resolve to stay sober stronger than ever. Often, you help yourself more than the other person, but if you do succeed in helping the prospect to get sober, you are stronger from the experience of having helped another person. *Am I receiving strength from helping others?*

**Meditation For The Day**

Faith is the bridge between you and God. It is the bridge which God had ordained. If all were seen and known, there would be no merit in doing right. Therefore God has ordained that we do not see or know directly. But we can experience the power of His spirit through our faith. It is the bridge between us and Him, which we can take or not, as we will. There could be no morality without free will. We must make the choice ourselves. We must make the venture of belief.

**Prayer For The Day**

I pray that I may choose and decide to cross the bridge of faith. I pray that by crossing this bridge I may receive the spiritual power I need.

**Life Is Not A Dead End, p. 85**

When a man or a woman has a spiritual awakening, the most important meaning of it is that he has now become able to do, feel, and believe that which he could not do before on his unaided strength and resources alone. He has been granted a gift which amounts to a new state of consciousness and being.

He has been set on a path which tells him he is really going somewhere, that life is not a dead end, not something to be endured or mastered. In a very real sense he has been transformed, because he has laid hold of a source of strength which he had hitherto denied himself.

**I can’t…. God can…. I think I’ll let God**  
**Guidance**

One of the delusions that keep alcoholics in bondage is the belief in the power of the personal will. “I still think I’m strong enough to whip it,” alcoholics have declared defiantly, just before heading out for another debacle.

Willpower has a role in recovery, but only in making a decision to turn the problem over to Higher Power. This sets in motion powerful forces that come to our assistance. We don’t know how and why this process works as it does. We do know that it has worked repeatedly for those who sincerely apply it in their lives.

What’s needed to start the process is an admission of defeat, a willingness to seek a Higher Power, and at least enough open-mindedness to give it all a fair chance. The outcome can be very surprising.

There’s also no need to be apologetic about our Higher Power after we’ve found sobriety. Nobody had a better plan, and we can remember that other severe problems can be handled in the same way.

*I’ll do my best today to solve every problem and meet every responsibility. If something is too much for me, I’ll turn it over in the same way I did my drinking problem.*

**Keep It Simple**  
**March 26**

>

Service is a word we hear in our recovery program. Service means work we do for others. It’s the backbone of our program. The reason is simple. Service to our Higher Power and to others breaks down our wanting to be self-centered. Service brings us back into the world. We really are part of the group when we pitch in to make coffee, set up chairs, or talk in meetings. We really feel like part of the family when we run errands and help with meals and housework. We really connect with our Higher Power when we pray, “Use me today to help others.” Service breaks down the feeling of being alone that being self -centered brings.

**Prayer for the Day:** Higher Power, help me to be of service to You and others. Show me what is needed.

**Action for the Day:** Today will be a service day. I’ll see how valued I am. I’ll give to others, knowing that I, too, will receive.

Today stands before us, ready for our involvement. And it will offer us opportunities for personal growth and occasions to help another make progress on her path to the future. Challenges are to be expected. They further our purpose. They foster our maturity.

How different it is, for many of us, to look forward today with secure anticipation, to trust in what the future holds! We can still remember, all too vividly perhaps, the darker periods in our lives, periods that seemed to hold no promise; a time when we dreaded the future, fearing it would only compound those awful times.

The fear and the dread are not gone completely. They hover about us, on occasion. They no longer need to darken all of a day, however. We can recognize their presence as parts of our whole, not all of it. How free we are, today! Our choices are many.

*I can step toward today with assurance, reaching out to others along the way, trusting that my accumulated steps add stability to my future.*

**SAFE HAVEN**

– This A.A. found that the process of discovering who he really was began with knowing who he didn’t want to be.

Periodically I worked as a broadcast journalist and reported many news stories on location. I regularly drank on the job and was frequently loaded when calls came in about alcohol-related automobile accidents. There I was with microphone in one hand and flask in the other as I jumped into the news van and rushed to the scene of an accident, just as drunk or more so than the one who caused it. It was inevitable that I would one day become the news, rather than just report it, by causing a serious accident as a result of my drinking.

But suppose that instinct still cries out, as it certainly will, “Yes, respecting alcohol, I guess I have to be dependent upon A.A., but in all other matters I must still maintain my independence. Nothing is going to turn me into a nonentity. If I keep on turning my life and my will over to the care of Something or Somebody else, what will become of me? I’ll look like the hole in the doughnut.” This, of course, is the process by which instinct and logic always seek to bolster egotism, and so frustrate spiritual development. The trouble is that this kind of thinking takes no real account of the facts. And the facts seem to be these: The more we become willing to depend upon a Higher Power, the more independent we actually are. Therefore dependence, as A.A. practices it, is really a means of gaining true independence of the spirit.

**The Language of Letting Go**

**Gifts, Not Burdens**

>

Children are gifts. Our children, if we have children, are a gift to us. We, as children, were gifts to our parents.

Sadly, many of us did not receive the message from our parents that we were gifts to them and to the Universe. Maybe our parents were in pain themselves; maybe our parents were looking to us to be their caretakers; maybe we came at a difficult time in their lives; maybe they had their own issues and simply were not able to enjoy, accept, and appreciate us for the gifts we are.

Many of us have a deep, sometimes subconscious, belief that we were, and are, a burden to the world and the people around us. This belief can block our ability to enjoy life and our relationships with others. This belief can even impair our relationship with a Higher Power: we may feel we are a burden to God.

If we have that belief, it is time to let it go.

We are not a burden. We never were. If we received that message from our parents, it is time to recognize that issue as theirs to resolve.

We have a right to treat ourselves as a gift — to ourselves, to others, and to the Universe.

We are here, and we have a right to be here.

*Today, I will treat myself, and any children I have, as though we are a gift. I will let go of any beliefs I have about being a burden — to my Higher Power, my friends, my family, and myself.*

**Say whatever with as much love as you can**

There’s an old story about compassion, detachment, and Mohammed, the prophet of Islam.

Mohammed had a neighbor who had a garbage problem. This neighbor was a cranky old man who let his garbage pile up and spill out all around his yard. The mess was unsightly, but Mohammed practiced tolerance and compassion. He didn’t say anything to the annoying neighbor, for years.

One day, the unsightly mess from the garbage disappeared.

Mohammed went over to his neighbor’s house and knocked on the door. The neighbor answered the knock.

“I got worried when I didn’t see your garbage,” Mohammed said. “I was just checking to make sure you were all right.”

We need to set boundaries, be clear, and stand up for ourselves. We need to check regularly to make sure we’re taking care of ourselves. But once in a while, we also need to check to see if we’re allowing ourselves to become irritated and upset by nonessentials and forgetting the essential of love.

Learn to say whatever, but learn to say it with as much compassion and love as you can.

*God, help me learn to take care of myself and live with passion, compassion, and an open heart.*

|""*In seeking a sponsor, most members look for someone they feel they can learn to trust, someone who seems compassionate ...*""|
|IP No. 11, *Sponsorship*, Revised|
|The idea of sponsorship may be new to us. We have spent many years without direction, relying only on self-interest, suspecting everyone, trusting no one. Now that were learning to live in recovery, we find we need help. We can't do it alone anymore; we must take the risk of trusting another human being. Often, the first person we take that risk with is our sponsor-someone we respect, someone we identify with, someone we have reason to trust.As we open up to our sponsor, a bond develops between us. We disclose our secrets and develop confidence in our sponsor's discretion. We share our concerns and learn to value our sponsor's experience. We share our pain and are met with empathy. We get to know one another, respect one another, love one another The more we trust our sponsor, the more we learn to trust ourselves.Trust helps us move away from a life of fear, confusion, suspicion, and indirection. In the beginning, it feels risky to trust another addict. But that trust is the same principle we apply in our relationship with a Higher Power-risky or not, our experience tells us we can't do without it. And the more we take the risk of trusting our sponsor, the more open we will feel about our lives.|

(oa na kung oa, pero this i cannot tolerate and do not wish unto me or others) idk, but i don't want to be kept as a secret. as the song goes: 

Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that?
'Cause I'm yours

born to be loved loudly, forced to keep my walls up. 
i haven't even tried getting to know people after what happened to me last year, i don't want to disturb their peace because i was unhealed. i didn't wanna waste my time as well as theirs. may darating pa ba talaga para sa akin? someone who will love me for who i am, someone who will see through me, someone who knows me so well and could read me, someone who decides to love me every day. ang hirap parang every thing today is disposable. either i was born in the wrong generation, or its just that i haven't found the right one. what's funny is that i'm very picky, but i always manage to pick the wrong ones. baka yung the one ko malakas kapit sa guardian angel, maybe i'm too intimidating, maybe i'm too much for some people. baka iniisip nila high-maintenance to baka sila pag bayarin ng nails at hair ko (ang kapal ha! fyi i pay for my own shit) zero roster, zero kausaps, zero kalandian, (10 parcels, 10 hobbies, and 10 coffee shops na dinayo kimi!) and all i'm left with is the peace i once wanted and the silence at night that keeps me thinking about all of this. wala eh always lusted on, but never really loved. 

all i wanted is to be seen, to be known, to be chosen every day, and to be loved loudly. pero wala eh this world is too fucked up for me all i can wish for is to be loved loudly, but i guess we'll never know (iykyk kanye reference) ",1,1742997029.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

I strolled into the unit 7 am on Sunday, humming with my coffee over to the nursing station. There were police walking around with their guns out, as well as our security along with them. All of the day shift nurses and techs were looking around confused while the night shift charge is going back and forth with one of the cops. Apparently a patient who had been discharged was mad at us and called 911 from outside saying “hospital security stabbed two nurses and shot one more”. Thankfully the cops figured it wasn’t actually happening since there wasn’t any panic when they walked in but the idea of getting swatted is trippy to me. I’m hoping this lady gets charged (they were tracing their number last I heard) since one of us could’ve been accidentally shot. 

It’s easy for me to laugh about it now, but considering how many people have accidentally been killed by swatting, it could’ve gone really wrong. ",48,1742996980.0,nursing,5,1.0,False

1jkc52z,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1jkc52z/im_becoming_mistrustful_of_women_and_im_starting/,I'm Becoming Mistrustful of Women and I'm Starting to Hate Them (It's Not What You Think),"To preface, this is not some incel rant or anti woman rant. I think women are beautiful creatures. But as they say, beauty is only skin deep. And I'm not just interested in physical beauty. I'm also attracted to a great personality and a great sense of humor. Honesty, kindness, and compassion are also huge turn-ons for me. Now, I'm not going to generalize and say all women are like this. But I'm also not going to pander and say you're all angels, princesses, and goddesses. Because you're not. I don't care where you come from, what color your skin is, how much money you have, how rich your family is, how pretty you are, how fit you are, how educated you are... you're not angels, you're not princesses, and you're not goddesses. I don't care what Disney and romantic comedy movies have told you, and I don't care what your parents and friends have told you... you're not angels, you're not princesses, and you're not goddesses. I don't care if you come from royalty... you're not angels, you're not princesses, and you're not goddesses. We are all mortals. We came into this world naked and covered in blood. We all used to shit ourselves and pick our nose until someone taught us different. And guess what, we all die one day and our beauty rots right back into the goddamn dirt. So...no one is perfect and without flaws, including myself. These titles of angels, princesses, and goddesses suggest that you're without flaws and can do no wrong, which in turn allows you to relieve yourself of any responsibility for your actions, which in turn fuels the ego. Which in turn equals the perpetuation of trash in, trash out.

And to clarify, I'm ok on my own. I don't need anyone to make me happy. Do I want a healthy relationship? Yes, I do. Do I need one? No, I don't. I have a great apartment in a great part of town. I have a great job that I love and I make great money doing it, and will only continue to make more and more money because I bust my ass at what I do. My photography and designs are also getting noticed and published, and I'm getting photography and designs into galleries and exhibitions. I'm college educated, very fit, six feet tall, handsome, blonde, deep blue eyes, well groomed, and I have a great fashion sense. I take care of my mind and my body at great lengths because I enjoy the process and I like living a healthy lifestyle. I don't drink alcohol anymore, but I do occasionally like smoking weed. I own an awesome motorcycle and an awesome car. I'm not to trying to impress anyone with my car or motorcycle. I simply like cool cars and motorcycles - I enjoy them and share them with my family and friends. I grew up riding and working on cars and motorcycles with my dad, my brother, my uncles, and my friends. Cars and motorcycles have always been huge passions of mine. I'm close with my parents. I have a great circle of friends old and new. I have close friends I've known since I was five years old, and I have close friends I just met last year. I have more hobbies than you can count and I'm really good at anything I do. I don't say that with arrogance. I simply am the type of person that can learn to do anything and do it really well. I play many musical instruments, I can sing, I can dance, and I'm good at any sport or creative endeavor you put me in front of. Passion drips from my fingers in anything I do. I'm a deep thinker, a hard worker, well read, a great cook, and I know how to make people (especially women) laugh. I'm charming, funny, sweet, assertive, and I'm not afraid to go after the things I want in life. And I'll be fully honest here, I am definitely well endowed.

Growing up with a girl next door and playing with her and her friends, I learned at a very early age that if I could make girls laugh, then I could get them to like me. Playing with the girl next door and playing with her friends, I also learned how to be a great kisser at a young age. And I've done great with women over the course of my 40 years on this planet. I've dated women from all over the US and from all over the world. I've dated women my age. I've date women 5 or 10 or 15 years younger and I've dated women 5 or 10 or 15 years older than me. I've dated all types of women: short, tall, petite, busty, chubby, fit, white, black, Asian, Hispanic, blonde, brunette, rich, poor, rocker girls, preppy girls, tattooed girls, nerdy girls, shy girls, outgoing girls, women with kids, women without kids, homebodies, adventurers, religious, non-religious, etc. I've tried dating lots of different women, and it's not just about sex. Sure, sex is great and we are primal. But there is more to life than sex. I have a healthy sex drive. But I find that no matter what kind of women I meet or date, ultimately I catch them lying at some point. Sometimes it's a small lie and sometimes it's a big lie. Almost every woman I've ever known as a friend, coworker, casual relationship, serious relationship, school teacher, yoga teacher, or dance teacher have all tried to get away with lying and accept no responsibility for their actions of lying. I've enjoyed casual flings and I've been in serious relationships and I have lived with a girlfriend for several years. I've had some awesome relationships where no games were played, and when things ended, we ended it through appropriate communication like adults. But many other times I've been lied to, I've been used, I've been ghosted, I've been stood up, I've been kicked out, I've been betrayed, and I've been dumped only to have many of these women try to come back weeks, months, or years later when they see how happy I'm doing without them. But I never take an ex back. You had your chance with me and you didn't value or respect me then, so why should I value or respect you now? You broke up with me once, so why wouldn't you do it a second time? I've also been hit on by MANY women who were in serious relationships or married. Some of my best friend's girlfriends have hit on me! Some of my best friend's wives have hit on me! I've been hit on by women whose boyfriends or husbands were at the same party or bar we were all at. I've also been hit on when their husbands or boyfriends were not around. And these are women who seemed to be in happy relationships and women who were also my friends. I've also been hit on by college professors who were married or in serious relationships.

I'm really starting to not trust women (other than my mom and some select lady friends). And speaking of moms, I personally know 10 single moms and none them are widowed. I've met them over the past 16 years. I do know 1 widowed single mom, but that's a different subject altogether. And I'm also not talking about victims of rape. I'm only speaking about single moms out of wedlock and single moms who've been married. Now, of these 10 single moms, I've dated 2 of them. I could've dated another 1, but chose not to because she was one of my college professors. I also could've dated another 1, but she is currently my neighbor and I see her as a friend only. And I've been hit on by 3 others while they were married or in a serious relationship. 2 of these single moms hit on me while their husbands were at these same parties when these single moms hit on me! And another tried to seduce me when her boyfriend was out of town one Thanksgiving weekend. Her boyfriend was a friend of mine at the time. As of now, only 3 of these single moms are married. 2 of them are in their second marriage, and the other is in her third marriage. Of the 7 that aren't married, 2 have 1 baby daddy, 3 of them have 2 baby daddies, 1 of them has 3 baby daddies, and the other 1 has 4 baby daddies. Shit...I'm going cross-eyed over the math. My point is that all of these women were dishonest and took no accountability for their actions. They were supposedly in happy, healthy, and monogamous relationships, yet many were willing to lie and cheat and betray their husband or boyfriend. I could never take seriously a woman who cheated on her significant other with me. If something is wrong in a relationship, then those people should communicate. There is no excuse for cheating. If something is off in the relationship, then it should be communicated. If a woman cheats on me, then it's over for good. I have zero tolerance for cheating. Cheating is the ultimate betrayal. And I've heard first hand with my own ears as all of these single moms blame the guy for all their problems. They blame the men for the relationships or marriages not working. Not one of them turned the blame on themselves or accepted responsibility for CHOOSING to date/marry these men that they proclaim as being lazy or toxic or whatever other adjective they want to use to rid themselves of any accountability. All of these single moms initiated the breakups or divorces or cheating. Almost all of them are taking money from the men or the government as ""compensation"". And then these women have the nerve to turn around and say they're strong and independent women who don't need no man, all the while accepting lots of money from men. Funny how that works.

And once I catch a woman lying and catch her really trying to sell that lie, it becomes a HUGE turn off for me. It really is disgusting seeing a woman lie. It's disgusting seeing anyone try to lie to your face. Sure, we all tell little white lies once in awhile that are harmless. But I'm talking about life altering lies. Just about every woman I've ever known as a platonic friend, work friend, or romantic friend has lied or has been dishonest to some degree. And because of this, it's hard for me to take any woman seriously anymore. In my experience, it doesn't matter how beautiful or sweet or innocent or shy a woman may seem, she is capable of being a wolf in sheep's clothing. And most women, when caught lying, will behave like children and try to play the victim and accuse you of being judgmental or misogynistic. Most women will say anything to get out of trouble or avoid being put in the spotlight unless that spotlight is showering them with adoration and attention. Most modern women seem to take no accountability for their actions or the life they live. Most modern women are so quick to point blame, but it's funny how they never point the blame at themselves. I've been accused by several women of cheating or not taking the relationship seriously, when it was the other way around. They were the one cheating or were not taking the relationship seriously. For example, I once dated a 43 year old woman when I was 38. We met on a dating site. After dating for five months, she brought it up that she really liked me but didn't think I wanted anything serious. She said she was looking for something serious. I assured her that I did want something serious but didn't want to rush anything and have someone get hurt. I was incredibly attracted to her and enjoyed that we weren't playing any games, and we had open communication, or so I thought. After about five months of dating, she was the one who was still on the dating site that we met on and she was still actively using it... after she accused me of not wanting something serious and accusing me of dating other women! SHE was the one doing the things she was accusing me of. And this woman was a life coach and a mother of two sons.

For a non-romantic example of how women lie and take no accountability: a woman I used to work with always seemed very friendly and acted like she had my back. She is the one who hired me at a fashion company where I worked as a designer and photographer. I busted my ass at that job, and she seemed to notice. I wasn't doing it to get noticed. I was simply doing my job and doing it very fucking well. After being there for close to a year, this woman brought it up that she thought I did too much. She said I was only hired to do certain things and that I didn't have to do all the things I was doing. She said I was going above and beyond. Well, when the time came for my promised one-year review, this woman totally abandoned me and said I didn't do enough and it kept me from getting a good pay raise. She was a total two-faced coward. She would be all buddy-buddy and play teacher's pet when the owners of the company were around, but when the owners weren't around she would talk so much shit about them behind their back. Two-faced coward. Eventually, I told her to go fuck herself and I left that company and found a much better and higher paying job. Fuck her.

It has gotten to the point where I don't really enjoy dating anymore. It's almost gotten to the point where I hate women. I don't hate them in a violent way and I don't wish anyone harm. It's more so about not wanting to waste my time or get hurt again. It's more about not trusting a single thing women say or do anymore. I can understand why some women get sick of men. I'm sick of the bullshit. I'm sick of the phoniness and fake compassion. It doesn't seem to matter how you treat women, they ultimately lie or ghost or slowly fade out or they try to keep you as an option or they dump you only to try to come back into your life later when they see the grass on the other side is not so green after all.

At this point, dating apps are so fucking dumb and a total waste of time and brain power. I had some fun with dating apps in my late twenties and early thirties, but the thought of using dating apps again makes me want to vomit in my soup. I live a busy life and don't have time for stupid bullshit. Dating apps are mostly full of stupid bullshit. Now, I've met some lovely women on dating apps. And I met an awesome woman on a dating app that I dated for three years, and we lived together for over two years. I'll always care about her, but we agreed to move on when the relationship ended amicably. And we're still friends. But I have zero interest in dating apps anymore. If I choose to meet women, then I'd rather meet women in person in places I will already be for me and my enjoyment. I'd rather meet women in coffee shops, the gym, fitness groups, yoga class, walking around town or my neighborhood, volunteering, motorcycle shows, art classes, through mutual friends, etc. But no matter how you meet, it gets exhausting getting to know someone and think there is a connection only to have them ghost or simply not be who they say they are. I find many women will say things just to be agreeable or people please, and once I see that I am turned off. I'm tired of fake women. I'm tired of the dog and pony show. I'm tired of women acting on their best behavior at first and then turning into total nightmares. I'm tired of women whose words don't align with their actions. I'm tired of two-faced bitches. I'm tired of investing time in women when I could invest that time into my fitness, my hobbies, my side business, traveling, writing, playing music, seeing friends, seeing family, working on my motorcycle, running, hiking, taking dance lessons, learning a new language, or going skydiving. I'm finding myself not being able to trust any woman anymore. I don't want to generalize by saying you're all liars, but holy fucking shit... a lot of you ladies really do not take accountability for your actions and always look for someone else to put the blame on. And many of you would lie and cheat on your significant other if you knew you could get away with it. I have seen MANY of you do it or at least try to do it. And I have seen MANY of you get away with it. One example (of the many that I have): I was at a big Halloween house party once. I was there with one of my best guy friends. He had been dating this girl for about six months and I was dating one of her friends. My friend and this girl were exclusive. I had just begun dating her friend so we weren't exclusive. And the girl I was dating wasn't at this party that night. So, at this Halloween party, while my guy friend was in another room, his girl told me, ""I would totally fuck you tonight if my boyfriend wasn't here"". Eventually, my friend broke up with her...for many different reasons. I think she ended up getting pregnant years later by some really great guy who treated her right. I'm kidding. She got pregnant by some guy who treated her like total shit and she's an alcoholic now.

I see so many of you women not take accountability for your own actions. That shit might work with other guys, but it won't work with me. At any point, I have no problem walking away. I'm perfectly happy with my life without all the bullshit drama that can sometimes come from dating women. And I'm not just talking about toxic women. I'm talking about women on all sides of the spectrum - women who seem to have their lives together. I'm reaching a point where I find most women to be a waste of my time romantically. Why invest time in a woman I hardly know when I could invest that time into other things where the rewards are fruitful? It gets really fucking exhausting navigating the minefield of being expected to make all the first moves, while not being awkward, while constantly being unrealistically confident and outgoing, trying not to weird a woman out for qualities that make you unique despite those qualities being fairly common and normal, trying to simultaneously be respectful of consent but being expected to be assertive and confident, struggling with your own life while walking on eggshells to not lose someone's fleeting interest who is actively looking for any possible red flag to give an excuse to ghost you.

So many of you ladies want what you can't have. So many of you ladies want what other women have. I've lost count of how many women that dumped me or blew me off or ghosted me only to have them come begging for my attention again once they saw that I moved on and I'm happy without them. Countless times you ladies who blew me off came crawling back once you saw me happy with another woman. And don't even get me started on how many times other women have hit on me while I'm out with another woman. Most of you women will never admit it, but you want men who don't want you and you want men that other women want. It's almost like a disease. And I've also lost count of the amount of women who had boyfriends but still gave me their number, and a lot of them gave me their number without me asking for it! And that just goes to show how much you women like attention and how much you like keeping a circle of guys around to give you that attention. Where does that compulsion come from? And why the fuck do you try so hard to give a guy your number, then turn him down for a date or ghost him? For example, I went to a party with a friend once. He was dating a girl at the time (let's call her Sherry) and it was her birthday party. I was invited. While at this party, I met another girl there (let's call her Mary). We chatted and made a connection and I thought she was cute. Mary and another girl there who I had met before (let's call her Betty) invited me to a coed bath house the next day. So I met Mary and Betty at the bathhouse on Sunday afternoon and we ended up hanging out and it was fun. It was obvious Mary liked me and we were very flirty with each other that day. I ended up having to leave a little early to help a friend and I wasn't able to get Mary's phone number as intended. Weeks later, my guy friend who I went to Sherry's party with said Mary wanted me to have her number. (Side note, my guy friend dumped Sherry the night of her birthday party because apparently after some of us left, she started making out with someone else there. Once again, another cheating girl.) Anyway, weeks later Sherry told my guy friend that Mary liked me and wanted me to have her number. So I was gifted her phone number. So that means that Mary gave her number to Sherry, then Sherry gave Mary's number to my guy friend, then my guy friend gave me Mary's number. I'm a busy guy, so a few weeks go by before I can contact Mary. I eventually reach out and we text, and then I try to setup a day for us to hang out and she gives me some lame excuse and doesn't offer another day to hang out. Basically blowing me off. Remember, I did not ask for Mary's number. SHE went through her friend and my friend to make sure I had it. Why go through so much trouble to give me her number only for her to turn down actually going on a date? Don't waste my fucking time.

But the problem is, I don't want to be mistrustful or distrustful of women. I don't want to hate women. But a lot of you make it very hard. I'm starting to not even enjoy being around women anymore because I don't want to be lured into your spider web so you can try to inject me with your poison and then bite my head off. I'm starting to not enjoy being around women because I don't trust any of you anymore. So many of you complain but offer no solutions. It doesn't matter how sweet or innocent you seem, most of you women are like a wolf who smiles just before he bites your throat. And like I said earlier in this post, I grew up with a girl next door and I was very close with her and her mom. I loved hanging out with women and playing and joking and teasing and flirting and sharing life stories. I used to enjoy spending time with women, but now I'm finding it to be boring and a waste of my time. I love talking with and meeting new people, male or female. But I'm starting to almost feel repulsed by women. As I said, I'm totally ok with being on my own and I'm not saying all women are not to be trusted, and the same goes for men. But this shitty modern approach to dating is perpetuating over and over, and it's turning good men into assholes. A lot of you ladies complain about men, but I'm starting to think you only have yourselves to blame for treating men like shit and not taking accountability for it. What happened to honesty? I've had to have those conversations with women and tell them that it's not working for me. I don't want to waste anyone's time or lead anyone on, and I'm not afraid to be honest about that. And I'm still friends with some of those women because I didn't ghost them or blow them off. I was honest and upfront. And I sent those women back into the world just as they came to me. I didn't send them back into the world more damaged than when I found them. On the other hand, most of you women send men back into the world more damaged than when you found him. And the cycle continues until some of these men stop being good guys and become the assholes that you fall for and complain about. So, like I said, you women only have yourselves to blame for dating assholes. Most of you modern women are turning good men into assholes.

I know a lot of you ladies will say that the reason you ghosted a guy or blew him off was because you were afraid he might become violent if you ended things with him in person. Well, then why are you dating in the first place if that's what you're afraid of? You should seek trauma counseling because most men aren't violent. And if you have or are dating violent men, then maybe you should do work on yourself and figure out why you keep getting attracted to violent men? What I think it actually is... it's really just another way for you childish ladies to avoid having your little comfort bubble burst by facing reality and having uncomfortable conversations. And by ghosting men, you can hide under the blanket like a scared little child until the boogey man goes away. Now, if someone is being violent towards you or threatening you, then by all means cut communication and ghost them. But there are plenty of really great guys out there that don't deserve to be ghosted. You don't ghost someone who valued and respected your time, be it friends, romance, or business. That is the purest definition of a coward. The literal definition of coward is: *a person who lacks the courage to do or endure dangerous or unpleasant things*. Ghosting is for cowards, plain and simple. Make up whatever excuses you want to avoid having the blame placed on your shoulders, but ghosting is for emotionally stunted humans. If you're an adult and you ghost people who valued and respected your time, then you are still a child. You're a child in an adult's body. And you are a coward.

Honestly, I would like to be married to a good woman some day and have one or two kids, but I am also ok if that never happens. I enjoy my freedom of being able to do whatever I want whenever I want, and I enjoy that I can go wherever I want whenever I want. I'm making more money now than I ever have. I'm in the best shape of my life at 40 years old. Shit, I'm in better shape than most guys half my age. I'm in better shape than 95% of the world. I know what I want and I know who I am. I don't play games. I don't tolerate stupid bullshit. I'm assertive but know when to be gentle. I'm very masculine, but healthily in touch with my feminine side. I stand on my own two feet. I have principles that I live my life by. And I don't sway off my path in life for anyone.

So why, ladies? Why do you lie? Why do you ghost? Why don't you just be honest? Why do you try to act like someone you're not? Why do you say one thing but then do something different? Why do you lead guys on then act so cold? Why do you give a guy your phone number without him asking and then ghost him when he tries to setup a date? Why do you cheat and then try to be the victim? Why do you date a guy for weeks or months or years and then suddenly blow him off or ghost him? Why do you seek drama and attention? Actions speak louder than words, and your actions show that you are full of shit. We're men. We're simple creatures. And we appreciate honesty. Can we stop the stupid games and stupid bullshit and stop the goddamn ghosting? And if you're unhappy with something, then speak up. So many women are so quick to give up on relationships or go cheat. What the fuck is wrong with people these days?",1,1742996766.0,ghosting,0,0.6,False

1. BUST OUT UR CALENDAR AND REMINDER APP NOW AND START SCHEDULING UR ENTIRE LIFE IN!! now if ur like me and you're not the type of person who can stick to a schedule down to the t of what time ur going to eat ur meals THATS OKAY!! i'm the type of person who can't feel super restricted so what i like to do is put down actual times for when my coursework is due, times my classes are, when to take my meds, when i have to go to work, you know things that need exact times and then for activities like going to the gym, eating, sleeping, and self care time i put them in my reminders!! MAKE SURE UR CALENDAR IS COLOUR CODED IT JUST HELPS I CANT REMEMBER THE REASON WHY and also when it comes to assignments and tests i like to put 2 ""alarms"" on them so 1. is a week before and 2. two days before its due. as for your reminders (idk if this is also on android i'm speaking from an iphone user) but make it a widget and place it on the front page or whatever page you look at most on your phone AND IN ORDER type the things you need too e.g. wake up @ 8 a.m., breakfast, groceries, study for 2QQ3, gym, etc. i do it this way so that i can check off things that i've completed so that i feel like ""wow i'm such a productive person"" and it feels so satisfying to the point where i'm motivated to complete the entire list for the day. BEST PART? YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO OPEN THE APP CUZ ITS A WIDGET AND YOU CAN CHECK IT OFF RIGHT THERE. personally, this helps me because there's i don't forget things that i have to work on and i have the flexibility of doing whatever daily chore i need to do at whatever time as long as i just get it done for the day. 

2. WHEN IT COMES TO STUDYING i personally like studying in any place but my own house but there was a time i only wanted to study in my room so i'll talk about both!! in terms of something you can do for both: record time lapses of yourself studying, it's honestly just super cute to look back at and see how locked in you were and it makes you feel like someone is watching you so you almost feel like you have to keep going. MAKE SURE TO GET UP AND MOVE A BIT TIME TO TIME, if you stay in a chair for a billion hours not only does ur ass hurt but you're gonna burn out quicker. YOU NEED TO STRETCH. ALSO KEEP SNACKS FOR LONGER STUDY PERIODS! if ur at home i think it's better to walk and go get your snack but if you're outside it keeps you satiated and helps you focus. it's hard to focus on an empty stomach. BUT BAE I NEED TO EAT HEALTHIER AND I CAN'T BE EATING CHIPS BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT TO EAT CARROTS WITH HUMMUS ALL THE TIME. I GOTCHUUUU. dates with peanut butter have been my absolute fav, it tastes like snickers and makes me happy. i use it as a treat when i'm done a chapter. there's also this popcorn thats SO GOOD WAY BETTER THAN CHIPS and it's by poptastic spicy cheddar flavour (can get from fortinos). kiju juice is also a nice drink to have and guilty pleasure is the machine in mills second floor (also at lr) FRENCH VANILLA IS SO GOOD. I also love love LOVE pomodoro and those white noise type beat audios. what is pomodoro you may ask? well it's basically this method where you study for 20-45 minutes (i personally do 20) and then when that is done you get a 5 minute break. after four sessions of that (80 minutes) you get a 30 minute break and then you continue that process! here's some of my fav websites and an app i really like with pomodoro and some of my favourite background noise that helps me lock in!

studying in your room: MAKE IT A VIBE for me especially during exam szn i put a bunch of sticky notes on my wall in front of my desk ranging from things i need to get done (the idea of crossing it off feels so good), motivation quotes, the life i want to live, honestly a dream manifesting wall at this point helped me a lot because they're very bright colours and when i felt like stopping, seeing a note that says ""ain't no way you're about to get 20k in osap loans, no degree, and no job, FINISH THAT ASSIGNMENT NOW"" had me not only finish my work but get ahead in some of my classes too. I also have a bunch of candles and what i like to do is light them and basically ""compete"" with the flame, it just motivated me to complete my assignment or finish studying for an exam because in my head ""i can't stop until it goes out."" 

if ur at outside: personally i like being on campus early and either at the hub third floor where the meeting room is cuz i like the chairs, lr whenever the conference rooms are available, thode first floor all the way in the back with those individual desk and lights (only night time), mills second floor all the way in the back with the windows and outlet bars and why all these places? because theyre all in areas and specific times (for some) that have noise but not super loud. with noise cancelling headphones i basically can't hear anyone and i like it because i can see people talking or working on things and because i see everyone be ""productive"" i want to be productive too!! when i want a quiet space tho i like to go to mdcl third floor and pick a tutorial room there, usually theyre empty so it's just you. ABOVE ALL COFFEE SHOPS I LOVE A GOOD CAFE. ark + anchor my beloved but they are closing down soon so pls enjoy this gem while you styll can. relay is also one that i frequent a lot, sometimes i go to second cup but again seeing people be productive makes me want to be productive, the ambience is nice, and i feel like because i went all the way to dt hamilton I HAVE to lock in because not only did i travel all the way here but i'm also spending 7 dollars on coffee. 

3. TAKE CARE OF URSELF THIS IS SO IMPORTANT I CANT STRESS THIS ENOUGH how tf you gonna lock in if you haven't slept in three days, you feel horrible, and you haven't touched grass in months. YOU NEED BREAKS AND YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR BODY. sleep is so important and something that i struggle with too specially since ramadan started can confirm my sleep been so fucked up it's been so hard going to classes and doing ANYTHING. you need at least 7 hours. ""but girl i got so much to do and so little time."" I PROMISE YOU THERE IS TIME. you just gotta balance everything out. and i'm sorry I'M GUILTY OF THIS TOO SO I GET IT but we can't be doing everything last minute all the time. if you have an assignment due in a week you gotta start at least 4 days before babez. doing it bit by bit allows you to have time for other things in your life and maintain sleep and self care. for me there are assignments i work better under pressure with so i figure out ahead of time what i have on the day that it's due and do some of those things ahead of time so that one the day of, it's mainly just the assignment i'm worrying about and not a lot of other things. i also treat school like a 9-5. monday-friday i work and the weekends i be chilling fr (ofc with some hectic weeks its subject to change). also highly want to emphasize touching grass. pls see ur friends and maintain your hobbies and go to the gym if ur into that. focusing on school 24/7 is so stressful and leads to burnout so much quicker. you gotta relax your brain time to time to be able to lock in better. it's similar to those moments where the first time you listen to a lecture you think to yourself wtf is going on. and then when you hear that same thing the next day for some reason you just understand it better. 

i'm lowkey getting tired of typing so IM DONE there's much more i wanna say but i will leave you with this. i hope it helps bhaddies and may we all get 11/12s this term MWAH ",3,1742996756.0,McMaster,0,1.0,False

I was back to office after like a month. I was getting my coffee from the coffee machine, i was on the phone ringing my mum, lost in all the learnings and awakenings i had in the past month (phew the month was crazy), i see from the corner of my eyes, someone beside me keeping his mug in the sink. I’m pretty sure he timed his presence in the coffee area. I turned my head to the right, it was him, looking straight in my eyes and smiling. The smile was not mechanical professional politeness, it was warm. My head couldn’t process what was going on, i was so zoned out, i looked straight in his eyes with a blank face for 2 seconds that felt too long, i just remember seeing the circle of his eyes. Then i composed myself, as i realised, he is smiling and i have to smile back, i smiled back faintly. But all throughout the moment, he had that same smile plastered. Like he didnt know himself how to react to that uncalled for stare that felt intense. I am sure, he noticed cuz you notice these things. Then my mum picked up and on the phone i said “yeah i reached office”. He heard that too but he didnt know it was my mum.

I asked my brother and he said men don’t get acknowledged so often, so even a eye contact held for a moment longer feels like validation. Especially if hes a man in his 50s, he said they dont get much attention from younger woman, so everything feels like a moment for him.

I 22F and my friend 21F is friends since childhood. She was the one who I ran every time I'm having problems since I'm broken fam and she's not (this would be reliable later). Let's just call here. ""S"" S was the type of friend that loved to gossip I really don't know if it's real? or just made up but I don't really care since I also loved listening to it.  My family treat her as one of one and same goes to her. We we're like sister but not with blood since I hang out with them for a couple of months, and she would also to my family.

I moved house in our high school years, and it would be the first time ever since we started hanging out that we would separate for long, but we visit each other alternately but only in the weekends if she isn't busy and so I am. She tells me about a boy that he loved or having crush on since 4th grade, and she told me that the boy lived close to my homes. I haven't really met the guy since I wasn't interested, and she won't even tell me because she always jokes that ""I would take her man"" I don't really care since I'm not that interested of relationship and all. She would visit every single day even thoo it would be a 3hr drive every time she doesn't care. S and let call her now boyfriend ""K"" K and S always goes on date and she always used me an excuse to her mom that's she's with me. Even thoo am not but she's my friend so I always covered her back. They lasted for a whole 8 months so she kept on visiting me in the last 8 months and it went to a point that she also lived in my apartment just for her to be close to K, but I don't care since I loved being with her. The whole 8 months, every week ends if they don't have money, they use MY APARTMENT to be THEIR PLACE if you get what I mean. YES that, she would ask me if it's okay to this date yadayadayada that they would come, and I would say yes and tell her that I would be in the cafe down the streets since I don't want to bother them on what they we're doing. After them I would be the one cleaning the place up since they wouldn't clean for it. They broke up for a reason that her mother caught her in the act when one day her mother visited my apartment since she's having guts that her daughter is just lying. Her mom went directly to my apartment and guess what I wasn't there, so you know who's in my apartment. I wasn't able to read that her mother would come since I was busy studying because I have a test on Monday. When I already read it and I immediately call her mother that I wasn't in my apartment and I'm on the cafe down the street and she said she already knocked and her daughter answer. WHEN I SAY MY SOUL LEFT MY BODY IT DID. I grab my bag and things and ran back to my apartment. When I got there S mother is inside and my door is wide open I slowly step inside and I saw S and K yeah her mother saw S with K and any mother would know WHAT would a girl and boy would do in a apartment all alone. I haven't seen K face because when I got there K isn't there anymore so I haven't seen him face to face ever since. She got mad at me because I was supposed to cover her but I failed. I ask forgiveness calling her and all but she always ignored me. I would visit her but S mother ground her so I wasn't able to treat her outside. I was really thinking our friendship would end at that moment, since she's still mad at me and her mother is also mad at me. 

  
I stop and give them space and focuses on my studies, I kept visiting the cafe since I wasn't able to last in my apartment for the reason the guilt that is in me when I wasn't able to cover my friend. I order a coffee and mistakenly drink someone's coffee when I went on taking a sip first rather reading if my name. After taking a big sip, I finally read the name and it was Kevin I was really shocked. I looked around and saw the only man in the cafe and went straight to him apologizing he just laugh and I insisted to buy him a new drink but he insisted to take me to dinner instead. So I agreed just to make up the mistake I just made. During that dinner he was really talking about himseld saying his 40 and he would loved to be my sugar daddy and getting too pushy and wanted more so I haven't really enjoying the dinner so I quickly finish the food and went out immediately pretending I have a emergency. 

after a week S finally chatted me and I was really happy she was the one chatting first and she ask if I would like to be the couch to the dance they we're trying since there couch back out for a reason that they don't know. I accepted the favor thinking this would be the perfect opportunity make up to her. I drove instantly the next day since I was free and started teaching them at first it was doing smoothly; I couches them every weekend to not mixed in the school schedule they would have.  It was about 2 months of practice when during the dance break S told me K and her are couple again. and he would come during the performance and I was excited since I haven't really meet him. The day of the performance came and it went well. We won the first place. After that K ran towards S and guess who K is. ....... I will give you time........ yes K is KEVIN I was really shock when I saw him. and K or Kevin told S THAT WE DATED we never did. AND WILL NEVER DATE, but what S believed what K said, and she called me names, that I had only dated him when they broke up since I has never been loved since childhood, she was saying I wasn't loved by my parents since I only lived with my grandmother since I was a broken fam right. She told things that really hurt me. After all the sacrifices I took for her and that would be return girl I really broke out and told her things I was not should have told. I told her ""your boyfriend is 40 yrs old man and looking for a sugar baby and you're not the only one he dated"" ""am fine having a broken family than a family obviously both parents cheating with each other"" she was shocked to what I said and so I am. I walk out due to anger because I was about to cry and I don't want her to see that situation. Back home she twitted that a friend ""SHE THOUGH"" is loyal which is not she called me A disgrace from my family that I'm only made by mistake and that was the reason my parents broke up and I was left only on the grandparent, she also called I would never be loved and never will be loved since I wasn't really a good person at all I was a snake so on and so fort forgot to mention that she hide me on that post and I had to know about her bad mouthing me by a friend of her sending me a screenshot on the post. I cried and decided to really end this toxic friendship we had and blocked her and her family and went on my life.

If there was one gripe I might have -- which I was hoping for some advice  about -- is the lack of iced coffee (yes, this is a bit cringy). In my home country, iced coffee is quite popular year-round, but I haven't quite found it to be available in Paris. For instance, McDonalds back home serve iced coffees whereas Parisian ones don't.

It occurs when the force of blood against the artery walls remains consistently high. Understanding hypertension, its causes, types, and management strategies can help prevent severe health issues.

# What Causes Hypertension?

Hypertension develops due to various factors, including lifestyle habits and underlying health conditions. Some common causes include:

* **Genetics:** A family history of hypertension increases the risk.
* **Poor Diet:** High sodium intake, excessive processed foods, and low potassium levels contribute to high blood pressure.
* **Lack of Physical Activity:** A sedentary lifestyle weakens the heart and blood vessels.
* **Obesity:** Excess weight increases the workload on the heart.
* **Chronic Stress:** Prolonged stress can lead to temporary or long-term increases in blood pressure.
* **Medical Conditions:** Kidney disease, hormonal disorders, and sleep apnea can cause hypertension.
* **Smoking and Alcohol:** Both substances can damage blood vessels and raise blood pressure levels.

# Types of Hypertension

There are two primary types of hypertension:

1. **Primary (Essential) Hypertension:**
   * The most common form, developing gradually over time with no identifiable cause.
   * Often linked to lifestyle and genetic factors.
2. **Secondary Hypertension:**
   * Caused by an underlying health condition, such as kidney disease or hormonal disorders.
   * Can be more severe and may require targeted treatment.

# How to Control Hypertension

Managing hypertension is essential to reduce the risk of complications. Here are key strategies:

* **Monitor Blood Pressure Regularly:** Keeping track of blood pressure levels helps detect changes early.
* **Exercise Regularly:** Engaging in aerobic activities like walking, swimming, or cycling strengthens the heart and lowers blood pressure.
* **Reduce Sodium Intake:** Limiting salt consumption can significantly lower blood pressure.
* **Manage Stress:** Practicing relaxation techniques such as meditation and deep breathing can help control stress-related spikes in blood pressure.
* **Maintain a Healthy Weight:** Losing excess weight helps ease pressure on the heart and blood vessels.
* **Limit Alcohol and Quit Smoking:** Both can have a significant impact on blood pressure levels and overall heart health.
* **Medication:** In some cases, doctors may prescribe antihypertensive medications to help regulate blood pressure.

# The Best Diet for Hypertension Management

A heart-healthy diet can help lower and manage high blood pressure. The **DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet** is one of the most effective nutritional plans for controlling hypertension.

# Foods to Include:

* **Fruits and Vegetables:** Bananas, oranges, leafy greens, and carrots provide essential nutrients that help regulate blood pressure.
* **Whole Grains:** Brown rice, whole wheat bread, and oats promote heart health.
* **Lean Proteins:** Fish, chicken, tofu, and beans are great alternatives to red meat.
* **Low-Fat Dairy:** Milk, yogurt, and cheese help maintain balanced blood pressure.
* **Healthy Fats:** Olive oil, avocados, and nuts support cardiovascular health.

# Foods to Avoid:

* **Excessive Salt:** Processed foods, canned soups, and fast food contain high sodium levels.
* **Saturated and Trans Fats:** Fried foods, fatty cuts of meat, and packaged snacks contribute to high cholesterol and hypertension.
* **Sugary Beverages:** Soda, energy drinks, and excessive coffee can spike blood pressure.
* **Alcohol in Excess:** Too much alcohol can raise blood pressure and damage blood vessels.

# Conclusion

[Hypertension ](https://metabolismrevolution.com/2025/02/26/does-having-hypertension-mean-always-relying-on-medication/)is a serious but manageable condition. By making lifestyle changes, adopting a healthy diet, and following medical advice, individuals can effectively control blood pressure and reduce the risk of complications. If you suspect you have hypertension, consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and personalized treatment recommendations.

1jkbzzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jkbzzn/the_vanishing_office/,The Vanishing Office,"The day after Chinese New Year, 2025, started like any other. I arrived at my office building as usual, a towering structure with three sets of elevators, each designated for different floors. My office was on the 27th floor, accessible via the last set of elevators—six in total—one of which was right beside a small coffee shop.

I stepped into that elevator, the one nearest to the coffee shop, and pressed the button for the 27th floor. As the elevator began its ascent, I heard the distant sound of a dragon dance—the rhythmic beating of drums, the clash of cymbals, the deep hum of gongs. It grew louder with each passing floor. At first, I thought nothing of it. Perhaps the building management had installed festive sounds to celebrate the Lunar New Year.

But as the elevator climbed higher, the noise intensified. The drums pounded in my chest, the cymbals rang in my ears, the gongs reverberated through my bones. It was deafening by the time I reached my floor. I braced myself for a full-blown celebration outside the elevator. Surely, my boss must have arranged a dragon dance performance. But the moment the doors slid open, the sound stopped.

Silence.

The hallway was empty. No dancers. No decorations. Nothing.

Brushing off the unease creeping up my spine, I walked toward the ladies' room, turning left as I always did. But the moment I rounded the corner, I froze.

The restroom was gone.

In its place stood a solid wooden wall, sleek with dark panels where the door should have been. My breath hitched. This wasn’t possible. Had I stepped onto the wrong floor?

I retraced my steps back to the main hallway, scanning for the familiar logos of our office brands—stickers that should have lined the glass walls. But there were none. Not a single one. In fact, every office I looked at was unmarked, eerily blank.

My chest tightened. Something was wrong.
I turned my head—and that’s when I saw it.

A sign reading ""27TH FLOOR"" was mounted on the opposite wall. But it wasn’t where it should have been. It should have been on the wall by the elevators. Instead, it stood alone, misplaced, foreign.

A chill ran down my spine. This was my floor. I knew it was. But at the same time… it wasn’t.

I hurried back to the elevators and pressed the down button. As I waited, I forced myself to breathe. I would go back to the lobby, reorient myself, and try again. 

Maybe I was just imagining things.

The elevator arrived. This time, I stepped into the one beside the elevator I had taken earlier. As it descended, I tried to calm my nerves.

If I saw the coffee shop again when I reached the lobby, that would mean I had taken the correct elevator all along.

The doors opened. My heart pounded as I turned my head.

The coffee shop was there.

A cold shiver ran down my spine. I had taken the right elevator the first time. I had arrived on the 27th floor just as I should have.

So where had I been before?

Dread coiled in my stomach as I stepped back into the elevator and pressed 27 again. My hands were clammy. I braced myself as the floors ticked upward.

The doors opened.

This time, the hallway looked normal. The office logos were back. The wooden wall was gone, replaced by the familiar restroom door. Everything was as it should be.

I stepped out slowly, my mind racing. I knew what I had seen. I had been somewhere else—a different version of my office. But how?

A glitch in reality? A shift into another dimension?

Or worse… had something been there with me in that other place?

I felt like I had stepped into an episode of The Twilight Zone—a place just like my world, but eerily, terrifyingly wrong.
I never found an answer. But from that day on, I took a different elevator.

And I never rode alone.

A little about me. I’m a tall, glasses wearing brown haired guy working in the legal field, though I don’t get into any courtroom dramatics. My username here comes from my cinematic hero and all around icon Elle Woods. I enjoy my job, which is mostly research and writing, but I think some people might think it’s boring.

In my spare time, I really enjoy reading and enjoying nature. I’m always up for a book recommendation or a good hike. I love to bake as well, though I’m definitely not ready for the tent yet. I just enjoy trying to make tasty things to give to friends and family. I play board games and D&D when I can. I like to write fiction. I’m too big a LotR nerd. I speak two languages with various degrees of “this would offend a native speaker,” guess what they are! (One might be more obvious!)

1jkbvhd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jkbvhd,Second post – Gaggia Classic 2009 fully descaled and opened up!,"Hey everyone!
This is my second post here, and I’ve already gone pretty deep into upgrading my Gaggia Classic (2009). Here’s what I’ve done so far:
	•	Bottomless portafilter
	•	Scale with timer
	•	OPV set to 9 bar
	•	Rancilio Silvia steam wand
	•	IMS precision baskets
	•	IMS shower screen & grouphead
	•	Shades of Coffee steam valve
	•	DF54 grinder
	•	Pressure-calibrated tamper
…and probably a few more I’m forgetting.

Despite all that, I was still getting sour espresso, and the water from the grouphead didn’t seem very hot. After everything I’d already done to the machine, I felt confident enough to take it even further.

So I fully disassembled the machine, removed the boiler, and gave it a proper internal descale. There was visible scale buildup—not horrible, but enough to affect performance. I also found a few loose flakes of scale, probably shaken loose during my first descale. Good thing I opened it up now—those bits could’ve easily clogged up the system later on I guess.

After cleaning and reassembly, I measured the brew water temperature with a kitchen thermometer, and it’s now about 8°C hotter than before. When I flush water after the machine is up to temp, I get a proper cloud of steam from the grouphead, which never happened before. The difference is huge.

Maybe smarter to only use bottled water in the future for less scale buildup 

I’m thinking a PID install is next. It already feels like the missing piece, and now that I’m comfortable pulling the boiler, I’m ready for it.",7,1742995996.0,gaggiaclassic,5,1.0,False

Before diving into specific models,let's outline the key features you should consider when selecting a Philips espresso machine:

*   **Milk Frothing System:** Do you enjoy cappuccinos,lattes,or other milk-based espresso drinks? If so,the milk frothing system is a crucial consideration. Philips offers two main types:

    *   **Classic Milk Frother:** This manual frother allows you to create frothed milk using a steam wand. It requires some practice but gives you more control over the texture and consistency of the foam. Good maintenance also keeps these wands clean after use.*   **LatteGo:** Philips' patented lattego system is an automatic milk frother that mixes milk and air at high speed to create a silky-smooth, dense foam. It's incredibly easy to use and clean, making it a popular choice for busy individuals.the lattego system, in particular, is designed for ease of cleaning, with no tubes or hidden parts.

*   **Bean Grinder:** The quality of the bean grinder considerably impacts the taste of your espresso. philips espresso machines typically use ceramic grinders, which are known for their durability and consistent grinding performance.

*   **AquaClean Filter:** The aquaclean filter removes impurities from the water, preventing scale buildup and extending the lifespan of your machine. It also improves the taste of your coffee. Regular replacement of the AquaClean filter is essential for maintaining optimal performance.
*   **Digital Display:** A clear and intuitive digital display makes it easy to navigate the machine's settings, select your desired beverage, and monitor the brewing process. The digital display is key to accessing customisable settings.
*   **Customization Options:** Depending on the model, you may be able to customize various parameters, such as coffee strength, water temperature, and milk foam density, to tailor your espresso to your personal preferences. The more you can customize, the more control you have about creating your perfect cup of coffee.
*   **Ease of Cleaning:** Cleaning an espresso machine can be a chore, so look for models with easy-to-remove parts and dishwasher-safe components. The machines often have automatic cleaning cycles to simplify maintenance.
*   **Warranty and Customer Support:** A comprehensive warranty and readily available customer support can provide peace of mind and ensure that you can get help if you encounter any issues with your machine.

Context:

* Australian-born Vietnamese based in Melbourne, Australia. 
* I've experienced rejection from girls from a variety of ethnicities in Australia, so I'm no stranger to rejection.
* However, I'm used to phrases like: ""Sorry, I'm not interested"", ""Sorry, I have a boyfriend"" or ""Let's be friends"". I think Australians are a little more direct about it.
* Over the past ~2 years, I've asked 3 VN girls out for coffee or to hang out some time and the response has interestingly been the same ""I'll think about it""
* Initially, I was happy with the response because it seemed like it's a ""maybe"" and that she might get back to me at a later stage, but after asking out 2/3 of the girls a 2nd time a month or two later, I was met with the same response ""I'll think about it"".
* After asking around, it seems like this is their polite way of saying ""no"" that I was quite unfamiliar with as I was born in Australia.
* Thought I'd share this with any expats, Westernised-Vietnamese people or just people in general that plan on asking a Vietnamese person out in this subreddit! :)",5,1742995315.0,VietNam,14,0.63,False

I've lived alone with my ADHD and low-needs autism for most of my adult life and it's generally been good for me, letting me adjust my environment in so many tiny ways that all help enable me to function. Things like having everything for my evening routine in a little caddy right by the sink, or my medication by the coffee machine so I remembered to take it in the morning. Obviously it all falls apart sometimes and it can take a lot of effort or help to dig myself out of a mess, but I think we all know that one.

I moved in with my two lovely partners about a year ago, and honestly it's been rough on me. They're both very accepting of how I am, likely being neurodivergent too, so at least unmasking hasn't been an issue. But I'm starting to realise just how much tiny details can throw me off, like someone using the bathroom right as I wanted to do my evening routine massively disrupting it. Likewise, I obviously have to be considerate of them too and it can feel quite... overwhelming? I struggle to figure myself out on the best of days, and having to worry about how my every action might affect my loved ones is very stressful.

I'm also painfully aware of change generally being hard on people like me, so I worry it's just that and I'm misattributing what's really starting to feel like an incoming burnout.

I have a 3 years old Jura E8 and suddenly after replacing the Claris filter, the pump start making a lot of noise. Afterwards it worked fine again.

After a few days, suddenly the water pressure when making hot water or coffee was very low.  
The machine gave all the time the error ""machine filling""

I suspected a blocked or clogged hose. I dismantled the hoses, checked and cleaned the flow meter and pressure membrane, all fine.  
I tested the pump with the hoses disconnected, and it still worked, but the pressure was very low.

I ordered a new pump (it is a generic pump, so don't order from Jura): SYSKO SPX.H100, it's about 30 euro in EU.

Replacing the pump is very easy, and afterwards my Jura was brewing coffee as before!

I'm Elias, 21yr old guy from Norway. I have recently logged in to this account two days ago after 5+ years and thought why not message random people on the internet like I used to when I was a teenager? But I realised I've grown older (and hopefully wiser) for shitposting memes and fleeting artifical relationships that end up nowhere. 

So I come to this subreddit to seek like-minded people, those who are tired of how fast-paced the world has become, of meanignless conversations, of instant messaging and short-form contents. I want to write long letters and sketch random little things I see and discuss about our favorite books, music, people, places and everything else in between. I'm looking for somebody to talk to about our daily lives even if nothing noteworthy has happened.

I don't want to spoil much about myself but here's a gist about me: I recently finished my associate's degree in aviation mechanic last year but realised it's a career I would rather put off at a later time. I've decided to enroll in both arts and film studies this school year which is more aligned to my interest. While eagerly waiting for that, I have all the time to catch up with my friends, to travel, and spend some alone time, which I never knew I needed. 

I'm in the process of moving til the next 2-3 months, so the option of snail mailing is off for anybody outside Norway. For now, let's settle on corresponding through email or Reddit messages instead. I'll gladly talk to anybody but please be 18+.

I told him to fuck off with tears in my eyes and went to bed. He slept on the couch on his own accord and he has never done that before as opposed to apologizing to me.

1jkb8i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1jkb8i9/its_not_all_coffee_creamer/,It's not all Coffee & Creamer,"Ah, the dream of starting your own web agency! The sweet smell of independence, the joy of being your own boss, and the luxury of working in your pj's while sipping artisanal coffee. Sounds like a dream, right?   


Right?   


Welcome to the real world, where the coffee turns cold, the creamer runs out, and your biggest client ghosts you faster than a dodgy Tinder date.

Starting a web agency isn’t all about coding in cozy cafés and collecting stacks of cash for making ‘simple’ websites. No, no, my friend. It’s a rollercoaster of thrilling highs and gut-wrenching lows. Let’s talk about what it really takes to keep your agency afloat.

**The Clients Who Want the World (for $50)**

Ah yes, the ever-charming client who wants an “easy” website that “shouldn’t take long” but also requires a custom-built, AI-powered e-commerce platform that syncs with their WhatsApp, plays music, and predicts the future. All for the price of a Coke and a Pie. You’ll soon realize that the hardest part of running a web agency isn’t the actual web design—it’s managing expectations.

**The Payment Tango**

Sending invoices is fun. Chasing invoices? Not so much. Clients will come up with all sorts of excuses:



* “Oh, I thought I already paid you.”
* “Can I EFT you next month? My dog ate my WiFi.”
* “I love the site, but my business partner (who I’ve never mentioned before) thinks we should hold off.”



Your bank account, meanwhile, sits there looking like tumbleweeds rolling through the Karoo.

**The Great “Exposure” Con**

There’s always that one client who offers to pay you in “exposure.” You know, because once you’ve been ‘exposed,’ Woolworths will just hand you groceries for free, and Eskom will decide your electricity is on the house. Spoiler alert: exposure doesn’t pay the rent.

**The Scope Creep Nightmare**

One day, you’re building a simple website. The next, you’re redesigning their logo, fixing their printer, managing their Instagram, and being asked, “Can you quickly make an app?” The answer is no. No, you cannot “quickly” make an app.

**The Technical Gremlins**

You’ve finally finished the website. It’s looking beautiful. Then, BOOM—something breaks. The client swears they didn’t touch anything, but somehow their website now looks like a Picasso painting. Was it the server? A rogue plugin? A ghost in the machine? Who knows! But guess who has to fix it at 2 AM? (Hint: It’s not them.)

**The Sweet Taste of Victory**

For all the chaos, nothing beats the feeling of launching a website and seeing a happy client sing your praises. The struggle is real, but so is the satisfaction of knowing you built something from scratch and made it work.

So yes, running a web agency is tough. But if you can handle the madness, keep the invoices flowing, and remember to always keep an emergency stash of coffee and creamer, you just might make it.

And hey, if all else fails, there’s always the option of becoming a motivational speaker about the dangers of freelance web design. Just make sure you get paid upfront. 😉",0,1742994138.0,smallbusiness,9,0.14,False

We've all been there, holding onto an idea like it's the last slice of pizza at a party, even when it’s gone cold and maybe just a tad questionable. But how do you figure out if it's worth riding that roller coaster to the last loop, or if it’s time to gracefully exit the car and embrace something fresh?

First, let’s talk about prayer and reflection. Think of it as a spiritual GPS. You want it recalibrated, right? Spend some quiet time, maybe while sipping on your morning coffee (or whatever fuel you need to get going these days), and invite God into the conversation. Ask for clarity. Seriously, lay it all out—your hopes, your fears, even your doubts. You could say something like, “Hey God, I’m stuck. Is this idea worth pursuing, or am I just chasing my tail like a dog at the park?” You might even consider journaling your thoughts—trust me, putting pen to paper can sometimes unlock the door to insights you didn’t even know were hiding in there.

Another angle to consider is community. Do you have trusted friends or mentors? Gather them, and as you sit in the living room, maybe elbow-deep in chips and salsa, share your struggle. They might see something you don’t—or they might just change the subject to the latest binge-worthy show and suddenly you realize your idea was as tired as that last season of your favorite series. Seriously, feedback can be like the refreshing breeze on a hot summer day, or a refreshing slap in the face when you need it. 

Next, think about the emotional resonance of your idea. Does it still light a fire in your heart? Or have you been forcing a spark from a damp matchbook? If your passion has dwindled, it’s time to honestly assess. Sometimes God nudges us towards new paths as part of our journey in faith. Scripture has a way of reminding us that His plans are often bigger than the ones we can dream up—like in Jeremiah 29:11, which says He knows the plans He has for us, plans to prosper us and not to harm us. So, really, is clinging to that struggle worth it if His intentions could lead you to something far more fulfilling?

Finally, embrace the possibility of a pivot. It doesn’t mean failure; it could just be a divine redirection. Sometimes our most significant growth comes from being open to that shift—like choosing to try a new recipe instead of eating the same burnt-out dish every week. So, whether you decide to stick to your original idea with newfound determination or pivot to a fresh venture, make sure you’re anchored in prayer, grounded in community, and vibrating with passion.

So, which will it be? Dig deep and discern, my friends, because life’s too short to waste on stale ideas—or, let’s be real, burnt pizza. You're not just creating; you're engaging in a journey that transforms your soul, and, by extension, can transform others too. Trust the process, lean on your faith, and remember, sometimes the best stories start on the most unexpected paths.",1,1742994096.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

For all the chaos, nothing beats the feeling of launching a website and seeing a happy client sing your praises. The struggle is real, but so is the satisfaction of knowing you built something from scratch and made it work.

So yes, running a web agency is tough. But if you can handle the madness, keep the invoices flowing, and remember to always keep an emergency stash of coffee and creamer, you just might make it.

And hey, if all else fails, there’s always the option of becoming a motivational speaker about the dangers of freelance web design. Just make sure you get paid upfront. 😉

I feel like my blood works correctly and I know that sentence doesn’t make any sense but it’s like my heart is working and my blood is circulating right and everything feels “open” and it gives me a sense of euphoria (I think this might be a result of being able to breathe correctly ngl)

I’m able to study without getting distracted, feel more present, more aware. 

I’ve tried googling it and apparently reactine contains pseudoephedrine which is a stimulant and is chemically similar to meth or something like that. 
I’m unsure if it’s normal to experience so much of the “stimulant effect” or if I should stop and switch medications. Obviously I feel great subjectively and have a lot of energy and focus, I can study, my house is clean, but idk if it’s bad for me. It’s also the one that works best for me in terms of congestion and allergies..

Idk if this information is helpful but: I also drink a lot of coffee so maybe it’s a weird reaction with that. And apparently reactine increases blood pressure too so maybe me feeling like “my heart works correctly” might mean i have low blood pressure and am accidentally fixing it?? I also read people with hyperthyroidism shouldn’t take it, I have hypothyroidism so maybe there’s something there too idk. I’m seeing my doctor soon for unrelated reasons so I will ask about it, I was just curious if anyone had an explanation or experienced a similar effect.

1jkb18e,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/comments/1jkb18e/daisaku_ikedas_lecture_on_the_opening_of_the_eyes/,Daisaku Ikeda’s lecture on “The Opening of the Eyes”: Opening Our Eyes to Nichiren’s Compassion. Post #24,"*‘Opening of the Eyes’—A Call to Open Our Eyes to Nichiren*: March 2025 installment of Ikeda Sensei’s lecture on [The Opening of the Eyes](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/opening-of-the-eyes-a-call-to-open-our-eyes-to-nichiren-to-open-our-eyes-to-the-people/). Today I begin reflecting on Section 9, the final section in the March LB, “A Movement That Seeks To Enable All To Reveal Their Buddha Nature.” 

*For readers betting on who posts first, Guy or me, it’s not a fair contest today. Guy had a very early meeting with a prospective family at Longhouse Elem. Hopefully, this will be the 10th student for our opening class (out of a target of 12 1st/2nd grade enrollees). Guy said he will post later in the day.*

Sensei is bringing this part of the lecture to a beautiful landing. Here is his first point.

>Essentially, then, to correctly read “The Opening of the Eyes” is to recognize Nichiren Daishonin as our model for attaining Buddhahood in the Latter Day and as the lord of the teaching of the Latter Day of the Law who established the path for attaining Buddhahood. 

This is easy to grasp intellectually but very difficult for me to apply personally. As I live my day today, with all of its ups and downs, I should remember that Nichiren is my model as one by one, our Spring Season clients arrive. 

It takes a couple of hours to get an RV settled in. Our clients are seniors and, for the most part, we find it is easier for us to do the moving in for them rather than guiding them to do it themselves. We drive to their lot, back the RV in, engage in the inevitable “not here, here!” negotiations, make sure the vehicle is balanced and anchored properly, decouple from the truck, pull out the extensions, hook up the lines while making sure everything works, and help them unload outdoor chairs, tables, umbrellas, and grills. 

But our job as hosts is to make sure our clients have the best time ever of their lives. So, we add to the list enjoying coffee or tea and catching up on the news. Modeling after Nichiren in *Establishing the Correct Teachings for the Peace of the Land*, we try to make the arrival experience an [“orchid room” dialogue](https://www.worldtribune.org/2023/our-compassion-can-perfume-the-lives-of-those-around-us/). I believe this type of effort is “the path for attaining Buddhahood” for me and an element of kosen-rufu. 

Sensei’s second point:

>Also, from the perspective of the “Buddhism of the people” hidden in the depths of the Lotus Sutra, it could be said that to read “The Opening of the Eyes” is to base oneself on a profound respect and trust for human beings.

Sorry to some of my Whistleblower friends, this understanding is “hidden in the depths of the Lotus Sutra.” Unlocking it takes effort and growth. Don’t put the cart before the horse. Unlocking it is the “priceless gem” and you don’t get it first and then you practice it. First you practice it and then, as a reward, the gem becomes as clear as daylight.

Moving on, there’s an etymology to the word [client](https://www.etymonline.com/word/client) which goes back to ancient Roman traditions. According to *Century Dictionary*, “The number of a patrician's clients, as of a baron's vassals in the middle ages, was a gage his greatness.” At the RV Park, quality is more important than quantity which is fixed. 

Therefore, our success can be gaged by how happy our clients are in the three months to follow. We design our Autumn and Spring seasons to be like a summer camp for seniors. We have so many activities which help us all live and learn together. 

Our first RV Park Forum will be next week and the presenter, together with my therapist on Zoom, will be *me* talking about HS. This will be one moment of the “Buddhism of the people” hidden in the depths of the Lotus Sutra. It’s me coming out, opening to our friends a topic that is permeated with shame, and trusting that based on “profound respect and trust for human beings,” our conversations reverberate within us and also beyond our conclave. 

Have a great day!

I saw a quote that said something to that effect, and it reminded me of you.

Drowning never really scared me; glad I brought my snorkel.  I just didn't expect things to get *that* out of hand.  I am glad I saw it coming before it got really bad last time. This time, I fully expect this to be a trap, so I am fully prepared.

I don't know what is going on with you, and it is truly sad.

I'd say you are my greatest ""what-if"" but you're not.  Now, I know that sounds mean, but give me a second.  I'd say you are my greatest ""what-if"" but only if I didn't know how you felt.  I do know, felt honored to know, and I told you I'd understand everything. That hasn't changed since communication stopped.

I am just tired of people who cannot communicate directly.  You never wrote me a letter, so I know for a fact that one account mentioning a letter is not you. In the unlikely event it is you, I never received it.  That account is also way too wordy to be you.  The person I remember is a man of few words.  However, if it is you, I do not have enough caffeine in my system to respond, and again, I learned my lesson from previous interactions.

People often do things they don't mean to do when they are in survival mode. I am no exception to that rule.  I forgive you and everyone else, but I am tired.  You can send another letter if this is you.  However, it must be in your handwriting.  I still remember your handwriting to this day, so I will know truth from fiction. However, I won't be waiting for it, so no obligation. Calling would be good, too. You have my number. I am not mad, just tired. I'd be happy to hear from you. The real you, the one who always knows the right thing to say to start a conversation.

I've been trying for years to do a long fast after learning of the benefits. Ive been able to do intermittent fasting (16:8) successfully but then I'd eat things that made all the fasting pointless. I had no self control. I was definitely addicted to sugar and I'd eat all the fatty sugary stuff I wanted to. I'd eat healthy stuff too and made sure I'd hit my protein goal each day but the donuts and snack cakes and candy bars were undoing all the good I was trying to do. I can't pinpoint what changed but I felt something in me shift a few days ago and I felt determination I've never felt before and set my goal for 100 hours. I prepared by eating 5 healthy high protein meals and giving away all the junk food in my apartment, bought some zero calorie electrolyte drinks and teas, and here I am 3 days later feeling great. I had to resist the urge to eat multiple times, and the urges were very strong yesterday. Instead of caving I sat and analyzed that urge. I questioned whether it was actually hunger or if it was my brain craving the dopamine hit from the flavors hitting my taste buds. When I realized it was my brain craving that dopamine hit it made it a lot easier to resist eating something. That discovery alone is life changing and I think it will completely change my relationship with food going forward. 

I've felt fine the entire time, a little low energy yesterday and the day before but nothing really remarkable. I've burned 6 pounds of fat. I've gained insight into my eating habits and broken the sugar addiction. Honestly right now when I think about drinking my coffee with the sweet cream creamer I love it doesn't appeal to me and that is really surprising to me because it was always the highlight of my morning, that first sip of sweet and savory hitting my tongue. 

I share all that to say that even if you've failed multiple times you can do it. I now know I have way more self control than I thought and this is giving me the motivation to tackle quitting vaping cold turkey. If you think you can't do something because you've tried and failed multiple times like me you're wrong. I believe in you, so believe in yourself and you'll find you can do it.

150 g sugar

2 tsp baking powder

1 tsp cinnamon

1 pinch salt

150 ml strong brewed coffee (cooled)

As some background I was married for 14 years and am successful career wise.  I realize it’s very easy to misrepresent yourself in a profile.  I am considering using phrases like “quiet and reserved in social settings” or “enjoys quiet times”.
I was active in online dating before the pandemic and have to admit I had some really bad first coffee dates.",1,1742993390.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

(28M) here. 
Asking about relationship stuff for my friend (he is pretty much a worrywort in a sense, but he doesnt get jealous easily.)
So my Friend (Male) have a best friend (Female).
He is in a relationship with a female for 2 years now. 
The female he dated have a best friend (Male). 
The thing is…they had an argument. Somehow it escalated to their best friend and now they are in like a *break* in their relationship. 
Kinda need opinion on how they should handle. 

How it happen was one day. My Friend went to had a coffee break with his best friend in a cafe. Thats all. Nothing else happened. But the partner saw him with his best friend. Then they had an argument. 
But the thing is they were only having a coffee.
It escalated to a point that the girlfriend told him he shouldnt have a female for best friend. But when my friend said u have a male for best friend. The girlfriend said its different then she stomped off. 

FYI. We know the male best friend & the female best friend. Like we introduce to each other before. But yeah. Whats the opinion?

Please specify if you connect your mental health issues with NAR(causing NAR or being caused by NAR) or not. I think that more data on this topic will be helpful for those who suffer from NAR and doctors. I'm really interested in this topic and seeing how much people are going trough NAR breaks my heart. 
My story with mental health issues and NAR:
I have been told by specialists that I make up NAR in my head because of my mental health which was extremely ignorant and made my conditions worse. NAR and sleep was so bad I had intense S thoughts when I was just 17. Turned out my NAR was caused by stomach acid which was caused by my really bad stress and afrin abuse. Possibly not caring about my diet(I had eating disorder), drinking alcohol and coffee on empty stomach and snorting tabaka also damaged my nose, all of this behavior was caused by my mental health problems. One empathetic and holistic doctor connected it all and helped me get out of this hell by taking care of my damaged nose and stomach. I think that holistic approach is really important especially in problems like NAR. Thank you for reading.",1,1742993260.0,nonallergicrhinitis,2,1.0,False

I have scoliosis beginning at T3 - T10 and curved to about 26 degrees.

I've been given muscle relaxers for the pain which can get severe at least twice a month but I usually just take naproxen or ibuprofen. I was told to do pt which just caused more pain at times to the point that I couldn't move my shoulder or neck. 

I had a ct on my shoulder which only found bursitis. Recently had a steroid injection into my left shoulder bursa and have yet to feel any relief, actually much more pain.

I know my scapulas don't move the same way. l've become a consistent gym goer over the past 2 years but before, I was not active at all. Only moved when I was cleaning my house all day. I felt that my body needed to move which is why I started going to the gym. 

My body isn’t balanced. I have small deformities. I have a crooked jaw with one side is “still growing” and TMJ. I had extra bone on my hips that I needed surgery to shave off. One leg is shorter than the other, my hips and shoulders are slanted. 

I'd really like to balance my body or spine in hopes that all pain will be resolved. The pt I go to seem to solely focus on my shoulder as if my back has nothing to do with it even though you can clearly see that my scapulas don't move the same way. But when I do pt for my back it cause pain for my shoulder. My right scapula is pronounced while the left is not. I feel like my entire body is out of balance. I can't sleep on either side, only on my back. Sitting for too long will cause pain too. 

Some history:

I also want to mention that I’ve also been having gi issues for over 2 years. I lost 20lb in a week, and slowly lost more. Went from 160 to 125. Size 8 to a size 0. 

Colonoscopy didn’t show anything, some redness in ilium but biopsy came back negative for crohns and inflammation. I’m sick more than I am healthy. This year, I’ve had weird reactions to sweating waist trainers, hair dye. I’ve cut out dairy, coffee and gluten since November. Not celiac just intolerant. 

I have congenital hypothyroidism, born without a thyroid, taking 175mcg levothyroxin and I have nexplanon birth control.

My father has stage 4 pancreatic cancer and my mother’s family, well she’s the only one that doesn’t have cancer but has mini strokes every month. 

I just need other opinions in this because I feel defeated with my health. I don’t enjoy life as much anymore and I don’t feel like nothing is moving forward with my doctors. They are constantly dismissive. I’ve had separate opinions as well. 

Any advice on how to slowly fix this would be great.",1,1742992909.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1jkaswq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1jkaswq/i_can_only_make_11_onesided_friends_and_never/,I can only make 1:1 one-sided friends and never groups.,"Whenever I make a friend, it's usually an intense 1:1 friendship where we are like a couple of close girlfriends. I've always longed to have more of a ""group"" and be included.

Over the years (I'm 36f) I have had a few of these 1:1 friendships, and they have always panned out the same way. I have lots of extended friends who aren't as close, and my efforts to band them together never work as I am the peripheral, excluded member of each of their core groups, if they have one. I try and show interest in the groups and bond with the different members individually which seems to go down well but never results in more inclusion. One time I was invited by one member to see them alone as they were in-between doing tourist attractions with the group, but I wasn't invited to go along with them even though I was the one who lived in that city. My 1:1 meetup with this friend was so nice that they decided to let the group know where we were, but as the venue didn't have the capacity for 13 people, I managed to quickly find a space in an underground bar for all of us and it turned into an excellent night. 

Didn't get invited to anything else beyond that though. I listened to all their nice plans and expressed enthusiasm, even said I was was free during one of them and I always wanted to see the same event. It got ignored, I took that hint.

How these friendships usually start is I meet a woman who is reasonably like myself and we hit it off, end up chatting over coffee or a drink and we have good banter. Ends up with texts of silly memes or articles etc. We exchange advice about life events. We are usually very equal but the friend is a bit insecure, and the balance each time has eventually skewed to me helping them in various ways and not the other way around.

When it comes to a special occasion I may invite them to my birthday dinner and bring along other extended friends, hoping for better bonding on a group level. The newer 1:1 friend always comes by themselves and they sometimes add all of the other people on social media. I feel good because it feels like I helped expand someone's social sphere and possibly help create a cool thing. But the dynamic is usually me as the common connection to each invitee, with no sideways connections between them.

These 1:1 friends NEVER do this for me. They may be part of groups but never extend invites to me, or involve me. In fact they seem to gatekeep me out. All while acting a bit entitled to invites from me, so if I do see others without them, they notice and seem bummed to have been ""excluded"". 

I always try and stay positive so I don't comment on how I have been the only person to invite them and champion them with nothing like that coming my way.

These 1:1 friendships deteriorate the same way, with them eventually become pretty bitchy, excluding me more harshly by saying ""no"" to invites on my behalf as people might go ""through"" them to me. I don't flag this up and just take it on the chin, pretending not to be bothered, then they end up saying something really crappy and bullying directly to my face.

The latest example was during a phase of grief where I lost a family member slowly from cancer, my 1:1 friend I know through work said I was so negative and horrible to be around, that even if I try and be positive it looks ""fake"", and that is why people avoid me, and that I am defensive and unapproachable, would never do well in a management role because I am not a people person, and I should try to be more ""people pleasing"".

This shocked me, and careful to not live up to their ""defensive"" accusation, I just took it all and thanked them for their honesty. I was so hurt though because from my POV all I did was try and be an open, good and fun friend. The friend who takes interest in their life, initiates fun and drinks and invites people to the table, even though no one is doing that for me in return? I council and support them through various woes, like collecting them from their therapist as they deal with depression, but the second I show a bit of vulnerability or go through a rough patch, I get completely derided and flat out insulted and bullied.

Note: during my ""downer"" phase, I actually invited them to rooftop bars with work groups multiple times, and showed up to a couple of work events and stayed late through after parties having a blast and networking, while THEY moped around hardly speaking to anyone. But sure, it's ME who is the debbie downer?

Thing is, they must be right because how do I explain all that exclusion? Every birthday goes forgotten, no messages from anyone including immediate family or any of these friendsm But I always, always celebrate and get gifts for others.

If you get this far, thanks for reading my vent.

I'm beginning to focus inwards on family and what's important now, but I just feel a bit of sadness looking back though my teens, 20s and 30s and how I never really found my people.

Now I’m 28, and in a few months, I’m stepping back from brokering to focus 100% on syndication. Might even open my own funding company if I can find someone worth managing it.

Before I go, let me give you the real blueprint. And let’s be honest—success in this industry? It’s fueled by a bump of coke, some Adderall here and there, and a whole lot of coffee. You think the guys pulling $100K+ months are just drinking green juice and meditating? Get real.

Here’s what actually works in MCA:
	1.	Speed > Everything. You’re not competing on rates. You’re competing on who gets the contract signed first. If you aren’t turning apps into offers within a few hours, someone else is getting that deal.
	2.	Merchants are professional liars. “This guy offered me a 1.19.” No, he didn’t. “I have no other positions.” Yeah, sure. They’re testing you. Control the conversation, or they’ll run you in circles.
	3.	Always dangle the bait. You don’t sell what’s real—you sell what gets them to sign. Terms will change anyway. If you’re out here giving honest, realistic offers upfront, you’re feeding your competition.
	4.	Volume over everything. This business is about how many swings you take. If you’re not making at least 300+ dials a day, you’re playing.
	5.	Don’t waste time on “follow-ups.” If they need money, they’ll sign. If they don’t, they’re stalling. Move on.
	6.	Caffeine, stimulants, and pressure. This game isn’t for the slow. You need urgency in your voice, energy on every call, and the ability to grind for 10+ hours without blinking. That’s what separates closers from amateurs.

I’ve seen too many brokers waste time trying to “build relationships” and “stand out with honesty.” Wake up. This is a high-stakes, fast-money game. Play to win, or go home.

I’ll still be around collecting my syndication checks, but my days of chasing merchants are done. If I find the right person to manage a fund, I might start one. Until then, I’ll just keep stacking on the backend.

She is POMI, but I’ve noticed that, in the last few days, she’s slightly changing her perspective on the borg.

An elder who used to be our friend keeps insisting on sending me messages; I just ignore him. Over the past two months, the elder’s wife has been sending messages to my wife. Emotional blackmail—sending photos of her kids, saying we’re missing out on their growth, saying she misses us, and that she wants to have coffee with her... My wife either ignores it or, in the rare times she replies, comes up with flimsy excuses.

Last week, she told me that she’s tired of people pressuring her about this, that she just wants to live her life in peace, and that she’s happy with how things are.

Our families are all extreme PIMI, but they don’t know that we’ve stopped attending meetings... Every day it gets harder to hide, but we’re trying.

Additionally, my wife and I are really close friends; our relationship is great. However, I’m extremely scared to share how I truly feel about the borg (years ago, she joked that if I ever became an apostate, she’d leave me). So, we’re at a point where we simply don’t go to the hall or participate in field service anymore, and we’ve cut off contact with everyone from there... but we don’t talk about this topic.

We still haven’t talked about whether or not we’ll attend the memorial this year, but if we do, I’m planning to say ‘under his eye’ (a phrase from *The Handmaid’s Tale*) as soon as we get in the car after the meeting, just to see her reaction.

I’ve found myself spiraling in thoughts of “Sure, he hurt my feelings, but we had some good times! Maybe we should try again with couples therapy!” I know these thoughts aren’t helpful, but I didn’t know how to stop the spiral. 

*So here’s my silly little tip*: make some posters with reminders of whatever you need to hear and put them around your home. I got a giant roll of paper from IKEA for $4, bought a big marker, and wrote all of my grievances out. I cut them up and made my own motivational posters. It sounds stupid, but having the posters around helps me remember why this break up needed to happen, even when I’m feeling emotional. 

There’s one above the couch that says “If he was a good boyfriend, YOU WOULD KNOW.” A similar one on my closet door, next to the coffee machine, on the bathroom mirrors… There’s posters everywhere! They remind me that everything will be okay and breaking up needed to happen. 

I made lots of different posters. Some are sassy reminders that I’m better off on my own. Some are soft reminders that things will get better.  Some urge me NOT to text him, even if I miss him. 

It was really fun making the posters! It’s kinda exciting to write big and stick these weird posters in random spots. I treated it like a solo date: I played music that pumped me up, I had a drank, I danced and sang along. If nothing else, it was fun to blow off steam and have a distraction. But hopefully having these posters around will help me stay strong while I grieve my relationship. ",2,1742991966.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1jkag6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1jkag6u/walton_and_west_chapter_one/,WALTON AND WEST chapter one,"Roxy stood outside West’s Wonders, hands shoved deep into her jacket pockets, staring at the flaking gold lettering on the window. The shop had been her grandmother’s for as long as she could remember—a cluttered little curiosity shop wedged between a vape store and a café that charged ten quid for a coffee. The kind of place that had survived on loyal customers, tourists with more money than sense, and the stubbornness of the old woman who had run it.And now, it was hers, at least, for one night.
The solicitor had handed her the key along with the will—along with a frankly absurd amount of money—and a request: before she shut the place down for good, she was to retrieve a few items.
She pulled the crumpled envelope from her pocket and reread the list.
An old magic 8-ball
A floral umbrella
A book about herbs
The old pocket knife under the counter

It felt ridiculous, like a scavenger hunt set up by a dead woman.
With a sigh, she pulled out the key and shoved it into the lock.
The door resisted at first before groaning open, sending the familiar scent of the shop wafting out—aged paper, dried flowers, and something faintly metallic. The air inside was thick with dust and time, the silence pressing in as she stepped inside.
Nothing had changed.
The lights flickered on, casting a warm glow over shelves crammed with books, trinkets, and things that were probably just junk but had been labeled with mysterious names to sell better. A glass case near the counter housed old rings and pendants, charms meant to ward off things that probably didn’t exist.
Roxy rolled her shoulders and muttered, “Let’s get this over with.”
She spotted the floral umbrella almost immediately—propped up near the door, its faded fabric covered in tiny pink roses. One down.
She wandered deeper inside, fingers skimming along the spines of dusty tomes, passing shelves labeled in her grandmother’s messy handwriting: Dreamwork, Divination, Charms & Talismans. It was all a bit much. She had never believed in any of it. Her gran had, though. Enough for both of them.
She was reaching for the book on herbs when a movement outside the window caught her eye.
Someone was standing just beyond the glass, peering in.
Roxy’s stomach clenched.
A tall man stood just beyond the window, his sharp features partially obscured by the reflection of the streetlights. He wasn’t a drunk tourist or a passerby taking a casual glance. He was watching.
He stepped closer, and she could make him out better now. Tall, unsettlingly tall, draped in a dark three-piece suit that looked like it had seen better days. Dark hair, a little tousled, like it had been combed once but then forgotten about. His green eyes, set behind rectangular glasses, were sharp—too sharp, like they were seeing too much.
And then, without hesitation, he pulled open the door and stepped inside.
The bell above jingled wildly as he entered, his long coat sweeping behind him.
Roxy narrowed her eyes. “What part of ‘closed’ was unclear?”
The man didn’t answer right away. Instead, he spun on his heel, taking in the shop like a museum exhibit, nodding to himself in quiet approval. Finally, he said, “It’s a shame to see the place go.”
She crossed her arms. “Frequent customer?”
“Somewhat.”
“And you knew my gran?”
He tilted his head. “Gran? Ah. You must be Roxane. And yes, I did know her.”
Roxy stiffened slightly. Not many people used her full name. “She told you my name?” She shook her head. “Scratch that—she spoke of me?”
“Yes, she did,” he said lightly, then sighed. “Rather a lot, frankly. It was a tad bit irritating.”
“Lovely.”
She hesitated, then asked, “Alright then, what did she say?”
He tapped his fingers against a nearby shelf. “Clever. Stubborn. A mouth that gets her into trouble but usually talks her way back out again.” He paused, glancing at her. “And a sore loser at poker.”
Roxy blinked. “Excuse me?”
“She mentioned that you take losing… personally.”
Roxy exhaled sharply. “Yeah, well, some things are a scam.”
“A noble stand against injustice.”
She squinted at him. “You enjoy being annoying, don’t you?”
“It’s a skill.” Then, after a brief pause, he added, “Were you two close?”
Her arms tightened across her chest. “None of your business.”
He lifted his hands in an easy gesture of apology. “Of course. A tactless question. My mistake.”
For a moment, silence. Then he turned toward the door, rocking slightly on his heels.
“Well,” he said, “I’ll leave you to it.”
And with that, he was gone, the bell jingling behind him.
Outside, the man—whose name was Kole Walton—stepped into the quiet alley. He moved unhurried, reaching into his coat pocket and retrieving a cigarette. He rolled it between his fingers before tucking it between his lips and flicking open his lighter, the small flame casting a flickering glow.
Before he could take a drag, his other pocket buzzed.
Not his phone.
He sighed, fishing out the small device, its screen pulsing in erratic flashes of light. He didn’t need to check the numbers to know what it meant.
Something was moving.
He exhaled slowly, cigarette still perched between his lips as he let his eyes drift toward the nearest streetlamp. It flickered, once, twice. A little farther down, another did the same.
He smirked faintly, rolling the cigarette between his fingers. “Evening,” he murmured.
Nothing replied.
And then—the cigarette went out.
Kole sighed and flicked it into the nearest drain. “Right, I get it,” he muttered. “I know it’s bad for me. You always bugged me about it.”
The air shifted—not cold, not warm, just there.
The device in his hand pulsed again.
He resumed walking, the streetlights dimming slightly as he passed beneath them, flickering just enough to show that whatever it was, it was keeping pace.
Then, it changed direction.
The device in his hand buzzed sharply. He didn’t need to look up.
He already knew where it was going.
West’s Wonders sat quiet behind him.
The presence drifted toward it, weightless as a breath.
The streetlamp outside the shop flickered, then went out completely.
Inside, the shop’s lights cut out all at once.
A pause.
Then—
A thud.
And Roxy’s voice, loud and unmistakable—
“Oh, for fuck’s cock!”
Kole raised an eyebrow, faintly impressed by the ferocity of it.
The device in his palm jittered wildly for a few seconds longer before flatlining into eerie, absolute stillness.
He let out a breath, tilting his head slightly. When nothing else followed, his smirk returned.
“I’ll miss you, old girl,” he murmured.
Slipping the device back into his coat, he turned and strolled down the alley like nothing had happened.

I just competed alongside my teammates from KaffeBox, Børge and Tyler, in the official Norwegian Cup Tasters Championship, and while we’d run through the format a couple of times to get familiar with the **8 triangle setup**, we definitely weren’t in full-on training mode this time around.   
  
Still, we learned *a lot, and s*omehow I made it all the way to the final and ended up placing **4th,** which I’m honestly still a little shocked about. I thought I’d share a few takeaways for anyone curious or planning to compete in the future:

**Takeaways:**

* **You need to train with harder sets.** We realized pretty quickly that the practice we had been doing was more or less equivalent to the introducing rounds, so next time, we’ll push ourselves more, using different ratios, mixing two coffees etc.
* **Practice in messy environments.** We have been cupping at the KaffeBox HQ, so in a calm, quiet space, but the competition was ofc full of movement, noise, and general chaos. The second I lost focus in the final, I got my cups wrong. Practicing in more “real-world” conditions is underrated and something I’ll definitely work on.
* **Stay calm and focused.** Easier said than done, but the rounds where I stayed centered and didn’t overthink were the rounds I performed best in. 

It was a super fun experience, and a huge thanks to **SCA Norway and the sponsors** for making it all happen!

I've had this mousepad for a year or two and for some reason it ended up sitting around and developing mold stains. It also has some coffee stains. Do you know if it's possible to remove these? What product can I use?",2,1742991451.0,MousepadReview,11,0.75,False
1jkacou,https://www.reddit.com/r/DailyBreath/comments/1jkacou/is_allergy_season_getting_worse_this_year_lets/,Is Allergy Season Getting Worse This Year? Let's Talk!,"Ever felt like allergy season is turning into a never-ending saga? 🤧 Just when you think you’ve dodged the pollen bullet, bam! It hits you like a freight train! This year, I've been battling sneezes and sniffles like they're my arch-nemesis. 

I recently came across some data suggesting that allergy seasons are, in fact, getting worse! Here’s what I learned:

- **Rising Temperatures:** Warm winters and longer summers mean more time for those pesky pollens to invade.
- **More Rain:** It sounds counterintuitive, but more rain leads to more plants growing—and more pollen to irritate our noses!
- **Climate Change:** It’s not just a buzzword; it’s affecting our air quality and extending pollen seasons.

So what do we do, right? Here are some tips that have helped me:

1. **Check Pollen Reports:** I always keep my eye on local pollen forecasts. Knowledge is power!
2. **Invest in Air Purifiers:** They can really help keep indoor air clean.
3. **Get Rid of Dust Bunnies:** Regular cleaning is essential to avoid those sneaky triggers hiding in your home.

And let’s not forget humor! Sometimes you just have to laugh at how ridiculous it can be—like when you think your morning coffee is your saving grace and then your nose starts running at the first whiff of grass! ☕🤷‍♂️ 

So, my fellow allergy warriors, **how are you handling this allergy season? Any tips or tricks to share?** Let’s band together and conquer our sniffly foes!

I don’t really have any experience romantically and I’m afraid of messing up the basics, like do I hug her when I meet her? Should I try to flirt or just get to know her and talk like I talk with a friend? I’m an anxious person in general so I want to have at least some kind of plan of how the date should go so I can be more comfortable. Hopefully she’s inexperienced too so I get a pass for being a bit awkward lol.",2,1742991335.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False
