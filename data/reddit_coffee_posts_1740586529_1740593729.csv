1iyu3es,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1iyu3es/making_toys_for_little_kids_and_other_small/,"Making toys for little kids, and other small, satisfying projects","With world events as they are, it feels like many recent posts on this sub have been quite heavy. So I thought I'd share a lighthearted little project I feel pretty good about, in case anyone else would like to do the same.

Some years back, I made this play kitchen from wood scraps and offcuts, all of which were cupped, warped, gouged, split, or missing knotholes. I wish I had taken a picture to show how bonfire-ready these scraps looked beforehand - putting them together so only the good parts would show was a real puzzle! It was made entirely with hand tools. The magnetic closure and handle for the ""oven"" were salvaged from a broken piece of storage furniture left in our house by the previous owner. The ""oven"" shelf came as a pair with my father-in-law's toaster oven, but he only used one and gave us the other. The ""sink basin"" is a dog bowl I found in the woods, and the knobs were wheels from a broken toy truck that was my brother's as a child. 

The toys are hand-me-downs, except for the wooden coffee set which was a gift purchased new, and the crochet play foods. I made them from yarn scraps and stuffed them with smaller yarn scraps. While I did not follow any pattern, there are many similar patterns made freely available. In one picture, you can kind of see a ""shopping cart"" I made by attaching a wire storage bin to an outgrown push toy. There is more play food in there - mostly fruits and vegetables. 

My kids love this setup and come up with new ideas for it all the time. Even better - when there is a toy they want but don't have, they will try to make it themselves rather than asking someone to buy it for them. 

Are there any small projects you've done that really align with your values? I would love to hear about them. All these little wins really do add up.",1,1740593606.0,Anticonsumption,1,1.0,False

After a min tho we got to talking and laughing and had a good time. He did keep saying that he was hungry and tried to point out some places but I had to come clean about some dietary restrictions and I wa also 'working from home' on the date because it was last minute. I couldn't get off. He kinda took off after, he was just like bye and let out the door so fast lol 

I messaged him later to say I had a good time and that we should hang out again. He messaged back and agreed. Maybe do lunch and if he gives me some notice I can actually take the day off. He said yes to that but has been pretty low contact.

He did say on the date that Feb is a busy month for him with a ton of birthdays, including his lol should I be worried?",1,1740593571.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False
1iyu2md,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iyu2md,"Tyddyn Llan - Llandrillo, Wales","INTRODUCTION: 

A couple of weeks ago I visited Tyddyn Llan, a quaint fine dining establishment nestled in a smal village in North Wales, with my partner. I can say for certain that this was one of the finest meals I've had in the UK, and I have to apologise in advance for the poor photos, I'm not a great shoot and I was itching to eat during most of the shots. 

FOOD: 

Notably Tyddyn Llan is also a hotel, though they call themselves a ""restaurant with rooms"", which isn't unheard of in the UK countryside. We had arrived the night before, but after dinner service, so our first encounter with the cooking was breakfast. It was technically a 6 course set breakfast menu (though you can take things off if you aren't up for it). I asked the waitress why it's so hearty, and she said it's because a lot of their clients like to go on a hike in nearby Snowdonia, so a big breakfast is in order. I wish I had taken pictures because it was a gorgeous meal - from in-house toast with handmade whipped butter; handmade muffins and oats, locally sourced sausages, eggs (from the chickens of a member of staffs sister) and bacon. I don't normally care for black pudding but I loved the one given to us. Even the coffee was sourced from a local roaster, which isn't common in these sorts of establishments, in my experience. 

Now for what this subreddit is for, the dinner experience. To begin with, we were taken in to the lounges and given the menus for the evening and our canapes. The lounge was beautifully decorated and felt incredibly cozy and welcoming. We were told it was recently completely renovated by the new owners, the Head Chef and his partner and Front of House Manager. 

The canapes were gorgeous and I wish I hadn't forgotten to take a picture because they had this one play on the jammie dodger, made with chicken liver & foie gras parfait, blood orange & campari jelly, and a buckwheat & fennel biscuit that was to die for. There was also a nori and uni bite that was delicious and all ingredients sourced in North Wales. To pair, we had some some of the house cocktails, though they offer a wine flight and by the bottle, we aren't heavy drinkers so held off on that. CANAPES: 9/10

Next we had the bread which was a gorgeous sourdough made with a local stout beer, served with two types of homemade butter. To say that this was my favourite restaurant bread in a while would be an understatement - it was hearty, rustic, and delicious and the mushroom butter was great. BREAD COURSE: 9/10

Following that was a dish of local scallops that was well seasoned, though I don't normally care for scallops, my partner loved it. SCALLOPS: 7.5/10

Afterwards was a dish of braised pork cheeks, orange, and walnuts. I loved the pairing of pork and citrus as I normally find pork dished to be quite bland and the acidity worked great to soften the earthiness of the walnuts. PORK: 8/10

The next dish was quite possibly one of my favourites, it was crab, melon, and beetroot. It was so refreshing I was genuinely shocked. I didn't think thise flavours would work together, but lo and behold, I fell in love with it. To me this dish was almost like eating a summers day on the beach here in the north of England. CRAB: 9.5/10

After that we had a stuffed pasta with potatoes, a cheese sauce, and coffee. This dish was quite hearty and the texture from the coffee dusting worked wonders with the relative softness of the pasta and potatoes. The additional bitterness also helped cut back the richness of the dish as well, which was nice because I normally don't care for very rich meals. PASTA: 8.5/10

Next seafood was a sole with smoke ratte potatos and a cockle dashi sauce. The fish was cooked beautifully and the sauce was divine. My only critique is that I wish the potatos had been softer as I normally prefer them that way (never cared for a roastie). SOLE: 8/10

Next up was the main, where I got the lamb and my partner got the beef and I stole some from her! I've had my fair share of lamb growing up where I did and north Wales is famous for it's lamb, so I knew it would be great. It exceeded my expectations - best lamb I ever ate. LAMB: 10/10

As for the beef, it matched up as a very equal contender with the lamb. The night before we had eaten at Ynshir, about an hour away on the other end of Eryri, and had the wagyu there, and the British Black Beef we had at Tyddyn Llan was every bit as delicious, if not matching in just how buttery soft the wagyu was. BEEF: 9/10

Following this was a taste of local cheese and a citrus tart. This was the only dish I felt was ""okay"". Both components were fine, but I felt it was uninspired visually and gastronomically I can ""see"" the idea, I just felt that it could be rethought because how it was done left a lot to be desired. CHEESE: 5/10

The pre-dessert on the other hand was awesome. A perfect blood orange sorbet and ice with perfect cinammon and sugar doughnuts that cleansed the palate and increased my desire for more sweetness to come. This was better than most FULL desserts I've had at starred restaurants elsewhere. PRE-DESSERT: 10/10

As for dessert, it was also excellent. It was a citrus and vanilla tart. Beautifully executed and oh-so pretty, and my partner was full at this point and skipped hers so I couldn't try the other option which was a chocolate one. Not much else to say: DESSERT: 9/10

There was also petit fours and coffee/tea either at the table or in the lounge if you fancied a post dinner treat, but we opted out as we were quite full at this point. Just on an overall food experience I would say that this was in my top 5-10 experiences in the last year, only being beaten out by Mýse, Hélène Darroze, and L'enclume, and Core by Clare Smyth, afterwards it's a bit cloudy but on a dining level it was comparable to Moor Hall, Lympstone Manor, Ynshir, Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, the Hand & Flowers, and Mana. Overall: 93.5/100.

SERVICE: 
The service was friendly and non-pretentious, and quite professional. It felt like they loved their jobs and wanted to truly get to know you, the only downside being that my waitress was a bit older and had a hand cast on (apparently she had injured her wrist at home), which made me a bit uncomfortable watching - I would have preferred she rest at home, but she said she wanted to be in. Maria and Emily were very nice and welcoming throughout and knew everything on the menu and drinks front and back. Nothing seemed like rote memorisation, and Emily selected some great drinks for our food, including some interesting wines from more exotic locations including local Welsh and Moroccan. Overall: 7/10

LOCATION:
North Wales/ Snowdonia is a genuine contender for the most beautiful place on Earth (albeit rainy). The drive there from Manchester was gorgeous and full of beautiful twisty and turny country and mountain rodes. The property as well is a wonderful listed property that was apparently a hunting lodge in the Duke of Westminsters estate long ago. I'm a republican (British version, not American) so I didn't really care for that tidbit. The lounge and dining spaces have been gorgeously redone and were very inviting to be in, and using them for pre- and post-dinner was a welcome addition to the service. However, our room for the night, whilst comfortable was very dated. Apparently there is a reno atex room that's quite popular, and more renovations are on the way, so that's good news as I would have opted for that instead of the room we had which looked to be inherited from the 80s. Overall: 10/10 for Snowdonia, 8/10 for the building, 7/10 for our room

FINAL THOUGHTS:
On a purely gastronomic level, there are very few restaurants in the UK that are performing at a higher level at this moment, and I've been to quite a few in the UK. Relative to Europe as well, this was one of the best meals I've had in a fine dining context. After 10+ courses, a few bottles of wine, and a perfect breakfast - I felt that the price was more than reasonable and I look forward to going back in the spring or summer, and I am shocked they don't yet have a star. I wouldn't be surprised if this became a destination restaurant sooner rather than later (North Wales as a whole is a very underrated culinary hotspot), it's very, very comparable to Ynshir. 

TOTAL PRICE PER PERSON: £185 for dinner, bed, and breakfast. Alcohol was another £120.

1iytyst,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1iytyst/just_got_back_from_tokyonothing_groundbreaking/,Just got back from Tokyo...nothing groundbreaking but I will share nonetheless,"Quick set up. Family of 4, the kids are teenagers. Second trip to Tokyo in 3 years. Not really traveling on a budget but also not shopping at Louis Vuitton:) In Japan for 9 nights.

Landed in Narita but if Haneda is an option, it's much closer. We scheduled a driver via Klook which was seamless. Last time we took a bus but our airbnb was about 5-7 minutes from the closet station so wanted to make it easy with luggage...last time we stayed in Shibuya at a hotel and the bus basically dropped us off in front. Also, we probably waited for the bus for around an hour last time so wanted to recoup some of that time as the buses are scheduled versus coming every X minutes. Make sure to grab a wifi puck, we used Ninja Wireless (reserved in advance) and the pick up/drop off is super easy and way cheaper than adding data to your plan, at least for us it was.

We found an amazing airbnb in the Ebisu neighborhood, highly recommend if you like eating, shopping and getting lost on walks and finding amazing streets and sounds. The airbnb even had a washer/dryer combo which is super convenient for a family, I wish we packed less. If you find yourself in Ebisu, I recommend dinner at On The Hill, it was closed the entire week we were there and then the last night as we hit the streets to find food, the lights were on and we hopped in. Menu is Japanese only but with translate it was easy to order. Food was actually western leaning and the owners were awesome and great little buzz, felt like a locals spot as everyone seemed to know everyone. If you want amazing scones, muffins and shortbread cookie, you have to check out Cream Pand Bakers. A tiny little walk up window and they open at 730am which was great to also get a coffee as most of the coffee spots open a little later. LOVED this spot. Garden House Crafts is also nearby and they had great breakfast and coffee options and you can sit and chill. As you get lost in Ebisu, make your way down towards Naka-Meguro station, tons of spots to eat...and you can wait in line for some I'm Donut donuts...probably not worth the wait if the line is too long. There is a great coffee spot near the station called Onibus. Coffee and banana bread were solid and they have an upstairs that is level with the trains cruising by. I forget the name but there is a great Sake store on a side street to buy and/or hang out and get a late afternoon/night sake. Walking along the Meguro River was fun, awesome pathway on both sides of the river. It's lined with cherry trees and while we did not get to see them bloom (Feb.) it must be an amazing walk in March/April. There is a really nice Starbucks Roastery along the river, not a big Sbux fan but it hits a little different in Japan and again, if you need an early morning coffee, they will be open and a nice selection of food options. My favorite spot in Ebisu to shop was nanamica, which is North Face purple label, Japan only.

Ebisu is also close to Shibuya for more shopping, easy walk or hop on the Ebisu - Yanamote line, one station or take a couple stations and get to Harajuku or Shinjuku. That whole area is packed with shops and restaurants. Some areas can get busy. We also did a half-day trip out to Shimokitazawa for some thrifting, cool area with awesome small streets and eats. Wanted to get out to the Plum Garden to see if they were in bloom but ran out of time. 

If you are a golfer, find time to checkout The Divot Store. Super small vintage golf store in a back alley. Down the street there is a Ron Herman store/cafe which had great food, also western leaning but had the fluffy pancakes the wife wanted. Not a lot of tourist and we saw lots of Japanese families eating, it felt like it was an outing as they were dressed nice...although the style in Japan is on point, everyone has a great sense of style. You can keep the walk going and end up in Harajuku for more shopping, the wife picked up a vintage designer purse at QOO, probably a 15 minute wait to get into the store. If you are in Harajuku, definitely check out Yoyogi Park and the Meiji Jingu temple...this is an awesome park to stroll.

We took an overnight trip to Hakone for a Ryokan with a private onsen. Took the Romancecar which you can book in advance. Views of Fuji on the way down and back, if the weather cooperates. Walked around Gora for the day, a must stop is Coffee Camp for lunch, great food and drinks. We took the Hakone Ropeway which was fun but get ready for going over all the sulfur:) Get to the top for a great Fuji view. We wanted to get down to the Lake but the Ropeway down was closed and did not want to take a bus, plus wanted to have time at the Ryokan. This was a nice break from the Tokyo buzz.

We kept our airbnb so we did not have to pack everything for a one nighter, which was nice to come back to a home feeling. 

We did a food tour in Shinjuku. It was fun but not amazing. Around $100 per person and while we got tons of food, it was almost too much food but we met some other awesome travelers, all in all it was good but would not do again. We also trained out to Akihabara (Electric Town) and that's a hard pass the next time.

For the last 2 nights we moved to a hotel, The Edition Toranomon, near Azabudai. The Azabudai Hills is a cool/new shopping area but all high-end so nothing too crazy after a walk through of enjoying the lansdscape and buildings, they did a really cool job of creating this space. We loved the hotel, lobby is on 31st floor and overlooks Tokyo Tower, really good sized rooms. However, I booked one room with 2 queen beds, which I thought would be good for us but apparently there is a law where you can get 4 people in a room so we had to book a second room...which the kids loved. Even if you don't stay here, I would recommend going for a breakfast as they have an awesome breakfast set, choose a signature dish and have access to their buffet of fruit, breads, juices, granola, milk, meats, etc. Try to eat along the window with a Tokyo Tower view, we ate along the window which was more lobby area than restaurant, perfect. Took a train ride over to Ginza, which has lots of shopping but definitely more big city vibes...good spot to grab a snack/dessert is Age 3 followed by a Bongen coffee. IMO, no real need to hang in Ginza for more than half a day. We took a train over to Yanaka which is a must. Old town Tokyo with an awesome vibe. We rented bikes from Tokyo Bikes Yanaka and had a blast cruisng around visiting Tennoji Temple, Yanaka cemetery, Yuyake Dandan - Yanaka Ginza (great spot above the stairs for used Kimono's), Tokyo University and all kinds of other side streets. The kids wanted a burger so we ended up at Ghost Burger which was great. This was a notable day for the fam.

The one thing I wish we did was pack some ski gear and rent skis/board. I was not aware that Tokyo is only a 1.5 hour train to snow, I thought you had to fly. This would have been a great day trip.

Trains are like clockwork and super easy to use/navigate. The people are amazing. Tokyo is super clean and safe...no hesitation letting the kids go off on their own to meet up with friends who were also in Tokyo. We loved Ebisu as home base.

Japan is rad, have fun and you will 100% want to comeback.

1iyty9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tnnursery123/comments/1iyty9g/the_art_and_science_of_growing_mushrooms/,The Art and Science of Growing Mushrooms,"Mushroom cultivation is a fascinating process that combines elements of science, agriculture, and culinary arts into a rewarding endeavor. Unlike traditional gardening, growing mushrooms does not rely on photosynthesis and instead involves carefully managing moisture, temperature, light, and nutrients to create an ideal environment for fungal growth. One of the main attractions of cultivating mushrooms is their unique life cycle, which transforms nearly invisible spores into robust, fruiting bodies that can be harvested for food or medicinal purposes. The diversity among mushroom species offers growers an array of choices, from the popular and beginner-friendly oyster and button mushrooms to more exotic varieties like shiitake and lion’s mane.

The first step in mushroom cultivation involves selecting an appropriate species for your experience level and local conditions. Each type of mushroom has its own set of requirements in terms of substrate preference, temperature range, humidity, and light exposure. Oyster mushrooms, for instance, adapt well to different substrates and can be grown on coffee grounds, straw, or even cardboard. Shiitake mushrooms prefer hardwood-based substrates, such as oak or maple logs, which need to be inoculated and then incubated in a moist environment for several months before the fungi begin to fruit. Selecting the right species is crucial because it sets the foundation for a successful yield.

https://preview.redd.it/k5owyq9ywile1.png?width=3936&format=png&auto=webp&s=3215d0662ffb555cf6ff31862bb72deb94c1d260

Once you have chosen your mushroom variety, it is time to prepare the substrate. A substrate is the material that provides nutrients for the mycelium, which is the vegetative part of the fungus. Substrates can range from hardwood sawdust and straw to composted manure or grain. Properly preparing the substrate often involves sterilization or pasteurization to kill off competing molds, bacteria, and insects. This step ensures that your selected mushroom mycelium faces minimal competition during the crucial colonization phase. Sterilization is commonly achieved using a pressure cooker for small-scale grows, while larger operations might use specialized pasteurization equipment.

Inoculation is the process of introducing mushroom spawn, which contains mycelium, into the prepared substrate. The spawn may come in the form of grain, sawdust, or plugs, depending on the mushroom species. During inoculation, you must work in a clean environment to avoid contamination. Mycelium is highly sensitive and, if infected by competing organisms, can result in failed growth. Proper procedures, such as using sanitized tools and wearing gloves, help maintain a sterile setting. After inoculation, the substrate is sealed or placed in containers or bags with filtered air exchange and incubated at temperatures and humidity levels appropriate for the specific mushroom strain.

During incubation, the mycelium spreads throughout the substrate, absorbing nutrients and establishing a robust network of fungal threads. This stage may last anywhere from a couple of weeks to a few months, depending on the species and the conditions provided. Observing a healthy white mycelial growth without traces of discoloration or foul smells indicates successful colonization. When the substrate is fully colonized, it often turns a whitish color, signaling that the next stage is ready to begin.

Fruiting initiation typically involves manipulating temperature, humidity, and light to mimic the mushroom’s natural environment. Many mushrooms require a slight temperature drop and higher fresh air exchange to induce fruiting. Exposing the fully colonized substrate to filtered daylight or indirect light helps the fungus determine that it is time to produce mushroom bodies. Maintaining proper humidity levels is essential; mushroom pins, which are the young sprouts, can dry out quickly if the environment lacks sufficient moisture. Frequent misting or using a humidity tent can help maintain the ideal moisture content.

As the mushrooms grow, they expand rapidly. Regular observation ensures you harvest them at the best stage for flavor, texture, and nutritional value. Some mushrooms, like oyster varieties, are harvested when the edges of the caps begin to flatten, while button mushrooms are typically picked at a smaller size for a firm texture. Clean harvesting practices, including cutting the mushroom at the base rather than pulling, help preserve the substrate for subsequent flushes, as many mushroom varieties can produce multiple harvests from a single inoculation.

Once picked, mushrooms can be used fresh in various dishes, dried for long-term storage, or processed into powders for use in soups, sauces, or supplements. By understanding the intricacies of each stage—species selection, substrate preparation, inoculation, incubation, fruiting, and harvesting—anyone can delve into the art of mushroom cultivation. Though initially it might seem daunting, the process is greatly rewarding, offering a sustainable, nutritious, and often medicinal bounty that underscores the profound connection between nature’s hidden fungal networks and our own food systems.

Cultivating mushrooms expands our appreciation for the complexity of the fungal kingdom. Whether you start with low-tech methods in your home or aspire to larger-scale commercial production, you will find that the attention required to nurture these remarkable organisms not only brings delicious harvests but also fosters a deeper respect for the delicate balances in our environment. In an age focused on sustainable solutions, mushroom cultivation highlights the remarkable potential of fungi to transform waste materials into valuable nutrition while contributing to soil health and ecological diversity.

I've reworked it with your words in mind to the best of my ability and would love to know what you think.

But I'd work hard to promote my book and I do have confidence in my marketing ability though, and it does demonstrate that  I can grab eyeballs.)

Dear \[Agent\]  
\[personalization\]  I believe my 85,511-word novel *Where The Light Gets In* is a good fit for your list. It blends the quirky characters and grief of *Remarkably Bright Creatures* by Shelby van Pelt, the raw examination of challenging relationships of *Adelaide* by Genevieve Wheeler, and the bittersweet humor of *The One Hundred Years of Lenni and Margot,* by Marianne Cronin.

Will Lupo’s future died the day Keira did. Six months after his ex-girlfriend’s suicide, 22-year-old Will finds himself in the driver’s seat of a garbage truck in gritty East New York, picking up trash instead of picking up the pieces of his own life. College was supposed to be the start of something great, but now, he just wants to disappear—one basket pickup at a time. Then he stumbles upon the Brooklyn neighborhood’s last refuge: a rundown community center that shelters the homeless and mentally ill. It’s slated to be bulldozed for a coffee-shop-nightclub, and for the first time in months, Will cares about something again. He knows Keira would have. Determined to help, he pulls together an unlikely team: a rogue psychiatrist, a fame-hungry influencer, neighborhood locals, and the college friends he abandoned after Keira’s death. Together, they take on greedy developers and city politics in a battle for the people no one else sees. But as the demolition deadline looms, so does his reckoning with Keira’s death. If he wants to save the center, he’ll have to confront what he’s been avoiding: the truth inside Keira’s still-sealed suicide note.

As a psychiatrist with a decade of experience in both city hospitals and private practice, I’ve seen firsthand the long shadow cast by the 1970s decision to close asylums. Both my personal and professional lives have been shaped by this reality. My deepest aspiration is to illuminate the challenges of the psychiatric world while humanizing the people within it. I have been published in SheKnows magazine and KevinMD, and my social media content has garnered millions of views across multiple channels.

1iyttot,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1iyttot/coffee_flavour_fades_immediately/,Coffee flavour fades immediately,"
I recently just started grinding my own beans with an Ode gen 2 and brewing with a Moccamaster manual. I’ve bought some medium roast beans from Guatemala city and I’ve fiddled with the grind settings from 6-7.2 on the grinder shifting the flavour from bitter to acidic but in all of these tests, the coffee still ends up with a brief flash of flavour followed by a watery aftertaste. I’m using 1:15 as my ratio for coffee to water and I’m also closing the filter on my moccamaster initially so that all the grinds get soaked and can bloom for half a minute before I put it in a half drip. Is it any issue that I’m only doing a small batch of 20grams at a time to experiment? 

The beans were roasted less than 10 days ago and were harvested from june 2023 but I’ve bought it from the shop where I’ve had this coffee and it’s tasted really nice then. Does anyone know what I’m doing wrong or should try tinkering with?",1,1740592946.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

Aren't their doctors suggesting going caffiene free? They should. Prescribing someone anti-anxiety medication when you know they are abusing caffiene seems dangerous to me. Almost like a prescribed speedball.

1iytr86,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iytr86,Carter Move Smell Is Easily Fixable and Not an Issue,"
As someone who was hesitant to buy one after seeing countless bad odor reviews (even here on Reddit), I wanted to share my experience for anyone considering a Carter but feeling put off by the negativity. TL;DR: It’s the best travel mug I’ve owned. The smell issue is real at first, but it’s easily fixable.

There are tons of comments about Carter mugs having a porous ceramic lining that supposedly absorbs liquid and later starts emitting a nasty, persistent smell—one that won’t go away no matter how carefully you use the mug. Washing it immediately, drying it with the lid off… nothing helps, they say. Naturally, this raises concerns about its safety. And you’ll find these complaints everywhere, including Fellow’s own review section.

Still, I decided to take the risk and buy one. And to my dismay, after my very first cup of coffee (and an immediate hand wash), that infamous weird smell appeared. Since I bought it from a local distributor with a no-return policy, the usual ""just return it to Fellow"" option wasn’t on the table.

Here’s what helped (though honestly, the smell can probably fade on its own after a week or two of regular use):

Gently scrubbing the inside with a soft toothbrush and baking soda paste
Repeatedly rinsing with hot water, soap, and more baking soda, shaking the mixture with the lid closed
Letting it sit overnight in the same solution

It seems the issue comes from some residual manufacturing compounds that get released after the first use. After a couple of days of deep cleaning, the smell was completely gone—now it just lightly smells like coffee. That said, you should definitely keep it clean after every use and wipe it dry each time (including detaching the gasket and drying it with a towel). To reiterate, the smell issue is definitely there at first, but it goes away with some semi-thorough cleaning. I’m not sure why so many people struggle to get rid of it and are so quick to give up on the mug instead.

TBH, I think Fellow should address the issue more clearly instead of gaslighting customers by saying it's their fault for keeping the lid on too long (it's definitely not) and burying odor-removal tutorials as deep as possible. Just admit that some mugs don’t go through the necessary cleaning process and let everyone know the smell goes away. People would be a lot less frustrated.

All the good stuff that's been said in all the video reviews about the mug is there. Heat retention is incredible—even without the lid ( but with splash guard installed), it holds heat surprisingly well. It doesn’t leak and doesn’t alter the taste of the coffee, and the open-lid design really lets you enjoy the aroma while drinking. I also love the slightly rough texture of the exterior, it's quite grippy. BTW, I store mine with the lid on but not fully tightened and haven’t had any new smell issues so far.
Been using it daily for two weeks in -5 to -10°C weather without a single issue, and I really don't see it falling apart or the paint/""ceramic"" flaking off anytime soon. My little OCD soul is happy.

Fun fact: The Carter Move 12oz fits snugly in the 1Zpresso K-Ultra case if you have one—just in case you want to throw it around for some reason.

1iytpps,https://www.reddit.com/r/HipImpingement/comments/1iytpps/1_week_postop_today/,1 week post-op today,"48F. One week ago today I had a full labral reconstruction (13 anchors), acetabuloplasty, femoroplasty, and capsular plication. I was prepared for the worst. Here’s how it went: woke up from surgery trembling out of control, but was re-assured it was due to the anesthesia and it would go away soon, which it did. The nurse asked my pain level and it was around 4-5 but mostly just post-surgical trauma types of stuff, and I opted to try only Extra Strength Tylenol instead of narcotics because I was afraid of constipation and not being clear headed. As it turned out, I never needed anything more than this. The Tylenol every 4-6 hours kept pain below a 5. My doc wanted me to stay overnight, which I did. The first time I got up to use the bathroom I got lightheaded and had to sit back down and have help from the nurse. After that, I was pretty much able to do it all myself, but I did have my mother beside me just in case. By the next morning, my leg had gone from 100% dead weight to me being able to maneuver it to get out of bed, in the car, etc. 2-3 days post-op I was able to shower on a stool and get around on crutches fine and get dressed with the help of a grabber. The main issue was puffiness all over. I drank coffee in the morning and herbal tea made of dandelion/nettle/lemon balm/cleavers/mint and switched from Tylenol to Aleve on day 4 and 80% of the swelling went down the next morning. Never had any nausea or constipation and was so thankful. Went to PT and post-op appointment on day 6, all went well. Went out to eat afterwards, then walked through Trader Joe’s on crutches. I know I’ve still got a long way to go—I am hoping to get back to trail running, triathlon, and mountaineering—but I just want to encourage you guys who may be about to go through this surgery. I know people have all different experiences, but so far mine has been much better than I ever imagined. 

Some of the things that helped me the most were: 
- prehab: I worked really hard to gain strength and more flexibility for several months before the surgery. Strength training, stretching, Pilates.
- ice machine: you need this!!! So much easier and more effective than ice packs. I got one that was $219 on Amazon.
- grabber: this can’t be underestimated. It helps you pull your underwear up, you can pick stuff up when you drop it, etc. You need one. 
- was able to manage without narcotics. This is not a popular move, but I think staying clear headed and focused, able to meditate, do breathwork and visualization, and avoid nausea and constipation allowed my body to work on what it needed to in those first days
- wedge pillow for sleeping helped at night
- good help: I had lots of family to help and allowed me time to relax and focus on healing. Read a lot, watched good movies, made the most of it. Stayed positive.

I am looking ahead to staying patient and consistent for however long it takes, which I know will be longer than I’d prefer, but it is what it is. Sending all of you love, healing energies, and all the best luck out there! Thanks to those who helped ease my mind and answered questions and gave me frank answers 🙏🏻🩷✨

What ways have you seen your co workers get these items?","Been with the company a couple weeks. I thought it was surprising that they say the highest numbers of shrink/ damaged / stolen product comes from employees. 

My store has a small team, there’s 5 of us. We are all down to earth, our manager recently left but would allow us to buy items at the store/ secure items behind the counter if we knew there was a sale coming up/ and it was something we wanted. 

 Random example, a damaged out rug that was found in the back when they were cleaning stuff up. I had no interest but my co worker wanted it, she said she never feels comfortable taking anything even tho it’s “damaged out” and my sm said she could have it, she mentioned she always wants to pay something for compliance, so I rang her up for the rug being $1.

My SM at the time recommended if there’s stuff we want from penny days, not to ring it up all at once, many of my co workers but drinks or food for lunch, and that’s when we will ring up one of the penny items behind the counter that they wanted, 

Instead of ringing up 5pennies all at once and  they only owe 5cents. I agree, that looks a little more sus in my eyes then ringing one penny up with a $1 or $2 transaction. 

How do you guys handle these transactions and how do your employees get damages.

I read from others that once it’s damaged out/ expired and gets processed through the HHT. If it goes out the back door into the dumpster it’s fair game to trip and stumble the stuff into your trunk. 

Appreciate any advice, our store doesn’t have to big an issue with theft of expired / damaged products (our shrink numbers are low). We have just started attacks by the sky shelves though. I was in charge of re organizing the coffee shelves and my temporary sm let me take a whole bag of day old expired coffee, I drink a cup just about every morning, and it’s the same coffee I buy at the grocery, so I straight asked if I could have it? Walked right out the front door with it, Is this right or should I just be throwing it in the dumpster with everything else and getting it later? 

Appreciate everyone’s expertise, This is all for science of course

I had a Nissen fundoplication 15 years ago and it worked great for about 7-8 years before I started having symptoms again. I’m back on heavy doses of PPIs morning and night, AND I often use Gaviscon or Reflux Gourmet on top of that just to get some freaking sleep. I stopped drinking coffee and use a wedge pillow as well. 

They did all the testing (endoscopy, barium swallow, manometry, etc.) and confirmed they’re seeing reflux and a hiatal hernia again. They biopsied my esophagus and found some cellular changes but it was not at the point of Barrett’s (yet). 

Now they want to see if they can repair my wrap. I’m hesitant because my first fundoplication had to be converted to open and was a very painful and lengthy recovery. Just feeling lost and unsure what to do. Would love to hear about your experiences. ",2,1740592601.0,GERD,1,1.0,False

1iyto9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iyto9s/beginner_espresso_machine_and_set_up_budget_350/,Beginner espresso machine and set up [budget $350 and under],"Ive been lurking for a while and I've generally developed the question on if there is a specific criteria for finding a good espresso machine or accessories. Im currently looking at the Breville Bambino and the Casabrews compact machine, but I know there are a lot of espresso machines that are good out there. I am looking for any reccomendations on espresso based on what im looking for from anyone else with similar needs or desires from their espresso machine.  
- I don't serve large crowds, usually it's just me and my roommate we may have 2-4 drinks a day depending on the day  usually on the weekends otherwise its just 2 a day. The types of drinks we drink range from Americanos to Lattes, just straight Espresso etc. 
-  Counterspace is kind of a deal for us as our kitchen is on the smaller side and we have a lot of unorganized use of it taking up space which we are working on. (I'm willing to make room for a good espresso machine tho, just probably not looking for one of those really big ones) 
- I will be mainly using it for the espresso itself. Im going to by buying a milk steamer/ frother because I drink a lot of steamed milk and the upkeep for our current espresso machines steam wand is something i don't want to keep up with (we have a mr coffee espresso machine. It works for my roommates needs as they  just wants to be able to pull 4 shots at a time, but the espresso quality is seriously lacking and every time I steam milk it requires i run a cucle of just steaming water. Could be normal, this is my first espresso machine. I dont mind using the steam wand specifically for latte art) 
- experience level is beginner for pulling my own shots. I have worked in coffee shops before, just usually they already have a set standard for equipment due to functionality so this time it's just me on my own looking for a good and reliable home set up. I prefer a manual grinder and an espresso machine that isn't too hand operated. Maybe some controls here and there im open to but overall not wanting hand operated. 
- upkeep and how long the machine lasts is also a factor for me. Im looking got an investment, so something reliable that doesn't have a lot of issues. I would like at least 5-8 years out of this machine, i have no idea if that's asking a lot yet 😂
- Budget and Location, I live in the US and im looking for an espresso machine that is something under $350 ish, anything above that may be a little bit of a stretch for me as i also am in need of accessories.  I will be getting a hand grinder likely one with a ceramic burr to start off with. The accessories im considering are: puck screen, WDT tool, different types of portafilter including bottomless. 
Which brings me to the question, how are these accessories decided upon or needed? Are there certain machines that generally need certain accessories or is it up to the person and their needs? 
Personally I'm looking more for an elevated espresso experience that I can rely on, I'm not too specific at the moment. For instance, a lot of the beans I have are the Starbucks brand that I keep in my freezer (i know I shouldn't i just have a bunch of them and I only bring them out for a drink) i may buy more freshly roasted ones for the experience and espresso quality later on. 


So given that information, does anyone have any reccomendations on machines and or accessories? Thank you so much for reading all of that and responding if you do. Im looking forward to being more of a part of this community and sharing some good espresso! ",1,1740592583.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1iytnb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1iytnb9/explora_i_review_great_cruise_with_major_gaps/,Explora I Review - Great Cruise with Major Gaps,"I’ve really been enjoying reading and getting helpful info out of this subreddit, so thought I’d contribute with a review of our most recent cruise last week on Explora I. 

For background, we’re a married couple in our early 50s with no kids who love to spend our money (and points) on travel. We cruise as frequently as our full time jobs allow, most often on Seabourn, but we’ve also sailed with Norwegian, Royal Caribbean, Regent, Azamara, and SeaDream. This was our first Explora cruise and while we had a fantastic time, there were also some real misses.

- **Ship:** Explora I (MSC)
- **Dates:** 2/14/25 - 2/21/25
- **Itinerary:** Western Caribbean, rt Miami going to Belize, Costa Maya, Cozumel & Key West with 2 days at sea

### The Good

- Explora I is without a doubt the best-designed cruise ship we’ve been on. It was at high capacity, but never felt crowded with plenty of comfortable spaces to relax and grab a snack or drink. 
- The food was the best we’ve ever had on a cruise, the wine and coffee selections were excellent, and the cocktail program was genuinely impressive for an all-inclusive cruise. 
- I even went in the pool multiple times across multiple days, which I rarely do on cruise ships with their typically tiny crowded cruises. 

### The Big Question: Would We Sail Explora Again?

- Only if the price was right. Currently, Explora’s pricing is only a little less than Seabourn and SeaDream, and if that remains the case, we’re okay paying the small premium for the polish the others have. Explora is definitely an attempt at a luxury experience, but the company doesn’t yet seem to understand luxury customers or expectations, and that’s reflected in the details.

### The Nitty Gritty Details

### Embarkation: Messy

- All guests had the same embarcation time, which didn’t make sense when premium cabins boarded first.
- We were told to wait in some chairs where we got to watch everyone else check in for an hour before being allowed to check in ourselves. Why not just have us show up later?

### Base Level Cabin: Almost Perfect

- The room layout was smart with really nice touches like a Dyson hair dryer including the diffuser attachments, a hot water kettle as well as an illy coffee maker, a nice bookshelf with books that we were actually interested in reading, and a couch out on the balcony that I really enjoyed spending time on.
- Negatives, really not many. There is a smoke detector in the closet, directly outside the shower and behind the vanity. I set off the fire alarm twice—once using a flatiron, another time from steam after a shower. I have never done that on a ship before (oops).
- There is no actual power socket next to one side of the bed, but there is a regular USB & USBC port, so I was able to make do.
- Mini fridge was never restocked.

### Dining & Drinks

- **Reservations:** We weren’t able to book in advance (the website wouldn’t work, and the app only functions on ship WiFi), so we connected to the wifi and did that while waiting to board.
- The kitchen was clearly overwhelmed our first night in Med Yacht Club. Two dishes had to be sent back because they were cold, and dinner took over 2 hours. We had better experiences there on subsequent nights.
- **Drink service:** If you’re sitting anywhere—inside or outside—you’ll have to flag someone down for a drink (which will take some time to arrive) or walk to the bar yourself. 
- **Lobby Bar:** Service was faster here, but my Old Fashioned would still always arrive watery because they didn’t have proper ice (only the Malt Whisky Bar had large-format ice, which affected drink quality ship-wide).
- **Marketplace Buffet:** The food was great, but the setup meant waiting at multiple stations to assemble a meal. You wouldn’t actually eat with the people you sat down with. We stopped going altogether.
- **Afternoon dining options:** Once Marketplace closed at 2:30, the only food available was snacks from the coffee bar. That’s a huge oversight for guests returning from excursions.
- **Crepe & Ice Cream Stand, Coffee Bar:** Both closed early, and the crepes were pre-made and reheated (resulting in a tough, bready texture). An outdoor ice cream stand or coffee/tea option after dinner would be great.

### Excursions & Ports

- **Snorkeling in Belize:** Fun, but the boat was overcrowded—every available inch was packed. Luxury lines wouldn’t allow this.
- **Wildlife treatment:** The provider chummed the water and manhandled the stingrays and sharks, which I personally dislike. 
- **Port selection:** One of the advantages of smaller luxury ships is visiting better ports, often with alongside docking. 
- **Port talks:** The presentations were informative about the country’s history, but they lacked practical details like maps, currency, taxis, tenders, or suggestions for independent exploration.
- **Pier logistics:** Since the ship shares ports with mega-ships, the walk from the dock to land was long, with no assistance from Explora (except in Cozumel, where they allowed third-party vendors to charge for transport). The duty free shopping malls that have to be navigated to even leave the port areas are ridiculous.

### Other Odd Choices

- **Outdoor seating:** There’s very little shaded seating outside, and those spots were all gone before we were even awake. We spent way more time indoors than we would have liked, and far too many venues are entirely indoors without views outside.
- **Socializing**: I’m the introverted nerd, but my husband loves the social aspects of cruising and getting to know people from around the globe. On the positive - the ship was maybe 1/3 American and 2/3 European, which we enjoy. But very few spaces seemed to encourage socialization, with the result being that we didn’t get to know as many people as we usually do on a cruise.
- **Next Cruise Program:** You can book a specific cruise onboard for a 5% discount. That’s underwhelming compared to other lines, and a huge portion of their upcoming schedule is dependent on new ship deliveries. We might have booked a certificate if the discount was larger and more ships were already in operation.


### Service: The Big Letdown

- The crew wasn’t rude, but they weren’t personable either. Very transactional.
- We usually tip generously and get to know staff, but there were multiple days where I didn’t tip anyone because I was going up to the bar or buffet and serving myself most of the time.
- Staff frequently walked past empty glasses, dirty dishes, or guests sitting with nothing in front of them without stopping.

### Final Thoughts

- Explora I is a beautiful ship with fantastic food and drink, but the service and experience don’t yet match the price point. If rates remain comparable to Seabourn or SeaDream, we’ll stick with those for a truly luxury experience. However, if Explora refines its service and lowers its prices slightly, we’d absolutely consider sailing with them again.",1,1740592514.0,chubbytravel,1,1.0,False
1iytmrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/jiujitsu/comments/1iytmrf/how_an_abusive_relationship_with_jacob_couch/,How an abusive relationship with Jacob Couch almost ruined my life,"Hi. For those of you who don’t know me on here, my name is Emma Bruntil. I’m a wrestler for Team USA. I’m a 2x NCAA Champion, 2x US Open Champion, and a senior world team member. I’m a BJJ blue belt, and teach a lot of awesome people in the BJJ community how to wrestle. I thought and sat on this post for a really, really long time. Almost a year, to be exact. I’ve wrote and re-wrote it dozen times, unsure how to translate into words exactly how difficult of an experience this has all been for me. In the beginning, after breaking up with my then Fianceè, Jacob Couch, I was too traumatized and confused to really make sense of what had exactly happened. By the time we broke up, on May 1st of 2024, I was cut off from virtually everyone. Even my parents didn’t know that I was in an abusive relationship. 

Let’s rewind to the fall of 2021. At the time, I was in an extremely toxic environment. My coach, upon finding out that I had herniated my c5-6 disk only 1 year post neck surgery, told me in no plainer terms that unless I could compete, I would not be coached anymore. Meanwhile, my arm would be so numb after practices due to my neck injury, it felt like it wasn’t attached to my body anymore. I was scared for my health. 

It was then, that I originally started talking to my ex via Instagram. I went down to PSF, about an hours drive from McKendree, and started training there when I had the free time. At the time, it was exactly what I needed. It was a positive environment where people valued and believed in me. Due to me moving back to the Olympic Training Center, as well as other reasons that aren’t my business to share, my ex and I went our separate ways.

In March of 2023, my ex and I reconnected when I came out to PSF to run a wrestling camp. We started dating in April of 2023. At the time, I was just beginning my battle with the migraines and neck issues that plagued me all of 2023. Basically, I had a continuous migraine that lasted for 10 months, and was excruciatingly painful. If I wasn’t training, I was alone in my pitch black room, tying to make the best of my less than ideal situation.

In the beginning, there were warning signs with Jacob’s He was extremely controlling. He didn’t want me going out, using Snapchat, dressing in certain ways, wearing make up, or posting certain things on my social media. Due to the fact I was having debilitating migraines around the clock, I saw these things as non-issues. I didn’t do any of those things anyways because I was in so much pain.

However, we were in a long distance relationship. I didn’t see a lot of his day to day activities, and he didn’t see much of mine. At the time, I had just made the senior world team, and was juggling school, 10-15 medical appointments a week just to be functional, and hours a day of training. As things in our relationship started to escalate, their were a lot of things I complied with simply because I didn’t have the time in the day to deal with another fight over what I was wearing to my lift or which friend I wanted to get coffee with. I was simply in too much pain with my headaches and too tired from the stress of it all. 

Leading into worlds, there were certain scenarios that became quite serious. The night after Final X, my ex and I were staying at a friend’s house before we were set to fly to Boston to film a BJJ Fanatics video. At 2am, he woke me up yelling and throwing pillows because some of my guy friends and training partners had texted me to congratulate me on making the world team. He made me block all of their numbers immediately after. I almost broke up with him, but then we had to get on a flight the next day and put on a smile for the cameras. 

Every time he would do something crazy like that, to the point where I was about to end the relationship, he would be so remorseful and nice to me. He’d buy me an expensive flight to go to one of his seminars with him to break up the long distance, or he’d become the most loving, caring partner in the world. It was all so confusing. Especially considering Jacob’s reputation in the BJJ world. He’s known as the “people’s champ” and the “nicest guy in BJJ”. And he would be that guy— sometimes. Other times, it was like a switch was flipped, and then all hell would break loose. I never knew which version of him I was going to get, the version of him who insisted on opening my doors and calling me “sweetheart”, or the guy that would wake me up at 2am screaming.

After the world championships, I was finally able to get the neck surgery I so desperately needed. It was also then when the isolation truly began to set in. Any friends of mine that were independent, or if they didn’t like Jacob, were deemed a threat by him. I was told I’d be disrespecting him if I hung out with them. Being that he had my location and he checked it 20 times a day, if I wanted to go see a friend that he didn’t like, I would have had to leave my phone at home and lie about my whereabouts. I don’t like to lie. It goes against everything I believe in. So I pulled away from my friends, until the only people I talked to were my brother, my parents, and my then financè.

Once he could tell I was fully isolated, and therefore fully invested in the relationship, things started to change. The love bombing and nice spells became shorter. He didn’t need to apologize for his behavior anymore, once he could sense that I wouldn’t leave him. After ADCC West Coast Trials, he went out with his friends to a night club on the Vegas strip. I wouldn’t have cared, except for the fact I hadn’t been able to so much as see most of my friends for months. He had expressly forbid me from going out our entire relationship, only to do that exact thing himself. I told him that I didn’t want to live by his rules anymore. I started to fight back against them. And that’s when shit started to get truly crazy. 

To keep me under his control, he started using threats. He told me he’d get on a plane and find me if I ever cheated on him. He told me he’d kill me. He started repeating these threats multiple times per week.  When I confronted him about it, he said maybe he wouldn’t kill me, but that he’d get on a plane, convince my parents everything was okay, fly to my home state, and stab my childhood dog. Or he would say that I was criticizing him to the point where he’d kill himself. 

He started demanding that I send him anything I was going to post on social media before I posted it. He told me that I wasn’t “submissive enough” to him, and I needed to respect the fact that he had the final say on what I could wear or the things I could do. Ironically, while all this was going on, he later admitted he had been going to a Thai massage parlor and getting h*nd j*bs our entire relationship. 

The more he felt his control of me slipping, the crazier and more escalated he was willing to become. Even to the point of bursting in the room and yelling with his finger in my face when I was hanging out with one of my friends, all because he thought that individual was bisexual. Slowly, almost every aspect of my life was under his control. It was incredibly scary.

When Olympic trials was going on, I was heavily concussed and couldn’t compete. Depressed, I retreated to the mountains, where there was no cell service. For a few days, I was actually happy. I sent him a video on the summit of my 28th Colorado 14’er. Once I got back into service, he called me, extremely angry, because I had agreed to run a wrestling practice without his permission. When I started crying, he said that I was never happy enough for him. He said I needed to stop acting so sad all the time. This cycle continued for about 2 weeks, which he later admitted was a punishment for a medical decision I had made. 

After that, I tried not to get upset as much in front of him. I was too scared I would set him off. But every night after hanging up the phone, I would cry myself to sleep, wondering how I had gotten so deep into such a mess.

Finally, on a trip to Mount Vernon to visit him, We broke up. He woke me up one morning by kicking the pillows again, and I knew he was angry. I walked out into the living room, to him telling me “youre done”, with the crazy look in his eyes that I had began to associate with pure insanity. I knew I hadn’t done anything wrong, but I realized at that moment that it didn’t matter if I had. It was all about if he thought I had done something wrong. When I saw that look in his eyes, I knew that no amount of reasoning with him would help. He was a 210 pound BJJ black belt that had been telling me for weeks that he would kill me. And here we were. In that moment, I shut down. When he was yelling, I told myself I would do or say whatever it took to make it out of there in one piece. Luckily, I did manage to do that.

Over the summer, I visited PSF. Heath had called me after the break up, and supported me still training at PSF. I truly thank him for that. I didn’t want to let one person ruin my plan of switching to BJJ eventually, or keep me from seeing the people that had become family to me. 

Unfortunately, things with Jacob were still crazy. While I was there, he began to keep tabs on me, accusing me and other male members of the team of being together if we both missed a practice at the same time (I was training wrestling over an hour away during certain practice times). He showed up at the gym when I was drilling with a male teammate. He had the crazy look in his eyes, and said that he had shoved a 13 year old kids face into the floor out of anger, and had to come to the gym and so that he wouldn’t snap the kids neck. But I knew that he had showed up to keep tabs on me, and had said what he said just to intimidate me. He later admitted to me that was indeed the case.

When we went to seminars as a team, he said followed me all around the air bnb’s we stayed at, and would get angry if I talked to any male teammates. I was the only girl on those trips. At a few of the seminars, other teammates of mine slept on the floor so that I wouldn’t have to share a bed with anyone and risk setting him off. During that time, we had been broken up for over 3 months and all of this felt like pure insanity. But he was competing at ADCC the following week, and I didn’t want to do anything provoke him before such a big competition. 

In October, I decided to move to PSF full-time, just to have some time away from the wrestling world & take care of my health. I knew I needed friends, and a community, and between PSF and coaching at McKendree, I knew I would have that. I’m sure some people might be confused as to why I decided to move to PSF despite the situation with my ex. I get it. But to me, I spent 2.5 years of my life at McKendree building a community for myself. And another 3 years after that visiting and training at PSF. Before and after my ex, it was always my plan to train at PSF eventually. I was walking the fine line of not wanting to get hurt, but also not wanting to let him stop me from living life on my terms. Maybe that decision makes me look stupid, or naive at the very least. To me, I was just doing what I thought was right at the time. 

Regardless of intention, I definitely wasn’t sure how things would go when I moved. My therapist recommended I get a specific type of restraining order that would prevent him from stalking me, but Fortunately for me, he left me alone. Truthfully, though, I was constantly on edge, worrying that if his (now) partner were to break up with him, that he would start keeping tabs on me again. 

It’s easy to see a person in an abusive relationship and think “why don’t they just leave?” I know I used to. It wasn’t until Jacob and I broke up and I read the book “Why Does He Do That” that I began to truly understand the way abusers minds work. I felt ashamed that I hadn’t even realized I was in an abusive relationship until almost a year into it. After all, wasn’t I the least likely demographic to suffer from abuse? I’m a wrestler. I’ve been taught how to defend myself, to stand up for myself, and to be confident in my decisions. But the thing is— abusive relationships don’t care if you’re an athlete in combat sports or not. They don’t discriminate, and they can happen to anyone.

During the time I was in a relationship with Jacob, it felt like he had slowly chipped away at all the things I valued, until I didn’t even know who i was anymore. Towards the end of our relationship, I remember telling him that I didn’t even recognize my reflection in the mirror. I was a complete stranger, even to myself. It was the most lonely feeling in the world. 

I’m sure some people might read this and think “Okay, why are you sharing this? Why now?”. Maybe they think I’m lying, or that I’m trying to bring attention to myself. For a long time I was certain I wouldn’t share my story, because in my mind it seemed like it was such a lose-lose scenario. If people thought I was a liar, I would just be labeled as the girl who tried to ruin the “nicest guy in BJJ’s life”. If they believed me, then I had to admit that all of those things did actually happen to me, which I was already deeply ashamed about.

Ultimately, I decided to share this, almost a year later, because I don’t want other women to fall into the same trap that I did, especially not with that individual. I am a lot of things— a wrestler, an athlete, a daughter, a friend, but at the forefront of all of those things, I’m a woman. And I care about other women’s safety and happiness. 

Also, I have always believed that the truth will set you free. I blamed myself for a long time for “allowing” all the abuse to happen. I felt like an enormous failure. There would also be times when I was just in complete denial of the entire experience. It felt like my brain had blocked out so many of the traumatic memories, that I would find myself questioning what was even real anymore. “Was it really that bad?” I would ask myself. He didn’t beat me. He didn’t strangle me. I’m still here, after all. 

My therapist, who I am so very grateful for, helped me unpack all of those beliefs. She told me that death threats technically are physical abuse, as well as criminal threats. Most importantly, she told me I would never truly heal until I actually accepted what had happened. As much as I might wish I never went through an abusive relationship— I did. While I don’t have physical scars, the psychological ones took away everything that made me who I am. 

Lastly— I’m so grateful to have such amazing friends and family. They have supported me wholeheartedly throughout the entire process of rebuilding myself. I love them more than I can even say. 

If you’re still here reading this— I want to extend that thank you to you as well. Thank you for letting me share my story and experiences, no matter how difficult it was to write all of this. Thank you for allowing me to share my truth.

1iytjys,https://www.reddit.com/r/AO3/comments/1iytjys/is_my_fic_slow_burn/,Is my fic slow burn?,"Debating whether to tag it or not, each chapter is ab 7k words

Chapter 1: mostly intro of main character, then they meet love interest at a work event. Love interest asks for their number and if they wanna get coffee sometime. MC doesn’t deny them and gives them their # but is kinda sarcastic in a way that says “yeah but as friends”

Chapter 2: 2 months later but is paced over a few days. Love interest is an aspiring photographer so asks MC if they’d ‘model’ for them. MC is like “I guess” and starts to do subtle things like dressing nicer, wearing makeup, etc because LI comments on it and says they look nice. In this chapter near the end LI tries to kiss MC who stops them and is like “no but we can be friends” basically

Chapter 3: 3 weeks later. MC’s brother visits, not a lot of interaction between MC and LI in this chapter except recalling events where they enjoyed being around them since they met months ago and then briefly hanging out with MC and the brother. MC’s brother says they think LI would be a great partner but MC says they turned them down bc they have a habit of not dating those who are actually good for them. 

Chapter 4: 2 months later. MC recalling how they felt safe with LI the night before after they both got drunk at a bar bc MC has a past of being taken advantage of. Awkward scene where MC won’t let go of LI who’s just trying to help them get into bed bc MC wants them to lay down next to them- MC doesn’t know why they just want them to. MC doesn’t really understand their feelings but after that night it’s like whatever romantic feelings they had been suppressing had bubbled to the surface and they can’t push them back down. Next morning LI leaves while MC is in the shower, comes over later to hang out. They end up having their first kiss bc theyre both idiots and are trying to race to the kitchen for something and crash into each other- then they kiss after just staring at the other for a long moment bc they’re rly close. MC is hesitant about dating bc their past of bad exes but agrees when LI asks.

Chapter 5: months later, like at least 4. They say I love you to each other bc LI gets MC their fave snack since they’ve been depressed lately. MC is like “awe, you love me” in a silly way and LI says “Yeah, I do love you”. Some mild making out scenes in this chapter. 

This is all that’s posted but idk whether to tag slow burn bc looking at it chapter wise they get together quickly but time wise it takes a few months. There’s other stuff in the chapters I just left in the relevant relationship stuff. Debating if I wanna make MC asexual or not bc rn they’re just written as sex repulsed from past trauma. If they’re not asexual then they still prob wouldn’t have sex until closer to the end of the fic. Estimated total chapters is around 10-13ish

1iytj7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/rjpartnersupport/comments/1iytj7y/moving_on_and_moving_forwards/,Moving on and moving forwards,"Inspired by another post, I wanted to share my experience. It’s a long read, but was cathartic to get out. 

I’ve posted here under several different usernames seeking support, but always afraid my former partner would find them.

We broke up in September. The journey has been overwhelming and grief-filled - putting myself back together after being broken down by him, while also confronting deeper past traumas.

With him, I was self-destructing - drinking too much, smoking too much, hating myself too much. Now, all of that has stopped. 

Well, maybe not the self-hate, but that’s a process.

I’ve found a wonderful community focused on mental and physical health, and I feel so much stronger building myself up rather than tearing myself down with harmful coping mechanisms.

I’m exploring a relationship with someone who offers love and validation freely, not as something I have to earn. 

We listen to each other, support each other, and accept our pasts as parts of our story, not as weapons for shame or control.

He brings me flowers just because, not as an apology.

That doesn’t mean I don’t miss parts of my past relationship. I loved him. He used to tuck me in at night and make me coffee in the morning. I miss making crow sounds with him. Sometimes, I see something that reminds me of him and instinctively want to share it.

Not because I still have feelings for him - what I learned after our breakup made sure of that - but because at one point, I did. And despite the dysfunction, I truly loved every part of him.

But I no longer feel addicted to him. I no longer feel the pull to drive past his house or pour over his social media. That trauma bond is broken.

I’ve learned he’s with someone new, and I feel no jealousy or resentment. I just hope her past doesn’t become a battleground for their present and they both feel safe and secure. No matter how hard I tried, I could never give him that.

By the end of our relationship, we were both worn down - him by obsession, me by self-destruction. I hope that doesn’t happen again.

I’m healing. I’m hopeful. I hope he is too.",2,1740592232.0,rjpartnersupport,1,1.0,False

So there’s this girl in my bio class (both of us hs seniors) and blah blah she’s quite pretty and I’m thinking about approaching her, she’s new at my school this semester—I’m 99.9% sure she’s not taken but I’m also fairly sure and suspect I’ve received some strong looks in my direction. I’m a little intimidated by her looks to be completely honest (her being attractive I mean)

My plan was to approach her if I see her around campus and bring up that we have bio and stuff together and just tell her I think she’s cute and that I wanted to ask her for her number/snap—which I don’t feel is too much? Is there a different way I should do this?

I feel the need to (afterwards?) say something along the lines of like-if not, that’s totally fine and I don’t want to make things awkward for the rest of the semester (we don’t talk otherwise more like she doesn’t talk which I get bc she’s new and our school’s overwhelming as hell but the point is I don’t think either one of us can even be negatively affected by this) and I guess somehow suggest that I “need friends” in that class or at least don’t really know anyone—chat is this a good plan? (Plz don’t roast 😭)

I’m open to suggestions but I know this isn’t really “asking a girl out” which is why afterwards I was thinking of texting her after waiting a sec and stuff? Not too much but an appropriate amount where I can just say a few things and then maybe if I see her again at school and have another more face-to-face conversation before I ask if ‘she’d want to hang out’ or ‘go get food or coffee’ sometime after school?

I don’t want to ask her out over text because to me that feels rushed, also I want her to be more familiar with me because we like don’t know each other.

My goal is to nail this first conversation with a friendly vibe so that she feels comfortable with me off the bat, and then pursue her with more direct action after?

A question/concern I have is that I’m leaving this Thursday for a college visit and I’ll be gone the whole weekend, but that’s also the day I was for some reason planning on asking for her # (idrk why it just seems like the right day to bc we have bio that morning & our class schedule rotates all the time)
—But then the problem with that is that I won’t be at school on Friday or anything and I don’t wanna make her wait or make her ancy if she is interested, or idk if I should like just do it on thurs anyway and then just text her a couple times over the weekend, and see her the following week?

Some ideas we have:
- escort cards that look like the special edition metro cards using our photo (this might be hard)
- late night snack of pizza, custom to go boxes with our names
- tables named after some of our favorite places in Queens
- Greek coffee cups after dinner & at brunch the next morning

1iyt7xn,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1iyt7xn/modern_slavery_and_abusive_practices_in_a_local/,Modern slavery and abusive practices in a local bank,"I am a Product Owner in a local bank's Digital Business department, and my manager with severe insecurities has made the workplace highly toxic. Over the last three years, he provided me ample opportunities to build several digital products. However, every time the heavy lifting was 80% done, he would reallocate my efforts to his ‘favored’ product owners, asking me to support them for the last-mile closure. While they benefited from my yearly efforts, I ended up in a supporting role for projects I had driven from the ground up. Essentially, he made me a white-collar slave for our team.

* Things took a turn when he introduced me to senior stakeholders to support them in a separate workstream formation and executing nationwide initiatives, which I did double-hatting over weekends for the past 4 years. As I was getting small chunks of happiness from the recognition I received from senior leadership, which felt different from his persistent abuses.
* However, my manager’s insecurities reached new heights! when I started getting appreciation from seniors and even the opportunity to present Group CEO and media coverages over my accomplishments. His harassment intensified thereafter. When I told him I'd relieve myself from workstream duties if he is not comfortable anymore, he responded that the seniors were smart enough to know that he had instructed me to step down. That’s when he became even more abusive. He started making derogatory comments in office and would make me revise key presentations 18 times a day until he ensured that I missed my commitments to seniors. Then he told them that I do not deliver on my commitments and should not be relied upon, fabricating a false image of me.
* My manager kept threatening me that if I spoke out about his abuses, he would destroy my year-end rating for the 2nd year in a row. He mentioned leveraging his HOD friends to send negative feedback emails, stating me of being unreliable and deflecting work. He repeatedly mentioned that, as a manager, he has the power to shape the narrative with HODs and I must not question his decisions.
* He even frequently took me for coffee and started invading my personal life. He pressured me to cancel my wedding, stating most marriages end up in divorce or separation. When I refused, he would WhatsApp call during weekends demanding urgent tasks especially on weekends I informed him of plans with my fiancé. Eventually due to his persistent harassment, my wedding was called off. He yelled that my career would suffer in this bank if I married. The following year, I married anyway. During my marriage leave, he called, saying he lacked confidence in a team member (his favored colleague) and wanted me to take back a complex project and execute for him. I shortened my leave and started the work immediately after my marriage. Once the project was on verge of completion, yet again he handed it back to that same colleague. I was a fool to believe him despite knowing his manipulative tactics for years.
* After multiple harassments and more such incidents, for the first time, I gathered courage this year to speak up in the Internal employment survey. Surprisingly, my manager and his colleague called me over to their desk and questioning me by flashing on the big screen my comments, which was supposed to be a confidential and anonymous employment survey! That’s when I realized the state of Digital Business department, it is run terribly than I even thought, and my manager gains this confidence to abuse people because of HOD's backing! Now, during the year-end cycle, his threats became a reality for the 2nd year in a row. Despite my successful year - delivered 2 regional revenue initiatives, 1 market-first innovation, 2 regulatory projects and 1 nationwide initiative - my ratings were destroyed by him. Unfortunately, the Digital Business department at this local bank turns a blind eye to such toxic behaviors, allowing abusive managers to thrive while minority employees continue to suffer in silence. They actively promote modern slavery in this bank.
* When I spoke to my media colleagues with 3 years worth of evidences I had gathered including audio, they were very supportive and wanted me to have them published, as it substantiated the growing workplace harassment cases as reported by Strait Times earlier this month. Despite repeated advice from my well-wishers to take the media route, I chose to go to HR with the little ounce of remaining hope I had that 1) My abusive manager would for once say the precious words I have yearned for so long - 'sorry' and 2) I’d be provided justice from his abuses, and his discriminatory year-end ratings he gave me is reassessed justfully. Meanwhile, he walks around the office with a smile, proud of his achievement in destroying employees like me, and my HR report is still under processing.

I am really afraid of this abuser, and I really hope no other employees goes through what I experienced (more that I can't even share here) at this local bank.",5,1740591485.0,askSingapore,2,0.86,False
1iyt7d7,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1iyt7d7/automatic_installation_of_triton_and/,Automatic installation of Triton and SageAttention into Comfy v2.0,"**NB**: Please read through the code to ensure you are happy before using it. I take no responsibility as to its use or misuse.

**What is it?**

Essentially an updated version of the v1 [https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1ivkwnd/automatic\_installation\_of\_triton\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1ivkwnd/automatic_installation_of_triton_and/) \- it's a batch file to install the latest ComfyUI, make a venv within it and automatically install Triton and SageAttention for Wan(x), Hunyaun etc workflows .

Please feedback on issues. I just installed a Cuda2.4/Python3.12.8 and no hitches.

**What is SageAttention for ? where do I enable it n Comfy ?**

It makes the rendering of videos with Wan(x), Hunyuan, Cosmos etc much, much faster. In Kijai's video wrapper nodes, you'll see it in the below node/

https://preview.redd.it/tyfmcdkhtile1.png?width=286&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c0bf8ad20480263f6f9e7e2de12ff8f150676b2

**Issues with Posting Code on Reddit**

Posting code on Reddit is a weapons grade pita, it'll lose its formatting if you fart at it and editing is a time of your life that you'll never get back . If the script formatting goes tits up , then this script is also hosted (and far more easily copied) on my Github page : [https://github.com/Grey3016/ComfyAutoInstall/blob/main/AutoInstallBatchFile%20v2.0](https://github.com/Grey3016/ComfyAutoInstall/blob/main/AutoInstallBatchFile%20v2.0)

**How long does it take?**

It'll take less than around 10minutes even with downloading every component (speeds permitting). It pauses between each section to tell you what it's doing - you only need to press a button for it to carry on or make a choice.  You only need to copy scross your extra\_paths.yaml file to it afterwards and you're good to go.

**Updates in V2**

1. MSVC and CL.exe Path checks giving errors to some - the checks have now been simplified
2. The whole script - as it installs, it'll tell you what it's done and what it's doing next. Press key to move on to next part of install.
3. Better error checking to check Pytorch is installed correctly and the venv is activated
4. Choice of Stable and Nightly for Pytorch
5. It still installs Comfy Manager automatically and now gives you a choice of cloning in Kijai's Wan(x) repository if you want

**Pre-requisites (as per V1)**

1. Python > [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) , you can choose from whatever versions you have installed, not necessarily which one your systems uses via Paths (up to but not including 12.3).
2. Cuda > AND ADDED TO PATH (googe for a guide if needed)
3. BELOW: Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools with the components ticked that are required > [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

4. BELOW: MSVC Build Tools compiler CL.exe in the Paths (I had the screenshot pointing at the wrong location on the v1 post)

**What it can't (yet) do ?**

I initially installed Cuda 12.8 (with my 4090) and Pytorch 2.7 (with Cuda 12.8) was installed but Sage Attention errored out when it was compiling. And Torch's 2.7 nightly doesn't install TorchSDE & TorchVision which creates other issues. So I'm leaving it at that. This is for Cuda 2.4 / 2.6 but should work straight away with a stable Cuda 2.8 (when released).

**Recommended Installs (notes from across Github and guides)**

* Python 3.10 / 3.12
* Cuda 12.4 or 12.6 (definitely >12)
* Pytorch 2.6
* Triton 3.2 works with PyTorch >= 2.6 . Author recommends to upgrade to PyTorch 2.6 because there are several improvements to torch.compile. Triton 3.1 works with PyTorch >= 2.4 . PyTorch 2.3.x and older versions are not supported. When Triton installs, it also deletes its caches as this has been noted to stop it working.
* SageAttention Python>=3.9 , Pytorch>=2.3.0 , Triton>=3.0.0 , CUDA >=12.8 for Blackwell ie Nvidia 50xx, >=12.4 for fp8 support on Ada ie Nvidia 40xx, >=12.3 for fp8 support on Hopper ie Nvidia 30xx, >=12.0 for Ampere ie Nvidia 20xx

Mornings were the worst—she’d wake up groggy, chug coffee, and still feel like she was running on empty. Afternoons were no better, with energy crashes that left her craving sugary snacks. She knew she needed a change, but the idea of strict diets, endless calorie counting, and complicated meal plans felt overwhelming.

One day, her friend Sam introduced her to something different. *“Just try this,”* he said, handing her a warm cup of Unimate. It smelled rich, earthy, and comforting. Lisa took a sip. There was something about it—smooth yet energizing. She didn’t know why, but she felt... better.

The next morning, instead of reaching for coffee, she made herself Unimate. It became her quiet morning ritual, a moment just for her. She started feeling more awake, more focused. And the best part? No jitters, no crashes.

Sam also told her about Balance. *“Take it before meals. Just mix and drink. No need to change what you eat.”* It sounded almost too easy, but Lisa gave it a shot. She noticed she didn’t feel as sluggish after meals. Her cravings weren’t as strong. She felt more in control, without trying to be.

Days turned into weeks, and something incredible happened. Lisa wasn’t forcing herself to eat differently, but she naturally started making better choices. She wasn’t dieting—she was just feeling great.

It wasn’t magic. It was simple. A morning cup of Unimate. A quick Balance before meals. Eating what she loved. No rules, no restrictions—just feeling better, day by day.

And for the first time in a long time, Lisa felt like she was finally in sync with her body. Not fighting against it. Just… feeling great. ✨

1iyt5oz,https://www.reddit.com/r/GermanRoaches/comments/1iyt5oz/looking_for_advice_and_maybe_hopeful_words/,Looking for Advice and maybe hopeful words.,"First I would like to say I reached out to PCDurant after seeing his comments on posts and he pointed me in this direction, thank you.

My partner and I moved into our apartment a year ago, and have had no issues. In mid - late January, I found a nymph roach in the water tank of my Keurig. (Noticed it has a design flaw where it has a small opening on the lid of the tank). Took it sport, cleaned the removable pieces and ran vinegar through. A week or so later, I find another in the tank. Same thing, and we get spray and spray the baseboard and cabinet the coffee maker is in. I also got sticky traps and put them under the cabinet, in the kitchen, under the sink. Sprayed around the floors and under sink and kitchen also. My coffee maker was in a china cabinet in the dining room. 2 weeks after spraying, I find another nymph in the water tank. So I clean, and re apply spray.

I was assuming here they were traveling and going to the water, we are pretty clean and like mentioned we havnt had this for the first year+ we lived there.

Now - to last night. Another 2/3 weeks since last spray. I open my keurig to where you insert the k cup, and another quite small one is sitting there. It runs into the coffee maker

This was the first one I had seen actually in the machine so I re sprayed, and we decided to take the machine fully apart to clean. When taking apart the needle area, I found an egg casing that was empty. And I planned to freeze it (please don’t judge I had one of the fancier ones and I don’t like being wasteful so I was trying to save it) well unscrewed the bottom, popped the panel off and out runs a roach. This one was bigger - adult in size but I didn’t get a good look. Quickly started to freak out.

It ran out of the maker and to the back of the counter so we quickly bagged the coffee maker, took it out to the dumpster, and we managed to catch the roach that had ran out.

So where I am going with this - we have not seen them anywhere else. Not in the actual kitchen or bathroom. Most of my food is closed but I do have some in packaging with clips, nothing. My partner also works night, and frequently ether comes home after the living areas have been dark and undisturbed for a few hours, or goes out to the kitchen in the very early morning and has never seen any. My coffee maker I saw them all in the evening. Through my cabinet is a bit dark.

Do we have an infestation or did we get a female traveler that nested in my coffee maker by chance? Our building does twice a year inspections and I don’t know if anyone who would be an issue - however we did have a small number of them at my work. 4 total found - our pest control provider put out sticky traps and stopped finding them and deemed us clean.

I also have never found one on my sticky traps.

How concerned should I be? I plan to keep the sticky traps out, but if I replace my coffee maker how do I keep this from happening again? 

I have been stressing hard and doom scrolling. Not a good feeling. Any advice or input on similar stories is appreciated.

1iyt4x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1iyt4x7/abusive_relationship_false_accusations/,"Abusive Relationship, false accusations","I am going to explain a situation that I am currently in. For context, I am 26 years old, she is 25 years old and we are both in our final years at university.

At the start, she came across as very sweet, calm, and charming. We started talking, eventually going on dates, and it was clear we were very interested in each other. Early on, she told me she struggles with skin-picking and depression, but I was fine with that. I did, however, mention that I would be compromising on my views about veganism since she’s vegan.

After around 3 weeks of dating, we officially got into a relationship, and we agreed that we could be mature and come to each other about any issues. Things were going well. Everything seemed good, no arguments, no big issues. She made me think that this was going to be a stable long-term relationship. We had plans to spend time at my father’s house over the Christmas period and celebrate Christmas at my mother’s house. We were both looking forward to it since my father works away, meaning we’d have the house to ourselves. However, at one point, we were playing chess, and I took her queen. She then proceeded to slap me across the cheek. Although it wasn’t hard, it really took me by surprise.

Two weeks before Christmas, one morning she completely ignoring my existence. She didn’t look at me, talk to me, even acknowledge I was there. I tried talking to her, but she didn’t respond. This upset me and I was wondering what was wrong with her. That evening, I knocked on her door and asked her if she would like to come for a walk to talk. She suddenly broke up with me. She gave vague excuses like, “Your room is messy,” “You spend too much time on the PC” (even though I’m a final-year computer science student), and “I want to go do crazy stuff” (by this, she meant sleeping with people). She also mentioned wanting to “go to Africa to save the children”. This felt like a complete smack in the face, as she didn’t give any real reasons as to why she decided this, seemingly out of the blue. The day before this, everything was as good as ever. I will admit, my reaction to this wasn’t the best. I sent her a not-so-nice text message, that explained that I was hurt and showed my disappointment about her actions. This message, admittedly, soured the situation more.

Feeling regretful, I wrote her an apology note and decided to leave early for Christmas.

I ended up spending Christmas alone. During this Christmas period, I was very hurt, alone and struggling with stress due to my upcoming exams.

When I went back to Nottingham after Christmas, just before New Years, my plan was to just be civil and try not to talk to her. The morning after I came back (New Years Eve), she came into the kitchen and said “What, you’re ignoring me?”. I shook my head, because I did not want to speak to her as I was still hurt from her breakup.

During the evening on new years eve, she and our housemate were being very passive-aggressive, mocking me and not being nice. Also, during this time, our housemate slapped her on her upper leg, near her bottom. She didn’t want this to happen, and she visibly didn’t like it.

I decided to break the silence with her, because of the passive-aggressiveness, and because she had just been slapped (possibly sexually as it was close to her bottom). I asked her to come for a walk to talk about things. During this conversation, I explained to her about how her actions impacted me, and I also suggested that she stop going for walks by herself at night (this was something I was concerned about, even before the breakup). During this talk, she mentioned that the real reason she broke up with me is because “I made her cry once when we first started dating”.

We spoke more over the next couple of days. She also mentioned how “she missed me every day” and “I love you”. Despite this, she did not apologise, and she did not seem remorseful. I had to ask her to say sorry, and when she did, it didn’t seem sincere. She started promising me that she will change and be better, suggesting that she wants to get back with me. I said “ok, but it might take me a while to build some trust again, because you really hurt me”. Shortly after, she said “oh, im going to Milan for by birthday with my course mates. How are you feeling about your exams now?”. She said this with a smirk on her face and she knew I was struggling with exams, trust and hurt from her previous breakup, and this hurt. A lot. At this time, she could have backed out at any point as no flights had been booked. I said, “It really hurt me that you would rather go to Milan than spend it with me, I already was making plans for it"". She reacted by saying, “Stop controlling me,” and “If you don’t like it, break up with me”. She also said during this conversation that it not a mandatory part of her course. At this point, I was past caring, so I didn't mention it again and I tried to make the relationship work. I appologised for my words.

I also confronted our housemate about slapping her, saying to him that it was inappropriate, and that she didn’t want him to do it.

During the next month, everything was going great, but after a week or so startd she said a lot of hurtful things and tried to change history to avoid accountability. Here are some examples:   
  
One time she said, “you’re making it so hard for me to like you”. So, I asked “why?”. She replied “because you weren’t nice to our housemate” even though our housemate slapped her. I believe she was referring to the time I confronted him about her slap, which was actually over text message. One night, we are in my bed, and she says, “I want to do crazy stuff, but not right now” and “I want someone with more mass and taller”. These comments were very hurtful. I rolled over, said “night” and tried to go to sleep. 5 minutes later, she leaves my room. In the morning, she is acting off with me, ignoring me, being passive aggressive. I ask her whats wrong she said, “oh I just didn’t sleep very well”. Later in that day, she is still off with me, so I asked her again. She replied, “You didn’t cuddle me last night”. I told her that she isn’t making sense, and her comments were very hurtful. She did not apologise or even acknowledge that her words were hurtful. She also excused her words by saying “I was just thinking out loud” with a smirk on her face. Another time, she said “I wouldn’t have gone to Milan if we hadn’t broken up before Christmas” even though she broke up with me. I pointed out this contradiction to her and she didn’t reply and brushed it off.

Another thing she said is “At first I didn’t want to date you and I wasn’t interested in you” and then she said “but I was interested in the guy I met at Roxy’s (on one of our dates) and I thought that I had finally found someone”.

She also justified cheating by saying “I would only cheat on you if I thought you didn’t care about me” She also accused me of shouting at her when we had a disagreement, even though I never shouted at her, not once. I also spoke to her about her trip to Milan again, this time, she said that the trip is mandatory.

Also, during this time, she slapped me on multiple occasions during disagreements, even after I told her to never do it again. She also would give me the silent treatment and threaten the relationship if I even disagreed with anything she said.

One day she said, “I’m going to the cinema. Do you want to come with me?” The way she phrased it caught me off guard, almost like she was “allowing” me to come. I said ok. We When we got to the cinema, she sat down in a different seat, far from me, while smirking. I was confused and upset, so I got up and left the cinema to go home. A few hours later, she came to me and said, “I’m breaking up with you. How dare you leave me in the cinema,” with absolutely no acknowledgment of how her behaviour affected me. She could clearly see I was upset. This completely devastated me.

I blocked her, I went no contact. We still saw each other around the house, but we didn’t speak. A month goes by...

One day I accidently knocked her wooden blocks that were on the coffee table. These blocks were laid on top of a wood sheet and were supposed to represent houses for her architect uni work. These wooden blocks and patches of grass werent stuck down, so when my mug hit the wooden board, it slid under everything, causing the wooden block and grass patch to be mispositioned on the wooden board. It would have taken 2 seconds to move them back into their correct place. She follows me through the house, shouting at me. I tell her to “go away, I don’t want to talk, you are abusive”. She replied: “what are you going to do? Hit me? Go on, hit me”. I just looked at her. I was a bit weirded out.

After this incident, we start talking again. I tried to explain how her actions: ditching me in the cinema, then breaking up with me, were a terrible thing to do to someone. She complained that I “destroyed” her architect model. It obviously was not destroyed as nothing was actually broken , just moved around slightly because she left it unstuck in the living room. It was literally just a wooden board with a wooden block and a patch of soil/grass on it.

I also explained about how her previous actions, such as ditching me for Milan on her birthday me were hurtful. She replied, “you never said that it (going to Milan) would hurt you”. I did explicitly say those words to her, earlier on, when she told me about the trip. I told her about her physical abuse, slapping me, and she replied “its fine they werent hard, they were friendly slaps”. This is dispite me telling her explicitly to not slap me again.

I explained about how her words were hurtful, I explained how telling someone you are in a relationship with “I want to do crazy stuff” is very hurtful and not ok. She then she said: by saying “by crazy stuff, I meant travelling”. There was absolutely no misunderstanding about what “crazy stuff” meant, as she has said this before when she broke up with me before Christmas. I also mentioned that the way she asked if I wanted to go the cinema was a bit odd. Her response: “It wasn’t a date, I was planning on going alone and I wasn’t planning on bringing you”.

Despite all of this, she failed to take any accountability, she didn’t apologise (even when asked) and tried to trick me into thinking that I ditched her at the cinema. She even started saying “its so hard to like you” and “im scared of you”. I had never given her a reason to fear me, but she had given me to fear her, as she slapped me on multiple occasions.

She also mentioned that she is moving house. While she was moving, I offered to help and she told me go away. I tried being kind, I tried to reason with her, even an apology from her would’ve gone far. I was obviously frustrated, sad, and angry that someone would attempt to manipulate me and treat me like dirt. I said to her face “you are a bitch, a narcissistic piece of shit”. Then she slapped me, very hard, across the face. So, I snapped and pushed her away from me. She hit a door frame and got a small mark on her face. After some shouting, I went up into my room and she moved out.

After this, her mother messaged me, calling me a psychopath, abusive and said she has contacted my university and if i ever touch her again she will go to the police. I blocked her and didnt respond.

This morning, my landlord came to my house and told me that she told him that I hit her. He doesn't know if she has contacted our uni, or has gone to the police. I told the landlord that I didn't hit her and that she was the one that slapped me in the relationship and was emotionally abusive.

I want to say that my words over text towards her were not good. they were quite hurtful and contained a lot of swears, but they did also describe what she did to me. These messages were sent when she broke up with me, on both occasions (before Christmas and after cinema incident). I deeply regret my words and I feel embrassed that I reacted this way. It was not constructive or helpful. 

I feel so anxious and scared. I don't know what is going to happen next. I don't know if I should go to the uni premptively, I don't know if I should move out of this house away from our uni (I move back home and travel it into uni if needed). I don't know what she is or will tell people next. My head is spinning and I feel like complete shit.

What should I do?

1iyt4dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iyt4dv/any_luck_slow_feeding_a_df54_breville_barista/,Any luck slow feeding a DF54? [Breville Barista Express / DF54],"DF54 with BBE using Normcore bottomless portafilter.

Weigh out 18.5g, RDT, and grind at around 18 (post-zeroing the burrs via chirp), and I get around a 1:2 ratio. Pulling shots manually, with 10 sec preinfusion, aiming for 25 sec post-PI, so total of \~35sec, and around a 35-37g yield (not unusual for me to overshoot that, though).  
  
I'm using a medium dark roast(not oily dark) blend from a local roaster, very fresh (< 2 weeks off roast). 

Shots pulled this way are OK, but a little bitter and muddy. Coffee drinks made with them are plenty tasty. I have recently seen posts indicating that PI may be anywhere from not needed to detrimental for medium/dark roasts, so it's possible that PI could be the cause of the muddy/bitter I'm getting with my shots.

That said, looking for a little more clarity, I’ve been trying out slow feeding. But I’m not sure if my DF54 can grind as finely as I need it to with slow feeding without clogging (which ends up creating more fines, so losing the benefit of slow feeding).

Just curious if anyone out there has had luck with slow feeding with a DF54, and if so, roughly where you ended up with the grind size, relative to zero/chirp?

Would love to hear success stories on slow feeding with DF54, or also open to advice to just pass on slow-feeding for now and potentially reduce or omit pre-infusion, given the darkness of the roast.

Short-term rentals can be incredibly profitable, but only if you get things right. A simple mistake—like poor pricing, bad photos, or slow responses—can cost you *thousands of dollars a year*.

The good news? *Most hosting mistakes are easy to fix* once you know what to look for. Whether you’re just getting started or have been renting out your space for years, avoiding these pitfalls can *turn an underperforming property into a high-earning success*.

At [*Llivo*](https://www.llivo.com/), we’ve seen hosts *lose up to 40% of their potential earnings* due to common errors. Here’s what they are—and, more importantly, how to fix them.

https://preview.redd.it/tfs7cc8ypile1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d9eb6a847cc331d11f3b8cb8b0029219aa2c354

# 1. Your Pricing Strategy is Hurting Your Profits

*The Problem:* Pricing a rental is tricky. Charge too much, and you’ll struggle to attract guests. Charge too little, and you’ll fill your calendar but lose out on revenue. Many hosts either *fail to adjust prices based on demand* or *set a flat rate that doesn’t account for peak and off-peak seasons*.

*The Fix:*

* Use *dynamic pricing tools* that adjust rates based on seasonality, local events, and market demand.
* Offer *long-stay discounts* to attract digital nomads and business travelers.
* Keep an eye on competitors—see what similar listings charge and position yourself accordingly.

*Hosts who optimize their pricing strategy can increase revenue by up to 40%.*

# 2. Your Photos Aren’t Selling Your Property

*The Problem:* Guests *book with their eyes*—and low-quality images can make even a great rental look uninviting. A cluttered, poorly lit space with dull photos won’t grab attention, no matter how nice it is in real life.

*The Fix:*

* Invest in *professional photography* or, at the very least, use a high-quality smartphone camera with good lighting.
* Showcase *key features*, such as cozy seating areas, well-made beds, and unique décor.
* Make sure your cover photo is *bright, clean, and inviting*—it’s the first thing potential guests will see.

*Listings with high-quality images receive up to 50% more bookings.*

# 3. You’re Losing Guests with Poor Communication

*The Problem:* Slow responses, unclear check-in instructions, and lack of guest support *lead to frustration and negative reviews*. Many hosts underestimate how crucial communication is to the guest experience.

*The Fix:*

* Set up *automated messaging* for instant replies to common questions.
* Provide a *detailed digital welcome guide* with check-in instructions, Wi-Fi passwords, and house rules.
* Be available (or have a co-host) to *quickly respond to guest concerns*.

*90% of guests say fast communication influences their decision to book.*

# 4. Your Guest Experience is Forgettable (or Worse, Disappointing)

*The Problem:* A lack of thoughtful touches—uncomfortable beds, outdated furniture, or missing essentials—makes guests feel like they’re *staying somewhere generic* rather than a special home-away-from-home.

*The Fix:*

* Upgrade to *hotel-quality bedding* and *memory foam mattresses*—a good night’s sleep is the number one thing guests remember.
* Stock the kitchen with *basic cooking essentials*—oil, spices, coffee, and tea go a long way.
* Add *local recommendations* to help guests explore the area like a local.

*Great guest experiences lead to repeat bookings and glowing reviews, which boost your ranking.*

# 5. You’re Ignoring Reviews (or Handling Them Poorly)

*The Problem:* Bad reviews hurt your business—but ignoring them is even worse. A *lack of response makes it look like you don’t care*, and potential guests might hesitate to book.

*The Fix:*

* *Always respond* to reviews—whether positive or negative. Thank guests for good reviews and professionally address complaints.
* Use *negative feedback as an opportunity* to improve your rental. If multiple guests complain about the same issue (weak Wi-Fi, uncomfortable beds), fix it.
* Encourage guests to *leave a review* by sending a polite post-stay message.

*Engaged hosts with high response rates attract more bookings and build trust.*

# How Much Are These Mistakes Costing You?

Small oversights in managing a rental property can lead to significant financial losses each year. A poor pricing strategy alone can cost between *$5,000 and $10,000*, while low-quality photos may result in losses of *$3,000 to $7,000* due to reduced bookings. Bad communication with guests can lead to missed opportunities, costing *$2,000 to $5,000* annually. Failing to provide essential amenities could result in *$3,000 to $6,000* in lost revenue, and ignoring guest reviews might cost an additional *$2,000 to $4,000*. Something as simple as not having a house manual can impact bookings by *$1,000 to $3,000*, while neglecting maintenance may lead to losses of *$2,000 to $5,000*. Altogether, these mistakes can add up to a staggering *$18,000 to $40,000+* per year.

*The good news? Every single one of these mistakes is fixable.*

# Final Words: Small Fixes, Big Profits

If you’re hosting a short-term rental, small mistakes can add up to huge financial losses. The best way to stay ahead is to *optimize your pricing, improve guest experience, and avoid costly errors*.

At [*Llivo*](https://www.llivo.com/p/managing-your-listing), we help hosts *increase their earnings and attract more bookings* by refining their listings, communication, and guest experience.

Don’t let small mistakes *cost you thousands*—start making smarter hosting decisions today!

Through the cracked door, he could hear Barry humming softly to himself, the broom whispering against the floor as he swept.

Tina was at the counter, muttering insults under her breath as she rang up a customer.

All of this was normal.

Then Frank glanced at the security monitor.

And for the first time in years, he paused.


---

One of the security cameras showed the front register.

Tina was there. Barry was sweeping.

And Todd was sitting on the counter like an employee.

Frank squinted.

The raccoon was perfectly still, like he was waiting for a customer to approach.

His little paws were placed neatly in front of him, as if he were prepared to assist.

His beady eyes were locked forward in unsettling professionalism.

Frank slowly turned his head and looked at the actual register.

Todd was still there.

Just sitting. Watching. Waiting.

Frank took a slow sip of his coffee.

Then he turned back to the security feed.

Todd was now looking directly at the camera.

Frank put down his coffee.

“…Huh.”


---

Frank stepped out of the break room and walked up to the register, standing next to Tina.

She didn’t acknowledge him.

Todd didn’t either.

Barry, still sweeping, smiled at him.

""You’re out of your office.""

Frank scratched his chin.

""Yeah.""

Silence.

Then he pointed at Todd.

""Why is there a raccoon behind the register?""

Tina barely looked up.

""Oh, that’s Todd.""

Frank nodded slowly.

""…And we're just allowing Todd to be here?""

Barry nodded.

""Of course.""

Tina shrugged.

""He’s basically staff now.""

Frank stared at them both, then down at Todd, who still hadn’t moved.

Todd blinked once.

Frank took a deep breath and exhaled.

""Okay.""

And then he turned around and walked away.


---

Frank went to his office.

He closed the door.

Sat down.

And very deliberately stared at his desk, willing himself to ignore what he had just seen.

Then, out of curiosity, he glanced at the security monitor again.

His own office camera showed him sitting at his desk.

That part was normal.

What was not normal was that the version of him on the screen wasn’t moving.

Frank squinted.

The camera feed version of him was just sitting there, staring blankly at the desk.

No breathing. No blinking. Completely motionless.

It wasn’t frozen—the timestamp was still ticking forward.

But it was like the Frank in the camera was just… waiting.

Frank took a sip of coffee.

The Frank on the screen did not.

Frank leaned slightly to the side in his chair.

The Frank in the camera did not.

He drummed his fingers on the desk.

The Frank in the camera did not.

Frank stared at the monitor.

The camera Frank stared back.

After a few long moments, he sighed, rubbed his temples, and reached for the monitor’s power button.

Then, right before his finger touched it—

The Frank on the screen smiled.

A small, unnatural, knowing smile.

Frank froze.

His real mouth remained unmoved.

But the Frank in the camera? Still smiling.

Frank pressed the button.

The screen flicked off.

He sat back in his chair.

Then he slowly turned, looked at the blank screen for a long moment, and said:

""…Nope.""


---

Frank decided that he hadn’t seen anything unusual tonight and that everything was fine.

So, to reinforce this new reality, he did what he always did—went to make another cup of coffee.

But when he stepped back into the main store, he stopped.

Barry was still sweeping.

Tina was still at the register.

And Todd was still sitting there, exactly as before.

But now?

Todd was wearing a name tag.

Frank blinked.

The name tag was small. Slightly crooked.

And it read:

""TODD - HAPPY TO HELP""

Frank stared at Barry.

""You gave the raccoon a name tag.""

Barry smiled.

""No.""

Frank frowned.

""Then why does he have one?""

Barry’s smile widened.

""That is an excellent question.""

Frank inhaled through his nose. Exhaled through his mouth.

Then, very slowly, he poured his coffee down the sink and walked back toward his office.


---

Frank closed the door behind him, ready to pretend the night was normal.

Then he froze.

Todd was in his office.

Sitting on his desk.

Still wearing the name tag.

Frank stared.

Todd blinked.

Frank opened the door again.

Barry was already there, standing directly outside his office.

Barry smiled.

""Something wrong?""

Frank opened his mouth.

Then closed it.

He slowly turned his head back toward Todd.

Todd tilted his head slightly.

Frank turned back to Barry.

""…I don’t want to deal with this.""

Barry nodded.

""Then don’t.""

Frank thought about that.

Then, without another word, he turned off the office lights, sat down at his desk, and put his head down.

Barry gently closed the office door.


---

Tina leaned on the counter, watching as Barry returned from Frank’s office.

""So?""

Barry picked up the broom again.

""He’s ignoring it.""

Tina sighed.

""No surprise.""

Barry hummed in agreement and continued sweeping.

Todd, still wearing the name tag, settled comfortably behind the register.

Tina took a long sip of coffee.

Then, to no one in particular, she muttered,

""I need to find a new job.""

It never really bothered me because I wasn't trying to conceive pa naman, but now that I am married and TTC, I was so frustrated na hindi ako nagkakaperiod. 

I went to different OBs and they all said na I have to lose weight, saying that while I look fit, I'm heavy on the scale. They also prescribed Mypcos (didn't work). Provera (worked but didn't work the next month when I stopped it). Tried Pureform's Inositol as well pero hindi rin nagwork. 

They said that being on the pill naman is just a bandaid solution. So I adjusted my lifestyle. I now walk for at least five kilometers every single day, and while I am 10 kg away from my early 20s body naka help ata..but it took a whole year! Inisip ko rin na maybe I need to stop eating sweets. 

Went on a processed sugar fast for a month -- jusko ang hirap, pero I would get my sugar fix from desserts and coffee made with Stevia. Now I don't look for sweets as much anymore.

Things that weren’t so great: the beach was not good at all there, very narrow stretch.  No smoothie bar and the dessert area wasn’t great.

-breville grind control vs delonghi truebrew (anyone have experience with these, definitely do not want to buy these and get keurig quality)

so finally i get my coffee right as he does and he follows me to my car and acted surprised that i was going home instead o hanging out with him. which was so odd but whatever, that was that. later that night, he follows me on instagram, which is weird bc he didn’t even know my last name. but we had one mutual follower so ig that’s how he found me? but the real kicker was that he only had like 10 followers. which i dont care abt follower count. i cared that he spoke with me for 10 minutes and followed me, so his bar for friending people on social media is low, and he STILL had like no followers. but i didn’t want to be mean so i accepted it and hoped that was that. 
but then i saw he DMed me and asked me out. he also asked a follow up question bc apparently i didn’t see the first DM for a few hours. so again, not wanting to be rude, just ignored the asking out question and answered the follow up very dryly and hoped that was enough of a hint to where i didn’t have to outright say “no i don’t want to go out” bc i hate doing that, which yeah that’s immature of me but i’m not perfect and i got anxious lol. but this dude continued to message me random questions every 3 days, sending me random posts with like band kid humor and whatnot. also in fear of sounding shallow, part of the reason i wasn’t into this guy was because 1) i cannot get into a relationship with someone more awkward than i am because i’m already so unbearable it would be awful 2) he was just boring 😔 and 3) he was weird. which again i like weird! usually. but he was weird in like a creepy off putting way? idk how to explain it, just got a weird guy feeling, which again maybe i’m being shallow but i trusted my gut and just didn’t answer a single message besides the reply i sent the first time i saw his DM. 
after about a week of him occasionally spamming my DM, he gets the hint that i’m not into it, and sends me something like “sorry i keep messaging you. im just a bit of a silly guy” and i again ignored it. and that was that for a while.
a MONTH goes by, and he DMs me again, saying something like “hey! haven’t seen you around!” and surprise! i ignored it again. a day after that, he sends me this long ass weird paragraph of him trying to make a joke that was just so madly unfunny it hurt. this paragraph took up the entire size of my screen bro. this was his most recent message, to which i so far have also ignored.
AITAH for continuing to ghost him instead of just bluntly telling him im not interested? he’s not mean or anything, i’m just really not into it and he’s somehow still not getting the hint. i also want to mention i have horrible anxiety, which is the root of my immaturity in even going for the ghosting method in the first place. and i’m working on it, trust me, but in this specific case i’m curious if i’m still being an asshole. additionally, i feel like i’m so shallow for rejecting this guy. i hate rejecting people. it feels so mean. especially my reasoning essentially being “idk he’s just weird.” the fact that he won’t leave me alone is also further putting me off from him, but again i’ve never explicitly told him to leave me alone. 
regardless of if i am the AH or not, i’d also love any advice on how to approach this or how to politely tell people no in the future. ",3,1740590297.0,AITAH,1,0.71,False

So I've got a bit of a mystery.
TLDR: Can I have gastritis even when my bloods show no inflammation at all + I'm not in any pain?

I caught Norovirus at beginning of Jan and was very very sick. Threw up like 10+ times and took a week to recover (the last few days I ate stuff like beans and tomato and was absolutely fine) I then had to travel back to uni (very physically taxing but still felt fine)

I was then an idiot because my family was all healed and eating whatever they wanted (they weren't as sick as me) so I followed as such. I had coffee, brownies, tomato soup, cheese and a tiny sip of alcohol 💀💀 awful decision.

I woke up one morning with awful acid reflux, regurgitation in my throat, SEVERE nausea, flatulence, bloating, belching, fatigue, lack of appetite, early satiety, mild constipation (which has mostly gone now.)

Went to a doctor as it didn't go away.
Anti-nausea pills, even strong ones, didn't work, and now I've been on PPis as they think it's gastritis. It's been 2.5 weeks of 20mg Omneprazole (now 40mg) and my symptoms haven't dissipated AT ALL. 

They did a load of blood tests and found my ferritin was low (always been low even when I had meat in my diet) and my serum folate + B12 were on lower ends of the spectrum. However - my inflammation marker (CRP) and basophil were really low. No signs of inflammation at all. And most importantly - I'm not in any pain?
I have no pain, just a stomach that feels tender, heavy, hot every now and then, constantly bloated and full and sensitive.
I've only gotten pain about 4-5 times in a month - and even then it lasts about 20 minutes, comes out of nowhere (no trigger) and is very very faint. More of an ache. Sometimes it feels like a light pinch, the other like something gently pushing outward from inside. It's parallel to my belly button, sometimes on the left, sometimes on the right. It's faint and infrequent enough that I don't need to react to it. It comes on an empty stomach, a full stomach, a stomach with 250ml of water, when I'm lying down, sitting up, walking - totally random.

I've been having a plain diet for a month and a bit. My parents tried to make me eat a more varied diet as I've lost 5kg and am still not hungry. The last week I tried a more varied diet (homemade bread, brioche, scones, teaspoon of jam a day, 0% fat kefir, peas, a tiny bit of shredded cheese, plain cooked chicken, homemade low-sugar, low-fat muffins) and it didn't make me feel HUGELY worse but it certainly didn't make me feel great. My parents were convinced my symptoms weren't getting better because I wasn't getting enough nutrition - I didn't believe them and hey-ho I think I've eaten stuff which probably irritated it more.

I have no idea what this could be. I'm going to try the 40mg of Omneprazole for another week (not hopeful as 20mg did utterly nothing)and an even plainer diet (any tips would be advised)

Statement No. 20210421/01

Statement of Annika Köhler regarding a children’s book she found at the University of Oldenburg and subsequent events.

Original Statement given on the 21^(st) April 2021 at the Liebwerk foundation, Hannover, Germany.

Statement translated from German for use in international archival cooperation by Lukas Meiwes, assistant to the head archivist at the Liebwerk foundation.



\+++ STATEMENT BEGINS +++

I really don’t know how to properly say all of this. I mean, if it weren’t happening to me, I’d probably not believe it myself. But that’s what you guys do, right? Believing weird stuff like this? So I thought I’d give it a shot, maybe you know what to do.

I’m currently enrolled in my seventh semester of German studies at the University of Oldenburg. For my bachelor’s thesis, I’m going to write about changes in German children’s literature through the ages. You know, medieval fairytales and the like. I haven’t started writing it yet, but I’m already scanning for proper literature. You know how this works.

Anyway, I was rummaging through books of cautionary tales at the university library, looking for some interesting primary literature, when I stumbled upon this little book, stuck between two larger ones and almost impossible to see. An illustrated 1897 issue of *Struwwelpeter*. I’ve seen a few versions of that book, my parents even read it to me when I was a child, but this one was different. It looked positively ancient, all worn and well-thumbed. Honestly, I was wondering how it even held together, with most of the spine missing and the pages almost torn out. No way this was actually part of the official library inventory. At the time, I thought it probably belonged into the archives or was part of a private collection of one of the professors and somehow made it into the library by accident. In any case, I had already planned on including *Struwwelpeter* in my thesis, so I figured using a relatively authentic old edition like this would be for the best. I tried checking it out, but it would not scan at the library computers. So I simply took it home with me.

When browsing the book a few hours later, I noticed that something was different from the one my parents had read to me. First of all, when trying to write down any bibliographical info I needed for my work, I quickly found out that this book had no official publisher. Best I could find was a small stamp indicating it once belonged to the library of some private collector, but that didn’t really help much.

Second, it included an additional story. As the other editions I already had seen, it had the classical tales. *Konrad Daumenlutscher*, *Hanns Guck-in-die-Luft* etc. But on top of those, it had *Die Geschichte von der Schmutzliesel*, which I had never heard of before.

Like most other stories in *Struwwelpeter*, it’s a tale about a child that won’t listen to their parents and consequently suffers some form of harm or punishment. In case of *Schmutzliesel*, it tells the tale of a little girl that won’t stop eating dirt, despite her mother warning her that some day her teeth would fall out. Then, Liesel bites onto some stones that are so hard her teeth break. I still remember how detailed the illustration and narration were in describing the pain Liesel suffered from it and I had nightmares about it for the better part of the next week. Needless to say, I stopped reading the book for a while after that.



Then, two days later, the thing with the teeth started.

I found the first one on my way to the gym. I probably wouldn’t have noticed it, if I hadn’t accidentally dropped my phone. When I bent down to pick it up and see if it had been damaged, I found a tooth lying on the pavement. A child’s tooth, from the size and looks of it, so I figured some child had lost a milk tooth there. It was weird, sure, but I didn’t think too much of it back then. But it wasn’t the last one.

The next one was the next day on my way to university. It was lying on a bin I threw an empty coffee cup into. Then, an additional one in an ashtray on campus. I tried talking to friends about it, but the teeth only seemed to show up when I was alone. That’s when I was slowly starting to really get freaked out by it.

Over the next days, the number of teeth I found grew. There was a small heap in front of my apartment door, another handful in the basement when I went to put some laundry into a community washing machine. Some of the teeth looked old, others fresh. Some were perfectly clean, others still had some skin and blood sticking to them. I thought someone was pulling an incredibly cruel prank on me, until one day I opened a brand new and sealed can of peanuts, only to find it full to the brim with bloodstained teeth. No way someone actually managed to sneak those into the can just for some sick laughs.

Of course I thought about calling the police. But what am I supposed to tell them? Even my friends seemed pretty weirded out by my first mentions of this stuff. And it’s not like that’s a good look, you know? Having piles of bloody teeth at home probably leads to a lot of bad questions.

I tried getting rid of them. Throwing them away at home or into public bins, I even tried burying them, god knows why. But the more I tried, the more appeared. I found them in shampoo bottles, in a ripped hoover cleaner bag and at one point they somehow made it into the stuffing of my pillow.

So I started to read the book again. There had to be something in there. But every time I just couldn’t bear looking at those illustrations of poor Liesel. Those tears running down her cheeks, the blood from the mouth. I swear, with every time I read it, it somehow got worse.

I had to get rid of the book, find someone that knew something about it. So I started looking it up on the web. And while I couldn’t find anything on this book and teeth in particular, I actually managed to find an antiquarian in Oldenburg that was willing to take the book. He even paid me for it, even though I probably would have given it away in any case.

For a few days afterwards, nothing happened and I actually thought it was over. That is, until I found some teeth in my cereals yesterday morning. So I came here, so you guys can help me.

I guess that’s it. All I have to say. Hopefully, you can do something with all of that, because I sure as hell can’t, and I can’t sleep any more. I just want these teeth to stop. So please, help me.

Oh. And you might want to clean out the coffee machine in the waiting room? I’m pretty sure I’ve seen a few teeth in the grinder.

\+++ STATEMENT ENDS +++



\+++ ARCHIVIST’S NOTES – KLAUS HAARMANN – 23^(rd) June 2021 +++

A Leitner. Of course it is a Leitner. What else is this supposed to be? And here I thought we had gotten rid of every single book that made it to Germany. It seems I was wrong. I’ve sent Becker to follow up on Miss Köhler’s statement in hopes of finding that antiquarian she mentioned. Not sure if we can do anything about the teeth, though.

\+++ADDENDUM – 26^(th) June 2021+++

No success in contacting Miss Köhler, unfortunately. According to other students on her student housing floor, she has not been seen for over a week now and her parents living in Cologne have filed a missing person case.

Maybe Becker can get someone from the police to look into Miss Köhler’s internet history to get a contact of that antiquarian? Not strictly legal, but it wouldn’t be the first time his charms worked wonders on someone on the force.

\+++ADDENDUM – 19^(th) July 2021+++

It seems we poked a bear here. While our contacts in the police didn’t yield anything useful, this morning, a police inspector came and asked about our relationship with and interest in Miss Köhler. It appears that she is either a prime suspect or at least a core witness in what seems to be a larger case of health insurance fraud.

According to police, her insurance company started an investigation after no less than five oral surgeons in and around Oldenburg claimed to have performed emergency operations on her, removing between one and seven (sic!) wisdom teeth.

While to the insurance company this obviously cannot be true, I’m inclined to believe the surgeons.

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) . I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation* ( mega important ) let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this while while having a drink and watching killtony vids   .sometimes I’m funny but don’t ask me to tell a joke ( that’s not how it works bro ) fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream( no I don’t have reasons why I just don’t , it’s not that deep ). I have adhd and think about a million thoughts a second it feels like . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

- Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning 🫶🏻)
- a lot of random playlists I’ve made 
- complaints about nonsensical things ( example the weather , how much milk cows produce , songs I wish didn’t exist ?)
- someone that you can annoy at any time of  the day 
- someone to have coffee dates with virtually ( no you don’t have to drink coffee I certainly will ) 
- just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings 
-Dutch memes but you won’t get ;) ( what a steal ! ) 

**disclaimer**

**DONT JUST SEND ME HI /HELLO/HEY/HOW ARE YOU ? If you do this I probably won’t answer so please send me a none boring intro (not just listing your hobbies pretty please )**

For instance, I’m new to Eugene and it would be super helpful to have a list of small businesses based on needs. Things like produce and coffee I feel like are an easy find, but what about things like towels or dishes or tools, etc. I can definitely do some research. 

It would also be great to have community to chat with or even meet up with regularly to help us stay the path. And to also build connections for trading purposes whether it’s trading goods or services.

If your curious about Shutdown 315:  The idea is for people to skip work and avoid spending money at major corporations for the day to protest corporate greed, systemic injustices, and policy rollbacks, especially around Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). The goal is to show the power of workers and consumers in pushing for economic and social change. Instead of shopping at big companies, people are encouraged to support local businesses and participate in community efforts.

If it smells good to me, I’m there. If I like it enough, I’ll eventually buy it. I am bored during a break at work, so here goes my off-the-cuff review (sorry, I’m also bad at describing scents but will try my best) -

* TF Tobacco Vanille - 8/10 (spicy and sweet, but sophisticated. I love this one, but I feel like I can only wear it when it’s decently cold, which is pretty rare from where I’m from on the TX gulf coast)

* TF Lost Cherry - 8/10 (Sweet fruit bomb with these mysterious masculine-leaning layers that become more exposed when it dries down. This one is actually my wife’s but I wear it occasionally too when it’s colder out b/c we both love it so much. Good god is this stuff loud though. Srsly only need 1-2 sprays of it before it gives you and everyone around you a migraine)

* TF Oud Wood - 9.5/10 (Cool unk vibes. Woody and spicy as hell with a tiny bit of oud in there to make it alluring. Probably my fave out of my entire collection; idc about seasons with this one: I’ll wear it till it’s blistering hot outside bc it smells so amazing. My only complaint is that I wish it’d last just a little longer)

* Creed Aventus - 7/10 (An in-your-face borderline unripe pineapple smell at the top with some pleasant woodiness that I enjoy throughout most of it. This one was a graduation gift; I’d never buy this myself and idk if I will replace it once i run out of it. I know this frag is considered kind of a basic/boring scent to some and I used to hate it, but I’ve kept it b/c it is hella expensive and it has honestly grown on me a lot over the year or so I’ve had it; will occasionally wear to the office. If it wasn’t so damn expensive, this stuff would be rated higher)

* Bleu de Chanel EDP - 8/10 (It’s in the name bruh. This is a clean blue scent with some pleasant powderiness throughout and some grapefruitiness at the top.This was also a gift; this is a basic-ass frag but idc b/c it smells great, is inoffensive, and is perfect for the office)

* Nautica Voyage - 9/10 (Generic blue, but it is a good spin on it and had some fruitiness that I really like. There is also some woodiness in there that is pleasant. This is cheap as hell but idc b/c I love it and have easily gotten the most compliments out of my whole collection while wearing it; great office frag that you can get like sub $15 a lot of the time. Longevity is not ideal, but it does a lot for how cheap it is)

* Acqua di Gio EDT - 8/10 (Throwback that was my very first scent. This is what fresh “blue” smells like to me, but there is some citrus in there too. I keep this around when I wanna smell like one of my uncles in the 90s; more of a once a week/every other week office/nostalgia wear when bleu, voyage, or aventus aren’t tickling my fancy)

* Lataffa Qaed Al Fursan - 9/10 (Sweet sweet  imo “linear” pineapple scent that is probably unisex but maybe leans slightly masculine? This was a blind buy at a TJ Maxx: this is the best fragrance $20 can buy imo and is fun to wear on a Friday at work or over the weekend. Only need a 1-4 sprays of this one before you’re choking people out imo. The atomizer on it kind of sucks so I’m docking it one point)

Here are some others that I am interested in (some I’ve sampled/smelled and some I haven’t) I’ll rate the ones I’ve smelled already:

* Prada Luna Rossa Ocean EDT - 10/10 (White powder with some “blue” qualities to it. The name is kind of deceiving imo. I have a sample of this that I’m almost out of. This stuff rocks and is at the top of my list of next to obtain)

* JPG Ultra Male/Afnan 9pm - 8/10 (Vanilla candy sweet bomb. I’m a married 31 y.o. professional with two children, so I am afraid that maybe I am too old for either of these, but I like them a lot. Both are SO intense too so idk if I’ll ever actually pull the trigger on either of these 😂)

* Mercedes Benz Sign - 10/10 (This also is very sweet and spicy but is not as sweet as like Tobacco Vanille or Ultra Male. I am also not sure what the consensus on this one is b/c I’ve never seen it discussed, but I had a sample of it and loved it; this one reminds me of Ultra Male/9pm but is imo a lot more dialed back and is thus probably more versatile; this is honestly right behind the Prada I mentioned earlier as the next scent I’m likely to get and only because it’s not so much of a summertime scent while the Prada is)

* Halloween Man X (this seems like it could be a cheap office wear for cold months but I’ve seen mixed opinions on it; I like coffee notes but have yet to actually smell it)

* Azzaro Most Wanted - 7/10 (Pleasant spiciness; I like this one a lot, but it is a lower priority for me; it’s like an inoffensive spicy scent you could probs wear to the office if you go light on it)

* Moschino Toy Boy (have seen this one on sale before at Ross and TJ Maxx for unreasonably low prices. I wish I’d snagged it back then b/c now that I know what this is, I’m very interested in it. That being said, I want to sample it first b/c I’ve heard that it is a polarizing frag and I have never actually smelled it)

* Polo Red EDP - 8.5/10 (Holiday spiciness. I smell some cranberry. Others say this one has some coffee in it, but I don’t smell it particularly, and though I like coffee notes, the coffee in the other reds isn’t my fave. The whole red line is underrated imo and the sample I have of this smells exactly like Christmas to me; I love it and idk why some dislike it)

1iyslu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1iyslu8/grocery_spend_interested_in_everyones_thoughts/,Grocery spend - interested in everyone's thoughts,"Evening all,

My wife and I have just been through a bit of an ‘exercise’ on our monthly grocery spend (yes, I am that boring) and I was interested to see what the UKPF community thoughts were. For reference we are a family of 4, 2 adults and 2 children under 10. We eat meat/fish but not every day. No pets.

I know comparison is the thief of joy etc. but I am genuinely curious, especially when I’ve fairly regularly seen people comment they are spending sub £100 per week for a family of 4.

 

After going through our detailed family budget/spending spreadsheet for 2024 I was quite shocked at how much we had spent on groceries compared to 2023 (I know inflation was a big part of this, but it was still up \~20% year on year). We therefore agreed to do a detailed track of everything we spent on groceries (we include household items here, basically anything you pick up for the house at the supermarket we class as groceries) in February to see if anything jumped out or if we could see any obvious savings.

 

So, here are the results:

Total                                      £652.48                               100%                    £163.12               £23.30

 

Some things to point out:

\-          Contribution was due to us going away with friends one weekend and they chipped in for the shop, wasn’t sure how best to show this.

\-          Household is things such as washing powder/conditioner, toilet paper, toothpaste, shower gel, wife’s face cream etc.

\-          We try to cook from scratch as much as possible (apart from Pizza it seems..)

\-          We get our milk mainly from a local milkman which will of course be more expensive than a supermarket, but we are happy with this.

\-          Kids have hot lunches in school not included in these figures.

\-          We bulk buy coffee beans and we’ve not had to buy any this month so a more accurate average would be higher to include this.

\-          We try and do ‘big shops’ at Aldi/Lidl but we do go to Sainsbury’s fairly regularly as well.

\-          We track every pound in and out through the month so I know this is complete (barring any small spends that might happen between today and the 28^(th))

 

My initial thoughts are overall it seems reasonable apart from maybe ‘snacks’ and ‘pop/squash’ (this is my vice) which seem on the high side.  Alcohol fluctuates generally, but as I mentioned we had a weekend away this month so spent more than usual this month.

 

So, what do you think? Anything look ridiculous to an outsider?

*Grinder 1zpresso K ultra*

*Brewing methods employed: Traditional Cupping, Aeropress and V60 for all comparisons, with consistent weight measurememts of beans and water across all brewing methods for fair evaluation*

*I don't take cues or mention the flavor notes mentioned by the Seller, rarely have I found them to be accurate and the flavor vocabulary of each Individual is different. I am a strict adherent of the faith that there is no perfect cup of coffee and each individual has their own flavour preferences which are mutable and bound to evolve with time and experience. Be open to experimentation and trial, there are no bad cups, just different ones. I find it of utmost importance to keep nuance out of my flavor description, keeping it to simple jargons such as sour, bitter and sweet. The points I make note of when covering flavor are:*

*Separation of flavours; some varieties inherently allow you to distinguish tastes of sourness, bitterness and that slight sweetness specific to coffee and I will mention this as high separation while others allow for a more mixed and emergent taste which I'd mark as low separation, while at times you will have something where flavors are distinguishable at the beginning of the sip while merge later to give an emergent aftertaste, such cases will be marked as medium seperation.*

*Taste travel; When you freshly brew your coffee and right around the time you can taste past the feeling of hotness, each coffee changes its taste as it approaches room temperature. For some entire separation of flavor order is changed as in if you were tasting bitterness first and then the sour flavors, if the taste travel is huge after a few minutes you may altogether miss on the bitterness and a new aftertaste might develop, or the intensity of Individual flavors might change. For such cases I mark them as High Taste travel, while if the intensity of flavours change with drop in temperature I will call that low taste travel. As some coffees give you different order of flavors as they cool down, most have a mere change in intensity of flavor which has nothing to do with the coffee bean but is a resultant effect of temperature itself.*

These are results of the green beans origin and processing as well as roasting. Given we can't choose our own roast level, unlike [Home blend Coffee](https://homeblendcoffee.com/), we're bound to the roasters vision for the bean.

Double ferment Medium light is bright and sparkly, Can't say if this is due to the processing or Roast profile.

Carbonic Maceration is the tangiest coffee of the lot. This is definitely due to the processing and not the roast profile. More imitations from the wine industry are always welcome, the cask aging other such processing methods do impart distinct flavors and methods from the wine industry are time tested.

The various processing methods employed have had clear impact on the taste profile when considering Naturals, Black Honey and Lactic ferment, given the roast profile and bean varietals are the same.

Naturals is something I would recommend to someone starting their coffee journey. I've found it so neutral and inherently balanced in aspects of body, sweetness, sourness and bitterness (but in a boring way if you're a coffee veteran) that I'm quite inclined to make it my benchmark. To put it in other words, someone starting out can figure out their taste preferences if they're inclined towards the tangy/ sour notes or the more earthy ones and move from here. It's quite a task to make something so devoid of style that it becomes a benchmark, if this was intentional, Kudos and if not please keep it this way, this is much needed.

Black honey has a beautiful travel of taste from earthy notes and taste to a balanced cup and back to an earthy cup with ever so slight tangy aftertaste, the Lactic ferment also leans toward earthy notes but is reveals quiet subtle flavours.

The Washed Dark roast is their french roast, that Burnt wood/ Earthy flavor is all it sports, from start to finish.

**Ethics**

The second wave was about making coffee accessible and the Third wave is all about consumer awareness. Their coffee is traceable to the farm, which itself is operated off the grid, and given their particular disinterest in collecting certifications, quite the anti- [Araku](https://www.arakucoffee.in/) way. They have a gas operated roaster and given how expensive such upgrades are, this could be disregarded.

So there’s this girl in my bio class (both of us hs seniors) and blah blah she’s quite pretty and I’m thinking about approaching her, she’s new at my school this semester—I’m 99.9% sure she’s not taken but I’m also fairly sure and suspect I’ve received some strong looks in my direction. I’m a little intimidated by her looks to be completely honest (her being attractive I mean)

My plan was to approach her if I see her around campus and bring up that we have bio and stuff together and just tell her I think she’s cute and that I wanted to ask her for her number/snap—which I don’t feel is too much? Is there a different way I should do this?

I feel the need to (afterwards?) say something along the lines of like-if not, that’s totally fine and I don’t want to make things awkward for the rest of the semester (we don’t talk otherwise more like she doesn’t talk which I get bc she’s new and our school’s overwhelming as hell but the point is I don’t think either one of us can even be negatively affected by this) and I guess somehow suggest that I “need friends” in that class or at least don’t really know anyone—chat is this a good plan? (Plz don’t roast 😭)

I’m open to suggestions but I know this isn’t really “asking a girl out” which is why afterwards I was thinking of texting her after waiting a sec and stuff? Not too much but an appropriate amount where I can just say a few things and then maybe if I see her again at school and have another more face-to-face conversation before I ask if ‘she’d want to hang out’ or ‘go get food or coffee’ sometime after school?

I don’t want to ask her out over text because to me that feels rushed, also I want her to be more familiar with me because we like don’t know each other.

My goal is to nail this first conversation with a friendly vibe so that she feels comfortable with me off the bat, and then pursue her with more direct action after?

A question/concern I have is that I’m leaving this Thursday for a college visit and I’ll be gone the whole weekend, but that’s also the day I was for some reason planning on asking for her # (idrk why it just seems like the right day to bc we have bio that morning & our class schedule rotates all the time)
—But then the problem with that is that I won’t be at school on Friday or anything and I don’t wanna make her wait or make her ancy if she is interested, or idk if I should like just do it on thurs anyway and then just text her a couple times over the weekend, and see her the following week? OR if I should wait until next week to do any of this at all. Any suggestions? Open to absolutely anything—the how or the when",0,1740589491.0,AdviceForTeens,5,0.33,False

1iysagb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iysagb/i_think_my_mom_inherited_a_haunted_house/,I Think My Mom Inherited A Haunted House,"A few weeks ago, my mom got a phone call that I thought was gonna change our lives for the better. Now I think that call might have put us in terrible danger. I want to document what I’ve been experiencing in case… *in case something happens to us.* 

  
The day had started like almost every day since the accident. 



Our dog Max had jumped onto my bed while it was still dark out, needing a walk and a fresh bowl of food. Before I left to take him around the block I’d checked in on my mom. Her room was dark. Her breathing even. She was sleeping soundly. *Good.* 



She was still asleep when I returned. She slept while I cooked breakfast. While I did the dishes. While I showered and got ready for school. While I packed a lunch for myself, and for her, which I’d leave in the ‘fridge for later. 



I was shoving clothes into a woven laundry bag to drag to the basement machines when I got home from school later when I heard her scream.



“Mom??” 



I ran to her room, Max on my heels, and pushed open the door to find her sitting up in bed, arms wrapped around her legs, her head resting on her knees, sobbing. “He.. was… *here*,” she said between hiccuped breaths.



She didn’t say who, but she didn’t have to. I knew who *he* was. My dad, Ben. The thing is, he couldn’t have been here. A year ago, he’d been driving mom and my little brother Davey into the city when he’d hit a patch of ice and they’d skidded off the road and into a freezing river. 



Mom had been the only one to make it out of the car. But she hadn’t, really. Mentally, she was still stuck there, frozen under the ice, trapped in her grief.



I wasn’t doing much better. Sometimes I could barely drag myself out of bed. Sometimes I swear I could hear my dad calling me from the other room, or Davey giggling as he played with Max. But someone had to take care of us, so I’d taken over doing most everything around the house, because if I didn’t, nobody would. Mom just… *couldn’t.* Not yet. I’d been clinging to a tiny sliver of hope that she was starting to come back. She hadn’t had a nightmare in three days. But now…



“Emma, I *saw* him and he was…” she looked up at me, her eyes red-rimmed and brimming with tears, “he opened his mouth and, and… *water* spilled out…” 



She buried her head again and I sank down onto the bed next to her, stroking her hair. “It’s okay, mom. You’re safe.” I repeated it over and over, the words like a chant, until I felt her shoulders sag and her breathing even out. “You’re safe.”



I’d tucked her back in when she refused to get up and have something to eat. She was *so tired*, she said, insisting that she *just needed some rest.* So I quietly shooed Max out of the room and closed the door behind us just as the phone rang.



I mentally prepared myself to get an earful from Barb about how mom hadn’t shown up for her breakfast shift this morning at the diner. Barb was understanding, but only to a point. She still had a business to run, she’d tell me, and if mom was gonna keep no-showing, she was gonna have to replace her. 



I moved into the living room, where Max playfully bounced around, excited at the ringing coming from underneath a pile of papers on the coffee table.



No, not papers. Bills. All of them long overdue.



I sank to the couch, dug out the cell phone, took a deep breath, and answered, certain I could find a way to buy us some more time before Barb cut mom loose. “Hey Barb, I’m so sorry but mom…”



“Hello, is this Alison?”



“...This is her daughter, Emma. I’m sorry, she can’t come to the phone right now, can I take a message?”



“My name is Valerie, and I’m calling regarding her grandfather, Hugh. Your great-grandfather, I suppose.”



I’d never met Hugh, and I’d only found out about him when I had to do a genealogy project for school. Even then it hadn’t been much. We didn’t really speak to that side of the family back then, and mom was the only one left living now. And either way, this woman was going to be out of luck because…



“I’m sorry, Hugh passed away years ago,” I said, “so I’m not sure how she could help…”



“I’m afraid that’s incorrect... And I'm sorry to tell you this, but Hugh died last week. He’s left your mother a rather substantial inheritance. Do you know when she’ll be available to speak?”



Needless to say, I got my mom out of bed. I sat next to her on the couch as she took the call from Valerie, bleary-eyed and half-asleep. As Valerie gave her the details, I watched the fog she’d been existing in start to dissipate. By the time she hung up, she was clear in a way I hadn’t seen in months.



“*Tell me,”* I’d urged.



I could practically see her mind working to process what she’d just been told. “Hugh didn’t die of cancer when you were little. Grandma lied to me.”



My grandma. Her mother. “Why would she do that?”



Mom shrugged. “I don’t know why Grandma did a lot of things. There’s a reason you never met her,” she said bitterly. “Hugh left us a small sum of money…”



“I thought the lady said *substantial…*”



“He also left us his house. His *estate*, she’d called it. Valerie is the estate agent.”



Estate. “That sounds… bigger than a normal house,” I said.



Mom nodded. “Quite a bit.” She looked around our cramped apartment as if seeing it for the first time.



My mind raced. “If we sold it, we could get out of here. We could pay these bills and move back *home*.”



Home, where we’d lived with dad and Davey as a family. Back to the house we’d had to sell after the accident, because there was no way mom could pay the mortgage on her own. It was still vacant, waiting for a buyer. With the money we’d make from selling an *estate*, it could be ours again. We could go back to the place where we’d lived with *them.* 



I’d started to well up. “Mom…”



“Valerie warned me that the place isn’t in the best shape. Hugh was in his nineties. He couldn’t keep up with it.” Her eyes landed on the pile of past-due bills on the coffee table in front of her. “I can use the money he left us to pay these off. Get out of our lease early. We can move into the estate and…”



“We can fix it up, mom. Get it ready to sell. I’ll help. We can *do this…*” Hope blossomed in my chest. Just the tiniest spark, but it was there, and I clung to it.



The corners of my mom’s lips twisted up just the slightest bit. It was the closest I’d seen to a smile in months. I’d take it. 



\*\*\*



A week later, we left that tiny apartment for good and headed for our new, temporary home. Hugh lived across the state line, on the shores of a lake that’s a very popular tourist destination. I’m not going to give the town’s proper name because after a few weeks here, I think the house, and maybe the lake it sits next to… I think there might be something wrong with them, and I don’t want anyone to get curious and come looking. 



Mom had handled the drive okay. When we’d hit a pothole I could see her white-knuckling the wheel in a way she didn’t used to before the accident, but her mood stayed even and she even sang along to a couple of songs on the radio. It felt almost normal. 



After six hours on the road and a couple of stops for Max to stretch his legs, we pulled onto the road that circled the massive lake. As we drove by, I got a chance to see just how popular this place was. Huge resorts and dozens of cabins dotted the lake’s shores, and hundreds of tourists were laying out on beaches, or driving boats, or tubing on the waters.



“This is it,” mom said, pointing to a small mailbox next to a secluded driveway lined with thick trees. We rumbled down what had to be a mile of asphalt and emerged into a circular drive that brought us right up to Hugh’s front door.



When I tell you the house is big, I mean… *huge* is an understatement. Three stories. A carriage house. A separate garage that could hold at least four cars. And grounds in the back that must stretch a hundred yards to the water. It’s sprawling. At first glance I was actually stunned.



Then I took a closer look, and saw the weeds poking up through the cracks in the drive. The dust on the windows. The peeling paint and missing shingles. All that wealth, and Hugh had just let it start to *rot.* 



Max was excited for our new adventure. He practically jumped out the open window of the truck the moment we’d stopped and got to work sniffing everything he could get his nose on. He ran around the side of the house just as a woman emerged from the front door.



“Alison? I’m Valerie. We spoke on the phone regarding your grandfather’s estate.” 



She carried a clipboard and wore a tailored jacket and skirt. Her professional smile didn’t quite reach her eyes as she held out a set of keys. “Welcome home.”



Mom took the keys, weighing them in her hand, as if not quite believing they, or this house, were real. 



“Why don’t I show you the back before we head inside?” Valerie said. “Give you a lay of the very substantial land.”



We followed her around the side of the estate and onto a lawn that hadn’t been cut in months. “That’s a private beach,” Valerie said, pointing to the sand in the distance. A dock stretched out into the dark blue water, and a sailboat was tied to a post at its end. “And the property stretches for twenty acres on either side of those tree lines.”



I stepped onto the wood slats of the dock and gazed out at the vacationers partying on the lake. I couldn’t believe that this was currently my life. When I turned back, I saw that mom hadn’t followed me out. She hadn’t gone near the water since the accident.



And then she turned to Valerie and dropped a bomb: “You said they found Hugh’s body in the water?”



*What.* I scrambled off the dock and back onto solid land.



Looking mildly uncomfortable, Valerie nodded. 



“Did he drown?” 



“...I believe so, yes.” Valerie answered. “I can’t speak to the details, but…”



“But you must know something,” I pushed, continuing to put distance between myself and the water lapping at the beach. “If you’re handling this place. I mean, we don’t know anything about him…”



“It’s all speculation, of course, but… rumor was that Hugh wouldn’t go near the water. Ever.”



“But somehow he ended up out there?” I asked, pointing to the waves. “And not just that, but he decided to live next to a lake for decades?”



Valerie seemed to catch herself. As if she was embarrassed that she’d even speak about these rumors. “All idle gossip. You know how small town people talk. How about we go inside?”



And that was the end of that.



We followed her in. There was the foyer, with soaring ceilings and dark hardwood floors. A massive living room off to one side with thick, plush rugs and overstuffed leather furniture. Just those two rooms alone were bigger than the apartment we’d just left.



But the wood was scuffed. The paint was chipped. The wallpaper was peeling. Valerie saw us take notice and said, “As I mentioned on the phone, Hugh was unable to fully deal with the upkeep of this place given his advanced age. It’ll need to undergo renovations if you plan to sell. Some windows are cracked and will need to be weather-sealed. The kitchen appliances will need updating…”



It went on and on like that through what had to be *dozens* of rooms, and then we finally ended up at a set of stairs off the kitchen that led down to the basement. “Last but not least, the cellar,” Valerie said, and descended.



It ran the entire length of the estate. Bare lightbulbs dangled from the ceiling on thin chains, the walls seemed carved out of rock, and dozens of pieces of what was most likely furniture were draped in dingy sheets, covered with dust and cobwebs. 



“And top to bottom, that’s it!” Valerie crowed. Mom followed her to the stairs, their chatter growing faint as they headed back up to the kitchen, but I was frozen and my voice was caught in my throat. 



Something was staring at me from one of the darkest corners of the basement.



I grabbed my cell phone with a shaking hand and flipped on the flashlight. Swept it over stone walls once. Twice. *There.* 



A glassy pair of golden eyes glowed in the darkness. I opened my mouth to scream… and then let out a shaky laugh as adrenaline crashed through my system. *It was a teddy bear*. Stuffed into a pile of Hugh’s things and forgotten about for what looked like a century.



“Emma?” Mom called from upstairs. 



I turned to the stairs to go, but I couldn’t escape the feeling that the small, stuffed bear watched me as I pulled the chain on the lightbulb and left it in the darkness.



\*\*\*



That was it. We were done with the walkthrough, and mom and Valerie stood in the foyer hashing out the boring details. 



I found myself wandering through one of the estate’s many hallways. Halfway down, there was an old, yellowed sheet hanging over what looked like a mounted frame. There was nothing on any of the other walls. Just this one, large piece.



Curious, I reached out to lift the sheet when I heard the front door shut and my mom call out for me to help unload the truck. Valerie must have left.



So I let my hand drop and turned away. I got three steps before I heard the *swoosh* of fabric behind me.



Slowly, I turned back to find that the sheet had fallen from what I now saw was a large oil painting of a beautiful African-American woman in a long white dress. Lace sleeves covered the arms, and the neck was high. Old-fashioned, but probably of the time when the painting was done. It would’ve been a stunning portrait…



…If not for the *slashing cuts* in the canvas, right across the woman’s body. It was like someone attacked it with a butcher knife. 



I moved back toward the painting, drawn to it, my feet feeling like they were moving of their own accord. There was *something* about the woman. I couldn’t tear my eyes away.



I studied her face, feeling like the world was falling away…



And she *blinked.*

I'm noticing a pattern with her behavior, and as her big brother I want to help her, but I don't know what to do.

She has this habit of wanting to control things, and when things don't go her way, she tends to lament that, ""Nobody believes a single thing from me.""

She regularly asks me ""Why does nobody believe me?"" And if I answer ""Sister, of course we believe you."" Then she retorts that ""Well why don't we do this thing this way?"" Which the family generally responds that ""We know this ought to be done this way."" And the cycle continues.

Just recently, when we were about to get her things ready for school while she ate, she demanded that we not prepare, because she was having fun doing a guessing game. She then got frustrated and resorted to biting her fingers, saying ""I probably deserve this, ow ow ow"", of which I noticed was clearly her trying to get a rise out of us, and while she doesn't know she's doing it, is a form of emotional manipulation.

My response? I didn't validate when she said she was in pain, because she was doing it to herself. Instead I talked to her casually about how good my cup of coffee was.

She then asked why nobody believed her.

Obviously, she is trying to butter us up with biting herself, saying she deserves to inflict harm upon herself for ""being wrong"", and if she is validated and given what she wants, then she doesn't deserve biting herself and is happy.

See the problem?

I don't know how to dismantle this complex of manipulation she's built for herself. Whenever she is confronted on her behavior, she retreats behind the notion that she's just a little kid who knows nothing. Yet, if that's the case, why would we validate and listen to every thing she wants when it disrupts the necessary progress of the day, like school work?

I'd love some advice on how to go about this.",1,1740589053.0,raisingkids,2,1.0,False

Hope you're well. If not, maybe I can cheer you up? Otherwise, great! First things first, I'm a nerd who's looking for a fellow nerd, so if you aren't one, I'm afraid this might not work out. I'm looking for a partner in crime to share adventures with, both IRL and online. Bonus points if you want to rob a bank with me, fly to Bahamas, and 420 together on a tropical hotel beach resort. It'll be a blast!

Some info about me: I'm 33 yrs old and from Sweden, but ethnically Russo-Bengal. I'm 176 cm in height, black hair (tbh more like salt n' peppery), and kind brown eyes. On the heavier side because life really messed me up for a while, but I've lost a little bit and am working on myself both physically and mentally. That said I also have a lot of empathy for your own life struggles. Neurodivergent (very likely autistic, currently waiting for an evaluation), left leaning politically, a mix between a classic and modern man. A humanist and a romantic.

I'm looking to settle down with someone, I've always worn my heart on my sleeve. Gone above and beyond for everyone I've ever cared for, it'd be nice to have some reciprocity. I'm an introvert and a homebody but don't mind going out once in a while, whether it be for something grander or just a cozy coffee together. I get along best with clingy nerdy introverts, and if you're kind and into cute things I'm sure that'll help melt my heart =)

Some of my interests are:

- PC Gaming (WoW Anniversary/Classic/Retail, Overwatch 2, Risk of Rain 2, Civilization 6, Minecraft, Baldur's Gate 3, and plenty more. Let's find the next cool adventure together)

- Music (Daft Punk, Armin van Buuren, The Cure, Suicideboys, Kendrick Lamar, Pixies, Disarmonia Mundi, Modest Mouse, Provoker, and like a billion more)

- TV Shows (Mr. Robot, Battlestar Galactica, Mad Men, The Expanse, Venture Bros., Generation Kill, etc.)

- Movies (too many to list - where would I even start?)

- Anime (Code Geass, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, No Game No Life, Darker than Black, etc. etc. etc.)

- Shopping (anything nice really)

- Traveling (The Caribbean, Japan, Canary Isles, anywhere nice really, let's go somewhere together)

- Coding (Currently switching from a niche field to back-end, but I've always wanted to make a game with someone)


There's more to me than that, but perhaps we can save the rest for conversation. DMs open, so tell me a little bit about yourself and let's go from there. I prefer moving to a different app (guess which one is ideal for streaming movies and gaming?) if we hit it off. Cheers and have a nice day/evening!",1,1740588773.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Every **Monday**, we’re offering **FREE labor on simple car repairs**—you just cover the parts. No catch, no hidden fees, just a way to give back. **(Yes, really free.)**

# What We Can Fix in a Few Hours:

✅ Air & Cabin Filters  
✅ Brake Pads & Rotors  
✅ Battery Replacement  
✅ Spark Plugs (Most 4-Cylinder Cars)

# What We Don’t Do (Sorry!):

❌ Oil changes, diagnostics, major repairs  
❌ Custom mods, suspension, engine work  
❌ Cars older than 2010 or fancy European exotics (looking at you, BMW & Audi folks 😅)

# How It Works:

* **Drop your car off between 8-10 AM** (no waiting around needed).
* We’ll text you a **parts cost breakdown** (e.g., “New brakes: $40”).
* **Reply ""OK"" to confirm** & pick up your car between 3-5 PM.
* You pay for parts only. Labor? On the house.

# The Fine Print (Because There’s Always Fine Print):

🔹 Must live in **96001, 96002, or 96003** (bring proof of address).  
🔹 Car must be **2010 or newer & roadworthy** (no tow-ins).  
🔹 **Only 5 cars per Monday** – first come, first served.  
🔹 **Each car gets ONE free repair session** – share the love!

I just wanted to air and discuss something I’ve thought about a lot. How do you feel about something you crafted being an acceptable gift unasked for? 
Let me explain. I bake a lot, I also craft a lot, I just recently started embroidery too and my question is - is something crafted an acceptable gift if it’s not asked for? 
Say you’re invited home to someone for dinner, normally we grab a bottle of wine or a box of chocolate - but would it be acceptable or would it be seen as cheap to instead bring a batch of biscotti or a sourdough bread or a handmade candle, embroidered serviettes? 

My grandmas birthday is coming up and we live a bit far and have hade very much going on in our lives but we text and think of each other often but we don’t necessarily meet for birthdays and give presents. This year things has calmed down some and I plan a surprise visit on her birthday. Would it be looked at as cheap to give her a embroidered hoop and a sourdough bread for her birthday - as well as bringing cookies for coffee? 

How do you feel/do. Do you give homemade gifts and to whom is it acceptable? 

Me myself would love to get a nice loaf of sourdough bread in a beautifully embroidered towel or something like that. I don’t need flowers that die or a bottle of wine.

She likes coffee in the morning. Black, but if you pick it up from somewhere pour out a half inch and put water in to cool it down.

She loves deep conversations. Let her ramble for hours, you'll learn a lot and you'll also be captivated by her mind. She's really smart, and thinks so deeply about the smallest things; it's amazing.

She loves small and large gestures, but most of all she loves things with thought. Listen to her, take notes. She deserves it.

She puts on a tough face to the world, but she's sensitive. She cares a lot, she's been through a lot; handle her with care.

She loves deeply and unconditionally, reciprocate that.. it's all she truly wants.

Don't lie to her, at all; about anything.
She's the most understanding person I've ever met and my mistake was lying repeatedly because I was scared to lose her. Don't do that to her.

She has nightmares so when she jolts awake, rub her arms or back and hold her tighter and tell her it's okay.

She loves music. Let her be the DJ when you drive, I promise you'll find so many good songs.

She loves deeply. Deeper than anyone else I've ever known. Handle that with care, and love her back. Actually.. double it. Whatever she gives, however she loves you; double it because she deserves it.

She has a lot of trauma from the past, sit with her and listen. Understand it, dissect it. So you can love her appropriately.

The most important thing.. 
Make her happy. Her smile is.. sunshine. Her thoughtfulness, the most important gift you'll ever receive. I've cried in her arms after I did her wrong.. and she held me and told me it was okay. She's truly the most amazing person you will ever meet. 

So, if you get the chance to love her. Don't be me. You can love her from the deepest crevices you have, with every fiber in your body; just like I did. However, if you lie like I did and cheat like I did at the very beginning of it all , she'll leave. Don't lose her. You will regret it for the rest of your life. 

I know I deserve this, I know my actions led to this and I accept it. It hurts worse than anything I've ever felt, but I deserve it. 

Give her the love she needs, make her happy. She deserves the entire world, the stars, the suns; all of it. Please, make her happy and give her the love she needs. She deserves it so deeply.

Liquid IV contains 380mg of potassium and the protein shake has anywhere from 150-310mg depending on the flavor. Both of these together equal about 12-14% of the recommended daily intake. I didn't realize I would need to avoid potassium and I just don't know how strict I really need to be. Would I be okay to continue drinking the protein shake AND a Liquid IV packet every day??

Over the 5+ years I spent at the company, the executive leadership changed 4 times. While the previous leaders had their own style of leadership, they were all competent and encouraged a healthy work environment for the accounting team. 

The current leadership on the other hand have an ethically questionable previous track record and started changing a lot of things since they started. This includes pressuring the accounting teams to deliver an unjustifiably fast close (4 day close when we could barely close in 8 days), creating confusion and chaos in the accounting teams by intentionally vague job duties, ever changing goals, forcing the teams to work through personal and medical emergencies and shouting, yelling and threatening to fire anybody who could not. This was raised to the HR by many members in upper management (me included) but to no resolution / action. After trying to hold it all together for almost a year with the hope that the chaos will eventually subside, I finally came to terms with the fact that things were not going to change and resigned. 

Over my 5 years, I had developed a cordial working relationship with some members on the audit team who would invite me to lunch or coffee quarterly. (My understanding is this is something auditors do to maintain relationships with their clients). As the audit team is now finding out that I no longer work there, the Senior Manager reached out to express that they would miss me and asked if I would be willing to catch up. I am not sure what my ethical responsibilities / obligations are in this situation. Since I don't work for the employer anymore. 

Is it a wise idea to still meet up? Ideally, I would like to maintain the professional relationship for networking purposes but want to be cautious. What are some things to be mindful of?  ",11,1740587548.0,Accounting,11,1.0,False

1iyrlly,https://www.reddit.com/r/Binah_LoR/comments/1iyrlly/corporate_colors_short_story/,Corporate Colors (Short Story),"It had been well over a year since both Kali and Garion awoke in the strange land of New York City. After their fight within the old facility in the outskirts concluded with their deaths, they simply awoke in one of the many back alleyways that NYC had to offer, as if they were dreaming for far too long... Yet, it was not merely a dream. Kali and Garion's clothes were still drenched with blood, and where their body had been damaged, only scars remained.

Since they had awoken in this new, strange land seemingly without their augmentations, they sorted out their differences and began taking any job that they could get their hands on, once they had proper identification of course. However, there was an exception, and that was this; to avoid serving customers in person as much as possible.

Naturally, the two of them questioned such an idea initially. I mean, sure, their co-workers at the office were spooked by them, and their roommate feared them when they became disgruntled, but what was the big deal? They've improved their temper and their ability to show restraint by a massive degree, so what was the problem with customer service?

To the world's dismay, Kali and Garion were now finding out.

The office they previously worked at had brought out a massive wave of lay-offs, and even though the arbiter and fixer were the two most productive employees in their building, they were on that list. Infuriating, I know, but now... the only job they could find with a similar wage was... Subway.

They had only been working there for three weeks, and already they looked as though they were going to erupt in a fiery inferno of rage. They kept their composure, smiling towards the customers that they legally had to respect and treat fairly, but the redness in Kali's face, and the overall menacing aura emitting from Garion was proof that they were not happy at all. Not only that, but their strength from their previous lives was beginning to very slowly return, and they hadn't noticed that they'd been partially crumpling anything they grasped... regardless of material.

Of course, most customers, new or old, didn't notice the fury welling within the duo. Their coworkers did, and whenever either the former arbiter or former fixer simply glanced their way, their skin became a deathly pale. A few children that walked into the americanized subway sandwich store made sure to keep their distance, but things seemed perfectly normal if you didn't look too closely.

However, things were about to change.

""That's a foot-long BLT with a medium soft drink and a chocolate chip cookie for your order, will that be all sir?"" Garion said through a false smile. ""Yes, thank you."" ""Alright, I'll have your meal ready shortly!"" The arbiter said before turning around to grab another customer's sandwich from the oven. An oppressive veil of rage shrouded her face, and her co-workers were trying their best to pretend they didn't notice.

""Order for John?"" Kali called forth, signaling the completion of a customer's meal. She held up the order's receipt in a white-knuckled vice of wrath, and her facade of happiness was beginning to erode. Just then, a new customer entered. ""*Just great...""* Kali thought to herself. Whoever it was, if they were so much as slightly rude to her, she'd be willing to go to prison with what she'd do to them... but instead, it was someone she recognized. Her anger melted away instantly, and her smile became instead an expression of shock. Garion also recognized them, but only in passing.

It was Daniel, that blue-haired noble from the facility. He was wearing a barista's apron, as he seemed to be on lunch break. He cheerily waved to each customer as he entered, and then... his eyes met those two.

A shadow of dread washed over him momentarily, and he pretended not to recognize them. He was failing miserably at doing so, at least for the two most powerful women he's ever had the pleasure of meeting. There was no fooling them, but thankfully, they played along. *""They learn quick...""* He thought to himself. *""But even I can see that they are not having a good time...""* The realization then dawned on him. If they have just one bad day...

*""Yeah, not on my watch.""* He thought to himself. Putting on a brave face, he took his order, and afterwards, before Kali could turn an prepare his meal, he grabbed her attention. ""Meet me here after your shift ends."" Daniel said with a great deal of hushed urgency, slipping them a business card. It held the location of the brewery he worked at. ""Bring that arbiter with you... and try not to burn the building down.""

Kali gave the business card a once over, before shooting him an intimidating look, recognizing that he was offered coffee to the two women he feared the most. Daniel returned a nod, acknowledging her plight and stress.

Surprisingly, the duo managed to finish their shift without much incident... but now, they had a chance.

A chance to be themselves, behind closed doors.

A chance to let loose, if only for a moment.

And, more importantly, a chance to catch up with an old acquaintance.",2,1740587490.0,Binah_LoR,3,1.0,False
1iyrlg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1iyrlg1/could_big_berkey_water_filter_really_be_the_best/,Could Big Berkey water filter really be the best option? Read this review to find out!,"Testing the Big Berkey Gravity-Fed Stainless Steel Countertop Water Filter System with its 2.25-gallon capacity has been quite the journey. The sleek stainless steel build immediately fits well into the kitchen aesthetic, and its gravity-fed mechanism offers a hassle-free, electricity-free operation. After using it daily for weeks, I have some thoughts—both positive and critical—that might help you decide whether this countertop water filter meets your needs.

**Features**

The Big Berkey system is equipped with two Black Berkey Elements, which are the heart of its filtration power. These filters remove over 250 contaminants, including chlorine, heavy metals, bacteria, and even emerging issues like microplastics. The lack of need for electricity or installation tools makes it an ideal solution for both urban households and off-grid scenarios. I particularly appreciated its portability; moving it around was as simple as relocating a coffee maker.

The filter’s stainless steel finish not only looks premium but also adds durability. It holds up to daily use without showing wear and tear. The system also includes a spigot for easy access, though it’s made of plastic, which I’ll touch on later.

[Click here to see the price](https://usedwater.com/price/b00cyw3evo/).

**Ease of Installation & Use**

Setting it up was straightforward—at least, mostly. Attaching the filters required priming, which can be a bit tedious if your faucet doesn’t perfectly fit the priming button. I ended up improvising with a rubber band to ensure it stayed snugly in place. Once primed, though, the rest of the assembly was a breeze. Pour water into the upper chamber, let gravity do its work, and you’re rewarded with clean, refreshing water in the lower chamber.

Daily use is simple: lift the lid, refill the upper compartment, and let it filter down. It’s quiet, unobtrusive, and doesn’t require constant monitoring. However, I would recommend getting a stand to elevate the unit, especially if your sink isn’t nearby; it makes dispensing water much more convenient.

**Filtration Technology & Effectiveness**

The Black Berkey Elements are truly impressive. They’re designed to filter out a long list of harmful substances, including lead and arsenic. I tested it with tap water that often has a slight chlorine odor, and the difference was night and day. The water tasted clean—almost too pure, as though I was drinking bottled water directly from a pristine spring.

One of the standout aspects is its ability to remove ""forever chemicals,"" which are notoriously hard to filter. This fact alone gave me peace of mind, especially knowing my family is drinking safe water free of contaminants. However, I did notice a slight mineral deposit buildup in my teapot, which could be due to the system retaining beneficial minerals while filtering out harmful substances.

**Filter Lifespan & Replacement**

Here’s where the Big Berkey really shines. Each pair of Black Berkey Elements lasts up to 6,000 gallons, which translates to years of use for an average household. Even with heavy use, these filters are cost-effective in the long run. Although replacement filters are on the pricey side, the longevity makes it worth the investment.

Cleaning the filters periodically is essential to maintain flow rate and filtration quality. It’s a simple process involving scrubbing with a Scotch-Brite pad under running water. I’ve had no issues with clogging, even after weeks of use.

**Flow Rate & Performance**

The filtration speed is reasonable, with a maximum flow rate of about 0.03 gallons per minute. For everyday use, it’s sufficient, but if you have a larger family or frequently entertain guests, you might want to consider doubling the filters to increase the flow rate. I ended up installing two additional Black Berkey Elements, and the difference was noticeable.

**Certifications**

The Black Berkey Elements are backed by independent lab testing, which adds to their credibility. They meet rigorous water purification standards, removing pathogens and heavy metals to a high degree. This level of trust is critical when investing in a water filtration system.

**Capacity & Suitability**

The 2.25-gallon capacity is perfect for a family of four, but it might feel excessive for a single person. However, for my household, it was just the right size. We use it for drinking water, cooking, and even filling up water bottles for outings. On busier days, I found myself refilling it twice, which wasn’t much of an inconvenience.

**Warranty**

The product comes with a six-month warranty for materials and workmanship, while the Black Berkey Elements have a prorated two-year warranty. While this coverage is decent, it would be reassuring to see a longer warranty period for such a significant investment.

**Advantages**

* Filters over 250 contaminants, including harmful bacteria and heavy metals.
* Long-lasting Black Berkey Elements save money in the long run.
* No need for electricity or complicated installation.
* Water tastes exceptionally clean and refreshing.
* Portable and ideal for both home use and emergencies.

**Shortcomings**

* Initial filter priming can be tricky without the right faucet adapter.
* Plastic spigot feels less durable compared to the stainless steel body.
* Filtration speed might be slow for larger households without extra filters.

**Competing Products**

Compared to similar gravity-fed systems like the Alexapure Pro or AquaRain filters, the Big Berkey stands out for its extensive list of contaminants it can handle. While the Alexapure Pro offers comparable filtration, it doesn’t boast the same long-lasting filter life. On the other hand, systems like Brita are more affordable but don’t come close to removing the same range of impurities. If you’re looking for serious filtration with longevity, the Big Berkey has a clear edge.

**Affordable Quality**

In terms of cost efficiency, the Big Berkey is an upfront investment that pays for itself over time. While other systems might be cheaper initially, frequent filter replacements and limited capabilities can make them more expensive in the long run. For anyone serious about water quality, this filter delivers excellent value for its price.

1iyrlal,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1iyrlal/im_in_love_with_my_highschool_sweetheart_how/,I'm in love with my highschool sweetheart. How should I go about it?,"I'm new to reddit, so some please give me grace.

  Context (it's long): In high school we were both dating someone else but there was hints at romance between us. We would always play wrestle, hold hands, talk for long hours, and touch each other intimately but not sexual. We ended up breaking up with our partners in highschool but never pursued a relationship before we graduated. So After highschool he went to the army, once he came back he made an effort to get in touch with me. He started by finding my brother on social media and talking through him to find me. Once he found me, we ended up meeting up. We stayed up all night till 5 am talking, reconnecting. During that talk I found out about his highschool relationship and he told me that break up really affected him and he's not looking for a relationship but he's open to it. I told him I understand but I was. He told me ""well let's see how it goes and if feelings ever arise."" During that time we wouldn't stop going out together, we were always going somewhere at least 2-3 a week. I admit he started getting handsy: asking for kisses, touching my boobs and butt and started to talk sexual. I let him in attempt to be with him but I started to feel uncomfortable. So one day I told him I felt like I was being used and I wanted us to slow down if you're not ready for a relationship because I AM. He understood until the end of the movie when he flashed his banana at me!! I was shocked and knew if this kept on I would sleep with him just to make him love me. So I ended the day early and went home. I didn't talk with him for two years. All that time he kept talking to my brother, sending me texts now stop just asking me how was my day or sending me funny videos to get me to reply or something. I thought giving us space would get me time to maybe get over him or maybe give him time to heal and understand what he wanted.

After those two years, I decided to contact him. He wasted no time and started slow. I felt like he really did learn and change. So we met up for coffee and he immediately apologized. The first thing he literally did, my jaw was on the floor and he told me, in highschool he really liked me and he was acting like a fool when we reconnected and he never wanted me to feel like that again, that he really cares for me. I admit that sent me butterflies and it really relaxed me. So we started hanging out again 2-3 times a week. Until I found out he was dating someone else through Instagram stories using context clues. It hurt but I should've expected it for not talking with the man for 2 years. So I slowed down and instead of every 2-3 weeks. It was once every 3 weeks. Until December of 2024.

He asked me to spend the new year's with him just us for 3 days. I asked him what about his girl and he told me ""he'd rather spend time with someone who wants him"" he told me that they were no longer together. So yes I said sure. During those 3 days he took me out, we saw the lights and took me to a really expensive dinner date. He was really making this romantic, thinking he was actually pursuing me. And that night I fumbled and ended up sleeping with him I thought it was over but no he started seeing me more and not just in the bed. Whenever we go out he started to do PDA, it was like we were dating. He even asked me if we can do a double date with his friend. The first time he asked for a date, I felt like this was the closest we ever gotten to dating. Until I opened my big mouth and poof! I got crowbared to the fucking knees with reality. I noticed he was really experienced in bed, so I asked him how many people he slept with? Ok, Less than 20 in 7 years? no big deal. the deal was the way he went about it. Apparently he's been using Reddit to sleep with randoms and even the wives of husbands in front of them. When he explained it, it was like it was fun to him and would still do it if given the chance. It was his past I can't judge him but now that would be in the back of my mind from here on out.

Once the end of January and early February hit, he wasted no time and  told me they were selling tickets to dream Con! He asked me can I buy a ticket and let's go together. He was so excited and I agreed wanting to always go. So As soon as I bought the ticket. He told me ""he never done this with anyone and that's why I'm special and he truly enjoys spending time with me and not just the sex."" Then he asked me to spend Valentine's with. I told him yes but I noticed. The way he pursued me wasn't the same from December. It was like 4 of the days of the week all eyes on me but 3 of those days couldn't be bothered to send me one text.  So Valentine's Day touchdowned and I get him flowers, personally pick them out and made him homemade fudge and creme brulee. We agreed to meet for 10am to spend all day together but he didn't show till 1pm and didn't get me anything. he apologized and we just ordered food in and spent time together. I don't care what we do but as long as you put effort and energy into me I would love it. I didn't feel that energy so I asked him if he was alright and asked him if he was getting under me to get over someone else. He assured me no and he values me and I mean a lot to him, if he just wanted to sleep with someone he would've gone on Reddit. But he truly loves being with me and it makes him comfortable.

Onto Now (if you're still here you deserve a cookie!!): a couple of days ago we met and he straight up asked me if I loved him. He told me when I asked him if he was using me to get over an ex, it got him thinking. Well it surprised me and took me off guard do I told him: I really did and I needed those two years away for both of us to figure out what we wanted. But right now I'm scared, I'm really scared of loving him and being vulnerable because I don't know his intentions are. But now I regret saying that I should've been truthful and say I've been madly in love with you for 12 years!! It's just been replaying in my head, why would he ask that?! If he wasn't ready why bring it up? Now all these feelings are flooding up and I don't know how I can just be friends with him? We're meeting up in 2 days. Should I just tell him? But if he says no then we just can't be friends? I don't want to make this ackward especially when we played and payed for dream con that's happening a couple of months away. What should I do? I see him in 2 days and my mind won't stop racing! Why would he ask me that?! Please help, thank you. (Here's your cookies guys 🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪)",0,1740587470.0,WhatShouldIDo,2,0.5,False

Let's get straight to the point hahah 

I've been having a hard time lately after my break from coffee. Whenever I brew even if it's the same bag that I used to buy at my local specialty roastery thru  online.. I always get an over/under-extracted brew. Before taking a break, I knew I was doing well in channeling, pouring, and tasting. When I say I'm doing well, it means there are more good or clear layered cups that I brew than having an astringency or dull, etc.. 

I've tried a lot of things, especially new recipes.. But lately, every brew is always under/over-extracted. In most coffee enthusiasts, they always say "" Know your beans first "" and I always watch them brewing it once and the result is either very clear and layered, or sometimes it's just a good cup in which you can taste some notes ( enough to enjoy the cup ). 

My question is.. How will you know what kind of brewing method, grind size, temp, etc. you should use  just by knowing your coffee beans. what should I look for ?

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I’ve been wanting to move for about 3 years now so I’ve done a lot of research about the deadlines for registering with a commune or for health insurance and all the paperwork we’ll need to get from the SF consulate as we’re both registered with them. It feels like I’m missing something about the plans though, possibly because I’ve thought about and imagined this for so long but haven’t made the concrete plans yet, kinda planning a vacation but you’re in limbo because it’s too far to know the weather and pack but too close to not worry about it. 

We have bachelor degrees and a few years of work experience, me as a legal assistant for the gov’t (another reason to go, I know), him as an aerospace engineer for a big company. Both of the places we work have a good amount of name recognition in our fields, especially his. We both speak an official language natively, him Swiss-German and me French and we’re in the process of learning French and High German respectively. I want to aim for getting a B1 certification before I go through lingoda and then taking Swiss German classes there, while my boyfriend has taken a few official French classes a few years ago and we both do Duolingo everyday and seek out/share with each other social media in each language to help with practical use and comprehension. 

He turns 25 in January, and would like to avoid mandatory military service if he can help it which is why we’re not planning on going until winter. I have an uncle who works high up in my field who could help me figure out the layout of things, and we also have relatives in finance and insurance who could help us find a bank that would allow us to open accounts or what health insurance is best for us. On the US side, I have a brother who will be staying in the states who’s address I could use, if my parents also move back, for anything needing a US address, and I do trust him to not share any of the information he may get through that. 

Savings wise, I have almost 60k now as does he, and I plan to be at about 70-75k when we go. Zurich is most likely where we’ll end up which is quite expensive, although we live in Seattle and when we’ve been traveling to Copenhagen or London, cities they call extremely expensive, the prices for many things have been very comparable so we won’t be getting too much sticker shock at the grocery store or for everyday goods. I can also rely on some family support when it comes to initial moving costs. 

Socially is where it gets complicated, my household was arguable more Swiss growing up as my dad was also half Swiss, and we moved to Bern for a year when I was 7 and attended school there so I won’t stick out as much, but as adults we won’t be having a great social network beyond a few cousins our age and some of my old schools friends when we go. He’s never spent more than a month or two at a time there but is quite social, while I’m much more of the classic reserved German “no small talk” stereotype. I know making friends will be hard, but we both ski and do outdoorsy activities and crafts so I imagine we’ll be able to find some clubs and start from there, at least to find one or two people we can get coffee with or something. I don’t have much of a community here besides my parents, and his friends and family are already spread across the US anyway so he’s used to being far from them. 

Sorry it’s so long, but is there anything obvious I’m missing in the plan here? Or anything that I should be thinking more about or less? Thanks!",1,1740587109.0,AmerExit,0,1.0,False

What are your thoughts?","So I’m currently in a very dark head space of the uncertainty of what I have. I’m mostly scared of the possibility of ALS (MND) and the thought of having it is literarily consuming me tbh. I’m just hoping maybe someone has symptoms like mine and has something else. 
For context I’m 26, and around 4 years ago I started noticing my legs were getting more tired than usual. Usually in the shower. Thought it was strange but continued on. Then as the months went by i noticed the same with my arms, and hands, and even my core. That my muscles just seemed so much weaker. Holding a coffee cup for instance was may more strenuous than before. I then and still do get random numbness that is widespread that disappears within a few hours. My legs would feel like I had weights tied down them. & some days it felt like I was glued to the bed. I stayed the same for a while and I’d say I had mid progress with continued weakness. Fast forward I am weaker in all of my muscle group. However I can still walk, and do my tasks just they are much much harder. It is a struggle to climb stairs my muscles in thigh and calves start to burn and start to shake  & using even just my arms and hands my muscles are just so weak and they start to shake as well. I’ve experienced fasciculations as well pretty often & some random jerking movements every now and again. I was reading some CIPD stories that seemed like we share a lot of the same symptoms in the sense of weakness and what not but I don’t have any of the tingling, burning pains in the feet and hands like many have so I scratch that off my list in my head, same with MG… share many symptoms however my eyelids and face aren’t affected which is a main hallmark symptom.. I always get close to hoping that something just matches up so that way I can feel some hope and not doomed that it’s ALS.  I just feel like I share much more symptoms with it. & many may think well it’s been 4 years you’d be severely immobile  by now or passed away possibly but from my understanding younger people tend to progress much much slower. it just makes me truly sick to my stomach. MRI of head was clear, I TRULY thought it was MS….. I have a neurologist appt soon.

1iyrdf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1iyrdf2/i_think_my_friend_is_ghosting_me/,I think my friend is ghosting me?,"I have a friend we'll call Matt. Matt and I initially met at work and became close friends. He's a bit sheltered due to his upbringing but a really fun goofy guy. Due to his upbringing he has spent a lot of time with his older brother, who we'll call Donny, and Donny's long term girlfriend, who we'll call Ellen. Matt sees Donny and Ellen as his closest friends and they do practically everything together.

A few years ago, when we were short staffed at work, Matt brought in Ellen who was in need of a job, and she worked with us for about a year. During that time I began hanging out with both Matt and Ellen frequently, both at work and outside of it, and we developed close friendships. We also used to hang out with Donny as well, and had a lot of fun.

Ellen quit our job about 1,5 years ago and Matt quit a few months ago. We've kept in touch in spite of not seeing each other daily at work and I considered both of these friendships as strong. Until a few months ago, that is.

Matt had a big birthday coming up and I tried to get a hold of Ellen to plan a surprise party. Except Ellen wouldn't answer me. I tried to get a hold of her but she seemingly ignored me. I then tried to sneakily get some information from Matt about any birthday plans - and found out both Ellen and Donny would be on a two weeks vacation during the time and they were paying him to housesit. No celebrations mentioned. I thought this was odd, so I gathered up a bunch of people from work who knew him well and threw him a surprise dinner, which he was very happy about. As we were gathering up to leave afterwards, he mentioned it was sad Ellen and Donny didn't know about it so they could join. I then told him the truth, that I had initially tried to reach Ellen to plan something but that she wasn't answering me. He looked confused and asked if I had tried to contact her recently, and that since they were away, maybe that was the problem. I told him I had started trying to reach her about this one and a half month before his birthday and several times leading up to it. I showed him the timestamps on my phone. He seemed a little upset so I told him it's probably nothing to worry about, because I didn't want to ruin the celebration.

We all parted ways and since then Matt and I have made plans to hang out again - and I have tried to reach out to Ellen again. This time I just wrote a simple ""hey, wanna hang out someday soon, maybe go for coffee?"" - just something simple, easy and without any guilting or making big plans. Anything to make sure she isn't overwhelmed. But still no answer.

I get that I'm being ghosted. I don't understand why. I also don't understand how she's comfortably ghosting someone who's a shared friend of her brother-in-law; that's a connection that at least for me would feel really weird if the roles were reversed. Matt claims to have heard nothing bad about me or that she doesn't want to hear from me, but the silence is deafening and it's coming up on three months soon. Is this where I give up on her? I keep overthinking it all and feel like maybe I'm missing something; a piece that would show me the whole picture and give me the answers I seek. But I also realistically know she's most likely ghosting me and that I'll most likely never know why. Any advice for me? I feel lost.",1,1740586942.0,ghosting,1,1.0,False

Recently, I noticed some difference on my usual shot.

(Same beans, this started around a month ago)

I have to grind a lot coarser than usual grind setting, otherwise it would not pull a drop.

After I changed my grind setting, whenever I pull a shot, I can see the water remains on the basket. Watery puck.

Coffee taste fine though.

When I went coarser to avoid water puck, then I had crazy channeling and sprays. So I had to set the grind setting at a certain point.

Yesterday, I ran descaling.

After that, this morning,

When I press 1-shot button, the amount of water came out, first picture. Almost 1 cup.

When I press 2-shot button, the amount of water is much less than 1-shot button...

I usually press 2-shot button and hold for making espresso.

It feels like the pressure of the machine got weakened? I don't know how to explain.",1,1740586547.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
