1h32rvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/9Barista/comments/1h32rvz/induction_or_electric_cooktop/,Induction or Electric Cooktop? | Standardized/Benchmark Metrics for Dialing In?,"Hi All,

I have just purchased the 9Barista, and wanted to gauge if the community has established benchmark metrics as far as the heat source is concerned. While I understand that grind size and coffee amount affect the brew, it seems to me that the heat source would be highly important as well. Considering this, I read on the induction plate product page on 9Barista's website that it should be heated at no more than 600W. However, this does not state the recommended wattage or temperature through the brew process. Since induction cooktops use power (watts) AND temperature, while with electric cooktops one can adjust only one variable, it seems that induction could provide a more precisely repeatable dial in. I will note I drink medium-roast espresso.

While it seems many are brewing beautiful shots 'feeling' their way to the proper dial in with whatever stovetop they may have, I am curious if any have standardized an optimal electric or induction workflow, and if any have recommendations as to which I should choose. I will conclude that I would prefer a cooktop that is portable, as this is one of the benefits of the machine! Thanks in advance to all!",1,1732934907.0,9Barista,0,1.0,False

1h32rfa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h32rfa,Man why y’all feel the need to do this,"To the person who rejected my trade and sent me a “😂”, this is for you. It’s incredibly infuriating when someone dismisses my genuine trade offer on Soundmap with a mocking ""😂"" emoji. Do you think it's funny? I hope your crayons melt in the sun, and your favorite pair of socks gets a hole in the toe.
Trading on Soundmap takes effort, thought, and a bit of trust. When I take the time to craft an offer, only to receive your smug little laugh, it’s like spitting in my face. I hope every time you eat cereal, your milk is just a little too warm, and your toast always lands butter-side down.
I don't just throw out offers willy-nilly. I consider value, fairness, and what you might actually want. Your ""😂"" tells me that my effort wasn't even worth a moment's serious consideration. May your pencils always break when you're writing something important, and may your favorite TV shows always buffer at the worst moments.
Why not just decline politely? Or better yet, offer a counterproposal? Instead, you chose to be dismissive and condescending. I hope your Wi-Fi cuts out right when you’re about to win an online game, and that you step on a Lego every morning.
A respectful decline or a constructive comment would be far better. But no, you had to send a ""😂"". May all your pens run out of ink halfway through writing, and may your phone battery die just as you need it most.
The level of disrespect you’ve shown with that emoji is staggering. It’s not just a simple rejection; it’s a mockery of my time and effort. I hope every meal you eat is just slightly overcooked, and that every drink you take is lukewarm. I hope your umbrella always flips inside out when it rains, and that your shoelaces snap when you're in a hurry.
You might think that sending a ""😂"" emoji is harmless, but it's a direct insult to the effort I've put in. It’s a way of saying that my offer, my time, and my thoughts are worth nothing to you. May your car always have a mysterious rattle that no mechanic can fix, and may you always get stuck in the slowest checkout line at the grocery store.
There’s a certain level of courtesy expected in any negotiation, whether it’s in person or online. Your ""😂"" emoji breaks that unspoken rule of decency. I hope every sweater you own shrinks in the wash, and that you always have a hangnail. May your favorite book always have the last page missing, and your phone screen always have a smudge that won’t come off.
When I see that ""😂"" emoji, it feels like a slap in the face. It’s a signal that my offer wasn’t even worth considering, let alone responding to politely. I hope every movie you watch has a crucial scene spoiled beforehand, and that your shoes always give you blisters. May your pillows always be too lumpy, and your alarm clock fail to go off when you need it most.
Trading on Soundmap should be a respectful exchange, but your reaction makes it clear that you don’t value that principle. I hope your internet connection is always just a little too slow for streaming, and that your glasses are always smudged. May every pen you use explode in your pocket, and your favorite shirt always get stained.
It’s not just about the rejection; it’s about the way you’ve chosen to deliver it. That ""😂"" emoji is a form of ridicule that undermines the entire purpose of the platform. I hope your favorite mug always has coffee drips down the side, and that your headphones always have one side that doesn’t work. May your most important emails always go to spam, and your favorite songs always skip.
I wish people on Soundmap could be more considerate and respectful. A simple ""no, thank you"" or a counteroffer would go a long way. Instead, you chose mockery. I hope your mail always gets lost, and your favorite restaurant always has a long wait. May your phone always die right when you need to make an important call, and your computer always crash when you haven’t saved your work.
That ""😂"" emoji isn’t just a laugh; it’s a statement of disdain. It’s a way of saying that my effort is laughable to you. I hope your shoes always squeak, and that your keys always get stuck in the lock. May your favorite TV shows always be on hiatus, and your candles always burn unevenly.
If you think that sending a ""😂"" emoji is a harmless joke, think again. It’s a direct insult to the effort and thought I put into my offer. I hope your ice cream always melts before you can enjoy it, and that your popcorn is always burned. May your favorite pen always be missing, and your light bulbs always flicker.
The dismissive nature of that emoji is what makes it so infuriating. It’s not just a rejection; it’s a mockery of my attempt to engage in a fair trade. I hope your shoelaces always come untied, and that your coffee is always too hot. May your car always be low on gas, and your favorite chair always be uncomfortable.
In a community like Soundmap, mutual respect is key. Your ""😂"" emoji shows a lack of that respect. I hope your favorite team always loses, and that your plants always wilt. May your headphones always tangle, and your favorite show always be spoiled.
That ""😂"" emoji is more than just a laugh; it’s a symbol of your disdain for my effort. I hope your showers are always cold, and that your socks never match. May your favorite book always be out of stock, and your favorite movie always be sold out.
To sum it up, your ""😂"" emoji is a slap in the face to anyone who puts genuine effort into a trade offer. It reflects poorly on you and creates a hostile trading environment. I hope your printer always jams, and your keys always get lost. A little decency and respect can go a long way, but it seems you have none to spare. Sleep with one eye open.

Fuck you if you do this. There is NO reason to say it’s free and then immediately respond “😂” I AM NOT FUCKING LAUGHING blehhh",1,1732934862.0,Soundmap,0,1.0,False

And I’ve looked through some posts on why people don’t/ do like them.  I guess I wanted to talk about why I DO like it.  Like some people stated, it does seem like espresso hates madeleine due to the way the interact.  However, I feel like the English translation isn’t very accurate.  In the KR dub, it doesn’t really sound like espresso dislikes him.  You’d think they’re friends.  I’m not very fluent in Korean but from what I understand, it sounds more like “teasing” in a way?  Madeleine seems like that one annoying friend you like.  And they’ve both had some pretty major character development because of eachother.  Like I saw someone say, they bring out the best in eachother.  The odyssey was pretty huge for them.  Honestly seeing espresso laugh in such a genuine way was really nice.  And the sort of motivational speech he gave to madeleine was ALSO really nice.  And madeleine cookie who knows espresso so well, describing his features perfectly.  I know most of their interactions out of the game probably aren’t canon, but it’s cute.  Definetly take a look at their CN interactions if you’re interested!  
(*They even held hands in a cn collab!  Though it may have been for the script)
Also IM pretty sure this was in Chinese but it was from a few years ago, but madeleine cookie called them a match made it heaven.  Though he was probably talking about their “friendship” Espresso also implied he’s made coffee for madeleine 

English isn’t my first language I’m more of a Spanish speaker but if you disagree, feel free to lmk!  I’d really like to see people’s thoughts on them.😄",3,1732934513.0,CookieRunKingdoms,1,1.0,False

my mom had been tu* and had d* this past week, but she thought it was from food poisoning so i wasn’t that worried about it. i was going in & out of her room to take care of her, and we shared some popcorn at the movies last night so i’m wondering if i actually caught something from her.

however, today, i had iced coffee this morning and taco bell a few hours later so that might have been a deadly combo, or maybe i had overeaten/ate too quickly. 

it happened about an hour ago. after i ate felt super full. and then about 30 minutes before it happened, i was n*, my hands and feet were cold & clammy, i had stomach cramps, and had some acid reflux that was coming up and going down. then it just happened suddenly when i was in bed. (luckily i had my trash can right next to me just in case) it wasn’t that bad in the moment because i didn’t have time to react. in fact, i felt a lot better after!! but now i’m starting to feel s* again (though not as bad as before) and i really don’t want to happen again. i still don’t know if my mom & i have a bug or something, or if it happening was just a coincidence.

i know i’ll probably be okay if it happens again, but i really hate this feeling :(

edit: it happened again almost immediately after i posted this lol. a lot more came out the second time. i feel better now but i would like to be done with this ugh",1,1732934199.0,emetophobia,1,1.0,False

A bit of coffee had dripped on the small heating element of their coffee mate percolator. He went to wipe it down, but the ire and rage that emanated from his scrubbing was palpable. His wife tried to calm him down by saying, “We just have to make sure to clean up the drips, it’s no big deal!” I could tell he was trying to be cool about it, but he muttered “it still gets stained no matter what I do”. It’s one of those little things in life that relentlessly irritates him. I can absolutely relate to those irrational details that drive you mad. 

I’ve been trying to come up with a solution, and was thinking that a layer of silicone, whether a mat cut to size or a coating of sealant, might solve the problem. Am I on the right track?

1h32hrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Albuquerque/comments/1h32hrt/mcdonalds_and_numale_cases_compared_and_contrasted/,McDonalds and NuMale cases compared and contrasted,"In 1992, 79-year-old Stella Liebeck went through the drive-through at the McDonalds on Gibson and boiling hot coffee spilled on her lap and sent her to the hospital for eight days, skin grafts, plus two years of follow up.

McDonalds wouldn’t pay the $20k in medical bills, so they got sued in federal court.

In 1994, the jury verdict heard round the world: $160k plus $2.7M in punitive damages. It was later reduced to $640k, and then it got confidentially settled.

Roughly double all those dollar amounts to reach 2024 equivalents. This case is still required reading at any competent law school.


From the Southeast to the Northeast. In 2017, at the NuMale clinic at Paseo and Wyoming, M.S., a 66-year-old widower from Rio Rancho, went for testosterone replacement therapy because he had low energy and wanted to lose weight.

This clinic did not take most insurance, and was run a lot more like a used car dealership than an endocrinology clinic. I know because I’ve received services there. They gave him testosterone pellets implanted in the butt cheek (I had that done there too) but upsold him on penile injections he didn’t want or ask for.

It’s rather appalling what happened next, totally not his fault, and somewhat beyond what my worst nightmares would have been with such a procedure, but when it was all over, they ended up destroying his penis and he lost all feeling and functionality there. He sued in 2020.

The Albuquerque jury just found in favor of Mr. M.S. and set a world record medical malpractice judgment against NuMale: $37M in compensatory damages and $375M in punitive damages, give or take a few dollars.

This is over 100x what Ms. Liebeck was awarded. NuMale is a multi state chain of clinics, but McDonalds.. yeah.

Naturally, this case will likewise probably make it into law school required reading as well, at least until something bigger comes along.

I don’t know that it really impacts the goings on in Albuquerque, but it happened here and not anywhere else. What does everybody think?",10,1732933962.0,Albuquerque,6,0.92,False

In those 4 years I’ve had about four brief, failed talking stages, which discouraged me so bad I deleted dating apps altogether. For the past year, I’ve met nobody because I work with all adults and do not get approached at bars, coffee shops, or anywhere with people my age. I don’t consider myself ugly at all, but I am extremely shy and a bit guarded. 

Today I was eating lunch with my mom and an extremely handsome (borderline majestic) guy and his friend sat in the booth next to ours. My mom decided to be a wingman and struck up a conversation amongst us as he walked by to get something about his college (that he was wearing on his shirt) and we discussed a mutual friend I thought he might have with me. The conversation was brief and he sat back down, but a few minutes later he got back up and brought over a picture of the mutual friend on ig to clarify if that was the guy I was talking about.

We had a few more lines of dialogue about where I went to school and what we studied and stuff. Probably the cutest, friendliest guy I’ve interacted with in ages even though it was only about 10 min of conversation. I feel as though maybe he was slightly interested since he came back to talk a little more, but I fumbled so bad by never even attempting to ask for his number, socials, or ANYTHING. Given, he didn’t try either so he very well could’ve not liked me at all for all I know. It also probably didn’t help my mom was right there which is a little awkward. But it’s the fact I never tried and will probably never see him again. It’s really such a small thing to vent about but it’s been eating at my mind all day just bc I don’t come across guys like that ever.

**Appearance:** Eunomia doesn't look to different from most sylonnoids except she has a green color scheme instead of gold or metallic blue, and green eyes. She also has femininity body shape with B-cups.

Ben loves his job, he leads his elite plumber SWAT team(The Alien Force), he the head of the system local galactic enforcers, he the champion of Earth, and he even ambassador for Earth. But there is one thing about job he doesn't like, the paperwork, the at times seemingly endless amount of paperwork. You would think one his super genius chaquetrix girls could help with it but they hate it just as much as him. So they begged him to go out and scan a sylonnoid, a biodroid created for the sole purpose to perform bureaucratic work of all kinds. So he did, and thanks to the chaquetrix having to use some Galvanic Mechamorph genetics in order to created the purely mechanical and technical parts of of their anatomy he got Eunomia. The first fully mechanoid sylonnoid, and therefore the first who can reproduce. Who thanks to her Galvanic Mechamorph genetics is actually better at bureaucratic work then any pure sylonnoid could ever be. And that is something she is truly grateful for as means she can help her family ever. So she a bit annoyed by the fact that she can't help with the kind of fighting Ben and her sisters as sylonnoids simply aren't made for. She can't even learn magic thanks to being mechanoid, in fact only her combat useful skill is that is always calm no matter what. But the fact that her more powerful sisters comes crawling to her do their paperwork(literally).

I tried writing a novel a while ago, but I didn’t get to even finish the very first chapter… I’ll share what I wrote anyway, and hopefully someone spares a few minutes to provide an honest opinion on it.

As im looking at the sky at six in the morning, the sun rising smoothly, filling the sky with honey rays piercing through the clouds, golden warm sweet nothings feathering across the wings of my balcony flowers, i happen to witness two bird couple kissing and cuddling each other in the middle of a long high conducting wire, not caring about the world, their community singing, their community doesn’t care about whether if they’re a gay couple or straight ones, their community just sing smoothly with zero effort, providing peaceful cleansing for everyone’s ears.
My community cares too much about other people’s lives, that care stole away every chance of love I could’ve had. Don’t get me wrong, i did get in involved in love, it just never lasted.

As i look at these birds, i couldn’t really describe my feelings towards what im seeing. Do i envy their love? I don’t know. But i do know that i don’t feel uncomfortable around it. They have each other and that’s what matters.

I barely wake up early, but today i dreamt about love, the kind of love that heals you, the kind of love where he kisses your neck from behind, where he would be silly about giving you a hickey somewhere where nobody can see it, the kind of love where he buys you a flower and gets you chocolate even though you didn’t ask him for chocolate; and i remember knowing that i am in a dream, i tried to stay deep in that dream and never get out, you know that kind of effort you put in when you’re really in a good dream? The effort that you somehow manage to stay dreaming and don’t accidentally escape it. That’s how good my dream was. Dreams steals us from reality, they take us somewhere we always wanted to be, dreams are reality advertisement breaks. I woke up, took a shower, i just stood there, thinking about it, about how his lips felt so real on my neck, about how much i miss them.

I made myself a cup of tea, people do coffee, i don’t, never really craved coffee, tea is like the classic type of drink where its good for everything, for sleeping, relaxing, thinking… coffee is only good when you’re in a bowel movement crisis.
Now here i am, standing here, the tea is getting cold in my hands, the morning cool breeze landing on my forearms, making my whole body shiver, but i don’t want to leave, i like the sound of birds, those few cars that pass making an echo, giving that doppler effect kind of sound… its just so magical. Heck, now i understand why morning people are morning people.
I grabbed my backpack, checked if i have the correct books for today’s schedule, put on my sneakers, and headed out. As im walking around the block, i couldn’t help but notice how the world low-key darkened in these what feel like ten minutes. Dark clouds formed slowly but somehow managed to be…fast? Looking at these dark skies, it’s like they’re holding piles of mysteries inside, ready to expose them on earth’s soils. It started to rain lightly, I managed to get to school before the aggressive wind and rain started. 

First period was english, classmates are discussing and talking about whatever is being discussed and talked about, and then there’s me, long lost in my mind, drowning in a lake of thoughts and overthinking. Im not really a stable person when it comes to focusing, although i do notice details, i can read people and rooms very accurately, but i guess thats just a good sight. Good focus needs a good stable mind, and i certainly didn’t sign up for that. 
“Mr white?” Said mrs. Hendricks.

“Mr white will you please direct your attention to me?” Her voice grew louder.

“Mr white?” She’s sounding angrier.

I felt a pencil on my forearm, interrupting the voices in my head, voices are gone, another voice whispering next to me.

“The teacher is calling you.”

Huh.

“Ugh.. yes, sorry.” I said nervously.

“Mr. White, your constant zoning out is getting worse, you are missing group discussions, important lectures, and assignments.”

“Uhm.. okay…?”

“You are slowly stepping into the verse of fuck-ups.” 
She said.

I took a deep breath trying to refresh my mind.
Did she just say that?
What the hell?

The entire class started laughing ridiculously, I couldn’t see anything but eyes, and the rest was foggy and vague. Laughter echoed in my ears, i felt dizzy. 

Im not really a social person. The total opposite, if invisible coats were a real thing, I would’ve got one instantly. Imagine wanting to be invisible always, and suddenly you became the center of attention. 
World of horror. 
I grabbed my backpack and stormed out into the hallways. The cleaning lady flinched for a second, attempting to make sense of what just happened.
 
“Sorry. Im a little overwhelmed… didn’t mean to jump scare you.” 

She gave me a side look and proceeded with wiping the floor.

I made my way to the bathroom, looked at my red hair, which looked awful in this bathroom’s dim lighting. I don’t know why, my home mirror just loves me more than any mirror in this world.


“Do you think she’s just a player? Maybe she’s just really shy to text back… or maybe she doesn’t know i exist” cherry says.

“Or maybe im overthinking all this, GOSH. alex?”

“ALEX!”

“What!” I yelled.

“Were you even listening to me ?!”

“Yes.” I wasn’t.

“what was i saying then?”

Awkward as fuck silence…

“You’re… really stressed about the math test…?”

Cherry gave me the “run as fast as possible look”.

“OKAY. what?”

“Jeez. Okay. What do you think about the girl i met yesterday? at launch.”

“You mean the weird haired-zombie eyeshadow-skeleton earrings-huge-boots girl?”

She hit me with the eye roll. 

“She’s okay i guess?”

“could you please just fucking focus and give me a normal complete answer?”

What the fuck. Im trying to recall what the hell is an integral here, i had a bar of chocolate for breakfast. Damn that tasted nice.

Cherry is one of the most energetic people you could ever see walking this planet. She does this absolutely magical colorful makeup with rhinestones and shit, she’s just so colorful and joyful, you don’t look at her and think “that’s a messed up person”, she is exactly the opposite, she doesn’t give a flying fuck about the world, i honestly don’t blame her, this world is mid and tiresome, her world is just so colorful and dazzling and filled with joy; she brightens up my world, and here she is now busting out her lesbian drama on me.

“Okay fine, she’s great, her style is not weird, I promise you that, she’s pretty, and she seemed interested in you.”

“Are you being for real?”

“Yes.” I am actually.

“Okay, thank you.”

“But-“

“Oh no.” She said.

Huh?

“There’s a ‘but’ ?”

“Could you just shut up for a second?”

“Okay continue Mr. therapist with a ph.d in lesbian relationships”

I need a massive creamy cake so bad right now, specifically for face smashing.

“You got to be less creepy when it comes to Instagram, you can’t just follow her and start sending her memes and stories and randomly cry about the trauma you got after you lost your parrot…”

She went silent for a moment. She knew i was right.

“You’re right.” She said.

Okay…

“But i just got really excited and nervous and really overwhelmed, I’ll just unfollow.”

Oh my god.

“No. Cherry, honey, you don’t have to unfollow, maybe ask her for her number today, don’t be so pushy, just ask politely with a smile, and if she doesn’t show interest, she’ll let you know.”

“You really think so?”

“Yes.”

“Why is your plate still full?” She asks.

“Im just not hungry.”

“Did you have breakfast this morning?”

“Yes.”

“I swear to god if you say you had a bar of chocolate for breakfa-“

I grabbed my bag and ran out in what seems like a millisecond. 

“Mr. White, im gonna need you to stop running around the campus like a raccoon who’s looking for its mother.” Principal Peyton says. 

“Im sorry, I was just going to-“

“Im gonna need to see you in my office.” She interrupted.

“But i said i was sorry?”

“This isnt regarding your animal-running instincts. It’s about your academic life around here.”

Oh No. I don’t feel easy about where this is going.
My grades are decent, what is going on?

“Okay.” I said.

“See you Mr. White.”  Principal Peyton said.

As im walking through the school’s corridors i met cherry on the way.

“So what’s going on with you?” Asked cherry.

Her lipstick was smudged all over her chin and right below her nostrils.
Has she even looked in the bathroom mirror?

“No, whats going on with YOU?” I asked.

“Whats up with me?” She said, nervously.

“Did you even look in a bathroom mirror?”

“Why whats wrong?” She asked.

“Cherry darling your lipstick is smudged.” I said 

“Oh that. Well…” 

“Oh my god?” I interrupted.

“I’ll tell you everything i promise.” She said blushing.
Oh god.

“Now tell me what’s up with you? You look a bit concerned.” She said.

“The principal called me into her office.”

“Oh what does that old gremlin want now?” She asked.

“Something about my academic work and whatever.” 

“Oh good luck i guess… please try not to murder her.” 

She requested in a sarcastic manner.

“I’ll make sure I’ll do that.” I said, sarcastically, too.

“Then i guess I’ll see you after school love.” She kissed my cheek and rubbed my hair like im some red hair golden retriever. I was, in fact,  a red hair.

“See you honey, it’s carol right?” I said as she was leaving.

“Don’t spoil the tea now babes.” She yelled as she was walking down the hallway.

We giggled and I headed back in the opposite direction towards principal Peyton’s office.

*“You’re a fucking animal, Tom.”* 

Cassandra, volatile with rage, tossed her husband’s cell phone to the floor of their bedroom, intending for the device to clatter and crash melodramatically when it connected with the wood tile. It landed screen-up and spun towards Tom’s feet, gliding smoothly against the ground like an air hockey puck. He hastily bent over to stop his phone’s forward motion, pocketing it without looking at the screen. Tom already knew what pictures would be opened on his messaging app. Instead, he went silent and did not argue, turning his head away from her and submissively placing his hands in the air. The motion was meant to represent a white flag of surrender, but more than that, it was a way of admitting guilt without asking for forgiveness. 

Wordlessly, he pushed past his wife to grab a pillow from his side of the bed and then paced quickly out of the room. Tom turned right as he exited, carefully stepping over a few unopened moving boxes to make his way to their new home’s staircase. With a sound like rolling thunder, he stomped and pounded each foot against every step on his way up. Every petulant boom reverberated and echoed in Cassandra’s mind. When Tom reached the attic, he bellowed something that was clearly meant to be a defamatory finale to his boyish tantrum, but she couldn’t make out exactly what he said from where she still stood motionless in the bedroom. At that moment, any lingering regret about dosing her husband for the first time that morning with the Curandero’s poison evaporated from her, remorse made steam by the molten heat of her seething anger. 

—---------------------------

*“If I’m an animal, you’re a goddamned blood-sucking leech, Cassandra!”* 

Tom’s retreat from his wife had been both unanticipated and expeditious. To that end, he could not think of a retort to her jab until he was three steps out of the bedroom, but he held onto the retort until he reached the safety of the attic’s doorframe. He knew he could belt out his meager insult from that distance without fear of an additional counteroffensive. As soon as the words spilled from his mouth, he tumbled past the threshold into the attic and slammed the door behind him. 

It wasn’t his fault Shiela was swooning over him, Tom smugly mused. She had volunteered those digital pinups of her own volition. That said, he had been actively flirting with the young secretary since the couple landed in Texas two months ago. Their marriage had been in a death spiral for years, in no small part due to Tom’s cyclical infidelity. The cross-country move had been a last-ditch attempt at resuscitating their relationship, but of course, Maine was never the problem to begin with, so the change of scenery mended nothing. In his middle age, Tom developed a gnawing desire to feel warm-blooded and virile. Cassandra’s despondency had the exact opposite effect. She made him feel undesired - sexually anemic. That night was not the first time he had called her a “blood-sucking leech” for that very reason. However, if Tom had been gifted the power of retrospection, he may have noticed that his wife’s frigid disposition became the norm after the discovery of his second affair, not after his first. 

—---------------------------

*“I want something that will make him feel even a small fraction of the insanity he’s put me through”*

Cassandra whispered to the Curandero, visually scanning the entire antique store for possible interlopers or undercover police officers before she asked the purveyor of hexes standing behind the counter for anything definitive and incriminating. Multiple family members had recommended this unassuming shop on the outskirts of downtown Austin for an answer to Tom’s beastliness. The apothecary grinned and asked her to wait a moment, turning to enter a backroom concealed by a red silk curtain. The witch doctor was not what Cassandra expected - she couldn’t have been older than thirty, and she certainly did not present herself like a practitioner of black magic. No cataracts, scars or gemstone necklaces - instead, she sported an oversized gray turtleneck with part of a floral sundress peeking out from the bottom. 

She returned seconds later, tilted her body over the counter, and handed Cassandra a vial no bigger than a shot glass. Inside the vial were innumerable tiny blue crystals. They were slightly oblong and transparent, looking like the illegitimate children of rock candy and fishfood. The Curandero cheerily instructed Cassandra to give her husband the entire ampule’s contents over the course of about three days. As she left the store, the shopkeeper cryptically reassured Cassandra that her husband would be thoroughly educated on his wrongdoings by the loving kiss of retribution. 

—---------------------------

*“Why is it so fucking cold up here”*

Tom mumbled to himself, doing laps around the perimeter of his makeshift sleeping quarters in the attic. It had been approximately three weeks since their argument and his subsequent relocation. At first, he didn’t much mind it. The cold war between him and Cassandra was taxing, but he had his phone and Shiela’s escalating solicitations to keep him company. But as of the last few days, he had begun to feel progressively unwell - feverish and malaised. Then he noticed the small lump on the underside of his left wrist. 

It was about the size of a dime, skin-colored, immobile, and profoundly itchy. Tom felt like he spent almost every waking minute massaging the area. The irritation then became accompanied by white-hot burning pain, gradually extending up his arm as the days passed. One night, as he scratched the area, the lump moved a centimeter closer to his palm. He paused to inspect the change, assuming the vexing cyst had finally been dislodged and neutralized. After a few seconds, however,  it moved again - but in the opposite direction and without Tom’s help. And then again, slightly further up his forearm. Revitalized by panic and confusion, he began clawing recklessly at the lump, until the skin broke and a small black button was liberated from the wound, only to scurry away to an unseen sanctuary. Tom thought the button looked and moved like a deer tick. 

—---------------------------

*“Sure, Tom, come back down. But to the couch, for now, okay?”*

Cassandra had accepted many empty apologies from Tom before, but something about this most recent one felt slightly more sincere. By this point, she had completely forgotten about the Curandero and her vengeful prescription. Cassandra had gone through with slipping the contents into Tom’s coffee over the course of three days, but that was over a month ago. At the time, she did not really believe it was black magic - she assumed it was a military-grade laxative or some other, ultimately benign, poison. 

The more she thought about Tom’s behavior, however, she came to realize that she may have been mistaking a sincere apology for what was actually fear and need for comfort. Cassandra had not interacted much with Tom in the past few weeks, but now that she was, he was certainly acting off. Seemingly at random, he would slam his palm down on himself or something else in front of him and then would be unwilling to give an explanation. He slurred his words like a drunken sailor, but as far she could tell, he hadn’t been drinking. When she looked into Tom’s eyes to find that his pupils were rapidly dilating and constricting like black holes on the verge of collapse, the realization hit like a lightning strike up her spine. Cassandra remembered the vial with the blue crystals. 

She was at the Curandero’s shop within the hour, catching the witch doctor right as she was locking up her store. Cassandra pleaded with her for an antidote to whatever magic or venom was now in Tom’s system. In response, the shopkeeper produced another identical vial from her jacket pocket, twisted the cap off, and dropped a few of the crystals into her mouth:

*“It’s dyed salt, my love”* the Curandero said, then pausing to tap out a few fragments onto the backside of Cassandra’s hand as a means to corroborate her claim. *“I don’t sell power, just the idea of power. Whatever you made manifest, I only provided the inspiration”*

Confused and without clear direction, Cassandra returned home to check on her husband. 

—---------------------------

Tom had never been thirstier in his entire life, but he could not drink. Every time he poured himself water, he carefully inspected it through the transparent glass, only to find it contaminated with hundreds of ticks - an entire galaxy of black stars drifting aimlessly through the liquid microcosm. Sitting at his kitchen table with his head in his hands, Tom cried out in agony, only to have his wail cut short by his vocal cords unexpectedly snapping shut. 

What had started as an infestation had become a plague. 

The gentle touch of a hand on his shoulder nearly scared him half to death, causing him to jump back off his chair and knock the infested glass off the table and onto the kitchen floor, shattering it instantly. He took a breath, seeing that it was only Cassandra, but that relief was short-lived when he looked back down to see an armada of nymphs moving on his position. He yelped and scrambled on top of a cabinet. His wife moved forward, seemingly to comfort him. When she held his hand, Cassandra noticed the open wound where that first tick had sprouted, and she rushed into the other room to procure bandages. For a moment, Tom felt safe. His wife began attending to his wound while he was still perched on the cabinet. But then he felt a pinch on his left wrist, followed by an intense lacerating sting, and then finally, the sensation of warm fluid gushing down his palm. When he looked down, his wife looked up at him in tandem. 

Cassandra’s mouth had mutated into a pulsating arena of hooked teeth, with plasma delicately dripping from the barbs she had just used to bite into him. In one swift motion, Tom pivoted his torso, unsheathed a blade from a nearby knife block, drove it deep into the creature’s abdomen, and sprinted out the house and into the street. 

—---------------------------

Cassandra nearly bled out on her kitchen floor, but a neighbor heard the commotion and had called the police. 

She awoke in the ICU surrounded by family. When she asked them what happened, they paused awkwardly and traded solemn expressions with each other instead of explaining. When Cassandra pressed for information, they flagged down her doctor from the hallway.

The physician did not mince words with Cassandra. Tom was dead - he had been picked up by the police fleeing the neighborhood but had been delivered to the same ICU she was currently in when he started to wheeze violently and turn blue.  

*“Do you have any pets, dogs especially?”* The doctor asked. *“Where in your house do you and your husband sleep? Have you ever seen any bats in your home?”*

Cassandra explained that they had bought their home recently, that Tom had been sleeping alone in their attic after a particularly nasty argument, and that she had seen a bat fly out a window once when they were moving in. She then detailed her husband’s odd behavior in the time leading up to her assault. 

The physician frowned and then elaborated on their suspicions:

*“The dilating pupils, the hallucinations, the fear of water, and the inspiratory spasms - they all suggest that your husband contracted rabies while living in your attic. Most of the time, people in the US contract the disease from a dog bite. However, bats are known to transmit the disease, too. What’s worse - if bats are in your home, they can bite you in your sleep without you waking up. If contracted, the disease is universally fatal, and there is no known treatment.* 

*Tom died from his airway spasms.* 

*You nearly died, too - from blood loss. Did you know you have an extremely rare blood type? AB negative. Only 1% of the population has this blood type, and unfortunately, the hospital has been critically low on replacement blood that is AB negative for almost a month now.* 

*We were initially very concerned - you needed more AB negative blood than we had, but as serendipity would have it, Tom was AB negative as well. Imagine that.* 

*Thankfully, rabies cannot be contracted through the blood - only through saliva. That’s why it is contracted through bites. Although it was unconventional, our administration gave us the green light to give you a large portion of his blood. In essence, Tom’s blood saved your life”*

The doctor paused, waiting patiently for whatever questions Cassandra had. 

But she had none. Instead, there was an eerie, uncomfortable silence for almost a minute.

Then, Cassandra tilted her head back, closed her eyes, wept, and had a very long laugh.

I tried writing a novel a while ago, but I didn’t get to even finish the very first chapter… I’ll share what I wrote anyway, and hopefully someone spares a few minutes to provide an honest opinion on it.","As im looking at the sky at six in the morning, the sun rising smoothly, filling the sky with honey rays piercing through the clouds, golden warm sweet nothings feathering across the wings of my balcony flowers, i happen to witness two bird couple kissing and cuddling each other in the middle of a long high conducting wire, not caring about the world, their community singing, their community doesn’t care about whether if they’re a gay couple or straight ones, their community just sing smoothly with zero effort, providing peaceful cleansing for everyone’s ears.
My community cares too much about other people’s lives, that care stole away every chance of love I could’ve had. Don’t get me wrong, i did get in involved in love, it just never lasted.

As i look at these birds, i couldn’t really describe my feelings towards what im seeing. Do i envy their love? I don’t know. But i do know that i don’t feel uncomfortable around it. They have each other and that’s what matters.

I barely wake up early, but today i dreamt about love, the kind of love that heals you, the kind of love where he kisses your neck from behind, where he would be silly about giving you a hickey somewhere where nobody can see it, the kind of love where he buys you a flower and gets you chocolate even though you didn’t ask him for chocolate; and i remember knowing that i am in a dream, i tried to stay deep in that dream and never get out, you know that kind of effort you put in when you’re really in a good dream? The effort that you somehow manage to stay dreaming and don’t accidentally escape it. That’s how good my dream was. Dreams steals us from reality, they take us somewhere we always wanted to be, dreams are reality advertisement breaks. I woke up, took a shower, i just stood there, thinking about it, about how his lips felt so real on my neck, about how much i miss them.

I made myself a cup of tea, people do coffee, i don’t, never really craved coffee, tea is like the classic type of drink where its good for everything, for sleeping, relaxing, thinking… coffee is only good when you’re in a bowel movement crisis.
Now here i am, standing here, the tea is getting cold in my hands, the morning cool breeze landing on my forearms, making my whole body shiver, but i don’t want to leave, i like the sound of birds, those few cars that pass making an echo, giving that doppler effect kind of sound… its just so magical. Heck, now i understand why morning people are morning people.

“Whats up with me?” She said, nervously.

“Did you even look in a bathroom mirror?”

“Why whats wrong?” She asked.

“Cherry darling your lipstick is smudged.” I said 

“Oh that. Well…” 

“Oh my god?” I interrupted.

“I’ll tell you everything i promise.” She said blushing.
Oh god.

“Now tell me what’s up with you? You look a bit concerned.” She said.

“The principal called me into her office.”

“Oh what does that old gremlin want now?” She asked.

“Something about my academic work and whatever.” 

“Oh good luck i guess… please try not to murder her.” 

She requested in a sarcastic manner.

“I’ll make sure I’ll do that.” I said, sarcastically, too.

“Then i guess I’ll see you after school love.” She kissed my cheek and rubbed my hair like im some red hair golden retriever. I was, in fact,  a red hair.

“See you honey, it’s carol right?” I said as she was leaving.

“Don’t spoil the tea now babes.” She yelled as she was walking down the hallway.

We giggled and I headed back in the opposite direction towards principal Peyton’s office.

I instinctively poured you a cup but you aren't here

I sigh, and crawl back into bed

Expecting your body and your warmth but the bed's so cold

I went to call you but the phone just rang and rang 

It's so hard, knowing that I'm alone here 

I seen the stars tonight they just don't seem as bright 

And the moon doesn't seem to talk as much 

Maybe she's busy talking away the night with you 

My heart is aching, my head is pounding 

I'm lost, so deep in these memories of the times 

You walked these halls, your laugh filled the empty rooms

How could I ever forget that, knowing you aren't dead 

You are just at home across town, sleeping soundly 

Hopefully dreaming beautiful dreams 

Of the next time you are in my arms

1h323wi,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1h323wi/what_is_the_second_part_of_the_starbucks_store/,What is the Second Part of the Starbucks Store Numbers? ,"This is an arcane Starbucks detail, about as inside baseball as it gets, and interesting to only a few people, but it's been driving me nuts for a long time.

Long ago, a decade or two, maybe three, each Starbucks had a simple number, and those numbers increased as Starbucks added stores. For example, the Columbia Center location, one of the earliest (conωerted from Il Giornale once Howard Schultz bought out the original owners), had store #101.

  
These simple stores numbers, like 101, show up on the printed receipt when I buy coffee, and you would often find the store number on the community board and other places around a store. And if you asked a barista ""what is your store number"", they would give you that simple number. 

  
At some point, however, Starbucks started adding a hyphen and a second number to the store number, and you can see the ""extended store number"" if you go to Transaction History -> History on your Starbucks app then click on a transaction (see image)...  

https://preview.redd.it/6blq4f9f3y3e1.png?width=1075&format=png&auto=webp&s=c443934495bac77c7eca8a16153146ad5652be91

  
Additionally, you can see the extended store number on the URL if you go to the store locator on the Starbucks website and click on the info for a particular store...

[https://www.starbucks.com/store-locator/store/71323-302198/n-lamar-blvd-airport-blvd-6903-airport-blvd-austin-tx-787523604-us](https://www.starbucks.com/store-locator/store/71323-302198/n-lamar-blvd-airport-blvd-6903-airport-blvd-austin-tx-787523604-us) 

  
So the question I'm craving an answer for (because I'm a huge Starbucks nerd and really into their inner workings) is WHAT IS THE SECOND PART OF THE EXTENDED STORE NUMBER?

  
I imagine that relatively few people on the entire planet know the answer to this. This has to be some accounting or IT detail, and there really is no reason for anybody outside the releωant department to know. I'd be surprised if any manager, district manager, or even regional manager would know this, and certainly not Starbucks Customer Care.

  
So my only hope in posting this here is that this subreddit has some member who knows somebody in Seattle who knows somebody who knows somebody who knows the right person to ask to figure out which department assigns these and then can track down somebody willing to share the answer.

  
If you can figure this out, I'd gladly buy you a coffee.

This Shari’s abrupt closed in April of 2023 after being there for more than 40 years. Here are some pictures of when it was Shari’s and the new restaurant currently. Andy’s has replaced it and has kept the building almost virtually unchanged. It appears that this place does not have the best positive appeal though as it’s only rated 2.8 out of 100 reviews on google, but I have never been there or heard of this place if it’s a chain, so I will not judge as they DO have some good reviews. You can read the closing of this store and the Richmond one at the link below. If you know anything else important about Andy’s let us know below! 



“On Monday, a vendor pulled up to remove equipment and someone inside appeared to be cleaning up. Pies were still visible in a pastry case near the cash register. Staff told longtime cook at Shari’s that they’d been given 72 hours notice on Thursday that the restaurant would close Sunday.”

Her music sounds like any other pop artist that came from Disney channel. Her music isn't THAT bad. It's generic pop that sounds like it belongs in a kohls/clothing store commercial..but I'd rather listen to guilty pleasure than expresso/please please please and any Olivia Rodrigo song. That's not to say Jojo isn't cringey..she is. But she gets called cringe for the same things other pop stars do, while they get praised for the same cringey execution.

Karma, was horrible but not because of jojo. I didn't like the original either. It was corny and the lyrics were very basic...dont know what timbaland was thinking when he jumped on that song because usually his beats and productions are top tier. Brit Smith didn't sing it any better.

I'll admit I actually like guilty pleasure. The song is catchy. The only thing cringe about it was the weird music video with the teddy bears being overly sexual. Now jojo is far from a vocalist so imagine if she could sing well! I feel like the song could have hit the charts and stayed there for the whole summer.

Jojo recently dropped a snippet of a song called ""iced coffee"" and while the hook sounds like a kidz bop song..the song isn't as bad as people were making it out to be. The lyric ""love the way you grind on my bean"" would not have been cringe to everyone if Sabrina Carpenter or Ariana Grande sang it. It's only cringe because it's JoJo Siwa..nobody said anything about Sabrina carpenters horrible songs about sex.. yes jojo tries way too hard to be sexy but so does Sabrina. I mean Sabrina mimicked oral sex with a microphone...we get it, you're petite,blonde and pretty which is sexually appealing. A tik tok creator actually compared Sabrina carpenters music to JoJos and people were like ""Sabrina's execution is different/better""...how?! Sabrina is cringey too in my opinion. Jojo's songs probably would be more liked if she wasn't the one singing them.

*“You’re a fucking animal, Tom.”* 

Cassandra, volatile with rage, tossed her husband’s cell phone to the floor of their bedroom, intending for the device to clatter and crash melodramatically when it connected with the wood tile. It landed screen-up and spun towards Tom’s feet, gliding smoothly against the ground like an air hockey puck. He hastily bent over to stop his phone’s forward motion, pocketing it without looking at the screen. Tom already knew what pictures would be opened on his messaging app. Instead, he went silent and did not argue, turning his head away from her and submissively placing his hands in the air. The motion was meant to represent a white flag of surrender, but more than that, it was a way of admitting guilt without asking for forgiveness. 

Wordlessly, he pushed past his wife to grab a pillow from his side of the bed and then paced quickly out of the room. Tom turned right as he exited, carefully stepping over a few unopened moving boxes to make his way to their new home’s staircase. With a sound like rolling thunder, he stomped and pounded each foot against every step on his way up. Every petulant boom reverberated and echoed in Cassandra’s mind. When Tom reached the attic, he bellowed something that was clearly meant to be a defamatory finale to his boyish tantrum, but she couldn’t make out exactly what he said from where she still stood motionless in the bedroom. At that moment, any lingering regret about dosing her husband for the first time that morning with the Curandero’s poison evaporated from her, remorse made steam by the molten heat of her seething anger. 

—---------------------------

*“If I’m an animal, you’re a goddamned blood-sucking leech, Cassandra!”* 

Tom’s retreat from his wife had been both unanticipated and expeditious. To that end, he could not think of a retort to her jab until he was three steps out of the bedroom, but he held onto the retort until he reached the safety of the attic’s doorframe. He knew he could belt out his meager insult from that distance without fear of an additional counteroffensive. As soon as the words spilled from his mouth, he tumbled past the threshold into the attic and slammed the door behind him. 

It wasn’t his fault Shiela was swooning over him, Tom smugly mused. She had volunteered those digital pinups of her own volition. That said, he had been actively flirting with the young secretary since the couple landed in Texas two months ago. Their marriage had been in a death spiral for years, in no small part due to Tom’s cyclical infidelity. The cross-country move had been a last-ditch attempt at resuscitating their relationship, but of course, Maine was never the problem to begin with, so the change of scenery mended nothing. In his middle age, Tom developed a gnawing desire to feel warm-blooded and virile. Cassandra’s despondency had the exact opposite effect. She made him feel undesired - sexually anemic. That night was not the first time he had called her a “blood-sucking leech” for that very reason. However, if Tom had been gifted the power of retrospection, he may have noticed that his wife’s frigid disposition became the norm after the discovery of his second affair, not after his first. 

—---------------------------

*“I want something that will make him feel even a small fraction of the insanity he’s put me through”*

Cassandra whispered to the Curandero, visually scanning the entire antique store for possible interlopers or undercover police officers before she asked the purveyor of hexes standing behind the counter for anything definitive and incriminating. Multiple family members had recommended this unassuming shop on the outskirts of downtown Austin for an answer to Tom’s beastliness. The apothecary grinned and asked her to wait a moment, turning to enter a backroom concealed by a red silk curtain. The witch doctor was not what Cassandra expected - she couldn’t have been older than thirty, and she certainly did not present herself like a practitioner of black magic. No cataracts, scars or gemstone necklaces - instead, she sported an oversized gray turtleneck with part of a floral sundress peeking out from the bottom. 

She returned seconds later, tilted her body over the counter, and handed Cassandra a vial no bigger than a shot glass. Inside the vial were innumerable tiny blue crystals. They were slightly oblong and transparent, looking like the illegitimate children of rock candy and fishfood. The Curandero cheerily instructed Cassandra to give her husband the entire ampule’s contents over the course of about three days. As she left the store, the shopkeeper cryptically reassured Cassandra that her husband would be thoroughly educated on his wrongdoings by the loving kiss of retribution. 

—---------------------------

*“Why is it so fucking cold up here”*

Tom mumbled to himself, doing laps around the perimeter of his makeshift sleeping quarters in the attic. It had been approximately three weeks since their argument and his subsequent relocation. At first, he didn’t much mind it. The cold war between him and Cassandra was taxing, but he had his phone and Shiela’s escalating solicitations to keep him company. But as of the last few days, he had begun to feel progressively unwell - feverish and malaised. Then he noticed the small lump on the underside of his left wrist. 

It was about the size of a dime, skin-colored, immobile, and profoundly itchy. Tom felt like he spent almost every waking minute massaging the area. The irritation then became accompanied by white-hot burning pain, gradually extending up his arm as the days passed. One night, as he scratched the area, the lump moved a centimeter closer to his palm. He paused to inspect the change, assuming the vexing cyst had finally been dislodged and neutralized. After a few seconds, however,  it moved again - but in the opposite direction and without Tom’s help. And then again, slightly further up his forearm. Revitalized by panic and confusion, he began clawing recklessly at the lump, until the skin broke and a small black button was liberated from the wound, only to scurry away to an unseen sanctuary. Tom thought the button looked and moved like a deer tick. 

—---------------------------

*“Sure, Tom, come back down. But to the couch, for now, okay?”*

Cassandra had accepted many empty apologies from Tom before, but something about this most recent one felt slightly more sincere. By this point, she had completely forgotten about the Curandero and her vengeful prescription. Cassandra had gone through with slipping the contents into Tom’s coffee over the course of three days, but that was over a month ago. At the time, she did not really believe it was black magic - she assumed it was a military-grade laxative or some other, ultimately benign, poison. 

The more she thought about Tom’s behavior, however, she came to realize that she may have been mistaking a sincere apology for what was actually fear and need for comfort. Cassandra had not interacted much with Tom in the past few weeks, but now that she was, he was certainly acting off. Seemingly at random, he would slam his palm down on himself or something else in front of him and then would be unwilling to give an explanation. He slurred his words like a drunken sailor, but as far she could tell, he hadn’t been drinking. When she looked into Tom’s eyes to find that his pupils were rapidly dilating and constricting like black holes on the verge of collapse, the realization hit like a lightning strike up her spine. Cassandra remembered the vial with the blue crystals. 

She was at the Curandero’s shop within the hour, catching the witch doctor right as she was locking up her store. Cassandra pleaded with her for an antidote to whatever magic or venom was now in Tom’s system. In response, the shopkeeper produced another identical vial from her jacket pocket, twisted the cap off, and dropped a few of the crystals into her mouth:

*“It’s dyed salt, my love”* the Curandero said, then pausing to tap out a few fragments onto the backside of Cassandra’s hand as a means to corroborate her claim. *“I don’t sell power, just the idea of power. Whatever you made manifest, I only provided the inspiration”*

Confused and without clear direction, Cassandra returned home to check on her husband. 

—---------------------------

Tom had never been thirstier in his entire life, but he could not drink. Every time he poured himself water, he carefully inspected it through the transparent glass, only to find it contaminated with hundreds of ticks - an entire galaxy of black stars drifting aimlessly through the liquid microcosm. Sitting at his kitchen table with his head in his hands, Tom cried out in agony, only to have his wail cut short by his vocal cords unexpectedly snapping shut. 

What had started as an infestation had become a plague. 

The gentle touch of a hand on his shoulder nearly scared him half to death, causing him to jump back off his chair and knock the infested glass off the table and onto the kitchen floor, shattering it instantly. He took a breath, seeing that it was only Cassandra, but that relief was short-lived when he looked back down to see an armada of nymphs moving on his position. He yelped and scrambled on top of a cabinet. His wife moved forward, seemingly to comfort him. When she held his hand, Cassandra noticed the open wound where that first tick had sprouted, and she rushed into the other room to procure bandages. For a moment, Tom felt safe. His wife began attending to his wound while he was still perched on the cabinet. But then he felt a pinch on his left wrist, followed by an intense lacerating sting, and then finally, the sensation of warm fluid gushing down his palm. When he looked down, his wife looked up at him in tandem. 

Cassandra’s mouth had mutated into a pulsating arena of hooked teeth, with plasma delicately dripping from the barbs she had just used to bite into him. In one swift motion, Tom pivoted his torso, unsheathed a blade from a nearby knife block, drove it deep into the creature’s abdomen, and sprinted out the house and into the street. 

—---------------------------

Cassandra nearly bled out on her kitchen floor, but a neighbor heard the commotion and had called the police. 

She awoke in the ICU surrounded by family. When she asked them what happened, they paused awkwardly and traded solemn expressions with each other instead of explaining. When Cassandra pressed for information, they flagged down her doctor from the hallway.

The physician did not mince words with Cassandra. Tom was dead - he had been picked up by the police fleeing the neighborhood but had been delivered to the same ICU she was currently in when he started to wheeze violently and turn blue.  

*“Do you have any pets, dogs especially?”* The doctor asked. *“Where in your house do you and your husband sleep? Have you ever seen any bats in your home?”*

Cassandra explained that they had bought their home recently, that Tom had been sleeping alone in their attic after a particularly nasty argument, and that she had seen a bat fly out a window once when they were moving in. She then detailed her husband’s odd behavior in the time leading up to her assault. 

The physician frowned and then elaborated on their suspicions:

*“The dilating pupils, the hallucinations, the fear of water, and the inspiratory spasms - they all suggest that your husband contracted rabies while living in your attic. Most of the time, people in the US contract the disease from a dog bite. However, bats are known to transmit the disease, too. What’s worse - if bats are in your home, they can bite you in your sleep without you waking up. If contracted, the disease is universally fatal, and there is no known treatment.* 

*Tom died from his airway spasms.* 

*You nearly died, too - from blood loss. Did you know you have an extremely rare blood type? AB negative. Only 1% of the population has this blood type, and unfortunately, the hospital has been critically low on replacement blood that is AB negative for almost a month now.* 

*We were initially very concerned - you needed more AB negative blood than we had, but as serendipity would have it, Tom was AB negative as well. Imagine that.* 

*Thankfully, rabies cannot be contracted through the blood - only through saliva. That’s why it is contracted through bites. Although it was unconventional, our administration gave us the green light to give you a large portion of his blood. In essence, Tom’s blood saved your life”*

The doctor paused, waiting patiently for whatever questions Cassandra had. 

But she had none. Instead, there was an eerie, uncomfortable silence for almost a minute.

Then, Cassandra tilted her head back, closed her eyes, wept, and had a very long laugh.

1h31s3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/insurance_recruiting/comments/1h31s3p/understanding_your_sphere_of_influence_and/,Understanding Your Sphere of Influence and Recruiting Through Attraction not Promotion ,"Understanding Your Sphere of Influence and Recruiting Through Attraction not Promotion 

Your sphere of influence is a powerful and often underutilized asset in both personal and professional life. It encompasses the people you interact with regularly—family, friends, colleagues, community members, and acquaintances. These individuals already know you, trust you, and respect your opinions, which makes them an ideal starting point when recruiting for your insurance business. However, success in leveraging your sphere of influence comes not from aggressive promotion, but through attraction.

This article explores what your sphere of influence is, why it matters, and how you can recruit from it by embodying the values, behaviors, and mindset that inspire others to join your mission.

What Is Your Sphere of Influence?

Your sphere of influence refers to the network of people whose lives you impact regularly through your words, actions, and presence. This includes:

Personal Relationships: Family members, friends, and neighbors.

Professional Contacts: Colleagues, clients, mentors, and industry peers.

Community Connections: Members of clubs, organizations, religious groups, or local communities.

Social Networks: Online connections through platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, or Instagram.

This group extends beyond immediate connections to include those influenced indirectly by your actions or reputation. Understanding the breadth of your sphere gives you clarity on how and where you can make the greatest impact.

Why Your Sphere of Influence Matters

Your sphere of influence is the foundation of trust. These individuals already have a relationship with you, which eliminates the initial barrier of skepticism. Leveraging this network can:

Accelerate Recruitment: People who trust you are more likely to listen and consider your opportunities.

Foster Long-Term Relationships: Building from within your sphere creates deeper and more loyal connections.

Enhance Credibility: Your personal success and authenticity serve as a natural testament to the value you bring.

By focusing on attraction rather than promotion, you avoid the pitfalls of coming across as salesy or insincere, which can alienate even the closest connections.

The Principle of Attraction Over Promotion

Attraction-based recruiting is about inspiring others through your actions, lifestyle, and success. It’s not about pitching, pressuring, or over-promoting an opportunity. Instead, it’s about:

Being Authentic: Show people the real you, including your challenges and triumphs.

Living Your Values: Embody the principles you advocate, whether it’s hard work, integrity, or balance.

Demonstrating Success: Let your results speak for themselves without bragging or overselling.

Providing Value: Share insights, tips, or support that benefits others without expecting immediate returns.

People are drawn to leaders who inspire confidence, trust, and hope. By focusing on who you are rather than what you’re selling, you create a natural pull that brings people to you.

Steps to Recruit from Your Sphere of Influence

1. Identify Your Network

Start by mapping out your sphere of influence. Use these categories to brainstorm names:

Family and extended family.

Close friends and casual acquaintances.

Former and current coworkers.

Clients, vendors, or business partners.

Members of community groups or social circles.

Once you have your list, identify individuals who align with your values and might be open to exploring opportunities.

2. Focus on Relationships First

Recruiting from your sphere isn’t about making a quick pitch. It’s about nurturing relationships. Reconnect with people authentically:

Call or meet for coffee to catch up.

Show genuine interest in their lives and goals.

Offer support or advice without an agenda.

Building trust and rapport ensures that when the time comes to discuss opportunities, the conversation feels natural and well-received.

3. Be a Magnet, Not a Megaphone

People are more likely to join you when they see the value in what you’re doing. Share your journey and success through:

Social Media Posts: Highlight achievements, personal growth, and milestones in a way that’s relatable and inspiring.

Storytelling: Share compelling stories about how the business has positively impacted your life.

Living the Lifestyle: Demonstrate the balance, freedom, or purpose you’ve achieved through your work.

Avoid constant promotions or overly transactional posts, which can feel pushy and inauthentic.

4. Listen and Align Opportunities

When the time is right to discuss your business, make it about them, not you. Ask about their goals, challenges, and dreams. Then:

Show how your business aligns with their aspirations.

Explain the benefits in terms of their values and needs.

Offer solutions, not just opportunities.

The key is to position your business as a way to help them achieve their goals rather than simply recruiting them for your benefit.

5. Leverage Success Stories

Share examples of others in your network who have found success through your business. Relatable, real-life stories help potential recruits envision themselves achieving similar results.

6. Be Patient and Consistent

Recruitment is a marathon, not a sprint. Not everyone in your sphere will be ready to join immediately, and that’s okay. Stay consistent in your actions and messaging, and trust that the seeds you plant today will bear fruit in the future.

Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Over-Promoting: Constantly pitching opportunities can damage relationships and make you seem insincere.

Neglecting Relationships: Treating people as prospects rather than friends or colleagues erodes trust.

Focusing Only on Outcomes: Celebrate progress and growth, not just end results.

Ignoring Feedback: Listen to what your sphere is telling you and adjust your approach accordingly.

The Long-Term Benefits of Attraction-Based Recruitment

When you focus on recruiting through attraction, you build a team of like-minded individuals who share your values and vision. This creates a culture of trust, collaboration, and mutual respect. Over time, your network grows organically as your team members replicate the same principles within their own spheres of influence.

By prioritizing relationships, authenticity, and value, you ensure that your business grows sustainably and that you maintain the respect and trust of your sphere of influence. Ultimately, this approach not only strengthens your team but also deepens your personal connections and enhances your overall happiness and satisfaction.

Your sphere of influence is a treasure trove of potential—not just for building a business but for enriching your life. Recruit with intention, authenticity, and care, and watch how the power of attraction can transform your team and your future.

First of all, it's really flimsy. The 2 halves fit into each other like coffee filters, or keg cups. The memory card thingy is to show just how deep of a valley there is on the back of the slab, really weird looking. Now the label...
I picked a random Lorcana card with huge population numbers, like PSA 9: 602, PSA 10: 642...crazy numbers right?! That's the d23 Mickey Mouse card. I don't own that card, I have never been to the d23 expo, and I'm not going to buy one to pretend I was. Anyway the label, apart from being the only Gem Mint 9 in the world (goddamn you Mongorians! Get it together!) there's no tiny PSA logos inside the sparkly areas, FAIL. The G in Gem has a penis, impressive, but FAIL. Here's what they got right: Fugitive ink watermark (the wavy blue lines and faint PSA logo on the front), the big PSA on back is indeed metallic, and is surrounded by 6 smaller logos. The QR code and barcode scan properly, and that's the end of the ""good job"" section. I put a MTG card in there just to see how it would fit and it definitely rattles when you shake the slab. 
Conclusion: These aren't going to be much of a threat to serious collectors. If they actually spent a little bit more on the slab it might be an issue, but these are a joke.

(the same one we met at back in 2014). Our roles this year were very different- mine was very demanding and I struggled with having to be ""on"" from 8 am to 11 pm. His schedule was a lot more relaxed, since he was basically on the catering team this year and was only really busy around mealtimes amd doing grocery runs here and there.  I actually cried a few times and he knew how stressed I was. 

We flew home on Wednesday- the night before Thanksgiving, and got home around 8 pm. I crashed and went to bed early because I was exhausted and knew I had to make pies for Thanksgiving in the morning.  

Thanksgiving is with his family - mine lives 1500 miles away.  His aunt sent out dish assignments on what to bring a month or so ago and assigned me pies because I love to bake.  

I was exhausted, but I got up at 5 a.m. on Thanksgiving and made 5 pies to take (key lime, apple and cherry crumb). I cleaned up as I went, but the kitchen was not in perfect shape because we had to leave at 2 pm for a 3 pm Thanksgiving. 

On the way home, my husband told me that he expected me to clean the rest of the kitchen the second we got home because he thought it was stupid that I made pies and said I shouldn't have made anything (literally the terms he used). I told him that I was tired and since he hadn't done anything all day, he could clean up or let me do it on my own timeline - which would be within 24 hours.  He got upset and said I should have done it immediately.  I ended up telling him the conversation was over and I needed space when we got home.  

This morning, I slept in until 7 and he sat down next to me while I drank my coffee, saying how stressed out he was about the dishes and how disappointed he was that they weren't done yet, and that he needed me to empty all of our suitcases today (yes, ours- not just mine, but his as well). He also said he wanted to do our own mini Thanksgiving and needed me to go to the store with him today. I told him that I would still do things on my own timeline but I was exhausted and needed a break after being at a busy conference for a week and then having to do desserts for his family Thanksgiving. He said that I was ignoring his feelings, at which point I said that he hadn't shown any regard for my feelings - he didn't check in on my physical or emotional state post conference, that I was okay after our fight the day before, etc. and had instead just piled his stressors on my plate, which was selfish and made me feel like he didn't care about me - only what I could do for him. 

He blew up and started yelling that I didn't care about him or his needs and that I never should have made the pies if I wasn't going to clean up the second we got back.  I responded by saying it was for his family and I was told to make them, so he could shove it, and that I felt very disconnected from him but didn't think this conversation was productive, so I was done talking to him.  

He kept blowing up and yelling and said that I treat him like he's a bully and I said that was exactly what he was doing - I had set a boundary and stated the conversation was over and he was still yelling at me. 

He stormed away yelling and slamming things and hasn't talked to me since. I think he's being an AH and it isn't my job to fix things with him, so I haven't tried to engage with him all day. But since he hasn't tried to talk to me either, I'm wondering if I'm actually the AH or if it's him? ",0,1732931269.0,AITAH,6,0.5,False

Every day, we walk our dogs down this street where a couple, who seem to be around our age, lives (a couple streets down from our house). Over time, we’ve exchanged waves and smiles when they’re walking their dog or when the guy is playing basketball in the driveway. We’ve never actually had a conversation, but they seem like cool people we might get along with!

Here’s the thing: it’s gotten colder out recently, and we haven’t seen them outside at all in the past few weeks. We’d been hoping for an opportunity to strike up a conversation in person, but now we’re considering leaving a note in their mailbox instead.

The note would be something casual, just introducing ourselves and seeing if they’d be interested in hanging out sometime—like a double date, grabbing coffee, or even a dog walk together. We’d also acknowledge in the note that this is a bit unconventional, and I would leave my Instagram handle for them to see that we’re real (hoping they have one). I’d also leave my phone number. 

Honestly, we’re both 29, and it feels so hard to make new friends as adults. So, we thought, why not just put ourselves out there?

A former military man, I’ve carved out a fulfilling life with hard work, loyalty, and plenty of laughter—but I’m ready to share it all with someone special.

I’m emotionally and financially prepared for what’s next: marriage, kids, and all the joys (and occasional chaos) of family life. I don’t smoke or do drugs, but I do love coffee, the occasional drink, and staying active.

When I’m not working, you’ll find me traveling the world, scuba diving, riding my motorcycles, cooking up a storm, or even renovating my house—I did all the work myself! I’m also into woodworking, boating, binge-watching a good show, and spending time with family. I stay active and take pride in living a healthy lifestyle, and I’d love to find someone who shares that mindset.

I’m looking for a partner in her 20s or early 30s who’s kind, emotionally available, and on a good path in life. Bonus points if you’re as excited as I am about building a family!

My sister told me she tried to text me earlier this year and so I decided to reach back out and apologize for being so on and off with her over the years. 

She reacted to it with 🥰 and responded saying “It's okay, (my name) ❤️ I was shitty to you at times in the past! And truly I was okay with you being off and on, because I understood it. It didn't make me angry, it just always made me think of you even more and really with all the more happiness for you. You can message me any time you want. I'm not always on Facebook of course, but if I see it's from you I'll answer. I genuinely hope that you're doing well, and that things are going good. We're at that time in our lives personally where I personally rewatch my dumbass self stumble through my 20s just wishinggg l could go back and not do all the shit I ever did. Of course, I cannot. But I am thankful to still know people from my past throughout all this time and change, and I am thankful for you.”

She was answering my messages after that quickly, within 10 min and sounded enthusiastic to talk to me, and suggested we go hiking with coffee saying “if you’re up for it let’s do it!” 

I replied the next day saying “Sounds fun, I could be down for that sometime 😊” keeping it cool, and she’s been radio silent since then, it’s been almost a week. And she’s been uploading songs onto her Work playlist that all have themes of a super toxic relationship that is a lot worse than ours was- all with lyrics that reflect feeling extremely hurt, betrayed, and angry and bitter which don’t reflect the tone of her message to me at all. 

But she’s also posted a bunch of songs that DO match our relationship dynamic to a T.

Idk what her relationship status is. I just know she’s a lyrics person like me. 

So I’m concluding she must be involved with someone else now from that. Am I overthinking it? She always told me how genuinely happy she was with me and was devastated when we broke up, asked me out several times over the years, which I rejected because I wasn’t ready at the time after our falling out/break up. I needed more time. Well I feel ready now and I wonder if she is preoccupied with someone else now or if I’m just reading too much into her playlist all together.

1h31f7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/KioskJournals/comments/1h31f7w/how_to_finally_start_journaling/,How to FINALLY start journaling,"Hey guys! Before I came here I was thinking: I'm inviting them to journal, but why do I journal? Well, I started to journal as I went through a storm in my life.  Some people only jot down when things are bad. I did that a lot. But I like life so much, even when I don’t like it, so I wanted to capture the good moments too.

I think a lot about the woman I will be in 6 months, a year, in 10 years. And when that woman finds this journal, I hope she learns about those bad situations, but I also hope she sees how I overcame them, so if I go through some pain again - and I will, it's part of life -, I can remind myself “well, I went through this before"". I can remind myself life is happening and I'll feel while it's happening and there's nothing wrong with that.

It’s also something similar to a support system. I step away from my feeling when I write them down. And read them. So I gather my thoughts and make sure I understand what I was saying in that paper. So I know myself better, I understand my own process. I learn better from my mistakes and from my winnings.

Now that I gave you my why, I know starting to journal can feel overwhelming—what do you write? How often? Where do you even begin?

# Here’s how to make journaling a natural and sustainable part of your daily routine:

1. **Buy yourself a journal that's going to inspire you to write**

A journal will be a written chapter of your life. So how do you want this chapter to look like? Think about that when choosing your journal. Treat yourself to a journal shopping trip, if possible, choose a pen with smooth writing, in your favorite color. Have fun with it.

2.  **Once you get your journal, start small and simple**

Start writing about your present moment. Make your first entry be focused only on the present. About today. About now. Begin with just **5 minutes**. Set a timer***.*** If you don’t know what to write about, ask yourself: “how are you?” or ""describe a thought or feeling that’s been on your mind"". Then, of course, we are here exactly to help one another, so we'll have prompts to write down.

3. **Document your entries**

What do I mean by document it? To always put the date. Always. And be as more specific as possible – write down where you are (""I'm sitting on my bed...""/""I'm in a coffee shop""). I promise you, it will make a difference! Don't forget to number your pages as you write, so you can see how many pages you have written already and be able to ask yourself ""how will my life look like in the next 50 pages?""

4. **Create your writing ritual**

I love candles. I love it. I also love those oils that smell like everything but the actual thing. That sets the mood for me. But silence to me is a MUST. You though may feel cozy with a nice lo-fi song playing, drinking some coffee (we abandoned tea here) and this is it. This is what you need to create your writing ritual. It is your time with yourself, with your thoughts and feelings, and having a moment with yourself is never a wasted moment.

5. **Read your entries often**

Once you started writing, try to read your entries often, so you can learn from your experiences, and get to know yourself better!

  
But don't forget it, journaling is a personal journey. It’s not about getting it “right” but about showing up for yourself and exploring your thoughts one word at a time. Ready to get started? ",1,1732930497.0,KioskJournals,0,1.0,False

1h31eva,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1h31eva/finding_freedom_through_open_conversations_my/,Finding Freedom Through Open Conversations: My Transformation Beyond 125 Pounds,"Hi everyone,

I never imagined that opening up about my struggles would lead me to the peace I've been seeking all along. Yet here I am, over 125 pounds lighter—not just in body, but in spirit—realizing that the hardest conversations often bring the greatest freedom.

When I began this path, I was carrying more than just extra weight. I was holding onto years of unspoken pain and hiding behind a façade of strength. Growing up, I learned to keep my struggles to myself. Vulnerability wasn't encouraged; it was seen as a weakness. So, I wore a smile and pushed through, even when I felt like I was crumbling inside.

My career mirrored this mindset. I threw myself into work, striving for success in a high-pressure environment that often left little room for authenticity. There were days I felt like just another cog in the machine, valued more for my output than for who I was as a person. It was during this time that I realized something had to change. I was living a life that looked successful on the outside but felt empty on the inside.

The turning point came when I decided to confront the truths I'd been avoiding. I began to have those difficult conversations—with myself and with others. Admitting that I needed help was one of the hardest yet most liberating decisions I've ever made. I took proactive steps by incorporating tools like Zepbound to take control of my health and embraced mental health therapy. Even though there's often a stigma surrounding medications and therapy, I realized that seeking help isn't a sign of weakness—it's a courageous step toward reclaiming meaningful life.

Sharing my experiences hasn't always been comfortable. Opening up about my struggles with weight, the emotional toll of carrying significant childhood and adulthood trauma, and the decision to use medication felt exposing. But with each conversation, I felt a weight lift2. I discovered that vulnerability isn't just about exposing wounds; it's about allowing them to heal. It connected me with others who were facing similar battles, and together, we found strength in our shared experiences.

I've learned that only through hard conversations and being open can we find the peace we've been searching for. With disclosure comes a personal freedom that's indescribable. It's about shedding the shame and embracing who we are, flaws and all. But I also want to extend grace and respect to those who aren't ready to share openly. Everyone's path is unique, and it's important to honor where you are on your journey.

Reflecting on my past, I recognize how much I've grown. There were times when I felt lost, defined by roles and expectations that didn't align with who I truly was. I remember pivotal moments—like when a simple kiss changed the trajectory of my life—that taught me about the power of authenticity and the courage it takes to pursue it. These experiences have shaped me, teaching me that vulnerability is not a weakness but a strength.

**My Progress in Numbers**

* **Starting Weight:** 360 lbs
* **Current Weight:** 235 lbs
* **Total Weight Lost:** 125 lbs
* **Body Fat Percentage:** Down from 39.4% to 30.3%
* **BMI:** From 38 (obese) to 32 (still obese, but improving)
* **Visceral Fat:** From 20 (excessive) to 14 (high, but better)

**What Helped Me Succeed**

* **Support System:** My amazing husband encouraged me through all of my self-doubt. His unwavering support has been a cornerstone of my transformation.
* **Using Zepbound:** Accepting help through medication was pivotal. Zepbound helped me rebuild my relationship with food and understand portion control.
* **Dietary Changes:**
   * **Caloric Intake:** Eating between 1,200-1,500 calories per day, focusing on whole, unprocessed foods.
   * **Hydration:** Cutting out soda and alcohol, sticking to water, black coffee, tea, and Fairlife protein shakes.
   * **Meals:** Utilizing HelloFresh for convenience and portion control, supplemented with fresh produce and veggies. Embracing comfort foods like grits in moderation.
* **Supplements:** Taking Metamucil fiber capsules and a daily multivitamin (consult your doctor for personalized advice).
* **Exercise:** Working out on the elliptical for 45 minutes, four times a week.
* **Therapy:** I have a great therapist that I see 1x per month!

**Non-Scale Victories**

* **Improved Liver Function:**
   * **AST:** Dropped from 96 to 28 (normal range: 10–40)
   * **ALT:** Dropped from 134 to 24 (normal range: 9–46)
* **Stable Blood Sugar:**
   * **Fasting Glucose:** Holding steady at 89 mg/dL (normal range: 65–99)
* **Healthy Nutrient Levels:**
   * **Vitamin D:** 47 ng/mL (optimal range: 30–100)
   * **Vitamin B12 and Folate:** Well within healthy ranges

These results are more than numbers—they're proof of healing from the inside out.

**Embracing Community and Openness**

By sharing my experiences, I've found a sense of peace I didn't know was possible. With each conversation, I felt a little freer, a little lighter. It's amazing how opening up can connect us in ways we never expected.

But I also understand that not everyone is ready to share openly, and that's perfectly okay. We all have our own timelines, and it's important to honor where each of us is on our path. If you're not ready to share your story, know that you are still a valued part of this community.

**Building a Supportive Community**

In 2025, I want to be part of building a community where hard conversations are welcomed—where we support each other without judgment and find peace through shared understanding. Let's break down stigmas, uplift one another, and create a space where everyone feels seen and heard.

**Looking Ahead**

I'm not done yet. My goals include:

* Reaching a healthy BMI
* Building muscle to support overall health
* Continuing to improve my relationship with food and myself

**Final Thoughts**

Thank you for being a part of this with me. Your support and stories inspire me every day. Together, we can embrace openness, find freedom in vulnerability, and discover the strength within us all.

I’ve built a successful business, successful investments, and worked my way up from nothing, but I understand how overwhelming it can be when you’re just starting out or maybe even feeling a bit lost in life.

I travel a lot for work, so I mostly prefer connecting online, but there may be chances for us to meet up for coffee or dinner if our paths happen to cross. What I’m really looking for is someone in the 18-24 age range who is just starting out on their own and might need guidance, someone who just wants a listening ear, or even someone who feels a bit lost and wants to talk things through with someone older for a different perspective.

Personally, I feel I connect better with females. Conversations tend to feel more natural for me, and I find it easier to build friendships without any awkwardness.

If you’re just trying to figure things out — whether it’s about finances, relationships, work, or just life in general — I’d be happy to offer advice or just listen. I’ve been through a lot, and I’m happy to share what I’ve learned. Maybe you need help making a big decision, like buying your first car or navigating a tough situation. I can be there for that too.

I’m not looking for anything romantic. Just someone who could benefit from an open, non-judgmental conversation with someone who’s been around a little longer and can offer some insight. If that sounds like it could help, feel free to reach out. I’d love to chat and see if we can work together to make life a little easier for you.

Me Sasha (33 F) have been talking to this man Bob (41 M) for almost 12 months now. I moved to his home town just over 3 months ago (Not because of him, him being here is coincidental).

For context, the whole time talking to him, I indicated and told him (Made it obvious) that I was into him and wanted to get to know him. I only got to see him 3 times the whole time of living here.  When plans were made to see each other he went full ""ghost"" mode and did not message or call to say he was busy... just nothing.

The moment I met him many months back while I was still in my previous town I liked him... a-lot and thought of him constantly (Even right now, damn-it!!). It's not often that I meet someone and they instantly have a grip of my heart...

\*We met online - dating site.

He run's his own business, so he does get busy, however his lack of effort to see me had me seriously doubting weather I should continue to talk with him. He would go weeks sometimes of not texting me then come back to say hi etc. Often left my messages on read and would often not respond.

I honestly feel that I got overly attached to a complete stranger, and feeling rather embarrassed over it!

so, moving to now... and me ending this. So, yesterday after much contemplation, I messaged him (9am) asking if he would like to meet up for a coffee or a walk. Something casual if he has free time over the weekend. He responded back with  ""are u working today"" (I said no back, having the day free to myself). Got no communication after that.

Fast forward to now, the next day. I got to a stage where I had enough. I felt emotionally drained and realised that he's just not that into me... so I messaged him: ""hey bob, this is a hard choice for me as it feels like we have been talking for a long time... but I need to cut ties :(. I don't see things moving towards anywhere meaningful. I will be removing you as a contact so that I wont be tempted to contact you again. Please don't be offended as it's nothing personal. I'll really miss talking to you. Pretty please don't message back. :(""

His response an hour later: ""you have issues. You forget that some people have two businesses to run. How about relax and stop getting offended.""

I deleted his message and hope to not hear back.

We share a group of friends, how to confess without making it awkward between us and in our shared group of friends?","I've known her since she was 12 on a new school, immediately had a crush on her. She was always in the same class as me, and we grew into the same group of friends, thus I still see her regularly. 

Over the course of our school years, she had a lot of boyfriends, none of them are similar to me in any way. This summer she broke up with her boyfriend which was her longest relationship yet (3 years), though a weird one imo, they met when she was 18, he was 31, and were together when she was 19-22, but who am I to judge.

I had a short relationship when I was 17, but it didn't feel right to me and so it didn't last long, since then I've been single, I don't meet a lot of new people, I usually only go out with my friends, including her.

It's just impossible for me to get over her, I'm a bit drunk typing this, but I just saw her after not having seen her for 2 months since we're both busy with bachelors/masters thesis, and my crush on her has just been reaffirmed once again. There were often periods where we didn't see each other for weeks/months, and then seeing her again always got my heart racing so bad, just like this night. 

She's going away for 3 months to South-America and gave a goodbye party, so I had to see her obviously, we hugged and talked a lot and my heart was racing. Every time I meet her, it's like seeing her for the first time again and my crush on her gets stronger.

But clearly I'm very different from the type of guys she's had relationships with, she loves folks music and all her relationships have been with artistic musicians, I'm just a physics nerd that likes staring at stars.

I never confessed to a girl, my first short relationship was the girl confessing to me. I want to confess to her so badly before or after she goes to South-America, but at the same time, I feel like it could not only ruin our friendship, but also make it awkward in our group of friends (8 friends). We've been friends for 11 years, but no one ever had a relationship with someone else in our group of friends.

I don't think I could ever move on from her, unless I stumble into a relationship with another girl, but my heart kinda only beats for her at the moment, and for most of the past 11 years. 

She leaves in a week, since I was the only one of our shared group of friends coming to her goodbye party, she said she wanted to have a coffee with me and maybe the others as well, but she was kinda mad at them for not coming, do probably just with me (though I have to admit, her party was short-notice, only half a day in advance). But that got my heart racing as well, since it sounds like a date...

How do I approach my situation? I don't know how to confess to a girl, I don't want to make things awkward in our group of friends, but yet I can't move on from her, I tried, but here we still are 11 years later, still a crush on the same girl as when I was 12.


TL;DR: I have a crush on a girl, who's also been a good friend of me for 11 years, we share the same group of friends. I can't move on from her, as I've had a crush on her for 11 years, every time I see her the crush gets stronger.

It’s a 1,000-mile Andean marathon with countless passes over 16,000 ft in elevation.

Services faded toward nonexistence as the cold grew increasingly severe. Remote villages might have one tiendita and one comedor, otherwise you’d be lucky to pass through any given town on the same day as the vegetable truck. Atop each mountain waited torrential blizzards of horizontal snow and hail, with shards of ice collecting on my tent by morning.

Just beyond Oyon I reached the new highest pass of my life: +16,300ft [4,968m]. Locals here blockaded the road in protest against mining activity, so the peak had been subsequently abandoned. I’d prepared for the cold weather, but even after months across the Andes these extreme elevations devoured my strength. It took everything I had to haul my bike over the makeshift stone walls and continue down the other side.

Daylight cratered fast as I raced downhill each afternoon, but the colors up top were what struck me the most. Some peaks were sage green, some were the darkest shade of red wine, others a liquid type of orange, all ribboned with veils of ice and snow that hardly ever melt away.",11,1732929245.0,PERU,0,0.92,False
1h310nl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1h310nl/a_dallas_natives_review_of_nyc/,A Dallas native's review of NYC,"Hello fellow New Yorkers! My name is ChanceTurbo. I am an artist, composer, and school teacher. I am born and raised here in Dallas my whole life. I am 33 today. I finally had a chance to visit the big Apple, as I have always wanted to see it.

I really don't know who this is for. Maybe if anyone on here is curious to know an outsiders perspective on the city. Maybe some of you don't know how truly amazing your city really is, and how unbelievably jealous I am of you. Logic is, if this is a valuable read to anyone on the subway or whenever during your busy day, it's worth posting. 

If no one here has ever been to Dallas before, someone described it on here very well a few years ago. A corporate wasteland. Dallas really fucked up their city without building any shops at the base of any of the buildings downtown, making walking around downtown basically useless. All of down town is almost no residential, and almost entirely all office space, forcing people to live outside the city and commute into work via cars, traffic and highways. Texas as a whole has a deregulated market too, which basically eliminated most of the mom and pop shops, and made all of our shopping large chains. The city is surrounded by suburbs in all directions. 

Growing up in the suburbs, I always had a fascination with the urban life style. Texas really seeds home and car ownership as a value into its youth. I always saw that as a means to an end. If space is what you desire, then you will never have enough. But I have always loved big cities, massive human structures. Ever since I was little. 

I flew into legardia, took the q70 to Roosevelt, and then the r to time square. I popped up out of the ground on to time square at about 9:30 pm on a Sunday Night. BLOWN. AWAY. The lights, the height of the buildings, the construction, the steam coming out of the ground. All the little shops everywhere. The food carts. The amount of people that were outside. It was completely overwhelming. 

I was stopped at an intersection because of the traffic light just looking up in aw. Everyone was passing me like an I was an idiot waiting for the walking light to appear. I grabbed pizza, and was eating it on the way to pen station to pick up my friend. I was listening to the metro boomin spiderman soundtrack on my phone walking the streets of Manhattan as cringy as that is. I had visible tears streaming down my face toward the brightest smile I have ever had in my life. 

We spent the next two days seeing Manhattan, and Brooklyn. We walked 100000 steps across three days. We got utopia bagels one morning, watched a gay and black barista at Starbucks scream at a homeless man for blasting the toilet everyday right in front of everyone in the store. Everyone just watched and then went back to drinking coffee. Ate artichoke pizza one night. Went to 230 rooftop. Went ice skating in Bryant Park. Tried no chewing allowed hot chocolate. Kenka in east village was amazing. Walked the highline on the last day. Heard new yorkers pointing out jersey license plates and making fun of them for not being able to drive.  Checked out a drag show at joy face.  Friends making fun of me the whole time because I was a 33 year old man making faces like a small child in aw at literally everything I saw. I was amazed at the stupidist things, like steam coming out of the ground. Central Park was a surreal experience and so much more charming in real life than the movies. China Town was unbelievable. The dumpling shop in the abandoned mall. A woman yelled at me for standing in front of the subway doors like a moron. Even the negative experiences I had in New York were positives for me. 

By the time the 3rd day hit, the pre sadness started to hit me. I knew returning home was going to hurt. I have never loved a place so much in my entire life. I was worried visiting New York would hurt, as I was afraid it would ruin my home, and it did. I never wanted to leave city. 

Prior to coming to New York, there was always the question of, do I actually love the urban life style, or was I just super facially attracted to it. I learned that I am in fact the first option, and I can't ignore after getting to finally taste it. I loved being able to walk and take the subway everywhere. I fucking hate driving. I have always thought cars and driving is stupid.  I got to see the urban tiny apartments, as my friend showed me her place. I loved it. I love the efficiency of maxing out the space you have. I love being surrounded by everyone. I love all those damn buildings. I loved all the damn musicians in the streets. 

I'm a damn musician. I know exactly what music is for. We all live busy and difficult lives. We take the few minutes we have every day to just escape into our minds with the songs we love. That's the power of music, and that's why we listen. I want to be  down on the streets surrounded by those people on the same level ground. I want to be surrounded by everyone that I make music for, and I have never felt that in Dallas, and I felt it in a abundance in NYC. 

Moving to Nyc will be challenging for me. I have a degree in media/videography, and a teaching license. New York makes it really hard to teach there, as they require a masters, and I know media is extremely competitive in the city, so I really don't have a clear path in. I'm not exactly young anymore. I am not opposed to making another career change to something that would make it easier to move into the city, but it would be awkward doing that in my mid 30s after career changing once already. I'm living in this weird pain, that I know for a fact I'll never reach my full happiness unless I move into the city and that there is also a very real chance that I might never get to. 

I'm literally wheeping like a little girl writing this out on the plane. I don't even want to shower when I get home because I can still smell New York on my cloths. I bought a little NYC snow globe at one of the gift shops to keep on my desk at school to remind me of the city, but I might not be able to do that because it will just make me sad. You all have the greatest city on the God damn planet, and I cannot with words express how jealous I am of every single one of you that gets to call new York home. We might have passed each other in Manhattan, Brooklyn, or on the subway. I was wearing a bright yellow jacket and probably smiling. Thank you for helping make New York the most amazing place I have ever been in my life. Enjoy the city. 

Tldr: NYC is greatest place on planet earth.

Sometimes I play it safe with water, but my favourite would be a nice beer, when I'm in the mood for a little drink.

1h30yso,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h30yso,Keyball61 review,"

Let me preface this by saying that I like keyboards, but I don't understand them to a great extent. I've built a couple (tofu v2, mode envoy, bakeneko for a friend) but I'm not savvy with GitHub and haven't created my own firmware.

Some unfortunate but funny things happened:

This board took about 2.5 weeks from purchasing to ship to the USA. I bought this prebuilt as I felt tired of monkeying around with boards. When it arrived, it everything looked so sleek, but the trackball case was warped. I reached out to the HolyKeebs discord moderator, and they were able to issue a new trackball case. 

Unfortunately, they didn't have black in stock at this time, so it took about 3 weeks to come back in stock and another 2 weeks to arrive. In the meantime, I managed to break the already warped trackball case by trying to hand squeeze it into shape. This shattered into 3 pieces. I also happened to lose the 3 ceramic bearings during The Shattering. I was able to superglue the case back together, find all itty-bitty bearings in my patterned rug, and re-insert them into place with a little masking tape, luck, and tweezers. 

When the second trackball case arrived, I was ecstatic, but this was short lived as this was also warped. To HolyKeebs credit, this thing was wrapped up in tons of bubble wrap and packing peanuts; looked like a toddler in snow gear. I showed a pic to the HolyKeebs moderator, and they offered to send in a white case (apparently stronger material). I used some woodworking clamps to mold it into shape, which took a total of 24 hours. 

All this to say, shit still happens with prebuilts and having honest consistent communication/help from the makers in these situations is invaluable.

  
Experience: (4 months, first ergo so I can only speak to a few attributes).

Materials:

I bought the printed case and the acrylic bottom plate as I couldn't choose when ordering. I liked the lower profile with the acrylic case, but the printed case makes it look more complete imo, and its still low profile but just chunkier along the edges. The Tai-Hao Thins Black keycaps are low profile and quite fashionable; I like how they line up within the printed case. They have a little layer of shine that's been built on them. 

Weight:

261.2g on the trackball side (with ball) / 233g non-trackball. Is this important? Who knows. 

Construction:

It's light, but it doesn't feel flimsy by any means.  It's a compact and intentional design. I would love if there was a case that existed to carry this around, but due to the trackball case profile, I wouldn't say this is a very portable option for a keyboard. 

The only real (and very small) issues I have with this board is the type of screws provided. I just prefer Phillips type screws and wish that this was standardized amongst the hobby. The second, is where the TRRS ports are located. I like to have a notepad or coffee between the board, and the cable just feels a bit in the way. I have plans for a better looking and longer cable, so this should mitigate this to a degree. The third, is the TRRS cable provided should be compatible with the printed case they sell with the KeyBall. It's difficult to tell by the photo but the TRRS cable provided butts up against the case in an awkward way; it still works as it should, but it's not ideal. 

Software:

I can only speak to this briefly, but I liked the profile the keyboard comes with for accessing layers. I wish I was a little less lazy so that I could make my own macros, but the REMAP site has enough for me to get by with what I need and was easy to use.

Personal Experience:

I'm familiar with 65% boards, that are full of foam, lubed switches, and very much tailored to manufacturing a great sound and typing feel. Comparing this board to those feels like comparing two different values. At this point, what I'm looking for is comfort and efficiency than anything, but I also don't want it to look butt ugly. ^(Sorry dactyl lovers.)

Personally, I've had more discomfort in both my wrists and shoulders, and I think this is due to both my typing and physical posture. I work completely remote, so I bought a better chair and keyboard I thought would ultimately help, but what I did not expect was to *not* feel any type of discomfort, which is where I'm ultimately at. I've used this keyboard every day and I love it. It works for me. So much so, that I don't use my other keyboards. I'm not saying that this is the solution to pain/discomfort, but it has helped me tremendously and I'm curious to hear if there's anyone that has more stories like this.

  
Layout/sizing:

I like how the rows and columns are laid out. It took me about 2 days to get used to the locations of ""x,c,v, and b"" but overall, it feels very natural to type on. My typing speed has decreased, but only marginally. Nor do I really care in the grand scheme of things.

The trackball is obviously a huge selling point for this board, but I was very much concerned with my thumb getting stuck between keys or moving inorganically but the trackball location could not be in a better location. I have medium to large hands and this board feels 

 If I could redo this purchase, I think I would get a smaller version of the board. I was very worried to switch to ergo *and* drop down in keys, but I would say that I use around 40ish keys (I use a keypad as well), but that would involve programming which is just daunting to me. ^(If you couldn't tell..)

  
Very subjective pros/cons:

Pros:

* Easy assembly (based on videos/and reading the instructions... grain of salt on this one).
* Looks incredible
* functional
* anti-fatigue
* great customer service
* the trackball and thumb cluster locations!
* natural feel
* Unique

Cons:

* TRRS cable location 
* Learning Curve
* portability
* Unique?

Below is based on my shallow ""yet"" knowledge so please correct me if I am wrong.

I am exploring the bean we use and found out the way previous barista made coffee can be improved.

  
Long story short, I wanna know if there's any other way to make coffee tastier.

* **Coffee bean used : blend, mid roasted with dark cocoa note**
* **Dosage : 20.5g - double shot** 

 \> Extraction time : 27\~30s

 \> Yield : *1:3\~3.5 yield* (for double shot expresso button) which is a lungo,

and it tastes really bitter and meh as espresso and bland as latte.



So I changed the yield by using the ristretto button with same dosage and it gives :

\> Extraction time : 15\~17s

\> Yield : 1:1\~1.5 yield (for double shot ristretto button) which gives an espresso.

AND IT TASTES SO MUCH BETTER, not sure if I can make it even better cause no time yet to explore :<

  
Do you think there's a better way to make coffee better, and is it okay to make this yield for this short extraction time? 

Does ristretto button have different pressure compared to espresso or it depends on the setting?

I am not sure how to check setting of the machine yet.

I’m in my early twenties and I do not have a good relationship with my dad. My therapist has said he’s likely a narcissist with a savior complex, and he and my mom split up a few years ago after he repeatedly cheated on her. 
My dad has always kind of used me as his excuse as to why life isn’t working out for him, and it got worse after he and my mom split up. 
A few years ago he started dating this woman (let’s call her Debbie) and she is kind of off. I thought she was just kind of quirky at first and I tried really hard to like her. I made an effort to involve her in family activities, but she just always seemed like she didn’t really like me. Again, I chalked it up to maybe her just being awkward. 

A couple years ago my dad cheated on Debbie. I felt fucking horrible for her, as my dad is a serial cheater, and I’m the one who found the messages between him and another married woman because they were open on the family computer when I still lived at home. 
I sent her the photos of the screen (not screenshots that is important), because girl code. I even offered to bring her by some coffee the next morning and was planning to get her flowers when she blew up on me saying I photoshopped the messages. 
I know it’s easy to fake screenshots with different apps and generators but I have absolutely no clue how to photoshop stuff like that. Anyone who knows me can attest to the fact that I’m kind of technologically challenged. 
She called me crazy and told me I needed to get help mentally. 
My response was something along the line of “believe what you want, I did my best to help you.”
She didn’t apologize to me for this until a year after when my dad forced her to because I had clearly stopped attempting to build a relationship with her. 
Cut to this year, they’re engaged now. I had cut contact with my dad for a week or so because he had screamed at my brother for needing a ride home from work early (he doesn’t have a license and had recently had a seizure so he couldn’t walk in the extreme heat that was going on in August) and so I yelled at him. 
I honestly freaked the fuck out. I yelled at him which maybe wasn’t the right way to go about it. I told him he’s abusive and that the things going badly for him are karma for the way he’s always treated our family. (The abuse wasn’t always just emotional, some of it was physical and he refuses to take accountability for it). I was at my breaking point. I returned the phone of mine he paid for and I got on my own plan because I didn’t want him holding anything over my head anymore. 
For a little bit of background, when my dad loses control of people or a situation he has a history of threatening to kill himself. He used to gaslight me out of calling for emergency help when he’d do it saying that I’d ruin his career and would break up our family. 
This time, my brother was the only one living in the house and he called me terrified while I could hear my dad screaming at him in the background. He was yelling about wanting to kill himself and kept telling my brother he didn’t actually love him (all of this because we had been giving my brother rides to work so he didn’t have to rely on my dad). In pure panic for both my brothers safety, and my dad’s, I called the police. I raced over to the house and met them there, where my brother packed a bag and came to live with me until my mom had his room ready for him at her place. 
He screamed at the cops and kept trying to say they were there to hurt him (because they had non-lethal weapons on them. Legit it was a taser.)
That night I called Debbie to let her know what had happened so she wasn’t left out of the loop, and when she answered the conversation went as follows as exact as I can get it.
Me: “hey, Debbie have you heard from my dad? I didn’t know if you’d heard anything about tonight.”
Debbie: “I did, and you know what? I’ve been doing my best to help your dad while he’s having a rough time and you just had to ruin it.”
Me: “excuse me?”
Debbie: “you and your mom get to threaten suicide all you want and nobody calls the cops on you! This is all your fault”
Me: “you’re a cunt and you deserve each other”
I then hung up the phone

To clarify: I have had suicidal behavior in the past when I was in high school and even semi recent as I have extreme OCD and BPD. However, I’ve been in therapy for years and literally everyone in my family tells me on a regular basis that they can tell I’m putting in the work. I used to be a volatile person, but I’m not anymore because I’ve done a ton of work in therapy to change that. I don’t have anger outbursts anymore and I’m a lot more aware of when an episode is coming on so I’m able to avoid it. I’ve never threatened suicide, all I have done is go to the hospital when I felt suicidal so that I could be taken care of by professionals.  When it comes to my mom, after my dad cheated on her she went through a phase of alcoholism and suicidal behavior because the man she’d spent decades with had blown up her entire life. When my mom threatened suicide, we called the cops on her. We also met with her entire family about her alcoholism and she’s been in recovery for nearly two years. 

I told my dad what she said and he said he would talk to her. I have not received an apology from either of them, and my dad says I need to just forgive her because she was worried about him. He even says I should apologize for calling her a name.
I am of the opinion that this is a pattern of behavior. She’s been awful to me before, and she continues to treat me with disrespect. She doesn’t think she has a reason to apologize after literally telling me that it’s my fault my dad was threatening to kill himself. I refuse to forgive her especially when there’s been no apology for her behavior. I told him I’m not going to his wedding and that I’m not going to Christmas because she will be there. I have also told my dad that I don’t want him talking to me anymore if he isn’t willing to stand up for me. 

I’m sorry if any of this is confusing, I’m willing to clarify anything that may not be clear. There are some things I’m keeping out of this just so nobody finds out who my dad is. After all this shit I still don’t want him hurt by this. 
I just want to know if I’m overreacting, and if I should just forgive her and move on… or if I’m justified. ",2,1732928494.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

They come from the same litter and are about 6 years old now. They're indoor/outdoor cats and we've never really had an issue with them being aggressive with each other except on rare occurrences. However we're noticing a bigger and bigger issue when it come to territory in the house. While they aren't aggressive there is a clear demarcation line between the two. One cat (Coffee), who spends most of her time upstairs, has what we think is a food domination, the other cat (Kit) is unlikely to eat at the same time as Coffee. By separating their food dishes further apart we seemed to have mostly solved that issue as long as Coffee's dish is filled first (she's a little eager when it comes to food, so she's quicker to the dishes when they're being fed). The real problem is with the litter. We keep it downstairs which is commonly where you'll kind Kit. Coffee has an ongoing issue with shitting in the same room we feed them in and this week has peed on the kitchen counter twice, both upstairs. We've noticed a handful of altercations between the two when it comes to litter and we're just trying to get some advice on how to get both of these cats at least using one of the litter boxes we have in the same room.",2,1732928297.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False

i’ve spent the past three weeks building a product and i’m getting ready to launch this weekend!

no real coding experience. no product validation. just a lot of coffee and determination.

it all started when i landed my first consulting client. my background is in ops—i worked as a founder's associate for a scaling b2b saas. my job? find the biggest problem the company was facing, figure out a solution, and build systems to fix it.

fast forward to a chat with a friend. he’s a business coach and ghostwriter for linkedin clients. turns out he was spending hours every week writing content for them. so, i did what i do best: built a system. i used airtable and make to create something that could generate content in their brand voice, complete with templates for specific formats.

he loved it. in fact, he loved it so much he wanted me to implement it for his clients too.

awesome, right? well, not exactly.

i had two options:

1. build the system on their airtable accounts, which meant manually updating each instance if i wanted to make changes (a total nightmare for scalability).


2. host everything on my airtable and pay airtable a cut of the income, which would eat into my profit margins big time.



neither felt right.

then i came across cursor. wow. just... wow.

with my very basic coding skills (think: a few no-code projects and a lot of googling), i’ve managed to build an mvp in just three weeks. it’s insane how accessible building something like this is now.

launching this weekend (fingers crossed!). still got a few things to sort out:

making the ui more intuitive

figuring out the pricing model

sorting deployment (not gonna lie, this one’s stressing me out a bit)


that’s it though. no promo, no sales pitch, just genuinely pumped to see where this goes. wish me luck! 😅

1h30nc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYStateOfMind/comments/1h30nc4/a_dallas_natives_review_of_nyc/,A Dallas natives review of NYC,"Hello fellow New Yorkers! My name is ChanceTurbo. I am an artist, composer, and school teacher. I am born and raised here in Dallas my whole life. I am 33 today. I finally had a chance to visit the big Apple, as I have always wanted to see it.

I really don't know who this is for. Maybe if anyone on here is curious to know an outsiders perspective on the city. Maybe some of you don't know how truly amazing your city really is, and how unbelievably jealous I am of you. Logic is, if this is a valuable read to anyone on the subway or whenever during your busy day, it's worth posting. 

If no one here has ever been to Dallas before, someone described it on here very well a few years ago. A corporate wasteland. Dallas really fucked up their city without building any shops at the base of any of the buildings downtown, making walking around downtown basically useless. All of down town is almost no residential, and almost entirely all office space, forcing people to live outside the city and commute into work via cars, traffic and highways. Texas as a whole has a deregulated market too, which basically eliminated most of the mom and pop shops, and made all of our shopping large chains. The city is surrounded by suburbs in all directions. 

Growing up in the suburbs, I always had a fascination with the urban life style. Texas really seeds home and car ownership as a value into its youth. I always saw that as a means to an end. If space is what you desire, then you will never have enough. But I have always loved big cities, massive human structures. Ever since I was little. 

I flew into legardia, took the q70 to Roosevelt, and then the r to time square. I popped up out of the ground on to time square at about 9:30 pm on a Sunday Night. BLOWN. AWAY. The lights, the height of the buildings, the construction, the steam coming out of the ground. All the little shops everywhere. The food carts. The amount of people that were outside. It was completely overwhelming. 

I was stopped at an intersection because of the traffic light just looking up in aw. Everyone was passing me like an I was an idiot waiting for the walking light to appear. I grabbed pizza, and was eating it on the way to pen station to pick up my friend. I was listening to the metro boomin spiderman soundtrack on my phone walking the streets of Manhattan as cringy as that is. I had visible tears streaming down my face toward the brightest smile I have ever had in my life. 

We spent the next two days seeing Manhattan, and Brooklyn. We walked 100000 steps across three days. We got utopia bagels one morning, watched a gay and black barista at Starbucks scream at a homeless man for blasting the toilet everyday right in front of everyone in the store. Everyone just watched and then went back to drinking coffee. Ate artichoke pizza one night. Went to 230 rooftop. Went ice skating in Bryant Park. Tried no chewing allowed hot chocolate. Kenka in east village was amazing. Walked the highline on the last day. Heard new yorkers pointing out jersey license plates and making fun of them for not being able to drive.  Checked out a drag show at joy face.  Friends making fun of me the whole time because I was a 33 year old man making faces like a small child in aw at literally everything I saw. I was amazed at the stupidist things, like steam coming out of the ground. Central Park was a surreal experience and so much more charming in real life than the movies. China Town was unbelievable. The dumpling shop in the abandoned mall. A woman yelled at me for standing in front of the subway doors like a moron. Even the negative experiences I had in New York were positives for me. 

By the time the 3rd day hit, the pre sadness started to hit me. I knew returning home was going to hurt. I have never loved a place so much in my entire life. I was worried visiting New York would hurt, as I was afraid it would ruin my home, and it did. I never wanted to leave city. 

Prior to coming to New York, there was always the question of, do I actually love the urban life style, or was I just super facially attracted to it. I learned that I am in fact the first option, and I can't ignore after getting to finally taste it. I loved being able to walk and take the subway everywhere. I fucking hate driving. I have always thought cars and driving is stupid.  I got to see the urban tiny apartments, as my friend showed me her place. I loved it. I love the efficiency of maxing out the space you have. I love being surrounded by everyone. I love all those damn buildings. I loved all the damn musicians in the streets. 

I'm a damn musician. I know exactly what music is for. We all live busy and difficult lives. We take the few minutes we have every day to just escape into our minds with the songs we love. That's the power of music, and that's why we listen. I want to be  down on the streets surrounded by those people on the same level ground. I want to be surrounded by everyone that I make music for, and I have never felt that in Dallas, and I felt it in a abundance in NYC. 

Moving to Nyc will be challenging for me. I have a degree in media/videography, and a teaching license. New York makes it really hard to teach there, as they require a masters, and I know media is extremely competitive in the city, so I really don't have a clear path in. I'm not exactly young anymore. I am not opposed to making another career change to something that would make it easier to move into the city, but it would be awkward doing that in my mid 30s after career changing once already. I'm living in this weird pain, that I know for a fact I'll never reach my full happiness unless I move into the city and that there is also a very real chance that I might never get to. 

I'm literally wheeping like a little girl writing this out on the plane. I don't even want to shower when I get home because I can still smell New York on my cloths. I bought a little NYC snow globe at one of the gift shops to keep on my desk at school to remind me of the city, but I might not be able to do that because it will just make me sad. You all have the greatest city on the God damn planet, and I cannot with words express how jealous I am of every single one of you that gets to call new York home. We might have passed each other in Manhattan, Brooklyn, or on the subway. I was wearing a bright yellow jacket and probably smiling. Thank you for helping make New York the most amazing place I have ever been in my life. Enjoy the city. 

Tldr: NYC is greatest place on planet earth.
