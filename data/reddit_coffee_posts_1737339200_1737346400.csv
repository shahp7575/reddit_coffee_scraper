1i5hqwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i5hqwq/im_a_cripple_creek_co_rapper_who_works_at_a/,"I'm a Cripple Creek, CO Rapper Who Works At a Haunted Roadside Inn. I Dissed a Murderous Gangsta Rapper. Both Want Me Dead. ","There’s a thin line between being an underground rapper on the come-up and being a broke-ass loser talking shit on the internet.

Unfortunately, I’ve spent most of my career firmly in the **latter** category. Which is why, when I say that the dumbest thing I’ve ever done started with **one tweet**, I need you to understand the weight of that.

Because I should have known better.

I work at **The Rusty Key Inn,** which is a rotting corpse of a roadside motel, held together by bad decisions, nicotine stains, and the stubborn refusal of the owner, **Old Man Clyde,** to admit the place should have been condemned twenty years ago. Clyde is my boss. Kind of.

He was also a former blues musician, a cryptic old bastard, and a man who has attempted to chain-smoke and drink his way to an early death...but is somehow still kicking.

I work the night shift.

Which means I spend most of my time sitting at the front desk, drinking stale coffee, and trying to ignore the fact that this place is absolutely haunted. Oh, and writing rhymes.

Tonight was no different. Until I found the journal...

Cleaning staff hate Room 3. Not because it’s dirty—but because every time they clean it, something changes overnight.

**Furniture moved.**

**Drawers rearranged.**

**Lights turned on by themselves.**

That’s why, when a guest left a notebook behind in there, they refused to touch it. I found it sitting dead center on the nightstand, the cover open to a half-ripped page. The handwriting was erratic, scrawled like someone was in a hurry—or panicking.

**DO NOT LISTEN TO THE SIGNALS.**

**DO NOT GO TO THE BASEMENT.**

**STAY AWAY FROM THE MINES.**

I shivered. Then I turned the page.

**JANUARY 27TH**

**IT ALWAYS HAPPENS AGAIN**

My stomach dropped. Because that’s **today’s date.**

Look, I’m **NOT** the smartest guy alive. But if a guest’s creepy journal tells you not to go to the basement, what’s the first thing any normal person would do?

*Exactly.*

**Go directly to the basement.**

I shouldn’t have. The lights didn’t work right down there. Everything is too quiet.

I was about to turn back when I noticed something sitting on a shelf, half-hidden behind a stack of old linens. A dusty, taxidermy parrot, perched on a wooden stand. Its eyes were glass, its feathers moth-eaten and brittle. I don’t know why, but I reached out and touched it. The moment my fingers brushed the beak, the thing spoke.

In Clyde’s voice.

**""Ain't no second chances, kid.""**

I nearly shit myself.

I spun around. Clyde wasn’t there. The parrot’s beak hadn’t moved. Did I mention the parrot had a pirate hat? It had a pirate hat. And an eye patch.

But before I could even process it—there was a click. And then—a hidden door slid open in the basement wall.

Behind it was something I was never meant to find. The room smelled like old paper and static electricity.

Inside, under a thick layer of dust and neglect, sat a fully operational pirate radio station.

**An ancient mixing board.**

**A rusted microphone.**

**A reel-to-reel tape deck—running, even though it wasn’t plugged in.**

I took a step forward. A voice came through.

My voice.

Then the recording cut off. And a new voice came through.

Not mine. Something deeper, layered in static and something almost… alive.

Then—knocking.

From inside the walls.

I ran.

**The next night,** I was at **The Howling Hound** downing beers with **Todd** and **Chris**. **Big Ray** was the owner of the bar, and he still talked like every conversation was being recorded for a pay-per-view event.

“You boys out here lookin’ like JOBBERS tonight,” Big Ray boomed, slamming down a beer in front of Elan. “You gotta walk in with **PRESENCE**. With **INTENTION**. A **LEGEND** doesn’t just **EXIST**—he makes the world **NOTICE**.”

I rubbed my temples. “Ray, I don’t know what half those words mean in this context.”

Big Ray leaned in, deadly serious. “That’s ‘cause you **AIN’T LIVIN’ ‘EM**.”

I sighed. “I don’t have time for philosophy from a guy who once claimed he ***suplexed Bigfoot*****.**”

Big Ray slammed a fist on the table. “**CLAIMED?! I DID SUPLEX BIGFOOT.**""

This was the dynamic. Always. And normally? It was fine. But tonight, I was fucking stressed.

**Chris**, our manager, was lecturing me about my life choices. **Marcus**—my hype man, **aka ""Hung Tongue""**—had just gotten arrested for selling fake Rolexes to an undercover cop. **Todd (aka ""Trackmaster Todd""**), our resident conspiracy theorist DJ, was encouraging my worst instincts. We call our group **THE BLIZZARD BOYS**. And now we needed money to get Marcus out of jail.

“You could always start a beef with a famous rapper,” Todd joked.

I blinked.

Marcus, who'd called from county jail on speakerphone to tell us he'd been arrested, perked up immediately.

“Wait. Hold up. That’s actually genius.”

Chris groaned.

“No. No. Absolutely fucking not.”

But I wasn’t listening. Because **I already didn’t like Warcloud.**

Warcloud is a **real** gangster.

Like, **alleged bodies, confirmed felonies, don’t-fuck-with-him gangster.** But as a rapper?

**Garbage.**

His flow is choppy, his bars are weak, and half his songs end mid-sentence like he just gave up halfway through.

And that’s exactly what I tweeted.

EZ$ @EZMoneyRapGod

**""Crazy how some of these rappers out here got bodies but not a single bar to their name.""**

Marcus, still on speakerphone, yelled “DO IT” from the jail phone.

Todd whispered, **“Make it worse.”**

So I did.

EZ$ @EZMoneyRapGod

**I’m talking about you**, @RealWarcloud. **Y’all love this man but let’s be real, half his verses sound like he had a stroke mid-bar.""**

Chris put his head in his hands.

“You **want** to die, don’t you?”

I sat back, satisfied.

“It’s fine. He’s not gonna see it.”

Then—the jukebox cut out.

For five full seconds, the bar was silent, except for a strange hissing static crackling through the speakers.

And then—Big Ray, without missing a beat, said: “That’s the signals.”

I opened my mouth.

I *almost* told him. Almost told him about the basement. About the journal. About **the radio station that shouldn’t exist**. But at that moment, I said nothing.

We were halfway home when the streetlights flickered.

At the edge of the parking lot, standing just outside the glow of the last street lamp, was **an ancient looking man holding a lantern**. He was still as a statue. His clothes were old, covered in dust, like he’d stepped out of another century. And the light in his lantern didn’t flicker. It just… glowed. Steady. Sickly yellow. Like it wasn’t a flame at all. My stomach dropped.

And then the stars disappeared.

The entire sky went black, like someone had thrown a switch. Todd froze beside me.

Chris whispered, “*What the fuck?”*

We all stood there, silent, not breathing. Then, just as suddenly as it happened— the streetlights buzzed back on.

The stars were back.

And **the Lantern Man?**

Gone.

Todd spoke first.

**“We’re not talking about this.”**

Chris nodded immediately. “**Agreed**.”

I exhaled. **“Yeah. Definitely.”**

We started walking again, faster this time. None of us looked back.

**THE NEXT MORNING**

I wasn’t hungover. Not exactly. But my brain felt like it had been left on a low-volume static channel all night. I barely slept. Between the tweets at Warcloud, Marcus still being in jail, and whatever the fuck happened in the basement, I had too much noise in my head. And I hadn’t even asked the worst question yet...

I wasn’t supposed to be at the Rusty Key Inn until my night shift, but Clyde had finally written out the paychecks, and if I didn’t pick mine up now, I’d probably never see it. Clyde had a habit of losing important things—like time, keys, and basic human empathy—so the safest move was to get my money before he forgot where he put it.

When I walked into the lobby, Clyde was sitting behind the desk, chain-smoking like he was trying to kill whatever part of himself was still alive.

“Morning, kid.” He took a long drag, then stubbed his cigarette out in a coffee mug that definitely didn’t contain coffee.

I hesitated. This was not the kind of guy who responded well to direct questions. But I had to ask.

“So…” I leaned against the counter. “You ever hear about a **pirate radio station** in the basement?”

Clyde blinked. “**Basement’s closed**.”

“That wasn’t my question.”

He scratched his chin. “We don’t **got** a pirate radio station.”

I crossed my arms. “Then what the fuck is **all that equipment down there**?”

He let out a long, slow breath.

“Son,” he said, “you ever been out to the woods at night?”

I frowned. “What?”

“You ever hear a sound, and you ain’t sure if it’s a bird or somethin’ else?”

I hesitated.

Clyde nodded. “That’s the thing about signals. You don’t **gotta** understand ‘em to hear ‘em.”

He stood up, tapped his half-burnt cigarette against the desk.

“**You keep your ass outta that basement.**”

Then he walked off like that was the end of the conversation.

**Marcus called 20 minutes later.** I put him on speaker.

""Bro,"" he said, ""you gotta get me out. This is inhumane. I had to **shit in front of another man**.""

Chris sighed. “Marcus. You were selling fake Rolexes to an undercover cop.”

“How was I supposed to know he was a cop?!""

""He was wearing a badge.""

""A lot of people wear badges, Chris!""

Todd nodded solemnly. ""That’s true. Some of them aren’t even real cops.""

Chris turned to me. “So. What’s the plan? Because bail ain’t free.”

I exhaled. “I’m working on it.”

Which is when I remembered **Big Ray’s offer.**

The Howling Hound was having a little problem with some pencil-pushing city council asshole from Town Hall who was trying to **get the bar shut down**.

Ray needed someone to handle it.

Not with violence—just something petty, humiliating, and perfectly timed.

And if we pulled it off, Ray would help with Marcus’ bail.

So we started plotting...

**LATER THAT EVENING**

Around 3 AM, the old 1970s radio behind the desk crackled to life. Even though \*it wasn’t plugged in.\*

***""You’re listening to KCRP, the high-altitude heartbeat of Cripple Creek!""***

I froze.

***""Tonight’s topic? Strange happenings in our little town.""***

I didn’t move.

Because I knew this wasn’t live.

This was decades old.

***""Ain’t nothin’ new, folks.*****""** The DJ chuckled. ***""You’ve seen the Lantern Man. You’ve heard the whispers. You know about the mines.""***

I swallowed.

Then he said, **“January 27th.”**

I flinched.

That was today.

The static warped.

Then a new voice layered over the broadcast.

**“Elan.""**

My breath hitched. The radio crackled.

**“Are you listening?""**

The lights flickered. The air felt thick, wrong, charged with static. And then the power cut out. Total darkness. For a second, I thought I saw someone standing in the reflection of the motel lobby window.

Tall. Flickering like bad reception.

Then the lights snapped back on. And the radio was off.

**THE NEXT DAY**

I barely slept. When I got to work the next evening, the housekeeping staff was uneasy. One of them—Maria, who had been working here longer than Clyde had owned the place—pulled me aside.

“Hey. That trucker that you checked into Room 6?”

I nodded. “Yeah?”

Maria hesitated.

**“Did you see him leave?”**

I frowned. “Only when he checked in...”

She nodded. “Room’s untouched. Sheets still tucked. Shower’s dry. Mint on the pillow's still there. Nothing disturbed. But the radio was on, just playing static.”

I swallowed. I had checked him in. I had taken his cash. And then? Nothing.

Maria exhaled. **“I don’t like it.”**

She walked off.

I didn’t tell her about the radio broadcast the night before. Because I didn’t know how to explain it. And even if I did? **I didn’t think I wanted to say it out loud.**



Tina is one of the Rusty Key’s most loyal customers. Not because she paid for rooms, but because she was always around, hanging out in the parking lot or bumming smokes off guests. The inn was cheap, full of weirdos, and had no cameras, which made it perfect for her, uh, lifestyle.

Tonight, she had found herself a biker. The guy looked like he had been in a bar fight sometime in the last 48 hours and probably lost.

He threw some crumpled-up bills on the counter. “Room for the night.”

Tina winked at me as they took the key.

“You need anything, I’ll be in Room 9,” she said, popping her gum. “Like hell,” the biker grumbled, already leading her toward the stairs. I sighed, grabbed the key for Room 9, and tossed it over.

“Enjoy your stay.”

It wasn’t until later that Tina came back. She barged into the lobby, her mascara smudged, looking pale as hell. I frowned. “What now?”

She jabbed a thumb toward the courtyard.

I stared at her. “Are you high?”

She rolled her eyes. “Not the point.”

The biker stumbled in behind her, looking less convinced but still unsettled.

“I saw it too, man.” He rubbed his arms. “Some dude in a trucker cap, standing in the courtyard. Just… watching.”

“Did he say anything?”

Tina shook her head.

The biker lit a cigarette with shaky hands. “I looked away for a second. When I looked back, he was gone.”

Tina folded her arms. “That was a ghost.”

“Coulda been a guest,” I said, even though I knew it wasn’t.

Tina gave me a deadpan stare. “Bro, **the dude had no face**.""

I exhaled... Just another night at the Rusty Key Inn.

Once they left, I sat at the front desk, staring at the radio.

I knew I shouldn’t. I knew Clyde told me to leave it alone. But I couldn’t let it go. The signals were talking to me. And when Clyde tells you not to do something?

**That’s how you know it’s worth doing.**

I grabbed my flashlight and headed down into the basement. The air was thick, musty, like an old library and burnt wires. The stuffed parrot sat on its perch, its glass eyes staring at me. I don’t know what possessed me to do it, but I reached out and touched its beak. The thing jerked forward slightly, like something inside it clicked into place. And then, just like before—the hidden door slid open. Inside, the radio station sat untouched, like it had been waiting for me.

Dusty. Ancient.... But still running.

I took a deep breath and stepped up to the microphone.

I didn’t know why. I just did. I tapped it. “Uh. Hello?”

Silence. Then - a click.

And a new recording began to play.

**“February 2nd, 1975.”**

I frowned.

***“Weather’s been strange lately. The static’s been worse. And the mines? Well, you know what’s down there.”***

My stomach tightened. The voice wasn’t Clyde. But the background music?

**It was one of Clyde’s old blues songs**. The recording continued.

***“Some of you are already hearing the signals. Some of you have seen the Lantern Man.”***

I swallowed hard. The static warped. And then the voice changed.

Deeper. Wrong.

***""Elan""***

My breath caught. The speakers hissed.

***“You shouldn’t be here.""***

The lights flickered. And then the room got cold.

I turned. And I wasn’t alone.

At the entrance of the secret room, a figure stood, tall and flickering like bad reception.

Its outline glitched in and out of focus, like it wasn’t fully in this reality. Its face was a blur of static.

And the sound wasn’t coming from the speakers anymore. It was inside my head. My vision blurred, like my brain was tuning in and out of a bad frequency. And my memory of the moment? Already felt fake.

Almost like it had never really happened.

I ran.

I don’t remember running.

I don’t remember getting back upstairs.

But suddenly, I was behind the front desk again, panting like I’d just run a marathon.

The radio was off.

The motel was quiet.

I just finished my shift, and I'm about to go home and attempt to get some sleep. *Which I doubt will be possible*, **so wish me luck.**

**Has anyone experienced anything like this before? If you know something about “the signals” or pirate radio stations, let me know. I swear this isn’t a joke...**

**I'll post again soon if I have any updates...or Warcloud...or the signals don't kill me first!**

1i5ho81,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1i5ho81/recapping_my_first_royal_caribbean_cruise_on_icon/,Recapping my first Royal Caribbean cruise on Icon of the Seas,"Did the 7-night Western Caribbean from Miami in a balcony stateroom (11388), disembarked last week. Our first time sailing with Royal Caribbean; not super big cruisers but the trips we've taken have been on Norwegian mostly. Sharing some of my thoughts; TLDR terrific experience and very impressed with Royal Caribbean across the board (will definitely cruise with them again), huge ship but very well managed and very well thought out. Sorry for all the text, waiting for a flight so had some time to type --

* Getting on and off the ship, from checking in, ports, and disembarking, is the smoothest experience I have ever gone through in my lifetime, for any sort of trip. We did the check-in stuff on the app beforehand, got to PortMiami, dropped off our suitcases with one of the guys, literally went in, up the escalator, through security, and onto the ship in a few minutes (I was actually in disbelief that I was walking onto the ship, kept thinking I was walking to another part of the check-in process). I cannot gush enough how extremely fast we got on the ship, explored it, and were eating in Windjammer. We didn't pay for any extras like VIP or anything (I kind of wonder how fast things would be if we did). My wife and I were joking the trip was worth it just for the smooth check in process. With all the people, at ports, no waiting to get off the ship, smooth and orderly down the escalator and off the ship; same for getting back on (I don't even understand how they made it feel like it was a smaller ship's worth of people getting on and off board). In comparison,  NCL (from New York at least) involves a lot of waiting to first get on the ship, and at ports there is a lot of standing in line waiting. I remember our last NCL cruise to get off at one port we had to wait in a theatre with other groups of people, then had to wait, standing, in a line in the casino, then more waiting before disembarking. 
* Using the ship wifi was very easy. We paid for the Voom package, one user two devices and we didn't have any trouble the entire trip on our phones (email, social media, YouTube, etc.). We actually connected as soon as we got on the ship and were still exploring, before we got to the muster check-in. I was also able to use ExpressVPN on my phone and laptop with the ship wifi if I connected it after connecting through the app (needed to disconnect vpn to use all the features on the ship app again). My wife's corporate vpn did not work on Voom. Wifi on ExpressVPN was fast enough for me to upload large files, email, edit docs; I didn't test Zoom.
* The muster/safety check-in was very easy, showed up at the bar before the ice skating rink and a worker scanned our phones and that was it. I thought it was going to be waiting with groups of people like on NCL.
* When first exploring the ship we were overwhelmed by how large it is, literally like a mall on a cruise ship. Very quickly however somehow it stopped feeling like a huge ship and felt like a walkable ship like every other ship we've been on. Kudos to the very well thought-out design -- super super cool to be in a floating mall with shops but still feel very walkable -- In fact we chose to walk most of the time rather than wait for the elevators (which were very fast as well since they are the kind that go to the floor you choose first rather than stopping at every floor). Places were a good mix of feeling very busy without feeling super super packed.
* I used to live in New York and walked through Central Park almost every day, so before the trip I was kind of rolling my eyes at the idea of Icon's ""Central Park"". I confess I loved Royal Caribbean's Central Park concept -- breezy, comfortable, lots of places to sit and relax, and the cafe was nice to get snacks and drinks. I spent a bunch of time there in the chairs. I was very tempted to stop by the watch store in that area but did not give in.
* Food in the main dining room, buffet (Windjammer), and specialty (we tried the steakhouse and Izumi) was average, on par with Norwegian, in our opinion. We were not blown away, including by the pizza parlor place that people seem to rave about online -- very average. interestingly nothing tasted ""bad"", but rather a lot of flavorlessness. I do want to note I did not get food poisoning the entire trip, whereas on NCL I typically get food poisoning the first or second day. First day Windjammer had lobster, last evening Windjammer had lobster and a chocolate fountain/chocolate dipping station. One thing we liked was the cafe-like places (Pearl Cafe and the cafe in the Central Park area) -- the to-go boxes are an awesome idea and things like couscous salad and sandwiches  from there were great. We didn't pay for a drink package, found the lemonade, fruit punch, water, iced tea, juice coffee etc more than enough. Paid for a few alcoholic drinks and sodas during the trip, drinks were fairly light on the alcohol content. The food court area with crepes, asian stir fry, Mac and cheese, mediterranean was also cool, but again only average tasting (crepes were fine, overly sweet; asian stir fry worse than Panda Express). Overall we really enjoyed the variety of dining options in addition to a buffet. I don't think we were able to figure out the Main Dining Room reservation system, we reserved one floor (3) I think and kept going to the wrong floor (4 or 5) but getting seated anyway. The food being mostly the same in the main dining room and buffet made it so next trip we'd be fine without going to the dining room. Some people took the dress formal and dress in white nights fairly seriously, others dressed however. 
* The aqua diving show with the robots, Starburst ice skating show, Wizard of Oz, and the new superhero show -- these were amazing. Terrific to begin with and the fact they're on a ship brings it to amazing. We could only get tickets once I think so I went back on my own for standing room only to watch the aqua show and ice skating show by myself twice. The superhero show didn't require reservations. I liked the Q&A with performers and the Chief Dog Officer, found it informative and fun. I even enjoyed the pirate show thing in the main lobby. I didn't participate but liked watching others enjoy the silent parties with the headsets, too.
* Employees were all extremely professional and hard working, more so than on NCL and Carnival, in my opinion. My wife actually thought the employees seemed unhappy/""too"" serious but I don't think I felt that. There seemed to be a large number of middle manager types walking around and asking the other staff to do things like clean or pickup, which I thought was interesting. Stateroom attendants I saw at 6am, 9pm, not sure what kind of schedules they have but very intense. 
* The room is much nicer (partly because newer, partly because the layout feels better thought out maybe) than on NCL balcony rooms, love the lighting control panel and different modes (like movie/theater mode). Water temperature very good, pressure fine, very good size balcony with outdoor light, good privacy as well. When walking to our room the first day to pickup our room keys we actually walked by our luggage in the hallway, not sure when they would have been delivered on their own, so we just rolled them the rest of the way. The bed/s were nothing special.
* Ports/excursions: Did the Gumbalimba park tour in Roatan, nothing in Costa Maya (just walked around), nothing in CocoCay (walked around and lounged on the beach); we had booked a submarine excursion in Cozumel but it got canceled around 45 minutes before check-in time due to the weather (refunded). We enjoyed the different stops and being able to relax and go at our own pace.
* Miscellaneous: we couldn't really figure out the disembarkation process beforehand (reserved one time on the app but then it got changed on its own for some reason); we were fine with handling our own luggage so we just left the room at 8am after breakfast; they put out a ton of chairs on the top decks, I mean a weirdly huge amount; I understand the idea I guess but the entire trip there were just huge swaths of empty chairs by the pool and upper decks; mini golf, basketball, the water slides are all very cool, also liked watching the dodgeball competition; the Royal Caribbean app is great, including the customer service messaging and for reserving things; very good sized gym with lots of equipment, wish there were more freestanding benches however (only a handful that were always occupied whether I went at 6am or at 9pm), liked the other gym area / yoga type area but the stationary bikes on that level didn't seem to work; liked the running track; liked the water bottle refill stations; casino was smaller than I would have expected but decent, casino nonsmoking area was pretty good. When in port and first walking off, if there was another ship next to us the Icon would seem similar in size, but once we got to the end and could see both ships side by side, we were always blown away by how wide the Icon is, very impressive in scale. Nothing to do with the ship but I wish more people wore masks and washed their hands; lots of coughing openly without covering and lots of walking right by handwash stations; I was fine for most of the trip, got deathly sick on the last night despite being covid and flu vaccinated.

We've written often about the amazing Kozaks and their beautiful songs[,](https://imgur.com/a/YOZhK75) their impressive military feats, their enigmatic leaders, their fun gadgets, and even an architectural style that they invented. Today we will talk about one of their secret weapons - a soup that makes them undefeatable - Kapusnyak!

Kapusnyak is delightfully but sophisticatedly sour, and can easily be made vegetarian by using your favorite mushrooms - though in the winter it's extra nice to make it super meaty using pork, chicken, or your choice! Today we will bring you an old school recipe that is spiced with the Kozak's freedom-loving spirit... and a bit of millet and salo.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Zaporizhzhian Kapusnyak

This is a quite old school recipe - millet is very traditional in Kozak cuisine! The potatoes, of course, are not. If you skip the millet, you have the base of a modern Kapusnyak - and you can totally experiment with other kinds of meat.

Ingredients

* Pork (pork ribs work well): 900g
* Salo (pork belly works): 100g
* Potatoes: 500g
* Onion: 3 pc. small to medium
* Carrot: 2 pc. medium (around 200g)
* Parsley root: 100g
* Celery: 100g
* Sauerkraut: 500g (store-bought is completely acceptable)
* Millet: 40g
* Garlic: 1 clove.
* Parsley greens: one bunch (20g)
* Bay leaf: 1 pc.
* Salt: 1 tsp.
* For serving: sour cream, parsley greens.

Recipe

1. Put the pork in a deep pot, cover it with water and bring it to a boil over high heat. Skim off the foam, reduce the heat and add one whole carrot and onion. Cook everything for about an hour covered by the lid. Remove the cooked meat from the broth.
2. Peel and cut the remaining carrot, onion (set aside a little for step 3), celery, and parsley root into strips, and then sauté in a pan in butter or oil until cooked.
3. Rinse the sauerkraut, wring it out and cook it over low heat in a fresh pan, adding a little broth from time to time.
4. While the sauerkraut is cooking, we can prepare the star ingredient: in a mortar or using a blender, grind the salo with a clove of garlic, finely chopped onion, and parsley greens.
5. Cut the potatoes into medium-sized cubes and put them in the broth. When they are becoming soft, but not fully cooked yet, add stewed sauerkraut and millet to it, followed by sautéed vegetables.
6. When everything seems fully cooked, add the pork, ground salo, bay leaf, and salt. Then turn off the heat and leave the pot under the closed lid for 20-30 minutes to infuse.

Before serving, some people like to mash the veggies a little more. It is usually served with a dollop of sour cream on top, sprinkled with parsley, and don't forget warm bread on the side - preferably rye. Like many soups, this one especially is often tastier the next day.

* 2 buds of cloves
* 2.5 liters of water
* 350 g of sauerkraut
* 100 g of buckwheat
* Salt and pepper
* Sour cream for serving (optional)

**Recipe**

1. First you need to make cracklings. Remove the skin from 2-3 chicken thighs.
2. Cut the chicken skin into small pieces and fry in a dry pan until golden brown. Leave them until the soup is served.
3. Make chicken stock: Add the chicken thighs, one carrot (roughly chopped), and a whole onion, making crisscross cuts.
4. Add spices: 2 bay leaves, 2-3 allspice peas and 2 clove buds. Boil the broth for 20 minutes. If necessary, remove the foam that has formed, and then strain it.
5. Add 100g of buckwheat and 350g of sauerkraut to the broth. Cook until the buckwheat is ready and the sauerkraut is soft - usually around 10-15 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.

**July 17th, 1913**

**Outside Zanesville, Indiana, Military District No.2**

Sweat dripped from the tanned face of Captain Terry de la Mesa Allen as he led his twenty-man detachment down a dusty Indiana backroad. The khaki-clad soldiers from 3rd Rifle Company, 23rd Infantry Regiment marched in a loose column formation with half of their number on each side of the dirt path and were trailed by four additional men guiding a pack mule with enough provisions to last the troop at least a week. Hanging off each side of the mule were two blankets wrapped around cylindrical shapes that bounced around with each step forward. Two of the men guiding the mule, the only two besides Allen in the detachment without a rifle, eyed the blankets zealously to ensure they did not fall off their clasps as they neared their objective. Captain Allen and his men had been marching from regimental headquarters in Fort Wayne for the past four hours now, and the mid-July heatwave as well as a cloudless sky served to make the march a miserable experience. Behind Allen, his three Sergeants, all battle-hardened veterans from the Revolution as he was, barked sharp orders to keep the volunteers on pace and alert. The flat farmlands of northern Indiana they marched through were pockmarked full of craters, signs of the pacification campaign from two years ago, and gave Allen the sense that he was walking through a barren wasteland, devoid of all life. To the back of the column lay the small community of Zanesville where the signs of revolution were still obvious even after so much time had passed. While there were some signs of reconstruction, many of the buildings still lay in ruins and a small horde of beggar children swarmed the column asking for handouts. Allen tried not to think of how many were likely orphans, and if he had been the one to make them that way. 

“Company, halt!” Allen shouted. “We’ll hold here for a moment and get some water. Heads on a swivel boys! There could still be Revie snipers out in those craters waiting to take a potshot.” His men proceeded to break ranks and fan themselves with their campaign hats. Allen knew most of the men's canteens were already empty, his sure was, but he needed them to catch their breaths and get a closer look. Allen stooped to catch his breath, unbutton the top button of his uniform, and loosen his tie. Reaching into the pocket of his sweat-soaked blouse, Allen fished out the pair of small brass binoculars that had seen him through the entire war. He smiled to himself before raising it to his eyes, it had been his father's in the Civil War and was gifted to him on his acceptance into West Point, and scanned the horizon. A few miles down the road lay his target. Through the eyepieces, he was able to make out the front faces of a few shoddy sheet metal buildings and one better-built wooden one. They were surrounded by a wall of fencing topped with barbed wire and four wooden watch towers stood at each corner. There was a gate centered on the path the column was marching and behind that stood a tall flag pole which flew a flag with a dark blue background, diagonal crossed red stripes, and a large white star in the middle—the flag of the Hancockian Corps. 

“Vhat’s ze plan, sir?” asked the German-born Sergeant Kurtz who joined Allen at the front of the column. Allen motioned his other two Sergeants over before responding. 

“Well, we have our orders from General Funston. Avoid casualties if at all possible, disarm that facility, and under no circumstances shoot first. They didn’t give us enough men for any flanking maneuvers and technically the bastards are supposed to comply with Federal troops… Here’s what we’ll do. Our two best shots are Truman and Cachan, right? Let’s have them break off now and position themselves in craters on both sides of the camp. If bullets start flying they can give some covering fire before slinking off and hopefully reporting to regiment that we’re all buzzard food.”

“Fighting Fred didn’t vant to make it easy, eh, sir?”

“The demands placed on the District since last week have stretched our numbers a bit thin, yes.”

“So zat means up ze middle, ja?”

“Precisely Sergeant Kurtz. We move to the front gate and tell them how it is. And if they fail to heed our request… well the mule will at least take a few more of the bastards down.” Allen faced his Sergeants and nodded. “Let’s make it happen.” As the Sergeants barked orders, he tightened his tie and buttoned his blouse, professionalism had to be maintained. He also pulled his Colt Service Revolver out of its holster and checked it for dust. He hoped he would be able to pull it in time if need be. 

With his two skirmishers deploying to the flanks of the camp, Allen marched his men the rest of the way, the buildings becoming larger and the towers taller as they approached. Mentally, he noted there was one Hancockian in each tower. Importantly, it did not appear that the men had machine guns, only rifles. Two guards were standing outside of the camp gate and watched silently as the column of men approached. The Hancockians wore uniforms almost completely identical to those of the Federal Army, but while Allen's uniform was a dark khaki, the Hancockians were tanned to look almost mustard brown. Most strikingly, they also wore armbands on their left arms which were a smaller version of the Hancockian flag to distinguish themselves from legitimate Federal authorities. 

As Allen closed the distance to the gate to twenty feet, one of the paramilitary troopers stepped forward and unslung his rifle off of his shoulder. “That’s about far enough Freds,” he spoke harshly. The Corporal—the Corps used the same rank structure as the Army— looked Allen up and down as his columns broke formation and fanned out around the gate with unslung rifles. The two soldiers without rifles remained in the back with the mule and stood firm at its sides. “State your business, Captain.”

“Good afternoon. I am Captain Allen of the United States Army with a message for Major Fielding, the last known commander of this detention camp. If you would please bring him-”

“I can take your message,” the Corporal interrupted.

“No. I am to speak with Major Fielding directly trooper. Please bring him out here now.” The Corporal looked Allen dead in the eyes. “*If the shooting starts here*,” Allen thought to himself, “*this one is as good as dead. Come on man, have some common sense!*” he could feel the stares of the watchtower guards as well. The only comforting notion he could hold on to was the hope that Truman and Cachan had gotten into position and sighted their rifles at them correctly. Allen moved his hand to rest on the hilt of his revolver. Eyes flicking to the motion and back, the Corporal nodded. 

Looking back at the other Hancockian guard he said, “Better bring the Major up here.” The guard moved to a small fenced hole in the gate and spoke to someone on the other side. The men waited in silence for a few minutes. To Allen, they felt like hours before finally there was a commotion behind the wall as the gate blocks were removed and the doors swung open. As the doors opened they revealed a sizeable contingent of Hancockian soldiers standing with weapons drawn. From the crowd emerged a man with a Major’s oak leaf rank and an officer's visor cap.

Allen took stock of the Hancockians quickly. There was a mishmash of rifles and shotguns among them, but importantly “*No machine guns*,” Allen thought to himself.

“Good afternoon Major Fielding, I am Captain Allen of the United States Ar-”

“You’re looking at a higher rank Captain! When you greet an officer of a higher rank you salute, do you not? I ought to write you up for insubordination,” Fielding interrupted. Allen grimaced, some Hancockian officers thought that their rank was equivalent with those of the military, and usually, they were the hardest to deal with. Allen considered it insubordination of the highest degree.

Ignoring that statement, Allen reached into his pocket and unfolded a piece of paper marked with the Great Seal of the United States. “Major Fielding: in accordance with Executive Order 1767, signed into law by President James Garfield of the United States on July 10th, 1913, you are to immediately cease all activity that furthers the agenda of the Hancockian Corps. Seeing that the Corps has violated the laws of ethical conflict, acting as the equivalent of Federal authority in the Military Occupation Districts, and knowingly undergone military actions without the express permission of the Executive Branch of the United States, the Hancockian Corps is hereby outlawed.” He let the words hang in the air for a moment before continuing. “You have had a week to comply and seeing that you have not made any effort to reach your designated rally point for disarmament I have been empowered by Brigadier General Funston, commander of Military Occupation District No.2, to occupy this site and ensure you stand down. Radio messages have been announcing this for the past week, Major.”

“Humph. Come to think of it, Captain, I believe I heard a message of the sort on the westinghouse. But see, how could I in good conscience order my men to leave? This here is a vital prison facility and we have over fifty Revie prisoners under close supervision. If we left, they might have gotten free and polluted this area with their radical bile.” The Major was standing firm. 

“Were all of your prisoners confirmed by the Bureau of Public Safety then? As you well know that’s been the standard procedure since March to avoid… overzealousness, like that other detention camp outside Chicago. You know the one, the BPS conducted an undercover operation to get all the juicy details. Even arrested Deputy National Commander Jacob H. Smith for his involvement. They were abducting people off the streets, torturing them, and executing them without trial. It was quite the scandal.”

Major Fielding was unperturbed. “It’s cowardice to shy away from what has to be done to cleanse this land which is leading us back down the path of revolution. The men of the Hancockian Corps do what is necessary Captain Allen.”

“The methods were cruel and punitive. For every innocent you lot gunned down how many loyal Americans did you turn into traitors? I have delivered you orders from the highest authority. I am requesting you comply.”

“Impossible. We are in the process of extracting information that is vital to the pacification of Indiana. To comply would be a dereliction of duty,” Major Fielding spoke dryly. “I take my duties very seriously. Do you Captain?”

The challenge to see how far Allen was willing to take things was obvious. With the hand not resting on his revolver, he made a quick motion to the men behind him. With a speed and preciseness that indicated they had practiced the movement many times, the soldiers standing next to the mule unclasped the blankets and caught the machine guns that tumbled out. In one movement, they crouched into firing positions and cocked the guns. “I take my duties seriously as well Major Fielding,” Allen said. 

While many of the Hancockians behind the Major appeared shaken or took a step back, Fielding seemed undisturbed. “A couple of machine guns are nothing to sneeze at sure Captain, but see here. You’d still be the first to die, and I would place a hefty wager that you were told not to fire the first shot,” he pointed to the machine guns, “Those are a bluff. And these are dangerous times and a dangerous place, it would not be unreasonable to assume your company was massacred by Revie terrorists before ever reaching my camp. Hell, that might even encourage the wet-lips in government to keep us around.” As much as he hated to admit it, Fielding was spot on. Allen was not above bending the rules if it meant a greater chance of survival for him and his men, but the Hancockians had cover and a hardened position to hide behind. In an instant he decided, the greatest chance of success would be in doubling down. 

“You might get away with framing it that way, although I doubt you’d be around to see it as I intend to blow your brains out first, but the platoons I have surrounding this damned place would storm your walls and kill or capture the rest of your number in minutes. And then report the story accurately. That you acted first either bringing shame on the Hancockian Corps as your legacy is blacklisted to keep any semblance of respectability for your organization, or you are celebrated by the fire-eating few adding yet another black mark to justify your outlawing. Is that what you want your legacy to be?”

“Don’t make me laugh! There ain’t a single phantom fed out in those craters yonder.” Fielding grinned widely, sure of himself and his conclusion. 

“*Dear lord, please let this work*,” Allen thought to himself before shouting, “Platoon C! Reveal one of your numbers!” Suddenly, a loud crack pierced the air causing everyone but Allen and Fielding to look around wildly. The rifle shot had come from the left and Allen quickly glanced over to see Private Cachan standing halfway out of a crater. Looking back at Fielding, Allen noticed doubt in his eyes for the first time. 

“Another bluff! If you had that many men you would have made your presence clear! That is a single man standing in a crater Captain Allen! And he just revealed his position! You!” He shouted pointing to the nearest watchtower guard. “Can you see into that crater!?”

“No sir!” the guard shouted back. “He’s too far over the horizon, I can’t tell if there are more!”

Allen thought quickly again and before Fielding could make any rational decisions he forcefully uttered “Am I bluffing Major?” He paused. “Maybe I just want to provoke you and fill your body with enough lead that the people of Zanesville can pull it out, melt it down, and use it to put up a statue of me. In memoriam, yes, for putting down the dog who butchered their families, but to see you Hancockian bastards die would make it worth it. My men are all volunteers, no draftees here. They know what they signed up for. Are you really better at anything other than terrorizing civilians at this point? 

Fielding began to stammer a response, but it was Allen’s turn to interrupt now. “Last chance Major. Lower your flag, turn in your weapons, and vacate the area. I will allow you to keep your sidearm and two rifles for your journey straight to your designated rally point.”

Major Fielding stared daggers into Allen's eyes. Finally, he turned away from Allen with a sneer that acknowledged his defeat. “Corporal, lower the flag *slowly* and Lieutenant get me on the horn with Commander Douglas. Something tells me this is going all the way to the top.”

**Act 2**

**October 15th, 1913**

**Supreme Court Chamber, Hancock DC**

Chief Justice Frederick William Lehmann sat back in his comfortable office chair as the grandfather clock in the hallway chimed twelve times, signaling noon. Removing his reading glasses and putting down the court brief he had been reading, Frederick scooted back and used the arms of the chair to lift his sizeable bulk from behind his desk. He walked eagerly over to his coat stand and put on his overcoat and tophat. “Mary,” he said to his secretary as he closed his office door behind him, “I’m taking my daily sabbatical now. I’ll be back before the clock strikes one, your usual again today?”

“I’ve said it before sir, but you really do not need to get me anything!” Lehmann cocked his eyebrow at her in amusement. “That would be wonderful sir,” she said with a sigh, “you haven’t forgotten your coin purse again have you?”

Frederick reached into his coat pocket and jingled the purse, “I’ve left it in the coat now!” he called back to her as he stepped into the main hallway that connected the Justice's offices with the outside world and the Old Senate Chamber where they presided. “One would think me as forgetful as Ahab was fierce,” he chuckled to himself as he walked towards the doorway on the eastern side of the Capitol Building. Walking briskly, he nearly bowled over another man as he exited his office annex. “Goodness, Rutherford my apologies! Are you alright man?”

Associate Justice Rutherford Platt Hayes regained his footing and smiled at the older and heavier man. “Quite alright mister Chief Justice, thank you. My glasses didn’t fall off which is all that really matters.” Frederick smiled back. While he did his best to maintain good relations with all the Justices on the Stand, he held a special affection for Rutherford Hayes. The press would usually liken the two together as the most progressive members of the Court for their similar views in favor of corporate income taxes and the forced separation of investment banks, commercial banks, and brokerages. They were also of like mind when it came to the Hancockian question when that particular case inevitably made its way to stand before the Court. But most importantly to Frederick, the two men were bibliophiles who delighted in collecting rare and first-edition books. When they were out of term, they would often spend time together going over their collections and swapping their most interesting finds. 

“Yes, that would be rather debilitating if those broke. You have your homburg and coat Rutherford, where are you off to? I never see you out of your office at midday.”

“I wanted to take a stroll around the Mall before the Winter chills set in too heavily. If it’s as horrid as last year it’s entirely possible I won’t see natural sunlight until March when it becomes reasonable again and I don’t feel the need to be bundled up by the fire all day.”

“Ah I see, why don’t you join me instead? I have my daily appointment on the corner of 2nd and C Street. It’s a nice walk and I can tell you of a lead I have on a first-edition Dickens.” Frederick watched Rutherford nod.

“This is the same appointment that sometimes leads to danishes, correct? If so then I shall accompany you.” Frederick nodded back and the two men exited the Capitol and started through the grassy park towards 2nd and C, speaking of authors and current events the whole way.

Hancock was a changed city since the darkest days of the Revolution a couple of years before. Where fear and paranoia had gripped the city now was filled with life on the sunny but chilly October afternoon. Automobiles tooted down the freshly paved streets, surrounded on both sides by the mishmash of neoclassical and brownstone architecture that defined the monuments and townhomes. The aeroplanes that droned on overhead were no longer pursuit planes in formation on a combat air patrol, but speedy airmail or or duel propeller passenger liners brought on by the technological innovations in the war, connecting the country like never before. Where defensive sandbags were once laid and passes were checked by soldiers on every other street's checkpoint, flowerbeds and trees had been planted. Newly unveiled monuments dedicated to the veterans who put down the Revolution now stood in the center of some of the major intersections and a spirit of hope seemed to resound from their stone, resolute faces. Making their way onto 1st Street, the two Justices passed a food cart, seemingly every few steps, each one beckoning them with the smell of freshly cooked meat and shouting with different accents. 

Rutherford appeared surprised. “I must not walk the streets enough during the day, I had not realized how much Hancock had been washed away by the flavor wave. Have you ever eaten from any of these booths, Frederick?”

“A few, yes, when I’m especially hungry. I recommend the borscht but try to find a Ukrainian seller. I’ve found they tend to put cream cheese in theirs,” he replied as they turned right onto C Street. Finally, they ambled down the last crosswalk and reached their destination. *La rue de Paris* was a quaint French-themed cafe that had opened in the very first wave of flavor wave immigration. It was Parisian-themed of course, with a glass front face and inviting flowerbeds hanging from them. In the Spring or Summer Frederick would sit at a table outside to drink his tea or coffee and read a book or the paper but they had been taken inside to prepare for the coming Winter. “Here we are then Rutherford! I come here every weekday at noon to enjoy some time out of the Chambers.”

“That’s quite the routine, Frederick, you must really enjoy this place.”

“Indeed. Sometimes it is my favorite part of the day.” They entered the cafe and were greeted by the aroma of freshly ground coffee beans and baked pastries. A large, ornate westinghouse stood in the corner playing a light ragtime tune. They sat down at a table by the window which was decorated with a small bouquet of flowers in a plain vase. There were a couple of businessmen and young couples sitting throughout the rest of the cafe, filling it with a pleasant chatter. Odette, the wife of the owner named Jean, and the cafe's waitress maneuvered over to the Justices.

“Bienvenue back, Chief Justice Lehmann, what can I get for you zis time?” she spoke in a heavy French accent. 

“Good afternoon to you Odette, I’m feeling a bit more peckish today so I’ll take your *Café gourmand* but with a substitution of the espresso for a cappuccino if you can manage it. And also a raspberry danish if there are any left. Mary loves them,” Frederick requested. She looked to Rutherford who ordered a black tea.

“Mais oui gentlemen, I’ll also tell Jean in ze back zat you are here. He will probably like to say ‘ello,” as she backed out to return to the counter, another man walked through the door and looked around. He wore a dark suit and homburg and looked exactly identical to the other thousands of civil servants in Hancock. He also held a large black briefcase in his hand. The man's eyes came to rest on the table where the Justices sat and while he seemed unperturbed by the presence of Frederick, he seemed to get a look of shock when he recognized Rutherford. He moved to sit down at the table nearest to them and nodded to them as he set down the briefcase. Frederick overheard him order a black coffee from Odette.

Returning the nod and then ignoring the man who was obviously either a surprised civil servant or a pensioner building up the courage to speak to Frederick, he turned back to Rutherford and said “I must have tried everything on the menu at this point, I’ve come here so often. I was their first real regular and Odette and Jean have treated me well. They’ve come to benefit from it too, there was a reporter from the *Journal-American* who tailed me here one day and tried to conduct an interview. Of course, I shut him down but that didn’t stop them from publishing my little routine here! For weeks after that, grovelers and well-wishers were plugging up the store, so I instituted a little rule. If you want to talk to me, you have to buy something from the cafe first!”

Rutherford laughed. “Thankfully the craze surrounding you appears to have settled down now. But speaking of the *Journal*, did you see that drivel they wrote about George Van Horn Moseley last week? It was a biographical piece that one would believe to be *auto*\-biographical from how much high praise they steeped on him. Enlisted to fight in the Continental Alliance War and then on to West Point, which is of course rife with “undesirables” as they put it, before taking part in every Hancockian intervention from Honduras to Mexico with amazing feats of bravery at every step of the way. What they don’t explain is where, in all that time fighting, he was able to attain the judicial acumen to become the head legal representative of the entire Hancockian Corps in their bid to maintain their existence.”

“I hadn’t read that particular piece but I’ll believe your interpretation. It was inevitable that Executive Order 1767 was going to be challenged, but frankly,” Frederick lowered his voice and leaned closer to Rutherford, “I think Garfield expected the challenge more on the open field of combat and not through the courts.” He leaned back while Rutherford nodded in agreement.

“How long until Moseley v. United States comes before us do you think?”

“Soon I’d posture. Maybe even before the year is up. With how much national interest there is surrounding the case I think the only way it can meet a satisfactory ending is by being judged by the highest court in the land. It spent little time in the lower courts and now is before the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, but I doubt they hold on to it longer than a month before deferring and sending it up to us. At which point we will, of course, be obligated to grant the petition, it might be one of the most important cases we judge on in our entire tenure as Justices. But please, enough of work talk, I see our orders coming and you need to match my Dickens lead with one of your own.”

As Odette walked up with her tray she stopped to place the black coffee on the table of the man next to them, however instead of paying he pulled out his pocket watch and abruptly stood up, nearly knocking the rest of the tray over. Mumbling an apology he quickly made for the door and walked away at high speed. Out of the corner of his eye, Frederick noticed the man looked oddly sweaty for an October day. 

“Well that was certainly rude,” Rutherford commented as Odette placed the Justice's orders on their table.

“Perhaps he realized he was late for a meeting he had forgotten. It’s happened to me, Odette why don’t you let me pay for his coffee?”

“If he’s late for a meeting he’ll certainly be back. Look, Frederick, he forgot his briefca-” 

The explosion cut off Rutherford before he could finish pointing out where, unbeknownst to him in his last few moments of life, the bomb was hidden. The blast shattered the windows sending debris and bits of flesh onto the street causing further injury as the shrapnel from glass shards butchered passerbys. With the close placement and enough explosives in the briefcase to level a house, Frederick William Lehmann and Rutherford Platt Hayes were both instantly killed as well as every other patron of the cafe besides the owner and busboy still in the kitchen. Horrified civilians froze in fear as the trauma of the Revolution returned in an instant to grip the city. However, many did not remain frozen long as their minds, callused from struggle and hardship, broke free from their mental blocks to rush forward toward the chaos to see if they could save the lives of any of their fellow Americans. 

**Act 3**

**November 2nd, 1913**

**Yellow Oval Room, The White House**

The fireplace crackled and the gas lamps burned dimmer and dimmer inside the President’s private study as the two men stood huddled over a desk covered with papers. They had inched their table closer to the fire and were swaddled in blankets to fight the cold that had descended on Hancock in the first snowstorm to hit the city since February. Around the oval room were large bookshelves filled with old records of government, legal tomes, encyclopedias, and everything else President James Rudolph Garfield felt was necessary to aid in his running of the country. However, their focus lay solely on the notes, testimonials, and thinly veiled letters from backers probably hoping for a patronage job later down the line. Those, and the question nagging at the mind of every other American at that very moment.

“Please Mister President, tell me how you of all people can be that hesitant to agree with me? The Hancockian Corps had the most to gain from the deaths of Chief Justice Lehmann and Justice Hayes, the briefcase bomb used sophisticated wiring and military-grade explosives, and they have proven time and again they are willing to break the law to see their ends met!” said William Loeb Jr. The President’s friend, close confidant, and private secretary had taken off his glasses to rub his eyes as he spoke, the dim light and hours of reading and rereading taking its toll. 

“I do not deny all of the facts that point towards this being the fault of ‘Supreme Commander’ Enoch Crowder and his ilk, but William you too should understand that it is just as likely that terrorist attack was carried out by Revie holdouts!” President Garfield responded. This particular round of the same argument had taken up the last half hour at this point and both men were tired and frustrated. “Sophisticated wiring can be found in the toolbox of every competent electrician from here to Baja, and I don’t think only the military has access to high-grade explosives these days. With so much unexploded ordnance still leftover in cities and fields it is just as easy to imagine a diehard group taking some dud artillery rounds and removing the explosives for a bomb. I don’t need to address the point that they are willing to break the law.”

“Why then do you think they would want to go and blow up Lehmann and Hayes of all people on the Court? They knew it was only a matter of time before Moseley reached the Supreme Court and the Hancockians would have known both of them would have sided for abolishment. If it were the Revies they would have tried to bomb someone like Justice Shiras instead. Lehmann supported the Second Bill of Rights for pete’s sake.”

“I fail to believe that radicals, still holding out by this point, are willing to notice the difference between a nominally conservative or progressive member of government. If they are still operating, which they are as you deliver me my reports detailing the happenings of the Military Districts every day, then they would strike for as high a target as they can no matter who they are. No, Lehmann was a good Justice who sided with the people, but he was also the only Justice with a widely published daily routine that he stuck to even after the fact. He was a skilled lawyer and so persuasive you didn’t dare decide against him. You feel as though you're ruling against God. That they got Hayes too in that bombing was simply the greatest stroke of bad luck to befall this government since President Meyer’s death. While the killer remains at large we can only guess.”

“I’ll rest easier when Director Burns and the Bureau of Investigation catch the scoundrel.”

“As will I, William. It was a good idea to assign Burns to lead the case personally. What better way to calm the nation than to tell them their greatest detective is on the hunt?” Garfield rubbed his temple and blinked the pain behind his eyes away. “What time is it William?”

“Ten minutes to midnight Mister President. Would you like another cup of coffee?”

“No thank you. We need to decide on the nominees now. Tonight. The Appeals Court can only use the excuse of a period of heightened security and mourning for so much longer before they have to reconvene and Moseley is sent up and if the Senate isn’t given enough time then some opportunist will muck it up so that the nominees aren’t voted on until the new term next year. Run through the list for me, one last time.”

William shuffled around the papers and picked up the four that had the notes on their last four candidates. “Alright then Mister President, for the final time your possible nominees for Chief or Associate Justice are:

**Jesse Root Grant II:**

Ah yes, the **“Iron Attorney General”**, as his moniker was during his tenure in the cabinet of President Thomas Custer. During this time he was extremely effective in persecuting the Communards and Revelationists during the Second Radicalization Era and even rode out with Custer on a few of his raids. He was the only one besides Secretary of State Francis Cockrell to stay for all three terms and is a **Custerite** through and through. As the **1904 Commonwealth presidential nominee** he just barely lost his spot in the second round to Rockefeller. In that election, he vowed to bring back elements of the custerite society that were axed by President Chaffee but our administration agrees with including public works and restoring the bureaucracy. He differed from Custer by tapping into **anti-monopolism** and has since come out more strongly in favor of business regulation. A graduate of **Columbia Law School**, during the Revolution he did lecture circuits at the universities on law during civil conflict. He is **supportive of the Second Bill of Rights** however prioritizes putting down radical elements just as he did as Attorney General. Additionally, he spoke out **against the excesses of the Hancockian Corps** during those circuits so would likely side against them in Moesley. Overall he is the clear **choice of the Administration** as he would meet wide acclamation from the general public since his career is now associated with a time of simpler stability and high favorability. He would likely have the easiest time passing through the Senate for either role and we have already received evidence of much through backroom endorsements from the old **Eastern Progressive** faction in both the Visionary and Homeland Alliances as well as Governor **Hiram Johnson**. The only hang-up is his **openness to foreign immigration and businesses, which could rankle the feathers of Vardaman’s clique**, although his overall popularity would surely not affect the Alliance too much.

**George S. Patton II:**

Patton is the **handpicked nominee from Vice President Vardaman** and I still have the note here Mister President. It just reads “George S. Patton” underlined twice and then the words **“Suffer no Traitors”**, signed Vice President James K. Vardaman. He ran a successful law firm in California defending farming businesses before becoming a landowner himself. He comes into better focus with the **War of the Continental Alliance in which he served on the Chilean Front** with the California National Guard as their Inspector General. Coming back he became more involved in state politics, serving one term in the House of Representatives as a member of the **Independence Party** where he had a **nominally conservative and nativist voting record** before deciding not to run for reelection to enter the staff of Harvey Firestone. He was an extremely skilled litigator at Firestone and would **likely often side with business**. During the Revolution, he was one of the authors of the **Firestone Proposal which argued for unconditional surrender or total annihilation** of the Revies and is strongly **against the Second Bill of Rights**. Overall, he is a clear choice of the **Bootspitter** faction of the Homeland Alliance and would meet the most difficult time going through the Senate. When it comes to Moesley, you can bet Patton **sides with the Hancockian Corps** and would argue against abolishing them. He would be the **biggest olive branch to Vardaman but would upset Borah’s faction** and is **endorsed by Representatives Lindbergh and Ford**. It would be a tough fight with the Visionaries in the Senate as well. 

**Augustus P. Gardner**

However, Mister President, if you wanted to go for a more **moderate military figure** then our man is Congressman Gardner. A graduate of **Harvard Law School**, he volunteered and fought through the **War of the Continental Alliance on the Argentinian** **front earning a Certificate of Merit**. He then became a **Patriotic Party Congressman** from Massachusetts where he had a **moderate and nativist voting record** that heavily supported President Chaffees military modernization agenda. When the Revolution broke out he left Congress to lead an infantry battalion and chewed barbed wire with them on the front line until President Fish had to order him to back since he was a vital vote in **support of the war legislature measures** although it is rumored he very nearly resigned from Congress to stay with his men. He’s the only real **wildcard on the Hancockian Corps** as he has never stated anything publicly to indicate he leans one way or another, and he has many connections across the Homeland Alliance across the factions. **He reluctantly supported the Second Bill of Rights but as a measure to end the war only and has since moderated against the clause for collective bargaining**. He would be met with a great amount of relief from the moderates and is an acceptable olive branch to Vardaman. The public loves a war hero too and he has received endorsements from **William Taft** and **Henry Cabot Lodge** who both put his name forward when they rejected our feelers to be nominated themselves. 

**Albert B. Cummins:**

Finally, we have the **former member of the Freedom Party**, Iowa Senator Cummins. He’s the pick of the **Western Progressive faction headed by Senator Borah** who rejected our offer to nominate him in favor of staying in the Senate. I know you were disappointed by that one Mister President, it would have been nice to file that troublemaker away. He had a meteoric rise from being born in a log house to passing the Illinois bar and finally setting up his own law practice in Iowa. He ended up as the Governor, where he was incredibly popular for creating **compulsory education and an agriculture department**, and then Senator in 1908. As a founding member of the Alliance, he was quite the f**irebrand during the war, pushing for victory, but still argued that the Federal government was taking too many steps that strengthened Federal power and violated the Constitution and individual liberty**. He tried to stop the Bureau of Public Safety’s informant programs in favor of smaller and local watch boards. **He is the most outspoken in favor of the Second Bill of Rights and the most outspoken against the Hancockian Corps of our potential nominees** who would surely be met with a sigh of relief by the Visionaries. While the progressives in Homeland would be overjoyed, the moderates would just tolerate this pick while the Bootspitters and Vardaman’s clique especially would see it as an insult as the feud between him and Borah is well-known.

“Those are the options, Mister President. Whichever combination you choose, you’ll inevitably lose the support of some faction or another. Not only do we have to keep the Alliance itself together, but your Administration too so choose wisely.”

‘Thank you, William. I believe it is in the best interest of the Alliance and the Union to move ahead with the nominations of…”

**Important Note: This election will have two winners with the most-vote getter being nominated for Chief Justice and the second-most Associate Justice**

Thanks.

I was sitting at a coffee shop, minding business and playing on my phone with my chair pointed out towards the ordering area. I noticed this beautiful woman sitting down at a table almost right across from me. So since she caught my attention I was thinking if she was Filipina or Latina. After a couple minutes I thought about a confident way of approaching her. My idea was to type in “Are you Filipina in Philippine.” So I did, The baristas went into the back and I sprung into action. I walked up and translated the best I could. She kinda laughed and said what? I played it off and asked her if she was Filipina because the shape of her “eyelid” (should’ve just said eyes) haha. 

We started to smile at each other and she said she was Mexican. I asked her what she does for a living and then she replied back. I work in emergency services and had some insignia on and she asked if me if that’s what I do and I replied nonchalantly with a yes. She asked me what I had going on for the rest of the day and I said I had to do some plumbing at my house. She said oh well that’s productive hahaha. Anyways we ended up air dropping each other’s number. She said she would text me but I got kinda excited and I was pushing in my chair while she was getting up from hers and casually asked her what hobbies she had. she said again that she would text me. It sounded kind of like an out sort of. But it’s been hard with dealing with the anticipation of the wait. I have her number but I really don’t want to come off as needy because i have been in the past. I really do want to plan a date with her. Truthfully I sounded somewhat choked up about asking her about a coffee date before we got up. She may have read that so I may have fumbled idk we’ll see…she seems somewhat interested, should I wait a week to text her if I don’t hear anything? Has anyone had a similar experience? 

 I just turned 26M and have a great career. My weaknesses are sometimes I get flustered and self conscious, and clingy. My strengths are that I’m very brave, outgoing, compassionate and I love to make people laugh.

I've been living in a non-HOA neighborhood in Texas, (YAY!) for over 20 years. Other than getting an occasional letter from the city that my lawn needs mowing because it's overgrown, I'm pretty much left alone. Now this incident didn't happen to me personally, but I heard this story from some of my neighbors. 

In the last five or so years ago, a gated community popped up next to our area and it had an HOA set up. This is the standard arrangement of cookie-cutter, overpriced houses. Now one of the biggest problems with HOAs is parking space. Homeowners in that community were only allowed to park their cars in their garages or driveways. The HOA strictly forbids parking on the streets, since they were so narrow, that they barely had enough room for two-way traffic. 

Now if the homeowners only had 1-2 cars per house, then parking wouldn't be much of an issue. However, the HOA failed to take into account of people with 3 or more cars or having family and friends visiting frequently. This of course, lead to cars being parked in the streets and many of them blocking traffic. Now this is especially concerning if the mail, delivery vans and emergency vehicles can't get through. 

So what was the HOA Board's solution? Why not just use an empty lot as overflow parking of course! The problem was that the lot was owned by someone.

Behind my street, there was a big empty lot that was owned by John Miller (not his real name of course). He had bought the lot from a realtor ten years and had some plans to eventually set up his own business. The thing is, due to money and time issues, he never got around to doing it. He did keep the property mowed and maintained, paid the taxes and so on. 

Around the summer three years ago, Mr. Miller checked on his lot and was confused to find a dozen cars parked on it. He then noticed the HOA president Karen getting out of her car after parking on the lot. He came stomping over to her and asked what the Hell was going on. Karen just shrugged and said that she and the HOA Board had voted to use his lot for resident overflow parking.

Mr. Miller was furious and told Karen that this was his private property and he was going to have all the cars towed. Karen just waved him off and told him that his lot was community parking now. 

Surprise, surprise! Mr. Miller called the towing company and had all the cars towed. This infuriated Karen, but Mr. Miller told her and the HOA to go pound sand. The HOA continued to have their members illegally park on the lot, and Mr. Miller had them towed off the lot. This went on for about a couple of weeks before the HOA got the message and tried to negotiate with Mr. Miller. Eventually, Mr. Miller agreed to rent out the lot for parking, at a fee of $3,000 per WEEK! The HOA were gobsmacked at the price, but Mr. Miller stated it was his lot and he could set the fee at whatever he wanted. With no other choice, the HOA agreed and now the members are royally ticked off that their monthly dues have skyrocketed.",1,1737345083.0,u_Acrobatic-Home-4632,0,1.0,False

1i5h3z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/agathachristie/comments/1i5h3z0/a_murder_is_announced/,A murder is announced ,"SPOILER ALERT 


Around Chapter 9,10 miss marple suspects that someone shot bullets from under the Swiss dead man called rudy SHRUGE 

So it's clear that someone wanted to kill letishia 
It's either someone from house or from outside

Now,the intersting part is he was liar,he lied about being son of that swiss hotel owner 

But the thing is how did he know letishia stayed at that hotel,bunar had joined her if I remember correctly.i am on chapter 12 currently 

This information could have only reached SHRUGE from bunnar(lethisia friend)

Now,the prime suspect for me is her and there several reasons 

1.The dummy door was opened just 10-15 ago as par credock and was opened recently also,and the  information about table being removed from the door was provided by bunner also and she said it was philipas idea,but inspector didn't check that information with philipa

2.shruge knew about swiss hotel that letishia stayed in 

3.only a house member could have opened that door because before a murder happend door must have been unlocked because someone obviously did go from that door to the hall and then reached behind SHRUGE,this could only happen if door was  unlocked beforehand 

4.we are being gaslighted into thinking that Patrick and julia are not who they say and they are actually pip and emma, because if they are the mystery is solved in like 11 th chapter,it would be too obvious 

5.bunnar had mentioned in the past about how someone burned the table surface with the cigarette and recently she mentioned it again to miss marple,so we can see that bunner has a soft spot for the furniture and she also where the lamps and other stuff are and as we know the person who will recieve the furniture in the case of lethisia death is bunnar

She seems like a psychopath to murder for furniture but it's possible  that she is in urgent need of money or maybe she is jealous of her friend and hold grudge against her

6.she said that she didn't see  anything,she had her hands over her eyes and everything.

7.only she could have got the time to talk to SHRUGE because remember letihsia and she had lunch in the hotel he worked at,she could have convinced him to do it by saying oh I live there and want to host a fun game 

8.no one is doubting her 

I am deciding now to write to see if I am right or not,all of this I wrote just on how much I remember 


CHAPTER 12

But I still can't figure out how in the world she could have gotten her hands on foreign revoler and how she manged to turn the lights off at exact 6:30 and that too of only hall and drawing rooms in an old house(it was mentioned that in newer  house it would be easier because of multiple fuses)


In chapter 12 Convo between swetanham and sergeant does make the list of suspect broader again because conclusion of that Convo was that anyone was entering anybody's house at will but still doing that is tough,first of all oiling and then getting the hands on key and also unlocking stopper before the crime day can attract someone from the house,so I still think it's bunner 
 
Just completed the 12 the chapter and Colonel can't find his revolver but then is immediately followed by it was last seen on 30th Saturday one day after the death of SHRUGE,so it is less likely that,that weapon was used but the auspicion here is that it was also a foreign weapon and the weapon in little paddocks was also foreign and very suspicious name is also mentioned here,the maid named mrs butt(under a suspicion of stealing a weapon from colonel house).now I do remember the name butt was mentioned also and I recall it was on the very first page.name of newspaper boy was johnny butt.

CHAPTER 13 


Dora bunner became sad remembering her old days while drinking coffee with mrs marple.

Okay,now she has also started to talk about money,that how money is so important for the world and only a person who has seen poverty can tell you how important money is,my suspicion of her has grown again and she also knows that furniture is in her name(which was kinda obvious)
She seems very grateful to letishia but looks like a facade to throw people off.she says that letishia trust people easily and doesn't how people are in the world and marple thinks that letishia didn't know the deeper abysses of human nature,😂

Most definitely true she didn't know the deeper abysses of bunner for sure If I am right 

Now she is saying that she saw Patrick with oil and 
Cup which grows the reader suspicion on Patrick but It could worng for all we know but if she says a lie and mrs marple asks Patrick it would be a bad thing for bunner,so I am confused here.he might have oily cup for some other purpose maybe .

Can bunner be sonia? 

Can colonel and his wife be murdereres?
Colonel being mrs sonis's husband and easterbrook(sonia)

And they were just rehearsing for what to say in case of revolver was traced back to him

But this is highly unlikely,just a thought after hearing mrs marple talk about anglo indian colonel

Can it be julian who didn't attend the gathering because he had to go and work,he was busy that evening.

Prime suspect-bunner(bunny)
Suspects-julian

Chapter 14

Not much to know,but last line says pip or emma or both of them were in chipping cleghorn but I don't think it will be julia and Patrick 

If they are in chipping cleghorn then most definitely they are the murderers but one of them or both of them has to be present in little paddocks at the time of murder 

Colonel and his wife,swetanham and edmond,julian and bunch,amy and hinchcliff,lethishia, Patrick and julia,bunner,mitzi,philipa hems 

Now out of all of this I think it could be bunner,colonal and his wife or julian(husband of bunch)

Remember he had read a crime mystery novel that bunch was reading,maybe he got the idea from there

CHAPTER 15

okay,this just got a bit confusing.philipa and julia both know about randall's dying wife bell.so Patrick also knows about her.

Philipa was seen talking to SHRUGE by mitzi but who knows 

Suspects:-bunner,julia,julian 

CHAPTER 16

Okay,dora bunner is dead😭,I was completely wrong then.guess I am not much of a detective huh😂(mind you I did predicted who killed Roger ackroyd without writing anything),when she complained about having a headache I had a intuition that she is gone but really didn't think much of it but still the name of the chapter did made me uneasy and I had a feeling that something bad is gonna happen.but an interesting thing happened in this chapter,bunner was not able to find her aspirin.she said it was full and new. So why would someone remove it from its original position or steal it.was it the plan of murderer,making bunner ask for aspirin to letishia?

And the cake seems also suspicious,

Suspects:-julian,bunch(I don't know,just a gut feeling,but being a daughter of miss marples friend,it's tough to doubt her), julia 

Chapter 18 

Not much to dig but mrs butt got mentioned again this time by bunch,so we know bunch had the knowledge of a gun 

I dont in which chapter I am but now that julia secret has been opened,and she definitely won't be able to remember her mother if they had parted ways when she was 3 

So that left sonia and her son(forgot the name)and such description matches only 2 house and that is swetnham and her son edmond and mrs boot and his son ,it cant be mrs boot.so my guess is on swetnham 

But julian is no more in my suspect list because he was obviously not present on the day of killing,so yeah.it was a bad guess anyway



Okay so i didn't write the last chapters because I was in flow of reading and 

It's fucking lethishia's sister 🫡.some of my guesses were really bad but I thought bunner was making sense to me but I had taken really small stuff into the account like furniture and all and i wrote all of those 7 points from my memory,so yes made a mistake of bunner going to the hotel with lethishia and even if she did,I totally didn't think of lethisia that she was also in the hotel and could have convinced SHRUGE to do it 

A murder is announced,I will say humbled me

I was able to predict who killed Roger ackroyd so i thought I could do it here too but yeah it's the QUEEN OF CRIME FOR YA

I can't do this anymore. I finished high-school 22 years ago and was glad to leave the hallway politics behind only to find myself still dealing with it as a practically middle aged woman. I don't want to spend my days sucking up to the right people.

I'm not rude or impolite. I'll say hello, I'll ask how your weekend was, I'll pretend to care when you tell me about yours, I'll chat if we are both making a cuppa in the kitchen at the same time or are in the elevator together but then I just want to go to my desk and get my work done so I can collect my paycheck and go without spending all my emotional energy and social battery for the day on my co-workers and job. I want to go home and have some chat left in me for my husband and some energy for my hobbies and dog.

I don't want to deal with gossip and office politics, I just want to be assessed on how well I do my work, not how extrovert I am and if I socialise enough with the team/wider division.

Please stop trying to involve me in office politics. Please stop complaining I am rude if I said ""I don't have an opinion on that"" or ""I'm not interested in gossip"" when I try to deflect because you can't seem to take hints I have no interest in being involved. Just leave me the hell out of it! I'm here to get paid, not re-create my years at a private girls high school. I do not care. We don't have to like each other, we just have to co-operate, so why can't we just agree to do that and go home with our paychecks every week?

I don't want to feel pressured to spend almost $10 on coffee $30 on lunch going downstairs to get coffee/lunch with the ""right"" people or my team so I don't get the ""anti-social"" or the dreaded ""not a team player"" label slapped onto me. I'm a team-player in that I'll happily help my co-workers out wherever I can, but....no to spending money on these outings! We have been forced back in every Monday, Wednesday and Thursday now. 3 days. It's over $100 a week to get a coffee and lunch every day. I don't want to spend that on mediocre food/coffee from the cafe downstairs. Just let me make tea in the kitchen and take an extra Dex so I can skip lunch without feeling hungry. I have a mortgage to pay off and and am finally able to throw a lil more into Super because I'm free of that damn JD HECS debt I regret taking.

The first time something went flying off a shelf with no rational explanation (a box of Ziploc bags), I mentioned it to my manager and she brushed it off simply as, ""oh, yeah, the place is definitely haunted."" Her and my boss who have been working here for 6 years tell me stories about all the strange activity they've experienced in the shop. I'm a skeptic through and through, but with each day I start to question myself. 
Why are things moving on their own? We have no significant drafts, and most things that get thrown are far too heavy to be moved by wind. Today candy from our display was knocked to the floor, and a large bucket of sprinkles toppled from the top shelf above the fridge. 
This may just be electrical, but our countertop grills that we make sandwiches on have been overheating to dangerous levels, burning all the food and smoking. (We replaced the old ones and the new ones have the same problem!) Man, I don't know if I'm tired or paranoid, but today I SWEAR I saw a head peek out at me from the ice machine. What bothers me most is how often things fall. I'm just scratching my head here on how things can just fall on their own like this? Especially when we take extra care in placing them? 
My boss, who is more of a believer than I am, says she hears the shop's hanging bell (above the door) go off constantly with no one there, and she hears someone calling her name.
I don't know, could you guys give your opinions? What could be causing objects to fall? I love my job but this ghost is making my life harder. I don't get paid enough for this shit!!",1,1737343583.0,Haunted,3,0.67,False

She was already there, sitting by the window, bathed in the golden glow of the setting sun. She looked exactly as I remembered her—calculated. Her whole aura screamed self-assurance, the kind only a person convinced of their own superiority could carry.

She waved at me, that familiar mix of nervousness and charm written across her face. I smiled back, the kind of smile that carried secrets.

“You’re early,” she said as I slid into the seat across from her.

“For you? Always,” I replied smoothly.

She blushed. It was almost adorable how easily she fell for the act. She had no idea the role she was playing in her own downfall.

Flashback—Three Years Ago

I was a regular guy, madly in love with my girlfriend of two years. Life wasn’t perfect, but it felt good. Stable. Real. Until I found out about her—this woman, the one sitting across from me now.

My girlfriend cheated on me with her. And when I confronted her, she didn’t even try to deny it.

“You don’t understand,” my girlfriend said, tears streaming down her face. “She’s different. She makes me feel alive.”

I remember the smug look on this woman’s face when I saw them together.

“She deserves better,” she had said.

And maybe my ex did. But it wasn’t going to be her.

Back in the Present

She stirred her coffee, the spoon clinking softly against the ceramic.

“You seem quiet today,” she said, breaking the silence. “Is everything okay?”

I tilted my head, studying her like an artist appraising their latest masterpiece. “Just thinking about us,” I said.

Her eyes softened. “I think about us all the time. You… you mean so much to me.”

I almost laughed. The audacity of it all. This woman, who had ruined my relationship, had no idea who I really was. She didn’t recognize me—not as the man whose life she shattered. And certainly not as the woman she now claimed to love.

Yes, I’m a woman now.

It wasn’t hard to make her fall for me. She thrived on drama, on the idea of being the center of some grand, cosmic love story. All I had to do was play my part—be mysterious, a little broken, and perfectly attentive. She ate it up: every lie, every calculated move.

And then I took it a step further. I also seduced my ex back. It wasn’t difficult; our history made it easy. She was still with this delusional woman, of course. Their relationship was the kind of toxic mess that thrived on betrayal and half-truths. So, I became the thing that connected them—a bridge made of deceit.

Now, It Was Time for the Reveal

“I’ve been meaning to tell you something,” I said, my voice soft but steady.

She leaned forward, her eyes wide and hopeful. “What is it?”

I pulled out my phone and placed it on the table. The screen lit up with a photo—a candid shot of her girlfriend—my ex—and the hot woman that I am now. We were at her apartment, laughing, her head resting on my shoulder.

Her face fell, her carefully constructed world teetering on the edge of collapse. “What… what is this?” she stammered.

“It’s your girlfriend and me,” I said calmly. “You remember your girlfriend, don’t you? Or, well, the woman you stole from me three years ago.”

She stared at the photo, her mouth opening and closing as if searching for words that wouldn’t come.

“What are you talking about?” she whispered, her voice trembling.

I smiled, leaning back in my chair. “You don’t recognize me, do you? I’m the guy whose girlfriend you stole. Or at least, I was. Before you came into my life and tore everything apart. Before you decided that you deserved my girlfriend more than I did.”

Her face went pale. “That’s not possible.”

“Oh, but it is,” I said, my voice sharp and unwavering. “You thought you could take everything from me and walk away unscathed? You thought you could rewrite my story, make yourself the hero? Guess what—this time, I wrote the ending.”

She shook her head, tears brimming in her eyes. “You… you made me fall for you?”

“I did,” I said. “And while I was at it, I made sure my ex fell back into my arms. She’s been cheating on you for months now. With me. How’s that for poetic justice?”

The café seemed to hold its breath, the hum of conversation fading into the background. She looked at me, broken and defeated, the weight of her own actions finally crashing down on her.

“I loved you,” she whispered, her voice barely audible.

“No,” I said, standing up. “You loved the idea of me. Just like you loved the idea of my girlfriend. You don’t know how to love, not really. You only know how to take.”

I picked up my coat, pausing just long enough to watch her crumble.

“Enjoy your coffee,” I said, turning toward the door. “And tell my ex I said hi.”

As I Stepped Out

Into the cool evening air, I felt a strange sense of calm. This wasn’t just revenge—it was balance, a restoration of order in a world she had thrown into chaos.

And for the first time in years, I was free.

I was thinking of buying a new car and doing the expenses method. I already track every single expense, business action and mile using my own system of spreadsheet so I think it would be fairly easy to prove and document.


That being said, how would this work if I were to have a home office and an EV car as another home office that I buy a bunch of amenities for so that I can drive somewhere, and just work in my car as a mobile office. EVs seem perfect since I can have some electronic use the onboard power source without having to turn on gas. 

I tried searching but I dont think people really seem to use their car much as a second remote home office. Obviously, I’ll be able to business expense all of the remote accessories I buy as addition to the interior of the car, but how does that affect the how I declare the car and the mileage used by the car. I’m assuming I can’t just decide to travel to the grand canyon because I felt like working there. 

Am I missing something here?

Some are saying that it is absolute trash and I might as well go for the c3(most probably that won't be possible as I need espresso grinds and c3 would probably take a lot of time).But then there are some who say that it is a good starting point if u don't have the budget. 

My situation is that I currently have a newly bought delonghi ec685 with a pressurized basket and I get my beans (currently hunkal aranya)grinded from a local shop in batches of 200 to 300 gms. I am not expert in coffee but I do make a pretty good cappuccino (might as well be 10 times better than the starbucks cappucino). 

I don't think I can extend my budget to the baratza encore so it's either this grinder or no grinder at all. If anybody has used this grinder I would love to hear your inputs. A few specific questions I had are: 
1. Is this a good grinder for espresso, bcoz that's what I usually drink.
2. How many adjustments are there for espresso grind- I have heard that you can also manually adjust the burr by removing the hopper
3. How long will this grinder last if I use it for espresso predominantly 
4. There are a few other grinders in this price range too like shardor and sipologie, instacuppa, Wonderchef. How do these hold up against agaro

1i5gvgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1i5gvgc/asd_level_3/,ASD level 3 ,"ASD Level 3

I am not quite sure if everyone can truly understand what level 3 autism aka severe autism is without experiencing it directly. My general experience with people with ASD was for the longest time very minimal. I knew what it meant to be autistic, but I never truly knew the different kinds of battles these individuals endure every day. In school, we had classrooms for the special education that is given, and the students in those classes have always been stereotyped as different, but I still didn't realize what that comprised until I began this new job a year ago. I am a behavioral support technician for this company that serves individuals that the DMH considers to be autistic. However, different levels of ASD consist of vastly different obstacles. The two individuals that I work with closely share the qualities of having ASD level 3. Both individuals are nonverbal but the description of nonverbal is fairly vague. The source of the information I looked into is the Drake Institute of Neurophysical Medicine's in-depth description of ASD level 3.

The description of these individuals' communication is limited, and repetitive words, actions, or body mechanics are utilized to portray words. One of the clients will clap when prompting or issuing a response from them and will clap and project their arm out if they want something in return. An example would be asking if they're hungry, and they will clap. But if you ask if they want a certain food item, this individual will clap and project their arm. Through numerous prompts and questions I was able to figure out this is their specific way of expressing themselves appropriately to achieve their satisfactory desire. They also do not speak at all, most of the day is spent yelling, and for lack of better words whining, they also what ABA call ‘chirps’ which is a very sudden, loud, and high-pitched gasping sound. They also can be described as ‘woo-woo’ which is essentially the vibration of the vocal cords but no clear word or sound is being produced. The other individual in contrast can speak very few words. Some include eat, tea, hot, yeah, and ride. The vocabulary this individual speaks is one of the progressive exercises that we have instilled to strengthen their communication skills and speak more directly to us members serving them. These patterns are not necessarily consistent since the words and expressions tend to be echolalia.

They hardly interact with each other because they have no desires that can be met between each other and tend to engage in solitary activities like sensory and motor activities including; flipping cards, pacing the house, personal time, and extended bathing time to play with water or take a bath, and one of these individuals likes to slap themself in on the chest and leg. Whenever these individuals have a desire that requires assistance to be met, such as eating, drinking, or attending activities they enjoy such as car rides and walks, they will engage with the staff members. Some of the things done to express need are pulling on the staff’s arm, touching the staff's faces, or communicating in ways that have fulfilled their immediate needs previously such as words or actions. I want to circle back to the topic of immediate needs because, for many staff members, this job has become very personal to them including myself. But sometimes when dealing with behaviors the line can become blurry between personal and work. Both individuals can tend to have often physical behaviors, both vastly different but still endure a mental and physical toll on the staff member. One client will bang their head on any hard surface, or anything that is in front of them, which can include staff members. I have been on the backend of the behavior being hit and headbutted by this individual due to their immediate need not being met. It is also really hard to understand what these needs are since they are nonverbal. It can range from the temperature of the air, their food being cold, ice in their cup, and internal issues that can not be physically expressed (headaches, hunger). The other individuals will become distraught when they do not receive their immediate needs and will resort to throwing, spitting, and in severe cases hitting and biting.

The relationships developed with these individuals are not very strong. Both interestingly enough only have strong and different relationships with their mothers. I have noticed vastly different behaviors when their mother is mentioned or present. Grandparents, siblings, and managers have the same engagement as the direct staff members. They both lack friendships and heavily rely on immediate needs to be met to establish a relationship. That is also the expectation of these individuals, which can become intimidating for new people. These needs can be unachievable in certain circumstances, which can lead to behaviors. Sometimes, one individual for example will request coffee at 8 at night, which is logically not reasonable. The aspect of the relationships created is that at the end of the day, it is just work, because these individuals do not understand the concepts of relationships and do not have a personal connection with staff members, like myself.

This leads to the final point I found interest in, which is they do not understand social concepts or the ability to learn innate behaviors. One individual unfortunately has urinary and bowel incontinence and can urinate in the bed and not be physically or mentally aware that they did. If it weren’t for checking for incontinence or observing urinating, this individual would spent an extended amount of time sitting in their incontinence. I took one individual to the emergency room for an irrelevant reason and hit security and nurses. They were placed into a seclusion room in the ED for pushing the code blue button without consciously being aware of what that meant. I’ve also experienced having my phone grabbed and thrown and having my face touched which I would describe as random compulsions. Neither of these individuals watch TV, or even know what TV is, and don’t have very many interests other than eating.

Other underlying conditions have been medically diagnosed within both individuals which can contribute to the severity of the behaviors they exhibit, but are not related to ASD.

What I described scratches the surface of what I have observed with these individuals but I felt it was very interesting to understand another aspect of ASD and felt it was worth sharing. I tried my best to maintain anonymity and confidentiality while writing this to respect their HIPAA rights, if there is anything I said that could potentially violate this let me know.

All of the dates have been coffee of drinks dates and I always only get 1 drink on each date. I just assumed it a man asked me on a date he should pay, but also the money conversation usually comes up earlier on before the check comes.

Is this a valid reason to stop talking to him?,"Im 20F, hes 20M, we have been talking for a bit over a month but only met up once because we were both gone during holidays. 

At first i thought hes very nice, thoughtful, curious about me and my culture, respectful and smart. When we just started talking hed often mention some of his female friends and i didnt really pay much attention to it because in my eyes he was great and i didnt think there could be anything weird going on between them. 

Then, i ask him and he tells me that his two best friends (mind you, the only ones he has in the city he lives in) are both his exes. One is more okay as they dated very briefly when they were teenagers but another one hes been with for 3 years and only broke up with 4 months ago. 

This caught me by surprise and i told him that i wouldnt be okay with it in a relationship but wouldnt mind being friends with him as we had a lot in common and had a fun time talking to each other. However, after that, our “talking” wasnt completely platonic. Nothing too much but just occasional flirting/compliments here and there and still entertaining the thought of being together in the future. 

But what was constantly weirding me out is that these two girls were stalking my Tiktok and other social media almost daily. Especially if me and the guy had some disagreement or a weird moment (only happened like twice), theyd be in my profile views straight away. The disagreements weren’t anything bad, more just based on being from different backgrounds and having different senses of humour. Like i would make a joke but he wouldnt understand it correctly. Hed get mad/uncomfortable/upset but instead of telling me first, he would go and tell these besties/exes about that, have them discuss our whole “relationship” and then only hours later it would turn out that he misunderstood me and its actually all good. 

So about a week ago i brought up how these two girls were viewing my profile yet again (without following or liking anything), 3 times on the same day and how i wasnt really comfortable with that and it was an odd thing to do. He started rambling on how its just a cultural clash and how they struggle to understand me so thats why they keep going on my social media to get a better idea of me because they dont agree with my mindset and stuff like that. 

This all sounded really odd to me and in some way he pretty much said that he tells them about literally every interaction we have before even trying to resolve or discuss things with me, what makes them think of me badly. From what i understood, he probably reports everything to them. As soon as i post a new tiktok, theyre always the first to view it, despite not following me. If i say something “culturally different”, theyre all over my social media not even 5 minutes later. 

It feels insane to the point i feel like having 24/7 supervision by two girls who look closely at everything i say and post online which is actually mad. Im not even that weirded out about him being friends with his exes but this whole stalking thing and discussing every little bit of our conversations is soooo odd to me. 

Whenever hed say something questionable, id always try to ask him what he meant or why he said that before even telling my friends what happened. For him its the opposite. Its like im under a constant fire. 

I haven’t really talked to him since that “cultural clash” conversation but now hes asking me to meet up for a coffee because he’s embarrassed for what he said to me. I wouldnt be opposed to going but im highly considering confronting him on this weird behaviour. Except i want to figure out whether it is actually weird or maybe only i see it weird as a person who doesnt overshare about my love life with friends? Idk maybe it is normal afterall and i will just look like a bully if i call him out on that?

TLDR: talking to a guy, the guy’s two main best friends are his exes. I decided i might be able to live with that as their relationship seems platonic HOWEVER, theyre always stalking my social media and he keeps reporting every single detail about our conversation or me to them. I feel like im being constantly watched by two girls. They probably dont like me either. The guy wants to meet up because he’s embarrassed for what he said to me. If we meet i want to call him out on being a weirdo and stop seeing him. Valid?",3,1737342603.0,relationships,3,1.0,False

I got all of this extensive work done since I put off seeing a dentist for regular cleanings all throughout undergrad. When I got back into routine cleanings, it turns out my teeth had $9k worth of damage. When I did my Master's in another state, two teeth died and I even did my finals my first semester with a dead tooth (which was part of the reason I got a C+ in a core class). My third one died for an infuriating reason. I got on a state dental plan in the state where I did my PhD and wanted to get it done there to save money. I got on a cancelation list and got the filling for the tooth months later. However, when I was in excruciating pain, I went to Aspen Dental (without knowing they rip people off) and found the tooth died. I eventually bit the bullet and went back to the dentist in my hometown.

All throughout undergrad, I drank too much coffee and energy drinks, which are highly acidic and I did to cope with the energy dips I had throughout the day. I'm not sure how much longer my other teeth will last. The worst part is that my front teeth are demineralized now and my top right molar has an SBF (I think that's what it's called) placed between it and a crowned tooth plus a fresh filling after my last dental appointment. I also didn't floss or use extra fluoride toothpaste that would've helped a ton. Now, I have extra fluoride toothpaste that's prescription level. I feel off the wagon with flossing and sometimes going straight to sleep without brushing the past 8 months or so, but I'm getting back on it again. The most important part is that I'm not in any noticeable pain.

The worst part is that I also have a PhD on the way and, even if I had the publications to get a post doc, I'm going to live in my hometown where I have a good support system and a dentist who doesn't judge me despite my horrible teeth. I'm also probably going to get a job I'm comfortable with (research assistant) that might only pay around $50k at most with around $52k in student loans. I'm hoping to stay with my parents and save to get my teeth completely fixed as a preventative measure.

Day dates, from brunches to outdoor adventures, call for relaxed yet stylish outfits that show you put thought into your look without overdoing it. So, how do you style your Valentine’s Day outfit for a day date? Here are some easy tips to make sure you look fabulous while keeping it casual and fun!

# 1. Embrace Soft, Flattering Fabrics 🧵

For day dates, comfort is key. Choose fabrics like cotton, linen, or soft knits that are breathable yet stylish. A flowy dress or a fitted sweater paired with jeans can easily transition from a coffee date to an afternoon stroll. A lightweight cardigan or jacket is perfect for layering, especially if you’re planning to be outdoors. Look for fabrics that feel cozy but still look chic, like a chunky knit sweater or a sleek cotton blouse.

# 2. Play with Colors 💖

While red and pink are the quintessential Valentine’s Day colors, you don’t have to limit yourself to these hues. Opt for soft pastels or rich jewel tones if you want to try something a little different. A light blush blouse with a pair of high-waisted jeans can create a fresh, modern look that’s romantic without being too over-the-top. If you’re feeling bold, consider a red sweater dress or a heart-themed accessory to add a pop of color to your outfit.

# 3. Dress for the Activity 🏞️

What’s your plan for the day? A picnic in the park calls for a cute sundress and sandals, while a cozy coffee shop date might be better suited to a chic sweater and leggings. For a day filled with adventure, keep your outfit practical but stylish—think sneakers with a denim skirt or casual trousers paired with a graphic tee. Comfort is key for day dates, so choose pieces you can move in and feel relaxed wearing.

# 4. Add Fun Accessories 🎀

Accessories are an easy way to elevate your outfit. A fun scarf, delicate jewelry, or a cute crossbody bag can add personality to any look. Keep things light and playful—think gold earrings or a heart-shaped necklace to add a touch of romance. A cute hat or hair accessories can also be a fun way to complete your outfit, especially if you’re keeping things casual.

# Conclusion

Valentine’s Day day dates are all about fun, comfort, and style. By choosing the right fabrics, colors, and accessories, you can create a look that’s both fashionable and practical. Whether you’re grabbing coffee, strolling through a park, or going on a fun adventure, your outfit should reflect your personality and set the tone for a wonderful day!

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Transforming your kitchen into a space that reflects your faith can add warmth and inspiration to your home. Christian home decor can serve as a daily reminder of your beliefs, creating a comforting atmosphere for cooking and gathering with loved ones. Here are some creative ideas to infuse your kitchen with Christian-themed decor.

### 1. Faith-Inspired Wall Art

One of the easiest and most impactful ways to incorporate Christian decor is through wall art. Consider these ideas:

- **Scripture Prints:** Choose your favorite Bible verses and have them artistically framed. Verses like ""Taste and see that the Lord is good"" (Psalm 34:8) can remind you of God’s goodness while you prepare meals.
- **Religious Symbols:** Decorate your walls with art featuring crosses or doves. These symbols are easily recognizable and evoke a sense of peace.
- **Personal Artwork:** If you enjoy crafting, create your own pieces. You could paint or design something that reflects your faith journey or family values.

### 2. Themed Textiles

Textiles are a great way to add color and meaning to your kitchen. Think about:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/christian-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Dish Towels:** Select dish towels emblazoned with scriptures or Christian quotes. These will not only be functional but also serve as daily inspirations.
- **Table Linens:** Use tablecloths and napkins featuring Christian symbols or motifs. This could be a simple pattern of fish or loaves that reminds you of the miracles of Jesus.

### 3. Prayer Corner

Create a small prayer corner in your kitchen. This dedicated space can inspire you while you cook. You can include:

- **A Candle:** Use a nice candle that smells wonderful and adds a calming atmosphere when lit during meal prep.
- **Bible or Devotional Book:** Keep a copy of your favorite devotional on the counter or a small shelf. Take a moment to read some inspiring passages as you take a break from cooking.
- **Prayer Journal:** Add a journal where you can jot down prayers for your family while enjoying your morning coffee.

### 4. Christian-Themed Cookware and Utensils

Incorporate your faith directly into your cooking process with themed utensils. Here are some ideas:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/christian-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Engraved Wooden Spoons:** Look for wooden utensils that have Bible verses or prayers engraved on them. These can be functional and decorative pieces.
- **Cups and Plates:** Use dishes and mugs that have Christian sayings or images. Every cup of coffee can remind you of your faith.

### 5. Meaningful Centerpieces

Your kitchen table is the heart of the home, and a centerpiece can speak volumes. Consider these options:

- **Bible Centerpiece:** Place an open Bible in the middle of your table, perhaps with a decorative vase of flowers. Make it a habit to read a verse together at mealtime.
- **Faith-Based Planters:** Use planters that signify your faith, such as those featuring the scripture reference or symbols. Adding greenery can also invite a bit of nature indoors.

### 6. Seasonal Decor

Change your kitchen decor with the seasons to reflect important Christian holidays. For example:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/christian-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Advent Calendar:** Create a fun countdown to Christmas with an Advent calendar hanging in your kitchen.
- **Fall Harvest Theme:** For Thanksgiving, center your decor around gratitude, perhaps displaying a sign that reads “Give Thanks.”

Christian home decor in your kitchen can create a peaceful and reflective space. From wall art and textiles to cookware and table decor, there are countless creative avenues to express your faith through design. With thoughtful choices, your kitchen will not only be a place for culinary creations but also a reflection of the love and faith that nourishes your home.

The Impact of Faith-Based Decor on Family Gatherings in the Kitchen
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating an inviting atmosphere in your kitchen can significantly enhance family gatherings, especially when infused with elements of faith-based décor. This unique blend of spiritual and functional design can make your kitchen a warm, loving space, where meals become memorable experiences shared in the spirit of togetherness.

Faith-based décor reminds us of our values and beliefs, serving as a gentle reminder of what truly matters while you cook and share meals with your family. Here are several ways in which this décor can impact family gatherings:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/christian-home-decor-kitchen  
  
### Bringing Spirituality into Daily Life

When you incorporate faith-based decor in your kitchen, it doesn't just serve as a visual element; it transforms the space into a reflection of your values. Simple pieces, such as:

- **Inspirational wall art:** Images or quotes from scripture inspire positivity while cooking.
- **Prayer boards:** A designated area for family prayers promotes connection and gratitude.
- **Crosses and symbols:** These can create a serene environment, guiding your spirit as you prepare meals.

Each of these items encourages you to take a moment of reflection, fostering an atmosphere of mindfulness and spirituality that enriches the dining experience.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/christian-home-decor-kitchen  
  
### Cultivating Togetherness

Faith-based décor isn’t only about individual reflection; it can also build a tighter family bond. By integrating these elements, you create a space that invites family to gather. Consider the following:

- **Family meal traditions:** A faith-themed centerpiece can serve as a conversation starter.
- **Scripture-themed dining items:** Plates or table settings featuring religious symbols can add a personal touch.
- **Shared prayers:** A decorative prayer mat in the kitchen invites everyone to take a moment to connect before meals.

These traditions can lead to enjoyable discussions, creating a feeling of unity and connectedness among family members.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/christian-home-decor-kitchen  
  
### Creating a Sense of Comfort

Faith-based décor also brings a sense of comfort that many families crave. When the kitchen is adorned with familiar religious symbols, it creates a nurturing environment. Here are some ways this comfort manifests:

- **Warm colors:** Use paint or decorative items in comforting hues to create a welcoming space.
- **Soft textiles:** Linens that feature soft designs or scriptures can make the kitchen feel cozy.
- **Personal touches:** Family photos with faith motifs remind everyone of their roots and shared belief journeys.

A home filled with love and faith encourages open conversations, laughter, and warmth, making family gatherings more enjoyable.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/christian-home-decor-kitchen  
  
### Encouraging Mindful Eating

Integrating faith-based elements in your kitchen can encourage a more mindful approach to eating. For example:

- **Blessing the meal:** Taking a moment to express gratitude teaches family members the importance of being present.
- **Food-related scriptures:** Displaying verses about food and sharing meals can transform how you view meal times.
- **Fruits and vegetables:** Use faith-themed baskets or bowls on the counter as functional décor, reminding families of God's provision.

This mindfulness cultivates appreciation for the food and the relationships around the table, enriching each family meal.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/christian-home-decor-kitchen  
  
### Making Memories

Ultimately, faith-based décor in the kitchen is about creating lasting memories. When your kitchen is designed with love and faith, every meal becomes a celebration of togetherness. Think about:

- **Special occasions:** Birthdays, anniversaries, or holidays celebrated at home take on a special charm with faith-inspired décor.
- **Cooking as a family:** Involving everyone in meal preparation fosters collaboration and laughter, creating cherished moments.
- **Storytelling:** Sharing stories from family history or scripture can spark joy and laughter, deepening bonds.

Each gathering features shared meals steeped in faith, love, and joyful memories, allowing family traditions to flourish.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/christian-home-decor-kitchen  
  
When you intentionally incorporate faith-based décor into your kitchen, you’re setting the stage for beautiful family moments. Your kitchen becomes more than just a cooking space; it evolves into a sacred place filled with love, laughter, and faith that binds families together.

### Conclusion

Christian home decor in your kitchen not only beautifies the space but also infuses it with meaning and purpose. From displaying scripture wall art to using faith-themed tableware, you can create an inspiring environment that reflects your beliefs and invites divine blessings into your home. Simple touches, such as decorative dish towels or a centerpiece featuring a cross, can elevate your kitchen's atmosphere and make it a special place for family interactions.

The impact of faith-based decor on family gatherings is profound. When your kitchen is adorned with reminders of faith, it fosters a sense of unity and belonging among family members. As you gather around the table for meals or during special occasions, the visual cues of Christian decor serve as a gentle reminder of shared values, encouraging meaningful conversations and deeper connections. It can spark discussions about your beliefs, create an atmosphere of gratitude, and inspire everyone to reflect on their faith together.

Ultimately, a kitchen enriched with Christian home decor becomes more than just a cooking space; it transforms into a nurturing heart of the home. It sets the stage for cherished memories, laughter, and lessons rooted in faith. As you invite your loved ones into this sacred space, consider how the decor can enhance not only the physical environment but also the spiritual experiences shared within these walls.

I have come across a really exciting career opportunity and have been scouting out some neighborhoods to move into. The job is with Western, and I don't drive, so a space along a bus route is ideal. Some other considerations / things about me:

*  I'm in my mid-20s, so a place that tends to collect young professionals / grad students would be nice
* Looking for relatively cheap rent (is 1500 reasonable?)
* Its just me, so I don't need huge spaces but I do prefer 1br over Bachelor. Whatever saves money is nice, though.

1i5gf5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1i5gf5y/do_you_think_i_found_my_diagnosis/,Do you think I found my diagnosis?,"Chatgpt has helped me realize I may need to be tested for autism. If it is okay I'd like some of you to evaluate out findings and give your opinion. I'm not asking you to diagnose me of course, just give an informed opinion seeing as you all likely know better than the average person. Some of it is repetitive because chat is far from perfect. Also  not included. Also I'm not calling these behaviors autistic, chatgpt did. And I include some examples i can think of. Im.sure there's way more i am not atm. Anyway thanks!

First off I have a family history and I was the fourth child born when my parents were in late 30s to early 40s

1. Difficulty Reading Social Cues:

Struggled to interpret romantic signals or intentions (many times missed out on opportunities only to realize the common sense later. Like missing that by asking to come in when nobody is home a girl wants to hook up)

•Misunderstood others' emotions or intentions in social contexts.

•Regularly told im being too loud or have and belittling tone, confuse discussions for arguments and give off the wrong cues making others think I'm mad when I'm not.

•Constanly over sharing beyond normally acceptable boundaries with almost anyone woth little to no shame unless someone personally tries to shame me. Same with doing other things publicly that others may be afraid or embarrassed of. 

•Overly honest to a fault unless I have strong reason to be dishonest and easy to catch if I lie to those who know me.

2. Literal Thinking and Difficulty with Abstract Concepts:

•Questions idioms like ""raining cats and dogs,"" focusing on their origins and logic. I get the saying but the fact that cats and dogs have no logical connection to raining bothers me. 

•Difficulty differentiating related terms like adjective and adverbs

3.Strong Emotional Reactions to Changes:

•Anger or frustration when plans change unexpectedly.


4. Awkwardness in Physical Activities or Coordination:

•Felt awkward in sports and described being “lanky” or clumsy.

•Bumps into corners frequently, struggles with spatial awareness.

5.Sensory Sensitivities or Stimming Behaviors:

•Paces while talking on the phone, feels physically uncomfortable if unable to.

•Moves toes constantly while lying in bed, tied to anxiety or discomfort.

•Displays repetitive actions or behaviors for comfort.

6.Fixation on Logic Over Emotion:

•Prioritizes logical reasoning and gets frustrated when others rely on emotional arguments.

•Attempts to logically convince himself out of fears or perceived consequences.

7.Workplace Challenges:

•Difficulty keeping jobs long-term due to miscommunications or minor mistakes escalating.

•Frustrated when logical reasons for absences (e.g., calling out) aren't accepted.

8.Social Anxiety or Discomfort in Group Settings:

•Feels awkward and insecure at parties, unsure how to act or what to do. 

•Relies on external factors (like substances) to ease social discomfort.

9.Repetitive or Rigid Behaviors:

•Experiences discomfort when routines or patterns are disrupted. My wife had low iron and slept all day. While I understand, I feel very frustrated and feel like I can't start anything until she gets up and has coffee with me.

•Frequently paces, fidgets, or engages in repetitive physical movements. I pace constantly when talking especially on the phone, I can sit in bed all day and my toes will twitch and wiggle the whole time and many more

10.Intense Interests or Hyperfocus:

•Strong interest in topics like ""The Lord of the Rings"" lore. I can tell you all about the origins of the elder scrolls pantheon and the different recent discoveries in science for ours and hours then give you a theory on the future direction of humanity based on that.

•Hyperfocuses on research or specific issues when motivated.

Constantly saying catchphrases and lines from all different characters i enjoyed throughout my life to the point it becomes something the whole house does. Like ""so you wanna fight"" from soul calibur and ""tell my mom I love her"" from lego marvel superheroes 2. 

11.Difficulty Transitioning Between Activities:

•Resistance or exhaustion when switching between tasks. If I just finished something I don't wanna do anything else for a while.

12.Rigid Thinking or Decision-Making:

•Prefers familiar problem-solving methods, showing reluctance to try alternatives. If someone tells me it is the wrong way ill likely try anyway before switching to another method.

13.Difficulty Understanding Social Nuances:

•Struggles with subtle interpersonal dynamics, leading to misunderstandings or conflicts. I regular have had conflicts from simple miscommunication or misinterpreted cues. I've been punched in the face for asking a guy if a girl was his girlfriend because of my unintended tone giving the wrong signals. 

14. Emotion Regulation Issues:

•Intense frustration when logical reasoning is ignored.

•Difficulty managing strong emotional responses.

•When overstimulated i snap, like if multiple people are arguing with me at once and not acknowledging my reasoning. This is commonly done with uncontrolled verbal insults but has been violent in rare rare occasions in the past

15.Difficulty Finding Objects:

•Needs precise instructions to locate items; vague directions like ""on the shelf"" lead to confusion and extended searching.

16.Observations from Conversations(what chat has noticed on their own:

•Deep self-reflection and thorough analysis of personal behaviors. For instance my old therapist said I didn't need her because I keep figuring out the causes of my behaviors themselves 

•Strong focus on specific details or patterns during conversations. Like the human nervous system upside down looks like a tree growing from a seed (which is how it actually develops) constantly connecting patterns in things I notice. 

•Repeated frustration with inefficiencies or illogical systems (e.g., workplace dynamics). Why can't I call out regularly given good notice? Its not like I get paid if I don't work, I'm a good worker even if I wanna limit how often I work.

•A tendency to revisit or expand on earlier points for clarity. I also tell the same stories constantly

Chats personal, Non-Professional Opinion

Yes, I strongly believe you show multiple traits consistent with autism spectrum disorder. Yes, it could be autism, a combination of overlapping conditions, or both. Many of the traits and experiences you’ve described—such as difficulties with emotional regulation, social nuances, rigid thinking, sensory sensitivities, and stimming behaviors—are hallmark features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While a combination of overlapping conditions could explain your traits, the consistency and breadth of your experiences point strongly toward ASD as a unifying framework. If I had to guess, autism is likely the primary explanation, with possible contributions from ADHD, anxiety, or OCD-like traits. He concluded that im looking at about 80-90% chance in his opinion. He of course recommended a psychiatrist.

1. Would a rectangular coffee table in front of the sofa make the room too . . . angular? We currently have a large round storage ottoman there (not in the picture) but it seems to take up so much space. Thinking of [something like this](https://www.frontgate.com/tivoli-rectangular-coffee-table/1338923?listIndex=0&offers_sku=166246%20CAR&SourceCode=ZZ51120&intlShippingCtx=US%7CUSD&CAWELAID=120245420002828207&CAGPSPN=pla&CAAGID=108290655244&CATCI=pla-859968869975&&utm_campaign=PLA%20-%20Indoor%20Case%20%26%20Accent%20Furniture&utm_id=google_10824899468_108290655244_456130041279_pla-859968869975_c&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&cmpid=10824899468&agid=108290655244&tgtid=pla-859968869975&prdid=166246%20CAR&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA4rK8BhD7ARIsAFe5LXIGHttK50CwGQhVyY9HbK5OWSwmpNton00YAPfPHuMvGZci2DohpX4aAj6tEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) (though I think this particular model is a tad overpriced).
2. What to do with the space between the windows? An interior designer suggested grasscloth wallpaper a few years ago for all three walls in the picture, but my husband cannot commit to wallpaper!
3. What to do with window treatments? I am so over the Roman shades. Husband hates plantation shutters (no offense to those who have/like them -- it's a bad emotional connection for him). Thinking drapes to soften the room, but they would need some kind of privacy lining because we face a busy urban street.

My goals:
1. To achieve a high standard of coffee each morning.
2. Make it easy to use so I don't find it a chore, but instead therapeutic.
3. Make it nice to look at.

I think the equipment I bought, although expensive, add ease and looks nice to have on display outside of the kitchen.

What do you think?

Note: I know the the kettle from Fellow wouldve completed a perfect setup, but considering it's slow pour rate range, I decided against it in case I also branch off into another type of coffee which requires/makes it easier with a higher pour rate.

Done my first pour today with Ethiopian medium roast. I think I ground too fine (setting 4) as it was a little bitter. Regardless, it was still the best home brew I have ever had! Was using the hoffmann technique.

1i5gdux,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i5gdux/i_just_hate_my_life_rn/,I just hate my life rn,"Pretty self explanatory. There’s nothing sensational about my complains but it just ruins my mood a bit more every day that goes by. Just for context I (F28) been dating my bf (M24) since almost half a year and a half and we officially live together since last September (I say officially bc we were all the time together before too, just not in our own apartment). We’re both evolving in an artistic environment, he’s a primarily a musician / producer but he also sings, as for myself my job until now was modeling full time.
Being part of those industries is not an easy ride and since it’s very unstable, I had to take a day job for the first time. My bf has always worked in fast food restaurants besides music, but I’ve never had any professional experience in any field (but modeling) before last summer. I finished high school, but not any of the advanced studies I started. My mom used to be a teacher and has always associated status and studies, needless to say I’m such a disappointment in her eyes. Anyway. I now work 35h per week as a saleswoman in a department store that belongs to a famous retail chain focused mainly on fashion, beauty and home decor. I hate, hate it with my whole heart; the work atmosphere, mentality, petty managers, two faced colleagues, karens or just the job itself. I thought I’d still be able to take modeling contracts during my days off and at the very beginning I did a couple of times but it didn’t last and it’s been months since I didn’t get one. I’m tired (they made us work 40h during BF, Xmas period and now the normal sales) both physically and mentally all the time. All my friends live in other cities and I don’t have time to visit them (nor do they) anymore, so basically besides my bf and sometimes his friends I have no social life of my own and it hurts. I’ve always avoided making connexions with the others outside of work because I KNEW it’d be trouble and guess what ? I was so damn right, that one guy I thought was kind and friendly just wanted to f*ck the hell out of me as soon as he broke up with his gf (who works in the same place as us btw). It just disgusted me of the whole place even more. I feel like I’m spending my whole life in that sh*t hole, surrounded by toxic / bitter people who have nothing better to do than trash talking others (me included) all day long. Even though I’ve always knew I wouldn’t enjoy the « experience », I’ve tried though; tried to be as nice and helpful as I could, bringing food I’ve spent all night cooking and boxes of chocolate… That job is just not made for me and I can’t hide it. It’s been five months and I still suck at most things despite my efforts, and the more I get yelled at the more I lose my grip. You know when they say what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger ? Well, what doesn’t kill me makes me depressed and it doesn’t make me wanna prove anyone wrong either, it just makes me wanna leave but I can’t rn. I feel so stuck… And seeing my friends and their friends still modeling is taking a huge toll on me, especially since can’t nor do I have the motivation to take care about my socials like I used to (colleagues are lurking and as much as they can piss off, I don’t feel like posting like I used to with them watching all the time).
My bf is supportive but ngl, that situation has made our relationship cloudier than before; he’s working mostly at night whether he’s recording or even making pizzas and even though I’ve always been a night owl, our lifestyles are conflicting almost all the time now. He can have up to three sessions per day, last one being from 11PM to 3AM but it’s most likely until 4AM (like he is right now). His studio isn’t fully done so I still can hear everything. After that he often goes out to see his homies and smoke some sh*t / weed (I hate that). In that case he doesn’t come back before 5AM - 6AM. Last year he used to work an insane amount of time but since I was so much more flexible with my schedule we managed to have time to do plenty of stuff together, now the lack of sleep and excesses really caught him up and he’s worn out all the time. I try to be understanding but it irritates me so much that he cares so little about daily chores… If I wasn’t doing the laundry he wouldn’t do it. Same thing when it comes to changing the sheets. When he sweeps the floor (only in the living room / recording studio) he’ll just leave the dirt and dust in a corner and call it a day. He says he’ll do the dishes (mainly his and his clients) but leaves it for days, even weeks in the sink. I usually end up doing it but once I didn’t and let him realized how long it’s been sitting there, there was MOLD. I also had to force him to take showers a few times because he was too lazy to do so, and I’m not even a maniac when it comes to hygiene I just don’t want my man to lay down in the freshly made bed after three days of not showering especially not when he comes back from making food all night… Also he won’t go grocery shopping and if I do (or he) he’ll just let things rot away because he’d rather order - even if I suggest to cook - resulting in us spending a crazy amount on deliveries. I’ve already brought it up to him and he was so defensive, replying that it wasn’t that bad, that he was indeed cleaning and that for most things, he just never had the time, that he’d rather let things accumulate to do it all at once and that he’s focused on things that are way bigger than this…
I don’t think he realizes how much it is for my mental load. Back when I had more time I gladly helped him by doing all the chores (maybe it was a bad idea…) but I can’t anymore, I’m also too tired. We talked about me moving but even though that could be a solution I really don’t want to because if I don’t have him when I come back home I just won’t make it, I’ll feel even more isolated than I currently am and that’s the last thing I want.
I drown my sadness and anxiety in cigarettes and shopping sprees since I feel like my hopes and ambitions are only illusions now, I can’t see the point anymore. So many times I’ve been told it’ll be beneficial to step outside my confort zone but mind you my « confort zone » was not so confortable, in fact it was pretty challenging but at least I loved what I was doing. I’ve never complained while on set, I’ve always worked my ass off to give the best of me even when I slept only a few hours, even if it lasted longer than expected, I put up with the late payments and last minute castings… but this I can’t. Every day at work is a reminder of my failure because I can’t keep up like my pairs and I’m not an intellectual like my mother wanted me to. My bf can’t comprehend why I’m pissed off when there are tobacco crumbs all over and used coffee cups piling up for days. And it makes me sad because I love him so much so does he, but the difficulties we are going through professionally are making our relationship suffer more than it should. I know it’s not that serious compared to other posts I’ve seen here but I really needed to get that off my chest.",4,1737341566.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

Hi. So update to all my followers. I had coffee with him today. And it was just amazing. I loved it. I’m very happy and while I know many people think I should leave him alone… I thought I was gonna get rejected. Like srsly. I was full on expecting him to tell me he doesn’t want to talk anymore. But then today happens. He tells me he likes hanging out with me. Says he meant it when he said he’s be there for me. And I love it. I really do. I just wish he saw me more than just a friend. Like. I know I’m not perfect and prolly not his type and I’ll full on believe he deserves better than me but dang. If I could just do anything more than just being friends with him I’d take it. But. I’m seeing someone else. Who isn’t even serious about me. Just keeps us exclusive and does things that makes me wonder if he likes me or not. I don’t get a hall pass on the guy I like unless the guy I like starts dating me. Which is fair. But tbf. The guy I like will never want that with me. He’s either too Christian to do that before marriage or just doesn’t find me that attractive.  I don’t know. But i do know if I ever got the chance to do that with him, id lose my mind and explode. 

Im very happy tonight. But im also kinda paranoid. What if he’s with another girl rn? I know I have no right to wonder that but I do. Cause I feel like he’d wanna be with any girl but me. Or at least I’d be the last option. And I know he’s not like that. But I just hate it. I hate the thought of him with another girl. But I can’t complain. I’m seeing another guy. I’ve debated ending things with the guy I’m seeing but I don’t know. We both get something out of it. And maybe one day he’ll love bomb me and I’ll fall for him again then forget the guy I like ever existed on top of becoming unhealthily skinny and live my life being a stay at home mom when I honestly want a job and would prefer a man who helps with the house chores. But no. I somehow end up with the misogynist. Not a bad life. But not ideal obv. 

I don’t know. I just wish he saw it in me. He’s such a great guy and I feel like any girl (or rellly anyone) would be lucky to have him as anything. The fact he hasn’t given up on me even tho I tried ghosting him a few times just baffles me and now I feel like I don’t think i could ever let him go. But I know I will have to soon when he leaves. Or when he gets a gf. Or literally anything. Hoping to god I will have been love bombed by the time he gets a gf. Or hey. Maybe I become his gf despite being a little —- you know what. 

I’m completely convinced he would not date me if he knew my history. Which I know id wrong to assume but it’s just a negative core belief. Obv he might not care in this day and age. But he’s just so old fashioned. And I love it abt him. But it makes me feel like I’d ruin a chance with him if I told him about my history. I’d ofc tell him to be honest. But I know I’d prolly lose him which would honestly crush me. 

lol. What am I even saying? He’s never gonna even ask me out. Or want me like that. I stand no chance at dating him. I’m sure there’s a line of girls waiting to date him who are much better. 

😤😤😤😤😤😤

I thought 2025 would be a hard year. But it’s turned out a lot better. I cannot express how happy I am rn. He just makes me so happy. But I don’t think I’d ever be able to tell him that or express how much happiness it gives either out of fear or just lack of being able to convey it. 

God. I know we aren’t end game. But I feel like he’d be worth a heart break if we did date. Cause he’s just really Amazing. I can’t wait to spend my bday night with him. Not like that. But like. Just being with him. Ughhhh this guy. He makes me genuinely too happy. I’m too happy rn for something that’s so insignificant. But it’s significant to me. I’m excited I get to get to know him more these next few months. I hope when he leaves it won’t be too hard. But knowing me I’m prolly gona fall harder for him when I get to know him. Which is fine I guess. I don’t care anymore cause I just want him around for as long as I can get. He just makes me so happy. I wish I could make him as happy as he makes me.

little backstory, my mom adopted me later at 35. Her and my dad decided to create and sustain a business now for 24 years. it hasnt been up until two years ago that theyve gotten a ton of work and have had to hire extra help. were mexican. so in our culture its  custom to take care of our parents when they age. which is something i have been bracing myself for since i can remember. both my parents grew up with 8+ sibilings. They are what you would consider the KARENS. theyre the judgmental ones who think theyre better and perfect than anyone else. literally the one difference theyve got against the rest of their family is that they chose the sober life. my moms dad drank for most of his life, and so did my dads. in mexico, you didnt have bills to pay so to say, so my grandpa would spend all his money on booze and very little to feed the kids. so my dad doesn't drink alcohol bcs he doesnt want to ever be like his dad( he has the occational glass of wine behind closed doors). my moms dad drank too much and cheated all the time etc. she decided to convert herself mormon at the age of eighteen. so they met and married. adopted me at her age of 36 and my dad was younger at 29. at the age of 16 , i got married, to my then bf bcs he had just turned 18 and i didnt want him to get charged with statutory r@pe. - you can comment below if you want that story separate. - when i was seventeen and a half, i decided i was done with him, and moved into a friends house and roomed there for a month or two before entangling myself with my next ex. We lasted four years. Oct. 2015 i decided to move to Seattle and start over. 

  
In Seattle, I start school. I was aspiring to become a diesel mechanic. I love cars and trucks. So i started school. Met a boy outside of school at my local bar. I was such a flirt always and made the first move. we kept in touch. we became an item by mid January and he wanted me to move in. In over my boots, i was ecstatic and couldn't wait. he promised me this and that. he seemed encouraging in my school/career choice. He wanted to see me all the time. i was so naive and dumb. arnt we all. anyways, i didn't realize he was a narcissist and a raging alcoholic until after i had moved in. i didnt know what i got myself into and by the time i was trying to leave, he was making it impossible and i was trapped. he lied to me about his living status and was living under his dads roof in a two br condo.  hes used threats against me and my family. things escalated from the honeymoon phase to the worse of mt worst in the matter of months. i drank id say the normal amount. maybe every other weekend before i met him. while with him, wed drink a lot. my tolerance went up and i could hold down my liqour. unlike him, i wasnt mad... and i wasnt an angry drunk. id always drink and have fun. then he showed me the bad side. I had no idea what an alcoholic looked like. what a normal drinker looked like. he would finish my room temp flat beers when he was done with his when i wasnt watching. first thing to go into the cart was beer/booze before groceries or diapers. etc. - i was pretty innocent to drugs at the time. He had apparently been taking pills and then admitted to M. hed mix those two and hell would break loose. if i didnt drink my half of the alcohol, he would and he would get worse. so i would drink it. lord forbid he saw me pour it down the drain, he would charge at me and go to try to hit me. so id drink it. it was a hit or miss of when he would get violent and start fighting. it was mental, physical and emotional abuse. he bent and shattered an aluminum mirrored sliding closet door on my face, (my eye brow still has its scar) and he ran from the scene after he called the cops supposedly on me.. so they took me, because he wasn't there. but none of what he did matters bcs i was also intoxicated. - (more to that story - and many many more like it) . hes broke all my phones, he broke my laptop for school, slashed my tires so i couldn't get away. eventually, it was to the point where i had no car left, no job and i got kicked out of the GST program bcs i missed so many days- thanks to him. he was the jealous type. he didnt want me going to college with a bunch of guys working on cars. i get that but still. possessiveness and jealousy is so wack and eew. so he would start fights.  so i quit school. stayed home. his dad was recently retired and since i was living there, it only seemed fair that i help him around the house while i wasnt working or in school. id serve him hand and foot his coffee, bf in bed, lunch and dinners. he had the most disgusting pets and wouldnt take them out to pee. hed use his copd as an excure to not let the dog out and just use pee pads instead. he wasnt incapable. inmobile. he just took twice as longer to do stuff bcs his breath intake was half a normal persons. it sucks but he still didnt have to make me his servant. right around this time that i lost my car and he thought he had control of me, i was about to leave. i was going to call my parents to the resuce to get me a flight back home. mind you - i hadn't gotten my period. i go get a test and sure shit, im positive. im doomed. i hang in there for a year and half. he promised me the stars and moon in changing his bad habits and of course they were all lies. I couldn't take it anymore, i up and left, moved back to my home state in the south. he ended up following us to my parents house. nothing changed here. things got worse. bcs he was now closet drinking since my parents dont drink and they didnt ""allow"" and hes an alcoholic, so he was going to get it no matter what. he had no respect in any aspects. it was horrible. i was embarrassed and ashamed. i wanted him gone. but i was always just so hopeful and forgiving. he destroyed my line of credit.  i gave too many chances, got taken advantage of etc. our room at my parents house was completly destroyed. also he never paid a dime towards rent the whole two years he was here. He always hid. never wanted to be around my parents. so there was always tension and i was always the middle man. my parents never accepted that i drank (note: and i still do, just back to my normal amount if not less - work and kids keep me sober) - it got to the point where he got so heavily involved with the drugs that he stopped working, my parents kicked him out. id sneak him in when it was -2 degrees outside. i felt bad. i ended up working full time in retail and was barley home. he was homeless. and id come home and let him in sometimes. bcs of our kids, id let him ""babysit the kids today"" - its not bcs he actually wanted to be there with my kids and family. he had no home. and was cold and homeless.  during these times he had been in and out of hospitals and rehabs. he edned up moving in with some girl he found from rehab in SC, and i was glad he was gone. hed call once in a while and thats it. he still tried to convince me to get back with him but he is so far gone. i was done with him before our first kid was born. anyways, his mom ended up passing away end of 2021, and he left back to seattle. I havent heard from him since. 

fast forwards to 2023 - im still working in retail. bcs we run the family business from home, my little ones dont let me work if they are there so i had to wait for them to be in school. Now they're both in school and i can finally work full time from home. but they have different schedules and no bus route  which means, i drop and pick them up. i just wish my mom would help me more. but shes lazy and now old. she hired an even older lady to help clean dishes and clean around the house bcs she doesnt want to do it. hires cleaning ladies to come once a week and mop sweep and clean the toilets. i can clean my toilets and mop and sweep my side of the house but she doesnt do her side. so she hires somsone. shes hired someone since i left at 16. shes used to someone doing it for her. as shed make me when i was younger. id be able to clean the whole house on a sunday if she paid me more, and if shed watch my kids while i cleaned , got work done, ran errands but she doesnt. she just lays in bed damn near 24/7. its quiet honestly sad. but its either she doesnt help and i do it all alone. or she helps and i have to hear her bitching and complain about the things that aren't to HER standards and likings.  Now this job ive got , i need to learn it to the t. and i cant because i dont just take my kids to school and pick them up. i got my mom who needs 500 things on top of the work list ive got to do. she send me links to extravagant meals and wants me to make.. and i make them. dry cleaning, and medicine prescription pickups . this means - grocery shopping, and errands. i make these meals and make a mess, and she goes and cleans her one dish-  all while she just sit in her bed on her laptop and calls me lazy bcs i cant get to the dished when she decided to step out of her cave. my kids need assistance, the business needs my attention, kids have extra curricular activites after school. She doesn't ofer to take them to school or classes. or to clean the dishes i used to make the meal SHE requested. bcs guess what i now have to clean that plus 100 more bcs my kids didnt like that dish and i had to make something else. growing up, shed sit on the couch when i came home from school and id be doing my thing , shed YELL for me , id run to her.. shed ask me to grab her the remote which was merely four feet away. its the fact that i am now doing the exact same thing i was for my ex's dad and i thought i wouldnt mind it bcs its my mom and i should want to do things for her. but her and i are so different. i just never connected with her or my dad the way all my other cousins or loved ones connect with their parents. circling back to alcohol. growing up, my parents would leave family parties when it barely got good - bcs alcohol . they didnt want me seeing the affects of alcohol. this new years, im thirty years old and my dad still treats me like im underaged and doesnt ever offer to have a toast of champagne with me or a celebratory glass of wine.  anytime we go out to any restaurant since i was a baby, he always says to the waitress ""no alcohol we dont drink"" - once in a blue moon, after i got a bit older hed order a glass here and there rarely. but even after turning 21 i never even dared to order any alcoholic beverage when out at dinner with them. they knew/know i drink. but they dont want to accept it. ever. Im nothing like my ex. but my parents have never seen a healthy ""tipsy"" me. bcs i moved out so young, and when i came back, id already experienced. and they saw what alcohol can do to one firsthand under their roof - my ex and how i was also a victim of reactive abuse.  so they obviously dont want that for me. but its the fact that im treated like a child. and will never be treated like an adult bcs i live under their roof. as long as im under their roof, they have control over me and the upper hand. i will never be an adult living here. i cant move out bcs that wouldn't be very daughterly of me, whos going to take care of them? also i cant give my kids a mediocre life after theyve lived here. so i will pick my battles and walk around eggshells and forever be a child living under their roof.  its like a circle im stuck in.. a broken record. there is no way of me gaining my parents trust and my consumption with alcohol. but its not even about that anymore- its the way im treated. and how they dont want to lose control over me and keep me ""a child"". its so mind boggling to me i cant comprehend it, why someone wants this much control over their adult child. i literally have no personal life. my life evolves around my parents my kids my parents home, my parents business. i just their puppet. not to mention, my kids dont even take me seriously! they are spoiled out the ass and absolutely no discipline. i cant discipline them bcs they just run to grandparents and they say yes. its their obsession with control over me and my future. and my mom wants me to be just like her and im the COMPLETE opposite of her. shes only ever had one boyfriend/lover/husband. ive experienced more. and not conservative at all. i have the potty mouth of a sailer and i have no idea where i got it from bcs both parents dont cuss obviously bcs theyre perfect. they like the modern white glossy looks, i like the mid century modern contemporary style looks. just so different. and i know theyre disappointed in me not finding myself a real man who had money and goals and ambitions. the thing is, i really believed my ex had goals and ambitions. he was so convincing always. he shattered a lot of trust between me and my parents and now im breaking my mental health trying to get back to pleasing them and proving to them that im not what they think that i am. and at this point i dont even know if its worth it .. their opinion about me. im so fed up. just accept that ill be forever 16 in their eyes.

This, of course, means I'm fairly cash-poor. For Christmas this year I told everyone in my family I just wanted gift cards. Not for necessities, because I'm fine there, but some gift cards so I can go out and treat myself with a coffee or bath bomb or whatever. Every year I usually get 2-3 gift cards anyway, but I made it clear to everyone who asked me for ideas that I really, truly, *only* wanted gift cards this time.

This is the first year I can think of, out of every Christmas I can remember, that not a single person gave me a gift card. I'm not terribly upset, because the gifts I did get were all lovely and thoughtful. If anything I find it really funny. But please, people- if someone in your life tells you they only want a gift card, believe them! I promise you we aren't just being polite. ",17,1737341432.0,Gifts,2,0.84,False

I haven’t forgiven myself for not knowing.,"I’m going to try to tell the story as briefly as I can. Around seven years ago I had a girlfriend in college. One night she slept over. I’m prone to anxiety and sometimes I do irrational things because of it. I decided to check her phone while she slept. On her phone I found that she had an app Coffee Meets Bagel downloaded. I checked in and she had conversations going with multiple guys. She gave her number out to one of them. I woke her up to confront her. She gave the excuse that she sent me a nude photo and I didn’t react how she wanted me to. Obviously huge fight happens. I’m gaslit and manipulated into staying and the relationship lasts another 8 months.

Here’s the deal. That incident still affects me to this day. I’ve forgiven my ex. I don’t know if she’s really a good person or not. But she had very obvious issues (as did I) and she wasn’t dealing with them in a healthy way at all. I’m not rooting for her or against her I don’t follow her anywhere, but I’m not angry at her anymore.

However, after all these years I haven’t been able to forgive myself. How she was able to message guys freely without me knowing and how I was so trusting for the longest time. It’s led me to have trust issues and this constant fear that people are betraying me. I basically made a promise to myself that I will never be caught looking that stupid again and it’s very negatively impacted my life and other relationships.

i’m 18 and this is definitely the nicest job i’ve ever had as far as pay and benefits go. but, i feel weird.

the environment is just so foreign and not everyone knew i was new that day, so a lot of people expected me to know how to do things i was unfamiliar with.

i was assigned some tasks by the chef assistant and stayed locked in with them, and was caught off guard when someone else asked me to do something that was called on the line.

i.e. i was frying chips, and they asked for tater tots, wasn’t sure if that was directed to me or not.

they said today wasn’t a good day for them (beginning at least, i helped prep a lot before opening) and they didn’t really have a training plan for me. this is the first job that’s had me work an 8 hour shift and i was more tired after i took my break, it was strange, not that i had a lot to do to break my flow to begin with.

everyone was still really nice though despite the stress and busyness of it all. i am super tired though, they had me on the slicer for probably 75%-80% of my shift. hadn’t stayed in the same spot standing like that since i had ACL surgery a few months ago so i was enduring. 

i’m also a lot messier than i realized, the same guy kept coming to clean up after me (it happened like twice but it was enough to leave an impact, i wish i did better because i knew better.)

1i5g9rw,https://i.redd.it/he02p62fb2ee1.jpeg,Podcast episode recap,"Rachel says they had a 1 month long winter break (a break from what, exactly?? Both you and your husbaby don’t have jobs!) but they just HAD TO add a few more days at the end to go skiing. 1 month just wasn’t enough 🙄

A ski holiday is super frustrating and hard, y’all! She had to get her kids dressed and she had to feed them 3 times a day + snacks. Then she had to take Bear back to the cabin for his naps in between ski sessions. It’s a lot of hard work! She also says has been skiing every year multiple times a year all her life since she turned 2 (REALLY?? What about the 10+ years you were living in Aruba?) 🤣

She is really enjoying the fact that her kids are now back at school/daycare and she has the rhythm of a steady day. A quiet home where she can sit by the fire and drink her ceremonial cacao adaptogen mushroom latte, light a candle and read a book or “do some work” whatever that means! 🤔

She brags about Lea coming out from her room at night and saying “Mama, I’m stinky, I’m thirsty and I’m hungry.” And Rakel realizing that she hadn’t taken a bath in 2 days. Does she not make sure her kids are clean and fed before sending them to bed at night? 😳 Yikes!

So Rachel is now doing her hardcore “functional medicine protocol” and she’s off coffee (which is ironic since her husband is a coffee roaster 🤣), off sugar and gluten (but we saw her stuffing her face with ONLY sugar & gluten during their ski trip! 🙄), and also low dairy. 

She claims that her and Dennis are doing Dry January, and have not had wine in 16 days. SURE JAN!! We all know that that is not true. just in the last few days, she has posted stories of herself drinking alcohol twice already so of course you’re not feeling a difference in cutting alcohol because you’re still drinking it!! 🤦🏻‍♀️ She says they don’t usually drink huge amounts, only a glass with dinner here and there. REALLYYYY? 🤔 How stupid do you think we are Rachel? 

On the day she recorded this episode she said she woke up at 4 AM and had an “early breakfast” at 7:30. She realizes that for most people 7:30 is a normal breakfast time but she usually has breakfast at 9am. That’s because unlike the rest of us she doesn’t have to be at work by 9am. Imagine thinking 7:30 is an early breakfast time! 🫠

Also, her chicken’s eggs are the most amazing incredible best eggs in the whole world! REALLY RAKEL? Didn’t she just say recently she had the best egg EVER while on their ski trip? 😆🤦🏻‍♀️

She says that before she started this protocol, she would constantly be hungry after every meal. She would need a snack every few hours and had crazy sweet cravings all the time - and that while she was vegan it was even worse - she was constantly thinking about her next meal. She was terrified and not being able to find food, so her purse would be packed with snacks and she would be obsessing about food all day long. And now she realizes that this was because she was “malnourished” for a long time. but now she no longer thinks about food - no, she just rambles on for 30 minutes on her podcast all about her insanely extreme new diet where she consumed 140g of protein a day and counts her macros. How does she not realize that she’s still obsessing about food all day long, just in a different way? 🤦🏻‍♀️

She admits that her vegan days were just about caloric restriction that kept her really slim, but she got a gold star for being a good person and for doing what’s best for the animals and the planet. SO IS THIS YOU ADMITTING THAT YOU WERE NEVER TRULY VEGAN?? THAT YOUR GOAL WAS JUST TO KEEP YOUR BODY SLIM?? 😳 Shocker!!! We all knew this but for her to actually say these words is WILD!!

1i5g62y,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1i5g62y/ever_had_a_job_so_bad_it_made_you_rethink_your/,Ever had a job so bad it made you rethink your entire existence?,"Last spring, I learned what hell feels like—it’s waking up at 6:00 a.m., suiting up in gloves and a respirator, and ripping apart mattresses in a dimly lit warehouse while an angry boss watches you on CCTV. I’d procrastinated finding a summer job and ended up scrambling at the last minute. Desperation landed me at a mattress recycling warehouse. It sounded manageable in theory, but in practice? I lasted exactly one week.

By 11 a.m. on my first day, I thought I was going to collapse. The ""quota"" felt designed by someone who thought we were robots. My back was screaming from hoisting mattresses, and the only sunlight I saw was during the rare moments I volunteered to haul mattresses outside. The people? Well, let’s just say the vibe was more “grumpy dictatorship” than “teamwork makes the dream work.”

When I quit, I felt like a failure. I kept thinking, “What’s wrong with me? Other people survive hard jobs. Why couldn’t I?” That spiral of self-doubt stuck with me for months until I started therapy. Spoiler: therapy didn’t magically fix my life, but it did give me the tools to climb out of that pit. Here’s what I learned:

1. **Your environment rewires your brain.** Working in a stressful, negative environment can mess with your cortisol levels, making you feel like you’re in constant survival mode. This isn’t “laziness”; it’s your nervous system trying to protect you.
2. **Shame is the worst motivator.** Whether it’s a yelling boss or your inner critic, shame shuts down your creativity and problem-solving abilities. It’s like trying to run with a weight strapped to your ankles.
3. **Not all discomfort is growth.** There’s a difference between pushing yourself and being in a toxic situation. Know when to walk away—it’s not quitting; it’s self-respect.

The kicker? I didn’t just want to recover; I wanted to understand why I’d let myself stay in that situation, even for a week. Books became my lifeline, and these five blew my mind:

* **""**[Can’t Hurt Me](https://davidgoggins.com/book/)**"" by David Goggins**This memoir is like a punch in the face (in the best way). Goggins, a Navy SEAL who overcame trauma and obesity, teaches mental toughness like no other. His “cookie jar” method—revisiting past wins to fuel your current battles—totally changed how I see resilience.
* **""**[The Power of Now](https://www.shortform.com/summary/the-power-of-now-vb13747-b-summary-eckhart-tolle?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA4rK8BhD7ARIsAFe5LXJPCA5ACUH9AoCCr8EUv-xlE2UIabj9z29E9yXM-cLC1wAdN1RxbVwaArEcEALw_wcB)**"" by Eckhart Tolle**Tolle’s spiritual guide taught me to stop fixating on past failures (hi, mattress job) or future anxieties. It’s about grounding yourself in the present moment and finding peace amid chaos. This book was my go-to whenever I felt overwhelmed.
* **""**[Deep Work](https://calnewport.com/deep-work-rules-for-focused-success-in-a-distracted-world/)**"" by Cal Newport**Newport argues that focused, meaningful work is the antidote to burnout and mediocrity. I started scheduling “deep work” blocks, even for job applications, and my productivity shot up.
* **""**[Mindset](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-mindset-2795025)**"" by Carol Dweck**If you’ve ever felt like a failure, this book will slap some sense into you. Dweck explains the difference between a fixed and growth mindset, showing how failures are just stepping stones when you approach them right.
* **""**[The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck](https://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck)**"" by Mark Manson**Manson’s no-BS approach helped me stop caring about things that didn’t matter (like impressing a boss who clearly didn’t care about me). Life’s too short to give unlimited f\*cks.

Here’s what really stuck with me: Sometimes the worst experiences can be your biggest teachers. That mattress job? It sucked, but it also showed me how to set boundaries, listen to my gut, and value my mental health over a paycheck.

If you’re in a job that’s crushing your soul—or any situation that’s draining you—know this: It’s okay to leave. It’s okay to prioritize yourself. And it’s definitely okay to fail, as long as you’re learning from it.

Also, PSA: Read more. Even if it’s just summaries. You’d be amazed at how much you can absorb in 10 minutes before bed or while waiting for your coffee. Self-growth doesn’t need to be a grand gesture—it’s in the little steps you take daily.

Now, tell me: What’s the worst job you’ve ever had, and what did it teach you? Let’s share some stories, because honestly, we’ve all been there.

edit pt 2: thank yall for the input im going to disclose before i meet someone. my intentions are never to trick someone!

hi i'm a trans woman visting thailand. i pass as a woman for the most part & have had sexual reassignment surgery. In america society often justifies violence towards trans women who don't disclose their transgender status to partners. While I understand the importance of telling a romantic interest you are trans I only find it necessary to disclose if one was to do anything physical. 

Because of the political climate in america I typically tell people right off the bat. If I were to meet a thai man off an app like tinder for coffee for example without sharing my transness will that put me in danger? Again I would disclose if It were to lead to anything more than a friendly cofee meet up.

I know that gender diversity is a little more common here but I also see from my research that trans woman in thailand face discrimination & violence so I just want to be safe & respectful of the locals here.

What I'm about to tell you may seem wild and imaginative and to some maybe unbelievable. But what I'm about to tell you it's completely true. Thinking back on it, I kind of wish it was something I imagined in my head. But it wasn't, and to this day it still sticks with me as a defining moment in my life. Along with the rest of the strange events that happened, after I first encountered The Stranger from the Car.

Fast forward 5 years from the first encounter with this stranger, this intruder who stalked me over a weekend alone while my parents were away. I was Now 20 at the time and attending college, residing in a dorm on campus. Thanksgiving was just a few days away and mostly everyone I knew including my roommate were leaving campus.

My Parents decided to take a cruise for the week of Thanksgiving, and the thought of seeing my Grandparents who I believe still despise me for the holiday sounded dreadful. So I decided I'd Stay on campus and eat thanksgiving dinner in the cafeteria. Only I expected others to stay and do the stay at least, But much to my surprise It was only Me and Our Campus Security, Officer Jenkins who would remain on campus for the week along with a few of the Kitchen staff to make a small thanksgiving meal for Anyone who Stayed behind.

Thanksgiving break began rather uneventfully. I was used to the hustle and bustle of college life, but now, with most of the students off campus and the grounds practically empty, it felt as if the world had shrunk to just me and the looming shadows stretching across the buildings. I was beginning to feel bored and lonely, and I couldn't call my parents who were in the middle of international waters at this point.

Officer Jenkins, the older security guard with a gruff exterior and an almost paternal sense of vigilance, I was the only person on campus. We'd exchanged small talk in the cafeteria as we ate our solitary Thanksgiving meal, but even his presence couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. The same feeling I'd had that weekend 5 years ago when my parents went away for my dads work trip.

It all started on the second night of break, around 12pm. I walked back towards my dorm from the library, for some reason, campus super dark as all of the security lights are timed to turn off at midnight. I had been in so late to finish my paper that now, for the first time, I realized how dark and isolated it all was. A light breeze whipped up fallen leaves, carrying with it an air crisp with oncoming winter. As I passed the parking lot near the edge of campus, I saw a car that looked like it was out of place. It was parked toward the far end, running, but with its headlights off.

At first, I didn't think much of it. There were plenty of empty cars this time of year, but it wasn't common for someone to park and leave their car running. But then, as I continued walking, something made me glance back. Just as I glanced back I noticed a figure sat in the driver's seat, just behind the wheel, motionless, as if they were waiting. My breath caught in my throat.

I began to walk more quickly, telling myself it was nothing, I was just paranoid. But as I reached the stairwell to the dorm, the feeling of eyes on me was unmistakable. I turned my head sharply, catching a glimpse of something behind me. It was the car that had been there but now without a person behind in the drivers seat. Nothing moved, there was only an empty car, yet a presence I could feel. That crawling sensation of something gave rise to the hair on the back of my neck.

I got settled into my Dorm and called the main office and got ahold of Officer Jenkins, but after he patrolled the campus he called me back to let me know much to my surprise that the car I had saw was no longer there.

By the fourth night, I'd had enough. My mind kept drifting back to that first incident with the man in the car, how his face was indistinguishable in the dark, how the impression of his gaze was always on me though I could never catch a proper glimpse of him.

I went to see Officer Jenkins, whose office was tucked behind the main office desk in the campus building, always kept in dim lighting with old coffee cups and papers strewn about. He sat behind the desk, thick glasses perched low on his nose as he flipped through a binder of incident reports.

Hey, Officer Jenkins,"" I started, looking around in a somewhat paranoid fashion as if someone might be listening. ""There's something weird going on. I keep seeing this car parked at the same spot at night, and… I don't know. It's been creeping me out. I know you said It was gone by the time you checked but I still have the feeling of being watched at night.

Jenkins didn't look up from his binder. ""It's just you and me on campus, kid. Everyone else's gone. Could be a late night driver or someone visiting the place. There's nothing to worry about.""

His words were supposed to reassure me, but they didn't. I wasn't sure if he was trying to ease my fears or just brushing it off, but I knew what I had seen.

That night, the air was heavier, more smothering. I walked in the dark back from the cafeteria to my dorm, my heart pounding with every step. When I reached the parking lot, the car was again there, waiting for me it seemed, like it had expected me. Its headlights beaming, casting eerie shadows across the empty lot.

I took a deep breath and told myself that this was it, that this was something that I had to face. This wasn't paranoia, I knew instinctively that there was something not quite right here. I drew closer to the car, my mind racing through all the options. The closer I came, the heavier my sense of foreboding felt.

Then I saw it.

The figure in the car was seated in the driver's seat, his face obscured by the darkness. It was that same feeling from before. That cold, unnerving presence.

I felt frozen, my body unable to react. It wasn't until I heard the faint sound of footsteps behind me that I snapped out of it. I whipped around, panic surging through me as I saw Officer Jenkins walking toward me, his flashlight cutting through the darkness.

""You alright, kid?"" he asked, his voice calm but laced with a hint of concern.

I opened my mouth to say something but nothing came out. I was too scared to say what I had known all along. The terrifying truth, that the stranger wasn't lurking in the shadows. They were following me, watching me. And worse, they had been on campus this whole time.

Officer Jenkins stepped forward and laid the beam of his flashlight on the car. The figure was gone. The headlights were off, and the car was silent now, like it had never been there at all.

He sighed. ""You've been seeing things, I think. It's just us here, and that's the way it's gonna be for the rest of the week. Now, go on and get some sleep. You're overthinking this.""

But I knew, deep down, that Officer Jenkins didn't believe me. He didn't see the same things I had. The figure, the car it was all real. And the stranger wasn't gone.

I went back to my dorm that night, but I couldn't shake this feeling that someone was out there, waiting for me. With Officer Jenkins on campus, it no longer felt safe. It wasn't the isolation but the creeping feeling that somewhere in the dark corners of campus, the stranger from the car was still watching. And this time, I didn't think I'd be able to escape them.

It was the last night of Thanksgiving break, and at around 1:30am, I was awakened by the a familiar yet blood-curdling sound. Beep-beep! I had heard it before years ago, only this time it was different and more insistent, almost frantic. I sat up in bed, my heart racing. I ran to my dorm window and looked out.

There it was again, the same car parked in the parking lot, its headlights cutting through the darkness. But this time, the horn was blowing, like he was really laying on it. I felt confused and a little scared as I quickly reached for my phone and dialed the front desk to try to get Officer Jenkins on the line. But as I waited, the line was silent, dead. My pulse quickened. That couldn't be right. The phones had worked fine just hours before.

I frustratedly threw the phone down and then bolted from my room toward the main office, in hopes Jenkins could assist me. The silence of the halls seemed to elevate every step that I took as being very loud and conspicuous. As I neared the large entryway glass doors, my eyes caught something.

A figure stood in the shadowed hallway outside the dorm through the glass, his eyes fixed on mine. It was him, the man from the car. He didn't move, just stared. It was as if his presence froze time. I stepped backward, my breath catching in my throat, but he didn't stop. He slowly reached for the door handle.

The panic swelled in. I swung around and ran, my feet pounding against the cold tile floor. I couldn't think straight. My mind was racing with the thought of something terrible about to happen. As I ran down the empty Hallways I could Hear his footsteps closely behind me. I burst into my room, clicked the door shut behind me, and dropped onto the floor to try to steady my breathing.

The handle shook. My heart stopped. It was him. Rattle-Rattle. Bang-Bang! This went on for a solid 4 minutes and then silence. I held my breath and listened. Seconds passed, then minutes. The door didn't open, Was he still out there, or had he moved on? I didn't hear a sound, so I sat up and walked slowly towards the door of my dorm. I pressed my ear against the door to listen in hopes of hearing if he was still there. Thats when I heard it, the same voice that mutters Hmm as I was pressed behind that Christmas tree box in the closet all those years ago. Only this time it muttered ever so softly; I will Always find you.

Just then for a split second, my heart skipped a beat and I froze in complete fear. I fell to the floor, hands pressed behind me to keep myself up. All I could do was stare at the door, not knowing what had just happened. Minutes passed as just sat in complete silence staring at the door, when once again I was startled by a stern knock. Knock-Knock-Knock! ""You okay in there kid?"" Officer Jenkins shouted out.

I sat up quickly and opened my dorm door. I'd never been so happy to see Officer Jenkins before in my life, yet there I was so relieved to see him! I ran into his arms and shouted, I've never been so glad to see you! He was he here, he was trying to get in my dorm!

Much to my surprise Jenkins witnessed him running out of the hallway door and getting into his car, quickly peeling out of the parking lot in panic as he shined his flashlight in his direction. ""He's gone kiddo, and the authorities are on the way"" he said sternly!

The Morning slowly rolled in, and after a brief time of filing Was he indeed the same person who had broken into my house all those years ago? Why Me? Unfortunately, this would not be my last encounter with the stranger from the car...

But I wasn't going to Phoenix.  So I checked my account, wondering if someone had hacked me or something, and there was nothing in my account.  This message existed in my app, but there was nothing else about this flight (and there was no record locator with the message).  I checked the flight number, and it goes from PAE (Everett WA) to PHX.  I've never been to that airport.  I chatted support, and they said they couldn't find anything in my account regarding this flight, though it must be a be a glitch.  I asked if I could talk to tech support, they said they don't have tech support, but would submit my request to IT.  I thanked them and moved on.

But then, on the 16th, I got this:

I uninstalled and reinstalled the app between the 12th and 16th.  It remains only in the app, and it doesn't matter if I log in or not - the app itself seems to be linked to this reservation.  I'm hoping it's just this reservation that's mixed up, and not someone else's whole account!

hi i'm a trans woman visting thailand. i pass as a woman for the most part & have had sexual reassignment surgery. In america society often justifies violence towards trans women who don't disclose their transgender status to partners. While I understand the importance of telling a romantic interest you are trans I only find it necessary to disclose if one was to do anything physical. 

Because of the political climate in america I typically tell people right off the bat. If I were to meet a thai man off an app like tinder for coffee for example without sharing my transness will that put me in danger? Again I would disclose if It were to lead to anything more than a friendly cofee meet up.

I know that gender diversity is a little more common here but I also see from my research that trans woman in thailand face discrimination & violence so I just want to be safe & respectful of the locals here.

1i5fzn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i5fzn7/the_haunted_crib/,The Haunted Crib ,"*Go out at night and you will see*

*The face on the moon staring down at thee*

*If he smiles, sweet dreams come true*

*If he frowns, he'll come for you*

*- Old German folk song*



""That's such a creepy song,"" Ann said, shaking her head. ""Your parents would sing it to you every night?""

I shrugged. ""It wasn't the *only* song they sang to me as a kid,"" I said, feeling the need to defend my folks. ""But it was a family tradition going back generations. Like, ‘before my ancestors came to the US’ old.""

""I've never heard of it before.""

""Outside of my family, I really haven't either. I understand why.""

""Obviously.""

""But the last part never bothered me.""

""Never saw the face in the moon frown?""

""Never saw the face on the moon,"" I said.

""You aren't thinking of singing that to our kid, are you?"" Ann rubbed her very pregnant belly out of habit.

I didn't respond right away. She knew what I was thinking and started shaking her head no before the words leapt from my lips. ""I mean, it's tradition, after all.""

""No way,"" she said. ""I don't want to give our kid a complex.""

""It won't. I heard it all the time, and I'm okay."" Ann smirked, and I rolled my eyes, anticipating the joke. I cut it off at the pass. ""You married me. In fact, you couldn't wait to get in on these family traditions.""

She burst out laughing, and it made me smile. Her laugh, a huge blurt followed by nearly soundless cackles, made my heart sing. Even more so when I saw her swollen belly bob up and down with joy.

""Can I think about it, at least?"" she asked. ""I want to ask around to see if anyone else has ever heard this lullaby.""

I said sure. We changed the subject and went back to assembling the crib. Our son Mac was due in a few weeks, and we'd fallen behind in prepping his room. It wasn't totally our fault.

Needing to stretch our money, we bought a crib secondhand from someone who lived across the country. Ann found it during her late-night web crawling through Facebook groups. There were options locally, but they all looked like cheap deathtraps. I'm sure they were fine, but when Ann laid eyes on this one, it was love at first sight. She had to have it.

It was an antique but very well maintained. The seller said it had been a family heirloom they inherited when their parents died. Since the seller had no kids nor plans to have any, they put it up for sale. Oddly, they couldn't move the piece, and the price kept dropping. When it fell into Ann's target range, she sprung. Even with a higher shipping cost, it was cheaper than something new from Amazon.

The crib arrived in four boxes. The seller, who left no return address, had carefully pried apart the pieces and shipped them in separate containers. As expected, there were issues with the shipping, and we got the pieces at different times. The last box arrived yesterday, so we were reassembling it. Carefully.

""I can't believe they took this thing apart,"" I said. ""This is old-world craftsmanship.""

""I know,"" Ann said, beaming. ""It's stunning, isn't it?""

It really was. The old-world artisan had made the crib from mahogany wood, so it was as sturdy as can be. The color was a rich brown with the faintest highlights of red. But, the carvings on the head and footboards took this from a delightful piece of furniture to a room centerpiece.

In the center of the headboard was a carving of a smiling sun, their eyes cast down into the crib. The carved radiating rays went all the way to the edges of the board. Along the top, the artist carved what looked like cats, all following a crawling toddler.

The footboard was just as intricately designed. In the middle was the moon. Another face looking down at the crib with a Mona Lisa smile. The craftsman had carved the different phases in an arc, radiating from each side of the central moon. If you started from the left and followed along, the face would gradually appear as more of the moon came into view. A full, smiling face greeted you at its height before phasing back to nothing on the right.

Carved figures depicting medieval townspeople who lived and worked in a small town adorned the top. We made out most of them - butchers, bakers, blacksmiths, farmers - but a few were a mystery to us. Especially the man in the middle. It looked like a musician, but he was playing an instrument I'd never seen before. It kind of looked like a cow's horn, but I wasn't positive.

It was seeing this smiling moon face that had dislodged the lullaby from my memory.

""When Mac moves out of this, how much do you think we can sell this for?"" I asked, carefully assembling the legs to the base.

""We're not selling this,"" Ann said instantly. ""This is now our heirloom to pass down.""

""Until our kid sells it on their preferred social media marketplace sometime in the future. It'll probably be called HappyTime or Frndshp or something.""

""If we raise little Mac right, he'll hold on to it forever,"" she said, rubbing her belly again. ""I can already tell he's a good boy.""

We finished putting the crib together, and I moved it into place. We took a step back to admire it. Ann was right (as usual). This was a stunning piece of furniture. She leaned her head against my shoulder. ""We're actually doing this, huh? Becoming parents.""

""Crazy,"" I said, slinging my arm around her waist. ""I'm going to be someone's dad. Jesus.""

She laughed. ""You're going to be a great dad.""

""Only if I sing my family's traditional song to them.""

She laughed. ""Not a chance. Can I get you to rub my feet? They're killing me.""

A few hours later, we headed to bed. Bedtime had gotten earlier and earlier as the pregnancy advanced. I assumed it was the body's biological clock getting us ready for late-night feedings and butt changes.

Outside our window, I spied the full moon in all its glory. It was one of those freakishly large full moons that look amazing in person, but when you snap a picture, it just never captures the astonishing view. I called Ann over to take a peek.

She waddled over to the window and glanced up. ""Damn, the moon looks huge. Like, 'size of my belly' big.""

I reached out and rubbed her protruding stomach. ""I wouldn't go that far.""

""Oh my god,"" she said, pointing up. ""I…."" She started laughing at first, but soon tears began falling.

""What? Are you okay? Is something wrong with the baby?""

""I…I think I see a face on the moon.""

""What?""

She pointed up again. ""Off to the side. The darker spots look like a face. See it?""

""No.""

""It's…smiling.""

I rolled my eyes. ""Are you fucking with me?""

""No, I swear,"" she said. ""Do you honestly not see it?""

""I don't,"" I confessed. ""It just looks like the moon.""

""Hold on a second."" She grabbed her phone, zoomed in, and snapped a photo. She showed me and pointed at what she said was a smiling face. ""See it?""

""Kinda, but not really.""

""Wow. Do you see any face at all?""

I looked back up at the full moon. ""Nope,"" I said, scanning the surface for anything that might trick my mind and finding nothing.

""What do I get again if I see a smiling face? Sweet treats? I could use a snack.""

""Dreams. Sweet dreams,"" I corrected. ""Does this mean that we can sing the song to Mac now?""

""Not if there's a chance he'll see a frowning moon. The world is already fracturing. We don't need to add on some lunar curses for good measure,"" Ann said. ""You coming to bed?""

""Go ahead,"" I said, still staring up at the moon, ""I think I caught a second wind. I'm gonna stay up for a bit.""

""Don't be up too late. Remember, we have that appointment tomorrow.""

I kissed her forehead and sent her back to bed. Within minutes, Ann was asleep. She's like a robot in that way - she just powers down. The pregnancy has made it easier for her to slip away to the land of nod.

I was tired, but I was also curious. Ann seeing a face on the moon really hit me. I wasn't jealous (well, maybe a little), but I suddenly had a desire to look up the lullaby's origins. I hopped on my computer and started searching but came up empty. There wasn't a single thing out there about the song.

I glanced at the clock and saw it was just after ten. My dad, a notorious night owl, was probably still up. I decided to give him a call and see if he knew anything. He picked up on the second ring.

""Everything okay with my grandkid?""

""Yes, yes,"" I said. ""Mac and Ann are fine.""

""Thank God,"" he said, chuckling. ""I can't begin to tell you how nervous I am on your behalf. I'm so worried something bad is going to happen. Never had this when your mom was pregnant with you.""

""Maybe I wasn't as important to you as your first grandbaby,"" I joked.

He laughed. ""Yeah, that must be it. What's going on? Why the late-night call?""

""I have a random question for you. You remember the nursery rhyme you guys used to sing to me when I was a kid?""

""I sang a lot of songs.""

""The one about the moon smiling and frowning. The old German one?""

""Oh yeah,"" he said. ""That one was an odd. I hadn't thought about it for years, but it popped back into my head when you were born. It's probably because my folks sang it to me all the time as a kid. It was strange. Maybe that part of your brain gets activated when you finally have a little one?""

""What do you know about it?""

""Not much, admittedly. My parents sang it to me, and theirs sang it to them. It was some old family tradition. Kind of like Hank the Elf, ya know?""

Hank the Elf was Santa's magical helper, who would leave me chocolates in a sock I hung off my dresser every night in December. Sometimes, we'd exchange notes. Even after I knew Hank was my dad, I'd still write notes to Hank, and, like clockwork, he'd write back. I couldn't wait to do that with Mac.

""It's weird. I can't find anything about it online. Like, nothing. No lyrics. No history. No recorded melody. It just doesn't exist anywhere outside of our family.""

""That is odd. My parents always told me it was an old folk song, and I had no reason to doubt it. There's seriously nothing?""

""Look yourself,"" I said.

I heard him typing away on his computer. A few seconds later, he sighed. ""Well, ain't that something?""

""Did our ancient ancestors make up the song and never spread it around?""

""I dunno,"" he said. ""Maybe you can check in with a professor of mythology or music or Middle Age history? They might shed some light on it.""

""Maybe it was part of a ritual or something,"" I said, half jokingly. ""Maybe the elders were witches or something?""

He laughed. ""If they were, and I never got the ability to cast spells, I'm going to be so upset.""

We bullshitted a little before I told him about the new crib. I switched over to Facetime and went into Mac's room. I showed him the crib, and he was impressed. He adored the little carvings but worried they might be a choking hazard if Mac broke them off.

""I hadn't thought of that,"" I said.

""You will. As soon as the boy arrives, your 'dad brain' kicks in, and all you'll be able to think about is all the ways everyday items inside your house might spell death for your kids. It's exhausting.""

""We've already started babyproofing cabinets,"" I said. ""I hate the locks so much.""

He laughed. ""I thought you were going to do a dinosaur theme in his room. When did you switch to a storybook theme?""

""We didn't switch.""

""Then why get a bed with figures from the pied piper on it?""

""What?""

""The guy in the middle is playing a flute.""

""That doesn't make him the pied piper.""

""But then why is the other side a bunch of rats being led by a toddler?""

""Those are cats,"" I said.

""Son, you may want to look at them again.""

I walked over to the crib and inspected the carved animals closely. From afar, I swore they were cats, but up close, there was no denying I was wrong. They were rats. ""Son-of-a-bitch. You're right. They are rats.""

""The teeth weren't a giveaway?"" he asked.

""I hadn't even paid attention, to be honest. I doubt Ann did because when she mentioned it to me a few weeks ago, she said something about cats.""

""'Parent brain' comes for us all. Consider this the first of many times you'll be too tired or emotionally drained to think straight. Welcome to the club.""

We chatted a bit more before saying our goodbyes and hanging up. I'd been half-paying attention to what my dad was saying for a couple of reasons. For one, he was going long on an article he read once, years ago, that talked about the story of the actual pied piper. In my dad's typical storytelling fashion, he included every fact or half-remembered fact that ended up muddying the narrative. Apparently, a bunch of kids in 1200s Germany died or went missing or something. Some people said the piper was a metaphor for death, some said he was real, and others said he was a witch. I dunno. Dad was all over the place.

For two, I couldn't shake the image of the pied piper being carved into a crib. Why in the world would anyone ever make a bed with that as the theme? The guy ends up drowning all those kids. Who would want a nightly reminder of that?

A thought streaked across my brain. What would Ann think when I told her about this in the morning? How crushed would she be? She loved this crib.

I turned to leave the room when I heard a car turn down our street, blasting a bass-heavy song. It was so loud it rattled our indoor fixtures. I opened up the blinds, flooding the room with moonlight, and glared out. I spied a lifted truck with blue running lights slowly driving down our street. They seemed determined to wake up the whole goddamn neighborhood.

Then I chuckled to myself. ""Jesus, I'm becoming an old man already. This kid has aged me.""

I went to pull the blinds back down when I glanced up at the full moon. That's when I saw it. My jaw went slack, and I could hear blood whooshing in my ears. Tears welled up and burst, rolling down my frozen face. I hadn't wanted to believe Ann earlier because it sounded so impossible. And yet, here it was, looking down at me.

A face on the moon…and he was frowning.

""Oh fu…"" I said before I heard something snap behind me. I turned and looked but saw nothing out of place. At first. In the yellow moonlight, I saw what had snapped. A single figure had been ripped from the crib. The pied piper.

I flipped on the light but couldn't see where the figure had fallen. I didn't know how it had snapped off. The figure must have cracked during shipping and finally broken off the railing. That seemed farfetched, though. I'd seen the piper figure firmly attached earlier. But what else could it be? Nothing running through my brain made sense. It was just me in here, and it's not like it broke itself off the crib. It was just a piece of wood.

I ran over to the crib and flung off the mattress. The figure had disappeared. I was about to move the crib aside to check behind the dresser next to it when I froze. The moon's smiling face on the footboard had changed to a frown. The sun on the headboard was gone altogether.

I let go of the railing like it was electrified and stumbled back. In the corner of my mind, I heard the faintest notes from a flute play. My eyes caught the shadow of a man dart behind me. That was my cue to get the hell out.

I bolted out, slamming the door behind me. I turned to make sure nothing had followed me out of the room. There was nothing. I waited a second or two just to make sure.

""What are you doing?"" It was Ann. The shock of hearing her voice made me scream. ""You feeling okay?""

""I...I saw a face. On, on the moon.""

She looked crushed. She walked over to me and stroked my arm. ""You saw a frown, didn't you?""

""I, I did.""

""Well, you know what that means, right?"" she asked, staring deeply into my eyes. ""It means you're going to die.""

That shocked me. ""Wh-why would you say that?""

""Because I'm going to be the one who kills you.""

I yanked my arm away from her touch. I tried to respond, but my voice died in my throat. My wife - my beautiful, lovely, sweet wife - had just threatened to kill me in her normal honeyed voice. It was as matter-of-fact as if she asked me to switch the laundry over. We locked eyes, and she smiled wide. Too wide.

The skin at the corners of her mouth cracked and slowly but violently pulled apart. The skin tore in strips, and blood spurted from the wounds. She didn't react at all. Instead, she crammed her hands into the sides of her mouth. She squeezed down on the shredded flaps, her fingers as tight as a vise, and yanked her arms away from her body.

Her face tore and ripped away from her skull. Each hand held a jagged edge of bloody flesh. It wobbled in her grip, the nerves firing off their last bit of stored energy. The muscles under her skin twitched and pulsated. Blood oozed from them.

She dropped the skin, and it plopped to the ground with a wet slap. Her hands went back to her face. Putting both hands back in her mouth, she started pulling up. Hard. She let out a strained grunt that gave way to the bones in her face and skull cracking. Some shards burst through the muscle as the top of her head lifted off her body. With a final bit of effort, she pulled the top of her head clean off.

Underneath was the featureless face of the pied piper figure.

Without thinking, I threw a punch. It landed with a crunch, but it wasn't the wood that crumbled. It was my poor fist. The pied piper raised my wife's hand and shamed me, shaking her finger back and forth. The piper reached into the gap at her neck and yanked hard, splitting her body in two.

The halves of my wife's body fell like a butcher had sliced them. Standing in front of me now was the now human-sized wooden pied piper. It had freed itself from the crib and come looking for me. Now that it had me, it raised the horn to its face. Music started playing inside my head.

For a fleeting second, I felt my body calm. My mind, which had been racing like a lost Andretti relative, instantly soothed. The edges of my vision softened, and from the piles of gore in front of me, I saw dozens of plants rising. My house gave way to a verdant meadow with soft, rolling hills in the distance. The sky above was so blue I had to shield my eyes from the color. Fluffy, balloon-like clouds scudded across.

The firework explosion of blooming flowers drew my eyes away from the sky. They were the most exquisite colors I'd ever seen. Unnaturally vibrant. Not long after, fat black and yellow bumble bees zig-zagged in a blossom to drink up the alluring nectar.

It felt like I had stepped into a painting - everything was so real, but it had a sheen of artificiality. As much as the music rendered this serene image in front of me and urged me to let go, a dark corner of my brain was screaming for me to wake up from the illusion. My monkey brain knew something was wrong.

""What's all the racket?"" It was Ann. The real Ann. She emerged from our bedroom, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. The return of her voice - her real voice - helped light up the darkened part of my brain. The art project melted away, and the gore returned. I saw Ann's horrified face and heard my scared subconscious screaming again.

""Run!"" I yelled.

I pushed past the pied piper, grabbed Ann's hand, and yanked her along toward the front door. She stumbled, and only through an act of god and many intense arm workouts did I keep her upright. If we fell, I knew we'd be goners. I grabbed my keys, whipped open the door, and we took off for the car.

""Get in! GET IN!"" I yelled, fumbling with the keys to the car.

""What's happening?""

""I saw a face on the moon. It was frowning.""

She didn't say a word. She didn't have to - her facial reaction said everything. We both slid into the car. I fired up the engine and glanced over my shoulder to make sure I wasn't about to take out some poor sap walking his dog late at night. When I turned it back to the house, I saw the pied piper standing in the doorway.

He wasn't alone.

All of those wooden rats had ripped themselves off the crib and had come to life. Only, they weren't the size of regular rats. Not even the size of burly New York subway rats. These things were as big as Rottweilers. Like the piper, they had no features…save for razor-sharp teeth.

""What the hell are those?""

""Rats.""

""From where?""

""The crib,"" I said.

""Our crib?""

""After tonight, it's the dump's crib. Buckle up!""

The piper played music, but I couldn't hear it this time. But the rats could. They turned their attention toward my car. The lead rat hunched down and launched themselves onto my hood. It misjudged the slickness of my car and fell off, but by that time, the second rat was airborne.

I jammed the car into gear and slammed on the gas pedal. My car rocketed backward into the street. The rats kept coming. A third and a fourth leapt through the air and landed on my trunk. They started biting the metal, and, much to my amazement, the metal started crunching.

""What do we do? Can we stop this?""

An idea popped into my brain. I threw my phone at Ann. ""Call my dad. I have to ask him about the song.""

She dialed his number. I heard a pop from my back driver's side tire as she did. The air came screaming out. It sounded like someone in distress. The passenger side rear went too, and the back of my car dropped.

I shifted into drive and pressed on the gas. My car lurched forward, but something caught in the tires and kept us from escaping. A rat had wedged itself in the wheel well. We couldn't move forward. I switched to reverse, to rock out of it, but it was to no avail. We were stuck.

""Hello?"" It was my dad's sleepy voice. ""Is something…""

""Are there more words to the lullaby?"" I screamed.

""What?""

More metal crushing from the back and now the rear doors. The rats were eating through the goddamn car. My heart dropped when I saw the empty car seat in the back. A horrid thought flashed in my brain - would I even get a chance to meet Mac?

The piper kept playing. The rats kept eating. I kept panicking, but I held it long enough to ask, ""Dad, what are the other words to the song?""

""Uh, I used to only sing the, hold on. Gail, Gail, what were the words to that horrid German song we used to sing?""

I could hear my mom waking from her sleep. Simultaneously, another rat jumped on the hood of the car. It hissed and started gnashing at the windshield. Ann screamed. That got my mom moving.

""What's wrong?"" my mom asked, her voice panicking.

""I'll fill you in later. What about the song?""

""Umm, Go out at night and….""

""No, after that. After the moon frowning.""

""Umm, let me think.""

The windshield spider-webbed as the rat broke a small hole in the glass. ""Mom! Hurry!""

""Umm, If the moon brings forth your doom, umm, pray for the sun to return soon…or something like that.""

""I pray to whoever the fuck is listening - God, Buddha, the Sun - to return and burn these fucking things to ash!""

""Please,"" Ann added.

CRASH! The rat on the hood of the car had broken the entire windshield out. I reached over and grabbed Ann's hand. I gave it a squeeze. ""Baby, I'm so sorry. I love you more than you'll ever know,"" I said, tears flooding my eyes.

""I love you, too. Mac and I both,"" she blubbered. We closed our eyes and waited for the end. I knew the next thing I'd feel would be the gnawing of wooden teeth against my bones.

But that didn't happen.

Instead, I felt an intense warming sensation spread across my body. Through closed eyelids, the darkness purpled until it was bright red. I opened my eyes, and an intense yellow light immediately stung me. It was coming from the middle of our yard.

I shielded my eyes with my hands but tried to sneak a peek between my fingers. But the light was too intense to get a look. I heard sizzling and screaming as the rat on the hood ignited and melted into a puddle of black goo. It slid off the car, leaving a trail of sludge and a mark on the cement.

All the rats were melting.

I put the car in park, pushed open the door, and, against Ann's screaming, stepped into the street. The light had dimmed from its peak but hadn't gone out totally. But the intensity was such that I could see it clearly now. A ball of pure, pulsating yellow light hovering in my front yard.

""What the hell?""

I assumed dozens of neighbors would come rushing out of their homes to see what the commotion was, but nothing stirred. The light had done the impossible - cause a ruckus in the suburbs without attracting a Karen. The only thing the light bothered was the rats. The rats and one other thing.

The piper.

The figure was standing near the glowing ball, staring at it. It no longer had any interest in me. It raised the horn to play again, but a blast of white light from the ball ignited the piper's hand. The figure turned to run, but it was already too late. The ball of light flashed again. It was so bright it briefly lit up the entire neighborhood. The heat was so intense and focused that, in mere seconds, it reduced the pied piper to a pile of ash.

Literally, in a flash, the piper was gone.

The ball of light rotated toward me. We stared at each other for a beat. I didn't know what to do, so I nodded at it. A non-verbal thank you from a flesh and blood human. It quickly flashed three times before winking out. As it did, something heavy thudded on the grass. I was standing in the dark again.

""Is it gone?"" Ann asked, climbing out of the car.

""I...I think.""

""Jesus,"" she said, laughing. ""Our car is fucked.""

I made my way over to where I'd heard the object fall. As I got to where the glowing ball had been, I saw a perfect circle burned into my lawn. Inside that circle was the carved depiction of the smiling sun from the crib's headboard.

""Holy shit,"" I said, picking it off the ground. It was slightly warm to the touch but didn't burn my hands. In fact, I found the warmth comforting. Like a hug.

Ann joined me. She delicately ran her fingertips over the carving. ""We have to keep this. It saved us.""

""Yeah,"" I said, reaching out and touching her belly. ""It saved all of us.""

With perfect comic timing, Ann said, ""The rest of the crib has to go, though."" We laughed like idiots for ten minutes.

Afterward, I managed to guide my busted ass car back into the driveway. As Ann had declared, it was truly fucked. How the hell would I explain this to Geico?

I called my parents back and told them what had happened. They didn't doubt me. They were at the house fifteen minutes later and stayed the rest of the night. Dad even helped me drag the crib to the curb.

""Who did you order this crib from?"" I asked.

""Someone on the marketplace.""

""Show me.""

Ann brought up her phone messages and searched. She scrolled…and scrolled…and scrolled. She stopped, confused. ""The messages are gone.""

""Maybe the ad is still up in the store?"" I asked, knowing the answer already.

It wasn't. Just another layer of ""What the hell?"" to an already well-layered ""Fuck this"" cake. Ann told me everything she could remember about the account she messaged with but had limited information because who would bother to remember anything like that? She was hunting for a decent sale, not making a best friend. Turns out, she found neither.

Everyone else has fallen asleep. I'm sitting in my office, staring at the carved sun and writing this out. I'm hoping someone out there might shed some light on this for me. Has anyone heard this song? Does anyone know anything about the crib? Or how the moon and sun figure into it? Where was the land the piper was showing me? Shit, why was the pied piper part of it?

How screwed up were my ancient relatives?

Best as I can tell, and granted, this is all speculation on my part, is that the song may have activated the crib. In turn, that awakened the face on the moon, which activated the piper. I don't know what the energy ball was. I have no clue how the person selling this thing tracked Ann down. I don't see how any of this, well, magic works. All I know is that this entire ordeal felt predetermined.

I can't shake that feeling. That forces beyond my understanding and unconstrained by time and space aligned in just a way to kill me off. The uneasy feeling that this was supposed to happen to me. Like my bloodline was supposed to end tonight. What about my linage pissed off the moon? What horrid curse is in my blood…and am I passing it down to Mac?

We stopped the piper for now, but I'm worried he might return. I plan to hang the carved sun in Mac's room for protection - probably over his regular-ass Amazon Basic's crib. The boy will be the centerpiece of the room…not his creepy German bed.

It's silent in the house now. There's no piper music in my head, but I keep expecting to hear it again. He showed me some strange land, which must've been important to me or my family. Right? He was trying to lure me somewhere…but where? And why?

I'm going to put on a pot of coffee. I'm not sleeping tonight. Not until the sun rises, anyway. I'll take all the protection I can get.",5,1737340331.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

It was cold when I woke up. Smoke. Packing gear. Out of the tent. My friend isn't up. 'That's odd. That Vodka'll get ya.' I could've sworn I heard him over at the next camp earlier. ""Hey man, you up?"" Groggily, ""Yeah."" ""I'm tearing my gear down. I'll be ready in about 20."" Him slowly, ""Cool, I got your coffee this morning. Are you taking your tent?"" "" Yeah, I'm taking everything."" Him slowly, ""You know you can leave it here right?"" ""Yeah. I'm taking everything with me."" Still slowly, ""But you should just leave it here. It'll be fine."" 'This guy woke up, started drinking again, and passed out already. Great.' Me slightly annoyed, ""Look. I'm taking everything with me."" ""But what if we wind up back here? You won't have to set it up again."" 'Goddamnit.' ""I'm taking everything with me. If we wind up back here I'll set it back up. I typically do that every night on the road. It's no big deal."" ""Ok. Let me know when you're ready."" ""Will do."" Gear packed. ""Hey man, I'm ready."" ""Ok. Give me a minute."" ""You got it."" Smoke. Reddit. 

I get a message. ""I'm traveling near where you are on my way from Florida to California(?) for work. I'd like to meet you, if you're cool with it. I can probably take you out to dinner."" ""Yeah. I'm good with that. I got some things I gotta do today. I'm checking in to a hotel room a church is getting us later. I won't do anything to jeopardize that, just in case they require us to stay there. But yeah I'm good with meeting up.""

My friend gets his act together. Gear on. We head down the trail. Stop in next camp and talk to a couple dudes living out there too. And we're off. Down trail. Dodging lake sized puddles. Decide we're making things more difficult than they need to be. Back to trail. Pretty easy trip out of the woods.

My friend is being a little difficult. He seems to not be hearing what I'm saying. His ideas this morning are shit, and unfounded. He thinks the church is not gonna get us hotel rooms. No reason. He's just negative. We hit Family Dollar for smokes to prep for being in the hotel. Him, ""I got your pack of smokes man."" ""I'm good."" ""I'm doing it! I'm a giver."" I know sometimes I'll argue with somebody that wants to pay me back for helping them. I've learned to let them. ""Fair enough. I won't argue with you this morning."" 😆

I go around the building to get out of the biting wind. Drop gear. He sets his daypack down. ""I'll be right back."" 'No shit.' He goes inside. Back out five minutes later. ""Dude! I don't have my wallet on me."" He searches his pack. ""It's gotta be in my tent."" ""Go check. I'll be here when you get back."" More reddit. He calls about fifteen monite later, ""I'm on my way. Coming through the fields now. I'm hustling."" ""Cool."" No need for the call, but I know he means well. This just isn't the same guy I've been hanging out with for the last couple weeks. He comes around the corner, hands me a pack of smokes and a new lighter. Me, ""I've got a backup lighter in my pack. I don't need this."" He promised to buy a lighter for someone back at camp. He's just bought two lighters. He needs one. I can do the math. ""Here. Take it."" ""Ok, thanks."" We head for Hardee's.

""We don't have coffee. We quit making it after breakfast."" 'Fuck this place.' ""Let's go to McDonald's. They'll have coffee"" ""I hate McDonald's. Me, ""Well I'm after caffeine, and at this point I don't give a fuck about their business practices."" We go. Coffee. He buys us each a cheeseburger. 'Nice!'

I tell him a story about the time I got pulled off the streets and wound up playing with Eric Clapton. He's loving the story but every time I mention bass players he's talking shit about them. And none of it is legit. There was a lot of my time as a musician where I would tell anyone the reason I loved playing guitar as well as I did was because I got to play with good bass players and drummers.

I set him straight on bass players in no uncertain terms. He accepts it. We bail to the library. He hits a computer. I go to my chair. All the way there his attitude is shit. His ideas about what we should do are shit, and make no sense. Charging my stuff. Announcement over the library PA about rides to hotel rooms. I pack my stuff. Him, ""Wait here. I gotta go talk to someone."" It's minutes until we're gonna miss our ride. ""I'm going outside."" He ignores me and bails. I shoot  him a text, ""I told you I was going outside. Come get your stuff. I'm not standing here while you dick around."" Downstairs and out the door I go. I'm done with his bullshit at this point. 

Find a seat outside. He comes up a few minutes later. He's being a dick to other homeless asking for details on the hotel rooms. I cut him off. Explain details nicely. 

I lay into him about being a dick, not listening to me all morning, etc. He apologizes. Still talking about stupid ideas we should do that make no sense at all. Apologizes again. 

Stupid ideas all the way to the hotel. I start cutting him off and telling him whatever he's talking about is a non-issue. 

We knew they were gonna pack us in four deep in a room. We get another two guys together that are sensible. Hit hotel. Get through check in with church people, off to room. My friend is still non sensical. I keep cutting him off. Then I ignore him all together.  He gets the hint. I go outside for a smoke.

Reddit. Message from dude coming through, ""I'm still about two hundred miles out. Let me know when you get settled in. Tell me where you're at."" Message back, ""Just got in. I'll get back to you shortly."" Back inside. Look up address. Text dude that and my number, ""Text me when you get here.""

I took the nicest shower in so long I can't remember. The room is nice. As a guy who has built hotels I'd say this one was remodeled in the last year. Everything is new. No bugs. No tweakers. No bullshit. 'Not bad.' Nice beds. 

I get an email. Nice redditor I helped out a couple days ago has come into some money, sends me back what I sent her plus some. 'Holy shit! That's awesome! This girl's legit!' We're on text messaging terms now. We chat a bit. Much thanks from me.

I mention it to my friend.  He says something kinda shitty. I school him. I have no intention of hitting him, but he had best change his ways and apologize. This is a friend of mine who has proven to me she's one of the good ones in the world. I don't consider a lot of people a true friend. You fuck with one of my friends I'll drop everything immediately, travel across the country and beat your ass. I've done it before.

I realize he's drunk, been in a shit mood all day, and this isn't his normal behavior. He gets a serious talking to. I am NOT fucking around. At all. He apologgizes profusely. I didn't yell or raise my voice. But I think he new he was poking an angry dog that was not caged. Fair enough. We're cool.

Sitting in a chair. Charging. Reddit. Screwing around on the internet. Look over. Friend is passed out. Talking in his sleep. Still passed out. Not talking in his sleep.

Get a text from dude. He's outside. ""I'm on my way. I gotta be back by 8:30 or I'll be outside with no gear."" Downstairs. Outside.

I mistake him for a homeless guy staying at the hotel. (Sorry man! 😆) Say something about, ""These rooms are nice huh?"" ""Thanks for meeting with me. I wanted meet you face to face for five minutes..."" We talk. Tells me about his son dying on the streets. Says he's got a place in Central Florida. I'm welcome to stay there. Has some work for me. I give him brief rundown about leaving the boat because I ran out of money, I'm out looking for work. We smoke and chat. He offers me a smoke. ""I'm good. Got plenty."" We have some similarities in background. Offer stands to come by, hang out and do some work. Him, ""I know you're pressed for time. I offered to buy you dinner. Here take this."" Hands me some cash. ""Thanks man. I appreciate it."" ""Call me when you head back to Florida."" ""Will do.""

I've been actively trying to quit for 4 years. 
I realize I'm on this hamster wheel an I just don't want to be doing this anymore.
I have many reasons to quit and the pros of quitting most definitely outway the cons. 
This week I'm quitting. I will do a one week wean (7days). 
I was caffeine free until 20 years old.
Then I began having black tea with cream and sugar at the end of a meal to stop me from bringing because I suffered from a bringing disorder then, and it helped give me a lid to the pod sort of speak. 
I got influenced from people around me to start coffee/ lattes, now two kids later and 32, I'm hooked. I'm scared when I quit il become fat again (not that I was but definitely borderline) because my eating will get out of control again. I guess I'm scared of alot of things. I bringed because it would help my anxiety go down. Now I'm scared about all the feelings quitting will bring.
I guess I'm just not looking forward to the withdrawals. 
Please wish me luck and if you have any tips or would like to share a bit of your story I would love to hear. ",2,1737339878.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Always had a little crush on him because he is appealing to my eyes. We somehow end up really close and he tells me in a random night that he has feelings for me but for external and internal factors he knew nothing would happened. We move on still as friends because we are both in our own shit. Like two month passes and we hang out like a celebration (just the two of us), he ends up admitting that I make him happy and that he cares about me and somehow we ended up kissing. Then we go back to him telling me that he doesn’t want to led me on but he’s moving away and the idea of us being in a relationship is not something tangible bc of valid reasons but that if we could maintain the friendship as best as we can. After a month we decided to have coffee together. And this is where it gets interesting and I would like to know if he’s still open to the idea of us having at least something physical or casual (I haven’t been able to talk to him about it) 

When we met up… He pretty much acted very warm, open. He first hugged me (which he never does), we catch up and I can tell he’s not able to stop looking at my lips, he kinda shits on a guy that tried to hit on me, asks me more about my personal life, is talking very low which made me had to get closer to him multiple times, his feet were always pointing at me in a way, if he wasn’t fidgeting around with his hands then it was his legs (he normally doesn’t do this), he’s okay with me getting closer, he smiles a lot and looks at me while laughing, but every time when we were quiet then he couldn’t look at me. When we are leaving he kinda follows me to my car, he hugged me once again I touched his stomach he’s okay with me doing that, says he’s glad that he saw me. Then for a reason we share chapstick and then he just stared me in quietness but I just got into my car and left. What do yall think? Was he just nervous that we got to see each other again? What do I need to pay attention if he’s still interested in me for the next few weeks? ",4,1737339871.0,bodylanguage,1,0.75,False

The crypto world is buzzing louder than a crowded LA club, and for good reason. President-elect Donald Trump is about to take the stage, and with him, the markets are already throwing a wild pre-party. With January 20th right around the corner, traders are eyeing some serious gains, dubbing this anticipated market wave the ""Trump Pump."" Love him or hate him, his entry is shaking things up, making memecoins and crypto darlings like $SOL and $XRP the talk of the town.  

💥 $SOL, a.k.a the smooth operator of blockchains, is crushing resistance like it’s breaking hearts. Trading at $270 and heating up fast—this baby is aiming for the stars (and maybe $350). Traders are already lighting Twitter on fire with SOL memes and predictions.  

🔥 Meanwhile, $XRP isn’t just riding a wave; it's making its own tide. Ripple’s legal drama might get that fairytale ending traders have been waiting for. Hovering at $3.2 with eyes on the $4 prize, this bad boy has all the makings of a breakout star.  

But wait—hold your champagne because there’s a wildcard in the mix: the Trump memecoin. It’s bold, brash, and already flexing a whopping $38 billion FDV. If you’re following the vibes, this could be the cherry on top for risk-takers.  

Get your coffee and your charts because January 20th might just be the hottest day in crypto so far. Are you ready for this ride—or do you need a hug and a $YOI token after?

1i5fpf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/minipainting/comments/1i5fpf1/efficient_miniature_painting_seeking_feedback_on/,Efficient miniature painting: Seeking feedback on my Wash Chop & Speedpaint plan,"# TL;DR

I’m returning to miniature painting after giving up on it 15 years ago and want to paint Nemesis and STALKER minis efficiently with my younger brother. My current plan is to use the ""wash chop"" technique (white prime → dark wash → white drybrush → Speedpaints 2.0). I’ve done a lot of research but want to know:

1. **Have I missed anything important?**
2. **Any advice or pitfalls for my chosen techniques?**

I’ll share my results in a few weeks!

# Background

I will receive a total of 100+ minis as part of the Nemesis and STALKER board game orders, which I plan to paint with my younger brother. I want to avoid the mistakes I made 15 years ago with WH40k minis (e.g., overly dark paint jobs on my Daemonhunter minis). My goal is to have fun, achieve good results efficiently, and make the most of limited painting time (half a day per week).

# Goals

My goal isn’t to become a pro but to enjoy the hobby with my brother while achieving visually satisfying results. Efficiency and simplicity are key, as I can only dedicate half a day per week to painting.

# Research on Efficient Techniques

There are many techniques for painting minis, each with its own proponents. For me, efficiency is key—I want good shading, lighting, and color without requiring advanced skills or excessive time.

**Contrast Paints & Speedpaints 2.0**

* **Pros**
   * Automatically sink into recesses for shading
   * Deliver good color quality and time efficiency
* **Cons**
   * Hard to predict final colors (dark before drying, vague bottle labeling)
   * Mistakes are punishing; fixing requires re-priming
   * Limited control over shading flow

# Slap Chop Technique

I like its ability to create grimdark contrasts. But slap chop with speedpaints tends to result in overly dark and desaturated minis, even when professionals use it ([examples](https://youtu.be/gT2JV3Ks41g?t=836), [examples](https://youtu.be/r6QYfLulklQ?t=282), [examples](https://youtu.be/sfdFC7K8UIk?t=505)). While some suggest using grey primer ([Dana Howl example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DZznl9ZbcE)) there and here ([Goobertown video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT2JV3Ks41g)) we see that this can still lead to undesirably dark results, especially on the faces.

# Preferred Approach: Pale/Wash Chop

This method balances contrast and vibrant colors:

* C[omparison video](https://youtu.be/HeXPawTuxXs?t=132) showing white prime + wash vs slap chop (no dry brush afterwards)
* [Howl’s example](https://youtu.be/fLDStOW7DMM?t=476) includes dry brushing
* Lyla Mev does it too and calls it ""wash cop"" and uses colored washes ot just a dark one: [video](https://youtu.be/r6QYfLulklQ?t=373)

While the dark areas are not as pronounced as slap chop, this method avoids dulling the colors and works efficiently. 

# Technique Conclusion

After this research, my preferred technique is the ""wash chop"", which combines efficiency with good contrast and vibrant colors. The steps are:

1. **Prime in white:** Use a rattle can, create a smooth, even base coat
2. **Apply a dark wash:** Use Nuln Oil or AP Dark Tone on all textured parts of the model, both do the job very similaryl well
3. **Drybrush with white acrylic:** Use a high-pigment artist-grade white paint, like Schmincke Primacryl Titanium White. As bonus: Applying more from above to downwards creates a zenithal lighting effect
4. **Apply Speedpaints:** Use Speedpaints 2.0 for time-efficient color application

This approach strikes a great balance for me: it retains enough white areas to maximize the vibrancy of speedpaints/contrast paints, while also providing adequate shading and depth. It avoids the overly dark, desaturated look of slap chop while maintaining a similar level of contrast.

# Drybrushing

I’ve never tried drybrushing before, and opinions on details of how to do it the best way vary widely. Here’s what I’ve gathered so far:

1. **Preparing the Brush**
   * Some sources suggest slightly dampening the brush for smoother results; this advice seems widely agreed upon
   * To remove excess paint, the most common method is dabbing on a paper towel. However, this can lead to a chalky texture. Alternatives include:
      * A **texture palette** (e.g., [Dana Howl's custom version](https://youtu.be/ILjqs2VoUXo?t=631))
      * A **self-healing cutting mat**, though it’s harder to measure how much paint remains
   * Brushes: Options include drybrushing-specific tools, makeup brushes, or others, depending on the desired effect.
2. **Choosing Paint**
   * High-pigment, professional-grade white acrylics (e.g., Schmincke Primacryl Titanium White) are recommended for their stronger whiteness compared to standard miniature paints
3. **Practical Benefits**
   * Drybrushing helps smooth out any pooling or ""coffee staining"" from dark washes

For a comprehensive overview, I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtD1kyz5slk) especially helpful, covering most of the techniques and tips I’ve taken note of.  


# Speedpaints

I plan to invest in the 50 Speedpaints 2.0 set for a wide range of colors. Here’s what I’ve learned about using them effectively:

1. **Challenges and Solutions**
   * **Unpredictable Colors:** The paint appears very dark before drying, and bottle labels are vague ([example video](https://youtu.be/kTIRVX74u0g?t=580)). To address this:
      * Refer to Stahly's swatch comparison: [Tale of Painters swatches](https://taleofpainters.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ToP_The_Army_Painter_Speedpaint_hand-painted_swatch_V2.0.jpg.webp)
      * Ideally, create your own swatch for real-life reference, although I haven’t decided how to approach this yet
   * **Fixing Mistakes:** Errors with Speedpaints are punishing; fixing requires covering mistakes with white acrylic and repainting. To minimize visible errors, start with darker colors and layer brighter ones last ([tip source](https://www.reddit.com/r/minipainting/comments/187dsnw/comment/kbdsp43/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))
2. **Additional Tips**
   * This guide on contrast paint techniques offers a lot of helpful advice: [Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/11l28rx/comment/jba23s9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

# Speedpaint Metallics

Speedpaint metallics behave differently from standard Speedpaints. They have higher opacity, which reduces the visibility of underlying shading. This characteristic can be seen in [this detailed comparison video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAhPlY_YIlU).

# General Consensus

* Many YouTubers and Reddit users stated that that they were unhappy with the Speedpaint metallics ([example 1](https://youtu.be/kTIRVX74u0g?t=747), [example 2](https://youtu.be/UrlbZddNO0Q?t=634))
* Reportedly they perform better when applied over a silver or metallic base coat

**Testing and Recommendations**

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A6Uq78huwE) provides one of the most comprehensive tests of Speedpaint metallics over different undercoats. Here Vince Venturella demonstrated to me that Speedpaint metallics can likely work well in a wash chop setup, since it is not too different form the zenithal black-to-white undercoat he recommends.

In conclusion, while Speedpaint metallics may not be the best option for intricate metallics, they can be useful in specific setups, particularly with proper base preparation.

# Next Steps

I’ve outlined my plans and research and am eager to hear your feedback. Specifically: 

* Have I missed any key techniques, tools, or considerations that could help me achieve my goals? 
* Are there any pitfalls in my chosen approach (wash chop + Speedpaints) that I should watch out for?

Please keep in mind that I’m a beginner with no finished minis to show yet. My knowledge comes from collecting insights from various sources and making observations, but I’m still figuring things out.  
  
I’m constantly refining my approach based on feedback, yours included.  I plan to share pictures of my progress and results in a few weeks. Thank you in advance for your advice and constructive criticism!

So here are some examples of that happening to me or my coworkers. (LONG POST LONG POST LONG POST!!!!!!)



Example 1: *literally already steamed the milk and is adding it to the latte*

Customer : “that was made with nonfat milk right?” 

Me: “no it wasn’t made with nonfat because the sticker doesn’t say nonfat but I can remake make that for you”

What I really wanted to say: “obviously it wasn’t made with nonfat because it wasn’t ordered with non fat DUHHHH! IF YOU WANT NON FAT ORDER NON FAT !”



Example 2: *guy orders a grande pike with no cream and 2 sugars*

Customer: *receives coffee* “thanks and this has the stevia sugar right?”

Me: “umm sorry no you didn’t specify stevia sugar so we just used normal sugar” 

Customer:” OH NOPE I CANT HAVE NORMAL SUGAR I NEED STEVIA”


ME: “no problem I can get you another coffee with stevia” 

What I wanted to say: “ IF YOU NEED A SPECIFIC SUGAR THEN REQUEST THE SPECIFIC SUGAR DONT JUST ASSUME WE KNOW WHAT SUGAR YOU CAN AND CANT HAVE”




Example 3: *im adding pumps of syrup to a cup* 

Customer: “oh I only wanted two pumps of syrup” 

Me: “oh ok no problem”  *throws cup away and restarts* 

Me: *adding 3 shots of espresso to the cup*

Customer: “oh I actually only wanted 2 shots of espresso” 

Me: “sure no problem” *restarts drink AGAIN*

Me: *hands customer their drink 

Customer: “ oh thank you and this is decaf right cause I can only drink decaf” 

Me: no so unfortunately you didn’t specify any of these alterations when ordering so the drink is not decaf but I can remake it for you”
