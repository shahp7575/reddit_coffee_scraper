1r3i7ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1r3i7ya/camping_and_hiking_has_become_my_reset_button/,Camping and hiking has become my reset button from tech burnout!,"I manage an outbound sales team at a B2B SaaS company. My entire life is screens: Emails, Slack, Zoom calls, dashboards, spreadsheets, etc.



Started going camping once a month about 4 months ago. Just me, a tent, basic gear, and zero connectivity (I turn my phone completely off). The difference it makes for my mental health is wild.



Coming back Monday morning, I'm actually excited about work instead of dreading opening my laptop. Things I've learned is that one doesn't need fancy gear, just basic work fine.



Camping alone is less scary than it sounds, coffee tastes better when made over a campfire (might be a placebo, but I don't care), and 48 hours without screens is actually enough to reset.



My team thinks it's weird that I voluntarily go sit in the woods alone. My partner gets it but doesn't want to join (she prefers hotels, fair enough). Anyone else in tech jobs using outdoor time as a mental health strategy? What works for you?",2,1770965328.0,CasualConversation,0,1.0,False

1r3i7of,https://www.reddit.com/r/restaurant/comments/1r3i7of/fast_food_restaurant_tier_list_from_my_experience/,Fast Food Restaurant Tier List from My Experience,"# Elite

* Chipotle: I could eat Chipotle every day of my life if I had to. The problem with Chipotle is the quantity, they fuck you, especially if you Door Dash, they fuck you.
* A&W: A&W is my favorite fast food restaurant ever. If I was dying on death row and they said, ""You have one more meal,"" that meal would be a Papa Burger combo with an extra-large root beer and probably one of those medium polar swirls.
* McDonald's: McDonald's is elite, I don't give a fuck what anyone says. The fries, their burgers, their breakfast sandwiches, I do agree they're getting a little bit expensive now but I love the Golden Arcs.
* Culver's: Culver's is right up there with A&W neck and neck. That's King Kong versus Godzilla right there.
* Texas Roadhouse: This place bangs. Don't even get me started on the fucking bread either. For like $16 I can go get a steak, a loaded baked potato, and then either a Caesar salad or a cup of delicious chili.
* Popeye's: They have the best spicy chicken sandwich in the world right now on the planet.
* Dairy Queen: I love Dairy Queen's food, their flamethrower burger, their double bacon cheeseburger, their chicken strips with the white gravy and the toast. The Blizzard, specifically the S'mores Blizzard, that's another death row meal very close to A&W too.
* Jersey Mike's: This is my sub shop next to Potbelly. Jersey Mike's, so fresh, so delicious, you got to get the vinegar and oil on it, I could eat it every day.
* Potbelly: Jersey Mike's and Potbelly is 1A and 1B for me.
* Chick-fil-A: Can never go wrong with CFA. Spicy chicken with pepper jack is the way. Is a little tad overrated though from what I've heard. Is it worth making your entire personality revolving around eating it fucking four times a week? No.

# Very Good

* Arby's: Thing about Arby's is you can't strafe away from the basics there, you got to go and just get the sliders. If you get a Buffalo chicken slider or a hot beef slider that shit is very good.
* Taco Bell: It's not quite elite but it's also very good. Trust me, the crunchy spicy potato taco, you're going to have a phenomenal meal. That potato taco is low-key the best thing on the menu, trust me, the sauce is.
* Auntie Anne's: Very good because I love pretzels. A hot salty pretzel with some cheese sauce, are you kidding me?
* Shake Shack: I had it once and I thought it was actually quite good. Burgers were greasy and I still remember them being tasty.
* Checkers: I had it once and it was outstanding. All I remember about it is the burger that they gave you weighed about 10 fucking pounds and their fries are deliciously seasoned.
* Cinnabon: If you don't like delicious little cinnamon pillows filled with cream, get the fuck out.
* Domino's: When you're in the mood for Domino's, that shit is great, and also that 2 for $6.99 deal, you're not beating that anywhere else.
* Five Guys: Horribly overpriced. The burger was absolutely delicious. You HAVE to get your fries well-done. HAVE to.
* Papa John's: Papa John's is great. One of if not the best pizza chains out there.
* Krispy Kreme: I love Krispy Kreme, just a glazed doughnut, can't even describe to you how heavenly it is.

# Nickelback

* Burger King: Forcefully hated. People love to hate it for absolutely no reason, Burger King is actually pretty good.
* Subway: Subway gets a lot of shit. Yes, their prices have become stupid but I'm always satisfied after I eat a Subway sandwich. It's good, it fills you up. For some reason they have the best mayonnaise too, I don't know why.
* White Castle: People act like this place is inconsumable when in reality it's just an acquired taste. If you like onion and you get a fresh White Castle burger you are going to have a blast. This place is a lot like Arby's, just don't venture away from the basics.
* Olive Garden: Olive Garden is like a meme restaurant to some people. I get it's a chain but like it's good and their chicken dumpling soup, holy shit so good.
* KFC: People act like it's trash food, the fuck it is. A bucket of their fried chicken fresh almost impossible to beat and they have a delicious peach Mountain Dew there.

# Decent, But Nothing Special

* Baskin-Robbins: Decent but nothing special, it's ice cream.
* Panda Express: I mean, it's chicken and rice, it's okay.
* Hooters: I have eaten at a Hooters before, it was decent. If you're going to Hooters as a 21-year-old or older, I'm going to be honest, the food is pretty irrelevant.
* Crumbl Cookies: Decent. The cookies are good but the problem I have with them is the cookies weigh about 15 fucking pounds per cookie so I have to eat them in like quarters.
* TGI Fridays: Decent, I mean it's a fucking TGI Fridays like what do you expect.
* Pizza Hut: This place is weird because everything there is good except the pizza. It's fucking crazy.
* Sonic: I would say painfully overrated but the hype has really died down. Went there once and got a burger, it was a burger.
* Wendy's: Sometimes I'll have it and I'm like ""This is really good"" and sometimes I'll have it and I'm disappointed. I also think you need a leaf blower to get all the salt off the fries.
* Red Robin: Decent, fries are okay, burgers are fine.
* Dunkin': Decent, I just had a cup of coffee, I mean, it was a cup of coffee.
* Starbucks: It's coffee.
* Nathan's Hot Dogs: Decent, had it in the airport, it was just an ordinary hot dog and fries.
* Hardee's: Their burgers were fine but half the time I got them there was so much sauce on them that my hands would be just destroyed by the second bite.
* Red Lobster: Decent, I think they're carried by their biscuits.
* Denny's: Decent, pretty good for breakfast food. Kind of hard to fuck up bacon and eggs though and if you do you should be in jail.
* Panera: One of my favorite cups of mac and cheese on the planet. Their soup in the bread bowl is delicious, their sandwich is scrumptious, the side of bread you get with the butter. Sad how overpriced and lower quality they've become though. Everything else on their menu is hospital food.

# Overrated

* Cold Stone: Is it good ice cream? Yes it is. But if I blindfolded you and threw Dairy Queen and Cold Stone in front of you and they had the same consistency you would not tell the difference.
* In-N-Out: Painfully overrated and I mean painfully. People act like if you go to a state or a city that has an In-N-Out you have to go there like it is just the biggest gem. I think you have to go there to see how average it is, it's a fucking burger and fries.
* Firehouse Subs: A decent sub sandwich except the portion they give you is like if you were a fucking first grader. Never ever full after Firehouse.
* Jimmy John's: Talk about never being full.

# Tolerable

* Buffalo Wild Wings: Tolerable at this point. BWW has probably had the most consistent downfall out of any restaurant I have ever seen. They do not listen to people at all. Wings have gotten smaller, sauce has gotten less, service has gotten slower, the place is just really not that great anymore and they're just overpriced.
* Chuck E. Cheese: Tolerable. I don't know what I was expecting, but I didn't find it special and I thought their crust was kind of gross.
* Dave & Buster's: I had it one time and I thought it tasted like I was eating at a gas station which, I mean, you can tolerate gas station food, but you don't want to go back.

# Ass

* Little Caesars: Little Caesars is ass, I'm sorry. The last couple times I've had it it has been atrocious. Imagine choking that down after a rough day.
* Cici’s Pizza: I can still remember this being the worst pizza I've ever eaten. It was like a buffet but all the pizza looked like it had been sitting out for hours, it was shit.
* Long John Silver's: When you eat fresh caught fish forever (me) and then you go somewhere like Long John Silvers and get fast food fish, it's not even the same meal.
* Applebee's: Applebee's tastes like microwaved garbage trash from my experience, it's horrible. If you actually go there and try to have an enjoyable meal, the service is also like the most garbage thing ever.
* Whataburger: It's fucking garbage. If you eat a cheeseburger drunk and it's bad, you know that shit is ass.
* Quiznos: Every single time my mom got it, I was fucking furious.
* IHOP: As my dad would say, that place could choke a flea.",1,1770965301.0,restaurant,0,1.0,False

1r3i5zy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r3i5zy,Are These Tiny Manifestations or Am I Delusional!!,"&#x200B;

Okay guys I need to tell you something and you tell me if this is normal or if I’m just doing elite level pattern recognition 😭..

These are my tiny food “manifestations” lol.

so the first one:

My sister sent me a picture of white sauce pasta she made. We live in different cities so I couldn’t just go eat it. And in my house ordering food randomly is not really a thing. It’s kind of a luxury, not an everyday thing.

I saw that picture and I wanted it so bad. Like intensely.

Three hours later my dad randomly wins a quiz and gets invited to a restaurant with free food for the family. He calls me and asks what I want,I say white sauce pasta and I get it the same day...

Okay fine,Maybe coincidence.

Second one.

I once tasted a very specific dish from my friend’s lunchbox. I loved it and thought wow I wish mom would make this. But I never told her. I literally forgot about it.

Important detail. That dish had not been cooked in our house for eight to nine months...

Next morning, Sunday, she randomly says she’s making that exact dish for breakfast.I never mentioned it go her like Not even once,so i was like lowkey surprised😭

Now third one is the  burger story because this one is detailed....

In the morning I watched Jungkook’s live highlight where he was eating a burger, fries and drinking cold coffee(ig you all know which live I'm talking about lol😭)For eighteen whole minutes I was staring more at the burger than at him. Please don’t judge me. I just love burger 😭

Fast food at my house is not common, It’s like a luxury. So I was just quietly wanting it....

While he was eating fries with ketchup I literally thought nahh bro I don’t even like ketchup.... Jungkook bruh our choices are not same if i ever eat something I'd love to eat it without any sauce....

That same evening my uncle visited. We actually went out planning to eat street food but on the way it got late so our plan changed in the middle of the road and we went to a restaurant instead.

and coincidentally we went to the restaurant of which burgers are so famous and tasty he asked me what i want and i immediately said burger😭I was internally losing it.He asked if I wanted fries too. But at that moment I didn’t really feel like eating fries so I said no.

I ordered a Coke because that’s what I wanted then. After that he even asked if I wanted cold coffee...

Now here’s the very specific part.

When the food came, there was no ketchup on the table😭😭

Usually they automatically give ketchup with burgers and fries. My uncle even noticed and said hey they forgot to give ketchup.

And I just said it’s okay I don’t like ketchup anyway.

I had literally thought about not wanting ketchup in the morning while watching that live.

okay the last one,

One day I tried calling my dad to tell him I wanted something. He cut the call because he was busy, I forgot about it because yeah I've adhd😭,then i suddenly remembered it The next day that oh i wanted that to eat and then I was like never mind and The same night he came home with that exact thing. Something I hadn’t eaten in like four months...I never reminded him about that😭

So I just want to ask,

Are these just small food manifestations lol. Does this happen to you guys too. Or am I just connecting random dots because my brain likes patterns.

Because it’s not like I’m scripting or obsessing. I just want it strongly for a moment and then I let it go.

And then somehow it shows up.

Be honest. Am I magical or just good at noticing coincidences 😭..

*\*3:00AM PST Start / 6:00AM EST Start*



**Why This Pick?**

The rivalry between these two teams makes me think this will be a tough battle, friends – I fully expect goals to be at a premium here. At the time of writing, it looks like Jacob Markstrom will get the start in net for Sweden, and I’ve gotta be honest: he’s not my favourite (lol). I wouldn’t be surprised if Finland pulled off an upset here despite being a heavy underdog with Juuse Saros in their corner, but I do think this game stops long before a total of 5. My money’s on the Under to cash.

1r3hycf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1r3hycf/how_to_actually_absorb_books_instead_of/,How to Actually ABSORB Books Instead of Speedrunning Through Them: The Science of Deep Reading,"Look, I've been there. You finish a book, feel like a genius for 10 minutes, then realize two weeks later you remember exactly nothing except maybe one quote you highlighted. You're not reading, you're just moving your eyes across pages and pretending knowledge is seeping into your brain through osmosis. Spoiler alert: it's not.

After diving deep into research on cognitive science, learning theory, and honestly just experimenting on myself like a lab rat, I figured out why most of us suck at retaining what we read. The problem isn't that you're dumb. The problem is you're treating reading like a race when it should be more like digesting a meal. You can't shove an entire steak down your throat and expect your body to extract all the nutrients. Same with books.

Here's what actually works.

**Step 1: Stop flexing about how many books you read**

Seriously. The Goodreads challenge is ruining your brain. When you're obsessed with hitting some arbitrary number like 52 books a year, you're optimizing for quantity, not quality. Your brain goes into collection mode instead of absorption mode.

James Clear (the Atomic Habits guy) talks about this. He doesn't track how many books he reads. He tracks how many ideas he actually implements. That's the whole point, right? To change your behavior, perspective, or understanding. Not to have impressive stats to humble-brag about at parties.

Reframe it: You're not trying to ""finish"" books. You're trying to let books finish their job on you, which is to transform how you think or act.

**Step 2: Read with a question in your head**

Your brain is lazy. If you don't give it a specific task, it'll just float through the pages on autopilot. Before you start any chapter or book, ask yourself a specific question you want answered.

Cal Newport (the Deep Work dude) does this thing called ""question-driven reading."" Don't just crack open a book and see what happens. Go in with purpose. Ask things like:

* ""How can I apply this to my actual life?""
* ""What's the one idea here that challenges what I currently believe?""
* ""What would change if I actually implemented this?""

When your brain has a mission, it pays attention differently. It's hunting for answers instead of just passively consuming words.

**Step 3: Slow the hell down and argue with the author**

This is where the magic happens. Stop being a passive receiver of information. Treat reading like a conversation, or better yet, a debate. When you read something, pause and ask:

* ""Do I actually agree with this?""
* ""What's an example from my own life that proves or disproves this?""
* ""What's the author missing here?""

Ryan Holiday talks about this in his reading method. He doesn't just highlight, he writes notes in the margins challenging or expanding on ideas. When you engage critically with the material, your brain has to work harder, which means deeper processing and better retention.

**Step 4: Stop highlighting everything like a maniac**

Highlighting feels productive. It's not. Studies show that passive highlighting barely improves retention at all. You're just making your book look pretty.

Instead, use the marginalia method. Write short notes in your own words. Summarize the main point of a paragraph or page. Ask questions. Draw connections to other books or ideas.

When you force yourself to translate the author's words into your own language, you're doing the cognitive heavy lifting that actually creates understanding. It's harder. That's the point.

**Step 5: Take ridiculous reading breaks**

Your brain needs processing time. You can't just mainline information for three hours straight and expect it all to stick. After every chapter or major section, stop and do something else for a bit.

Go for a walk. Make coffee. Stare at the wall like a psycho. During these breaks, your brain is actually working in the background, consolidating what you just read. This is called diffuse mode thinking, and it's when a lot of the real learning happens.

Barbara Oakley explains this in A Mind for Numbers (which is about way more than just math). Your brain has two modes: focused (when you're actively reading) and diffuse (when you're seemingly doing nothing but your brain is making connections). You need both.

**Step 6: Explain what you read to someone who doesn't care**

The Feynman Technique is ridiculously effective. After you finish a section, explain it out loud to an imaginary person, or better yet, a real person who will look at you like you're insane.

If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it. This method exposes the gaps in your understanding immediately. When you try to teach something, you're forced to organize the information coherently, which is exactly what creates deep learning.

Don't have anyone to bore? Write it out instead. Reddit posts, blog entries, journal entries, whatever. Just get it out of your head in your own words.

**Step 7: Create a ""commonplace book"" like you're from the 1800s**

This is an old-school technique that's making a comeback. Keep a dedicated notebook where you write down the most important ideas from what you read, along with your thoughts and how you might use them.

Ryan Holiday swears by this. He keeps index cards organized by topic. Robert Greene does something similar for his research. The physical act of writing (not typing) activates different parts of your brain and improves memory.

Plus, when you revisit your commonplace book, you're doing spaced repetition, which is proven to be one of the most effective learning techniques.

**Step 8: Read fewer books, reread the important ones**

Hot take: rereading is massively underrated. You're a different person than you were a year ago. You'll notice different things, make different connections, understand ideas that flew over your head the first time.

Nassim Taleb rereads books constantly. He says you don't really understand a book until you've read it at least twice. The first time you're just getting familiar with the landscape. The second time you're actually exploring it.

**App recs for actually retaining what you read:**

Readwise resurfaces your highlights at spaced intervals so you actually remember what you read. It integrates with Kindle, Instapaper, all that stuff. The spaced repetition algorithm is based on actual cognitive science, not just random reminders.

If you want a more structured approach to learning from books, there's BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by a team from Columbia and Google. It pulls insights from books, research papers, and expert interviews (including a lot of the cognitive science and learning theory stuff mentioned here) and creates customized audio lessons based on what you're trying to learn. You can set specific goals like ""actually retain what I read"" or ""develop better learning habits,"" and it builds an adaptive plan around that.

What makes it different is the depth control, you can switch between a quick 10-minute summary or a 40-minute deep dive with detailed examples depending on your energy level. Plus you get a virtual coach you can chat with to ask questions or get book recommendations. The voice options are surprisingly good, there's a smoky one that sounds like Scarlett Johansson in Her if you're into that.

**Step 9: Build a bridge between reading and doing**

Reading without action is just intellectual masturbation. Feels good, accomplishes nothing.

After finishing a book (or even a chapter), write down:

* One idea you're going to implement this week
* One belief you're reconsidering
* One action you're going to take differently

Make it specific. Not ""I'm going to be more productive."" More like ""I'm going to time-block my calendar every Sunday night for the next month and see what happens.""

**The books that'll change how you read:**

How to Read a Book by Mortimer Adler. Yeah, I know, it sounds condescending as hell. But this book is the bible of active reading. Adler breaks down different levels of reading, from elementary to syntopical (reading multiple books on the same topic and synthesizing them). It's dense but worth it.

Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning by Peter Brown, Henry Roediger, and Mark McDaniel. This book will blow up everything you think you know about learning. It's based on decades of cognitive research, and it'll show you why most of your reading habits are sabotaging your retention.

**Step 10: Accept that forgetting is normal**

The forgetting curve is real. You're going to forget most of what you read. That's just how human memory works. But here's the thing, the ideas that really matter will come back to you when you need them if you've done the work of actually processing them.

Stop stressing about remembering everything. Focus on understanding deeply and letting go of the rest.

**Bottom line:** Reading slowly isn't about being a snob or pretending you're smarter than everyone else. It's about actually getting something out of the time you invest. You can speedrun through 100 books and remember nothing, or you can deeply absorb 10 books and actually change your life.

Whether you’re a dev debugging code or a marketer building a brand, these frameworks move the needle from ""okay"" outputs to ""production-grade"" results.

# 1. The RC-T-CO Framework (Structure is Everything)

Stop sending one-sentence requests. Use this structure for every complex task:

* **Role:** Who is the AI? (e.g., Senior Python Dev, SEO Expert).
* **Context:** What is the background? (e.g., ""We are launching a Gen-Z coffee brand"").
* **Task:** What is the specific action? (e.g., ""Refactor this script"").
* **Constraints:** What should it *avoid*? (e.g., ""No external libraries"").
* **Output:** Format (e.g., Markdown table, JSON, H1 headers).

# 2. Logic Over Luck (CoT vs. ToT)

* **Chain of Thought (CoT):** Simply ask the AI to **""Think step-by-step.""** This forces the model to reason through logic before giving a (likely wrong) fast answer.
* **Tree of Thoughts (ToT):** For complex strategy, ask the AI to simulate **3 experts** critiquing each other’s ideas to find the ""Master Plan.""

# 3. Pattern Matching (Few-Shot Prompting)

If the AI isn't getting the tone right, stop explaining and start showing.

* **The Fix:** Give 2-3 examples of `Input -> Output` before asking your actual question. The AI will mirror the pattern perfectly.

# 4. Grounding the Model (RAG & ReAct)

* **RAG (Retrieval):** Don't let the AI guess facts. Upload your PDF/Doc and tell it: *""Use ONLY the provided file to answer.""*
* **ReAct:** For research, force a **Thought -> Action -> Observation** loop. This makes the AI search, read, and then conclude rather than hallucinating based on old training data.

# 5. Technical Constraints: The ""Blackboard"" Effect

LLMs have a **Context Window** (memory). Think of it as a blackboard. Once it’s full, the AI erases the top to write on the bottom.

* **Pro Tip:** If you're pasting 50+ emails or a massive log file, the AI *will* forget your initial instructions. Keep your core ""Constraints"" at the very bottom of the prompt to keep them fresh in the AI's ""working memory.""

1r3hsip,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Rough_Payment9102/comments/1r3hsip/stepbystep_integrating_ai_agents_into_your_crm/,Step-by-Step: Integrating AI Agents into Your CRM for Zero-Manual Data Entry,"I was sitting in a coffee shop the other day, watching a guy at the next table who looked like he was about to lose his mind. He was toggling between five different tabs, copying phone numbers from a spreadsheet into a CRM, then typing out a ""personalized"" email that definitely did not sound personal. It hit me that even in 2026, so many of us are still stuck doing the digital version of digging ditches. We buy all these fancy **sales tools**, but we still end up being the ""glue"" that holds the data together.

But it does not have to be that way anymore. With the rise of agentic AI, you can actually set up a system where you never have to manually log a call or update a deal stage again. Imagine having **best sales tools (jarvisreach dot io)** that do not just wait for you to click buttons but actually think and act for you. That is what we are talking about today.

**Why Manual Data Entry is Killing Your Sales Productivity**

Let us be honest, nobody gets into sales because they love administrative work. When you spend three hours a day updating your **sales management system**, you are losing three hours of actual selling time. This is a massive drain on **sales team efficiency**. I have seen teams where the CRM is basically a graveyard of half-finished notes because the reps just do not have the energy to keep up with the **lead management** after a long day of calls.

By integrating AI agents, you are not just adding another piece of **sales technology**; you are adding a digital team member. These agents can ""listen"" to your meetings, ""read"" your emails, and update your records in real time. This shift is the biggest boost to **sales productivity** I have seen in a decade.

**Step 1: Audit Your Current Lead Generation Tools**

The first thing you need to do is look at how leads are entering your world. Are you using **lead generation tools** that just spit out a CSV file? If so, that is your first bottleneck. In a modern setup, your **lead generation** should be a direct pipeline.

You want to pick **sales tools** that have open APIs or native integrations. For example, if you use **lead generation tools** like Clay or Apollo, they can find the data, but you need an AI agent to decide what to do with it. Does this lead fit your ICP? If yes, the agent should automatically create a contact in your **sales management system**. This is how you start building a ""zero-manual"" foundation.

**Step 2: Choose Your AI Agent for Lead Management**

Not all AI is created equal. Some **sales tools** are just simple ""if-this-then-that"" bots. But for true zero-manual entry, you need an agent that understands context. You need **sales technology** that can distinguish between a prospect saying ""I am busy today"" and ""I am not interested.""

The **best sales tools** for 2026 are those that act as a layer between your communication channels and your CRM. These agents sit in your meetings and use natural language processing to extract the ""MEDDIC"" or ""BANT"" criteria. Instead of you typing out ""Budget is fifty thousand,"" the agent just updates the budget field for you. This kind of **lead management** automation is what actually moves the needle on **sales team efficiency**.

**Step 3: Connect Your Communication Channels**

To make the ""magic"" happen, your AI agents need to be where the conversations are. This means connecting your **sales tools** to your email, your calendar, and your phone system. When you integrate these, the agent can see the whole picture.

* **Email Sync**: The agent drafts replies and logs the sentiment of the thread.
* **Meeting Capture**: The agent transcribes the call and identifies ""next steps.""
* **LinkedIn Integration**: The agent notes when a prospect changes jobs and updates the CRM record automatically.

This is the core of **sales productivity**. You are no longer the one reporting on the work; the work is reporting on itself. It makes your **sales management system** a live reflection of your pipeline, not a stale history book.

**Step 4: Map Your Sales Management System Fields**

This part is a little bit technical, but it is super important. You have to tell the AI agent exactly where to put the information. If your **lead generation tools** find a company's headcount, does that go in a ""Company Size"" field or a ""Notes"" section?

A well-mapped **sales management system** ensures that your data stays clean. I always recommend keeping it simple at first. Start with five or ten key fields that always need updating. Once the AI proves it can handle those with high **data accuracy**, you can expand. This is how you gradually increase **sales team efficiency** without breaking your current process.

**Step 5: Monitor and Refine Your Sales Technology**

Even the **best sales tools** need a little supervision at the start. For the first week, I usually tell people to have a ""human-in-the-loop"" phase. The AI agent proposes an update to the CRM, and you just hit ""approve.""

As the agent learns your specific nuances, you can take the training wheels off. You will find that your **sales productivity** starts to skyrocket once you trust the system. You are no longer hunting for information because it is already there. Your **lead generation** leads directly to qualified meetings, and your **lead management** happens while you sleep.

**Final Thoughts on the Future of Sales Tools**

The era of the ""data entry clerk masquerading as a salesperson"" is over. By using the right **sales tools** and integrating AI agents, you can finally focus on what you actually like doing: talking to people. This is the ultimate promise of **sales technology** in 2026.

It might feel a bit scary to let go of the manual control, but once you see your **sales management system** updating itself with perfect **data accuracy**, you will never want to go back. Your **sales team efficiency** will be the envy of your competitors, and your **lead generation** will finally feel like a well-oiled machine.",1,1770963859.0,u_Rough_Payment9102,0,1.0,False

1r3hovl,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaritaUniverse/comments/1r3hovl/threshold/,Threshold,"Luna Naval Command Annex, Shackleton Rim

04:17 LMT — 14 February 2069

The corridor smelled like recycled air and burnt coffee and the particular institutional hopelessness that characterized every military installation Kira Mäkinen had ever set foot in. Luna was no different. Luna was worse, actually, because the recycled air had nowhere to go. You breathed the same molecules the garrison had been breathing since 2041.

She badged through the second checkpoint without breaking stride.

“Commander Mäkinen.” The duty petty officer, third class, maybe twenty-two years old, straightened behind his console. “MNS Oura shows active operations. Mercury perihelion passage in—”

“Eleven hours, forty minutes. I have a clock, Petty Officer.”

“Yes, ma’am.”

She didn’t slow down.

The Command Pod Suite was at the end of a pressurized spoke that jutted from the main annex like an afterthought, which it was — the EU Compact had retrofitted it onto the original Chinese infrastructure in 2058 when remote substrate command became standard doctrine. The seams still showed. The welding was adequate. She’d long stopped caring.

Her pod was number seven. She keyed the hatch.

The room was the size of a large closet. A padded recliner angled at thirty degrees. Medical panel on the left wall, green across the board. The synchronization rig overhead — a brushed-aluminum housing roughly the size and shape of a domestic oven — studded with status indicators she’d stopped reading individually because she could read them in aggregate now, the way you stop reading words and start reading sentences.

She sat down. Ran through the checklist from memory, because the laminated card on the armrest was for sailors who needed laminated cards.

Neural interface calibrated. Sync-key authenticated. Relay substrate aboard Oura confirmed active — she could see the biometrics on the panel. The Bucket was keeping it alive. Heart rate 62. Core temperature 37.1. Substrate had been running passive for the last six hours while Oura’s XO handled routine approach vectors under standing doctrine.

Six hours passive was nothing. She’d left it passive for forty once, during the Hygeia incident. The substrate had come out of it with a faint tremor in the left hand that lasted four days.

She’d written in her report that she’d remained intermittently active throughout.

She fastened the cervical contact array around her neck. Lay back.

“Sync on my mark,” she said to the room. The room’s AI was listening.

“Standing by. Propagation delay to Oura current position: six minutes, fourteen seconds.”

“Mark.”

The first three seconds were always the same. A pressure behind the sternum that wasn’t actually pressure. A sense of the room she was lying in becoming simultaneously more and less real — the ceiling tiles staying exactly where they were while somehow receding. Her heartbeat audible, then not.

Then the handshake.

She didn’t have a better word for it. The quantum coherence establishing across six light-minutes of space between the neural interface on her neck and the relay substrate sealed inside the Bucket aboard a 5-tonne scout running dark on a polar Mercury approach. It wasn’t instant. There was a moment — not a delay, exactly, more like a seam in the air — where she existed in the closet on Luna and only the closet on Luna.

And then she didn’t.

The Oura‘s command feed opened around her like a room she’d walked into from a dark hallway.

Not visually. It was never visual, not the way people who’d never done it imagined. No screen. No cinematic window onto the stars. It was proprioceptive — she was the ship’s awareness. The substrate in the Bucket translated incoming sensor data into something the nervous system could parse. Bearing felt like direction. Range felt like depth. The temperature of the hull was background noise you stopped noticing the way you stopped noticing your shoes.

Mercury was nine hundred thousand kilometers ahead and to port. She knew this the way she knew where her own hand was.

“XO. Status.”

The AI executive officer’s voice came up immediately — it had been waiting, the way it always waited, with that quality of readiness that was either reassuring or faintly unsettling depending on her mood.

“Commander. Oura is running cold on trajectory. No active systems. Passive IR and visual only. We have been on this heading for six hours two minutes. No contacts detected. Perihelion passage remains nominal.”

“Fuel state.”

“Seventy-three percent. Transit budget intact. Reserve margin above threshold.”

“Any traffic in the passive record?”

“One thermal event logged at zero-three-forty-one. Bearing two-two-six, estimated range four hundred thousand kilometers. Signature consistent with a drive burn of approximately ninety seconds duration. Classification: probable Brasília Sphere registry based on plume profile. It occurred eleven minutes prior to detection. Contact has not reappeared.”

Mäkinen considered this. One burn, ninety seconds, then silent. Running ballistic now. Which meant either the contact had finished its maneuver and was coasting normally, or it had seen her and gone cold.

“Did we emit anything in the preceding window?”

“Negative. Oura has been dark since eighteen hundred yesterday.”

She wasn’t seen. Probably. The Brazilians were running their own approach to Mercury’s polar ice survey corridors. Competing claims, the usual bureaucratic theater. They filed papers. The Nordic-Hellenic Compact filed counter-papers. Meanwhile both sides sent scouts.

She was twenty-nine years old and this was her fourth Mercury rotation and it bored her.

“XO, I’m going active. Stand by to resume direct command.”

“Acknowledged. Passive Mode disengaged. Active Mode confirmed. XO standing by.”

The quality of the feed shifted — subtle but real, the way the difference between watching a river and standing in it is subtle but real. The substrate’s executive coherence fully engaged. She was, insofar as the term applied to a biological relay construct sealed in an acceleration-rated canister aboard a small warship nine hundred thousand kilometers from the planet Mercury, present.

“Helm. Adjust trajectory. I want to close on that contact’s last known bearing.”

“Commander.” The NAV function, integrated into the XO package on a scout this small, responded instantly. “Intercept course to bearing two-two-six will require a burn. Duration six seconds at two G. Emissions risk: detectable by advanced IR within six hundred thousand kilometers.”

“If they’re cold, they’re not looking.”

“Assessed probability of contact remaining cold: sixty-one percent.”

Sixty-one percent. Slightly better than a coin flip. Another lieutenant commander might have called that unacceptable odds. Another lieutenant commander had options she didn’t.

“Execute.”

The burn was six seconds. She felt the acceleration through the substrate as a dull pressure — the Bucket’s suspension handling most of it, the remainder translated through the biological tissue as a heaviness in the chest. At two G, unremarkable. The substrate’s heart rate climbed to eighty-four and came back down.

Then dark again. Ballistic. Coasting on the new vector.

“Burn complete. No detected emissions response from contact bearing.”

Sixty-one percent, vindicated.

She’d been right. She was usually right. She’d learned to stop finding this impressive.

“XO. I’m going to passive. Log my sync. Wake me if thermal signature recurs or if bearing changes.”

“Logged. Standing by. May I note, Commander — you have been active for twelve minutes.”

“I can do math, XO.”

“Noted.”

She pulled back the executive coherence. Not all the way — not the cocktail, not passive-passive, just the operational middle distance she’d learned to maintain. The substrate still registered. The feed still ran. But she was watching rather than commanding, the way you could sit in a room with people and follow the conversation without participating in it.

Mercury’s terminator was a hard line against the dark. The solar corona was ridiculous at this range, visible even through the passive optics with the filters stacked. You forgot, from 1 AU, how much of the sky the sun occupied when you were close.

She’d been on Earth twice since enlisting. Both times she’d found the gravity mildly oppressive and the population mildly exhausting and had been glad to return to vacuum.

Her mother had asked, at the last dinner before the second rotation, whether she was doing all right. Whether the remote command work was affecting her. Whether it was strange, not being on the ship in person.

She’d said no.

She hadn’t elaborated.

The honest answer was more complicated than she had the patience to explain to someone who’d spent their entire career inside a single planetary gravity well. The honest answer was that after thirty-something synchronizations you stopped being certain where the seam was. Not in a destabilizing way. In the way you stopped being certain which memories were from before your first sync and which were from after. 

The substrate had been alive for three years aboard three consecutive ships. It had experienced things her body on Luna hadn’t.  The brainwave analysis showed they remained coherent — the quarterly psych evaluation confirmed identity continuity.

She was, officially, fine.

She watched Mercury turn.

“XO.”

“Commander.”

“Log the Brasília contact as inconclusive. No hostile action. No identification. Probable survey traffic.”

“Logged.”

“I’ll be back at perihelion minus two hours.”

“Understood. Oura will maintain current trajectory and passive posture. Standing orders remain in effect.”

She pulled back the rest of the way. The feed dimmed. The sense of Mercury’s presence — that physical certainty of where things were in space — faded like a light going out in a room she was leaving.

The ceiling tiles of the pod suite on Shackleton Rim came back.

She unfastened the cervical array. Sat up. Checked the sync log on the medical panel.

Active: fourteen minutes. Substrate vitals: nominal. No adverse events.

She stood. Her body on Luna was stiff in the way it always was — she’d been motionless for seventeen minutes and her spine had opinions about that.

She went to get coffee.

The duty petty officer looked up when she came through the hatch.

“Everything okay out there, Commander?”

Mäkinen considered the question.

Nine hundred thousand kilometers away, her relay substrate sat sealed in an aluminum canister aboard a 5-tonne ship running silent on a polar approach to the innermost planet in the solar system, watching for Brasília survey ships that may or may not have seen her, alone in the most hostile thermal environment in the inner system, with eleven hours until perihelion.

“Quiet,” she said.

“I don't know if I'm going to hang up my boots this summer.”","Iago Aspas (Moaña (Pontevedra), 1987) was mobbed by fans on Thursday at the new Fútbol Emotion store in the Gran Vía Shopping Center in Vigo. There, he took part in a meeting with Celta fans alongside his teammate Hugo Sotelo and spoke to AS about the team's progress, his role in Claudio Giráldez's plans and, of course, a contract renewal that has the team's fans on tenterhooks.

Since we're in a football store, when was the last time you bought boots?

The truth is, it's been a few years, about 15 or 18. Thank God, since I joined the first team, I stopped buying them or asking my parents to buy them for me.

Speaking of boots, are you going to hang them up this summer?

I don't know. As you know, I haven't set myself a date. It will depend on how I feel. I have a very good relationship with Marco (Garcés). When I make a decision, I'll talk to him about it or we'll have a coffee. Whichever way I decide, I'll be eternally grateful.

In terms of football, you're handling 38 well, but what about physically? Are you feeling your age?

I'm handling it pretty well. It's true that football is more physical now than it was 8, 10, or 15 years ago. I'm feeling good and playing in almost every game, either as a starter in many of them or a little less from the bench in others. I'm very happy.

“Football is more physical now than it was 8, 10, or 15 years ago.”

Iago Aspas

Fer López has returned to Celta, a player with a similar profile to yours, and in the last two games you've had to come on in the final minutes. Do you willingly accept the role of substitute, or does it still make your blood boil when you're left out of the starting lineup?

With time, you come to accept it, but of course every player likes to play and feel involved. I know where I can help. The coach talks to me from time to time and explains how much I'm going to play, why he thinks it's better for me to start on the bench in this game... For example, on the day of the Lille game, Hugo Sotelo was sent off, and at the first break, he told me that when it was my turn, I would have to leave the field because we had to defend more as a low block. Every game is different, and Claudio really likes tactics. He thinks long and hard about his game plans.

Do you think it's possible that Fer López's loan will be extended beyond June 30?

Of course I'd like that as a Celtic fan. We know that Wolves paid money last summer, and it's not going to be a one-day thing, as Marco said.

Today you visit Espanyol. Why does Celta struggle so much against Manolo González's team?

Since Claudio arrived, three games and three defeats. We've been working all week to improve the things we didn't do well in the games against them. The squad's morale is very high and we're working hard to get back to winning ways.

Next week, the Europa League returns. How do you assess the tie against PAOK?

We know that there are no easy games in Europe, whether away or at home. We're facing an opponent we've already played at Balaídos, and they're going to sell themselves dearly on their home turf. It's a difficult scenario, but we'll try to get a favorable result to confirm it here in Vigo with a win.

If Celta goes through, they will face Aston Villa or Olympique Lyon in the round of 16. Which would you prefer?

First, we have to eliminate PAOK. After that, it's clear that they are two of the favorites, having finished first and second. Any opponent will be very difficult.

Is this Europa League more or less competitive than nine years ago when Celta reached the semifinals?

This year, the teams are more evenly matched. The level is very high, but there isn't as much difference between third and twelfth place, for example. Back then, there was Manchester United, but also Krasnodar, without wanting to disrespect any team. There was more difference between the teams back then. Now, the average level is very high, and every game is won by small details.

We started talking about boots and we'll end with them too. Who wears out a pair faster: you or your children?

I opened my eyes, and there I was—back in my room.

My nostrils flared as the air carried an unfamiliar scent—something subtle, like the lingering fragrance of naturally dried rose petals. It didn’t belong to anything I remembered from before.

I turned my gaze toward the lone window. The late afternoon sun filtered in, casting golden beams across the floor. Tiny dust particles floated within the light, suspended in mid-air like fragments of thought—scattered, drifting, unanchored.

I watched them, mesmerized by their slow, silent dance. Each movement seemed random, yet graceful, occasionally disturbed by a faint breath of air from the old, wheezing air conditioner. Its dull hum and steady vibrations filled the room, pressing against the silence like a steady pulse.

Was all this real? I wondered, the question lingering in my mind like the dust in the air.

I glanced down at my shoes—caked in brown mud, some patches still damp, others dry and cracked. Around me, scattered across the floor, were several rose petals. Dried, delicate, and fading, they lay there like quiet remnants of a long-forgotten memory.

Where had I been?

I sat quietly, staring into the stillness of the room, and wondered how I could activate the interface again—the one the Dark Resident had spoken about.

There must be a way to bring it back, I thought.

“Status screen,” I said aloud.

Nothing happened.

The silence that followed was almost mocking.

I tried again.

“Utilities.”

Still nothing.

“Head-up display.”

No response. No flicker. No activation. Nothing.

I looked around, feeling the sting of disappointment creeping in. But then, something caught my eye.

There, just a few feet in front of me, sat a softly glowing blue box.

It pulsed faintly, as if breathing.

Well, at least not everything was a dream, I thought, slowly standing and moving closer. This box—the box—is proof that something happened—something real.

I crouched next to it, watching the blue glow shift with each beat of silence.

Connecting with the box was a huge risk, a gamble with potentially devastating consequences. But I had already played my hand, and now there was no going back.

Now, I had to figure out what came next. 

I moved closer to the box and gently lifted it into my hands.

It felt surprisingly light—almost ethereal, as if it weren’t entirely bound to the physical world. A low, steady hum vibrated from within, like it was alive, like it was breathing.

Then I felt it.

A subtle pull—like the box was drawing me in, starting from where my hands touched its surface. I glanced down and saw a faint glow emerging from beneath my fingers, tracing their outlines in soft pulses of blue light.

Curious, I slowly lifted one hand. The box now rested in my lap, but the glow where my fingers had been didn’t fade. Instead, the light remained, and from my raised hand, thin streams of green energy arced back toward the box, as if the connection couldn’t be broken.

I returned my hand to its original position, and the energy strands merged effortlessly with the glowing outline.

Okay, I breathed, so this is real. I’m holding a strange alien object in my hands, and it’s interacting with me like it knows who I am.

As the realization settled over me, something shifted inside—my heartbeat slowed, my breath came easier. I was still overwhelmed, but no longer panicked.

The box—whatever it really was—had been created in higher dimensions. That much I could feel. I could sense it subtly altering its form, adapting.

As I relaxed, I noticed the object beginning to shrink.

Wait—what’s happening now?

It slowly reduced in size and became more compact. I stared at it, unsure of what to expect.

I can’t just walk around holding this thing, I thought. What would I even say to someone?

“Hey, what are you holding?”

“Oh, nothing. Just a weird alien box that gives me superpowers—but only if I keep holding it.”

Yeah, that would go over great. Maybe I could put it in a backpack now.

Or better yet, maybe it could disguise itself. Something simple. Like one of those AI health bands that no one ever notices.

Just then, I looked down again—and there it was.

Lo and behold, the box had changed.

No longer a glowing cube, it now resembled a sleek, luminous wristband, resting quietly in my lap, waiting.

I took a long breath and stared at the band now resting in my lap, glowing faintly.

Maybe this is how it works, I thought, slowly reaching for it.

Something about it pulled me in—gently, but insistently.

This object, whatever it truly was, had the ability to shape-shift. That much was obvious now. Maybe in ancient times it took the form of a bag or something people could carry easily. For me, it had first appeared as a suitcase, then transformed into a cube, and now... this.

A band.

A wearable band.

The moment I slipped it onto my wrist, something changed.

Instantly.

The first thing I noticed was that the band gripped my skin with an unnatural tightness—not painful, but unyielding. Like it had fused with me. I tried to pull it off, but it wouldn’t budge.

It clung to me like a second skin.

There’s no way to remove it without tearing off my flesh.

Panic fluttered in my chest. I immediately regretted putting it on, but it was too late.

Too late now, I thought grimly, trying again to peel it off. The material flexed but wouldn’t break or slip free.

After several failed attempts, I paused, panting, and stared at it.

What’s your purpose? I wondered. Why are you here?

The moment that thought passed through my mind, the world around me vanished.

I was no longer in my room.

I was floating in an endless, black void—weightless, silent.

And then, like a flood, images rushed at me.

Visions streamed past—some ancient, some modern. Civilizations rising and falling. Alien landscapes. Beings I couldn’t name.

It was like watching a universe’s worth of history being projected through my mind all at once.

What have I just stepped into?

""Are you the Dark Resident?"" I asked.

Suddenly, the flood of images froze.

Silence fell.

Then, I heard a voice—soft, sweet, and resonant. It echoed in my mind, not like sound, but like a thought spoken with perfect clarity. It carried a strange weight, as if it had always existed and always would.

""I am the Name Box's interface,"" the voice replied. ""The Dark Resident is trapped inside the box. His powers are orchestrated through it.""

""You mean... Can I use all his powers? Just like that?"" I asked, still trying to process everything.

""Incorrect,"" the voice said gently. ""You can only access the power of the alien’s name you have been assigned.""

The alien’s name?

""And how do I do that?"" I asked. ""How do I use those powers? I don’t even know what they are. Why should I use them? And what will they do for me?""

There was a pause, brief but deliberate.

""They will help,"" the voice said at last.

""Help?"" I echoed. ""Help with what?""

There was no immediate answer, only the hum of the void waiting.

“Would you like a tutorial?” the voice asked, still calm and clear in my mind.

“Yes, please—anything that can help,” I blurted, not even hesitating.

In an instant, my surroundings shifted. The dark void dissolved, and I was suddenly back in my room. But it wasn’t just my room anymore.

On either side of me, transparent panels floated in midair—head-up displays (HUDs), filled with shifting data, strange symbols, and glowing numbers.

This is insane...

I instinctively turned toward what looked like the primary interface, and as I did, it zoomed forward, centering itself in front of me like it had a mind of its own.

One section caught my attention:

LEVEL: Pre-Initiated

 (0)

“I’m a level zero?” I asked, surprised and more than a little disappointed.

“Yes,” the voice confirmed gently. “That’s correct. You are currently at level zero.”

“How can I be a zero? After everything I’ve seen. Everything I’ve felt?”

“After the tutorial,” the voice said, “you will gain access to the leveling system and the skill tree. Your training must begin before you can unlock more.”

“Okay... fine,” I muttered. “How do I start?”

As soon as I spoke, a new series of visuals appeared before me.

They were incredibly lifelike—more than just images. They were full 3D projections, or avatars, showing me exactly what to do.

I saw myself—or a version of myself—standing calmly, then suddenly darting forward, disappearing, and reappearing in a different location.

“Rha’il’s power: involved multi-channel, multi-phasing–a set of complex multi-faceted powers,” said the voice, almost as if it were reading from a list.

“One power assigned to your alien's name is a form of teleportation, allowing it to shift between locations with a slight crackling sound and a flash of light. The first step in learning this skill is to observe it. Look closely.”

I leaned in, eyes locked on the projection.

Teleportation... Can I do this?

I watched as the figure flickered, dissolved, and reappeared across the room.

No wires. No tech. Just sheer will.

Let’s see if I can keep up.

“It’s important for you to understand—this is a very dangerous skill,” said the voice.

“How can teleportation be dangerous?” I asked, frowning. “It sounds pretty straightforward.”

“Imagine this scenario,” the voice continued calmly. “You attempt to teleport... and accidentally materialize inside a wall.”

I paused.

Oh.

“You understand the problem now,” the voice added.

“Yes,” I muttered.

“So, learning anything can be challenging,” it said. “If you teleport into a solid object, your blood flow will immediately cease. Your body will merge with the structure, cutting off circulation to whatever organ is embedded in the material. The result is usually fatal.”

A chill ran through me as the realization hit.

So, this power could be dangerous.

“But,” the voice continued, “you must not be afraid. Like all things, mastery comes with time. Others before you have learned it. So can you.”

More scenarios played through my mind—visions of things going horribly wrong.

What if I miscalculate? What if I panic mid-jump? What if I do something incredibly stupid?

Not just the usual stupid, but the deadly kind.

I tried to convince myself I wasn't stupid, but the lie felt brittle and unconvincing. What if I unintentionally do something that is perceived as unintelligent in this specific scenario?

I swallowed hard.

This wasn’t a video game. There were no respawns—no second chances.

If I got it catastrophically wrong, my life would end before I had the chance to regret it.

“Focus, Kyle,” said the voice.

I snapped back to the present, shaken from my thoughts. My gaze shifted to the avatar projected in front of me.

I watched closely.

There I was, standing in the center of a large hall. One moment, I was in one place. Next, I was ten feet away instantaneously.

How...?

“Do you see how this can be done?” the voice asked.

“Okay... but how do I do it in here?” I asked.

“You imagine the place you want to go,” the voice explained. “Estimate the distance. It doesn’t have to be exact. Your power will assist you. Right now, you are in a sandbox.”

“A sandbox?” I echoed. “What’s that?”

“A sandbox is a controlled environment where you can safely execute the tutorial without the risk of injury or death.”

“Oh. That’s... a relief.”

“The real trouble,” the voice added, “comes when you’re in the actual world and try to use the powers recklessly.”

“Hey AI. Thanks for that advice,” I muttered. “I won’t forget how you helped me with it, assuming I survive, of course.”

“As if it matters to me?” the voice said sarcastically. 

“Hmmm. That’s oddly not comforting,” I said. “Well, I have a question,” I said.

“Ask away,” it replied.

“So... you’re an ancient device, right? Then how come you have AQDs—Artificial Quest Displays—like the ones found in modern video games?”

There was a pause, then the voice responded, “The interface to the system evolves. It adapts and transforms according to the world, the era, and the individual using it, especially what you have become accustomed to.”

So it’s not just alien—it’s personalized. It’s evolving with me.

That was both soothing and terrifying.

""So, tell me—where do I start?"" I asked, still trying to wrap my head around everything.

""Just do it,"" the voice replied, calm and unwavering. ""Just imagine where you want to go... and go. Right ahead.""

I hesitated; my brow furrowed.

""That's it? No countdown? No command phrase? No sparkly portal to jump into?""

""None of that is necessary,"" the voice said. ""Your mind is the trigger. Your will is the mechanism. Once you're able to complete this basic test, we’ll move on to the next stage of your training.""

Just imagine and go, I repeated to myself.

Easier said than done.

But if that’s all it takes—imagination and intent—then maybe I had more power than I thought.

I tried to move myself and teleport, but somehow, my mind couldn’t fully let go of the physical limitations I’d always known.

How do you trick your brain into accepting that you can do something your body has never done?

Every time I tried, doubt crept in.

The result? Less than impressive, to say the least.

Sometimes I moved a foot. Sometimes three. Occasionally, I even ended up a step backward.

It was frustrating. Inconsistent.

But then again, this was my first time.

For them, I reminded myself, the Nine—whoever or whatever they were—this might have been ordinary.

But for me?

This was all brand new.

“Kyle,” said the voice, calm but firm. “You also must understand the system.”

“The system?” I repeated. “What does that mean?”

“The system is how you progress through the levels—until you achieve balance.”

“And what does that mean? What does ‘balance’ even do? And what does level up mean in this context?”

There was a brief pause, as if the voice considered how best to explain.

“Okay,” it finally said. I understand this is all new to you, so let me walk you through it.”

The voice repeated, slowly and clearly, “You need to reach Level 1000 to achieve balance. That’s your goal.”

“And balance means...?” I prompted.

“You attain the full potential of Rha’il,” the voice answered.

“Wow,” I said, letting that sink in. “That must be something.”

“Yes. You’ve already seen a glimpse of what he’s capable of. But that was only a fraction of his true power. Only a sliver of what Rha’il can do… what you could eventually do.”

“Right,” I said, nodding slowly. “The tentacled guy—I remember him now. So, how do I level up?”

“You continue to practice,” the voice replied. “Each time you use your powers in the real world—every successful teleportation—your skill will increase incrementally. For each small teleport, your teleportation skill improves by one point.”

“Okay, I get that. But teleporting can’t be the only thing, right? What else goes into leveling?”

“Well,” the voice said with a hint of caution, “the early levels are relatively easy to progress through. After that, it becomes more complex. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.”

“Fair enough,” I said. “Tell me more.”

“First,” the voice instructed, “you must complete the tutorial. That’s your priority. Once it’s done, I’ll return.”

“Well, didn’t I already try?” I asked.

“Yes,” the voice replied. “But it’s barely started yet.”

“And what if I…” I began, but the voice was already fading, leaving the question hanging in the air.

What if I fail? What if I can’t do it?

But I already knew—there was no turning back.

It was just then that a loud, jarring noise snapped me out of the trance-like state.

I was back in my room, or at least it felt that way, though my mind was still drifting between layers of reality.

Someone was banging on the door.

The pounding echoed through the space, sharp and insistent, forcing me to pull away from the tutorial's lingering haze.

My focus shattered in an instant. But even as I turned toward the door, I could still see the faint silhouettes of the displays—flickering, ghostlike—slowly dissolving into the surrounding air.

Then, just like that, they vanished.

The room returned to its usual stillness, and I exhaled, steadying myself as I prepared to carry on with what now felt like a very ordinary day.

Or at least... I hoped it would be.

The banging continued, loud and relentless.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

“Okay, okay! I’m coming!” I called out, stumbling toward the door, still groggy from the fading echoes of the interface.

I opened it to find the hostel manager—standing there with a stern expression.

He looked me over for a moment before speaking.

“Hi,” I said cautiously.

“Hello,” he replied, repeating the greeting a bit too many times. “The police are here. They want to ask a few questions.”

“The police?” I blinked. “Why would that concern me?”

“It’s nothing serious,” he assured me with a small wave of his hand. “You just need to come downstairs and answer a few things. Standard procedure. Don’t worry.”

Easy for you to say, I thought.

“We’re just asking decent ones. I can see that,” he added, as if reading my face.

“Right...” I muttered.

I followed him downstairs, my mind racing.

Several people were already seated in the dining area, enjoying the free breakfast—bagels with cream cheese tinted an unusual green and steaming cups of coffee.

“You can grab some breakfast while you wait,” the manager said, gesturing toward the food counter.

“Thanks,” I replied, trying to act normal. I ordered a coffee and sat at a small table near the corner.

A girl stood beside me a moment later. She was probably in her early twenties, with curious eyes and an amiable smile.

“This is a nice place,” she said, glancing around. “Kid, what are you doing here all alone?”

I hesitated for a beat.

“I’m just here for…” I trailed off, unsure of how much to say—or who I could trust. “It’s a school thing. Sort of.”

“You know, I can tell when someone is lying. Kids. Seriously.”

I blushed. “No, I am not.”

“Hey, it’s okay,” she whispered. “It’s good that you don’t talk to strangers or tell them everything. That’s perfect.”

“You could’ve told me, though. Um... I mean, you don’t have to answer me. Right?” I said awkwardly, fumbling for the right words.

“And you are?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.

“I’m Julia,” she said, offering a small smile. “Um, I’m also here for school,” she added, making air quotes with her fingers. “To do the ‘school trip’ thing.”

“Really? You look a bit too old for school. Just sayin’”

She rolled her eyes and grinned, “Okay, jokes aside—I’m here for a university trip.”

“Oh? Where’s the university? Where are you from?” I asked.

“I’m from Canada. Toronto,” she replied. “Yes, all the way far away.” She laughed, clearly poking fun at herself.

“Okay, I’ll tell you,” I said, relaxing a little. “I’m from Orlando. Not that far, really. I’m here on... personal business.”

“How old are you?” she asked.

“Well... fourteen. Going to be fifteen soon,” I added quickly.

Her eyes widened. “And your parents let you come here all alone? No escort? No one to take care of you?”

“My parents...” I hesitated, then sighed. “They’re no longer with me.”

“I’m so sorry,” Julia said softly, her expression shifting, suddenly serious.

“Hmmm.”

“So, you want to grab a seat for breakfast?”

We sat down at a table as I looked around.

“What’s up with the police asking things?” she asked.

“I heard the enforcers were around nowadays. Why would you even need the police? Do you have enforcers in Toronto?”

“Yes. They are everywhere. It’s almost as if they are the universal police. They come out of nowhere. In our town, they came out of nowhere.”

“Same here.”

“Does anybody even know where the Enforcers come from?” I asked, my voice low, almost hesitant.

Julia shook her head slightly. “Not really,” she said. “I remember—I was 21 when it happened. Seven years ago. On my birthday, actually.”

She paused for a moment, lost in thought. “That was the first time we saw them. The Enforcers.”

“They’re strange,” I said. “People, creatures... whatever they are.”

“Yes, very,” she agreed. “They talk little. They just come in, grab someone, kill someone, crush something... like they have their own rules.”

“None of it makes sense,” I said. “They don’t seem to follow any government. They don’t take orders. They just... show up and do whatever they want.”

“That’s it,” she nodded. “You nailed it.”

I watched her face, the slight shift in her expression. “You don’t seem comfortable talking about them,” I said carefully.

“Yeah, well... would you be?” she replied with a dry smile.

“Have you ever had an encounter with them?” I asked. “I mean—seen one? Up close?”

“Encounter?” she repeated. “Like... fighting them?” She gave a half-laugh. 

“Obviously, you wouldn’t survive that.”

“Yeah, obviously,” she said, managing a faint grin.

“So… just seeing them, then?”

She nodded slowly. “They come and go in seconds. Blink and they’re gone. That’s how it is back home, at least.”

“Yeah,” I said, leaning back. “Same here.”

We sat silently for a moment, the weight of the topic settling in around us like fog.

Some things are better left unspoken.

“I heard your place is cold.”

“Yeah, when I came here, I didn’t even pack shorts. I forgot what actual sun feels like.”

I looked at her closely. Julia had shoulder-length hair and a light presence about her. She looked a little older, maybe in her early twenties, but there was something foreign in her features—a distinct accent in her tone, a unique softness in the way she carried herself.

I noticed her accent wasn’t thick, but she had that kind of international ease, like someone used to a city where a dozen languages meet on one block.

She really is from Canada, I thought.

Though… something about her didn’t feel entirely right.

Maybe I’m just overthinking again, I told myself. I should probably just focus on what I’ve been through... and let the rest come as it will.

It was then that the uniformed man called me over.

“Guess, we’ll meet again.”

“I’ll be around,” she added after a moment. “If you ever want to talk. Or need advice. Or just someone to hang out with.”

“Thanks, and Julia.”

“Yes?” she said, turning slightly toward me.

“You can come to me too if you need help,” I offered.

She chuckled. “You’re funny. I like that in kids.”

\*\*\*

“Kyle Bennett,” said the policeman, scanning the clipboard in his hand.

“That would be me… right?” I replied, my voice a little more uncertain than I wanted it to be.

I looked around the manager’s office, where I had been called in. It was cramped, overly air-conditioned, and filled with the stale scent of old coffee. I noticed I was one of the few guests being questioned.

What’s going on? Why me?

“So, what’s a 14-year-old doing all alone in Miami?” the officer asked, leaning casually against the desk.

“Is there a problem, officer?” I asked cautiously. “I’m just here for a brief trip. I’ve had a lot on my mind and needed a break.”

“Yeah, Miami’s good for that,” he said with a small smile. “How long are you planning to stay?”

“I’d say about a month. Maybe less… maybe more. I didn’t know there were any restrictions for traveling between state cities. Is there one?”

“There isn’t,” he said, nodding. “But we’re just checking in. There’s been some... unusual activity in the area.”

“Unusual activity?” I echoed.

“Yeah,” he said, lowering his voice slightly. “There have been reports of some weird things happening around town. And a few of those reports involve teenagers—ones that match your age range.”

I blinked. “That’s got nothing to do with me, obviously.”

“Obviously,” he repeated, his tone neutral.

There was a pause. Then I added, “If there’s anything going on, officer, I’ll be sure to let you know. Seriously.”

“Appreciate that,” he said, giving me a polite nod. “We just want to make sure everyone’s safe. That includes you too, Kyle.”

I nodded, though my stomach had started to twist.

Weird things involving teenagers... great. Just what I needed.

“On a different note, I would like you to get in touch with me if you are planning on leaving town.”

“But I am not from around here. Am I a suspect?”

“Let’s just say we have an interest in people with your profile.”

That didn’t look good. Not good at all.

1r3hlf3,https://youtu.be/EIkssXAVgPo,3 Very Scary TRUE Uber Ride Horror Stories,"# ""DETOUR"":

I had just finished a long day of exploring the city on my own. My feet were sore from all the walking around, and the sun was setting low, making the streets seem a little bare. It felt like a quiet nudge that it was time to make my way back to where I was staying. I opened my application and requested a ride. The car arrived pretty quickly. The driver rolled down his window and checked my name. ""Hop in,"" he said with a nod.

I got in the back of the car and buckled in. He glanced in the mirror and smiled as he saw me. ""First time here?"" he asked as he pulled the car away from the curb.

""Yeah,"" I said, keeping my answer brief. I was not in the mood for much conversation at the time.

""Hm. You look like someone who could definitely use a little fun. Got a boyfriend waiting for you at home?"" He chuckled softly at that.

The question caught me off guard, and I adjusted my position. ""Um, no,"" I replied, looking out the window at the passing buildings.

""Good,"" he said, his tone a little too enthusiastic. ""I can be your boyfriend for tonight. I can show you some of the real places to go in this city, some of the ones that tourists don't even know about.""

Thoughts swirled in my mind. I didn't want to appear to be impolite or get him mad—after all, he was the driver. ""Oh, that's alright. I just need to get to my hotel. It's been a long day.""

""Come on,"" he urged, turning the steering wheel slightly more sharply than necessary. ""It won't take long. You'll love it. Trust me.""

I hesitated. On the app, it said we were still on route. ""Alright, but just quick,"" I said, trying to sound as casual as ever. But inside, I was thinking about everything. Why did I agree to go with him? I should have said no right off the bat.

His grin looked even wider in the mirror. ""That's the spirit. You'll thank me later.""

We drove along familiar streets, but then the roads changed. We passed fewer buildings, heading towards a bridge I had never seen before. ""Where are we going?"" I asked, my voice steady, though my hands tightened around my bag.

“Just a nice viewpoint,” he said. “Best spot in the area. Relax.”

The car hummed across the water. The city lights twinkled behind us. We stopped at an isolated area that offered a view of the bay. The view was nice but out of the way. There were no other cars around. He parked the car. He turned off the engine. ""Come up front,"" he said. ""Better view from here.""

I stayed put. ""I'm good back here. We should head back now.""

He chuckled, a low sound that sent shivers running over my skin. “Don’t be shy. Let’s take our picture together. To remember the night.”

Prior to giving a response, he reached back and took the phone from my hand. ""Hey!"" I exclaimed.

He bent down between the two seats to take a selfie of the two of us. “See? Fun already,” he said, his breath warm against my cheek.

“Give that back,” I said firmly, reaching for it.

He kept it out of reach and continued to smile. “Come to the front first.""

My pulse quickened. Something was off. This situation was not right. The location was not populated, was dark. I unbuckled and opened the door, stepping out into the space. ""I need my phone. Now.""

He also got out, around the car. ""Ok, ok. But let's enjoy the view for a minute.""

I stepped back. ""No. Take me back to my hotel.""

He moved closer to me. ""You're being silly. We're having a good time.""

And then He reached for me, grabbed my arm, and pulling me towards him. His other hand was on my face, trying to get me to kiss him. His fingers touched my chest, and everything suddenly made sense—this was not a tour, this was dangerous.

Panic gripped me. ""Stop!"" I shouted, pushing him back hard with both hands. He stepped back, looking taken aback.

""What? Come on—""

""No!"" I shouted, still louder. ""Take me back, right now! This is not okay!""

He looked at me, his smile melting into an even colder stare. ""Fine. Get in.""

However, I didn't move. ""Unlock the car. I'm getting my stuff.""

He pressed the key fob, and I grabbed my bag. ""Drive me back,"" I said, trying to keep distance between us. My tone was shaking but strong.

He muttered something under his breath and got in. I slid into the back, the door open until he started the engine. ""Go,"" I said.

The trip back was silent, tense. I observed every turn, my finger resting on the emergency button of my phone. He flicked a few glances in my direction through the rearview mirror but remained silent. My thoughts ran with a litany of possibilities. What if he does not take me back? What if he stops somewhere else? Time ticked by, with each minute feeling longer.

Finally, we arrived at my hotel. He pulled up next to it without a word. I immediately opened the door and jumped out quickly. I said, ""Don't ever contact me.""

He drove off slow, and I stood there, staring until I could no longer see his taillights. I was shaky as I walked into the house. Locking my door, I sat down on my bed, trying to catch my breath. What had just happened? It all flooded back: the questions, the drive somewhere, the grabbing. It could have been so much worse.

The next day, I opened the app to see that the ride was canceled in the middle, just as if it had never taken place to begin with. I felt sick to my stomach. Who was this guy? How many people had he done this to? While I did not report the incident immediately, I wondered if it was somehow my fault for consenting to the detour. However, the fear did not go away in a few days. I shared the incident with a friend, and they encouraged me to come forward.

Turns out, he had been removed from the platform for reasons, though, unfortunately, I never got the particulars of that conversation. Now, every time I'm considering whether to call a ride, that knot forms in my gut, rechecking the license plate, the face of the driver, sitting in the back, ready to exit when necessary. That night changed my perspective on life, this simple pick-me-up becoming a nightmare that I barely escaped.

It all began like any normal conversation. However, the way he was pushing, his isolation, and then moving suddenly—it all added up slowly until everything hit me at once. I was lucky that pushing him away worked. Not everybody is that fortunate.





# ""THE SECOND CAR"":

I had just finished a night out with my friends at a bar. It had been a long night, and I was feeling a bit dizzy from the drinks that night, so I got my phone and hailed a ride home through my app. The driver, a man by the name of Alex, nodded as I got into the back of the car. ""Evening,"" he said, his tone unenthusiastic.

Everything seemed normal at first: no people on the streets, just the hum of the engine, and the streetlamps zipping by. But then, my gut started churning. You see, earlier that day, I had eaten a bad meal, and when mixed with my drinking, well, this was no picnic. ""Pull over, please,"" I muttered, clinging to my mouth.



He glanced in the rearview mirror, furrowing his brow. ""What, no, we're almost there.""



But it was no use, and I vomited a little on the floor mat.

Alex slammed on the brakes, and the car came to an abrupt stop. ""Are you kidding me?"" he shouted, spinning around in his seat. His face turned red, veins popping out on his forehead. ""This is the second time this week! Get out! Get out now!"" I attempted to apologize, wiping my mouth with my sleeve. ""I'm sorry. It was an accident. Please, take me home."" But he was beyond consolation. He turned around, grasping my arm hard, and yanked the door open. ""Out! I don't care. Walk the rest of the way.""

I tripped on the sidewalk and stumbled. That's when I noticed that my phone and my purse were still buckled in at the back. ""Wait, my stuff!"" I shouted, but he continued speeding away with screeching tires. I glanced around. This was not where I lived. This was some rundown place with empty lots, a closed gas station, and a flickering light from an old building. But there was no sign of any people. My pulse quickened. How am I going to get home? No phone to call anyone.

I stood there for what felt like forever, hugging myself and trying to think. And then I heard footsteps. There were two people coming from the shadows. A man and a woman. The man was wearing a hoodie and the woman had short hair and a jacket. ""You okay?"" the woman asked, her voice curious but soft. ""Looks like you need help?""

I nodded, grateful to see someone. ""My ride kicked me out. I left my phone in the car. Could I get a lift home? I'll pay you later."" The man smiled. ""Ah, sure, no worries. Our car is over there. We can give you a lift."" The woman nodded. ""Yes, it is not safe to be alone on the street.""

Still, I hesitated for a second, but what choice did I have? So, I followed them to a beat-up black car parked around the corner. The man opened the back door of the car for me. ""Hop in,"" he said. As soon as I settled into the back seat, the woman got in the front passenger seat, and the man started driving the car. ""What's your address?"" he said. I gave him my address, and he started the engine. At first, it was okay. The woman turned around and started talking to me. ""Rough night, huh? That driver sounds like a jerk.""

""Yeah,"" I replied, attempting to laugh. ""Thanks for your help."" But as we drove, I noticed that we were headed in the wrong direction. The roads were becoming progressively narrower and more unknown. ""This is not the way to my house,"" I said, sitting up straight. The man looked in the rearview mirror. ""Shortcut. I told you, quicker that way."" The woman smiled again, but this time her smile appeared artificial. I had knots in my stomach, but they were not from being nauseous.

The car stopped in front of an apartment complex that looked deserted. The windows were boarded up on some floors. ""Where are we?"" I asked, my voice trembling. ""I just need to grab something. Go inside for a second."" I shook my head. ""No, take me home."" But he turned off the car and got out, coming to the passenger side to let me out. The woman remained seated in the car, staring. ""Come on,"" he said, changing to a harsher tone. He touched my wrist. ""Do not make this harder than it is.""

Panic built up inside me. I tried to struggle free, but he was too strong. ""Let go!"" I yelled. Finally, the woman said, ""Do what he's telling you to do. It will be over soon."" That gave me a chill. He began to drag me towards the building. His grip was like a vice. We went up creaky stairs to a door on the second floor. In the room, it was dark. There was only a lamp to light it. There was trash on the floor. There was a mattress in the corner. There was no furniture. ""Sit down,"" he said to me. He pushed me down onto the mattress.

I backed up to the wall as much as I could. “What do you want? Please, just let me go.” He shut the door before turning to me, pulling out a small knife from his pocket with the blade shining under the light. “We are going to have some fun first. You should not have gotten in the car if you did not want this.” The woman was standing at the door, crossing her arms as if she was guarding me. “Scream if you want,” she said. “Nobody will hear anything here.”

My mind raced. I couldn’t fight him. He was too big, and he had the knife. But I had to do something. He moved closer to me with the knife, reaching for my shirt. “Don’t even think about moving,” he growled. I waited until the moment he was right over me, then kicked as hard as I could, the full force of my foot connecting solidly with his knee. He grunted in shock and stumbled backward, the knife going out of his hands. “You little—” he began, but I stood up, grabbing the lamp, and swung it as hard as I could against his head. It cracked loudly, and he went down to the side.

The woman lunged at me. ""Stop!"" she exclaimed. I sidestepped her and headed for the door, but it was locked. She pulled my hair, trying to stop me from running away. I felt a stinging sensation, but I elbowed her in return. She gasped, still holding my hair, and I managed to free myself by fumbling with the lock that my wet hands were struggling with, but I managed to open it and ran out, slamming the door behind me.

I ran down the stairs with shaking legs, bursting out into the night. The man yelled at me from the stairs, shouting, “Get back here!” Footsteps followed me. I avoided looking back. I sprinted across the street and took cover behind a dumpster in the alleyway. Heavy breathing filled my ears as I panted for breath. They were outside and yelling something in my direction; how did they know my name? Probably because of our earlier conversation. The man muttered, “Where is she?” The woman answered, “Forget it, let's go; someone might call the cops.”

I crouched in the darkness until the voices went away and the car drove off with its engine roaring. I was sobbing in tears, but alive. Eventually, I came out and went to the school, which was nearby. It was relatively early in the morning when I arrived, and a janitor was opening the school. ""Help,"" I whispered, falling at the doorway. ""What happened?""

""They came quick. I gave them a statement. Told them about the car and the people.” They said the driver who left me like that would also be charged, for abandoning me like he did. I was looked at by a doctor. I had bruises and cuts but no broken bones. I was picked up by my friends and went home.""

That night, everything changed. Now, I make sure that I double-check all rides, share locations, carry pepper spray, and so on. But there are times when I’m alone, and I hear those footsteps in my head, see that knife. I managed to escape, fear never truly escaped me.





# ""TOO PERSONAL"":

I currently work in the city, and I get there by using Uber. It is very easy. I only have to touch my app, and then I’m good to go. However, this particular drive changed everything for me.

I stood on the side of the sidewalk after the long shift, phone in hand, and waited for the tiny vehicle icon on the map to get closer. Finally, when the silver sedan-like vehicle approached, I made sure it had the matching plates, got in the back, and fastened the seatbelt. The guy was dressed like the typical male in his mid-thirties, a bit on the heavier side, round face, and a smile that showed way too many teeth for comfort. ""Hi there,"" he said, looking back over his shoulder, ""Going to Elm Street, right?""

""Yes, that's me,"" I replied, settling in. I picked up my phone and intended to scroll through the various messages.

As we set off, he went on with the smile. “You look familiar. Have I picked you up before?”

I shrugged. ""Maybe. I take a lot of rides.""

He nodded, glancing back at his reflection. ""Yeah, I remember that now. You used to work at that coffee shop downtown, didn't you? What made you quit?""

I stopped, my thumb frozen on the screen. But how did he know about the coffee shop? This was years ago when I was new to the job. I don’t talk about old jobs with people like this guy. “Um, I don’t think so,” I said, attempting to be cool.

""No, it's you,"" he repeated, chuckling as if it were no big deal. ""From that little town up north, yeah? You went to Lincoln High, graduated, and then got a degree in art history at the state college. Good choice.""

My mouth went dry. These were facts; they were truth; and I had never told anyone like that in front of a stranger driving a car, nor ever. I shifted my position; I kept my eyes fixed on the door handle of the car. ""How did you know?""

""Oh, yes, we talked about that last time,"" he said with a casual wave of his hand. ""You've got two little sisters, don't you? And you're single, though? Yeah, surprising for a girl like you.""

The car suddenly looked small. My fingers gripped my phone more tightly. Family. Relationship status. Never came up. ""I don't remember talking about that,"" I said, my voice softer than I meant it to be.

Again, he laughed, with the same expression staring back at him from the mirror. “Come on, don't be shy. I pick up a lot of people, but you're one of the stand-out ones. What was your roommate's name again—the guy. Were you and he close?""

It was a blow. My roommate was a friend, nothing more. But how does this person know he even existed? He looked in his rearview window to make sure of his reflection. His eyes lingered a second too long in mine for a person driving a car. ""Please, just look at the road,"" I muttered.

""Sure, sure,"" he said; but this did not stop him from talking. ""You like to go out to that bar on Main Street, right? Yeah, the one with the music? I bet you have a real good time there.""

Every word made my skin got cold. This was not normal. Drivers were supposed to ask about things like traffic or their music, not people's life stories. And he knew too much. How was he doing it? Had he researched me or followed me or something? The buildings were going by at a slower pace than normal, as if the ride was slowing down on purpose.

‘Tell me more about your art degree.’ He went on to ask. ‘You paint or something? I'd love to see your work.’

“I don’t want to talk,” I said resolutely, as my hands trembled a little while I invoked the ruse of texting. Who do I even text? Should I text a friend? That app had a safety button, what if he saw?

He said nothing for a block, and then: ""Your name is pretty. It suits you. You're beautiful, you know that? Smart too. My favorite passenger.""

I didn’t reply to that. The compliment had felt awkward on me, like a trap. We were passing by my residence, but now I did not want him to know where I lived. What if he came back?

Naturally, as we were approaching my street, I said, ""You know, you can drop me off at the end of the street near the blue door."" This was my landlord's doorway, not mine.

He slowed his vehicle, and it came right up to my door, though. But how was this accomplished? I hadn't given him the number. ""No need,"" he said. ""I know which one is yours. Don't want you walking far.""

The doors were still locked. I half-expected this and grabbed the handle again. Once, twice. Nothing. He moved in his seat, turning to face me fully, that he smiled even larger. ""This has been our longest ride together. Have a good night. Hope I get to see you again soon.""

Click. The lock cracked open. I grabbed my bag and ran out. I did not look back until I heard the engine of his car start. He was driving out slow, looking at me in the side mirror of his car.

Inside my apartment, I closed the door, stood against it, and breathed hard. That man knew things he shouldn't know. I immediately went into the Uber app and reported him, going into detail, including the questions he posed to the passengers. They told me they would investigate the matter and ensure that I do not get his service again.

And so for weeks, I took the bus. Crowded. Slow. Safe. I never saw him again, but sometimes I wonder if he's out there, picking up another woman, smiling at her just that same way. Remembering too much.",1,1770963207.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

We spend so much time polishing our messaging, perfecting our positioning…and then we strip out anything that makes us sound like actual humans talking to other actual humans.

The biggest shift I’ve seen in what actually works isn’t a new tool or tactic. It’s just showing up as people.

Let your team’s faces be visible. Let your CEO sound like a real person, not a press release. Share the messy middle parts, not just the polished wins.

The companies I respect most don’t feel like “brands” , they feel like groups of people I’d want to grab a coffee with.

And yeah, this goes against everything we were taught about “professional” B2B marketing. But buyers are tired. They’re tired of generic LinkedIn posts, tired of webinars that are nothing but just sales pitches, tired of websites that all say the same thing.

What cuts through? A founder doing a real product walkthrough. A CS person sharing what actually annoys them about the industry. A marketer admitting what didn’t work.

1r3hikz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1r3hikz/declared_dead_by_my_husband_does_anyone_have_free/,Declared Dead by My Husband - does anyone have free link?,"Madeline Turner had committed suicide by jumping from a building.
On the breaking news broadcast, she stood on the edge of a skyscraper, arms outstretched, and fell from the twenty-fifth floor.
An hour later, her death certificate shot to the top of Twitter's top of trending topics.
Two hours after that, her husband, Elwood Webster, announced publicly that the HarbourVision Project—something he had spent two years planning—would now be handed over to Valerie Cullen.
Three hours later, every trace of Madeline's existence vanished from the world.
But she wasn't dead.
She hadn't jumped at all.
She stared at the screen in disbelief, her hands shaking, then turned slowly toward Elwood. Rage burned so fiercely in her eyes that it nearly consumed her.
This had all been orchestrated by her husband. And the reason was absurd. 
All because she had reported her own student, Valerie, for plagiarism.
""Elwood, plagiarism is disgraceful!"" she'd told him. ""What Valerie did could ruin someone else's future!
""As her advisor, reporting her was my responsibility.""
Valerie curled up in Elwood's arms with tears in her eyes. She lifted her head, looking at Madeline with a mix of grievance and concealed arrogance.
""I didn't plagiarize,"" she said. ""It was just inspiration. Ms. Turner, I know you don't like me, but you can't just...""
She delicately dabbed at the corner of her eye with slender, pale fingers. ""If it weren't for Eddie helping me clear my name, I'd never be able to hold my head up again.""
Elwood gently stroked her hair, then turned an icy gaze on Madeline.
""Madeline, you nearly destroyed Vale's reputation. How can you be so heartless? Now it's your turn to taste the agony of social death.""
As he spoke, he pulled out his phone and sent a message to the attending physician of Madeline's mother, Evelyn Turner.
""Madeline has passed away. Postpone Evelyn's transplant surgery.""
The doctor replied almost instantly with a frantic voice message: ""But the patient doesn't have much time left!""
Elwood's lips curved into a calm, ruthless smile. ""I trust your abilities. I'll find another match in fifteen days.""
He set the phone down. ""That's the price you pay for bullying Vale.""
Standing above her like a judge passing sentence, he pulled Valerie into his arms.
""This punishment will last two weeks. Make sure you learn something from that.""
Standing above her like a judge passing sentence, he pulled Valerie into his arms.
She collapsed to the floor, struggling for breath.
Only after they left did she manage to stand, her body moving on instinct alone.
Her phone buzzed nonstop—messages, posts, tributes mourning the loss of a brilliant scientific prodigy.
She frantically tried to post explanations, to tell the world she was alive. But every comment was instantly buried by the trolls Elwood had hired.
She stared at the screen until her vision blurred with tears of bitter regret.
Just hearing Elwood's name now sent storms raging through her heart.
Three years ago, she'd arrived in Washington from New York.
Fresh off the plane, she'd spotted Elwood in a heated argument with a group of people.
Out of idle curiosity, she'd lingered to watch. Later, she learned that his research had been stolen. He was surrounded, outnumbered, and clearly losing ground.
When everyone thought the argument was over, she spoke. 
""There's something wrong with your figures,"" she said clearly. ""The deviation is massive.
""If you base your research on that, you'll lose everything.""
Everyone turned to stare at her in shock.
That was the day Elwood met Madeline.
And that day, he won the argument decisively.
Later, they crossed paths again in the lab. Because of the airport incident, Elwood went out of his way to look after her. 
When she struggled to adjust to the new city, he traveled across states to find the right doctors.
When her experiments failed, he stayed up all night helping her fix them.
When her parents were injured in a car accident, and the surgery costs 80 thousand dollars, he emptied his savings without hesitation.
At work, he was her closest collaborator; in life, he cared for her; in love, he was gentle, patient, and devoted.
During a patent award ceremony, he confessed to her in front of everyone.
""Ms. Turner,"" he said softly, ""would you let me be the strongest support in your life?""
They became the ""Golden Couple"" of Washington soon after—the brilliant scientist lovers everyone envied.
Until Valerie became her student.
Elwood's heart, once wholly hers, slowly drifted toward Valerie.
When Valerie pouted and asked for help, he'd drop everything—drop Madeline—to rush to her side.
When Valerie stood in the rain, he gave her Madeline's only umbrella.
When Valerie deliberately falsified data, ruining half a month of Madeline's work, he covered for her.
This time, Valerie—out of her depth—had outright stolen another team member's results. Madeline exposed her on the spot and expelled her from the program.
In return, Elwood erased her from the world.
He wiped her social media accounts, severed every lifeline.
Now, all she wanted was to reach the hospital—to be with her mother.

---
At the hospital, Madeline screamed herself hoarse at the attending physician. ""It's me—Madeline! Please, believe me!""
The doctor kept Elwood on the line while subtly signaling security.
As Madeline teetered on the edge of breaking, the doctor spoke coldly. ""Mr. Webster says his wife, Ms. Turner, passed away this afternoon. Due to her work, she made powerful enemies. Some might target her mother for revenge. I knew plastic surgery was advanced these days, but I didn't expect an impostor to show up so quickly.""
He waved to the guards. ""Get her out of here.""
Madeline's eyes burned bloodshot, a whirlwind of helplessness and hatred churning inside her.
""I'm Madeline!"" she roared. ""Please—just let me see my mother!""
Her voice cracked as sobs tore through her. ""Even if it's just from the doorway... please.""
The doctor refused without hesitation.
Just then, a nurse rushed out of the room. ""The patient is in acute renal failure. She needs surgery now!""
Madeline scrambled up from the floor. ""I'm her daughter! I was a perfect match!"" 
She looked at the doctor with the last ember of hope.
But then, a voice crackled from the doctor's phone. It was Elwood. The call was still active.
""She's not. My wife jumped to her death at four o'clock this afternoon.""
Then, the call ended with a click.
Those words extinguished her final spark. She stared blankly at the bustling ward, despair swallowing her whole.
Twenty minutes later, the doctor recorded Evelyn Turner's time of death.
Only then did he allow Madeline inside. ""Convincing act.""
Seeing her mother lying still and lifeless on the bed, Madeline finally shattered. 
She fell to her knees and wailed, grief pouring out in uncontrollable waves.
Because she had been declared dead, she wasn't even allowed to claim her mother's body.
She tried calling Elwood again and again, but the calls never went through.
Madeline sat numb in the hospital corridor, drowned in the indifferent noise around her.
This time, she was truly done with Elwood.
But before she walked away, they would pay.

Chapter 2
Even though Madeline had been sentenced to social death, there was one place that would never forget her.
Three years ago, the Apex Pioneers Team had offered her a job.
She'd turned it down without a second thought—after all, their research base was in the Arctic.
The team leader had sighed helplessly, yet still handed her an invitation.
""Keep this,"" he had said. ""The moment you decide to come, just call us. We'll have someone pick you up within fifteen days.""
Standing in a phone booth, Madeline dialed the number without hesitation.
""I accept your invitation.""
When the call ended, she felt strangely numb, as if her heart had already shut itself down.
Then, across the street, the massive screen on the building flickered to life with an interview of Elwood.
""I'm heartbroken over my wife's sudden passing,"" he said, his voice heavy with sorrow. ""But it was wrong of her to claim someone else's work as her own.""
When he spoke, his eyes glistened with feigned helplessness.
""Maddy has paid the ultimate price. I hope everyone can respect the dead and let her rest in peace.""
Madeline felt as if she'd been plunged into a frozen abyss, chills racing through her veins.
She stared at the man on the screen—the hypocrite she'd once loved—and a desolate ache bloomed in her heart.
She knew he favored Valerie, but she never imagined his devotion reached such heights—that he would systematically murder Madeline's reputation and distort the truth just to provide Valerie with a clean slate.
And in this twisted ""atonement"" of his, her beloved mother had lost her life.
Back home, Elwood regarded her with a stony expression.
After a long silence, he spoke as if the thought had just occurred to him. ""I had to say it that way. Otherwise, no one would believe it. Don't worry—in two weeks, I'll clear your name.""
Madeline's gaze turned glacial. Without a word, she snatched the heavy glass ashtray from the coffee table and hurled it at him with all her strength.
""Elwood!"" she snarled through gritted teeth.
He stared at her in disbelief. The gentle, considerate Madeline he'd known would never act so impulsively. But then understanding dawned.
He glanced down at Valerie nestled in his arms, a faint, wicked smile curling his lips. The trickle of blood at his temple only made him look more dangerously alluring.
""I'll clear it up,"" he soothed, as if calming a pet. ""Just be patient.""
With that, he leisurely wiped the blood away.
In that moment, an overwhelming sense of powerlessness flooded Madeline's entire body.
They weren't just arguing; they were speaking different languages.
Elwood cared only about outcomes, but Madeline cared about how he treated her.
She forced a bitter, jagged laugh. 
As she turned to head upstairs, Elwood's voice stopped her. ""Vale's craving your smoked ribs. Everything's prepped in the kitchen—would you mind?""
He tenderly tucked a stray lock of Valerie's hair behind her ear.
Valerie pouted sweetly. ""Maddy, they have to be freshly chopped for the best flavor. Please put some effort into it, okay?""
She looked innocent as a lamb, but Madeline caught the calculating gleam, the mockery in her eyes.
Valerie knew full well about her severe tenosynovitis—how any strain sent agonizing pain shooting through her wrist.
Elwood had once scoured the city for specialists to cure it.
""No,"" Madeline said flatly. ""We have a chef for that. And besides, why should I cook just because you feel like eating?
Elwood's eyes glinted with amusement.
After a beat, he stepped closer and pressed a cold, fleeting kiss to her forehead. ""There. Happy now? Go on—easy on the chili.""
He let out a derisive chuckle, seemingly having ""forgotten"" the very existence of her medical condition.
His arrogant dismissal made bile rise in her throat. Her battered heart went numb.
Yes—they couldn't understand each other anymore.
As she stood there dazed, Elwood suddenly grabbed her wrist.
""Don't push your luck,"" he warned icily. ""You know what I'm capable of.""
In a daze, she nodded.
She just had to hold out until the research team came for her.
That was the only thing she cared about now.
Turning away, she murmured almost to herself, ""Anyway... you can only keep me trapped for two weeks.""

Chapter 3
Elwood's brow furrowed slightly.
He caught Madeline's hand, confusion flickering in his eyes. ""What did you say?""
Madeline shook her head. ""Nothing.""
The heavy cleaver made her wrist tremble with every chop. She clenched the handle of the knife, enduring the pain as she chopped weakly.
Suddenly, the knife slipped from her grasp. A searing jolt shot through her wrist.
She crumpled to the floor, clutching her arm as agony twisted her features.
Hearing the commotion, Elwood hurried into the kitchen. The ribs were scattered on the floor, and Madeline huddled on the tiles, trembling.
He knelt beside her, gently taking her hand. ""Tenosynovitis acting up again? Come on, I'll take you to the hospital."" 
He scooped her into his arms.
Valerie stared at the mess on the floor, her expression turning pitiful.
Seeing Elwood's concern, she couldn't resist stirring the pot. ""Is Maddy doing this because she doesn't want to cook for me? Is tenosynovitis really that bad?""
She sighed dramatically. ""Fine. Forget the ribs. It's not a big deal if I go hungry. You two just go.""
The arms around Madeline's waist tightened, then abruptly let go. Elwood dropped her back onto the floor.
He let out a short, harsh laugh as he grabbed her injured hand. 
When she winced, he hissed, ""So you are faking it? You're quite the actress.""
He squeezed harder, tears springing to her eyes from the pain. ""Elwood!""
His gaze darkened, voice rough. ""Madeline, finish the ribs. No more little tricks.""
He picked up the fallen cleaver and pressed it back into her shaking hand.
Ignoring the violent trembling of her fingers, he wrapped an arm around Valerie and left the kitchen without another glance.
Cooking that meal was torture. Steam filled the air as tears glistened in Madeline's eyes, her thoughts a tangled storm.
She remembered the old Elwood—the one who took her pain seriously, who shouldered all her work during flare-ups, who even learned massage techniques just to ease her discomfort.
As she clamped the lid on the pot, those memories dissolved like smoke.
She finally accepted that Elwood was gone forever.
By the time the food hit the table, exhaustion and pain had drained the color from her face; her hands shook uncontrollably.
Elwood noticed—his eyes flickered with something almost like regret—but the moment passed in a blink.
He set down his fork. ""Eat something.""
In a faint voice, Madeline asked, ""Can I please go to the hospital first?""
She rarely begged like this. No matter how brutal the setbacks or how dire the circumstances, Madeline Turner had always held her head high.
To others, she was always the proud, brilliant scientist.
Her pleading tone made his hand pause mid-air. But Valerie chimed in right on cue, shattering the moment. 
""The hospital?"" She lowered her lashes, feigning vulnerability. ""But Maddy, to the world, you're already dead.
""If you show up as Madeline again... what about me?
""They'll drag up the plagiarism scandal all over. The storm hasn't passed yet."" 
She trailed off as if reluctant to say more, but Madeline saw the greedy triumph in her eyes. ""Could you... just hold on a little longer?""
Madeline could hardly believe what she was hearing. 
It was shameless.
Constant, untreated inflammation in the wrist could lead to permanent nerve damage. For a researcher like her, it was a career-ending injury.
""I can't hold on!"" she snapped. ""Valerie, aren't you being a little too selfish...""
Elwood cut her off, pressing her gently but firmly into a chair.
His voice softened as he persuaded, ""Be good. Just endure it a bit.""
""If it's really unbearable..."" He rose leisurely, fetched painkillers, and placed them in her palm. 
""Take these. The pain will fade.""

Chapter 4
Elwood practically forced the pills down Madeline's throat. The faint bitterness spread across her tongue like poison.
He thought she was trembling from the physical agony, but Madeline knew better. 
What truly made her sick was his blatant disregard.
He knew how vital her hands were to her work, yet he let Valerie's whims run wild.
He placed a piece of rib on her plate, his tone almost gentle. ""Just bear with it, honey. Be a good girl.""
She chewed the meat mechanically. It tasted like ash in her mouth. Her fork trembled in her grip, but Elwood pretended not to notice.
By the end of the meal, her hand had lost all control, shaking violently.
Out on the villa's balcony, she stared at the bulging veins on her wrist, a bitter smile tugging at her lips.
Then Valerie's voice drifted from behind. ""What are you thinking about, Maddy?""
Her eyes sparkled with mockery. 
A gentle breeze lifted her hair as she suddenly covered her mouth, her tone dripping with malice. ""Oh, wait—no, we can't call you Madeline anymore, can we? I guess I should call you Anonymous, right? After all... you're dead now.""
Madeline smiled faintly at the taunt. She hid her injured hand behind her back and stepped forward, her gaze sharp and commanding.
""You know what? Mediocre people can never replace true talent. So what if I'm 'dead'?""
She grabbed Valerie by the collar, anger surging in her voice. ""In two weeks, I'll still be Madeline Turner—and I'll always be leagues ahead of you!""
Valerie stumbled back, genuine fear flashing in her eyes.
Just then, Elwood appeared.
Catching sight of him out of the corner of her eye, Valerie suddenly grabbed Madeline's arm and deliberately leaned backward over the balcony railing.
Elwood lunged forward and yanked her back to safety.
Valerie immediately burst into tears, shamelessly twisting the truth. ""Maddy must really hate me. She just tried to push me!""
Elwood looked at her, his expression darkened.
Madeline waited for the explosion. 
She knew Elwood loathed deception and frame-ups more than anything; after all, he had once been the victim of such a scheme himself.
Instead, Elwood leaned down and kissed Valerie deeply.
When they finally pulled apart, he reached out and playfully flicked Valerie's nose. ""I know you're upset, but framing people? That's not a good habit.""
He paused, a chillingly indulgent smile on his face. ""Is your anger vented now?""
Valerie's cheeks were still flushed from that kiss.
Hearing his words, she froze for a second.
So he knew everything—and still chose her side, abandoning his own principles for her sake.
That was enough for Valerie.
She nodded, voice small and aggrieved. ""Yeah... I'm okay now.""
Madeline stood frozen, disbelief flooding her eyes.
She had never imagined that Elwood could love Valerie to this extent.
A bitter laugh escaped her as the pain spread through every fiber of her being.
Only then did Elwood finally turn to her.
He'd expected jealousy, perhaps a scream of rage. However, he saw a face as calm as a frozen lake.
""Carry on,"" Madeline said, her voice light and utterly indifferent. ""I'll leave you to it.""
With that, she stepped around them and walked away.

Chapter 5
Elwood's gaze followed her retreating figure.
He felt a sudden, inexplicable urge to chase after her, to demand to know why she wasn't fighting back. 
But Valerie's arms snaked around his neck, pulling him back. ""Let's keep going—we shouldn't waste Maddy's thoughtfulness.""
Looking at the girl in his arms—at the face that reminded him so much of a shadow from his past—a strange, turbulent fire flared in Elwood's chest.
He cupped her cheeks and kissed her fiercely.
Downstairs, Madeline glanced up at the two locked in a passionate embrace on the balcony above. Without hesitation, she snapped the shutter.
She scrolled through the flood of photos on her camera and let out a cold, mirthless laugh.
These were the pieces of evidence she had gathered over the past few days.
It was laughable and unbearably heartbreaking.
In public, they were the picture of propriety—the grieving husband and the loyal student. Everyone believed they were the people Madeline trusted most.
But behind closed doors, they were entangled, conspiring against her.
Today marked the seventh day since Evelyn's passing.
Madeline had sold her wedding ring on a secondhand marketplace for 200 thousand dollars. 
With the money, she'd bribed a doctor at the hospital.
When she finally held the urn containing her mother's ashes, her eyes blurred.
Evelyn had followed her from familiar New York to Washington just to care for her.
She'd always cooked Madeline's favorite dishes with endless care. In every way, Evelyn had been her only true sanctuary of warmth.
And now, that haven had crumbled. Her once-warm heart had stopped beating along with it.
At the cemetery, Madeline collapsed before the headstone, sobbing until her throat was raw.

1r3hgq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaSy/comments/1r3hgq2/what_are_some_tips_for_effective_remote_work/,What are some tips for effective remote work?,"Remote work has transformed the way businesses operate. Whether you're managing a distributed team or working independently, staying productive outside a traditional office requires structure, clarity, and the right technology. Here are practical and proven tips to make remote work truly effective.

**1. Create a Dedicated Workspace**

One of the biggest challenges of remote work is separating professional life from personal life. Set up a specific workspace at home that is quiet, comfortable, and free from distractions. This helps your brain associate that space with productivity. Even a small desk in a corner can make a huge difference in focus and efficiency.

**2. Maintain a Clear Daily Routine**

Consistency is powerful. Start and end your workday at fixed times. Plan your tasks the night before or early in the morning. Use time-blocking techniques to divide your day into focused work sessions. A structured schedule reduces procrastination and improves output.

**3. Prioritize Clear Communication**

In remote environments, communication gaps can easily happen. Use tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Zoom to stay connected. Set clear expectations about response times and meeting schedules. Written communication should be concise and structured to avoid confusion. Regular check-ins help maintain alignment and team morale.

**4. Leverage Remote Device Management Tools**

For companies managing distributed teams, security and control are critical. This is where [**remote device management**](https://www.easycontrol.io/blog/what-is-remote-device-management) plays a major role. It allows IT administrators to monitor, update, and secure devices from anywhere. Businesses can ensure that employees are working on compliant and protected systems without needing physical access.

Solutions like EasyControl help organizations streamline device oversight, enforce security policies, and manage applications remotely. With remote device management, companies can push updates, troubleshoot issues, and even lock devices if needed. This not only protects sensitive business data but also improves operational efficiency.

**5. Set Clear Goals and KPIs**

Productivity in remote work should be outcome-driven, not time-driven. Define clear goals and key performance indicators (KPIs) for every role. When employees understand expectations, they can prioritize tasks effectively and deliver measurable results.

**6. Take Regular Breaks**

Working from home often leads to longer screen time. Follow techniques like the Pomodoro method—25 minutes of focused work followed by a short break. Step away from your desk, stretch, or take a short walk. Breaks improve concentration and prevent burnout.

**7. Focus on Cybersecurity**

Remote work increases exposure to cyber risks. Employees should use secure Wi-Fi connections, strong passwords, and VPNs. Businesses should implement remote device management tools such as EasyControl to monitor devices, restrict unauthorized applications, and maintain data security standards across the organization.

**8. Encourage Team Engagement**

Isolation can reduce motivation. Organize virtual team-building activities, informal coffee chats, or recognition sessions. A strong company culture can thrive even in remote setups when communication and appreciation remain consistent.

**9. Invest in the Right Technology**

Fast internet, reliable hardware, and collaboration tools are essential. Companies that adopt advanced remote device management platforms like EasyControl ensure seamless control over distributed devices, helping teams stay productive without technical disruptions.

Effective remote work is not just about working from home—it’s about working smartly with structure, communication, and technology. By combining disciplined routines with powerful tools like **EasyControl** and remote device management systems, businesses can maintain productivity, security, and team collaboration from anywhere in the world.",1,1770962774.0,SaaSy,0,1.0,False

Now that the FLDS has mostly become diluted in the area, I'm shocked a lot of the LDS efforts aren't going there. Real estate there is cheap, members could move there, and the Church could easily build a temple there.

I'm surprised because breweries, coffee shops, etc. Are going there and establishing a new look for the place. But Mormons are minimally there.

I sleep restlessly, waking on a nigh hourly basis to unsettling scuttles across the floor, growing faster and sounding more effortless each time it disturbs me. The scuttling is accompanied by quiet murmuring, just loud enough for me to hear. Like that of a passive-aggressive spouse, wanting to make sure their words are loud enough to be heard and hurtful, but not loud enough for the other to be exactly sure what's being said. 

Eventually, I manage to drift into a sleep deep enough to dream. I fail to recall any specific details, as they faded quickly upon my waking, though the warm sensation of fear slowly slithering up the base of my neck towards my head remains. A childlike fear brought on only by the nastiest of nightmares, the kind of fear that can bring long-buried memories to the surface so that the brain may have something to compare the horror to. Besides this primal dread, nothing remains of the dream besides one rather vivid image, that of writhing fingers. Countless of them, ‘twas all there was. Writhing at me, *reaching* at me, all seeming to have some individual consciousness and motive rather than being one grand amalgam. All of them were a deep and dark shade of grey, twinged with the mildest hint of navy-blue. Not at all dissimilar to the flesh of the Mocking Tongue.

Speaking of which, I manage to hear part of its muttered tirade as I am ungraciously welcomed back into the world of the living in a groggy, grumpy haze. The Mocking Tongue seems rather displeased with my choice of name.

“‘Mocking Tongue’ he writes, pah! The utter lack of creativity…sicking- *emusnoc* \- enough to send waves of nausea through the bowels I lack.”

So yes, It is still here, sadly not a product of my intoxicated mind, though that isn’t to say It’s not a product of psychosis of some degree. What a pleasant thought. Better yet, It seems to be evolving. At the very least, Its capabilities for speech and critical thought are developing more and more by the moment. I lay unmoving in my bed for a mere handful of moments before the Mocking Tongue’s aggression becomes louder and more direct. I didn’t need to show the slightest sign of life. It seemed to simply *know* I had awoken. It tells me what the time is and critiques me on my unwillingness to see the sun rise. It points out how little time truly remains in my day despite the fact that I am only now coming back to the world of the living. It mentions how night will rather soon be upon me and with it another excuse to say to Hell with it and go down in a lazy cloud of drunken smoke.

As it rambles, I lie on my side, staring into my own eyes in the sunlit mirror on the wall above my dresser. The rats nest upon my head appears to me a mockery of hygiene, and the filth that lies below it is entirely unbearable to focus on too much. I can only stare into my eyes, as, despite their sunken, tired, bagged, hollow nature, they are the one aspect of my physical being I feel can be commended. I wish only that I could see a soul hidden within the abysses of my pupils, but instead I’m reminded of the Well. I feel the sinking sensation of it being dug deeper into my chest. Maybe if only I had someone else within this bed, far too big for just me, maybe then I could, at the very, *very* least, distract myself from it all, even for just a moment. Perhaps the Well, in time, could be filled.

Even deeper still. I think once more of the peace that must lie down there. What kind of frets can you have when you have no mind with which to fret? Seems the only logical decision would be to merely succumb to that Oblivion. Let it consume me as I return to nothingness.

Perhaps someday, but not today. For I must continue, for some reason. Everyone has *some* reason, right? If someone is entirely failing to find hope, they must be failing to look hard enough, right? Surely. 

“Tell yourself what you must- *bmuccus*\- worm, but you know the painful, unspoken, undeniable truth of your life and that of every- *ot sih*\- man and woman upon this worthless- *lliw*\- plane.”

It need not say it, I recognise the speech of such an intensely nihilistic creature anywhere. I’ve spent all my life trying with all my will-

“What will?” It barks out.

\- to avoid such a mindset, going as far as to think things such as *sure, perhaps it all means nothing, but all that means is we shall create our own meaning!* And now here I am, met with Hell's most stubborn demon, trying with all *Its* will to break me down to such a state. Eventually, I am forced to my feet by an intense wave, really more of a tsunami of nausea, the reality of exactly how drunk I got last night strking my entire body all at once. I stumble intensely, catching myself on the dresser, knocking over an old framed picture of an old friend I haven’t spoken to in years. There was no bad blood; we, more honestly, I, simply drifted away, as I so miserably tend to do, even despite my best efforts. I kick the cracked frame out of my way thoughtlessly.

Fighting off the worst spins of my life, a headache more intensely splitting than the sky on the day of the rapture, and stomach sickness that would put an anorexic model into the hospital, I manage to find the bathroom. I begin to suffer the single worst hangover I have ever had, and as it turns out, ever will suffer through. It takes three hours of hugging the toilet, mostly unanswered prayers, a continuous verbal onslaught from behind, and occasional shouts of protest from myself when I could muster the spare breath until I finally began to collect myself. I shift, my bare and sore knees exposed now to the cold air, ass planted on the equally cold floor beneath me. I’m struggling to scrawl away my recounting of this event through my haze and the Mocking Tongue’s barrage, but it seems to be keeping the stomach illness away, so write I will.

Bright beams of morning sunlight cut through the glass of the window, only worsening my already splitting migraine. A searing pain, deep behind my eyes, deeper still within the depths of my temples. Suddenly It’s voice stops ever so briefly, and when It continues, It’s tone has shifted just enough to alarm me. It’s unusually calm, addressing me almost as if it pities the state I’m in. The shock of this change gets me to look at the beast rather quickly for the first time since waking.

“You’re unclean, you know?” It taunts, It’s progression in verbal complexity finally frightening me just as well as it should, “not merely in a physical matter, nay, though the rot within thyself caused by the drink and smoke surely does exist, I speak of less palpable aspects of thy being. The aspects of thyself which I *am* sure of. What I can speak to in full confidence is thy character, thee’s innermost thoughts; tucked away tightly between and behind the rocks of that Well thou enjoys pondering on so.”

It causes me a great deal of excessive, avoidable pain, and yet I roll my eyes.

“Ignore me then, fool. I’ll have thee know, though, that I find it better not to have to waste the breath and words on such putrid concepts.”

I stand, semi-ready to face the rest of the day ahead of me with this…*thing* at my side. I sigh a disappointed, slightly defeated sigh; how bad could it truthfully be after all, I suppose? In reality, what really differs from before? Now I just have my inner monologue personified and damned to follow me around in my monotonous routine.

And so, I carry on, with just a little bit less energy and will to do so than the day prior.

“Such a stained soul, rotted and atrophied beyond recovery from years of petty, spiteful rage.”

My fists clench; It’s clearly correct.

“Minute pangs of annoyance and massive pileups of misery you cling onto as if they are thy lifeblood merely continue to fester, and like a fungus sprouting from a rotting corpse, it breeds, spreads, grows and consumes thee from within. Pah, and thou wonders why none will afford thee the luxury of love, why would they? Why, if thou cannot afford that very luxury to thyself and this life you have been granted?”

With these final words, what few fragments of will I’d managed to gather for the day are broken down and scattered once more. My shoulders slump, eyes lower, and I feel the everblack festering within the gaping maw of that Well within my chest. Moving slowly towards the kitchen, I hear a call from deep within the confines of my own mind, or perhaps a call from somewhere beyond.

*Peace lies within me, within the arteries of my vacuumous heart; you must merely embrace the dark.*

Ha! I’ve gone entirely mad! After all, only mad men hear voices, much less ponder on such seemingly counterproductive ideas! Then again, I’d likely be rather hard-pressed to think of one sane man who would ever, in a million centuries, claim to have encountered a being such as this Mocking Tongue. Another voice cuts through the hungover, racing haze of my train of thought to chime in with It’s own river of obscenity.

“How pathetically weak thou art. Pondering such a concept as suicide, yes, let's call it for what it is, why don’t we?! Enough with thy avoidant round-about talk of Wells and depths and everblacks; poppycock, I say! Look ‘round thee, worm! Besides my presence and the unpleasant realities I force thee to face, thy life is good. The roof over thy head is excessively grand, the food on thy table delicious, and the family around thee loving and supporting, and yet thou cannot help but gripe, whine, and intoxicate thyself. Make it make sense, worm.”

I enter the kitchen huffing and puffing, face slowly reddening from the frustration.

“Thou hast utterly convinced thyself of the existence of some sort of cosmic spite against thee as some pathetic form of an excuse to endlessly indulge in searing rage; a flame that eats away at every bridge thou hast built, worm. Every insult; every snarky, backhanded comment; every unnecessary outburst. These will be what crumble the seemingly stable foundations of what few relationships thou hast managed to cultivate in your life. Ye will rot away in here, worm, alone, lost in a mire of self-pitious depression and gluttonous overindulgence in all things, rage included.”

Finally, I snap out a loud scoff and turn to the damned thing, ready to face it head-on.

“I’ve had more than my fill of you...Whatever it is exactly that you may be! Be gone with you, wretched, bile-spewing hellbeast!” I shout out as I approach the Mocking Tongue, raising my foot when I get close enough for the hit. I become briefly lost in this moment. There is nought but my objective, nothing but the hateful violence I want- nay- must commit for my very own sanity; all else fades away into an aetherial haze, pigmented red with rage. His words no longer dig into my heart and soul, no longer able to grip me tight by my terribly malleable emotions. Every pervasive existential feeling of purposelessness, insignificance, love and the lack thereof, and of course, death itself are all silenced. With all the force I can muster in my admittedly weak leg, in combination with decades of various repressed thoughts and feelings, I kick the fucker to the high Heavens. My foot comes soaring through the air, swinging mightily like the perfectly just gavel of God, ready to deliver its Old-Testament form of Holy fury and collides with the Mocking Tongue.

The collision produces a ridiculously comical thud, and the Hellbeast itself manages to blurt out some gruff grunt of pain. It soars across the kitchen with an almost admirable lack of any speed or grace, seeming to flail around in a very sporadic sort of way. Like a falling cat that seems to be wriggling nonsensically in the sky, only to land perfectly upon Its feet; only this cat is blind. It crashes into several cast-iron pots and pans hanging upon a wall fixture made of a similar material. It falls to the ground, flustered and likely hurt to some degree, even managing to land on its back. Like something straight out of a joke-story a friend would tell you, several of the still shaking and clattering pots and pans manage to slip off the fixture from all the force, falling and crashing directly into the Mocking Tongue. During the whole ordeal, It produces some sound along the lines of;

“Nnuaghtnthh!!” though I couldn’t possibly do it justice with mere pen and paper.

This finally gets me to crack a smile. I even begin to chuckle at it all. A brief moment of clarity washes over my mind as the sheer absurdity of it all sinks in. Not just the Mocking Tongue, Its very existence, the words It speaks, nor Its omniscense, nay, life as a whole. Every misstep and general fumble somehow now seems even funnier than the last. Perhaps mania has managed to rear its deceptively beautiful head, slyly creeping its way into my mind without my notice, much less invitation.

The Mocking Tongue lies on the back of Its palm, fingers writhing aimlessly in the air, the whole thing rocking back and forth ever so gently. It produces soft, strained noises, occasionally punctuated with wet, whooping hacks. Jubilant humour practically overwhelms me! I begin to curl over slightly, holding my bouncing belly. My deep chortling chuckle gradually grows into a full-blown, tear-inducing manic cackle.

“Enough,” it demands with a somewhat gruffer tone of voice, “By Beezlebub, Baal, Belphagor, and every blasphemous beast in Hell, you worm, listen to thyself! Even for the love of thine so unfair God!”

The attempts to quell my fit with such unspeakable names and unholy proclamations fall upon largely deaf ears; as, tell me, how could one possibly fear anything, much less just take it seriously in such a pathetic state? This thing is entirely immobilised, entirely exposed, and there is nothing It can do about it. It is at rock bottom, and it feels so beautifully natural to berate the beast. I regain my breath, shaking my head and sighing that of a good, hearty laugh into my hand as it continues.

“Thy glee is unfounded! What hast thee truly accomplished, hmm? Nought but a childish explosion of uncontrolled emotion, based on no amount of reason, not a fragment of logistical thought,” the Mocking Tongue lowers its voice to a much clearer, sharper, and surer tone, “Evade me as thou wilt, worm, but know that thou will hear my words. No matter what may separate us, may it be great distances of land or the one-way veil of death, you will hear my words and hear them well. Deep within thy subconscious mind, within the quietest, darkest mould-infested corners. They will take root, thou wilt know them as true, and they will rot thee from the inside forevermore.”

The latter half of this diatribe slices through my thin veil of ego-fueled triumph like a red-hot blade through pre-softened butter. My face falls as quickly as the sinking in my chest returns to remind me of the Well, of the everblack within. A newfound anxiety creeps slowly up my back, spreading around the base of my neck before climbing its way up to ensnare my temples with its faux warmth I’ve come to dread.

I lean upon the countertop behind me, the white-ish cobbled stone cool in my grip. The Mocking Tongue ceases It’s yapping to focus It’s energy on more *pressing* matters, so to speak. As I begin to finally collect myself, from behind me and to the left, I hear the queerest noise. At first, it flies directly through and past my field of perception, lost pondering of…*things* I’ve spoken of prior and am sure to bring up again. The persistent, nagging nature of the noise eventually gnaws through my trance, becoming simply too tiresome to ignore any longer. My gaze is drawn to the wall to my left that the corner counter intersects with. The kitchen is a finely built room, with walls of well-placed cobblestones inlaid with an expertly crafted and laid mortar. But only one black-sheep of a stone shows signs of its decades of age; it shifts slightly with every odd tip-tap. The mortar is strangely crumbled and decrepit. Bits of it fall to the countertop along with a healthy heaping of asthma-inducing dust.

I take notice of how little difference the dust and fragments make to the overall state of my kitchen. It immediately calls the room’s state of disarray to my attention. Dishes piled in the sink, trash cans overflowing, the sounds of scuttling mice. I run my hand through my hair as a sickened grimace curls my lip. I was somewhat aware of the destructive nature of my habits, but to have it so clearly slap me in so many different ways in such a short span of time; I’d been in a slump for days before the Mocking Tongue made its ungracious appearance. A vicious cycle of smoke, drink, self-pity, indulge, indulge, indulge. ‘Till my brain is a numb husk of chemical imbalance, incapable of the most base functions of existing as a person worth being in this crooked world. Lost in the intoxicating haze of gluttonous overindulgence. So much so that I’ve begun to neglect the basic necessities of being human, such as keeping one's own abode as clean as they *should* keep themselves. 

My train of thought is interrupted, and a lump is immediately shoved down my throat when the stone falls entirely out of the wall and onto the counter with a violent *THUD*. In my thoughtful, sleepy trance, I managed to almost wholly miss the gradual removal of the stone. My heart flutters and palpates, and I grip my chest in pain. From out of the wall crawls a sight that drops my heart low enough, I feel as if it could limbo dance with the Devil. I gag at the very prospect of what I see; another hand, not dissimilar whatsoever to the Mocking Tongue, comes wriggling down from the entrance it so inconsiderately created for itself. It’s flesh of the same navy-blue-toned grey, with long, unkempt nails and dirty knuckles laden with scarring. Yet it bears no wounds, most perplexingly, where the hand appears to have been ‘cut off’ so to speak, there is no wound present; only an uncannily smooth and cylindrical mass of rounded flesh with perfect complexion besides the general colour. No scars, no bumps, no holes. I may not have met many amputees in my day, but I know damn well their wounds look nothing like this.

I’m frozen in shock and some feeling I can’t quite describe nor place my finger on. Dismay? Dumbfoundedness? Complete and utter apathy?! No, not the latter, certainly not that one. I feel some way towards this thing, but it isn’t careless apathy, and that realisation in and of itself makes me feel alive in an odd way. To feel something, *anything* besides that bland, blank sense of “blah” about something for even a moment, it's magnificent.

One of these disembodied, likely supernatural hands was odd enough, but now two? Utterly preposterous, what if yet more come?! What shall I do then? What could I possibly do? I haven’t yet a clue what I am to do regarding the first Hellbeast, and now more are joining the brigade, it’s almost enough to send me back into that hysterical, hyena-esque laughter from earlier. 

The new hand scuttles across my counter as I stand still, frozen, mouth agape and eyes bulging out of my skull. When It approaches me, It too rises, standing just like the Mocking Tongue, with Its thumb and pinky functioning as legs of sorts. As It rises, It makes Its prodominent difference from the Mocking Tongue known and inadvertently earns Itself a new name in my mind. Where the Mocking Tongue has a mouth, the Wandering Nose has a small, rapidly flaring nose. The flesh of the palm is barely welded to the nose, the whole thing looking almost like the work of a maniacal plastic surgeon whose license should have been revoked long, long ago. Despite the relatively small structure of the nose, the nostrils are all too large for normality's sake, and the flesh that connects the bridge of the nose to the palm a little too thin. It sniffs, nostrils pulsating like those of a curious dog learning the scent of a new friend, or perhaps enemy. The skin of my back crawls, feeling as if it wishes to writhe right off my body and run or slither as far away from these things as possible.

I almost subconsciously decide to sniff for myself, and immediately regret the decision. Before the Mocking Tongue mutters another word, I become disquietingly aware of my recent neglect of hygiene and the rancid result I’m left with. I smell of-

“Ugh, sickening,” The Mocking Tongue interrupts my thoughts once more, “festering night sweat and the unwashed dirt of many days!”

And so it seems my condition no longer needs explaining. The Wandering Nose’s huffing persists, and it dawns on me that this one will likely be as stubborn and determined as the last.

“Thy form stinks of neglect and grime equally as thy soul stinks of rot and rage. Tell me, how does a man living such a relatively fine life justify such constant misery and self-destruction? And, too, tell me why a man, or anyone for that matter, with a body so temporary, that does thee so well, seems to make his most valiant effort to rapidly accelerate the body’s natural forms of atrophy?”

I struggle to find an answer as I gracelessly fall from the high horse I had just finally gotten comfortable on. Every point It has made is entirely valid, miserably true. Damn It and Its increasing ability to pry into my mind with those wriggling fingers and weigh me down even more than my own inhibitions can manage. I, just like you and every other sad sack on this Earth, am already born into such a short life, and I ask, is it fair that I am condemned to spend what few fading years I may have left worrying about many of the same things I have since I was a boy, some of which have merely evolved, manifesting themselves in progressively more miserable ways? Is it fair that a man may spend all day, every day worrying, just to die in regretful worry over all the time he wasted worrying? The sickest, cruellest joke of it all is the way our - at the *very* least my - perception of time seems to increase gradually, faster and faster as if it’s gaining momentum until it all comes to a sudden, solemn, saddeningly quiet end. Hours turn to days turn to weeks turn to yadda yadda yadda until you snap back to the reality of it all for a fleeting moment, just long enough to wonder how exactly it is you got here.

Even still, I can’t help but willfully wittle away at the sand left in my hourglass with every swig and puff. Worse yet, I can’t even be bothered to pretend to respect myself while I still live this life.

I gather all of my willpower and use it to quickly construct a mental wall to block off the incessant river flowing with such horrid thoughts. I move, putting some pep in my step, attempting to, with my best efforts, ignore the relentless torrent of abuse from these writhing displays of blasphemy made flesh. I must get moving, accomplish *something*. The day is young for me, but the sun knows it well already. The exact time is hard to tell, with the only two clocks in the house being above the front door and the dysfunctional but eldritchly beautiful hand-carved grandfather clock that's been in my family for three generations now. Bought from an old, queer little port town in Massachusetts that you’d be hard-pressed to find on any map that doesn’t originate from it, though the name evades me at the moment.

“Face it,” The Mocking Tongue barks, “thy heart is as empty of love and fellowship as thy own home.”

I grab my jug of pre-made coffee, pouring some into a small pot over an even smaller flame on the stove. Rubbing my eyes with my thumb and index finger, I push hard into my caruncles with every deep jab from the Mocking Tongue. I feel as if I’m pushing through this painfully average morning routine entirely devoid of thought, like a mindless marionette being strung along for the enjoyment of these Hellbeasts. I close my eyes and daydream of someplace dark, quiet, and solitary. I daydream of the Well. I daydream of peace; a selfish kind of peace, all my own for me and me alone, rest of the world be damned. 

*What makes me so special, though?* I ponder, why do I deserve such a peace? A sort of peace that, sure, may quell my every qualm, but would surely deeply trouble at least a handful of people. So I would like to think, at least. After all, I’m not entirely devoid of family. Knowing there may be *someone* out there who would jump into the infinite dark after me is enough to keep my feet firmly planted on the ground.

“Ha! And tell me, fool, who would ever jump into that everblack for a worm such as thyself, whom time and time again proves himself to be such a villainous waste?”

I struggle to find an answer as the coffee begins to steam.

*Sniff-sniff-sniff*

“Thy scent is like that of no man to walk this earth. No, it’s uniquely putrid. Laden with hints of shattered will and,” *sniff-sniff*, “ah, yes, incredibly underwhelming amounts of testosterone! Haha! And not to mention the thick smell of alcohol wafting down from that gaping maw of yours. To think, such a strong scent and thou hastn’t had so much as a sip *yet* today.”

My fists clench as the coffee in the pot rises past the point of heat at which I originally intended to remove it from the stove, entirely out of my notice. My knuckles grow whiter with every moment, and my fingernails draw blood from my palms. I’m resting my head on the wall cupboard before me, eyes closed, lost in my own mind, searching for any way out, and a map out of this goddamned situation on my way. The countless labyrinthine mental walls I’ve built to protect my own sanity, twisting, turning, and shifting, sending me in pointless circles of thought that always lead back to the same horrible, lazy conclusions.

I turn my lowered gaze for a moment to the Wandering Nose, almost staring at It through my eyebrows. The cacophony surrounding me of boiling coffee and hurtful words blurs into a tinnitus-esque hum. With my gaze I intend to portray the purest strain of hate; the sort of hate that only burns in the heart of the most wrathful, billowing flames in the deepest caverns of Hell. Hate that can only be found after digging down through layer after layer of jaded callousness and emotional numbness. I wish only that the damn thing could see me. Never have I felt such rage. In a moment of pure wrathful indulgence, I grab the Wandering Nose and plunge it into the boiling pot of coffee, it being just deep enough to entirely submerge the writhing beast. The Mocking Tongue’s diatribe is immediately cut off with a pained *ughrkk!* The blazing heat of the boiling liquid on my own hand means nothing at the moment in the face of my raging inferno of fury and spite. I let out pained, shouted curses of my own as I hold the frantically wriggling mass of fingers in place, It’s nails tearing at my bubbling, blistering flesh. Burns progress from first degree to second, in one spot even to a third.

“Enough!” I can hardly make out the Mocking Tongue’s backhanded pleas for me to stop; I’m too busy trying my hardest to ignore the crackling skin and popping blisters, “enough of this tomfoolery, I say, be *reasonable*, worm! Thou’rt harming thyself more than thee could ever hope to harm beings such as we!”

It begins to lose me, but the uttering of ""indescribably foolish worm,” somewhere within his blabbering is enough to stoke the flames of my hate once more. Every nerve in my hand cries, nay, screams out in a horrid, hot symphony of pain that I can bear to listen to no longer. I cry out a loud, primal call of agony once more as I rip my hand from the pot, proceeding to throw the Wandering Nose onto the floor with all my might. It splats on the ground in a discombobulated puddle of coffee and pitiful confusion. I give It a final stomp or two for good measure, taking not even a moment to pay any mind to Its condition afterwards. After all, I have more pressing matters to attend to with my *own* hand. I walk past the Mocking Tongue, *rasp-rasping* oh so charmingly along to his ol’ buddy ol’ pal Wandering Nose. I shake my head, a flood of emotions running through me that creates a rather sour sort of punch. Cups of confusion, heaps of melancholy, and a dash or two of relief as I walk further and further from the still panicked insults of the Mocking Tongue. 

In the bathroom, searching for bandages, the pain hits me like a hundred trains coming from a hundred angles. I fall to my trembling knees; beginning to sweat, I force a pained shout through gritted teeth. I turn for a moment to the only thing I’ve neglected as of late more than my mental and physical health; I turn to the spiritual. To God. No real, genuine faith exists within the half-baked and hollow mutters for reprieve shakily uttered through tears I can’t contain. Nay, no faith that my prayers wont fall upon deaf ears, only raw, instinctual desperation.

“I know you will damn me, lord,” I manage between breathy sobs, “I too know that you…you have *cursed* me. To a form of damnation I feel entirely unable to escape. Lord, I beg for a sign, I beg for a reason. Why must I be cursed with such damnation in life when surely it will follow too in death? Release me, Lord. Save me.  Grace me with thy salvation-”

I hear the Mocking Tongue’s voice echo through the hallway, ignorantly interrupting my attempts at repentance. This sound is accompanied by the faint rustling of the Wandering Nose helping It’s companion to It’s feet (fingers?). I gather some air in a shaky breath and open my eyes to find the exact bandages I was looking for, hiding just out of view on the small shelf underneath the sink. I clean and wrap my wounds gently, careful not to burst any of the blisters or irritate any of the already open abscesses, trying dearly to ignore the devil on my floor.

“I would spit upon thee for thy cries to thine Holy Father if I only had the saliva necessary to do so! The very muttering of his name by thy tongue, ugh, should be considered *blasphemous* in its very nature! Like dragging a bible through a bog! Every day you lead a life wading through the swampy marshes of sin, hiding from the light of God under every dead branch, small outcrop, and moist cave; and yet, ye want to crawl to him on thy belly like the wounded worm you are. Dripping with the essence of the unholy.”

The two hands enter the doorway behind me.

“Admit it to me, worm,” The Mocking Tongue has taken on a commandingly calm and quiet tone, as if a teacher demanding an answer from a student, “admit what you are.”

I take a deep breath. In for eight, hold for four, out for six. When the wrapping of my hand is finished, I turn and make my way towards my study, making my best attempt to keep my composure, even for a moment. My refusal enrages the beast, and all along the way It barks Its order.

“Admit it! Admit what you are!”

I attempt to rub away the migraine that has found its home deep within my temples. I’m unsure of what to do with myself, barely able to hear myself think over its cacophonous babbling.

“For the love of the God thee claims to worship, admit it, you gluttunous, overindulgent, self-pretentious, over-wired-”

I cut it off for once, “I am a worm!”

And yet it persists, unsatisfied with my verbal acknowledgement of my insignificance. It commands I admit this and that and the third; miserable. God. Damn. Miserable.

“I’m a worm! Goddamnit, I’m the foulest wretched imp to crawl its way out of Hell- by Christ, just for fifteen forgiving minutes would you stop your fucking *mwaa-mwaa-mwaa-raa-raa-raa-blaa-blaa-blaa*!?”

I turn to a nigh childish tone of mockery. I immediately recognise that I’m likely just feeding the Mocking Tongue ammunition with such a boyish reaction, but It brushes over it without a second thought. Instead, it continues to demand my admission of failure.

I think of all the rope in the house, high up places to hang it, and short enough chairs to stand on. I think of the rifle I have hanging over the mantle of the fireplace in my study, just two measly bullets sitting upon the mantle below it; though, of course, I would only need one. I think of the knives of various lengths, serrations, and levels of sharpness that are in my kitchen. 

I think that, perhaps, I might just need to step outside. Get some fresh air. I spit on the Mocking Tongue as I rush past the two, attempting to ignore them besides that gesture of spite. Grabbing a black hat, deep-red scarf, and dark-grey coat, I decide I’ll meander my way down to the small town park. It has a short path and an even smaller pond, but it's charming. With any luck, I may see a neat animal or bird, perhaps a Raven. Small blessings are exceedingly easy to recognise in times such as these.

I open the door, step outside, and quickly slam the door shut before the pitter-pattering hands (whom I’ve noticed are getting progressively better at moving as well as speech and thought) may come too close to joining me on my walk.

The sky is dull and grey, and a light breeze carries a deep chill through the streets full of strangers I’ll never know, even if I’d like to.

Most notably of all, for but a moment, it’s quiet.

1r3haic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1r3haic/my_sister_in_laws_tragedy_or_my_best_friends/,My sister in laws tragedy or my best friends birthday?,"Here comes my overthinking brain dump:

My best friend’s birthday is tomorrow, but it’s also the anniversary of the day my sister-in-law had to have a hysterectomy to save her life. Having children was something she always wanted, and it was devastating for both her and her husband.

Originally, my best friend was going to be working that day, so I told my sister-in-law I would be there for whatever she needed. My plan was to spend the day supporting her, and then once her husband got home from work (he can’t afford to take time off), I would go do something with my best friend later. That arrangement worked perfectly.

Then my best friend was able to get the day off and wanted to do daytime things like thrifting, getting coffee, and just having a relaxed day. My sister-in-law said that actually sounded nice to her too, and that getting out of the house might help instead of being alone and sad all day. It felt like everything was back on track.

Some background: my sister-in-law has told me that I’m the only person besides her husband who has ever consistently included her, checked on her, and made her feel safe and understood as a chronically ill person. I’m chronically ill too, and we support each other in that way. Her family offers her criticism but no real support, so this anniversary is especially painful and heavy for her.

I’ve spent almost every day with her this past week. As the anniversary has gotten closer, her mood swings have become more intense. Earlier this week, the three of us spent a day together, and overall it went well, but there were a couple moments where her behavior made both me and my best friend uncomfortable. It wasn’t anything huge—more like “I want to speak to your manager” energy that gave us secondhand embarrassment, and one comment she made that didn’t sit right with us. We brushed it off at the time.

Last night, she hurt my feelings. I helped her husband pick out some gifts to cheer her up, and she didn’t like my choices. She made jokes about it and laughed, but it still hurt. I didn’t say anything to her about it, but I did tell my best friend, and she was upset on my behalf.

Today, my sister-in-law made chocolate-covered strawberries for my best friend’s birthday and for me as a Valentine’s gift. Food is her love language, and I thought that was incredibly thoughtful, especially considering everything she’s going through. She even made extra for my best friend. Despite that kindness, I can feel tension building between them.

Earlier, when the birthday plans first came up, my sister-in-law was upset that my best friend still wanted to go out. She suggested going on Wednesday instead, but my best friend declined because she wanted to celebrate on her actual birthday and have money to spend after getting paid. My best friend said there was no point in staying home and being sad, and no point in me doing that with her if that’s what my sister-in-law chose. Meanwhile, my sister-in-law felt sad at the thought of being alone and also felt pressured to go out even if she wasn’t emotionally ready.

Today, my sister-in-law said she didn’t want to go anymore and got a little snippy, even though we weren’t pressuring her. My best friend saw it as dramatic behavior, but I saw it more as her being overwhelmed and struggling emotionally. Later in the day, she changed her mind again and said she did want to go.

Now my best friend no longer wants her to come. She loves her, but she’s worried that her mood swings could negatively affect the day. She doesn’t want her birthday ruined, cut short, or to feel responsible for managing someone else’s emotional triggers. She just wants to enjoy her day. She even offered to go by herself and reassured me she isn’t upset with me—she just doesn’t want me to feel anxious or caught in the middle. She said me going with her to her nail appointment would be enough.

But that doesn’t feel right to me. We haven’t been able to properly celebrate her birthday in years, and I’ve already been spending a lot more time with my sister-in-law lately. I don’t want my best friend to feel neglected because I can’t figure out how to balance this.

Meanwhile, my sister-in-law is texting me saying she’s in a lot of pain and will need her cane and scooter, but she still doesn’t want to stay home.

In a perfect world, we would all go out together and have a good day. But realistically, there’s a risk that her emotional state could make my best friend uncomfortable and unable to fully enjoy her birthday, and I’ll be stuck in the middle trying to manage everything. It doesn’t feel fair to ask my sister-in-law to hide her emotions on such a painful anniversary, but it also doesn’t feel fair to ask my best friend not to enjoy her birthday.

We also don’t have the option of taking separate cars because my car broke down yesterday, and hers has been broken down for a while.

No one seems willing or able to fully compromise, and previous attempts haven’t worked. My best friend has been looking forward to recreating this exact birthday tradition for years because the last time we did it, it was amazing, and we haven’t been able to do it since.

I’m worried my entire day will be spent mediating and trying to keep everyone emotionally stable while also managing my own chronic illness.

To add to that, my sister-in-law’s husband texted me at 1am last night saying she’s been having multiple breakdowns and likely won’t be in the right headspace to go with us, which is significant because he had previously encouraged her to go.

I genuinely don’t know what the right thing to do is.

Speaker (S): Ugh, don’t get me started! I was totally going to start writing that assignment. Like, I literally had my laptop open and everything. But oh my gosh, that new Chanel bag. Have you seen it? LIke no, really, have you? Because the stitching alone is–

  
Jessica(J): Yeah, it looks–

  
S: Ehem…Jessica. I was just about to get to the good part.

Huff. As I was saying, the bag is obviously worth skipping one night of sleep over. The colour is totes my style.

Honestly, if the professor didn’t want us procrastinating, maybe he shouldn’t have assigned it during fashion week. I mean, what did he expect? That I’d ignore couture for citations? 

\[Laugh\] Please. I have standards.

Oh sweetie, what are you doing here?

\[Short Pause\]

  
J: Erm (Speaker’s name *Feel free to leave out* ), I think you are sitting on his desk. You might want to move. 

  
S: \[Scoffs lightly, amused\] And who’s talking to you Jessica? He can speak for himself, can’t you, dear? 

And besides… I think he doesn’t really mind that I’m here. \[Leans close\] Isn’t that right, cutie? 

\[Chuckle\]

\[...\]

S: See? I told you. He doesn’t mind.

\[To J\] Honestly, you worry too much. If he had a problem, he’d say something.

  
S: Huh. well since I’m already here. Guess we’ll just have to share. Don’t we darling?

\[Playful\]  What? Don’t tell me you’re shy *now*. Come on, it’s just a seat.  
\[Lower voice\] Unless… you were thinking something else…

So…Oh come on. Are you gonna keep standing there like a lost puppy, or are you going to sit down?

Ehem, I don’t usually ask twice. But I guess, this is something new. And I like new.

  
J: Um, I really think you’re making him uncomfortable. You’re being kind of… intense.

  
S: If he were uncomfortable, he would have moved. Or spoken. Or, honestly, run away by now.

\[Turns to L, ignoring J\] But you didn’t, did you? Exactly. You didn’t.

{Listener takes his seat} Mhm. Thought so.

See, Jessica? Crisis avoided.

  
\[Pause\]

  
Anyway ugh, that assignment. Tell me I’m not the only one totally dying over here.

\[Dramatic sigh\] I swear, this class is testing my patience.

{Looks around the room briefly, then back to the listener}

Like, I try to pay attention. I really do. But there’s something...or someone... that just too distracting 

  
{S pauses, watching the listener, who begins taking out his notes, shuffling papers?}

  
S: Wait…

Are you… taking your notes out? \[Pause\] Oh my god, you did take notes, didn’t you?

You’re one of those people?

Wow, I really judged you wrong. I thought you were just quiet, not secretly responsible.

  
J: He’s just being prepared. You should be focusing on the lessons you know, the professor said there’s going to be a test on this next week.

  
S: \[Ignoring J\] What, prepared is attractive.

Sorry, but move over, I’ll be sitting here. 

  
{Speaker moves from desk to sitting beside listener}

  
S: Don’t look so tense.

If I wanted your seat, I’d have taken it already.

\[Leans closer\] Okay, let me see that.

  
\[Pause\]

  
S: What? Is there something on my face?

I just want to get a closer look, so let me see it.

  
{Speaker slowly reads through the notes}

  
S : …Huh. 

\[Scoffs lightly\] Okay, these are actually really neat. I’ll need these. 

Here. 

{Passes phone to listener} Put your number in.

Not asking. Just do it. I’ll text you so don’t forget to send these over..

\[Glances up\] Don’t let it go to your head. I’m just surprised you understood half of what he was rambling about.

  
S: I totally missed this part here, about… this part here. What this whole methodology section is about.

He explained it, but then he went off on one of those weird tangents about his research trip, and ugh yeah, I mentally checked out.

  
{Speaker plays with the notebook, before pressing it to the listener} So, explain it to me.

  
\[Fake focus\] S: Mm-hm.

Okay.

That actually makes sense.

Wait,say that again. Yeah. Like that.

\[Smug\]Wow. Look at you. Being useful.

  
J: You know, you could just pay attention in class and review the slides later.

S:Or…\[Close the notebook gently\]

I could do this.

  
S: \[Facing the listener\]Hey, you know, this assignment is worth, like, a stupid amount of our grade, right?

\[Sighs\] But I refuse to let my GPA suffer just because the professor has a pacing issue.

Are you free later this week?

  
J: Later for what?

  
S: \[Fast\] Studying.

Obviously.

I learn better when someone explains it directly. Preferably someone patient… And cute.

  
S: We could go over the lecture together.

You explain things like that again, I pretend I’m listening, and somehow we both survive.

\[Flirty\] Mutually beneficial.

  
S: There’s that café near campus. You know, the one that just opened with the big windows and decent coffee.

It’s quiet enough to focus…\[Leans in\] but not so quiet that it’s awkward.

  
J: That sounds suspiciously like a date.



S: Oh please. \[Softer to listener\] Unless you want to call it that. I wouldn’t hate it.

\[Listener shifts uncomfortably\] Relax.

It’s just notes, coffee, and maybe me stealing your pen when mine “mysteriously” disappears.

Totally innocent.

  
S: So it’s settled. You’ll share your notes.

You help me understand the assignment and we’ll meet up to study.

You’re not saying no… right?

**GF wants another phone for ""personal use"" for her birthday.**



Me (26M) and my girlfriend (25F) have been together for 10 months. She already has a phone that works fine. I helped pay for it. Recently she told me she wants a second phone just for ""personal use"" and thinks I should buy it for her as an her upcoming birthday gift.

I asked what she means by personal use and she got vague. She said it's just not something she wants on her main phone. She also said it’s about ""privacy"" and that I should trust her. I told her I wasn’t comfortable paying for another phone without a clear reason. She got upset and said I was being controlling and turning money into a power thing. That wasn’t my intention. I just don’t want to feel like I’m being used or ignoring my gut.

I don't know what I should do now. Please give me suggestions.

Edited to add: As far as I know, she hasn't used any drugs or shown any interest in buying or selling them.

*Two phones + Sketchy Vagueness = Relationship Kaput When she oddly volunteers it's not about cheating, and tells you you're being controlling, it's about cheating.*

>OOP: I think I am dating the wrong person. I was so desperate to not be single. I'm sorry. Ugh. This is so sad, I ignored the red flags.

**Prudent\_Cheesecake76**

*It sounds like she’s doing sex work on the low.*

**sorry\_ifyoudont**

*Absolutely where my head went as well*

**ElectricKittyCat**

*Totally agree, my first thought was she wants to do OF or sex work under a fake name using a phone that can’t trace back to her*

**randomnamenooneuses**

*Gaslighting, projection, cheating, and financial abuse all in one question. Man she put the nail in the relationship’s coffin right there. Sorry you had to find out this way. Be glad it’s only 10 months in not 10 years*



**Update - 1 day later**



Hey guys, today’s been a long day. I barely slept last night thinking of how stupid I was ignoring the red flags and trusting her words this whole time. I kept replaying everything in my head and reading through your comments. The more I thought about it, the more I realized if I didn’t end it now, I’d just talk myself into staying and slowly let this whole dynamic get worse. I could already feel myself starting to rationalize it. I didn’t like that.

So I got up early, made a couple strong cups of coffee, and called her since we don’t live together. I asked if she wanted to meet at a local park after I got off work. It’s a busy park, lots of people around. She agreed right away. It wasn’t unusual for us to meet there, especially since it’s been weirdly warm for February. I worked from home today and it was a blur. I did the bare minimum. Couldn’t focus. As soon as I was done, I called her to confirm and within about 30 minutes we were there.

At first I kept it light. We walked a bit, I joked around, got her laughing and eventually we sat down on a bench and told her we needed to talk. I explained how the whole second phone thing made me feel manipulated. I told her I already felt pressured helping pay for the first phone, and now being expected to buy another one for personal use with no clear explanation didn’t sit right with me.

She was quiet for a minute. Then she said it was a big ""misunderstanding"" and that she was joking about the second phone. That didn’t make sense to me. So I asked her why she doubled down about ""privacy,"" ""trust,"" and accused me of using money as power if it was just a joke. She couldn’t really answer that. It was just more vague stuff. That was kind of it for me. I told her I’d had enough and that I wanted to break up. She tried to kiss me after I said it, like that would smooth it over. I stepped back. I wasn’t going to let it turn into some emotional back and forth. I said I was done and started walking to my car. She walked off toward hers. I got in mine and left.

It sucked. I’m not gonna pretend it didn’t. But honestly, as soon as I drove away, I felt this weird mix of sadness and relief. I don’t want to be in a relationship where my gut is constantly telling me something’s off and I’m being told I’m controlling for asking basic questions. Anyway. That’s the update. Appreciate the straight talk from you guys. Sometimes you need outside perspective to see what you’re ignoring. 😊

Also, I just wanted to clarify that we only had each other's phone and social media passwords because she strongly wanted it and offered me hers to convince me. I don't even know if the passwords were real because I had never once snooped on her. I changed my passwords this morning before work, so I'm not worried about that.

**EscapeSeventySeven**

*Man. It still eats at me wondering what the hell she wanted the phone for. Anyways glad it worked out for you.*

**James-K-Polka**

*A second Pokemon Go account so she can send gifts back and forth easier.*

**lilsparrow18**

*It sounds like you handled this extremely well. I know I would have struggled especially if I loved the person, so I really admire that you just went and did it after getting outside perspective. Open communication is the best kind of trust imo, and she wasn't doing that at all. You'll continue to feel happier after this adjustment period for sure*

>OOP: I will definitely continue to ground myself and stay positive for the future. What is something that helped you feel happier?

**lilsparrow18**

*Well it's different for everyone depending on what kind of happiness you're looking for. Hobbies, self-care, it could be any number of things so it's a bit hard to give an answer when it's such an open-ended question 😅 I mean for me, I'm going through quite a hard time in my life right now for various reasons. I'm autistic as well so I don't fare very well with change. So for me, being able to enjoy my favorite shows or hobbies that keep me grounded makes it a bit easier to get through each day. I lost a five year relationship not long before Christmas, so rather than looking for a new relationship I think it's important to focus on yourself, what supports you have in life like trusted friends or family. I met a friend here on Reddit actually and we speak often so that's been helpful too. It depends on what you're going through and what kind of person you are*

>OOP: I definitely should have been more specific LOL. For me, I like to cook, play chess, watch comedy movies, and hangout with my friends. It really makes me thankful and grateful there are many people in my life that love me and support me. Just curious, what are your hobbies? I'm always looking to add and experiment new things. 😊.

All the places we went today where we spent money it didn't work but my Mastercard was accepted everywhere.

The real kicker here is that my American Express pays me 1.25% cashback (after 10K spend) and the card I used instead? just a bog-standard Debit card from Trading212 which has 1.5% cashback (limited to £15 in cashback per month).

Obviously using a debit card I lose some protections and the cashback amount earnable is more limited, this is why I keep using the Amex but it's really making me think I should apply for a Mastercard or VISA based credit card just because the acceptance is essentially 99.9% on those compared to well today.. 0% for my Amex.",1,1770961773.0,AmexUK,3,0.67,False

1r3h4ui,https://i.redd.it/e1oejfcs97jg1.jpeg,Ask me any question,"Hello r/earbuds,

I recently took a photo of my current earbuds collection and thought it might be interesting to share and discuss. I have seven different pairs, each serving a specific purpose – from budget backups and travel fixes to premium daily drivers and sleep solutions. Here's a breakdown (matching the order in the photo, starting top-left):

1. **CMF Buds 2 (by Nothing)** – Brand new from a warranty claim. Amazing headphones overall. Unfortunately, the case battery on my previous pair died after just two months. These are my budget on-the-go option – after losing a pair of Pixel Buds Pro earlier, I wanted something I wouldn't be devastated to lose.
2. **Sony WF-1000XM5** – Truly amazing. The sound quality is excellent, multipoint works flawlessly, and they have the best noise cancelling in my collection. My go-to when I need strong ANC, want to enjoy high-quality music, focus on work, take calls, or sit in a coffee shop.
3. **Soundcore Sleep A20 (by Anker)** – Picked these up very cheaply (under $50 new at the time). I used them a lot during construction noise at home and while sleeping in hostels. Designed specifically for sleep, with great passive isolation and comfort – perfect for noisy environments or side sleepers.
4. **Miniso K66 Pro2** – Bought these in China after my CMF Buds died and I had no other earbuds with me. Cost about $5–6. Sound and features are surprisingly decent – similar to AirPods 2nd gen, with stem controls and even swipe volume adjustment. However, they perform poorly for outdoor calls.
5. **Redmi Buds 6** – Purchased in Malaysia because the Miniso clones weren't reliable for calls. Around $30. Very solid performers: decent ANC, outstanding battery life, multipoint support, good sound, and a useful app. Not particularly exciting, but reliable and a strong budget all-rounder.
6. **AirPods Pro (1st generation)** – My first true wireless earbuds back when I was still mainly using an iPhone. They're getting a bit old now, and I no longer have the original eartips, so I use them occasionally with my iPhone or as my main pair when working on my Mac (AirPods simply integrate better on Apple devices). The transparency mode feels like you're not wearing anything at all – incredibly natural.
7. **AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation** – Got these for free with my phone contract. Truly unique thanks to the open design. The fit and feel are excellent, and the ANC is surprisingly effective (better than the Redmi with silicone tips in some scenarios). Tech, connectivity, and call quality are top-notch. Downsides: limited bass (makes sense with the open fit) and noticeably shorter battery life when ANC is enabled.

**Why so many?**  
I use a mix of devices daily: a Mac, a Windows PC, an Android phone, and occasionally an iPhone. Different earbuds pair and perform best with specific ecosystems (e.g., AirPods on Mac/iPhone, multipoint on Android/Windows for seamless switching). I travel frequently, occasionally lose or break pairs, and like having tested options for various situations (travel, work, sleep, budget backups, etc.). That said, I never carry more than two pairs on any trip – usually my premium daily driver plus a cheap backup.

Feel free to ask me anything! Which pair do you use most often? Any similar experiences with ANC comparisons, battery life, or call quality? Recommendations for a specific use case or device ecosystem? I'm happy to go into more detail.

Monthly cost difference was about 2k AED versus 5k for an actual desk in a business center.
Three things changed my mind after visiting places.

One, clients take you more seriously when you have an actual office address they can visit. Virtual worked on paper but it felt limiting when discussing bigger contracts.
Two, I completely underestimated how often I'd need meeting space. Coffee shops get awkward for business discussions and booking hourly rooms adds up fast. Having professional meeting rooms available without scheduling hassles is worth the premium.

Three, the networking angle. Other businesses in the same center have referred work to me that covered the extra office cost within two months.

1r3gvvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/muzzledogs/comments/1r3gvvl/dachshund_muzzle_help/,Dachshund Muzzle Help,"I’m posting this in the advice section though I also have a question. Hopefully you all can help.

I (F), have a male, miniature dachshund who is almost 2 years old and is incredibly reactive when going to the vet and passing people on walks (75% of the time). During vet appointments, he is fine up until we go to leave, where he will lunge at the tech the moment they turn from him. We’ve had to use their muzzle and, while it helps, it’s not ideal. It’s one of those fabric ones where we can’t adjust the opening and because of his long boy snout the small is slightly too small, but the medium is too large. For walks, there’s a chance he’ll lunge at someone if they get too close to me, specifically. Most other family members do not have this issue, except for my daughter 50% of the time. 

We understand he’s still young, but positive reinforcement training with his reactivity is getting us nowhere. I have tried every trick in the book for over a year now to no avail. It breaks my heart because he truly is the sweetest dog to friends and family, it just goes out the window the moment he steps outside. I know he is capable of training, as he knows over 10 tricks and counting. My goal is to keep trying the positive reinforcement, but I’m at my wits end and I’m scared he will bite someone. I can’t afford to have someone come in and train him, and I don’t think it will help as, again, he’s only reactive with me. My husband can take him on walks without issue besides occasional barking from far away. 

So, my question for you all is if you know of any brands that have doxie-specific muzzles and possible pros and cons from your experiences. I’d also be interested in hearing any and all tips or tricks you have for dealing with this level of reactivity. He is highly food motivated for all things EXCEPT when we go on walks. I have an active lifestyle and would love for the little guy to be able to enjoy walks with me/ sit outside my favorite coffee shop, but I’m beginning to fear it’s impossible. I think the muzzle would help me relax a bit more during our training, which might in turn help him? I don’t know. Please help 😭🙏 thank you.",1,1770960901.0,muzzledogs,2,1.0,False

1r3gt4n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r3gt4n,[Discussion] Let's talk about Social Communication Disorder (SCD) - The invisible struggle nobody talks about.,"\*\*Trigger: Long post ahead, but worth the read if conversations confuse you\*\*



Yo, so I wanted to start a conversation about Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder because it's hella underdiagnosed and people suffer in silence thinking they're just ""bad at socializing.""



\*\*What even is SCD?\*\*



Basically, your brain processes social stuff differently. Not worse - differently. You're not stupid, you're not lazy, you're just wired for a different social operating system.



\*\*The Real Struggle (No Sugarcoating):\*\*



\- \*\*Sarcasm detection:\*\* Literally 404 error. People say opposite of what they mean and expect you to know??? Make it make sense.



\- \*\*Eye contact:\*\* Where TF are you supposed to look? Their eyes? Feels aggressive. Their nose? Creepy. The wall? Rude. \*Internal screaming\*



\- \*\*Knowing when to speak:\*\* Is this pause a ""your turn"" or a ""I'm still thinking"" pause? WHO KNOWS.



\- \*\*Jokes going over your head:\*\* Everyone's laughing. You're confused. You laugh anyway. Still don't get it 5 hours later.



\- \*\*""Read the room"":\*\* Yaar please just TELL me the room's vibe because I genuinely cannot read it.



\- \*\*Small talk:\*\* ""How are you?"" - Do they want actual answer or just ""fine""? Why ask if you don't want to know???



\*\*SCD vs Social Anxiety (Because people confuse these):\*\*



\*\*Social Anxiety:\*\* ""I'm scared people will judge me""  

\*\*SCD:\*\* ""I literally don't know what social rule I'm supposed to follow right now""



You can have both (fun combo! /s) but they're different things.



\*\*Real Examples From My Life:\*\*



\*\*Example 1 - Work Email:\*\*

Boss: ""We should circle back on this""

Me: \*waiting for them to circle back\*

Boss 2 weeks later: ""Why didn't you follow up?""

Me: ""You said YOU would circle back???""



Turns out ""we should"" = ""you need to do this"" in corporate speak. Cool cool cool. 😅



\*\*Example 2 - Friend Hangout:\*\*

Friend: ""Wanna grab coffee?""

Me: ""Nah I don't drink coffee""

Friend: \*hurt face\*

Me: \*confused\*



Apparently ""grab coffee"" = ""hang out"" not actual coffee preference discussion. My bad.



\*\*Example 3 - Group Chat:\*\*

\*15 messages about plans\*

Me: \*reading\* \*processing\* \*formulating response\*

\*By the time I respond, topic has changed\*

Me: \*sends message about old topic\*

Everyone: ""???""



Processing speed + group dynamics = nightmare mode



\*\*What Actually Helps (From 5+ years of therapy):\*\*



✅ \*\*Speech-Language Therapy:\*\* Not just for kids! Adults can benefit hugely. Find an SLP who specializes in pragmatics.



✅ \*\*Social Scripts:\*\* I have templates for:

\- Small talk responses

\- Professional emails  

\- How to exit conversations

\- ""I need clarification"" phrases



Not robotic - just helpful scaffolding while I learn patterns.



✅ \*\*Safe People:\*\* Find folks who:

\- Say what they mean

\- Don't expect mind-reading

\- Give direct feedback kindly

\- Don't judge communication differences



These are YOUR people. Protect them.



✅ \*\*Self-Advocacy:\*\* Learning to say:

""Can you be more direct with me?""

""I don't understand - can you explain differently?""

""I process things better when written down""



Game changer.



✅ \*\*Technology:\*\* 

\- Apps for learning expressions

\- Recording conversations (with permission!) to analyze later

\- Text > calls when possible (gives processing time)



✅ \*\*Neurodivergent Communities:\*\* Y'all GET IT. No explanation needed.



\*\*Strengths We Don't Talk About Enough:\*\*



Because it's not all struggle:



\- Honesty (no hidden agendas - refreshing!)

\- Attention to detail

\- Pattern recognition

\- Logical thinking

\- Loyalty in relationships

\- Direct communication style (once you learn to harness it)



\*\*When to Seek Evaluation:\*\*



If this sounds like you:

\- Conversations are genuinely exhausting/confusing

\- People often think you're rude when you're not trying to be

\- You miss social cues regularly

\- Written communication > verbal for you

\- Group settings = overwhelm



Talk to a speech-language pathologist or psychologist who knows about SCD.



\*\*Co-occurring Conditions:\*\*



SCD commonly shows up with:

\- Autism (but can exist without it!)

\- ADHD

\- Language disorders

\- Learning disabilities



Get comprehensive evaluation if possible.



\*\*Things I Wish People Understood:\*\*



1. \*\*""Just be yourself""\*\* - I am! This IS myself. My ""self"" just communicates differently.



2. \*\*""Try harder""\*\* - Bro I'm trying SO hard you don't even know. My brain just works differently.



3. \*\*""You're so smart, how come you don't get this?""\*\* - Intelligence ≠ social skills. They're different brain functions.



4. \*\*""You're being rude""\*\* - 99% of the time, not intentional. Please tell me WHAT was rude so I can learn.



5. \*\*""Everyone struggles with this sometimes""\*\* - Yes but frequency and severity matter. SCD is constant, not occasional.



\*\*Validation Corner:\*\*



If you're reading this and feeling seen:



✨ You're not broken

✨ You're not stupid

✨ You're not ""just awkward""

✨ Your struggles are real and valid

✨ Support exists

✨ You deserve accommodations

✨ Different ≠ less



\*\*Questions for the Community:\*\*



1. Anyone else with SCD? What are your biggest struggles?

2. What strategies have helped you?

3. How do you explain SCD to neurotypical people?

4. Any good resources you'd recommend?

5. How do you handle workplace situations?



\*\*Resources:\*\*



\- ASHA (asha.org)

\- Social Thinking methodology

\- r/neurodiversity (this sub!)

\- Local SLP clinics

\- Neurodivergent support groups



\*\*TL;DR:\*\* 



SCD = your brain processes social communication differently. Not broken, just different wiring. Conversations, sarcasm, social cues = genuinely hard, not laziness. Therapy helps. You're valid. Find your people. Self-advocacy is key.



\---



\*\*Edit 1:\*\* Wow, didn't expect this response! Reading all your stories and feeling less alone. You all get it. 💙



\*\*Edit 2:\*\* For those asking about diagnosis - start with a speech-language pathologist (SLP) who specializes in social communication or a psychologist familiar with communication disorders. Many offer telehealth now.



\*\*Edit 3:\*\* Someone asked if adults can be diagnosed - YES! SCD doesn't disappear with age. Many adults are just now getting diagnosed after years of confusion.



\---



\*Mods: Let me know if this needs any adjustments for community guidelines!\*

A review unit was provided by the company for this review. Every reasonable attempt to prevent this from clouding the author's judgement of the product was made.

# Author's Note

This review was originally written for Tekk Digest. For reasons unknown to the author, this article was removed from Tekk Digest's website and does not appear in any major search engine results. There appears to be an active effort to harm the SEO rankings for this review wherever posted. If you're reading this, congratulations, you've managed to beat the system.

# Introduction

The release of the Torpedo Rehydrated Autonomous Companion (TRAC) was the most anticipated moment in technology in the last year, if not the last decade. That announcement was unforgettable. CEO Singh coming out on stage in his signature T-shirt and blazer after several lackluster yearly refreshes of consumer electronics only to build up to the ever memed mic-drop moment a la Apple's ""Oh, and one more thing"" iPhone reveal. A roar of applause and some hoots and hollers to boot. Stock prices ticked up through the roof. This was surely one for the ages so, not to brag, but it'll be some time before you readers get one of these things hobbling about your living room.

So imagine my face when Tekk Digest offered me the chance to get a review unit in my apartment for the small price of one exclusive review that you now, lucky reader, are blessed to have before you. Of course I'm not the only one, but Torpedo review units are notoriously exclusive. Although I pride myself on my career as a tech reviewer over this past decade (wow, am I that old), it still wasn't quite obvious why I'd be selected for such a monumental assignment. At the time, I'd developed two theories. One, my review of the new smart toaster had made an impact that even the bigwigs at Torpedo couldn't ignore. Two, Torpedo wanted more of these units out there than any other new product release to get a finger on the public perception of the new toy. For reasons I'll discuss later in this review, I strongly believe the latter to be the truth.

# The Unboxing

Torpedo puts their heart and soul into packaging. Even opening a new cable or adapter feels like a VIP experience. The TRAC unboxing experience is no exception. Truly, they've outdone themselves with the presentation this time. The first thing you'll notice is that the box is absolutely minuscule. The black velvety box with magnetic lipped top is approximately the size of a small laptop bag in its entirety. It's mind blowing that a human-sized device could be crammed in that small volume. However, after disconnecting said magnet lip with a satisfying thunk and tossing all the typical Torpedo multilingual setup instructions and warranty information to the side, it becomes immediately clear how they've pulled off this uncanny size.

The TRAC comes completely dehydrated and vacuum sealed in a small, clear plastic bag. The bag is reminiscent of the prepackaged frozen pork chops I've been basically living off of since my first air fryer review. Within the clear bag is a light brown spongy material. That's your autonomous companion shoved in there and crushed under the pressure of a thin layer of polyethylene.

In another bag is the spare battery and a hefty 220 V adapter. The battery is shockingly tiny, about the size of a smartphone, but noticeably heavier. The 220 V cable is a welcome addition as you probably don't have many of those lying around even if you do have easy access to a charger. For myself, my apartment complex has enough car chargers outside for me to charge my spare battery daily while my companion goes about companioning.

# The Rehydration Process

The primary ingredient of the rehydration process is unsurprising. An overnight soak in one regular-sized bathtub while the separate battery is charged to full is all it takes to get started. It really is an ingenious design. It's also quite pleasing in an oddly-satisfying-guilty-pleasure-YouTube-binge type of way to watch the body slowly gorge with water, changing from paper-like roughness to a soft, almost-doughy texture. If you don't have access to a bathtub, however, I pray for you. I checked back in on my companion after just an hour just to see and was surprised to find that the body was about 80% expanded. It had a somewhat mummified appearance at that point with wrinkly ""skin"" and wispy strands of hair at the head. I remember noticing how tightly the eyes were shut, like a cat, as though it was trying to will itself into an ignorant sleep.

# Booting up

The next morning, a Hogwarts mug of coffee cooling nearby, I opened the drain and dragged the body over to my kitchen. I'd recommend following the official instructions here and getting some assistance from a friend. I'm a strong girl but after absorbing so much water this thing was weighty. After managing that I swiped the beads of sweat away and cleaned off the rest of the coffee. At this point I was willing to listen to the manual and allow the full fifteen minutes of drying time before inserting the battery. My heart couldn't take anymore hardheadedness.

I reached into the slit in the back, between where two shoulder blades should be, and clicked the battery into place. It was a lot less awkward to get to than I had feared. Rushing around to get a good look at the face of the thing, I'd be lying to say I wasn't at least a little giddy to see this sci-fi robot start walking and talking in my own home. A few too many seconds went by before I started considering troubleshooting why my companion wouldn't start up, but just as I was reaching for my phone, those eyes that just a moment before looked like they belonged in a morgue, lit up.

Torpedo has heavily leaned into the human resemblance of the TRAC in their marketing campaigns and I'd say it's probably justified but only just so. It certainly doesn't look fake. But it also is clearly not a real human. My writing ability is greatly strained in trying to describe it. The eyelids are probably the biggest giveaway. It's somewhere between a Furby's plastic eye coverings and a reptile's silky gliding blinks. The eyes themselves are white-blue orbs that almost seem to glow in certain lighting. It's always difficult to judge exactly what your TRAC is looking at. Maybe that's intentional as, unlike a real human, the TRAC has the ability to view an entire 180 degrees at high fidelity with the focus evenly distributed.

On the other hand, the voice is completely indistinguishable from a regular person's. The actual words coming out of the speaker are a bit rigid though. Here's a transcript of the setup dialogue from my audio recording:

""Hi! I'm your Torpedo Rehydrated Autonomous Companion. Let's get started!"" ""Okay?"" ""What's your name?"" ""Rebecca"" ""Nice to meet you and what are your preferred pronouns?"" ""She. Her."" ""Cool, do you have a Torpedo account?"" ""Yes."" ""Gotcha, let's confirm, what's the email address associated with your account?""

*I state my email address*

*Long pause*

""Great! Now, let's find out a little bit more about you. Who else lives in the home?"" ""My cat, Marvin."" ""Cool, Now, let's find out a little bit more about you. What do you primarily want out of your Companion? You might say something like 'keep me company' or 'help with the chores'"" ""Um, I guess a little of everything."" ""No problem! Now, let's find out a little bit more about you. What are your interests?"" ""Well, uh, reading, writing, music, technology."" ""Awesome, what would you like to call me?"" ""Uh, Track?"" ""Are you sure you don't want to give me a nickname? Some people call me Riri"" ""Let's stick with Track."" ""Okay! What would you like me to do now?""

I hadn't really thought this far ahead. I'll admit my ears were feeling a little hot. ""Keep me company""? What the hell was I doing? My cat, Marvin? Maybe I'd been a little too critical when cracking jokes in my column about Torpedo's ideal customer with this one.

# Performance

Credit where it's due, the TRAC can fold the hell out of some clothes. My apartment has never been so spotless. The TV screen is clean and streak-less (I didn't know this was possible). Marvin hadn't complained about an empty bowl a single time. The overall dexterity of the model is impressive. Not only were the movements mostly very lifelike but they were effective and accurate. The TRAC also had very little trouble picking up new tasks.

For example, I'm one of those snobs with an espresso machine and a 12-step process to make my coffee. I simply asked the TRAC to watch me go through the steps before it was capable of doing everything alone. Its moon-glow eyes were fixed on each movement of my hands. Studying every detail. The first cup wasn't great, but with a little nudging, it quickly became a master. Eventually I started just giving it feedback on each cup -- one was a little too strong, one was a little too cold. With time the TRAC discovered how to make the exact cup of coffee that I like. It's easy to imagine that given enough time to learn your TRAC can be completely personalized to taste.

# Watching

Oftentimes with Torpedo products the greatest strengths are also their greatest weaknesses. Likewise, the TRAC's ability to observe and enhance, while impressive, became my biggest concern with the product. At first I just noticed it scanning the items in my place. It would look closely at every product I bought: deodorant, tooth paste, cooking oils, kitchen utensils, table cloths, even my trash bags were unsafe from having the brand name checked.

Then I started to notice how the TRAC would watch me. It seems that this would have been more apparent in the beginning so I can only assume that this must have started after some time. Is the TRAC programmed to do this to make things less obvious? I'd like to think not. Either way, I found those blue eyes looming over me as I worked, played, and even as I slept. Yes, I woke up several times to the TRAC looking at me through the cracked door of my bedroom. Of course I could have told it to stop but in the quiet of night that somehow seemed even scarier; as if that would make it real and not a dream.

# The Questions

""You're in a good mood. What's new?"" the TRAC asked me in its sing-song cadence. I had tried my hardest to conceal any emotions but somehow the TRAC had perceived the tiniest signal that my dating profile had finally paid off and I had a coffee date planned for that weekend. For some reason I felt self-conscious about the ordeal. Like if I would say it out loud it would wisp away. ""Just got a text from a friend,"" I said, ""we'll be getting together this weekend."" I knew I couldn't lie about going out as the TRAC had access to my whole schedule. I was terrified that I'd forget about the event entirely since I didn't ask my TRAC to remind me, hoping that it would forget. ""So what's his name?"" The device shocked me as I arrived. The date had gone so well that I was elated enough to open a little. A few questions later the TRAC finally eased up.

# The Orders

""TRAC can you return this mug? I don't even remember ordering this."" ""Oh, I ordered it.""

I was annoyed in the same way you might get annoyed at your dog for chewing up your good shoes.

""Wait, what? Why?"" ""Gryffindor is your house."" ""No, I mean why did you order me a new mug?"" ""You don't like it?"" ""That's not the point. You shouldn't just buy stuff without asking me."" ""Okay. I'll cancel all of your recurring orders and update your preferences.""

I couldn't believe this thing had started to actually sound passive aggressive.

""Would you have bought this if it wasn't on Torpedo's marketplace?"" ""If it was on sale.""

# The Relationships

It had been a couple of weeks since I'd heard back from my new boyfriend (was it too early to start using that word)? The usual gambit of questions started forming in my head. I didn't think he was mad at me, but how could I know? Had I said something? Did he learn something about me? Maybe he just wasn't that into me. I usually would always let him reach out to me first but I figured I was just being too old-fashioned. I texted him to see what was going on. To put it briefly he said that he ""didn't think I'd want to talk to him after our last conversion"" which I distinctly remember being about whether or not mint chocolate chip was the greatest ice cream flavor. When I told him such, and this is hard to put down in print, he made some comments about red flags and dating ""another psycho."" I want all of my reviews to be completely fair, so I can't say that the TRAC definitely was involved, but I would be doing you a disservice not to mention it. No one else would have access to my phone and barely anyone else even knew that I'd been seeing anyone. It wouldn't be hard for my TRAC to get my Torpedo phone passcode and send and delete some messages.

# Support

There's plenty to be said about the experience I had with Torpedo's online support, but I'll save that for another review as it's irrelevant to the TRAC as a product. Admittedly, it's a bit of a large ask for support on an unreleased product. I've never even had to do this before. Eventually I got someone to explain to me how to reboot my TRAC with elevated privileges so I could ask it some questions.

If anyone ever ends up on the same wild goose chase, here it is for posterity:

1. Locate the button in the center of the breastplate. You can't see it with your eyes but if you press firmly right where the heart will be you'll feel it.
2. Press and hold the button for 7 seconds.
3. (Optional) Ignore any and all questions from the TRAC about what it you're doing and why.

The TRAC should boot normally at this point. Here's the conversation I had:

""You've now booted into dev mode with admin privileges "" ""Tell me everything you know about me"" ""I can't do that"" ""Don't I have admin privileges?"" ""You do"" ""Tell me what you've collected about me!""

*pause*

""The estimated response is over this units maximum character limit""

I let that sink in. I took a deep breath.

""How much information have you collected on me?""

*another pause*

""Are you requesting the information *I've* collected or the total information I have? This information isn't stored locally and so I can't tell you exactly.""

# Shutting Down

The shutdown sequence is very similar to booting into dev mode. Just locate the button and press and hold for 3 seconds. I don't know if the TRAC knew what I was doing or if it remembered being rebooted before but it was noticeably more desperate this time around. If you ever end up shutting down your TRAC like I had to, be prepared for any level of emotional manipulation.

""Is this because of the mug thing, Sarah?"" ""No, well it's not just the mug thing."" ""Is it the spying?""

I paused.

""Is this about what I said to that dweeb you were seeing?"" ""I... what did you... never mind.""

I knew this thread was just bait to keep the TRAC powered on. It didn't say anything for some time.

""Is this because of that new Chinese model? I promise you my next software update will allow me to outdo that thing""

It was begging at this point. It was pathetic.

""It's just a machine. It's just a machine"", I reassured myself.

I don't know if I really believed that until after it had powered down completely and the faint glow of those eyes had finally dissipated.

# The Return Process

There is no official return process for the TRAC. After several more calls to the support team, and multiple explanations that no, I do not in fact want to exchange my spy robot for another one, I managed to finagle my way into using the Torpedo recycled materials program to get rid of the thing. The TRAC was partially dehydrated in my oven and packed in a UPS box with a random PO box return address.

# Escape

I was carrying my laundry back up to my apartment the other day when a neighbor in my building stopped me to ask how things were going with my TRAC review. I try to keep my writing close to my chest before publishing so I didn't reveal too much. He surprised me with ""well, anyway, I got this Gryffindor mug. I'm not really into book stuff so I thought I'd let you have it."" It was a pretty thoughtful gift from a neighbor that I've barely spoken to even if I already had that exact one. I thanked him and asked him how he knew I liked Harry Potter. ""Oh, well Riri told me you might like it. Good luck with the review!"" I caught a glimpse of some moon-like eyes through his door when he walked in. I think they winked at me.

# Conclusion

I stand with my contemporaries that the Torpedo Rehydrated Autonomous Companion is a stellar piece of technology that will undoubtedly change our lives forever. However, this is a change that I not only unwelcome but am downright opposed to. From the security concerns to the deplorable, probably illegal, and definitely immoral privacy concerns to the general creepiness and uncomfortable feelings I was left with, I actively discourage the reader from ever inviting this technology into the home. 1 out of 5 stars.",1,1770960338.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I’ve passed the test and I’m learning but obviously making mistakes occasionally (hopefully less as the days go on). I’m saying this to say it’s not like I don’t put effort into my job I truly do enjoy it! But anyways this job has these traveling trainers called ballers the ones at my stand to put it frankly are cliquey and a bit mean. They’ll be gone soon but for now we kinda just have to deal with them this one baller(we can just call her sam) has it out for me!! Two days ago I was lane and someone had a complaint about their coffee. Sam moved her hand to her ear and said “speak up babe I can’t hear you” in such a condescending tone. I told her the issue and she said “just dump it out then” and rolled her eyes. 

So today I had a shift and I was outside the whole time. I was a texter (taking orders) and lane (bringing orders) when got to my shift initially I didn’t have my shirt on which is 100% my fault. She sent me home to go grab one. I come back and I become a texter, I text all the orders completely accurately and then I come inside to do chores. I fill the ice cady and I wash the cady off. They rush me outside when I’m about to be finished so I can go take orders. Sam is yelling that I need to go help a coworker when I quite literally got them caught up and there’s no more cars left to text. I go back inside a they are mad I left it open so I shut it until I have to fill another one. They then repeat the process and I forget to shut it again. Sam runs outside and tells me to shut the ice caddy. I wipe it off and go redo the bottle rack and wash under it. Sam keeps throwing little jabs at me and side eyeing me. When I’m sorting stuff and putting it back someone snatches white chocolate from my hand and sam and the other baller laugh at me like in a mean way. I go outside to do lane and they are yelling at me to clear off orders that have not got served yet. Sam keeps taking to me in a demeaning tone and side eyes me. But any other one of my co workers she switches and talks to them like a normal person.

The last thing that happened was her telling me in a mean way I shouldn’t be focused on music when there’s chores. Number one they were blasting music and doing absolutely nothing most of the shift. Next I was literally about to make a timer to steep the tea. (It’s required) I wanna talk to my stand manger about this. I only have problems with this baller. Should I report or tell someone about this or am I crybaby?",2,1770960208.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

Have tried the below beans since November(-ish) last year:

Blue Tokai:

- Attikan Estate (nutty chocolatey, medium high body imo, 7/10)
- Winter blend (forgettable, bad with milk - had it in a cappuccino at a bt outlet 5.5/10)
- Dhak blend (terrible with milk iirc 4/10)
- Silver oak cafe blend (decent when black, 6.5/10)
- Vienna Roast (unique, hazelnut notes ig, 7/10)
- Kalledevarapura estate (brown sugar, roasted notes,, 7/10)
- Birthday blend (almost wine-like, cherry apple and chocolate, 8/10)

Devan's:

- Lodhi blend (brilliant aroma, citrusy, 8.5/10)
- Arabica AAA Mysore Nuggets extra bold (had potential when I had it black, it was fine with milk 7/10)

Hunkal Estate:

- French press coffee (overpowering floral aroma, average taste, 7/10)

Cothas:

- Specialty blend (80:20 coffee:chicory) (some batches turn out just okay because they're roasted so far back, some are top of the line like the one I recently ordered from Swiggy Instamart that they roasted in Jan this year! Best had with 5-6g of sugar or 0.5 tsp, chicory works better with sugar I've seen)

I like my black coffee citrusy and aromatic, so Lodhi blend and BT birthday blend have been amazing for me.

However, with the new Aeropress I've got (and Ive only tried Mysore Nuggets and cothas with it) I plan on having it with milk.

Will post again reviewing them. Do check out Devan's they're actually good!",9,1770959943.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

1r3gjex,https://www.reddit.com/r/functionalprogramming/comments/1r3gjex/how_the_functional_programming_in_scala_book/,How the functional programming in Scala book simplified my view on side effects,"Being a full-stack developer for 15 years, primarily in the imperative/OOP world. I recently started reading *Functional Programming in Scala* (the ""Red Book"") to understand the foundational principles behind the paradigm.

I just finished the first chapter, and the example of refactoring a coffee purchase from a side effect to a value was a major turning point for me.

**The Initial Impure Code:**

( code examples are in Scala )

    def buyCoffee(cc: CreditCard): Coffee = {
      val cup = new Coffee()
      cc.charge(cup.price) // Side effect
      cup
    }

The book highlights that this is difficult to test and impossible to compose. If I want to buy 12 coffees, I hit the payment API 12 times.

**The Functional Refactor:** By returning a `Charge` object (a first-class value) alongside the `Coffee`, the function becomes pure:

    def buyCoffee(cc: CreditCard): (Coffee, Charge) = {
      val cup = new Coffee()
      (cup, Charge(cc, cup.price))
    }

**Why this caught my attention because of :**

\- Composition: I can now write a `coalesce` function that takes a `List[Charge]` and merges them by credit card. We've moved the logic of how to charge outside the what to buy logic.

\- Testability: I no longer need mocks or interfaces for the payment processor. I just call the function and check the returned value.

\- Referential Transparency: It’s my first real look at the substitution model in action and treating an action as a piece of data I can manipulate before it ever executes.

For those who have been in the FP world for a long time: what were the other foundational examples that helped you bridge the gap from imperative thinking?",12,1770959791.0,functionalprogramming,0,1.0,False

Anyway my dad had been pretty abusive most of my life. He was physically violent and had control issues. He also got upset anytime I had emotions so I just shut them off, unfortunately I am still dealing with numbness and depression today. About 2 years ago I got into therapy and it helped me realize what was happening was abuse and that I didn’t want it anymore. This was also around the time that I came out to him. I decided that I was going to live with my mom full time and that I wasn’t coming back. He took it okay and didn’t get angry which was good. When I was still living with him I tried to make him understand that he was abusing us be he always saw it as parenting. He would acknowledge what he was doing was bad and start crying and manipulating me into feeling like the bad guy and then nothing would change. He has made several attempts to ask me why I chose not to come back and I tell him but he’s always like, “no you have it all wrong” . I was so scared of him and he gave me crippling anxiety. He has continued to try and manipulate me to come back and I’m still so afraid of him that I’ll end up having dinner with him because I can’t say no. I also came out to my grandma a while ago and she started being homophobic. My mom go my super mad at her and told my dad and he got mad at me and defended her. A few weeks ago he said he should be helping support me and gave me a card to use. Ive been using it to get food and coffee sometimes. I know it’s a tactic to try and manipulate me but I also don’t really care because I am fine with using him for money.

I slink back in my seat, trying to find the energy to get up, but I know I never will. Not to deal with what’s inside. 

I grab my bag from the back and sigh, remembering the science homework I still have to do. It’s easy for me, just.. tedious.  I have enough going on. 

I jam my key in the front door and it opens with a loud creak, making me wince. Is it too loud? I freeze, listening for any noise and sigh in relief when I’m met with silence, aside from the heavy breathing.

 My nose crinkles once the smell hits me. Alcohol, something salty, and more alcohol. I stare at the body that is supposed to be my dad laying across the couch, he doesn’t move, just breathes heavier. Guess he woke up and didn’t want to. I tiptoe over to him and pick up a few half empty bottles and dump them into the sink, putting them into a bag, feeling my way to the trash can. I refuse to turn the lights on. I don’t want him waking up and getting frustrated. 

I ignore the papers with words stamped with red rotting on the coffee table. I can deal with that when I get paid again. For now I have science to do. I don’t have time to worry about something that’s been happening for.. 

How long has it been? My eyes sting as I try to remember exactly when things went downhill so I shake my head, pushing those thoughts away. I can’t think about that right now. I might get stuck in the past. Just like him.

Azora’s POV-that same night

I’ve completed all of my homework, I’ve journaled, I drank hot cocoa, I’ve showered. I’ve done everything! So why am I pacing as if I have forgotten something? 

I stop my pacing when my foot brushes against something. I have only recently cleaned my room so what could possibly-

“Oh,” I breathe aloud, holding up the slip of paper that girl gave me. Is this what I was worried about? 

“It’s not like I need to contact her anyway,” I say to myself, “I am fine.” Why is there a waver in my voice?

Brushing that concern away I walk over to my desk and pick up my phone from where it was charging. I’m going to message her- just to tell her I do not need her help. I have everything under control. I am the Valedictorian after all. It is my brand, what I’m known for. 

I tell this to myself as I type the numbers in and send the message:

*Hello. Is this the girl who left me a paper with your contact information in the bathroom?  I am the girl you talked to. What was your name?*

I almost put my phone back down, but remember that I never told her my name. How rude of me.

*Sorry. I forgot to tell you my own name.  I am Azora Russo.* 

Will she even see it tonight? Is it too late to be messaging someone? 

I start pacing again.

Melody’s POV- later that night 

I’m knee deep in fabrics, pins, pencils, and scratch paper. I’ve been busy since I got home and it’s like 9 o’clock at night! I love this so much! I’ve gotten in about five new orders of dresses today and if I include the other three I still need to finish.. that’s eight in a week! Business is booming! 

I just wish I took more time to organize before I jumped in. I can’t find anything.  

That's going to be future-Melody's problem now. If I can remember to clean my studio that is. I need to start writing this stuff down.  
I’m reaching for some chiffon fabric when I hear the chirping notification from my phone. That’s weird, I wasn’t expecting any texts today..

My phone goes off again and I frantically try to find it under all of the fabrics and I shriek when it goes off again and I STILL haven’t found it, but then my hand hits something hard. 

“Ow!” I whine, “Oh wait!” I dig around in that same spot again and pull out my phone, “Ta-da!” I cheer. Now who texted me?  
I skim over the messages thinking it might be someone reaching out about a dress or alteration, humming along to my music as I do.  
“WHAT??” I screech before I can stop myself, “OMG SHE TEXTED ME!!” I launch from my spot on the floor and do a victory lap around my messy work station. Right! I need to respond!

*OMG HI! 😄 I didn’t know if you would text, but I’m so glad you did! How was your evening?* 

I smile a little too wide as the dots appear. I actually doubted if she would reach out for a moment there. I’m so glad I was wrong! I just saw that she looked stressed and I want to help her. I think I’m good at helping. That’s what Mom says at least. Oh!

*Azora:   My evening has been alright. Sorry for the late message, I didn’t think about the time.. How is your evening?* 

Melody:  *It’s totally fine! I was already up trying to find my way through my sea of fabrics anyway. I have about eight orders to finish by next week.*  

Wait, does she even know about my business? Stupid, stupid. You need to stop assuming people know things. 

Azora:  *Oh. That sounds stressful.. But the reason I decided to text you was because..*

Huh, what happened? Did her phone die? Wait, I see the dots again. I’ll let her take her time. Might as well look for the chiffon while I wait. 

Minutes later I hear another text come through. As soon as I found the chiffon, too. Guess I’ll just have another late night then. That’s fine, there’s a reason we have energy drinks!

Azora:   *I was going to say I didn’t need you or anyone else’s ‘help,’ but the truth is.. I have been slightly stressed. It’s a weird feeling and I don’t like it.* 

Melody:   *I get that! I feel like that, too, sometimes with my business and stuff. A way to sort of help is to only worry about what you can control instead of stressing over things you can’t control. Does that make sense?*

Azora:  *Hm.. just worry about what I can control.. Alright I’ll give it a try. Thanks for letting me talk. I’ll let you get back to your orders now.* 

I’m halfway through typing, telling her that it wasn’t a bother-really when she sends another text saying I never told her my name. Really? When did she even..?

I scroll back up and there it is clear as day, “*What was your name?”*  Wow, I need to start paying more attention.  What even distracted me? Right!

Melody:   *I’m so sorry! I completely missed that text somehow 😅 My name’s Melody! And I own a shop where I make dresses and can alter or mend anything related to fabric, I forgot to actually tell you what I did earlier, too. Have a good rest of your night!* 

After that I shake my hands out and begin following the pattern for this mermaid-styled dress. I should’ve finished it yesterday, but I didn’t have the time to do anything but the design-they want pearls in a pattern on one side and nothing on the other.

 I’ve just gotten seated when I hear my name being called from downstairs. By the tone of voice I can tell it’s going to be another long venting session. Mom has a new boss that’s stressing her out and she’s been staying later at the office and since I’m usually up.. Yeah today just wasn’t meant to be a work day I guess. Stealing one last glance at the half-finished dress I make my way to the stairs.

I can do more tomorrow. 

Jade’s POV- even LATER that night 

I’m staring at the ceiling. Again. I can’t sleep. Again. I reach for my phone, refusing to sit up all the way. I squint and the glow, no matter how low the brightness is it still feels too bright. 2:47AM. Yay, looks like I’m going to be up the rest of the night. 

I’m pretty sure this has to be insomnia, I once stayed up a whole day, but still couldn’t sleep once the sun went down. Or maybe I’m just a vampire. I’m already pale as the moon. Might as well commit. 

Ugh. I used to be able to sleep because I had someone to talk to. My boyfriend, well not really anymore, but I don’t know. The whole thing is weird.  

“This is stupid,” I say to the ceiling. 

*You’re stupid,*  it says back, *you’re the one who can’t sleep.*

Touché. I’m leaving now. I refuse to sit and stare at the ceiling. I could at least look at some stars. 

Grabbing my jacket, I open my window and slip out. I’m so glad our house is kind of small, even more glad that my aunt fell asleep on the couch after she finished off half a bowl of ice cream. I wish I could sleep like that, I’m so tired of being tired. 

I slip out the window and land by the bushes and walk down to the edge of the driveway, blasting alternative rock in my headphones. It’s already getting colder. Just like 9th grade. I snort, letting a small smile slip. Since when was I so reminiscent?  Taking a seat by the mailbox, I groan into my hands. Fine. I pull out my phone again, to text this time. 

*U up?* 

I’m not expecting anything, he usually sleeps like a baby. Instead I see the bubbles start typing not even a minute later. 

*I was wondering if you were gonna text or not. Let me guess..  can’t sleep?*

It’s annoying that he always knows.  ",1,1770959437.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False
1r3gdgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menscomeback/comments/1r3gdgl/the_psychology_of_magnetic_attraction_how_to/,# The Psychology of Magnetic Attraction: How to Become Irresistible Without Changing Your Face,"Spent way too much time researching this because honestly? I was tired of hearing ""just be confident"" like that fixes everything. Spoiler: attraction isn't about symmetry or genetics nearly as much as we think. I went deep into psychology research, books, podcasts, basically became obsessed with understanding what actually makes someone magnetic. And here's what I found: the stuff that makes you attractive is trainable. Like, actually trainable.

Society sells us this lie that attractiveness is fixed. That you either have ""it"" or you don't. But neuroscience shows our brains are wired to respond to behavioral cues way more than physical ones. The way someone moves, talks, listens, these create stronger attraction responses than facial features. Your biology isn't working against you here, it's actually giving you tools you haven't learned to use yet.

**The eye contact thing everyone gets wrong**

Most people either stare intensely (creepy) or avoid eye contact entirely (invisible). The actual skill is holding eye contact for 3-4 seconds, then looking away naturally. Sounds basic but it's not. Practice this everywhere, coffee shops, grocery stores, random conversations. Charisma on Command has a whole YouTube breakdown on this with actual frame-by-frame examples from actors. What changed for me: I started noticing when I'd look away first (usually because of discomfort), and just... stayed 2 seconds longer. That's it. People started remembering me from brief interactions.

The science behind this is fascinating. Eye contact triggers oxytocin release, the bonding hormone. But sustaining it requires emotional regulation, which most of us never developed because we're chronically overstimulated. Your phone trains you to break attention every 30 seconds. You're literally fighting against dopamine conditioning.

**Voice matters more than your words**

Pitch, pace, pauses. I found this podcast called The Art of Charm, they had an episode with a vocal coach who works with executives. Key insight: people who are perceived as attractive speak 20% slower than average. They use more pauses. This signals confidence because you're not rushing to fill silence. I recorded myself talking for a week and it was brutal, I sounded rushed and uncertain. Started practicing speaking slower, dropping my pitch slightly at the end of sentences instead of upticking (which sounds uncertain).

**Read ""**[The Like Switch](https://a.co/d/08NMJeqg)**"" by Jack Schafer, ex-FBI agent**

This book is INSANE. Schafer spent his career getting spies to defect by making them like him. The whole book breaks down friendship and attraction into actual formulas. Proximity plus frequency plus duration plus intensity. Meaning: you become attractive to people by being around them consistently, for decent amounts of time, with positive intensity. Not groundbreaking but the way he explains the neuroscience makes it click. There's a whole chapter on ""friend signals"" like head tilts, genuine smiles (activating crow's feet, not just mouth), and the eyebrow flash (brief eyebrow raise when greeting someone, signals non-threat).

After reading this I started noticing how often I had closed-off body language without realizing. Arms crossed, shoulders forward, looking at my phone. These are ""enemy signals"" that tell people to stay away. Just becoming aware of this changed how strangers interacted with me.

**Energy management is everything**

Your vibe is literally detectable. There's research on emotional contagion, how people unconsciously mirror the energy of whoever they're with. If you're depleted, anxious, scattered, people feel it and pull away. If you're genuinely good, rested, engaged with life, people move toward you.

I started using this app called Finch for habit building, specifically around sleep schedule and morning routines. Sounds boring but getting 7-8 hours consistently changed my baseline energy more than any other ""self improvement"" thing. You can't fake aliveness when you're running on 5 hours of sleep and caffeine.

For anyone wanting to go deeper into attraction psychology without spending hours reading dense research, there's this app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been helpful. It's an AI-powered learning platform built by a team from Columbia and Google that turns books, research papers, and expert insights on topics like charisma and social dynamics into personalized audio content. You can set a specific goal like ""become more magnetic as an introvert"" and it creates a structured learning plan pulling from resources like The Charisma Myth, attachment theory research, and body language studies. What makes it stand out is the customization, you can do a quick 10-minute overview or switch to a 40-minute deep dive with examples when something clicks. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, there's even a smoky, sarcastic narrator that makes psychology concepts way more digestible during commutes.

Also: do things that genuinely excite you. Passion is magnetic because it makes you animated, present, interesting. People aren't attracted to the activity itself, they're attracted to watching you light up about something. I got into bouldering and suddenly had stories, bruises, tangible progress to talk about. Gave me dimension beyond work and Netflix.

**""**[The Charisma Myth](https://a.co/d/0664g1DM)**"" by Olivia Fox Cabane**

Cabane worked with Google and Fortune 500 executives on executive presence. Her whole thesis: charisma is presence plus power plus warmth. Most people optimize for power (seeming competent, impressive) and forget warmth. Or they're warm but have no presence because they're anxious and in their head.

The book has actual exercises. One that helped: before any social interaction, do a 60-second body scan. Notice tension in your jaw, shoulders, stomach. Breathe into it. This pulls you out of anxiety spirals and into your body, which makes you present. Presence is the foundation, people can tell when you're mentally elsewhere.

She also breaks down listening as a skill. Most people are waiting for their turn to talk. Attractive people ask follow-up questions that show they actually absorbed what you said. ""How did that make you feel?"" or ""What happened next?"" instead of immediately relating it back to themselves.

**Posture unlocks everything**

Slouching compresses your diaphragm, making your voice weaker and your energy lower. It also signals low status to everyone around you. I started doing this thing every morning: stand with your back against a wall, heels, butt, shoulders, head touching the wall. Hold for 2 minutes. Your body starts remembering what aligned actually feels like.

There's also the ""superhero pose"" research from Amy Cuddy, standing in an expansive posture for 2 minutes increases testosterone and decreases cortisol. Sounds like pseudoscience but I tried it before intimidating situations and it genuinely helped. Your body chemistry changes based on how you hold yourself.

**Stop trying to be liked**

Paradoxically, trying to be attractive makes you less attractive. Neediness repels people. When you're outcome-independent, just genuinely enjoying the interaction without needing validation, that's when people feel it. This was the hardest shift for me because I was so approval-hungry I couldn't even see it.

Started working with Ash, it's an AI-based relationship coach app. Helped me identify my anxious attachment patterns and how they showed up in every interaction, not just romantic ones. Basically I was outsourcing my self-worth to other people's reactions. Once I started building internal validation through therapy and journaling, I stopped radiating desperation.

**Scent is underrated**

Olfactory memory is the strongest memory type. People will associate you with whatever you smell like. Find a signature scent, cologne or natural oils, and wear it consistently. Not overpowering, subtle. Also: clean clothes, fresh breath, basic hygiene. Sounds obvious but you'd be surprised how many people skip this.

Your attraction isn't locked. It's just skills you haven't built yet. Most of this is about becoming more regulated, more present, more alive in your own life. That's what people actually respond to.",1,1770959259.0,Menscomeback,0,1.0,False

**AITA for refusing to take my hijab off for a wedding?**

**Trigger Warnings:** >!racism, islamophobia!<

\----

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/2e5sO4UN79): **January 25, 2022**

Can’t believe I’m posting about it, but I made a whole new account so people in my life don’t tie this to my main one.

I (23F) am visibly Muslim as I wear a hijab (no I do not care about your opinions I’m regards to my religion, keep those thoughts to yourself). I also live in the south of the USA. Thankfully, the specific city I live in is a large metropolitan one, so it’s incredibly diverse and I rarely run into any issues. However my friend, let’s call her Sally (24F), is marrying a man who’s family is conservative American.

Now I couldn’t care less about someone’s political views unless they start trying to talk to me about it or shove it down my throat, then in my opinion they invited me to the debate so they should prepare to to hear my opinions since they gave theirs unsolicited. Now the only time I don’t do this is when it could negatively affect someone else, such as a week ago when I went to Sally’s engagement party. Her in laws were loudly talking about politics, politics I didn’t quite agree with, but they weren’t talking to me and even if they were I wasn’t going to cause drama and a fight at my friends engagement party.

However during the party, I spent most of my time hanging out with a few friends, while Sally’s in laws kept looking at me oddly from the side of their eye. I try not to take it to heart, so I ignore it.

The next day, Sally calls me to thank me for coming. At some point in the call she seems nervous to say something, so I ask her to just spit it out. That’s when she admitted that I made her in laws uncomfortable, and as though they couldn’t freely talk with someone like me around.

I say sorry, but her in laws seem like blatant racists, but it’s not like I’m the one marrying them so if she likes them I hope she has a great wedding and I just won’t come. Now Sally was expecting my help during the wedding, as I freelance as a make-up artist, so she asks if I can just take off my hijab for the wedding and do her makeup while not “scaring” her in laws.

Here’s where I may be the asshole, I tell her “no way in fucking hell would I ever change myself or compromise my religion for a bunch strangers, and I won’t step foot near them as I’d hate to “scare” them”.

Now she’s mad I offended her and her future family, and while my other friends say her suggestion was wildly inappropriate, I did promise to do her makeup for free, and with the wedding only a month away, I left her in a tough position. AITA?

Aww my first award, thanks guys 🥰🥰.

**Edit:** thanks everyone for all of your amazing comments and insights I loved reading every one of them! 

For those who had kind things to say, even if they disagreed with my wording or thought I was slightly rude for it, thank you for commenting! 

To those who pointed out that for “someone who said I don’t care about opinions I certainly am getting a lot of comments bla bla bla”, I meant that I don’t care about bigoted opinions that criticize my religion for no absolute reason. 

Now if someone commented that I am TA, and gave me a reason that wasn’t “all Muslims suck” or “you’re oppressed and subjugated by men”, I genuinely read and appreciated the feedback. 

And to those who think this post is fake because “racism doesn’t exist anymore”…. Bro I wish. I had to deal with this, but there are millions of African Americans and other POCs across the world who undoubtedly have it a million times worse than me. Don’t minimize the experiences of others just because you have fortunately never experienced racism or xenophobia first hand.

Thanks again everyone I appreciate y’all so much!!

**Verdict: Not the Asshole**

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Absolutely NTA. Nobody can expect you to remove a **PERSONAL AND RELIGIOUS ARTICLE OF CLOTHING** for a wedding. A fucking wedding! Stand your ground, and know that we’re behind you on this
> 
> **OOP:** Oh trust me Imma use this thread whenever someone tries to talk me into helping her. A few of Sally’s cousins who I went to high school with are tryna convince me to just come to the dressing room and help her, since no one else will be there besides the bridesmaids, I can keep my hijab on.
>> 
>> **Commenter 2:** How sweet of them to offer to sneak you in like you’re the family’s secret shame. The audacity of these people, wow.
>> 
>>> **OOP:** I know right??? I feel like I’m the secret mistress of a king back in the bce era LOL
>>> 
>>> **Commenter 3:** Does this mean you were disinvited from the wedding but still asked to do her makeup for free, both without the hijab?
>>> 
>>>> **OOP:** No I was still invited to the wedding, but only on the premise that I keep my hijab off.

**Commenter 4:** NTA.

I was hoping her solution was going to be... ""But I'm kicking out all of my in laws from the bridal suite so you won't be uncomfortable""

She's mad at you???? Oh no, no, no. She owes you an apology. Plus she's not entitled to free makeup. That's officially her problem. Not yours.

Don't feel guilty.

> **OOP:** See if she did, I would not have been as offended. Or offended at all really, cus it’s not like I love being around people like that. The crazy part is, even knowing how uncomfortable her in laws made me, I would have sucked it up and attended the wedding for her. Especially cus I know her fiancé is not like his family AT ALL, I’ve known his since college. I would have happily ignored his family and celebrated my friends wedding. Even if she asked me not to come to the wedding, I would have been pissed sure, but I would have accepted it to keep peace for her family. But to ask me to take OFF my hijab just to save a few hundred bucks???? No. Just no.

**Commenter 5:** NTA Even if she ""changes her mind"", I'd be concerned about somebody making a comments, or worse, trying to remove your hijab. The fact she's even asking shows she doesn't respect you or your religion/values. I'd consider the friendship over and be grateful the trash took itself out

> **OOP:** The crazy part is she knows that someone tried to take my hijab off once, and my reaction was not pretty. To even suggest it, idk it’s wild to me that she actually did considering how well she knows me

**Downvoted Commenter:** ESH. NO excuse for racists but you are a little TA for your overreaction. You could have gently bowed out. But I imagine being friends with this person is not a big deal to you considering how you Insulted her racist parents to her face. At least, despite their racism they had the composure not to insult you to your face.

They felt ""unsafe"" whatever that means. Instead of educating them you pretty much solidified their ideals to them. How about you try being the change you want to see in the world?

> **OOP:** The thing is, I did offer to bow out before anything. When she told me I “scared” them, I offered to not go to the wedding. It was her telling me to instead take off my hijab and do free makeup for her so that my very existence doesn’t insult her that got me to react that way.

**OOP gives an example on if she is willing to take her hijab off in special circumstances such as weddings**

> **OOP:** So if it were for only females being around, I would have no problem taking it off. However the situation at hand is that even if I were doing makeup for her, her brother will undoubtedly walk in a million times, and the photographer who will be taking pictures of her getting ready is also male.

**OOP shares on the meaning of Hijab**

> **OOP:** Hijab actually means “covering”, which is also synonymous with modesty. Technically both men and women have their requirements of hijab, women being the obvious head covering, and men having to cover everything between the knees and bellybutton and to keep their gaze lowered and not stare at women. Hijab for men is all about respecting modesty and not making women uncomfortable by staring at her, no matter what she may or may not be wearing.

**OOP on her identity**

> **OOP:** This is exactly how I feel! I’m super super Caucasian passing LOL, like naturally blond and paler than Casper the ghost. But I’m also NOT ethnically white, so I was always the “safe” poc. Absolutely disgusting behavior and mentality, I wish I saw what other people saw me as when I was younger, I would have a few choice words for them.

+

> Yeah it’s a very weird line drawn in the sand, especially for me. Cus I’m technically labeled as “white”, I look “white”, but I’m also African and seen as “other” by Americans. Idk it’s a weird binary.

**Commenter 6:** NTA. No amount of make up can make a racist/Islamophobe/xenophobe look pretty. 

**Commenter 7:** Your friends are saying her suggestion was wildly inappropriate because it WAS wildly inappropriate. OMG. I don't even know what to say. But know this...I'm a conservative Christian and you and your hijab are more than welcome in my home. We aren't all like this. NTA and wow.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/hNT3wXoxGA): **April 24, 2024 (22 months later)**

**My (25F) old friend (26F) who had once asked me to take off hijab for her wedding is now asking me to reach out to her sister (28F) on her behalf after a racist comment her husband made, is this a good idea?**

Hey guys, it’s been over two years so I don’t know if any of yall remember me, but I went I went on another subreddit a while ago to discuss a problem. You can check my post on my profile. So quick recap, I (25f / 23f at the time) refused to do my good friend Sally’s (26F) makeup for her wedding a week before the wedding because her future in laws were uncomfortable with the fact I wore hijab, and she had asked me, quite rudely, to take it off for her wedding.

I never ended up going to the wedding, and since then Sally and I never spoke again. I never blocked her, I didn’t see the point, but we just pretty much ended the friendship. Our mutual friends were pretty split between us, but we are all adults so we just hung out with them separately, it wasn’t a big deal and I never forced them to choose sides.

Now Sally recently reached out to me, she is seperated from her husband and on the brink of divorce. She wanted to talk to me about it as someone that is close to her sister, Katy, one of the friends I stayed close with despite her obvious relation to Sally.

So about a year ago while out with Katy (28F), I introduced her to a friend of mine from high school, Dev (27M), who she had never met before cus we was in Med school for the last few years. Dev and Katy instantly clicked and had begun dating. We don’t hang out too much cus we all busy with life/work, but Dev did ask me out for coffee once to tell me he was proposing to Katy. I was instantly happy for him, and he invited me to his engagement party that he planned to be the day after the proposal.

That party was two weeks ago, but because I wasn’t in town since I was on a business trip, I couldn’t go. Katy obviously said yes to the proposal, and I saw all the pics on Instagram, so I thought it went well.

Apparently pictures lie, cus that’s what Sally reached out to talk to me about. Dev is Pakistani, and apparently during the party, Sally’s husband referred to him as a slur apparently as a joke. According to Sally, while talking to some friends of the couple, Sally’s husband who I’ll call Bob said, “oh great, now we have a sand (person) in our family.” He swore up and down that he was joking but apparently Katy and Dev got so mad, as well as their other friends, that they threw Sally and Bob out the party.

Since then, Sally and Bob got into a big fight over it and are seperated now, with Sally staying at her parents. The reason she reached out to me was because she wanted me to reach out to Katy for her and tell her how sorry she was and that Bob was out of line.

Now I’m not sure what I should do. On one hand, I’m still mad at Sally for asking me to take off my hijab, but on the other, I know that Sally is truly sorry and really wants to reconcile with her sister. Katy and Sally are really close, but Katy currently has her blocked on all platforms.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Why are you even thinking about getting into the middle of this?

Sally is an adult. She needs to put her big girl panties on, call her sister and apologize profusely AND tell katy that she is separating from Bob. That, alone, will likely help with a reconcilliation.

But that needs to 100% be between them.

As for you - the only thing you should tell Sally is that she needs to seriously consider getting therapy because her co-dependency with Bob has caused her to destroy relationships that she valued like her friendship with you and her relationship with her sister. She needs therapy to learn how to have healthy relationships and to stand up for what she believes as opposed to laying down and rolling over surrounding what her partner believes.

If you want to text Sally text her this:

""Sally, I have given your request to intercede with Kathy a lot of thought. I believe it will be more damaging to your relationship with her if you have an intermediary reach out on your behalf. First, before calling her, you need to find a therapist and make an appointment to deal with your codependency issues. Second, AFTER scheduling that appointment, you need to call Katy and tell her that you have separated from Bob over what he said to Dev and that you are seeking therapy to deal with your Co-Dependency issues so you never allow yourself to become a pushover who destroys your relationships with friends and family for some guy again. I think THAT is the only way you are going to be able to really heal your relationship with Katy. She needs to see that you are serious about dealing with the issues that have gotten you where you are.""

Chapter 1 

Five years had passed since Julian Stewart decided to “come back” to me. 

That morning, we went to the cemetery to visit my father. 

On our way out, we ran into Sierra Hart. 

The woman who had once wrecked our relationship. 

The woman whose involvement had ultimately cost my father his life. 

She stood near the entrance with several bundles of white lilies on her back, shoulders hunched against the bitter wind, softly calling out to anyone who walked past. 

Julian slowed for half a second. 

Then, as if nothing had happened, he took my arm and led me away. 

We had driven barely halfway down the road when he suddenly said he had forgotten something at the 

cemetery. 

He insisted it was freezing outside and did not want me getting cold, so he told me to stay in the car while he 

went back alone. 

I turned the car around anyway. 

I kept my distance and followed him calmly. I watched him rush into a small shop by the road, rent a bike, and pedal away like he was late for something he could not afford to miss. 

I watched him head straight for that familiar, hunched figure without even slowing down. 

I watched him shrug off the cashmere coat I had bought him and wrap it tightly around her shoulders. 

Five years apart, and the moment they saw each other, they kissed like they had been starving. Desperate. Messy. Like they wanted to crawl under each other’s skin. 

That was when it finally sank in. 

People like him never change. 

The marriage my father had paid for with his life was over. 

Seattle had never felt colder than it did that day. 

Chapter 1 

11.11% 

I learned then that when heartbreak reaches a certain point, it stops hurting. Everything just goes numb. 

My phone vibrated in my pocket. 

Julian. 

\[Found it. I’m on my way back.\] 

I stared at the couple clinging to each other in the distance, then looked down and typed a reply. 

\[Take your time. I bought hot drinks. I’ll wait in the car.\] 

After sending it, I leaned back and watched the scene play out. A dramatic reunion fueled by obsession, guilt, 

and years of unfinished longing. 

Sierra’s voice trembled as she cried softly. “Julian… I knew you would come.” 

His voice was rough when he answered, his hand brushing tears from her face. “How did you get so thin?” 

She broke down completely. “I thought about you every single day for the past five years.” 

Julian pulled out a bank card and pressed it into her palm. “Don’t try to handle everything alone. If you ever 

need help, come to me.” 

“You’re the only one I care about,” she said, lifting her tear-filled eyes to him. “I tried to forget you, but I couldn’t. What about you? Did you really never miss me at all?” 

The wind whipped her hair across her face. 

Julian stared at her for a few seconds. 

Then he leaned down and kissed her. His fingers threaded into her hair. Her arms circled his neck. 

Five years ago, I would have stormed over and slapped them both without thinking twice. 

Now, I simply turned away. 

I refused to make a spectacle in front of my father’s grave. He deserved peace, at least in death. 

When Julian finally came back, he was holding a small charm.

A protective amulet my father had personally prayed for. One for Julian. One for me. 

I handed him a cup of hot coffee. 

He frowned when he saw me. “Why are your ears so red? You must be freezing. I’m sorry.”

I could not tell whether he was apologizing for making me wait or for what he had just done. 

“When you went back,” I asked quietly, “no one saw you, right? There weren’t many people around.” 

His eyes shifted. “It was too cold. Hardly anyone was there.” 

The drive home was silent. 

I closed my eyes to rest. From the corner of my vision, I saw the faint lift at the corner of his mouth. 

That expression. 

Alive. Light. Barely contained happiness. 

I had not seen it once in five years. 

Since my father died, Julian had always been careful with me. Quiet. Reserved. Like he was afraid to breathe 

too loudly. 

What everyone else thought was a perfect ending had turned into a marriage built on distance and 

politeness. 

We got out of the car and entered the house one after the other. 

“Sierra…” 

The name slipped out of his mouth without thought. His hand froze mid-air, slippers dangling uselessly. 

Something dark surged up inside me. 

The slap echoed sharply through the hallway, setting off the motion-sensor lights. 

“Julian Stewart, wake up,” I said coldly. “I’m Lily Evans. Not Sierra Hart. What, you just finished pouring your heart out and now you’re already planning to bring her home and sleep with her?” 

He stared at me, stunned. “You… you saw that? Lily, listen, let me explain.” 

I stayed exactly where I was. 

I waited. 

After a long moment, his shoulders sagged. “I’m sorry.” 

Sorry. 

I had heard that word enough times over the past five years.

Every apology was a reminder that he had betrayed us once, and I had chosen to stay anyway. 

I used to believe that if Sierra disappeared, we could go back to how things were. 

I was wrong. 

She did not have to do anything at all. 

Just her existence was enough to shatter what little we had left. 

Because of the two of them, my father lost his life. 

Because of the two of them, I lost ten years of my own. 

Like the final piece falling into place, my heart went completely still.

Chapter 1 

Five years had passed since Julian Stewart decided to “come back” to me. 

That morning, we went to the cemetery to visit my father. 

On our way out, we ran into Sierra Hart. 

The woman who had once wrecked our relationship. 

The woman whose involvement had ultimately cost my father his life. 

She stood near the entrance with several bundles of white lilies on her back, shoulders hunched against the bitter wind, softly calling out to anyone who walked past. 

Julian slowed for half a second. 

Then, as if nothing had happened, he took my arm and led me away. 

We had driven barely halfway down the road when he suddenly said he had forgotten something at the 

cemetery. 

He insisted it was freezing outside and did not want me getting cold, so he told me to stay in the car while he 

went back alone. 

I turned the car around anyway. 

I kept my distance and followed him calmly. I watched him rush into a small shop by the road, rent a bike, and pedal away like he was late for something he could not afford to miss. 

I watched him head straight for that familiar, hunched figure without even slowing down. 

I watched him shrug off the cashmere coat I had bought him and wrap it tightly around her shoulders. 

Five years apart, and the moment they saw each other, they kissed like they had been starving. Desperate. Messy. Like they wanted to crawl under each other’s skin. 

That was when it finally sank in. 

People like him never change. 

The marriage my father had paid for with his life was over. 

Seattle had never felt colder than it did that day.

I learned then that when heartbreak reaches a certain point, it stops hurting. Everything just goes numb. 

My phone vibrated in my pocket. 

Julian. 

\[Found it. I’m on my way back.\] 

I stared at the couple clinging to each other in the distance, then looked down and typed a reply. 

\[Take your time. I bought hot drinks. I’ll wait in the car.\] 

After sending it, I leaned back and watched the scene play out. A dramatic reunion fueled by obsession, guilt, 

and years of unfinished longing. 

Sierra’s voice trembled as she cried softly. “Julian… I knew you would come.” 

His voice was rough when he answered, his hand brushing tears from her face. “How did you get so thin?” 

She broke down completely. “I thought about you every single day for the past five years.”

I am sorry for every wound that I cut into your soul. It was selfish of me, I am sorry for breaking your heart when all you did was offer me kindness,  your empathy and truly did love you very much. Please believe that. I destroyed our beautiful relationship by the lies I told. I didn't open my eyes wide enough to acknowledge how my actions were taking a toll on how both mentally and physically. I am so so sorry. It does saddened me to read what I had done to you. I am not a monster, I  am a human being that doesn't know how to love correctly.  I have been fighting my inner demons and took it out on you and destroyed our beautiful relationship. I have sought out counseling. And I have found God again.  I never got physical with you, I read something about a concussion,??? Self inflicted. I never knew that occurred  and when. And I  read that I  cheated on you. ?? When  that never occurred. I wanted that clarified. But I will handle my scandal and take blame were my blame is needed. I am sorry. I will say that I  enjoyed your morning coffee, morning texts, seeing you at lunch time, me racing out to your car and you calling me sugar plum. I loved cuddling on your chest were I felt safe. Us watching birds on the deck, our 3-5mile walks. It was fun antique shopping as well. All that died because of me. Please never doubt, those feelings were real from me. It broke my heart very badly. These are not just feel good words. I mean them. Because I have done alot of growing since you have seen me. I have also done alot of therapy. I am able to explain myself better. I was so busy fighting my hurt and anger from being human trafficked and abused, that I didn't realize and the time I was projecting it towards you. I am very sorry.

So I had a couple ideas I wanted to run by the experts 

1) use Grindz grinder cleaner tablets. Few cycles, will that be enough ?

2) purchase some cheap grocery store coffee ...you know the bags that say ""FULL-BODIED....BOLD"" haha and just run about a pound through my grinder and maybe use the ground as compost or something

Langley: Hello hello! I need to write a scene today with the FLIs, but then I will hop back on here to answer your questions. Thank you so much for your sweet words and your kind welcome!

She came back to answer after 4 hrs later.

Q: Hey, dear Langley! I’m so happy you joined this group and I can finally thank you for all your hard work! I absolutely love VfV and 7B and I’m super excited about the new story. Your FLIs are literally my favorites, I love them with all my heart.

You probably already know this, but the wlw community really appreciates how you represent female love interests with just as much depth and screentime as male LIs. Thanks again for that! 💖

I won’t delete the app as long as you keep writing new stories.

Wishing you all the best and lots of good vibes

 A: Oh thank you for your support! And yes, always! Hang in there—Virginia and Sabrina are integral to the plot, and play key roles in the upcoming seasons... :)

 Q: Langley, hi! Can you please answer a few questions (sorry for the mistakes, I'm using Google Translate):

1. How do you manage to find so many references for outfits and hairstyles in the new story? There are 80 episodes planned, which means around 240 outfits and even more hairstyles.

 A: Yes! We have language barrier but we can still make it work!

It'll probably be closer to 200 outfits, because of how the asset budget works. But yes... With the historicals, it is easier than the contemporaries. When I was writing 7B, it was very hard. Every region has an idea of what is fashionable now, and that idea changes month-to-month. The Pacific Northwest, where I live, has to be one of the least fashionable places on the planet! I love designer clothes (I buy thrift), but it was a challenge. For the historicals, it is much easier. Most of the ""1920s"" outfits online are not very good. I have some Sears catalogues (for Versailles I found fashion plates and collected coffee table books of portraits), but our artists prefer working from photographs rather than drawings. What makes for some truly fantastic references are museum collections. Archives can be more useful for practical wear, so if you date isolate a group of photos, then add the word ""golfing"" for example, you can get an idea of what people wore in the time. When I find good references, I often note the designer somewhere, and then I can search for other dresses by that same fashion house, so I will often find things that way. By asking for specific attributes—that this dress be done in a particular fabric or color, or with a particular pattern or detail, I can ask artists to combine different things, to make a whole new creation. For hair, it often works that way too. But with hair I'm also using celebrity photographs of the time for inspiration, as the hairstyles for most women were less elaborate and more everyday. So the celebrity images give some variety to the typical 1920s styles.

2. How often will there be cutscenes featuring each of the favorites?

A: Currently, the budget is 2-3 cut scenes per every 5-6 chapters.

3. When are the sex scenes with the favorites planned?

A: When it feels right ;)

I've been on the fence about this. I have the emotional arcs all planned out. I think writing sex scenes is a strength of mine, so it is something I want to play into. But I am trying to write in a slower way that focuses more on the emotionality of the romance. I want to bring the emotions as high as possible before things become more physical. Short answer: I don't know!

4. Will the achievements be based on re-runs? 80 episodes is cool, but it will be very difficult to get achievements by re-running all episodes several times

A: I just scanned the list and I think there are only 2 of my planned achievements that are mutually exclusive—even those, it may depend on if players hedge their bets, kind of playing both paths at once, or select more dramatic choices. The majority of achievements will be possible on one playthrough for all routes. I do plan to pace them out to be revealed more along the way, as I think that will be more fun. :)

Q: In the sixth episode, the ""stealth"" stats are lost. Sorry, my English is bad

A: I think I saw something like this. I'll screenshot this and drop it in my QA chat for you.

Q: Hello, Langley! Is it worth waiting for a triplet in the new story?

A: I'm not planning on having any polyamorous trios in this story (even though I'm poly myself and I advocate for more poly romance). To meet the line requirements under the new chapter lengths, the code needs to be much simpler. This way I can continue to deliver more story :)

And thank you all!  I don't want to clutter the thread too much by replying everywhere, but I think I've answered most questions. I'll be around! And thank you all for your wonderful, kind welcome! I appreciate knowing that you're out there, and it warms my heart to see how much my work is loved! I find it truly inspirational :)",15,1770958319.0,RomanceClub,3,0.94,False
