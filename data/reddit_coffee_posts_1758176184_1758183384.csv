1nk2c3u,https://i.redd.it/75j4q2q4rvpf1.jpeg,Suzy And Kim Seon Ho’s Upcoming K-Drama Team Under Fire For Irresponsible Filming,"The production team of *Delusion,* an upcoming **Disney+** K-Drama starring **Suzy** and **Kim Seon Ho**, recently got into huge trouble after filming in Jeju Island.

On September 17, KST, the Aewol-eup Office of Jeju City announced that it had imposed a ₩1.00 million KRW (about $724 USD) on the production company for leaving trash behind in a natural forest in Jeju Island. This fine was levied in response to a social media user who posted a video of the forest in Jeju last month, documenting the trash allegedly left behind by the crew after a filming schedule. The video showed heaps of plastic bags full of garbage dumped right in the middle of the forest. Some plastic bottles and custom coffee cup holders with the actors’ names were found scattered around as well.

The production company has been fined in accordance with Article 68, Clause 3 of the Waste Control Act and Article 38-4 of its Enforcement Decree. Despite discovering butane gas canisters at the trash site, the authorities stated that there was no evidence of fire usage at the scene. Since the possession of flammable materials is only restricted during designated wildfire-prevention periods, they couldn’t legally fine the production team any further.

When she started dating her boyfriend two years ago, everyone in our circle thought they were a great match. But little by little, I noticed EJ changing. She used to spend her weekends painting, going to the gym, grabbing coffee with us or hitting the club at night. Now, every time her boyfriend suggested something different, she’d immediately agree, and cancel on us😅😅

One time, we had booked a photo studio for a friendship shoot. An hour before, she texted that she couldn’t come because her boyfriend wanted to watch a movie instead. She wrote in the group chat, “It’s okay, there’ll be a next time,” with a smiling emoji (F that 😠). That’s when I realized she was constantly compromising, squeezing her interests, time, and even emotions into the smallest space.

Over time she stopped sharing her own ideas and even spoke more carefully. She looked like she was meeting his expectations, but the spark and joy she once had were fading.

1nk27lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1nk27lk/collectionmy_alpha_married_his_secretary_by/,"Collection-My Alpha Married His Secretary by Mistake, So I","Chapter 1Alpha Jesse tossed out those last words and vanished into the study, the heavy door slamming shut with a finality that reverberated through the packhouse halls.I stared at the locked door, my chest aching as though a clawed hole had been ripped straight through my heart. Eight years of devotion, loyalty, and love—dismissed with a single, careless “mistake.”My fingers trembled as I pulled out my phone and typed a message to an unmarked contact, one I hadn’t dared to reach out to in years:\[Ten days from now, would you be willing to stand as my groom?\]Almost instantly, the phone buzzed twice. The reply came swift, uncompromising:\[Yes.\]My heart sank, torn between dread and grim resolve.The screen lit again—a video call from my parents. Their faces appeared, glowing with joy. The sight made my wolf whimper inside me, torn between love and guilt.“Sweetheart, you must be over the moon today! Show us the marriage license, let us have a look.”I pressed my nails so hard into my palm that the skin broke, forcing myself to smile.“Dad, Mom… I accidentally left it at the office. I’ll show it to you next time.”“How’s the wedding prep? Everything going smoothly?”“Mhm. All on track. Tomorrow I’ll go pick out the dress.”I lowered my gaze to the coffee table, where the license sat inside its plain brown folder, its scent mocking me with ink and betrayal. My voice came out deliberately light.“Once everything’s set, you’ll bring Jesse home for dinner. Dad’s already missing his future son-in-law.”A pang tore through my chest, raw and unrelenting.“Jesse’s been swamped with work lately. We’ll arrange it once things ease up.”My parents—aging, hopeful, waiting for this day—believed our eight-year romance would finally seal into a fated bond. I couldn’t crush that hope. Not yet.Footsteps echoed from the study. I ended the call hastily.Alpha Jesse emerged, brows furrowed, his aura sharp with irritation. “You didn’t tell your parents about the license mistake, did you?”But my eyes locked on his wrist.He was wearing a watch—sleek, trendy, sky-blue. The exact same one I had seen glinting on Whitney ’s wrist. A matching pair.Bitterness surged,. He’d never cared for accessories, not even the engagement ring that symbolized our promised bond; he’d shoved it in a drawer, forgotten. Yet now, he wore a couple’s watch with his secretary.A mocking laugh slipped from me, edged with a growl. “Since when is telling the truth the same as tattling?”His face darkened instantly. “Barbara, haven’t you made enough of a scene? Do you really want to get married that badly?”Pain pierced through me like a blade. “A scene? Tell me, Jesse, what scene have I made?”Eight years of my youth given to him. I had bared my soul, my wolf, every breath of loyalty. And all I asked for was a license, a mark of recognition by his side as his Luna. Was that too much?He pinched the bridge of his nose, exasperated. “I told you, the license can be corrected any time! Don’t you know how busy I am? That’s why I sent Whitney to file it. She’s scatterbrained—of course she’d mess it up. But you? You insist on acting like this. Don’t you think you’re being unreasonable?”\*Unreasonable?\*My claws dug into my palms until the copper tang of blood filled the air. Since Whitney’s arrival, every flaw he saw in me had multiplied, cutting deeper each time.“Barbara, cut back on food, you’re putting on weight.”“Barbara, your calves are too thick, that dress doesn’t suit you.”“Barbara, stop being so unreasonable—you really don’t see how unreasonable you’re being?”Each cruel echo battered my ears until, strangely, my heart grew calm. My wolf lifted her head inside me, eyes cold, ready.He had already shown me where his loyalty lay. Why should I cling to a love that no longer claimed me?Perhaps realizing he’d gone too far, Alpha Jesse sighed and reached for my hand, patting it lightly as though soothing a pup.“Enough. Tomorrow I’ll take you to try on wedding dresses. Just find time to go to the county clerk’s office and correct the license.”I nodded, obedient, docile on the surface. No resistance, no fire.After all, I still needed a wedding dress—just not for the man standing before me.Chapter 2The next day, Alpha Jesse accompanied me to try on wedding dresses. The sales associate, eyes alight with recognition of my Luna-to-be status, led me straight to the store’s most luxurious satin gown. For a fleeting moment, my wolf stirred with pride, my spirits lifting.I slipped into the gown, its weight heavy but comforting, and stepped out of the fitting room—only to hear a voice that made my hackles rise.“Jesse! How do I look in this?”Whitney twirled in a short, sultry cocktail dress, her laugh bright.My face chilled, the air around me crackling with suppressed fury. “What are you doing here?”Whitney spun again, feigning innocence. “Oh? Jesse didn’t tell you? I’m your bridesmaid!”Her voice dripped with sugar, but her gaze lingered on the gown draped across my body, as if measuring me against herself.“Barbara, that dress is too plain. It doesn’t really hold up for a grand Alpha wedding, does it?”A wave of nausea churned in my stomach. I turned to Alpha Jesse, waiting—hoping—for him to defend me, to bare his fangs on my behalf.Instead, he only gave a careless nod. “She’s just a little girl who likes to stick her nose in things. Since she felt guilty about the license mix-up, she offered to be a bridesmaid to make up for it. I agreed.”A bitter laugh clawed at my throat. Whitney bungled my marriage license, and her idea of an apology was to flaunt her closeness to my Alpha by standing beside him at the altar?Exhaustion swept through me, heavier than any gown. Too tired to argue, I murmured to the sales associate, “I’m done with this one. Please help me change out of it. I need the restroom.”In the bathroom, I let icy water run over my trembling fingers, steadying my breath as I met my wolf’s gaze in the mirror. The wedding date loomed closer with each heartbeat. It wasn’t worth setting myself aflame for someone who no longer saw me.But when I returned, my steps faltered.The satin gown I had just worn now clung to Whitney’s frame .The fitting room door was ajar, and through the narrow crack I saw Alpha Jesse’s arm looped possessively around her waist, his stance unmistakably intimate.“Jesse, how do I look in Barbara’s dress?” Whitney preened before the mirror, her voice thick with honey.His gaze burned openly in the reflection, no attempt to hide the hunger in his eyes. “It looks better on you.”His fingers traced the bare line of her shoulder, grazing her skin as if marking it.Whitney caught my reflection in the mirror and smirked, a predator flaunting its stolen prey.“Jesse, naughty. Aren’t you afraid Barbara will find out and refuse to marry you?”His lips curled into a cold sneer, a low growl rumbling beneath his words. “Leave me? An old she-wolf who’s wasted eight years—who else would want her? She’ll be begging me to marry her before long. There’s no way she’d walk away.”I stepped forward, face flat, and shoved open the door.Alpha Jesse jerked back, something raw flashing across his face—guilt? fear?—but it vanished as quickly as it came. He smoothed into composure, his Alpha mask sliding into place.“You’re back? Whitney was just fooling around, wanted to try on your gown. I was only helping with the zipper.”“Mm.” My voice was low, unreadable. I averted my eyes, refusing to give the dress or either of them another glance. “I’m hungry. Let’s go eat.”Halfway through the drive, his phone rang. He glanced at the screen, then at me.“Something’s come up at the pack office. I can’t make the French restaurant. I’ll drop you home first, alright?”“No need. Let me off at the next intersection. I’d like to walk.”My voice was even, detached, my gaze fixed on the blur of buildings outside.I stood alone on the bustling street, the city lights flickering like distant stars. Almost against my own will, I flagged down a cab. When the driver asked for my destination, I gave him the name of that French restaurant.I had already seen the message flash across Alpha Jesse’s phone when I stepped out of the car. Whitney had sent it:\[I’m wearing that wedding dress now. Don’t you want to give a little thrill?\]I knew what I would find. Still, I went.Across the street, I lingered in the shadows, letting my wolf sharpen my vision as I tilted my gaze up to the tall windows of a private upstairs room.Through the glass, I saw Alpha Jesse pinning Whitney against it, his hands clamped tightly around her wrists, his dominance pressed hard against her body.Chapter 3The table was laid with crisp white linen, candles flickering softly, their flames throwing shadows across crystal glasses.Whitney’s cheeks were flushed, her eyes glazed with feigned innocence—but when her gaze flicked toward me, there was triumph gleaming.She was draped in my wedding dress—the satin gown I had tried on only hours before.So this was his “urgent pack work matter.”The French restaurant had once been sacred ground for me and Alpha Jesse—a tradition every anniversary, a place where we had toasted to love beneath chandeliers and whispered vows over wine. Now, the very air reeked of betrayal. The restaurant. The dress. Alpha Jesse himself.Outside, a cold wind swept the fallen leaves along the street, a mournful howl echoing through the city like the cry of a wolf left behind. I pulled my coat tighter and let the night swallow me whole.That night, Alpha Jesse never returned to the house. All I received was a perfunctory text: \[Working late.\]The next morning, I went alone to the hotel to finalize the wedding banquet menu.But when I arrived, Alpha Jesse was already seated with Whitney glowing at his side.He leaned toward her, pointing at the menu with a smile that was far too intimate.“I remember you love Caesar salad, and the grilled salmon…”He went on, listing Whitney’s preferences with ease: no cilantro, hates ginger, allergic to shrimp. The waiter scribbled notes quickly, as though sealing my humiliation into ink.My heart iced over, each word driving the knife deeper.When Alpha Jesse flipped to the mushroom cream soup, he tapped the picture and said lightly, “This looks good too—the broth’s rich. You’ll probably enjoy it.”The last thread of my restraint snapped. I stepped forward, my voice sharp.“Jesse, I’m allergic to mushrooms.”He looked up, utterly unbothered, as though my words were nothing but wind. “You’re here.”Whitney slipped in smoothly, her voice syrupy.“Barbara, of course Jesse remembers. He just wants everyone to enjoy the meal. If you don’t eat it, what’s the harm?”The gall. This was my wedding banquet.Just then, Alpha Jesse’s phone rang. He rose instantly. “I’ll take this outside.”The waiter excused himself too, leaving the private room to the two of us.Whitney’s saccharine smile dissolved. She poured herself a cup of steaming tea, her motions deliberate, her tone cold as she finally bared her fangs.“Barbara.” She lifted the cup, though she didn’t drink. “Jesse remembers my shrimp allergy so clearly, yet somehow forgot yours to mushrooms.”A soft laugh slipped from her, edged with scorn.“And that wedding gown? Jesse got a little too carried away last night at the restaurant. It’s ruined now. Tell me—do you really want to go through with this farce of a wedding?”Before I could reply, she moved in a blur, suddenly flinging the scalding tea across her own chest.Her scream tore through the room . The steam rose in thick tendrils, her pale skin mottling crimson.I didn’t so much as blink. Ruthless. She hadn’t even spared herself.The banquet hall doors slammed open. Alpha Jesse burst in, panic twisting his features. His aura surged, thick and suffocating, filling the room with Alpha dominance.“Barbara! Have you lost your mind?!”He ripped off his jacket and wrapped it around Whitney’s shoulders, his hands trembling as he checked her burns.“Whitney, does it hurt? Are you alright?”Then his head snapped toward me, his eyes blazing like a predator ready to tear me apart.“For the love of the Moon Goddess, Barbara! All this over a dish you didn’t like? You’d attack Whitney? The Luna I marry will not be a jealous shrew!”So—he did know I didn’t like mushrooms.Whitney sniffled prettily in his arms, playing the fragile she-wolf.“Jesse, don’t blame Barbara… it was my fault. I didn’t hold the cup steady…”“Barbara!” Alpha Jesse’s roar cracked through the room . “Apologize to Whitney right now! Or tomorrow, you’ll walk down that aisle alone!”",1,1758181998.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I have a degree and 6 yrs experience in tax firm. Now i think i dont belong to corporate life. I tried, cried, re-tried and more cries. Still trying and crying. 

Thinking to divert my career into teaching and becoming a lecturer (childhood dream)

So i have a situation where i thought my career would fly higher, so i took up rm500k mortgage and expected to pay full installments by end of 2026. Basically for investment purposes. But i know i wont get tenant so soon so still need to pay rm2k first few months.
And i also have car loan rm600 mthly and credit card instalments around rm800 monthly (includes medical card).

I’ve been “living” life and have zero savings other than EPF. Currently trying to save up as much as i can to make up for 3mths salary.

My questions are:-

1. If i pursue master in management, can i become a lecturer in my field ? What are the requirements for lecturer for a specific teaching course ? 

2. Full time vs part time study in uitm for MIM cost around rm8k difference. Does rm8k difference matters in my financial situation ? What are your thoughts ? Either way, its hard to work as tax agent and study in the same time. This work is demanding.

3. I’m thinking to be a part time lecturer in IPTS while studying master for some teaching experience and money lol. Can i use my degree and experience ? Any IPTS lecturer here ?

4. Any other comments/ thoughts/ suggestions from anyone is welcome.

1. Is Garibaldi station safe at night? We are arriving from the airport and will reach Garibaldi at midnight
2. On 22 Sep we are planning to go from Naples → Bomerano to do the hike. However, I saw on Google Maps that there will be a strike happening - will the L1 train or fenicular still be operating in the morning?
3. Are there any good pasta/pizza making classes?

I have also done a lot of research on where we want to eat! Let me know what you think and what I have missed out:

My husband was lying on a chair and his pants were open and a woman's head was moving up and down on him.

I walked up to the couple grabbed the woman by the hair and ripped her away from him.

""Let go of me, you bimbo! Who are you?""

I hauled off and hit the woman in the mouth. ""His wife, soon to be ex-wife.""

""Addy! Wait!"" Link yelled, ""It's not what you think! I was passed out, she attacked me!""

""How could you? And with a skank like her? I thought we were happy! You're going to throw our marriage away for her?""

I pushed him away from myself when he reached for me. ""Don't touch me!""

""I'm tired of being ignored by my wife, she was available and I wanted some!""

""Oh really, well fine! Go screw all the skanks that hang out here! I'm done, I'll be out of the house by tomorrow and you'll be hearing from my lawyer next week!""

————————

Addison Murphy feigned sleep as her husband, Lincoln, rose from their bed and headed into the bathroom. She waited for only a minute after she heard the shower come on. She threw the covers back, jumped out of bed, stripped undressed, and hurried into the bathroom. She opened the door to the shower and sucked in her breath at the sight of her husband's undressed back. She reached up and ran her hands down his strong muscles and down to cup his hip.

""Morning,"" Link said, with his back still to her. He suddenly turned and backed her up against the wall. He leaned down and smooched her as he lifted her, and as soon as her legs wrapped around his waist, his engorged shaft sank into her.

""Mmm,"" Addy murmured against his lips. ""I missed you last night."" Several minutes later she sighed, and said softly, ""Lincoln, I love you so much.""

""Not as much as I love you,"" he said, and smooched her deeper. The next several minutes left them too busy for talking. Twenty minutes later, when the hot water began to cool, they quickly finished washing and stepped out. As they dried off and went back into the bedroom to dress, Link looked at his wife and smiled.

""Thank you for that."" He pointed at the bathroom.

""No problem. Never a hardship to have intercourse with my husband,"" she said as she dressed in a skirt and blouse. As she put on her heels she sighed as she looked over at him as he dressed in a pair of well-worn jeans and t-shirt. ""I wish I could go to work dressed like that.""

Link grinned at her. ""Come work for me and you can.""

""Like I know anything about engines."" She laughed as she finished her makeup. ""Oh, hey, don't forget I have that thing tonight.""

""Thing?""

""The Andersons' anniversary party.""

""Oh, so you won't be at the clubhouse?""

""Probably not. Then I have the Maddison wedding tomorrow,"" she said as she finished dressing, and together they went to the kitchen and Link started the coffee. Addy owned a party planning business and seemed to always have a thing. No matter how many times Lincoln listened to her, he could never grasp the concept of what she tried to tell him she did for a living. It took a few years to get her name out there, but in the last six months it seemed to take off.

Link owned the local garage and was a member of the local motorcycle club and he employed quite a few club members. ""So you won't be there tomorrow for the pig roast?""

""What time is it?""

""Starts around six at night. Tonight we're going over the last-minute details. So tonight's not really important for you to be there.""

""You sure? I could help with the planning.""

""Addy, you plan other people's parties every day of the week. The club doesn't expect you to plan ours,"" Link said as he handed her a cup of coffee. ""More importantly, I don't expect you to plan anything for the club. When you're there, I want you there to relax."" He didn't think his statement was harsh, but he frowned at her expression after he told her about not planning for the club.

""Oh,"" Addy said, and sighed. They had dated for two years, and had been married for five years now, and she still didn't feel like she was accepted by the other members of the club and their wives or girlfriends. Sure, she was friends with them, but she didn't feel accepted.

""What?""

""Nothing.""

""Addison?"" he asked sternly.

At his tone, she deflated. ""I'm sorry. I still don't feel accepted by the women at the club. We've been married for five years, dated two years before the wedding, that's seven years we've been together, and you've been in the club for eight. It's not that they slight me, or ignore me, but I don't feel accepted. I'm not trying to be whiny here, but that's how I feel whenever I'm at the clubhouse."" She paused and then walked up and hugged him tightly. ""That's what I love about you. You know when I'm feeling off or unsure. You get me. I love you for that, and the fact that we can talk about anything, no matter how busy our lives get.""

""I feel the same way, Addy. But I don't know what to tell you about the ladies in the club."" Link sighed as he hugged her, then took the plate of bacon and eggs she handed him. ""I know they always ask about you when you're not there, so do the guys. I know they like you.""

""Oh,"" she said as they ate their breakfast, then cleaned up the kitchen together. ""I'll be home late tonight. The anniversary party starts at six. Tomorrow the wedding starts at two. I might be able to get away around eight, nine at the latest.""

""Don't kill yourself to make it,"" Link said as he smooched the side of her head. ""I know you have your thing, I don't know exactly what it is, but I know it's for your job. If you make it, you make it, if not..."" He shrugged and then grabbed his leather jacket with his vest of colors and a couple minutes later Addy heard his Harley start up then leave.

Addy sighed as she finished up her coffee. ""How am I going to feel accepted if you don't care whether I show up or not?"" she asked the empty kitchen. She continued talking to the empty room. She had this habit of talking to herself to try to convince herself that she had the confidence to do something when her gut screamed that she couldn't do it. ""You're a good person, Addy. Just show up and start talking to them. They'll eventually accept you. You got this. I'm your husband, I'll be there to support you."" She snorted and actually jumped when her phone rang, then as she answered, she put her personal phobias away and got down to business.

Several hours later, Link walked into the clubhouse, and the first thing he did was go to the bar and get a beer. He'd had a hard day at work, the parts he'd been promised hadn't arrived, and he spent several hours on the phone trying to track them down. That put his project back a couple days and the customer was calling, demanding his car back.

""Link."" Mary, the president's wife who was tending bar, acknowledged him. ""Addy with you?""

""No, she had a thing,"" he said, and studied the woman's face and saw disapproval in her expression. He noted that she didn't ask what kind of thing. As he studied the other woman, he realized that whenever Lincoln would tell anyone at the clubhouse that Addy had a thing, they never, ever questioned him on what it was. He wondered if his wife might not be as paranoid as he thought she was.

""You sure?"" came a voice from his side, and he looked over and saw Stephanie standing there. The chick had tried to get in his pants on several occasions, but Link was happily married and wasn't interested. She was one of the women that hung around and slept with any single patch holder that crooked their finger. Not his style.

""Don't start trouble, Steph."" Mary frowned at her.

""It's just that I saw his wife meet several men at the hotel downtown in the last couple of weeks. Seems funny that she has time to spend all day in a hotel with other men and Link works hard all day.""

Link actually laughed. ""Probably her clients. And believe me, she makes more money than I do. If it wasn't for her job, my shop would have closed down a long time ago.""

""What type of clients?"" Steph asked as she saddled up to him and rubbed her breasts against his arm and he immediately stepped away. ""You must be a strong man to allow your wife to meet strange men in a hotel all day every day."" He didn't like what she was implying and scowled hard at her.

""Yep. And you know why? Because I know she comes home to me every night,"" he said, and stepped away from her. He looked at Mary and rolled his eyes. ""Your old man around?""

""Out back with the pig cooker.""

Link grabbed his beer and left them. Steph sat down and sighed. ""Why doesn't he see that his wife's cheating on him? If I was married to him, I'd scratch anyone's eyes out for just looking at him. Someone has to have him take his blinders off when it comes to that woman. Bet her clients are there for intercourse.""

""Stephanie Gibson!"" Mary said sternly. ""Watch your tongue, if Lincoln hears you talk about his wife like that, he'd ban you from the clubhouse.""



...

Two hours later, Addy parked her car at the clubhouse and took several deep breaths. She wore jeans, high heeled boots, a camisole and her club vest that announced her property of Abe. Her husband's club name. She entered and saw that Greaser, her husband's best friend and business partner was behind the bar. She walked up and smiled, relieved that at least he accepted her for who she was and always welcomed her when she was at the clubhouse. ""Hey, Greaser, can I have a beer?""

""Addy!"" He actually yelled her name, loudly. ""What are you doing here?""

Addy felt instantly like she didn't belong, or wasn't wanted. For the first time since meeting him years ago, she felt unwanted, and didn't realize how hurt it made her feel. But she took a deep breath and let it out slowly. ""I told Link I'd meet him here around eight. I'm a little late."" She saw it was almost eight thirty by the clock behind the bar. ""But I made it.""

""Ah, um good,"" he said and handed her a beer. Not sure he should say anything, he said, ""Abe's out back."" And nodded to the back door that led to a patio.

""Thanks, I'll go tell him I'm here."" She picked up her beer, turned and waved to several people. ""I'll be right back."" She called to the room at large. ""I want to tell Link I'm here."" She didn't understand the shocked expressions on almost everyone's faces, but she wanted to see her husband. She went out to look for him and heard his voice over in the corner. The sight before her shocked her so much the beer bottle fell out of her hands. He was lying on a lounge chair and his pants were open and a woman's head was moving up and down on him. They didn't hear her because the woman was moaning loudly.

Shocked, Addy stood there and could only stare, Greaser and Burt, the club president tried to drag her away, but she shrugged their hands off. She only saw red, she walked up to the couple grabbed the woman by the hair on the back of her head and ripped her away from him. She didn't care that her husband's shaft was flaccid. ""Don't bother coming home,"" she said, and turned on her heel to turn away from the sight of her husband having intercourse with another woman.

""Let go of me, you bimbo! Who are you?""

Addy glared at the woman she still held, and in her anger, she pulled her arm back and hauled off and hit the woman in the mouth. She didn't hold back, and didn't care that the other woman actually had a bloody nose. She tossed the woman away from her like she was trash, and said, ""His wife, soon to be ex-wife.""

1nk2049,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleephackers/comments/1nk2049/people_try_to_cure_procrastination_with_pressure/,People try to cure procrastination with pressure — but it’s pressure that creates it (the absurd loop everyone keeps repeating),"Yesterday I woke up at 6:40 after about 6 hours of sleep.

Right away I could tell it was SLEEP DEPRIVATION. I need 8–9 hours.

So I started thinking — should I get up or try to fall back asleep? Which decision to make?

But I had a meeting at 11, so either I get up and manage to work a bit during my strong hours before lunch, or I sleep and miss that window.

I decided to try to get up. Spent some time convincing myself. Somehow managed to.

Got up. Started working.

For the first half hour it was more or less okay, I even felt happy.

Then it all crashed. I caught myself zoning out, slowing down, dragging through “I can’t, no energy.”

I literally felt like I had to give my hands separate commands: “lift up, start typing.” Forcing them to do what usually happens easily on its own. And I could feel my prefrontal cortex burning through energy 2–3 times faster. Even then, my hands wanted to run off to social media — like the task of working in sleep deprivation was too heavy, so they tried to escape.

In the end, I couldn’t force myself to have a productive morning.

At my age now, I just couldn’t. Five years ago I could still resist the pressure of sleep debt.

But with age everything changes. I’m tired of forcing myself, the prefrontal cortex doesn’t work the same, and the body doesn’t mobilize like it used to.

Today I slept more than 9 hours, caught up, and I feel great. Working with ease.

Do you also notice the clear difference between working sleep-deprived and working fully rested?

  
What was that, and why?

I often say procrastination and “cheap dopamine” come from pressure.

I pay special attention to the topic of pressure — I’ve learned to work with it pretty well. Those who haven’t lose a lot, and most importantly, they don’t even understand *why* they get so little done, why they feel bad, why they can’t manage.

Sleep deprivation as self-pressure is one of the most common and basic forms. And for many, it sits in a blind spot.

People do this for decades without realizing its impact. And they even teach their kids the same.

Anyone who is sleep-deprived (especially if you’re 35–40+) will notice these patterns if they really look at how they function:

* “I have to force my arms and legs to move.”
* “I need to pull myself together.”
* “I need to figure out what I should be doing.”
* “I have to drag myself through tasks with a foggy head, when all I want is to lie down.”

The brain doesn’t want to think, the body doesn’t want to work. So you escape into procrastination and cheap dopamine — social media, games, sweets, chats, arguments, anything.

And the solution people try? More pressure. ANOTHER LAYER OF PRESSURE.

Sometimes you can force yourself — especially with coffee, and if it’s really urgent. But not always successfully.

And if you try to do this constantly, systematically — it’s absurd.

You’re “treating” procrastination caused by pressure with… more pressure (which just creates more resistance, procrastination, and cheap dopamine).

It’s like: *“To stop the flood, he decided to add more water.”* Umm… miscalculated, maybe?

And again — this is what people pass on to their kids.

But fixing it has to happen at a higher level. Fix the systems that generate this kind of pressure — the ones you can’t just “shake off,” like sleep deprivation.

Are you really “treating” a problem caused by pressure with more pressure?",1,1758181171.0,sleephackers,0,1.0,False
1nk1zki,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1nk1zki/my_husband_with_cptsd_is_breaking_down_and_im/,My husband with CPTSD is breaking down. And I'm alone i managing this.,"I have no idea how to start and what exactly to say nor what my goal is in writing this. But, I'm in desperation dealing with this alone. My husband very clearly has CPTSD even though he was diagnosed with BPD years ago. Unfortunately, he was diagnosed by the head psychiatrist in the institution and since that BPD diagnosis almost 15 years ago, he's been told by other psychiatrists that it's incorrect, but they won't put anything in writing as going against what their boss said would effectively end their careers. Trying to get my husband psychiatric help is pointless in this eastern European country we're in unless it's to prevent him taking his life as they don't give any form of talk therapy. They only heavily medicate with the same medications to all of their patients with the goal of patients just not bothering others, rather than trying to help them live with their diagnoses the best they can. They give such high doses that when you look up the medications, you basically learn that patients are being overdosed on purpose. So, I'm terrified of him being taken to the hospital. 

We're approaching the time of year when some major traumas happened. And, this time of year tends to be tough. But, last week, I have no idea who he saw, but his blood pressure went high enough that it warranted a visit to the ER. And, even though he was already not doing well, since then it has been downhill. He was smoking weed to calm himself down and to sleep without the nightmares, but we're struggling to afford it and I end up smoking too, which isn't good for me. So, when we last ran out, I wanted a break. I regret it so much. He stopped being able to sleep. He's been having nightmares and went from sleeping 6 hours, to 4, to 2, and some nights I'm not sure he had slept at all. I'm suggesting meds just to sleep or even to buy pot no matter how much it costs. He's very unreasonable right now and keeps trying to say he's fine. He's just angry... but, he's not just angry because of what has been done to him and what the local police have hidden and the criminals they have covered for.

I lost it on him yesterday. In years past he was at least staying home while unwell. But, he's put in public clearing out cafés sitting and yelling in public. Yesterday, he was having ""conversations"" with the construction workers across the street from the apartment and walked out of the apartment stark naked. I got him back inside. But, when I was freaking out he was speaking calmly and telling me I was the one who was being hysterical and offering me diazepam to calm down as if his walking out of the apartment naked to ""prove a point"" to the construction workers was a totally reasonable thing to do. 

The last few nights I've been going to sleep in a different room as he refuses to lie down at night when I need to go to bed. He makes all these social media posts thinking that it will cause the government in this country to act. He's angry that the perpetrators of crimes against his person haven't been investigated and tried, so he cannot sue for damages. He's angry that the police themselves have done stuff that is illegal, but not on the books so he can't sue them. 

Last time he was like this, he was being drugged at the café he goes to. The owner then was someone selling hard drugs shielded by the local police and the police wanted to put my husband in the hospital and be able to discredit my husband as just a lunatic addict so his talk about the corrupt police should be ignored. But, this time he doesn't have the symptoms of being drugged. He's not vomiting from the coffee. There is no odd taste. There are no powder granules at the bottom of his coffee cups. 

Yesterday, I lost it after he walked out naked. He keeps claiming that what he is doing is for our safety. I think he's cracking because he's really been harmed so many times in so many ways and it has left him behind in life. He wants to sue and get some money at least to be able to have something to start with. He wants to see people who have harmed both him and many others in jail. He wants to see police officers who have been colluding with these hard criminals in jail as they have been covering for them. But, his social media posts asking for the president and prime ministers of this country to leave their positions aren't doing anything. Him banging on the wall late at night isn't sending some signal to anyone. And, he is incapable of listening to reason. Last night I literally tried to lock him in the apartment. He broke his phone when he randomly tried to cuddle with me and 4 seconds in was like ""I just need to make this one post"" and I said no, then he crushed his phone in his hand and I ended up freaking out at him because I'm the one working and paying for stuff. Then he acted like I was the one behaving unreasonably as it's ""just a phone"" and he was trying to prove that I'm his priority. I yelled, which isn't helpful, but I was just losing it myself. Every erratic behaviour I started to respond to and say not nice stuff like, ""oh yeah, keep turning on and off the light, that will keep us safe and solve all of our problems!"" I was getting angry telling him that if he claims to be in control of his behaviour and doing everything on purpose (which is what he says to make me less scared of him going insane or something) then he can and needs to stop. He needs to lie down and sleep. 

The last few nights he's been not letting me sleep. Random times coming into the room where I am and switching on and off the light supposedly checking to see if I'm alive and safe. I feel like I'm being tortured through sleep deprivation. He then acts like he's being totally reasonable. 

I have no idea what to do. I think I'll have to get through this work week until Sunday somehow. I teach English online for 2 companies and privately. I might have to cancel my private lessons. Next week, I can reduce my work hours by not opening any lessons to be booked by students in the main company I work for. But, it's hard as we really need the money. I'm all alone in this. 

I found these mild meds my family doctor gave me to help me sleep and took out one pill to offer him as a choice. He was so angry that he flushed it. I asked him why and he said that he didn't consent. I told him I wasn't trying to drug him. I didn't put it in a drink. I just took it out and put it there for him to have the choice. 

I'm at my wits end. When he's not been doing quite so badly in the past, he's just needed me to be near him and quiet, which is quite lonely. He was home, though. But, he's out and about and have no idea how he is currently acting outside. It feels like a matter of time before someone calls the police on him. In the past he's been terrified of me locking him up in a mental hospital and I've had to promise I'd only do it if I felt it would save his life as he's been suicidal in the past. I have no idea what to do and I'm totally alone in this. Skype stopped functioning so I can't even call the crisis line in the country I'm from that I sometimes called when he was like this.

1nk1z5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nk1z5z/what_electric_kettle_should_beginners_look_for/,What electric kettle should beginners look for?,"Hey everyone! I've been using electric kettles for years, and I noticed a lot of people asking about which ones are best for beginners. After trying multiple brands and styles, I thought I'd share what I've learned to help you make a smart choice.

First things first - don't get overwhelmed by all the options out there. When I started, I made the mistake of buying the cheapest one I could find, and let me tell you, that was a waste of money. It broke within months, and the water never heated evenly.

Here's what really matters when choosing your first electric kettle:

Capacity: For most people, a 1.5-1.7L kettle is perfect. It's enough for 6-8 cups but not so big that it takes forever to boil.

Temperature Control: This is huge if you're into different types of tea or coffee. Some cheaper models only have one setting, but I'd recommend getting one with multiple temperature options. I found some great options here: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle

Auto Shut-off: This is non-negotiable. Trust me, you want this safety feature.

Material: Stainless steel is your best bet. It's durable, easy to clean, and doesn't affect the taste of your water.

Quick Heating: Look for 1500W or higher. Nobody wants to wait forever for their water to boil.

I've noticed a lot of beginners overlook the importance of the lid design. A wide opening makes cleaning so much easier, and you'll want to clean it regularly to prevent mineral buildup.

Price-wise, you don't need to spend a fortune, but don't go too cheap either. A good quality kettle usually costs between $30-60. I've found some excellent options in this range that have lasted me years.

The thing that really changed my morning routine was getting a kettle with a keep-warm function. It's perfect for those mornings when you're multitasking and can't pour your tea right away. You can check out some models with this feature here: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle

Also, consider the noise level. Some kettles sound like a jet engine taking off, which isn't great if you're making tea early in the morning while others are sleeping.

One last tip: check the warranty before buying. A good electric kettle should come with at least a one-year warranty. This saved me once when I got a defective unit, and the company replaced it no questions asked.

Bottom line: don't overthink it, but don't underspend either. Get something reliable with good safety features, and it'll serve you well for years. Just avoid those super cheap plastic ones - they're not worth the headache.

Let me know if you have any questions! I'm always happy to help fellow tea and coffee enthusiasts.",1,1758181058.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

It was their fifth year of marriage when Adriana caught Devin, her husband, with his assistant.

The CEO’s office door was slightly ajar. As Adriana walked up, a muffled moan from inside, a voice she knew all too well, hit her.

Her blood ran cold. She sucked in a sharp breath and pushed the door open.

The first thing she spotted were feet peeking out from under the desk, toes painted a bright pink.

Behind the desk, Devin was leaning back, his expression a bizarre mix of pleasure and shock as he saw her.

“Adriana.” His voice was a rough, flustered whisper. “What are you doing here?”

The realization hit Adriana like a ton of bricks, her face draining of color. “There’s a document that needs your signature. Your assistant wasn’t at her desk, so I came straight in. Did I… interrupt something?”

“No,” Devin replied, attempting a calm tone as he tapped a few keys. “Just leave it here. I’ve still got a few things to wrap up.”

The moment he finished speaking, the woman hiding under the desk lost her balance and tumbled into full view.

Her hair was a mess, two buttons on her blouse had popped open, her black stockings were ripped, and her neck was a roadmap of love bites.

It was Juliette Sullivan, the new assistant Devin had recently hired.

Spotting Adriana, she scrambled to fasten her buttons and meekly tried to hide behind Devin.

“I’m so sorry, Director Simmons, I…”

“Don’t be afraid,” Devin said, shrugging off his suit jacket and draping it over the young woman’s shoulders. “You can go. I’ll handle this.”

Juliette nodded shyly and practically bolted from the office.

“Well, you saw it all, so I’m not going to hide anything,” Devin said casually, as if he wasn’t the one who had just been caught with his pants down. “But it’s no big deal. You’re still the one I love most.”

Adriana’s hands trembled as she gripped the documents. After a long, deafening silence, she heard her own voice, barely a whisper. “Devin, do you even know what cheating means?”

“Adriana, don’t make a scene.”

He started walking towards her, his tone utterly dismissive. “It was just a moment of weakness. Juliette’s innocent, a lot like you used to be. What happened doesn’t change anything. You’re my wife—that’s never going to change.”

He reached out to touch her face, but Adriana flinched away, disgusted.

The overpowering scent of lavender perfume clinging to him—a scent that wasn’t hers—choked her, making it hard to breathe.

“Devin, do you have any idea how foul you smell right now?”

“Enough, Adriana. What do you want from me? I messed up, okay? It’s something any guy could do. Compared to dudes who are out screwing around all the time, I’ve been pretty loyal, haven’t I?”

Adriana stared at his impatient expression, barely able to process what she was hearing.

“What did you just say? Devin, are you even hearing yourself speak right now?”

Had it only been seven years? What happened to the man who once held her and promised to cherish only her, to love no one else?

When she first met Devin, she was the pampered daughter of the Simmons family.

And him? Just a college grad trying to find his way in the world.

Chapter 2 - A Heart's Betrayal and a Final Farewell

As she was leaving the hotel after a charity gala, a pack of goons cornered her.

Just as panic was about to set in, Devin Campbell swooped in and saved the day.

They hit it off and soon became an item. With her help, he landed a gig at her dad’s company.

The second her father found out they were an item, he booted Devin out of the Simmons Group.

For the sake of love, Adriana Simmons went full rebel, cutting ties with her family and moving into a dingy basement apartment to shack up with him.

The first year was rough, no cap.

To fund their startup, she moonlighted, sold her plasma, and even hocked a priceless Simmons family heirloom bracelet.

When Devin saw her crash and burn from exhaustion, frail in bed, he got on his knees, tears streaming: ""Adriana, I, Devin Campbell, swear on my life I’ll only ever love you. I’ll make something of myself, give you the life you deserve, and I’ll never let you suffer or sell your plasma again!""

She totally bought it. For a good long while, she even ditched her bougie lifestyle to schmooze clients with drinks and fake smiles.

All in the name of getting him the connections and resources he needed.

And Devin didn’t drop the ball. The company took off like a rocket soon after launching.

She joined his company as his right-hand woman, handling all his business.

Despite never lifting a finger for housework, she kept their place spotless.

She thought their love was endgame—until Juliette Sullivan waltzed into the picture.

He shuffled Adriana to a new role, claiming someone of her caliber should head up the HR department.

Once she was out of the picture, Devin immediately hired a fresh-faced college grad, clueless about the job, as his executive assistant.

Adriana never saw it coming, but she also never imagined that five years down the line, Devin would personally crush her dreams.

""I get it. Please sign here.""

She didn't say another word and handed him the pen.

Blindly trusting her, he signed the document, oblivious that it was her resignation.

Adriana had come to drop the bomb: her father was on his deathbed.

Her mom had called, begging her to come home and take over the company and the estate.

Her plan was to hand it all over to Devin once she inherited it.

But not anymore. She was divorcing Devin.

""All signed, Adriana. Wanna grab dinner tonight?""

""Nah, I’m booked.""

As Adriana turned to leave, Devin’s voice was soft, ""One more thing. That girl’s been freaking out, feeling like the other woman. To put her mind at ease, how about a temporary divorce? I’ll have my fun, then we can remarry. Whaddya think? Don't stress, you'll always be Mrs. Campbell, I swear.""

""…""

Clutching the resignation letter, Adriana felt like her heart had been ripped out.

After a long, agonizing silence, she finally nodded. ""Fine, whatever you say. Just let me know when it's signed.""

Devin was stoked. ""Adriana, you're the best!""

She looked at his face, turned around stone-faced, and walked out.

He had no clue that in Adriana’s world, divorce was a one-way street. No do-overs.

Devin, since you went and cheated, you’ve officially dumped us.

From here on out, we’re going our separate ways.

Devin didn’t show up, but Adriana knew exactly where he was.

He was at a real estate agency, balling out and buying a villa for Juliette Sullivan, making sure everyone and their mom knew about it.

Credit card statements kept flooding in—the villa, a yacht, designer bags, jewelry, the whole nine yards.

Chapter 3 - A Valentine's Day Balloon and a Secret Revealed

To keep his trophy wife happy, Devin Campbell spared no expense.

Adriana Simmons didn't argue or blame him; she just quietly took screenshots and saved them.

After scrolling through Juliette Sullivan’s social media feed, Adriana started packing her things.

When they first tied the knot, they'd agreed that if a divorce ever happened, all their shared assets would be split down the middle.

So, Adriana discreetly cataloged her half of their belongings and scheduled movers to haul everything away on the day their divorce was finalized.

The next day at the office, Devin wasn't around, but the divorce papers were already waiting on her desk.

She offered a faint smile, impressed by how swiftly he'd acted, and signed without a second thought.

After calling her lawyer to retrieve the documents, Adriana headed to the break room for her coffee fix.

A colleague she got along with pretty well sidled up to her. ""Adriana, it's Valentine's Day today! What's Mr. Campbell got planned for you?""

Adriana froze mid-pour. Wait, today's Valentine's Day?

Every year before, she'd spent it with Devin.

Knowing how much Adriana cherished thoughtful gestures, regardless of the price tag, Devin had always gone the extra mile with his gifts.

The first year, he poured his heart into a handmade photo album chronicling their relationship.

The second year, he spent a month mastering glassblowing in a studio, crafting a one-of-a-kind vase just for her.

…

Last year, he gifted her an entire field of roses—every single bloom sown by his own hands, each variety her absolute favorite.

Would he still get her something this year?

""We're an old married couple now. Whether there's a gift or not, I don't really mind.""

She’d almost blurted out the impending divorce but caught herself.

Just as she finished speaking, a shriek of excitement erupted from outside.

""OMG, talk about a romantic Valentine’s gift! Mr. Campbell really knows how to make an entrance!""

""I’m so jelly of Director Simmons, she’s legit so lucky!""

""Director Simmons, hurry up and come see! Mr. Campbell sent you a Valentine's gift!""

Her colleague beamed. ""What were you saying about being an old married couple? Mr. Campbell is totally smitten with you—of course he got you something! Go check it out.""

Gently nudged by her colleague, Adriana stepped outside.

Visible through the massive floor-to-ceiling windows, a giant hot air balloon floated serenely in the sky, emblazoned with five bold words: Happy Valentine’s Day!

Such an over-the-top display had everyone convinced it was from Devin to Adriana.

Only Juliette stood to the side, murmuring softly, ""Actually, this is a Valentine’s gift from my boyfriend!""

Someone nearby overheard and immediately scoffed. ""Your boyfriend? Ms. Sullivan, aren't you getting a bit ahead of yourself?""

""Seriously, we haven't even heard you're dating anyone, let alone someone this loaded! I don't buy it!""

""This has gotta be from Mr. Campbell to Director Simmons. Stop trying to steal the spotlight.""

On the verge of tears, Juliette insisted, ""It’s the truth! And my boyfriend and I are getting married soon!""

Hearing this, Adriana’s brow furrowed slightly.

Devin’s really moving fast—we’re not even divorced yet, and he’s already planning to marry Juliette.

""OMG, Ms. Sullivan is actually telling the truth! Look at the smaller text down below!""

As the balloon drifted closer, someone finally spotted the line of text beneath the main message.

[Juliette Sullivan, marry me!]

A hush fell over the crowd, everyone exchanging awkward glances between Adriana and Juliette, standing side by side.

The atmosphere grew thick with tension until someone tried to break the ice.

""Well, Ms. Sullivan’s boyfriend might be generous, but he’s got nothing on Mr. Campbell. Last year, Mr. Campbell gifted Director Simmons a whole field of roses! This year's gift has to be even more epic.""

A colleague, who’d always been critical of Juliette’s revealing outfits, chimed in with a teasing tone, ""Ms. Sullivan, who exactly is this mystery boyfriend of yours? Does he even exist? Or did you rent this hot air balloon yourself?""",1,1758180767.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

**Format & Convenience**

What makes Biostrips different is that they are sugar free strips that dissolve on your tongue. Personally i find them way easier to stick with daily since there is no water needed 

**Ingredients & Taste**

The energy and wellbeing support strips i tested had green coffee extract, maca root and panax ginseng. The flavor is berry mint which was light and not overly sweet. I am not a fan of berry though.

**Daily Use**

I used them mostly in the mornings and sometimes before heading to the gym or traveling. I liked that they were portable and quick

**Things to Keep in Mind**

They are still supplements so you wont notice anything overnight. Consistency matters and I found them most useful when I paired them with my usual diet and sleep habits. Also strips wont replace a balanced lifestyle but they can fit into one really easily.

**Overall**

For me, the biggest difference was consistency. I actually took them every day but again healthy lifestyle is the key to everything. Would love to hear your experience as well",1,1758180604.0,ProductReviewsHub,1,1.0,False

It's not about how many hours you study, but rather how effectively you use that time. Here are some of the best study methods to help you get ahead.

**1. Active Learning:** Ditch passive methods like re-reading or highlighting. Instead, engage with the material by actively recalling information. Techniques like ""retrieval practice,"" where you quiz yourself with flashcards or practice problems, and the ""Feynman Technique,"" where you teach a concept in simple terms, are highly effective. These methods force your brain to process and retain information, leading to better long-term memory.

https://preview.redd.it/s93nbf36kvpf1.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0b2807122243e829ca7ae96e58f9244211f629b

**2. Spaced Repetition:** Instead of cramming, spread out your study sessions over time. Reviewing material at increasing intervals—for example, a day, a few days, a week, then a month after learning it—helps move information from short-term to long-term memory.

**3. Strategic Scheduling:** Treat your coursework like a full-time job. Use a planner or a digital calendar to map out all your assignments, exams, and projects for the entire semester. Break down large assignments into smaller, manageable tasks. The Pomodoro Technique, which involves 25-minute focused study sessions followed by short breaks, can help you stay productive and avoid burnout.

**4. Create a Conducive Environment:** Find a study space that works for you, whether it's a quiet library or a bustling coffee shop. Minimize distractions by silencing your phone and social media notifications. Having a dedicated space and routine can train your brain to get into ""study mode"" more quickly.

**5. Leverage Resources:** [**Don't hesitate to ask for help**](https://usaonlineessays.com/). Make use of your professor's office hours, and consider forming a study group. Explaining concepts to classmates and hearing different perspectives can strengthen your own understanding. Remember, academic support centers, tutors, and online resources are there to help you succeed",1,1758180128.0,Usaonlineessays1,0,1.0,False

I'm turning 24 soon and it's hard feeling like all I can do is work, go to coffee shops or the library, and go to church events. I go to the church that has been talked about a lot recently in this subreddit, and I wish I could leave too. I tried some meetups but many of them go too late for my mom's liking, and I ended up getting hit on a lot in a lot of uncomfortable ways.

On workdays, I would stay in bed until 8 o’clock, but I needed to leave by 8:20. It takes me over 30 minutes to get to the office, so I could barely make it in time to clock in at 9. I’d skip breakfast because I couldn’t eat, rush to work with the crowd, complain about how badly I slept the night before, and feel completely exhausted. I still had to face annoying bosses at work, and after work, I had to drag my tired body to socialize. It was terrible—this feeling of awfulness seemed to start from lying in bed and kept looping, occupying all my time. I can’t imagine how long this terrible cycle would last.

For the past 10 years since college, I rarely experienced the morning sunlight or the hopeful and reassuring feeling when the sun first rises. But now, I get up at 6:30 every day, and I’ve stuck to this for one and a half months. Every morning after getting up, I go for a half-hour walk outside, looking at the lush plants, the busy birds chirping away, then come home to enjoy a delicious breakfast, make myself a cup of coffee, wash up, and leisurely head out to work. My mornings have become much more relaxed. After sticking to this for a week, I found that I no longer had so many negative feelings every day. Even when I had a terrible night’s sleep, I would still get up and go for a walk. I confirmed that this habit helped my body wake up and feel less groggy, and I felt sleepier at night. All this just because I insisted on going for a walk at 6:30 every day, and then did a series of things I enjoyed before work. I started to change, and this gave me more motivation to keep going.

I looked up some information and found the effects of morning sunlight:

Exposure to bright light in the morning suppresses melatonin production, making you feel more awake.

Morning sunlight helps adjust circadian rhythm disorders, assisting people with difficulty falling asleep or early awakening to restore a normal sleep schedule.

Most importantly, I feel that a positive and fulfilling morning starts my day off well and shifts my focus away from negative sleep issues. My days are more productive, I use more energy, and I feel sleepier at night, which has improved my sleep time.",5,1758179272.0,sleep,3,1.0,False

That’s now been ruled out, and after I attended a doctor appointment with my husband requesting more to be done because no one was taking his testimony alone seriously, he’s been referred to a sleep specialist in late October. The current leading theory is Narcolepsy (type 2) or Idiopathic Hypersomnia. 

My husband can’t remember most of his sleep attacks/episodes, so I am the primary (if not, only) witness which got me wondering how others describe living with someone with Narcolepsy or IH - particularly before medication or diagnosis.

For me, in many ways, I am living in absolute hell. Our son is 7 months old now and I feel as though I am a full time carer for both of them. Constantly infuriated by things that are currently out of my control. I’m living off coffee and nothing else. Not to mention, the neverending ‘support’ from friends and family saying “oh, I understand, my partner is a deep sleeper too” is beginning to drive me insane.

I have been taking some form of blue lotus now for over 4 years.  
Its interesting how my life has drastically shifted!  At first it was subtle changes, my libido sky rocketed, I started to love myself deeper, and then over time I became more sensitive to the effects.  
The 200:1 EXTRACT powder, i have in my coffee or cacao, is really strong when I have a lot of it, though it doesn't have the same effect for me as the tea, when I have a strong brew of Blue Lotus Euphoria blend, I feel almost HIGH!  
The first time I did a tea ceremony was with whole flowers and I made it so strong that when I was in meditation I thought i was going to start hallucinating!  I didn't luckily, though I definitely felt a activation in my third eye.  
I don't know why some people really feel it while others don't feel anything!!  
I feel it most when I have having a pot of tea with my friends, or lovers.  
I take the tincture during the day and that calms my NS.  
Though all this blue lotus for such a long time, its like I rely on it now.  
Does anyone know if its bad long term?  
Why does the tea, extract and tincture all hit me differently?

I enjoy a good espresso or long black, but don’t need to optimise the last 5-2% at high cost. I am open to playing with medium roasts, but am not the person for tea-like, light roasted pour-overs (maybe I am getting it wrong that these things are linked).

My skill is very limited, but I have read the basics and am trying. I believe my 20yo conical Solis Scala Grinder is not the worst, but probably reducing the quality of my shots. It is also a bit broken (timer, adjustment of grind very hard). So I want to replace it.

Since I am making coffee mostly just for myself, the amount of shots I pull is little. So is my counter space. I have the impression that a single dose grinder with hardly retention, possibly flat burrs, may be the best choice for me. Niche zero is a candidate or Eureka Oro Mignon  look tempting, but then I think I don’t need to spend double of what I spent on the machine on the grinder. That’s probably out of balance. In the mid-low tier price segment I find it harder  to identify what could be a good choice. I dont want to spend 300 Eur, be unhappy, and then spend 600 eur for the option I was considering in the first place.

I am looking for someone to tell me either

•	⁠spending that money on the Niche or X is definitely worth it even with your machine and limited ambitions or:

1nk191x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nk191x/my_boyfriend_got_drunk_and_disrespected_me_in/,My boyfriend got drunk and disrespected me in front of my family. He breaks up with me cause I’ve not been supportive.,"Me (26F) and my bf (25M) were together for 2.5 years. We had recently decided to get married, and things seemed fine. I’m an SWE at a big tech company, and he’s a mechanical engineer. I make about $30k more per year. We both started working last year—my job has been stressful, and he was laid off before finding a new role.

When we started dating, he was still a boy in many ways—vaping, gaming, messy room, and lazy. I told him vaping was a dealbreaker, and he quit. He’s social, loves hanging with friends and drinking; I’m more outdoorsy and into hiking and traveling. Over time, I pushed him to work out, manage finances, and plan for his career so we could build a good life together. He eventually followed through—making a budget tracker (after me constantly reminding him) and landing his dream job after taking mock interviews I suggested. He was getting better. I could see how he was starting to grow with me. But it always felt like he only acted when I pushed him to. I started fearing for my future, that maybe I would have to be the only one bringing growth and I started craving more responsibility from him. 

We did long-distance for 1.5 years. I was overwhelmed with work and often took out my frustrations on him for wasting time napping or gaming after work (he never learnt anything new in the past year). Some days he’d be productive, but I constantly felt like I was parenting him instead of being an equal partner. Our fights escalated: I screamed, he interrupted, and we’d spiral. I also had issues with his family (they’ve cut ties with most relatives after fights), which he got defensive about, though he still listened. We even started couples therapy to work on conflict, and had our first session 2 weeks ago.

The breaking point was at my aunt’s dinner. He got drunk and exploded about the engagement ring. I’d told him I preferred a smaller natural diamond (for religious reasons) that fit his budget over the 1.75 lab one he wanted. He accused me of going behind his back and talking to my parents about the ring, but agreed to get me a natural diamond even though he wanted to get a big lab one. So that night, in front of my aunt and cousin, he cried and created a scene for himself (for 3 hours) about how I make him feel inadequate, disrespect his family, and never appreciate him. He ranted on and on about how I'm not ""f*cking getting what he wants to get me"" and how he can’t live up to mine and my family’s expectations. I was so embarrassed and walked out of the scene in an hour, but he continued for 2 more hours with my aunt and cousin consoling him.

The next day, he claimed he didn’t remember anything. I was furious, I argued, threw his clothes, and asked him to leave my house while he begged for an apology. He later went to his sister’s place and told her all the worst parts of our relationship. The next day, his sister texts me, saying we were toxic for each other and that she will not allow this engagement to happen. My boyfriend was no contact with me while his sister was fuming and rudely spoke to me about how badly I had treated him. When I wanted to talk to him, he wouldn’t respond to my messages or calls. He then picked up one of my calls and screamed that he needed space. I gave him his space.

A week later, he agreed to meet with me. He meets me and tells me that I’ve treated him badly for 2.5 years, that he couldn’t keep living up to my expectations, and that I needed therapy to fix all my issues. He said all of my anger was “ a reflection of not what he did but a true reflection of who I actually am”.  He went no contact after that.

I begged him for two days, promising to work on my anger and fix my issues. I told him we need to work on our communication, and I’d like him to listen and understand me better - I really think we both have enough love to put in the effort and fix it. But he’s done. I’m heartbroken and miss him. AITAH? What do I do now? I am taking therapy and trying to work on my issues…

Note - 2 months ago, when I went to Vegas with him, he got drunk the first night with his friends and ended up wasted in our hotel room. I landed late the next day and could not contact him since his phone died. I couldn’t enter our room too since there was no way to reach him and he had locked the door. I finally got the security to unlock our hotel room while he lay wasted on our bed. I was so annoyed with him and asked him to promise me not to get drunk for the next 2 days. He promised, but on the second day, he got drunk with his friends and created a scene by arguing with the security guard. We got kicked out of the casino, and when I asked him why he did it, he said - he wanted to make sure that I had fun at the casino and did not like how we were asked to leave. I understand that he loved me enough to make sure I had fun, but I didn’t want to be there at the cost of him getting arrested. Idk I think he has a drinking problem. There have been other instances in the past where he’s gotten so drunk and forgotten everything that happened.

Note 2 - The vast majority of our relationship, he treated me well. He would always wake me up with a good morning call and send a cute message on how amazing I am and how he wishes to be there with me. He'd give me nice body massages before bed when I was exhausted. He's always be the one making my morning coffee because I like it better when he does it. When he got his new job, I took a day off, helped him shift into his new place, and set up the entire house for him over 3 days. There were many good moments too.",6,1758178294.0,AITAH,42,0.65,False

**Cons**:-

\- Severe bouts of depression. Yes, I had to start seeing a therapist again. Some days are so bad i'll have to take the day off and sleep. Every little thing can put you off. 

\- Old cravings are back. My memory is great, which means I have decades worth of it in my head. At times I still have to say, no thats not how you view a woman.

\- Brain fog, been procrastinating a lot. sometimes I feel so unmotivated I just want to chill and not respond to messages and not do my chores.

\- temptations to obsess over food, coffee etc

**Pros**:-

\- Making things happen, if I've committed to something i'll make it. The anxiety isnt as bad.

\- Communicating better, I'm able to articulate my views boldly. 

\- Probs more of a con but i'm learning about the issues i've been having. This experience has magnified my stresses, anxieties and traumas and i've been working on getting them sorted.

\- My musical talents have blossomed.  I played a lead instrument for an event and made it grand. The comments I got were ones i've never gotten before in my 20 years of performing. I was told that I made the instrument sing. A very thoughtful yet powerful compliment. I genuinely believe I couldnt have performed this passionately if not for SR.

\- More leadership at work and life stuff. I'm taking responsibility for things being the bigger person in the room. Even at work and other events I take leadership and am the person who makes things happen.

\- Women behave differently around me. (No, i haven't gotten laid or anything). Women feel the masculine pressence when i'm around. Someone who treated me like dog poop sometime ago, respected and had deep conversations with me. I'm not doing this to get laid, not making that mistake again. I'm doing this to improve myself and am seeing things improve in that area.

\- People are nice to me. I've had someone drop me home (20min drive), I've had someone offer me study material, someone offer me a job, etc 

\- Skin glows, I've been eating a healthy diet, cold showers are the norm now. Don't see the need to boil myself everyday. A colleague said over video call that my skin was glowing/smoother.

\- More spiritual. I'm hearing more from the one above and in line with what he has for me. 

\- More muscle, less fat. I've been accumulating some fat which have reduced as the testosterone increased. This has led me to fit in my older clothes and boost confidence.

This is all the ones I can think of but there might be more smaller observations.

2. **Adrenaline Release** – It stimulates the nervous system, releasing adrenaline, which increases heart rate and blood pressure.
3. **Varies by Person** – Some people are more sensitive to caffeine and may see a bigger rise in blood pressure after drinking coffee.

# 🔹 Long-Term Effects

* **Habitual Coffee Drinkers**: Many studies show that people who drink coffee regularly develop some tolerance, so the blood pressure rise becomes less pronounced.
* **High Consumers**: Very high intake (4–5+ cups daily) may keep blood pressure consistently higher, especially in people already at risk of hypertension.
* **Genetics**: People with certain genes (slow caffeine metabolizers) may be more likely to have sustained blood pressure effects from coffee.

# 🔹 Special Considerations

* If you already have **hypertension**, it’s best to limit coffee or monitor how it affects your readings.
* Drinking coffee right before a **blood pressure test** can give an artificially high reading.
* Decaf has much less effect, though it’s not completely caffeine-free.

👉 In short: **coffee can cause a temporary rise in blood pressure**, but for most regular drinkers, the long-term effect is mild—though people with hypertension or caffeine sensitivity should be cautious.",1,1758177903.0,u_AyushaktiAyurveda,0,1.0,False

# Why Do Teeth Lose Their Natural Whiteness? ❓

Discoloration of teeth can happen gradually, and many people don’t even notice it until they compare their teeth to older photos or see a shade difference. Here are some common reasons:

👉 Food and Drinks: Coffee ☕, tea 🍵, red wine 🍷, and dark-colored foods can stain teeth over time.  
👉 Tobacco Use: Smoking 🚬 or chewing tobacco leaves stubborn stains.  
👉 Poor Oral Hygiene: Inadequate brushing and flossing allow plaque and tartar buildup, dulling the teeth.  
👉 Aging: As we age, the enamel thins, revealing more of the yellow dentin beneath.  
👉 Medications: Some antibiotics and medical treatments can affect tooth color.

No matter the cause, Shellharbour City Dental can restore your teeth’s brightness with professional whitening solutions. 😁✨

1nk12ug,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nk12ug/reeds_canyon_part_1/,Reed's Canyon: Part 1,"Westville is the epitome of a small town, twisting historical facts for its greedy capitalist schemes. Westville, named after Reed West, prides itself on how my ancestor took a barren piece of forest and created a small farm, which grew into a thriving community before his unfortunate disappearance while gathering pelts and meat for the coming winter. The whole town is crazy for the man, naming almost everything after him: Reed West Pioneer Day, Reed West High School, West Bait/Tackle, Reed Coffee and Tarot. In reality, Reed West and the American cavalry burned a tribe of Algonquin natives as they slept and stole the land. Years later, the government bought Reed’s property from him, and Reed was last seen leaving his illegitimate son at home and wandering into the woods in a drunken stupor.



Ask anyone around town, and they’ll either say they’ve never heard of that version of the story or claim it’s a misinformation campaign from the neighboring town, Ridgeburrow, due to our four-year winning streak against their football team. The only man who would have told you otherwise was my grandpa, before his death a few weeks ago. Before you start feeling bad, he went peacefully in his bed, surrounded by my mom and uncles. I had a good relationship with him, but given that it was slightly unexpected and I was at college, I wasn’t there. I was expecting to be in the will, maybe for something small like his whiskey flask or his beloved ladybug-themed pocket watch, but all I received in the mail from my mom was a small brass key and an address I wish I’d never visited: 15 Canyon Road.



“What the hell? Your grandpa left you a cabin?” my best friend Graham asked.  

“Yeah, in some place called Reed’s Canyon.” I zipped up the last of our bags. “You don’t have to come with me, you know.”  

Graham scoffed. “You’ve never been camping once in your life. At least I’ve been a few times. Besides, I need a distraction after the argument with my parents about my love life, and I’m not about to spend a couple of days alone in the apartment after that.”  

Quickly, I shifted the conversation before things got awkward. “So, other than directions, I haven’t been able to find anything on Reed’s Canyon. You’d think a town like Westville would have advertised the hell out of it.”

“Well, maybe you can stake a claim and turn the cabin into a rental place for hikers.”  

I chuckled. “Yeah, and my grandpa would come back and strangle the life out of me. Besides, I have no clue what condition it’s in.”  

“Well, I guess we’ll find out,” Graham said as he slung his camping pack on his back, ready to leave for that god forsaken place.



Warm asphalt eventually gave way to cold gravel and then, eventually, hard-packed frozen dirt. The orange autumn sun started to dip behind the horizon as my '99 4Runner made its way across the endless dirt road, as old brown trunks gave way to tall slender birch trees, foreshadowing the upcoming winter snow. As Graham slept in the passenger seat, a sound faintly caught my ear, barely riding the wind, almost hidden by the whipping air flooding my open window.

But this devastating discovery was only the beginning. Her three-year marriage, her four-year relationship, her entire life had been an elaborate con game. Her in-laws, her best friend, even the prestigious art gallery where she worked—everyone was in on the conspiracy, all for one prize: her massive inheritance that was about to come through.

They thought she was just a grateful orphan who would accept any scraps of affection. They thought she was weak, naive, easy to control. They were about to discover that an underestimated woman is the most dangerous enemy of all.

……



My name was Elena Porter, and I believed I had found my forever family. After growing up bouncing between relatives who saw me as a burden, the Whitmore family had taken me in during college. Their daughter Sarah had become my best friend, their son Marcus my devoted husband of three years. I was an art curator at their prestigious gallery, surrounded by beauty and love.

It was all perfectly, devastatingly false.

The crack in my perfect world appeared on a Thursday morning. Marcus had left early for a ""client meeting in the art district,"" kissing me goodbye with the same tenderness he'd shown every morning since our wedding. But when I arrived at the gallery, Sarah mentioned offhandedly that she'd seen Marcus's car parked outside Bella Vista Elementary School the previous day.

""Strange,"" she'd laughed. ""What would he be doing there?""

The question haunted me through my morning rounds of the gallery. Marcus didn't know any children. We'd been trying to start a family for two years, but he'd insisted we wait until his architecture firm was more established. The timing never seemed right.

That afternoon, I drove to Bella Vista Elementary. The school day was ending, and I watched from across the street as children streamed out toward waiting parents. And there, unmistakably, was Marcus. He stood beside a silver SUV I'd never seen before, his arms open wide as a little girl with dark curls ran toward him, shouting ""Daddy!""

My world tilted on its axis.

The girl looked about six years old. She had Marcus's green eyes and his dimpled smile. As I watched in stunned silence, a woman emerged from the driver's seat of the SUV. Tall, elegant, with honey-blonde hair – everything I wasn't. She kissed Marcus on the lips with casual familiarity while the little girl chattered excitedly about her day.

I sat frozen in my car, watching my husband – my husband – lift this child onto his shoulders and climb into the passenger seat of another woman's car. They drove away like the family I thought we were trying to build.

The betrayal hit me in waves. First shock, then denial, then a crushing realization that transformed every memory of our relationship into a lie. How long had this been going on? Who was this woman? And why was Marcus pretending to love me when he clearly had a whole other life?

I drove home in a daze, my hands shaking on the steering wheel. When Marcus returned that evening, he kissed me hello and asked about my day as if nothing had changed.

""The client meeting went well,"" he said, loosening his tie. ""Mr. Peterson finally approved the museum renovation designs.""

Another lie. How many others had there been?

That night, as Marcus slept peacefully beside me, I stared at the ceiling and realized that the man I'd shared a bed with for three years was a complete stranger.

\##Chapter 2

I couldn't confront Marcus immediately. I needed proof, and more importantly, I needed to understand the scope of the deception. Was Sarah involved? Were her parents, William and Patricia Whitmore, who'd given me a job and treated me like a daughter, part of this elaborate charade?

The next morning, I called in sick to the gallery – the first sick day I'd taken in two years. Instead, I drove to the address I'd found by following the silver SUV's license plate through an online database. It led me to an upscale neighborhood across town, to a beautiful Victorian house with a garden full of roses.

Through careful observation from a coffee shop across the street, I learned that the woman's name was Victoria Manning. She was a pediatrician with her own practice. The little girl was named Emma, and she attended private school and ballet classes. They lived a comfortable, seemingly perfect life.

What I couldn't understand was how Marcus afforded this double life. His architecture firm was successful, but not wealthy enough to support two households. That's when I remembered the joint account William Whitmore had opened for Marcus and me as a wedding gift. The account we barely used because Marcus insisted on maintaining our separate finances ""for independence.""

I accessed the account online that afternoon. What I found made my blood run cold.

Regular transfers. Large ones. From William Whitmore's personal account to ours, and then immediately transferred out to an account I didn't recognize. For three years, my father-in-law had been funding this secret life, and Marcus had been funneling the money to support his other family.

The pattern was meticulous. Every month, the same amount. Always with a memo that read ""Family Support - E.M."" Emma Manning.

My entire world – the job at the gallery, the beautiful apartment Marcus and I shared, even my relationship with Sarah – was built on lie after lie. The Whitmores hadn't just known about Marcus's secret family; they were actively funding it.

But why?

That evening, I sat at our dining room table, surrounded by financial documents I'd printed, when Marcus came home. He looked tired, stressed in a way I'd attributed to work pressure. Now I wondered if the strain came from maintaining his double life.

""You're home early,"" I said, keeping my voice level.

""Light day at the office,"" he replied, hanging his coat in the closet. ""How are you feeling? Better?""

The concern in his voice sounded genuine. That was perhaps the cruelest part – Marcus wasn't a cartoon villain. He was tender with me, attentive, seemingly loving. Which made his betrayal feel like a knife twisted in my chest.

""Much better,"" I lied. ""Marcus, can I ask you something?""

He settled beside me on the couch, his attention focused and caring. ""Of course.""

""Do you ever want children? Really want them?""

Something flickered across his face – too quick for me to interpret. ""You know I do. We've talked about this. When the time is right—""

""When will the time be right?"" I pressed, studying his expression.

He took my hands in his, his thumb stroking across my wedding ring. ""Soon, Elena. I promise. I want nothing more than to start a family with you.""

The lie rolled off his tongue so easily. He already had a family. A daughter who called him Daddy. A woman he kissed goodbye every morning while I thought he was going to work.

That night, I made my decision. I was going to find out everything. The whole truth, no matter how much it destroyed me.

3

\##Chapter 3

My investigation began in earnest the next Monday. I hired a private investigator – Rachel Torres, a former police detective who specialized in marital infidelity. I gave her Marcus's photo and the few details I'd gathered about Victoria Manning and Emma.

""I need to know everything,"" I told her in her small, cluttered office. ""How long this has been going on, whether there are others, and why my in-laws are involved.""

Rachel's expression was sympathetic but professional. ""These cases are never easy, Mrs. Porter. Are you prepared for what we might find?""

I thought about the little girl with Marcus's eyes, about the casual way he'd kissed another woman, about three years of marriage that had apparently been built on deception.

""I'm prepared,"" I said.

While Rachel worked, I conducted my own investigation at home. I searched through Marcus's belongings when he was at work, looking for anything that might give me insight into his secret life. In a locked drawer in his home office – a drawer I'd never thought to question – I found a second cell phone.

The phone was password protected, but Marcus had always been predictable with his passwords. He used variations of our wedding date and my name. Except this time, when I tried Emma's birthday – a date I'd found on a school form in his car – the phone unlocked.

What I found inside broke my heart all over again.

Text messages between Marcus and Victoria going back four years. Before our marriage. Photos of Emma as a baby, as a toddler, taking her first steps. Videos of birthday parties I'd never known about. A whole photographic history of a life Marcus had been living parallel to ours.

But it was the text exchange from the previous week that finally gave me the context I'd been missing.

Victoria: ""Emma's asking why she can't meet your wife. I'm running out of excuses.""

Marcus: ""Not yet. Elena doesn't know about you. If she finds out before the gallery acquisition goes through, everything falls apart.""

Victoria: ""This can't go on forever, Marcus. I won't keep pretending we're just friends when people ask. Emma needs stability.""

Marcus: ""Six more months. Once Elena's inheritance from her grandmother comes through and we get the gallery expansion funded, I'll tell her about us. About Emma. She'll understand.""

Victoria: ""She'll understand that you've been lying to her for four years? That you married her for money?""

Marcus: ""She'll have to.""

The phone slipped from my numb fingers, clattering onto the hardwood floor.

My inheritance. My grandmother had left me a substantial sum that wouldn't be available until my thirtieth birthday – still six months away. Marcus was waiting for that money. The gallery expansion he'd been discussing with William Whitmore, the investment opportunity he'd been so excited about, was funded by my future inheritance.

I'd been a mark. A target. A convenient source of funding for his real life with Victoria and Emma.

Everything made sick, twisted sense now. The rushed courtship after my grandmother's death when the will was read. The insistence on marriage before living together. The way the Whitmores had embraced me so quickly, offering me a job and a place in their family.

They needed me comfortable, settled, and unquestioning until my inheritance came through.

My phone rang, startling me from my thoughts. It was Rachel Torres.

""Mrs. Porter, I have information for you. Can you meet me today?""

""How bad is it?"" I asked, though I already knew.

""Bad,"" she said quietly. ""You'll want to sit down for this.""

\##Chapter 4

Rachel's report was thorough and devastating. Victoria Manning and Marcus had been together for five years. Emma was indeed his daughter. They'd been engaged when Marcus met me at an art exhibition – an exhibition specifically chosen because Rachel's investigation had revealed William Whitmore had researched my background extensively.

""Your husband was recruited,"" Rachel explained, sliding photographs across her desk. ""The Whitmores knew about your inheritance. They knew you were isolated, had few family connections. Marcus was hired to seduce you and gain access to your money.""

She showed me bank records dating back four years. Victoria's medical practice was failing, drowning in debt from a malpractice lawsuit. Marcus's architecture firm was on the verge of bankruptcy. The Whitmores' gallery was bleeding money, kept afloat only by William's personal fortune, which was smaller than anyone knew.

""Your inheritance isn't just significant to them,"" Rachel continued. ""It's essential. Without it, they all face financial ruin.""

The cruelest revelation was yet to come. Rachel had discovered that Sarah Whitmore – my best friend, my sister in all but blood – was Emma's godmother. She'd been part of Marcus and Victoria's relationship from the beginning.

""I have photos of Miss Whitmore at the child's birthday parties,"" Rachel said gently. ""She's very involved in Emma's life.""

I stared at the photographs of Sarah laughing with Emma, playing in a park I'd never seen, attending school events as a family friend. My best friend had an entire relationship with my husband's secret daughter.

""They're planning to tell you about Victoria and Emma after your birthday,"" Rachel added. ""I found emails discussing the timeline. They plan to present it as if Marcus just recently reconnected with an old flame who had his child. They'll ask for your understanding and support, hoping your gratitude to the family will make you agreeable to sharing your inheritance.""

""And if I'm not agreeable?"" I asked, though I dreaded the answer.

Rachel's expression was grim. ""Based on what I've uncovered, they'll likely pursue a divorce and seek half your assets. But first, they'll try to manipulate you into giving willingly.""

I sat in Rachel's office, surrounded by evidence of the most elaborate betrayal I could imagine, and felt something inside me crystallize into resolve. They thought I was weak, naive, grateful enough to accept any crumb of affection they offered.

They were about to learn how wrong they were.

""I need copies of everything,"" I told Rachel. ""And I need you to do something else for me.""

Over the next week, I played the role of the loving, trusting wife while Rachel worked on the second phase of my plan. I smiled at Sarah's jokes, listened to William's stories about gallery management, and let Patricia Whitmore fuss over my health and my marriage.

At night, I lay next to Marcus and watched him sleep, marveling at how peacefully he rested while living such an enormous lie. Sometimes his phone would buzz with messages from Victoria, and he'd slip into the bathroom to respond. When he returned, he'd kiss my forehead and tell me he loved me.

The performance was flawless. And it was about to end.

1nk10z2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1nk10z2/i_felt_much_better_on_this_but_cannot_figure_out/,I felt MUCH better on this but cannot figure out why,"I’ve been on Concerta 18mg/27mg for ~2 months. At first, about 60% of the time I felt great—motivated, not depressed, and productive. But recently, I’ve been getting zero positives. Instead, I feel deeply depressed, anxious, and stuck in negative thought loops, despite meditation, breathing, eating healthy, and going to the gym regularly (I’m a gym rat, so workouts aren’t the issue). I sleep regularly and all other factors were pretty much the same. 

The past couple weeks, Concerta just makes me sit there anxious, like I’m “anxiously gazing at the ceiling with no thoughts”—kind of like trying to drive a car with no engine oil.

Out of desperation, I skipped Concerta for 2 days and took a small amount of pre-workout (1/3 scoop). To my surprise, I felt amazing—clear-headed, calm, and not drowning in negative thoughts. I REALLY DO KNOW that’s what pre workout does. But I am really not talking about that burst of energy. Not a caffeine “rush,” but actual mental clarity even after 2 days since I had it. 

Now I’m wondering: what kind of an ingredient in the pre-workout actually helped me? I know it might be some other factor but I believe I got something from this drink because it was like an immediate switch from zombie to normal. Here’s what’s inside:

	•	Vitamin B12 (as Methylcobalamin) – 5 mcg
	•	Sodium – 75 mg
	•	L-Citrulline – 4 g
	•	Beta-Alanine – 3.2 g
	•	L-Tyrosine – 2 g
	•	Taurine – 1 g
	•	Natural Caffeine (from Green Coffee Bean Extract) – 200 mg
	•	Himalayan Pink Salt – 200 mg


Has anyone had a similar experience? Could L-Tyrosine, Taurine, or something else here be giving me that clarity?

⸻

TL;DR: Concerta used to help, but now just makes me depressed/anxious. Skipped it, took pre-workout, and suddenly felt way better—clear, calm, less negative thoughts. Which pre-workout ingredient could be responsible?

Now ONE year later there are still discussing the wedding gift we didn't receive and for me it's just absurd now,"We got married last year and we planned like a lot of it ourselves and as mentioned in the title my brother in law and his gf didn't really bother to offer some help etc. but that's not the main thing. We officially stated and said many times that we wanted to have money as a gift because we are looking forward to buy a home and are putting all our money aside for it and the wedding was quite expensive as well and we don't need other things that we won't even use. Almost everyone respected our wishes just my brother in law and his gf needed to give us a voucher for a wellness day/weekend WITH THEM as a group of 4. Now the main thing is that we already got SO SO many vouchers for wellnesshotels that we couldn't even use because we don't even have time for ourselves and we were freshly married and wanted time together not with my bil and his gf, that's not a wedding gift in my opinion. Anyways, one day we went to a coffee shop with my husband and my MIL and we talked about gifts etc. And I mentioned that my family's side was very generous and my brother and sister gave us a large amount of money (students as well) which I thought was very helpful and I was/am really grateful. And from my brother in law and his gf we also got like'silly'gift that should have been funny.... It wasn't...not for us...like a really cheap blender for like 10-15$. We thought that it was a tasteless joke and would have spend the money elsewhere but for then it was funny and my mil knew about the 'joke'. After that my MIL told my brother in law about that whole discussion and the amount of money we got from MY family and brother and that we could use the money more then the so called 'wellness voucher' (that meant going with them and them paying a sum or cover some stuff but idk how they wanted to do things there) then it got worse and worse and SO annoying. So there is the timeline: 

1st, he then asked us about it and we said yeah we would really appreciate if you would just gave us the amount you and your gf had in mind and leave it at that because it's easier. So we stated for sure what we wanted and what would be a better choice because it's hard to find time where all of us can go and to be honest I want to spend time with my husband at the wellness retreat and get my mind of things I don't really need them around if I want to relax. I thought that we discussed it and they will give us an envelope one day and we're done... finally (that discussion was like 7-8 months after the wedding already 

2nd: now my MIL mentioned it again to him because she knows that we didn't get anything. And told him again what amount we got Blabla.... He then talked to my husband and said hmmmmmm no he doesn't think that's ok and he would be happy if we just came to his wedding one day or give like 50$-100$ or something and that would be okay. And now all of a sudden he changed his mind about just giving us some money and still wants to do something just the 4 of us because they want also spend so time with us (mhhhhhh like they spend time with us by helping out, offering help before and during the wedding....mh yeah NO THANK YOU) 

My husband just accepted it in the end but I mean come ON! 

Am I overreacting if I say that I no longer want to be a part of that whole discussion and gift? 
I don't want anyone paying anything for me. And I mean not anymore , sorry it's already 1 year since the wedding...like come on. They had so many chances to ask hey are you going on trips this year we would like to fund a part of your trip or hey are you doing an anniversary weekend etc ... But they didn't ask! ....and it's really not about the money because they have money. I don't know...it's his only brother, why be so greedy about it and stubborn??? I don't get it and sincerely I don't want to discuss MY wedding present one year after the wedding, after we exactly stated what we want and needed most at the time...I mean who does that???? 

Please tell me if I am wrong...but I am already super annoyed and don't want to hang out with them or meet them... I am over it .... But ofc I would be the bad/mean guy 🙄 Help!",0,1758177304.0,AmIOverreacting,14,0.5,False

1nk0yha,https://i.redd.it/4re3fq73bvpf1.png,Choosing the Right Toothpaste: Advice from PCMC Dentists,"When you walk into any pharmacy or supermarket, you’re instantly overwhelmed by shelves filled with colorful toothpaste tubes—each promising whiter teeth, fresher breath, or cavity protection. But which toothpaste is truly right for you? According to leading [Dentist in PCMC](https://www.burutedental.in/), choosing the right toothpaste isn’t about picking the most popular brand; it’s about understanding your oral health needs, reading labels carefully, and seeking professional guidance.

This article draws on expert-backed insights, scientific studies, and advice from practicing dentists in Pune to help you make the best decision for your smile.

# Why Toothpaste Choice Matters

Toothpaste is more than a minty gel. It is a daily preventive care tool that helps:

* Remove plaque and food debris.
* Deliver essential fluoride to strengthen enamel.
* Reduce the risk of cavities and gum disease.
* Address cosmetic concerns like whitening.
* Relieve sensitivity and protect exposed dentin.

Choosing the wrong toothpaste may not harm immediately, but over time it can worsen existing dental issues or fail to prevent new ones.

# Key Ingredients to Look For

According to the American Dental Association (ADA) and trusted dental practitioners in PCMC, here are the essential ingredients your toothpaste should contain:

# 1. Fluoride

The gold standard in cavity protection. Fluoride strengthens enamel and makes it more resistant to acid attacks from plaque and bacteria.

**Scientific Insight:** Multiple studies confirm that fluoride toothpaste reduces cavities by 20–40% in both children and adults.

# 2. Mild Abrasives

To remove surface stains and plaque without damaging enamel. Look for hydrated silica, calcium carbonate, or aluminum oxides.

# 3. Desensitizing Agents

If you suffer from sensitivity, toothpaste with potassium nitrate or stannous fluoride can reduce discomfort by calming nerve pathways.

# 4. Antibacterial Agents

Triclosan and zinc citrate can help control gum inflammation, though many modern formulas use herbal or enzyme-based alternatives.

# 5. Whitening Agents

Hydrogen peroxide or baking soda gently polish stains but should be used under guidance if you have sensitive teeth.

# Common Types of Toothpaste and Who Needs Them

# 1. Fluoride Toothpaste (Everyday Protection)

Best for most people to prevent cavities and strengthen enamel.

# 2. Whitening Toothpaste

Great for coffee and tea drinkers, but not ideal for sensitive teeth. Whitening formulas should be used with moderation.

# 3. Desensitizing Toothpaste

For people with sensitivity to hot, cold, or sweet foods. Regular use can make a noticeable difference in comfort.

# 4. Tartar Control Toothpaste

Contains pyrophosphates or zinc citrate to slow the hardening of plaque into tartar. Ideal for those prone to calculus buildup.

# 5. Herbal or Natural Toothpaste

Contains plant-based ingredients like neem, clove, or aloe vera. Popular with those avoiding synthetic chemicals, though effectiveness varies.

# 6. Kids’ Toothpaste

Lower fluoride content and mild flavors to encourage brushing while preventing fluorosis.

# What to Avoid When Choosing Toothpaste

Not all toothpaste is beneficial. Dentists in Pune recommend avoiding formulas with:

* **High Abrasivity:** Can erode enamel and worsen sensitivity.
* **Artificial Whitening Beads:** Harmful microplastics that damage gums.
* **Harsh Detergents (SLS):** May trigger mouth ulcers in sensitive individuals.
* **Over-Promising Labels:** “Instant whitening” or “all-natural cure” claims are often marketing gimmicks.

# How to Choose the Right Toothpaste for You

Here’s a dentist-approved decision guide:

* **For cavity protection:** Stick with fluoride toothpaste.
* **For stains from coffee/tea:** A whitening formula with mild abrasives.
* **For sensitivity:** Choose desensitizing toothpaste with potassium nitrate.
* **For gum problems:** Look for antibacterial or herbal formulas.
* **For children:** Kid-friendly low-fluoride toothpaste.
* **For implant or denture care:** Gentle, non-abrasive toothpaste designed for prosthetic maintenance.

# Expert Insights from PCMC Dentists

Dentists emphasize that while toothpaste plays a big role in oral hygiene, it’s only one part of the equation. Brushing technique, toothbrush choice, flossing, and regular dental checkups are equally crucial. As one [Dentist near me](https://www.burutedental.in/) explained:

>

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: Should I use different toothpaste in the morning and at night?**  
Not necessary, unless prescribed by a dentist. A single well-formulated toothpaste can serve both times.

**Q2: Can natural toothpaste without fluoride really protect teeth?**  
Research shows fluoride is irreplaceable for cavity prevention. Natural alternatives may help with fresh breath but don’t provide the same enamel protection.

**Q3: How often should I change toothpaste brands?**  
If your current toothpaste works well and your dentist is satisfied with your oral health, there’s no need to change. However, switching is fine if you develop new dental concerns.

# The Role of Professional Dental Care

Toothpaste is an important tool, but professional dental intervention is irreplaceable. Regular checkups at a trusted [Dentist in Pune](https://www.burutedental.in/) help detect issues early and tailor toothpaste recommendations to your unique needs.

Welcome to [Burute Dental Implant Center](https://www.burutedental.in/), your trusted destination for full mouth dental implants in Wakad and across Pune’s Pimpri Chinchwad region. Our implant hospital in PCMC offers comprehensive solutions, including same-day denture implants in Ravet and Nigdi. At our dental and implant center in Hinjewadi, we specialize in advanced implant dentistry—covering dental dentures, implants, and precision periodontics in Pimple Saudagar.

# Final Thoughts

The right toothpaste is not a one-size-fits-all choice. It should align with your dental history, current oral health needs, and professional guidance. Whether you’re looking for cavity protection, whitening, or relief from sensitivity, the key is to read labels, understand ingredients, and consult with your dentist before committing.

Your smile is an investment. And just as you’d carefully choose a trusted Dentist in PCMC, you should also choose a toothpaste that protects, strengthens, and enhances your oral health for years to come.",1,1758177229.0,SmileBetterCommunity,0,1.0,False
1nk0y5p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nk0y5p,A product I built for myself now paid my coffee bill,"A couple months ago, I realized I had no idea how many subscriptions I was actually paying for. AI tools, random SaaS signups, trials I forgot to cancel… it felt like money was just leaking out every month.

One night, I checked my bank statement and found out I’d been paying for a yoga app since *2024*. I had literally never opened it once. That was the “okay, enough” moment.

So I started building a small tool for myself to track everything — recurring payments, free trials, reminders before billing dates. Nothing fancy, just something to stop me from burning cash.

I used claude + Bolt for the frontend and VS code + Expo for mobile backend. What started as a personal fix turned into something other people wanted too.

Fragranges as  expensive as this are a lifetime indulgence, to commemorate special occassions and heirloom worthy memories. This bottle is sentimentally relevant too, but now having used it, if someone has the change to spare it is very worthy.

The notes listed are - Top notes are Palisander Rosewood, Lavender, Cinnamon and Apple; middle notes are Rose, Cedar and Lily-of-the-Valley; base notes are Agarwood (Oud), Sandalwood, Amber, Vanilla and Musk.

However, as a layman i havent smelled most of these IRL so i can tell you what I smell - A very rich lady wearing a branded traditional dress drinking coffee at the Armani cafe in Dubai. Polished nails, Hermes in her hand and iconic sunglasses. This nails that vibe to the T.

I smell cinnamon, rose, cedar, Incense, oue and Amber, with a peekaboo Sandalwood note. Its a rich, warm, cold weather scent that wraps you in a shawl of indulgence. Lasts all day and literally did not go off my clothes for 2 days straight. This is cold temp performance. Outdoors it didnt project much outside the first couple hours, though I smelled it on my clothes next day still.

Since the Kirk incident, there have been customers around the country ordering drinks with Kirk's name on it, trying to force baristas to say the name. A nasty video is circulating of a man antagonizing a barista at a major chain over the situation. Kirk also did order a particular drink at that chain, so people have been ordering it to ""honor"" him.

My shop is in a pretty blue area, so we've avoided right wing customers. Until tonight.

This guy comes in to pick up his mobile order. He asks a coworker if he can borrow a sharpie. He takes the sharpie and proceeds to write ""we love you, Charlie"" on one of his drinks. He then starts asking if baristas can write Kirk's name on the cups, or say it. I answered bc my coworkers froze up. I just told him our policy for it, then he started talking about how terrible Kirk's death was.

At that point I was panicking. The guy wasn't filming us but he was wearing glasses, and I was worried they were smart glasses that can record video. I ended up loudly telling the guy to have a great night and thanks for coming in, being overly friendly to just try to get him to leave. He left, THANKFULLY, but jesus. That could've been so ugly. If he had been recording and I had said ANYTHING that could've been taken out of context even a little bit negatively in regards to Kirk, my job could have been jeopardized.

I used to wear a rainbow pride pin at work but I took it off as soon as I heard the news last week. Things are too volatile for that now, but obviously the worst issue here is that any customer now is potentially someone who wants to get me in trouble - or straight up fired. I do pass, however I am pretty easily clocked as a queer man by most people. So I know I'm one of the baristas more at risk of being targeted.

What makes matters worse is that one of my managers is a non-passing trans woman. She made the terrible decision to say something opinionated about Kirk - in front of the resident military brat, no less. She got reported for it and she was stonefaced when I saw her leaving today...and I'm really scared that she may get fired. Then again, she has said she's close to quitting. So maybe she did it all on purpose, who knows.

I've never felt more like a caged animal at work than I have this week. I can't leave to find a less public-facing job tho, bc I need this job's insurance for my top surgery in about a year. But the dangers have become much more immediate and volatile, now.",47,1758176809.0,FTMOver30,2,0.97,False
1nk0u17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1nk0u17/pain_allergies_and_stomach_vent_warning_very_very/,"Pain, Allergies, And Stomach vent *warning: very very long and some graphic content","I have had stomach problems since I was a little kid. I have also had allergies for what seems like forever.

When my allergies act up I get sinus drainage from my nose and into my stomach.  When I was in elementary school my sinuses would swell so much it would affect my vision(the school didnt believe me but sent me home anyways). And of course my stomach.  The heartburn is horrific.  On really bad allergy days I would frequently vomit blood(they believed me then cuz there was proof). I would frequently sinus infections… so often times the antibiotic quit working.

When I was 5, I had an accident in the playground at my school.  I was riding my bike around a corner and hit a sandy spot and the back end of  my bike slipped and my right knee hit the ground and was dragged. I dont remember how long or how far but it was far enough to separate my skin in half and away from the bone. I had over 300 stitches. Almost every day since then my knee has hurt. I couldnt anything for the pain cuz it would cause me to vomit.

At 8 I had a fall. Went to Dr , he said I had a trick knee (left knee this time)or it was also called the Joe Namath knee (famous quarterback in the mid 60’s & 70’s).  It would pop out of place whenever I did just about anything and hurt like hell. Again I couldnt take anything for pain because of my stomach.

Fast forward to 20 years later.  I was in the Navy and going what people in the Navy did back then… I drank coffee (so thick you could stand a spoon in it) and drank scotch.  Every day. And yes it was very hard on my stomach. So hard on my stomach that I developed ulcers and turned the bottom of my esophagus into the shape of an upside down funnel (I no longer had that little flap that is supposed to be in between my stomach and esophagus) and destroyed my stomach lining.  Of course it became GERD. Forever.  No chance of my esophagus healing. After a year and half of eating baby food, no coffee, no drinking, We thought all the ulcers were gone but the esophagus was still permanently damaged.  During this time they found a hiatal hernia in my esophagus… I was probably born with it (my dad had it too) and I believe it contributed to all of my stomach problems since I was little.

Nothing ever worked for the GERD. I tried Prilosec/Nexum and a bunch of other proton inhibitors. Until I tried Apple Cider Vinegar.  I drank a small amount every nite for 3 years. i actually had about 5 years of no GERD. I made the mistake of thinking I was cured and stopped taking ACV. I forgot that what I have, cant be “cured”.

Did you know that one of the side effects of taking Nexium… brittle tendons.  And you guess it… I now have several tendons that have snapped… one doesnt even show up in MRI’s anymore. Again I cant have any pain medicine… no NSAIDs, no oxys, no codeine, no hydrocodone, no demerol, nothing.  Tendons dont hurt alot but the tissue the tendons are supposed to help arent getting the help the need to work properly… That where the pain comes in. 

Fast forward to recent times. I had a very, very bad year last year. I had 5 separate surgeries from Jan 2024 thru Feb 2025. After the 1st surgery (they were putting in stents), while i was still in the CCU,  i started bleeding profusely they put me back into surgery and the found my hiatal hernia… with a surprise … A 40 year old calcified ulcer. Been in there since i had ALL the ulcers I had all the other ulcers. And it was partially dislodged causing the bleeding.  I suspect when they put the tube in my throat it accidentally went in the hiatal hernia. Altho I could be wrong. They didnt have any idea it was there. Military medical records arent transferred from 40 years ago. 

I was put in a rest home and was molested and I was dropped more than a few times. After I had my last surgery in Feb., I found out that fentanyl is added to anesthesia now days. So in addition to the pain I’m in everyday my PCP thinks that all of the anesthesia/ fentanyl and being dropped so many times that I have migraines everyday and vertigo so badly I can rarely walk more than 20 steps without getting dizzy and nauseous. Physical Therapy folks think an ear crystal is imbedded in the ear canal… probably from one of my many falls.

I also have some nerve damage (we think from being dropped but cant prove it)that I take herbal supplements to ease the immflamuation which in turn eases the nerve pain. To me thats a BIG WIN… some relief is but than no relief.

Current I am using patches both Lidocaine and some Buprenorphine patches… The Lidocaine patch can only be worn for 12 hours the has to be taken off for the same amount of time. The Buprenorphine is supposed to be a weekly patch but really only works 3-4 days.  Like I said some relief is better than no relief.

I was orginally on the film version of Buprenorphine/Belbuca… you put it in your cheek and let it dissolve. It is suppose to go straight into the blood stream. Well guess what… it leaks into my stomach… The heartburn is so bad I cant eat. Its been almost 3 weeks after I stopped taking it and my stomach is still pissed off.

I’ve even been trying pot edibles… I seem to be developing a tolerance pretty fast to almost everything I try (at least there isnt any heartburn or vomiting blood).  But it is very spendy. And after spending alot of money and having relief for a week or two…  its frustrating… its not like I can bring it back.  Most pot shops dont work that way

Needless to say I am severely depressed… not suicidal but if a car tried to hit me … I would hesitate getting out of the way. And yes I am seeing a therapist every week.

Its ok if no one comments on this post or if nobody believes me I just needed to vent … so far its not helping. I just wanna cry and never stop.

Today on the Skyblock Weekly, we will be discussing 3 different events that have happened.

Today, Don Expresso v. LittleXMan808 Court Case occurred with the Defendant, LittleXMan808 found not guilty of assaulting Don Expresso. While many assumed Don had finally angered someone to their limit, several miners, along with the dwarve Fetchur giving his own witnessed account of the moment the incident happened, it has been currently decided that Don Expresso had broken several of his teeth while consuming Tasty Mithril LittleXMan808 had gathered, with this material having come from the Far Reserve. Due to the area being owned by Don’s own company, this meant that the company itself was indirectly responsible for the occurrence. However, there is still some chatter among fellow miners that perhaps they chose not to oust him out due to Don’s company having a history or worker’s violations. Some even suspect that Fetchur had been bribed by LittleXMan808 on the same day, having been given a firework while on the day of the trial, he was given a coffee. Evidence is still getting gathered but for the time being, the case is closed. 

The Year 444 Elections also ended today with Paul becoming Mayor while Foxy became Minister. This caused much excitement amongst carnival fans and dungeon enthusiasts, while there was generalized unrest in the mining islands and the Dwarven Mines, further exacerbated by the trial that occurred the same day. It is hoped by many that Cole is the winning candidate next election, for it will allow for mining fiestas to return to the land, allowing refined mineral and glossy gemstones to come into the market, bringing prices to more affordable levels.Many may have wondered how LittleXMan808 is doing in regards to grinding for his drill. Well, he has around 2,000 of the 4,800 enchanted diamonds needed, then he will work on the mithril and titanium. 

A few days ago, several protests of over 100 individuals occurred calling for the addition of the Mythic Rock Pet. While many who are against it assume that those who protested against it are a cult, some people do believe that the pet being added would improve the lives of many exotic pet collectors, for a new mythic pet would add more trading capabilities, perhaps boosting economic output. 

In the next article (Likely tomorrow), Skyblock weekly will have a meeting with Clerk Seraphine, and discuss the rich, usually overlooked history of the Community center. Know that for the time being, articles will be made once a day but will die down to once a week *soon*, unless the people demand articles be made more often.

1nk0so3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriMet/comments/1nk0so3/just_got_a_warning_for_not_having_a_ticket/,Just got a warning for not having a ticket.,"The issue I have with this, is I pay every month for an unlimited monthly pass. I didn't know I had to tap my unlimited monthly pass. My pass costs the same amount, regardless how much do or do not ride. It is never any more, or any less. It is a monthly pass.

The brilliant people that decided that that was the same thing as riding the max without a ticket or pass explained it as such.

""It is like if you had a gift card at a store, and walked in and took something and walked out without paying"" which I explained that was not the situation at all, that would be theft. 

This is like getting unlimited free refills at a coffee place and then getting a ticket for theft by trying to get your unlimited coffee refill. 

When Fairless square ended, I thought it stopped at goose hollow, and I got a warning then around 15 years ago. I didn't complain I said my fault for not understanding.  This time, however it is completely ridiculous. They even acknowledged that I had a month pass. Absolutely the most idiotic thing ever. 

This coupled with them constantly being late, which I guess is lucky for me that they even showed up this time. Half the time they do not. You usually have a seat full of piss you gotta avoid every other max/bus ride. Definitely be careful where you sit nowadays. Drug addicts smokin fent on the trains. Where are the security for that shit? They wanna come give one of their monthly subscribers a ticket for not payin... yall gotta be kidding me.

1nk0rel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nk0rel/my_boyfriend_disrespected_me_in_front_of_my/,"My boyfriend disrespected me in front of my family, made his sister fight with me, and then breaks up with me","Me (26F) and my bf (25M) were together for 2.5 years. We had recently decided to get married, and things seemed fine. I’m an SWE at a big tech company, and he’s a mechanical engineer. I make about $30k more per year. We both started working last year—my job has been stressful, and he was laid off before finding a new role.

When we started dating, he was still a boy in many ways—vaping, gaming, messy room, and lazy. I told him vaping was a dealbreaker, and he quit. He’s social, loves hanging with friends and drinking; I’m more outdoorsy and into hiking and traveling. Over time, I pushed him to work out, manage finances, and plan for his career so we could build a good life together. He eventually followed through—making a budget tracker (after me constantly reminding him) and landing his dream job after taking mock interviews I suggested. He was getting better. I could see how he was starting to grow with me. But it always felt like he only acted when I pushed him to. I started fearing for my future, that maybe I would have to be the only one bringing growth and I started craving more responsibility from him. 

We did long-distance for 1.5 years. I was overwhelmed with work and often took out my frustrations on him for wasting time napping or gaming after work (he never learnt anything new in the past year). Some days he’d be productive, but I constantly felt like I was parenting him instead of being an equal partner. Our fights escalated: I screamed, he interrupted, and we’d spiral. I also had issues with his family (they’ve cut ties with most relatives after fights), which he got defensive about, though he still listened. We even started couples therapy to work on conflict, and had our first session 2 weeks ago.

The breaking point was at my aunt’s dinner. He got drunk and exploded about the engagement ring. I’d told him I preferred a smaller natural diamond (for religious reasons) that fit his budget over the 1.75 lab one he wanted. He accused me of going behind his back and talking to my parents about the ring, but agreed to get me a natural diamond even though he wanted to get a big lab one. So that night, in front of my aunt and cousin, he cried and created a scene for himself (for 3 hours) about how I make him feel inadequate, disrespect his family, and never appreciate him. He ranted on and on about how I'm not ""f\*cking getting what he wants to get me"" and how he can’t live up to mine and my family’s expectations. I was so embarrassed and walked out of the scene in an hour, but he continued for 2 more hours with my aunt and cousin consoling him.

The next day, he claimed he didn’t remember anything. I was furious, I argued, threw his clothes, and asked him to leave my house while he begged for an apology. He later went to his sister’s place and told her all the worst parts of our relationship. The next day, his sister texts me, saying we were toxic for each other and that she will not allow this engagement to happen. My boyfriend was no contact with me while his sister was fuming and rudely spoke to me about how badly I had treated him. When I wanted to talk to him, he wouldn’t respond to my messages or calls. He then picked up one of my calls and screamed that he needed space. I gave him his space.

A week later, he agreed to meet with me. He meets me and tells me that I’ve treated him badly for 2.5 years, that he couldn’t keep living up to my expectations, and that I needed therapy to fix all my issues. He said all of my anger was “ a reflection of not what he did but a true reflection of who I actually am”.  He went no contact after that.

I begged him for two days, promising to work on my anger and fix my issues. I told him we need to work on our communication, and I’d like him to listen and understand me better - I really think we both have enough love to put in the effort and fix it. But he’s done. I’m heartbroken and miss him. AITAH? What do I do now? I am taking therapy and trying to work on my issues…

**Note** \- 2 months ago, when I went to Vegas with him, he got drunk the first night with his friends and ended up wasted in our hotel room. I landed late the next day and could not contact him since his phone died. I couldn’t enter our room too since there was no way to reach him and he had locked the door. I finally got the security to unlock our hotel room while he lay wasted on our bed. I was so annoyed with him and asked him to promise me not to get drunk for the next 2 days. He promised, but on the second day, he got drunk with his friends and created a scene by arguing with the security guard. We got kicked out of the casino, and when I asked him why he did it, he said - he wanted to make sure that I had fun at the casino and did not like how we were asked to leave. I understand that he loved me enough to make sure I had fun, but I didn’t want to be there at the cost of him getting arrested. Idk I think he has a drinking problem. There have been other instances in the past where he’s gotten so drunk and forgotten everything that happened.

  
**Note 2** \- The vast majority of our relationship, he treated me well. He would always wake me up with a good morning call and send a cute message on how amazing I am and how he wishes to be there with me. He'd give me nice body massages before bed when I was exhausted. He's always be the one making my morning coffee because I like it better when he does it. When he got his new job, I took a day off, helped him shift into his new place, and set up the entire house for him over 3 days. There were many good moments too.",1,1758176514.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

The light was slipping, the Houston heat finally loosened its grip. Streetlamps blinked on - in their slow, lazy sequence, each one casting a small orange halo over the cul-de-sac. A half-flattened tennis ball rolled to a stop against the curb and I jogged over to scoop it up, the familiar grit of the street under my white and blue Nike kicks. Laughter and shouts still floated in the thick air, but already, the game was winding down, its edges fraying. Tomorrow there’d be another 3 on 3 game.

This was the off-season in name only. The Pony League season had ended weeks ago; a season I’d played like a ‘man’ with something to prove after the year before, when I’d been more benchwarmer than batter. But this year, 3rd highest batting average in the league and leader in stolen bases. But with no Pony League until Winter Ball begins, the game never really stopped. The cul-de-sac was our diamond now, its bases scuffed into the pavement, its foul lines invisible but unquestioned. Bootsie was there, of course — preppy shirt untucked, his grin sharp as a line drive — along with whoever else could be coaxed out before dinner. The stakes were imaginary, but the swings were full, and each hit still carried that same clean thrill.

Our bikes leaned at odd angles against mailboxes, spokes catching the last bits of light. Somewhere a dog barked, a screen-door slapped shut or a quick pause to allow neighbor’s car crawl by. I knew the pattern - one by one, the crew would disappear inside until the street belonged only to the moths circling the lamps, the hum of the power lines, plus Bootsie and I.

I lingered, glove dangling from one hand, claiming those last seconds of freedom before the kitchen called me home. “Hit me up after dinner, Rafa” quipped Bootsies, as he turned into his walkway. I nod and keep walking down the block.  

Inside, the heavy smell of arroz con pollo wrapped around me first; slow-cooked, rich, with the sweet edge of maduros caramelizing in the pan. The TV in the living room murmured over the clink of silverware and the shuffle of plates: sports scores, the latest talk of the Astros, some chatter about the Cowboys’ chances this year. Baseball, football, politics — it all braided together in the background.

Papi there, already in his seat, the day still clinging to him - jacket off but posture still straight, hair combed with precision. Mami moved through the kitchen with practiced efficiency, managing the stove, the salad, and the conversation all at once. Plantains on the plate, lechuga y tomate dressed just so, a stack of warm bread on the side.

The talk skipped from the hostages in Iran to Reagan’s new shine, to a family chisme that made my sister, Rosario, giggle. I sat and listened, fork in hand, feeling that comfortable mix of flavors, voices, and the hum of the evening news.

Outside, the night had fully arrived. But inside, under the warm kitchen light, it was still my world — stable, familiar, full of the small rituals that told me exactly where I belonged.

That was the night. And then, there was the morning.

The smell of café con leche was the alarm clock, the clink of a spoon against la taza telling me that Mami was already moving through her checklist. Pan tostado, just crisp enough, sat waiting at the breakfast bar where Rosario and I took our spots every school day. We’re dressed, shoes on, ready to head out; this was always the last stop before the car. Papi, in jacket and tie now, refilled his cafecito one last time before the drive to work, the day’s paper tucked under his arm.

It was ordinary in every way. Ordinary until it wasn’t.

The words landed casually, without preamble, somewhere between sips of coffee and bites of bread. “We’re moving… to Santo Domingo.”

No drumroll, no dramatic pause - just the announcement, delivered as if it belonged to the same category as “Don’t forget your homework” or “Turn off the lights before you leave.” Mom’s voice steady, Pops nodding in agreement. The café con leche in my mouth turned strange, bitter where it had always been sweet. My hands felt too heavy for the cup. Rosario, only eight, kept chewing her toast. Wide-eyed, but not rattled.  Like the words floated over her head while she absorbed the ripple in the room instead: the tension in Mother’s shoulders, the measured calm in Father’s nod, the sudden silence of her brother. 

The room held steady, the plates and cups and morning light all looking exactly the same. But in the space between the words and my next breath, the ground shifted. A different world, rearranged, tilted and hiding under the skin of the familiar.

I didn’t know yet that this was the hinge - the exact point on the timeline I’d spend decades trying to place. But I felt it. A before and an after, disguised as just another morning.",3,1758176231.0,WisdomWriters,0,1.0,False
