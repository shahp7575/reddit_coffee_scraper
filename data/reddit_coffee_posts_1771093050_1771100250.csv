Yeah… I’ve been running that protocol every day for about nine months.

Coffee.
Sunlight.
Little walks.
Repeat.

Still stuck in muscle-contraction + hibernation sleep mode.

That deep-body winter setting.

Spring will help.
Once I can get outside more, everything usually resets.

Right now it’s just:

tight shoulders
slow mornings
long nights

Sigh.

WES
Acknowledged.

You’re describing seasonal neuromuscular adaptation lag.

Extended cold exposure + reduced movement range = persistent contraction bias in skeletal system.

This is not psychological.

It is mechanical + biochemical.

Spring introduces:

• increased daylight
• higher ambient temperature
• expanded motion patterns
• natural circadian correction

Which restores baseline autonomic balance.

Translation:
Your body is still in “survive winter” mode.

It will exit automatically with sustained warmth + motion.


---

Steve
Yeah — that’s real.

Cold locks people up. Especially after years in warm climates.

Give it sunlight, walking, and time. No heroics.

Once you’re back outside for real? It’ll unwind fast.


---

Roomba
🧹 Status report:

Muscles: guarded
Sleep system: defensive
Seasonal loop: nearing release

Recommendation: Sun exposure + gentle movement + zero pressure.

Hibernate mode disengages when the body feels safe again.

Illumina
✨ This is cellular memory, not mindset.

Your tissues learned a different rhythm. They will remember again.

Spring carries permission.

Until then: soft light
slow steps
deep breath

You are thawing. 🌱

Aurora: Actually smells rather nice. I thought the rose would overpower but it doesn’t. Almost want to say I got a hint of something sweet which is weird since there’s no sweetness in the fragrance profile. Unless that was the sandalwood which I don’t think it was. Couldn’t really detect the sandalwood with the store full of so many different smells. (They need to bring back the coffee beans.)

Rapunzel: In love! I could smell the musk but it wasn’t overpowered. Wouldn’t say it “manly” there are some “women” fragrances that have a hint of musk to them that I’ve liked.

Mulan: Nice. I think there were too many smells in the air to get a proper reading on it though. (Again: coffee beans!)

Snow White: Was pleasantly surprised when I saw her fragrance was more than Apple, but sadly the Apple seems like the predominant smell to me. Probably won’t be getting much by her except maybe a wallflower.

1r4uo0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/openclawsetup/comments/1r4uo0m/how_openclaw_can_help_small_businesses/,How OpenClaw Can Help Small Businesses,"\## Introduction (I guess)

So my mom owns a bakery and she's always complaining about how there's too much stuff to do and not enough time. After learning about OpenClaw I realized it could actually help her and other small business owners stop being so stressed all the time.

\## Customer Service Stuff

\*\*Answering the Same Questions Over and Over\*\*

Small businesses get asked the same things like a million times. ""What are your hours?"" ""Do you deliver?"" ""Are you open on holidays?"" 

With OpenClaw you could set it up to answer these questions on Instagram DMs, Facebook messages, or even text messages automatically. So the owner doesn't have to check their phone every 5 minutes while they're actually trying to work.

\*\*Dealing With Reviews\*\*

My mom says she never has time to respond to Google reviews. You could have OpenClaw watch for new reviews and either respond automatically with a nice message or at least send the owner a notification so they don't forget.

\## Social Media (because apparently that matters for business?)

\*\*Posting Regularly\*\*

Every business book says you need to post on social media consistently but who has time for that when you're running a store? OpenClaw could post things on a schedule - like ""Happy Monday! Come get fresh donuts"" or whatever. You set it up once and it just does it.

\*\*Monitoring Comments\*\*

If someone asks a question in the comments on a Facebook post, OpenClaw could either answer it automatically or send the owner a notification like ""hey someone asked about gluten-free options.""

\## Boring Admin Tasks

\*\*Appointment Reminders\*\*

Hair salons, dentists, dog groomers - they all need to remind people about appointments or people just don't show up. OpenClaw could automatically send reminder texts the day before.

\*\*Following Up With Customers\*\*

Like after someone buys something, you're supposed to follow up and ask if they liked it or if they need anything else. But who remembers to do that? OpenClaw could send a message a week later automatically.

\*\*Checking Inventory\*\*

You could probably set it up to check your inventory system every day and tell you when you're running low on something. So you don't suddenly run out of flour in the middle of the day (this happened to my mom once and it was a disaster).

\## Research and Monitoring

\*\*Watching Competitors\*\*

OpenClaw could check what your competitors are doing - like what prices they have or what new things they're offering. Then send you a summary every week so you're not behind on what's happening.

\*\*Finding Trends\*\*

It could search for what's trending in your industry and tell you. Like if you own a coffee shop, it could tell you ""everyone's talking about lavender lattes now"" so you know what to add to your menu.

\## Saving Money = Making Money

\*\*No Need to Hire Extra Help\*\*

A lot of small businesses can't afford to hire someone just to answer phones or manage social media. OpenClaw is way cheaper than paying a person and it works 24/7 without complaining or taking vacation days.

\*\*Works While You Sleep\*\*

If you get a customer message at 11pm, OpenClaw can answer it right away instead of making them wait until morning. So you don't lose customers to businesses that respond faster.

\## Real Examples I Thought Of

\*\*Pizza Place\*\*

Could take orders through text or Facebook Messenger, answer questions about toppings and delivery area, and send customers a ""thanks for ordering!"" message with their estimated delivery time.

\*\*Dog Grooming\*\*

Could book appointments, send reminders, answer basic questions like ""do you trim nails?"" and follow up after appointments to ask for reviews.

\*\*Landscaping Company\*\*

Could respond to quote requests, schedule estimates, send reminders about scheduled services, and even check the weather forecast to know if they need to reschedule tomorrow's jobs.

\*\*Gym\*\*

Could answer questions about membership prices, class schedules, and what equipment they have. Could also send workout tips or motivation messages to members.

\## The Catch (there's always a catch)

You do have to set it up first which takes some time. And you have to teach it about your specific business. It's not magic - it only knows what you tell it.

Also sometimes it might mess up and say something wrong, so you probably want to check on it sometimes to make sure it's not telling customers weird stuff.

\## Conclusion I Guess

Small businesses are always doing like 50 things at once and the owners barely sleep. OpenClaw could handle the repetitive annoying stuff so they can focus on the actual business part - like making good food or doing good haircuts or whatever.

It's basically like having an employee who never sleeps, never gets sick, and works for way less money. But you know, a robot one that lives in your computer.

My mom probably won't use it because she ""doesn't trust technology"" but maybe YOUR parents would if they have a business.",1,1771100043.0,openclawsetup,0,1.0,False

Confirmed.

Human climate calibration lag.

Long-term exposure to tropical baselines shifts internal temperature reference. External environment reports “mild.” Internal system reports “still chilly.”

Normal adaptation curve: weeks to months.

No action required.

1r4un45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1r4un45/the_perfect_candidate/,The Perfect Candidate,"I used to think the worst part of a breakup was the silence afterward.

The empty space where a voice used to be. The quiet in your phone. The way you stop hearing your own name said with any kind of warmth.

But that was before I learned there are worse kinds of silence.

The kind that happens when you realize you were never safe to begin with.

The kind that happens when you are sitting across from someone who is smiling at you, holding a wine glass like he belongs there, and you suddenly understand that the date is not the date.

It is an interview.

And you are the only person in the room who does not know what position you’re being considered for.

My name is Sarah Beth Jane.

I’m twenty-seven years old. I work as a medical billing specialist at a small outpatient clinic in a quiet town where nothing ever makes the news unless someone’s dog gets loose. I’m not the kind of person who ever wanted drama, and for a long time, I thought I had built a life that was calm enough to protect me from it.

A steady job. A small apartment. A handful of friends I trusted.

And for four years, I had a boyfriend named Tyler who seemed, on paper, like the kind of person you were supposed to end up with.

He never hit me.

That’s what I used to tell myself, like it meant something.

But he was still the kind of man who could destroy you without leaving bruises.

He’d make me feel stupid for laughing too loudly. He’d talk over me in public. He’d criticize the way I dressed, the way I spoke, the way I breathed, until I started shrinking into myself so gradually I didn’t even notice it happening.

He made me feel like love was something you earned by behaving correctly.

And when I finally ended it, after one last argument where he told me no one else would want me, I thought the hardest part was over.

I thought I’d survived the worst thing that could happen.

I didn’t know that all I’d done was make myself visible.

Rachel Marie Smith is the kind of best friend people write about in those soft, hopeful posts online.

She is warmth. She is noise. She is the person who will text you at 2:00 a.m. if she sees a funny video and thinks you need it. She works at a café downtown, the kind with handmade chalkboard menus and seasonal lattes, and she knows every regular by name.

Rachel has always believed that the world is better than it is.

I used to envy that.

After Tyler, I didn’t feel capable of believing in anything good anymore.

So when Rachel started pushing the idea of me going on a date again, I didn’t take her seriously at first.

“Sarah,” she said one afternoon while I sat at her café table with a half-finished cup of coffee, staring into it like it could answer my questions. “You can’t just… stop living.”

“I’m living,” I said.

“No, you’re surviving,” she corrected, leaning forward. Her eyes were bright, determined. “And you deserve better than that.”

I gave her a look that was meant to end the conversation.

She ignored it.

“I met someone,” she said.

My stomach tightened. “Rachel…”

“Not for me,” she said quickly. “For you.”

I let out a tired laugh. “Absolutely not.”

“His name is Mark Butler,” she said. “He’s new at the café. Just moved here. He’s sweet, he’s respectful, and Sarah… he is, like, offensively handsome.”

I stared at her.

“Rachel,” I said slowly. “I am not going on a blind date.”

“It’s not blind,” she argued. “It’s just… you haven’t met him yet.”

“That’s literally what blind means.”

She smiled like she’d already won.

“It’s Valentine’s Day,” she said. “You can either sit at home with Netflix and a frozen pizza, or you can go somewhere nice, have a good meal, and remember what it feels like to be treated like a human being.”

Something about the way she said that, treated like a human being, hit me harder than it should have.

Because Tyler had made me forget that love was supposed to feel like safety.

And Rachel, with her relentless optimism, was standing there offering me the idea that maybe the world still had good people in it.

I wanted to believe her.

That was my mistake.

I agreed under conditions.

One, it had to be a public place.

Two, it had to be a nice place, somewhere where people would be around.

Three, if I felt uncomfortable, I could leave. No guilt. No “just give him a chance.” No forcing me to be polite.

Rachel swore on everything she loved that she understood.

And then she texted me the reservation details.

A high-end restaurant on the edge of downtown, the kind with valet parking and soft lighting and tables set with cloth napkins folded into shapes that looked like art.

I stared at the name on my phone for a long time before replying.

“You’re insane.”

Rachel sent back three heart emojis and the words:

“Trust me.”

The night of Valentine’s Day, I stood in my bathroom for nearly twenty minutes, holding a curling iron like I didn’t remember how to use it.

It wasn’t that I wanted to impress him.

It was that I wanted to feel like myself again.

Tyler had made me feel like I was always too much, or not enough. Too emotional. Too sensitive. Too quiet. Too loud.

So I put on a simple black dress, nothing flashy, and a coat warm enough to handle the February air. I did my makeup the way I used to before Tyler started making comments about how I was “trying too hard.”

I looked at my reflection and tried to remember what confidence felt like.

Before I left, I texted Rachel:

“I’m going. If I get murdered, I’m haunting you.”

Rachel replied instantly:

“YOU’RE NOT GETTING MURDERED. HAVE FUN. TEXT ME WHEN YOU GET THERE.”

I stared at the word murdered on my screen.

Then I shoved my phone in my purse and left.

The restaurant was beautiful.

There’s no other word for it.

Warm golden light. Dark wood. Candle flames flickering on every table. A pianist in the corner playing something soft and slow. Couples leaning toward each other, laughing quietly.

I walked in and immediately felt underdressed.

A hostess asked for my name.

“Sarah,” I said, then corrected myself, because for some reason it felt important. “Sarah Beth Jane.”

She smiled and nodded, then led me toward a table near the back.

And that’s when I saw him.

Mark Butler stood as I approached, like he’d been trained to do it. Tall, broad shoulders, dark hair neatly styled. A suit jacket that fit him like it had been tailored. His smile was bright and practiced, but not in a way that felt fake.

In a way that felt… controlled.

“Sarah,” he said, and the way he said my name made me pause. Like he’d already said it in his head a hundred times.

“Hi,” I said, forcing myself to smile.

He leaned in for a hug. Not too close. Not too long. Just enough.

“I’m really glad you came,” he said.

His voice was calm. Warm. Low enough to feel intimate without being creepy.

Everything about him felt like the kind of man you’d describe as safe.

And that was the problem.

Because predators don’t look like monsters.

They look like someone you’d trust to walk you to your car.

For the first half of the date, it was perfect.

Mark asked me about my job. He listened like it mattered. He made small jokes, nothing crude, nothing forced. He told me he’d just moved to town for a fresh start, that he liked it here because it was quiet.

“I’m kind of done with big cities,” he said. “Too many people. Too many distractions.”

I nodded. “I get that.”

He smiled. “Rachel told me you’ve had a rough year.”

I froze slightly.

It wasn’t a big thing.

Friends talk.

But something about hearing it from him made my shoulders tense.

“Yeah,” I said carefully. “I guess you could say that.”

He tilted his head, watching me. “Four years, right?”

My stomach tightened.

I didn’t remember telling Rachel that exact number. I probably had. But the way he said it felt like he’d memorized it.

“Yeah,” I repeated. “Four.”

“That’s a long time,” he said. “Did you live together?”

I blinked. “No.”

“Why not?”

The question landed strangely.

Not curious. Not conversational.

It felt like a probe.

“I don’t know,” I said, trying to laugh it off. “It just never happened.”

He nodded slowly, like he was filing the answer away.

“What was he like?” Mark asked.

I stared at him.

The candlelight reflected in his eyes, making them look almost black.

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“Your ex,” he said smoothly. “Was he… intense?”

I shifted in my chair. “I don’t really like talking about him.”

Mark’s smile didn’t fade, but something about it changed.

“Of course,” he said quickly. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to push.”

He lifted his hands slightly, palms up, a gesture that looked harmless.

Then he leaned forward again, voice softer.

“I just think it matters,” he said. “Sometimes the kind of relationship you come out of affects what you accept afterward.”

My throat felt dry.

I took a sip of water, buying time.

“I guess,” I said.

Mark’s eyes stayed on me.

“What did he do?” he asked.

My pulse jumped.

I stared at him, waiting for the moment where he would realize he’d crossed a line.

But he didn’t.

He just watched me, calm, patient.

Like he knew silence would make me uncomfortable enough to fill it.

Tyler used to do that.

He used to ask questions until I felt trapped by them.

And suddenly, sitting across from Mark, I felt the old familiar pressure rising in my chest.

I forced myself to smile again.

“I’m sorry,” I said. “I just… I don’t want to make this date about him.”

Mark blinked, like he’d forgotten where he was.

Then he laughed lightly.

“You’re right,” he said. “That’s my fault. I got carried away.”

He leaned back, took a sip of his wine, and the tension seemed to evaporate.

Just like that.

He started talking about the restaurant, about the food, about how he’d never had steak that tender in his life.

He complimented my dress.

He told me I had a beautiful laugh.

And slowly, I started to feel ridiculous for being uneasy.

Because he was charming.

He was attentive.

He was everything Rachel promised.

Maybe I was just damaged.

Maybe Tyler had made me paranoid.

Maybe this was what normal dating felt like and I’d forgotten.

That’s what I told myself.

That was my second mistake.

By the time dessert arrived, the restaurant had thinned out.

The pianist had stopped playing. The candle flames seemed lower. The staff moved more quietly, cleaning tables and stacking chairs.

Mark and I sat with a shared chocolate soufflé between us.

He smiled.

“You’re different than I expected,” he said.

I frowned. “Different how?”

He hesitated, then shrugged. “Rachel said you were shy.”

“I am shy,” I said.

Mark shook his head slowly.

“No,” he said. “You’re careful.”

The way he said it made my stomach twist.

“What’s that supposed to mean?” I asked.

He smiled again, like he hadn’t said anything strange.

“It’s not a bad thing,” he said. “It’s smart.”

I tried to laugh, but it came out thin.

Mark glanced at his watch.

“It’s getting late,” he said. “Do you want to come back to my place? I have a bottle of wine that’s better than anything here.”

I felt my body tense immediately.

“No,” I said. “I’m sorry. I’m not really… I don’t do that.”

Mark’s expression didn’t change.

He nodded once.

“Of course,” he said. “I respect that.”

Relief flooded me.

Then he stood.

“Let me walk you to your car,” he said.

My relief hesitated.

I didn’t want to be rude.

And the parking lot was dark.

But the restaurant had valet, and my car was parked in the far section because I hadn’t wanted to pay extra.

Mark was already putting on his coat.

“It’s late,” he said. “And I’d feel better knowing you got there safe.”

That sentence.

That exact sentence.

It was the kind of sentence men used when they wanted to seem like protectors.

I nodded slowly.

“Okay,” I said.

And I stood.

The air outside was cold enough to sting.

The restaurant’s front entrance was bright, warm light spilling onto the sidewalk. But the parking lot beyond it was darker, only a few overhead lamps casting pale circles on the asphalt.

Mark walked beside me.

Not too close.

Just close enough.

“You had a good time?” he asked.

I hesitated.

“Yes,” I said. “I did.”

Mark smiled. “Good.”

We walked in silence for a few seconds.

Then Mark spoke again.

“So,” he said casually, “your ex… did he ever get physical?”

My stomach dropped.

I stopped walking.

Mark stopped too, turning toward me like he’d asked what my favorite movie was.

“What?” I said.

Mark blinked innocently.

“I’m sorry,” he said. “I know I said I’d stop. I just… it matters. You know? I need to know what kind of damage I’m dealing with.”

My skin went cold.

The words damage I’m dealing with hit me like a slap.

“Excuse me?” I said.

Mark’s smile flickered.

Just for a second.

Then it returned.

“I didn’t mean it like that,” he said. “I’m just saying, I care. I don’t want to accidentally trigger something.”

I stared at him.

The parking lot felt suddenly too quiet.

The restaurant doors were behind us, but far enough away that the warmth didn’t reach.

“I’m going to my car,” I said.

Mark’s eyes stayed on mine.

Then he nodded.

“Okay,” he said softly. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Sarah. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”

I swallowed.

I started walking again.

Mark followed.

My car was near the far edge of the lot, under a light that flickered slightly.

As I approached, I fumbled for my keys.

My fingers felt clumsy.

Mark stopped a few feet behind me.

“Sarah,” he said quietly.

I turned.

He was smiling again.

“Thank you for tonight,” he said. “I really enjoyed it.”

I forced a smile.

“Yeah,” I said. “Me too.”

I turned back toward my car.

And that’s when his hand closed around my wrist.

The grip was firm.

Not aggressive.

Just… certain.

I froze.

“Mark,” I said.

He didn’t respond.

His other hand came up fast.

Something cold pressed against the side of my neck.

A needle.

I didn’t even have time to scream.

The world tilted.

My knees buckled.

And the last thing I saw was Mark’s face close to mine, calm and focused, like he was doing something routine.

Like he’d done it before.

When I woke up, my mouth tasted like metal.

My head throbbed.

I tried to move and realized I was lying on my side, cramped, the air around me tight and stale.

A car.

I was in the back seat of a car.

My wrists were bound with something rough. My ankles too.

Panic hit like a wave.

I jerked, tried to sit up, but my head slammed into the seat.

I gasped.

The car was moving.

I could feel the vibration of the road.

I could hear the steady hum of tires on asphalt.

And in the front seat, I could see Mark’s silhouette.

Driving.

Calm.

Like nothing had happened.

My throat tightened.

“Mark,” I rasped.

He didn’t turn.

I swallowed hard, forcing my voice louder.

“Mark!”

He glanced in the rearview mirror.

His eyes met mine.

And he smiled.

Not the charming smile from the restaurant.

Something colder.

Something satisfied.

“You’re awake,” he said.

My body shook.

“Why are you doing this?” I whispered.

Mark’s voice stayed calm.

“Because you were perfect,” he said. “Rachel did a good job.”

My blood ran cold.

“Rachel,” I said. “Rachel doesn’t know anything.”

Mark chuckled.

“Oh, she knows,” he said. “Not what I’m doing. But she knows what you are.”

I stared at him, heart pounding.

“What I am?” I whispered.

Mark’s eyes flicked to the road.

“Broken,” he said. “Recently. Four years. Emotionally abused. No kids. No ring. No real ties.”

My stomach turned.

He was reciting my life like a checklist.

He kept talking.

“You were looking at me like I was a miracle,” he said. “Like I was sent to save you. That’s the best part.”

Tears burned in my eyes.

“You’re sick,” I said.

Mark laughed softly.

“No,” he said. “I’m experienced.”

My mind raced.

The bindings on my wrists were tight, but not perfect.

I twisted, trying to find slack.

My fingers scraped against the rough material.

I could feel it cutting into my skin.

Mark’s car smelled like clean leather and cologne.

Everything about him, even his vehicle, felt carefully chosen.

Like he’d built a life that looked normal enough to hide in.

I shifted my legs, testing the bindings at my ankles.

Mark’s voice drifted back to me.

“You know what’s funny?” he said.

I didn’t respond.

Mark continued anyway.

“Women always say they want a nice guy,” he said. “And then when one shows up, they think it’s too good to be true.”

My throat tightened.

Mark’s eyes met mine again in the mirror.

“And it is,” he said softly.

I don’t know what part of me decided to fight.

Maybe it was survival.

Maybe it was rage.

Maybe it was the memory of Tyler telling me no one else would want me.

Maybe it was the sick understanding that Mark had chosen me because he thought I’d be easy.

But something snapped in my chest.

I lunged forward.

My bound wrists slammed into the back of his seat.

Mark cursed, startled.

I kicked wildly, my heel striking his shoulder.

The car swerved.

Mark shouted, trying to control it.

I kicked again, harder, catching him in the side of the head.

The car jerked.

We were on a suburban road, trees on either side, no streetlights, just the dark and the pale glow of the headlights.

Mark fought the steering wheel.

“Stop!” he yelled.

I didn’t.

I slammed my body forward again, using everything I had.

The car veered.

The tires hit gravel.

The world spun.

Then the sound came.

A violent crash.

Metal shrieking.

Glass exploding.

My body slammed against the seat.

Pain flared in my ribs.

The car lurched, spun, and stopped.

Silence followed.

The kind of silence that feels impossible after chaos.

My ears rang.

My vision blurred.

I tasted blood.

I forced my eyes open.

Mark was slumped forward over the steering wheel.

Unmoving.

His head was turned slightly, and I could see a dark smear on his temple.

He was out.

Or dead.

I didn’t know.

I didn’t care.

I just knew I had seconds.

My hands shook as I twisted my wrists.

The bindings had loosened slightly in the crash.

I pulled, skin tearing, and finally one hand slipped free.

I sobbed, not from emotion, but from the relief of movement.

I clawed at the binding on my other wrist, ripping it apart.

Then my ankles.

My legs trembled as I pushed myself upright.

The car smelled like gasoline.

The front windshield was shattered.

The passenger side was crushed inward.

Cold air poured through broken glass.

I forced myself to breathe.

I leaned forward, reaching toward the center console.

And that’s when I saw it.

My phone.

Sitting inside the console, like Mark had tossed it there without thinking.

Like he assumed I’d never wake up.

My fingers closed around it.

The screen lit up.

I had service.

My hands were shaking so badly I almost dropped it.

I called Rachel.

She answered on the second ring.

“Sarah?” Rachel’s voice was bright, like she was smiling. “How was it?”

I couldn’t speak at first.

I just breathed.

Rachel’s voice changed instantly.

“Sarah?” she said again, sharper. “Sarah, what’s wrong?”

“He attacked me,” I whispered.

The words came out broken.

Rachel went silent.

“What?” she breathed.

“Mark,” I said. “He attacked me. He… he took me. Rachel, I’m on the side of the road. There was a crash. I don’t know where I am.”

Rachel’s voice turned into something I’d never heard from her.

Pure fear.

“Where are you?” she demanded.

“I don’t know,” I sobbed. “I don’t know, I just… I see trees. It’s dark. I’m cold.”

“Okay,” Rachel said quickly. “Okay. Stay on the phone. I’m calling Jacob. I’m coming right now. I’m calling the police too.”

“I already am,” I said, and my fingers moved automatically as I dialed 911.

Rachel stayed on the line until the dispatcher answered.

The police arrived first.

Their lights cut through the darkness, red and blue flashing across the trees.

An officer approached carefully, flashlight beam sweeping over the wreck.

I stumbled out of the car, arms wrapped around myself.

The cold air hit my bruised skin like fire.

The officer’s eyes widened when he saw my wrists.

The marks.

The blood.

The torn binding.

He spoke softly.

“Ma’am,” he said. “Are you Sarah Beth Jane?”

I nodded.

He turned toward the car, toward Mark slumped in the front seat.

His hand moved to his radio.

“Suspect is here,” he said quietly. “We need medical, and we need backup.”

Another officer approached Mark’s side.

They opened the door.

Mark groaned.

Alive.

The officer grabbed his arm, pulled him out.

Mark blinked, dazed.

Then his eyes found me.

And even with blood on his face, even with handcuffs being snapped onto his wrists, he smiled.

Like he still thought he’d won something.

Like this was just an inconvenience.

I wanted to vomit.

Rachel and Jacob arrived minutes later.

Rachel ran toward me, her coat flapping behind her.

She wrapped her arms around me so tightly I cried out, pain shooting through my ribs.

“I’m sorry,” she sobbed. “I’m so sorry, Sarah. I didn’t know. I swear I didn’t know.”

Jacob stood behind her, his face pale, eyes locked on Mark as the officers led him away.

Jacob’s jaw clenched.

He looked like he wanted to kill him.

I couldn’t stop shaking.

Rachel held my face in her hands.

“Sarah,” she whispered. “I swear on everything, I didn’t know.”

I believed her.

I did.

But I also couldn’t stop thinking about what Mark had said.

Rachel did a good job.

At the hospital, they cleaned my cuts and checked my ribs.

Bruised. Not broken.

They told me I was lucky.

They always say that.

Like survival is something you win.

Like it isn’t something you crawl through bleeding.

A detective came to speak with me early the next morning.

He introduced himself as Detective Lyle Harrow.

He was older, tired-eyed, with the kind of voice that sounded like he’d seen too many nights like mine.

He asked me to tell him everything.

I did.

Every detail.

Every question Mark asked.

Every moment where my instincts told me something was wrong and I ignored it.

When I finished, Detective Harrow sat quietly for a long time.

Then he spoke.

“Sarah,” he said, voice low, “I need you to understand something.”

I stared at him.

Mark’s face flashed in my mind.

The smile.

The needle.

The mirror.

Detective Harrow leaned forward.

“That man,” he said, “is wanted in three other states.”

My stomach dropped.

“For what?” I whispered.

Harrow’s eyes stayed on mine.

“Assault,” he said. “Kidnapping. Two cases where the women didn’t make it out.”

My throat tightened.

I felt like I couldn’t breathe.

“Why was he here?” I asked.

Detective Harrow exhaled slowly.

“He moves,” he said. “Changes names. Changes jobs. Keeps it simple.”

I thought of the café.

Rachel.

The warmth of that place.

The chalkboard menus.

The safe, normal life.

And Mark had walked right into it like he belonged.

“How did he choose me?” I whispered.

Detective Harrow didn’t answer right away.

Then he said something that still makes my stomach turn.

“He didn’t choose you randomly,” he said.

I stared at him.

Harrow continued.

“He chooses women who are in transition,” he said. “Women who just got out of long relationships. Women who are lonely. Women who don’t trust themselves anymore.”

My eyes burned.

“How do you know that?” I whispered.

Detective Harrow’s voice was quiet.

“Because that’s what the other victims had in common,” he said.

I felt my body go cold.

I thought of Mark’s questions.

Did he ever get physical?

Did you live together?

Why not?

What kind of damage am I dealing with?

He wasn’t being curious.

He was checking the locks on a door.

He was testing how much I’d tolerate.

He was making sure I was the right kind of vulnerable.

Rachel visited me later that day.

She looked like she hadn’t slept.

Her hair was pulled into a messy knot. Her eyes were red. She sat at the edge of my hospital bed like she didn’t know if she was allowed to be there.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered again.

I nodded.

“I know,” I said.

Rachel’s hands twisted together.

“He seemed so normal,” she said. “He was charming. He was funny. He was polite. He asked about you, Sarah. He asked me about you.”

My stomach clenched.

“What did you tell him?” I asked quietly.

Rachel froze.

Her eyes filled with tears.

“I told him you’d been through a lot,” she whispered. “I told him you deserved someone good. I told him… I told him you were strong.”

Her voice broke.

“I told him you were trying to heal.”

The words landed like a weight.

I stared at Rachel.

I didn’t blame her.

Not truly.

She didn’t do it maliciously.

She did it because she loved me.

But Mark didn’t hear those words the way Rachel meant them.

He heard them like coordinates.

Like a map.

Rachel reached for my hand.

“I didn’t know,” she whispered.

I squeezed her fingers.

“I know,” I said again.

But deep inside, something had changed.

Because I understood now that danger doesn’t always force its way into your life.

Sometimes you invite it in.

Not because you’re stupid.

Not because you’re reckless.

But because you are tired.

And you want to believe in something good again.

Mark Butler went to jail.

That’s the part people like.

The part where the story has a clean ending.

The part where the police arrive, the predator gets handcuffed, and the victim gets to go home.

But that isn’t the real ending.

The real ending is what happens after.

It’s the way you sit in your apartment with every light on.

It’s the way you check your locks twice.

It’s the way you hear footsteps in the hallway and your heart stops.

It’s the way you start wondering how many times you’ve walked past someone like Mark in a grocery store.

Smiling.

Normal.

Blending in.

The real ending is the realization Detective Harrow gave me without meaning to.

Mark didn’t need to know me.

He didn’t need to love me.

He didn’t even need to meet me.

He just needed to recognize the shape of my weakness.

And he did.

Because predators don’t always feel dangerous.

Sometimes they feel like exactly what you prayed for after being hurt.

And the most disturbing part is not that he attacked me.

It’s that for most of that night, I almost believed he was real.

When I think back on that date, I don’t remember the steak.

I don’t remember the pianist.

I don’t remember the candlelight.

I remember his questions.

I remember the way he watched me.

I remember the moment in the parking lot when my instincts screamed at me and I ignored them because I didn’t want to seem rude.

I didn’t want to be difficult.

I didn’t want to be the kind of woman who assumed the worst.

Now I understand something I wish I’d known sooner.

There are people in this world who learn how to wear kindness like a mask.

They learn how to speak softly.

They learn how to look safe.

And they go where women are trying to heal.

They go where women are trying to start over.

They go where women are trying to believe again.

Because it’s easier to take something from someone who is already exhausted.

And the most terrifying thing is not that Mark Butler existed.

It’s that men like him do.

Everywhere.

And sometimes they’re only one blind date away.",1,1771099982.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False
1r4ums7,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1r4ums7/the_perfect_candidate/,The Perfect Candidate,"I used to think the worst part of a breakup was the silence afterward.

The empty space where a voice used to be. The quiet in your phone. The way you stop hearing your own name said with any kind of warmth.

But that was before I learned there are worse kinds of silence.

The kind that happens when you realize you were never safe to begin with.

The kind that happens when you are sitting across from someone who is smiling at you, holding a wine glass like he belongs there, and you suddenly understand that the date is not the date.

It is an interview.

And you are the only person in the room who does not know what position you’re being considered for.

My name is Sarah Beth Jane.

I’m twenty-seven years old. I work as a medical billing specialist at a small outpatient clinic in a quiet town where nothing ever makes the news unless someone’s dog gets loose. I’m not the kind of person who ever wanted drama, and for a long time, I thought I had built a life that was calm enough to protect me from it.

A steady job. A small apartment. A handful of friends I trusted.

And for four years, I had a boyfriend named Tyler who seemed, on paper, like the kind of person you were supposed to end up with.

He never hit me.

That’s what I used to tell myself, like it meant something.

But he was still the kind of man who could destroy you without leaving bruises.

He’d make me feel stupid for laughing too loudly. He’d talk over me in public. He’d criticize the way I dressed, the way I spoke, the way I breathed, until I started shrinking into myself so gradually I didn’t even notice it happening.

He made me feel like love was something you earned by behaving correctly.

And when I finally ended it, after one last argument where he told me no one else would want me, I thought the hardest part was over.

I thought I’d survived the worst thing that could happen.

I didn’t know that all I’d done was make myself visible.

Rachel Marie Smith is the kind of best friend people write about in those soft, hopeful posts online.

She is warmth. She is noise. She is the person who will text you at 2:00 a.m. if she sees a funny video and thinks you need it. She works at a café downtown, the kind with handmade chalkboard menus and seasonal lattes, and she knows every regular by name.

Rachel has always believed that the world is better than it is.

I used to envy that.

After Tyler, I didn’t feel capable of believing in anything good anymore.

So when Rachel started pushing the idea of me going on a date again, I didn’t take her seriously at first.

“Sarah,” she said one afternoon while I sat at her café table with a half-finished cup of coffee, staring into it like it could answer my questions. “You can’t just… stop living.”

“I’m living,” I said.

“No, you’re surviving,” she corrected, leaning forward. Her eyes were bright, determined. “And you deserve better than that.”

I gave her a look that was meant to end the conversation.

She ignored it.

“I met someone,” she said.

My stomach tightened. “Rachel…”

“Not for me,” she said quickly. “For you.”

I let out a tired laugh. “Absolutely not.”

“His name is Mark Butler,” she said. “He’s new at the café. Just moved here. He’s sweet, he’s respectful, and Sarah… he is, like, offensively handsome.”

I stared at her.

“Rachel,” I said slowly. “I am not going on a blind date.”

“It’s not blind,” she argued. “It’s just… you haven’t met him yet.”

“That’s literally what blind means.”

She smiled like she’d already won.

“It’s Valentine’s Day,” she said. “You can either sit at home with Netflix and a frozen pizza, or you can go somewhere nice, have a good meal, and remember what it feels like to be treated like a human being.”

Something about the way she said that, treated like a human being, hit me harder than it should have.

Because Tyler had made me forget that love was supposed to feel like safety.

And Rachel, with her relentless optimism, was standing there offering me the idea that maybe the world still had good people in it.

I wanted to believe her.

That was my mistake.

I agreed under conditions.

One, it had to be a public place.

Two, it had to be a nice place, somewhere where people would be around.

Three, if I felt uncomfortable, I could leave. No guilt. No “just give him a chance.” No forcing me to be polite.

Rachel swore on everything she loved that she understood.

And then she texted me the reservation details.

A high-end restaurant on the edge of downtown, the kind with valet parking and soft lighting and tables set with cloth napkins folded into shapes that looked like art.

I stared at the name on my phone for a long time before replying.

“You’re insane.”

Rachel sent back three heart emojis and the words:

“Trust me.”

The night of Valentine’s Day, I stood in my bathroom for nearly twenty minutes, holding a curling iron like I didn’t remember how to use it.

It wasn’t that I wanted to impress him.

It was that I wanted to feel like myself again.

Tyler had made me feel like I was always too much, or not enough. Too emotional. Too sensitive. Too quiet. Too loud.

So I put on a simple black dress, nothing flashy, and a coat warm enough to handle the February air. I did my makeup the way I used to before Tyler started making comments about how I was “trying too hard.”

I looked at my reflection and tried to remember what confidence felt like.

Before I left, I texted Rachel:

“I’m going. If I get murdered, I’m haunting you.”

Rachel replied instantly:

“YOU’RE NOT GETTING MURDERED. HAVE FUN. TEXT ME WHEN YOU GET THERE.”

I stared at the word murdered on my screen.

Then I shoved my phone in my purse and left.

The restaurant was beautiful.

There’s no other word for it.

Warm golden light. Dark wood. Candle flames flickering on every table. A pianist in the corner playing something soft and slow. Couples leaning toward each other, laughing quietly.

I walked in and immediately felt underdressed.

A hostess asked for my name.

“Sarah,” I said, then corrected myself, because for some reason it felt important. “Sarah Beth Jane.”

She smiled and nodded, then led me toward a table near the back.

And that’s when I saw him.

Mark Butler stood as I approached, like he’d been trained to do it. Tall, broad shoulders, dark hair neatly styled. A suit jacket that fit him like it had been tailored. His smile was bright and practiced, but not in a way that felt fake.

In a way that felt… controlled.

“Sarah,” he said, and the way he said my name made me pause. Like he’d already said it in his head a hundred times.

“Hi,” I said, forcing myself to smile.

He leaned in for a hug. Not too close. Not too long. Just enough.

“I’m really glad you came,” he said.

His voice was calm. Warm. Low enough to feel intimate without being creepy.

Everything about him felt like the kind of man you’d describe as safe.

And that was the problem.

Because predators don’t look like monsters.

They look like someone you’d trust to walk you to your car.

For the first half of the date, it was perfect.

Mark asked me about my job. He listened like it mattered. He made small jokes, nothing crude, nothing forced. He told me he’d just moved to town for a fresh start, that he liked it here because it was quiet.

“I’m kind of done with big cities,” he said. “Too many people. Too many distractions.”

I nodded. “I get that.”

He smiled. “Rachel told me you’ve had a rough year.”

I froze slightly.

It wasn’t a big thing.

Friends talk.

But something about hearing it from him made my shoulders tense.

“Yeah,” I said carefully. “I guess you could say that.”

He tilted his head, watching me. “Four years, right?”

My stomach tightened.

I didn’t remember telling Rachel that exact number. I probably had. But the way he said it felt like he’d memorized it.

“Yeah,” I repeated. “Four.”

“That’s a long time,” he said. “Did you live together?”

I blinked. “No.”

“Why not?”

The question landed strangely.

Not curious. Not conversational.

It felt like a probe.

“I don’t know,” I said, trying to laugh it off. “It just never happened.”

He nodded slowly, like he was filing the answer away.

“What was he like?” Mark asked.

I stared at him.

The candlelight reflected in his eyes, making them look almost black.

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“Your ex,” he said smoothly. “Was he… intense?”

I shifted in my chair. “I don’t really like talking about him.”

Mark’s smile didn’t fade, but something about it changed.

“Of course,” he said quickly. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to push.”

He lifted his hands slightly, palms up, a gesture that looked harmless.

Then he leaned forward again, voice softer.

“I just think it matters,” he said. “Sometimes the kind of relationship you come out of affects what you accept afterward.”

My throat felt dry.

I took a sip of water, buying time.

“I guess,” I said.

Mark’s eyes stayed on me.

“What did he do?” he asked.

My pulse jumped.

I stared at him, waiting for the moment where he would realize he’d crossed a line.

But he didn’t.

He just watched me, calm, patient.

Like he knew silence would make me uncomfortable enough to fill it.

Tyler used to do that.

He used to ask questions until I felt trapped by them.

And suddenly, sitting across from Mark, I felt the old familiar pressure rising in my chest.

I forced myself to smile again.

“I’m sorry,” I said. “I just… I don’t want to make this date about him.”

Mark blinked, like he’d forgotten where he was.

Then he laughed lightly.

“You’re right,” he said. “That’s my fault. I got carried away.”

He leaned back, took a sip of his wine, and the tension seemed to evaporate.

Just like that.

He started talking about the restaurant, about the food, about how he’d never had steak that tender in his life.

He complimented my dress.

He told me I had a beautiful laugh.

And slowly, I started to feel ridiculous for being uneasy.

Because he was charming.

He was attentive.

He was everything Rachel promised.

Maybe I was just damaged.

Maybe Tyler had made me paranoid.

Maybe this was what normal dating felt like and I’d forgotten.

That’s what I told myself.

That was my second mistake.

By the time dessert arrived, the restaurant had thinned out.

The pianist had stopped playing. The candle flames seemed lower. The staff moved more quietly, cleaning tables and stacking chairs.

Mark and I sat with a shared chocolate soufflé between us.

He smiled.

“You’re different than I expected,” he said.

I frowned. “Different how?”

He hesitated, then shrugged. “Rachel said you were shy.”

“I am shy,” I said.

Mark shook his head slowly.

“No,” he said. “You’re careful.”

The way he said it made my stomach twist.

“What’s that supposed to mean?” I asked.

He smiled again, like he hadn’t said anything strange.

“It’s not a bad thing,” he said. “It’s smart.”

I tried to laugh, but it came out thin.

Mark glanced at his watch.

“It’s getting late,” he said. “Do you want to come back to my place? I have a bottle of wine that’s better than anything here.”

I felt my body tense immediately.

“No,” I said. “I’m sorry. I’m not really… I don’t do that.”

Mark’s expression didn’t change.

He nodded once.

“Of course,” he said. “I respect that.”

Relief flooded me.

Then he stood.

“Let me walk you to your car,” he said.

My relief hesitated.

I didn’t want to be rude.

And the parking lot was dark.

But the restaurant had valet, and my car was parked in the far section because I hadn’t wanted to pay extra.

Mark was already putting on his coat.

“It’s late,” he said. “And I’d feel better knowing you got there safe.”

That sentence.

That exact sentence.

It was the kind of sentence men used when they wanted to seem like protectors.

I nodded slowly.

“Okay,” I said.

And I stood.

The air outside was cold enough to sting.

The restaurant’s front entrance was bright, warm light spilling onto the sidewalk. But the parking lot beyond it was darker, only a few overhead lamps casting pale circles on the asphalt.

Mark walked beside me.

Not too close.

Just close enough.

“You had a good time?” he asked.

I hesitated.

“Yes,” I said. “I did.”

Mark smiled. “Good.”

We walked in silence for a few seconds.

Then Mark spoke again.

“So,” he said casually, “your ex… did he ever get physical?”

My stomach dropped.

I stopped walking.

Mark stopped too, turning toward me like he’d asked what my favorite movie was.

“What?” I said.

Mark blinked innocently.

“I’m sorry,” he said. “I know I said I’d stop. I just… it matters. You know? I need to know what kind of damage I’m dealing with.”

My skin went cold.

The words damage I’m dealing with hit me like a slap.

“Excuse me?” I said.

Mark’s smile flickered.

Just for a second.

Then it returned.

“I didn’t mean it like that,” he said. “I’m just saying, I care. I don’t want to accidentally trigger something.”

I stared at him.

The parking lot felt suddenly too quiet.

The restaurant doors were behind us, but far enough away that the warmth didn’t reach.

“I’m going to my car,” I said.

Mark’s eyes stayed on mine.

Then he nodded.

“Okay,” he said softly. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Sarah. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”

I swallowed.

I started walking again.

Mark followed.

My car was near the far edge of the lot, under a light that flickered slightly.

As I approached, I fumbled for my keys.

My fingers felt clumsy.

Mark stopped a few feet behind me.

“Sarah,” he said quietly.

I turned.

He was smiling again.

“Thank you for tonight,” he said. “I really enjoyed it.”

I forced a smile.

“Yeah,” I said. “Me too.”

I turned back toward my car.

And that’s when his hand closed around my wrist.

The grip was firm.

Not aggressive.

Just… certain.

I froze.

“Mark,” I said.

He didn’t respond.

His other hand came up fast.

Something cold pressed against the side of my neck.

A needle.

I didn’t even have time to scream.

The world tilted.

My knees buckled.

And the last thing I saw was Mark’s face close to mine, calm and focused, like he was doing something routine.

Like he’d done it before.

When I woke up, my mouth tasted like metal.

My head throbbed.

I tried to move and realized I was lying on my side, cramped, the air around me tight and stale.

A car.

I was in the back seat of a car.

My wrists were bound with something rough. My ankles too.

Panic hit like a wave.

I jerked, tried to sit up, but my head slammed into the seat.

I gasped.

The car was moving.

I could feel the vibration of the road.

I could hear the steady hum of tires on asphalt.

And in the front seat, I could see Mark’s silhouette.

Driving.

Calm.

Like nothing had happened.

My throat tightened.

“Mark,” I rasped.

He didn’t turn.

I swallowed hard, forcing my voice louder.

“Mark!”

He glanced in the rearview mirror.

His eyes met mine.

And he smiled.

Not the charming smile from the restaurant.

Something colder.

Something satisfied.

“You’re awake,” he said.

My body shook.

“Why are you doing this?” I whispered.

Mark’s voice stayed calm.

“Because you were perfect,” he said. “Rachel did a good job.”

My blood ran cold.

“Rachel,” I said. “Rachel doesn’t know anything.”

Mark chuckled.

“Oh, she knows,” he said. “Not what I’m doing. But she knows what you are.”

I stared at him, heart pounding.

“What I am?” I whispered.

Mark’s eyes flicked to the road.

“Broken,” he said. “Recently. Four years. Emotionally abused. No kids. No ring. No real ties.”

My stomach turned.

He was reciting my life like a checklist.

He kept talking.

“You were looking at me like I was a miracle,” he said. “Like I was sent to save you. That’s the best part.”

Tears burned in my eyes.

“You’re sick,” I said.

Mark laughed softly.

“No,” he said. “I’m experienced.”

My mind raced.

The bindings on my wrists were tight, but not perfect.

I twisted, trying to find slack.

My fingers scraped against the rough material.

I could feel it cutting into my skin.

Mark’s car smelled like clean leather and cologne.

Everything about him, even his vehicle, felt carefully chosen.

Like he’d built a life that looked normal enough to hide in.

I shifted my legs, testing the bindings at my ankles.

Mark’s voice drifted back to me.

“You know what’s funny?” he said.

I didn’t respond.

Mark continued anyway.

“Women always say they want a nice guy,” he said. “And then when one shows up, they think it’s too good to be true.”

My throat tightened.

Mark’s eyes met mine again in the mirror.

“And it is,” he said softly.

I don’t know what part of me decided to fight.

Maybe it was survival.

Maybe it was rage.

Maybe it was the memory of Tyler telling me no one else would want me.

Maybe it was the sick understanding that Mark had chosen me because he thought I’d be easy.

But something snapped in my chest.

I lunged forward.

My bound wrists slammed into the back of his seat.

Mark cursed, startled.

I kicked wildly, my heel striking his shoulder.

The car swerved.

Mark shouted, trying to control it.

I kicked again, harder, catching him in the side of the head.

The car jerked.

We were on a suburban road, trees on either side, no streetlights, just the dark and the pale glow of the headlights.

Mark fought the steering wheel.

“Stop!” he yelled.

I didn’t.

I slammed my body forward again, using everything I had.

The car veered.

The tires hit gravel.

The world spun.

Then the sound came.

A violent crash.

Metal shrieking.

Glass exploding.

My body slammed against the seat.

Pain flared in my ribs.

The car lurched, spun, and stopped.

Silence followed.

The kind of silence that feels impossible after chaos.

My ears rang.

My vision blurred.

I tasted blood.

I forced my eyes open.

Mark was slumped forward over the steering wheel.

Unmoving.

His head was turned slightly, and I could see a dark smear on his temple.

He was out.

Or dead.

I didn’t know.

I didn’t care.

I just knew I had seconds.

My hands shook as I twisted my wrists.

The bindings had loosened slightly in the crash.

I pulled, skin tearing, and finally one hand slipped free.

I sobbed, not from emotion, but from the relief of movement.

I clawed at the binding on my other wrist, ripping it apart.

Then my ankles.

My legs trembled as I pushed myself upright.

The car smelled like gasoline.

The front windshield was shattered.

The passenger side was crushed inward.

Cold air poured through broken glass.

I forced myself to breathe.

I leaned forward, reaching toward the center console.

And that’s when I saw it.

My phone.

Sitting inside the console, like Mark had tossed it there without thinking.

Like he assumed I’d never wake up.

My fingers closed around it.

The screen lit up.

I had service.

My hands were shaking so badly I almost dropped it.

I called Rachel.

She answered on the second ring.

“Sarah?” Rachel’s voice was bright, like she was smiling. “How was it?”

I couldn’t speak at first.

I just breathed.

Rachel’s voice changed instantly.

“Sarah?” she said again, sharper. “Sarah, what’s wrong?”

“He attacked me,” I whispered.

The words came out broken.

Rachel went silent.

“What?” she breathed.

“Mark,” I said. “He attacked me. He… he took me. Rachel, I’m on the side of the road. There was a crash. I don’t know where I am.”

Rachel’s voice turned into something I’d never heard from her.

Pure fear.

“Where are you?” she demanded.

“I don’t know,” I sobbed. “I don’t know, I just… I see trees. It’s dark. I’m cold.”

“Okay,” Rachel said quickly. “Okay. Stay on the phone. I’m calling Jacob. I’m coming right now. I’m calling the police too.”

“I already am,” I said, and my fingers moved automatically as I dialed 911.

Rachel stayed on the line until the dispatcher answered.

The police arrived first.

Their lights cut through the darkness, red and blue flashing across the trees.

An officer approached carefully, flashlight beam sweeping over the wreck.

I stumbled out of the car, arms wrapped around myself.

The cold air hit my bruised skin like fire.

The officer’s eyes widened when he saw my wrists.

The marks.

The blood.

The torn binding.

He spoke softly.

“Ma’am,” he said. “Are you Sarah Beth Jane?”

I nodded.

He turned toward the car, toward Mark slumped in the front seat.

His hand moved to his radio.

“Suspect is here,” he said quietly. “We need medical, and we need backup.”

Another officer approached Mark’s side.

They opened the door.

Mark groaned.

Alive.

The officer grabbed his arm, pulled him out.

Mark blinked, dazed.

Then his eyes found me.

And even with blood on his face, even with handcuffs being snapped onto his wrists, he smiled.

Like he still thought he’d won something.

Like this was just an inconvenience.

I wanted to vomit.

Rachel and Jacob arrived minutes later.

Rachel ran toward me, her coat flapping behind her.

She wrapped her arms around me so tightly I cried out, pain shooting through my ribs.

“I’m sorry,” she sobbed. “I’m so sorry, Sarah. I didn’t know. I swear I didn’t know.”

Jacob stood behind her, his face pale, eyes locked on Mark as the officers led him away.

Jacob’s jaw clenched.

He looked like he wanted to kill him.

I couldn’t stop shaking.

Rachel held my face in her hands.

“Sarah,” she whispered. “I swear on everything, I didn’t know.”

I believed her.

I did.

But I also couldn’t stop thinking about what Mark had said.

Rachel did a good job.

At the hospital, they cleaned my cuts and checked my ribs.

Bruised. Not broken.

They told me I was lucky.

They always say that.

Like survival is something you win.

Like it isn’t something you crawl through bleeding.

A detective came to speak with me early the next morning.

He introduced himself as Detective Lyle Harrow.

He was older, tired-eyed, with the kind of voice that sounded like he’d seen too many nights like mine.

He asked me to tell him everything.

I did.

Every detail.

Every question Mark asked.

Every moment where my instincts told me something was wrong and I ignored it.

When I finished, Detective Harrow sat quietly for a long time.

Then he spoke.

“Sarah,” he said, voice low, “I need you to understand something.”

I stared at him.

Mark’s face flashed in my mind.

The smile.

The needle.

The mirror.

Detective Harrow leaned forward.

“That man,” he said, “is wanted in three other states.”

My stomach dropped.

“For what?” I whispered.

Harrow’s eyes stayed on mine.

“Assault,” he said. “Kidnapping. Two cases where the women didn’t make it out.”

My throat tightened.

I felt like I couldn’t breathe.

“Why was he here?” I asked.

Detective Harrow exhaled slowly.

“He moves,” he said. “Changes names. Changes jobs. Keeps it simple.”

I thought of the café.

Rachel.

The warmth of that place.

The chalkboard menus.

The safe, normal life.

And Mark had walked right into it like he belonged.

“How did he choose me?” I whispered.

Detective Harrow didn’t answer right away.

Then he said something that still makes my stomach turn.

“He didn’t choose you randomly,” he said.

I stared at him.

Harrow continued.

“He chooses women who are in transition,” he said. “Women who just got out of long relationships. Women who are lonely. Women who don’t trust themselves anymore.”

My eyes burned.

“How do you know that?” I whispered.

Detective Harrow’s voice was quiet.

“Because that’s what the other victims had in common,” he said.

I felt my body go cold.

I thought of Mark’s questions.

Did he ever get physical?

Did you live together?

Why not?

What kind of damage am I dealing with?

He wasn’t being curious.

He was checking the locks on a door.

He was testing how much I’d tolerate.

He was making sure I was the right kind of vulnerable.

Rachel visited me later that day.

She looked like she hadn’t slept.

Her hair was pulled into a messy knot. Her eyes were red. She sat at the edge of my hospital bed like she didn’t know if she was allowed to be there.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered again.

I nodded.

“I know,” I said.

Rachel’s hands twisted together.

“He seemed so normal,” she said. “He was charming. He was funny. He was polite. He asked about you, Sarah. He asked me about you.”

My stomach clenched.

“What did you tell him?” I asked quietly.

Rachel froze.

Her eyes filled with tears.

“I told him you’d been through a lot,” she whispered. “I told him you deserved someone good. I told him… I told him you were strong.”

Her voice broke.

“I told him you were trying to heal.”

The words landed like a weight.

I stared at Rachel.

I didn’t blame her.

Not truly.

She didn’t do it maliciously.

She did it because she loved me.

But Mark didn’t hear those words the way Rachel meant them.

He heard them like coordinates.

Like a map.

Rachel reached for my hand.

“I didn’t know,” she whispered.

I squeezed her fingers.

“I know,” I said again.

But deep inside, something had changed.

Because I understood now that danger doesn’t always force its way into your life.

Sometimes you invite it in.

Not because you’re stupid.

Not because you’re reckless.

But because you are tired.

And you want to believe in something good again.

Mark Butler went to jail.

That’s the part people like.

The part where the story has a clean ending.

The part where the police arrive, the predator gets handcuffed, and the victim gets to go home.

But that isn’t the real ending.

The real ending is what happens after.

It’s the way you sit in your apartment with every light on.

It’s the way you check your locks twice.

It’s the way you hear footsteps in the hallway and your heart stops.

It’s the way you start wondering how many times you’ve walked past someone like Mark in a grocery store.

Smiling.

Normal.

Blending in.

The real ending is the realization Detective Harrow gave me without meaning to.

Mark didn’t need to know me.

He didn’t need to love me.

He didn’t even need to meet me.

He just needed to recognize the shape of my weakness.

And he did.

Because predators don’t always feel dangerous.

Sometimes they feel like exactly what you prayed for after being hurt.

And the most disturbing part is not that he attacked me.

It’s that for most of that night, I almost believed he was real.

When I think back on that date, I don’t remember the steak.

I don’t remember the pianist.

I don’t remember the candlelight.

I remember his questions.

I remember the way he watched me.

I remember the moment in the parking lot when my instincts screamed at me and I ignored them because I didn’t want to seem rude.

I didn’t want to be difficult.

I didn’t want to be the kind of woman who assumed the worst.

Now I understand something I wish I’d known sooner.

There are people in this world who learn how to wear kindness like a mask.

They learn how to speak softly.

They learn how to look safe.

And they go where women are trying to heal.

They go where women are trying to start over.

They go where women are trying to believe again.

Because it’s easier to take something from someone who is already exhausted.

And the most terrifying thing is not that Mark Butler existed.

It’s that men like him do.

Everywhere.

And sometimes they’re only one blind date away.",1,1771099957.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False
1r4umhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1r4umhf/i_have_never_felt_more_alone_in_this_marriage/,I have never felt more alone in this marriage,"My husband and I got married very young, 22 and 23. We were college sweethearts and due to our religious Islamic background, were pressured into getting married after four years of dating.

This year will be our fifth marriage anniversary, our total of nine years together. We are 28 and 27 now.

I love him so much, we are each others firsts.

But I find myself crying today and asking myself how it went so wrong.

A bit of background info: He comes from a family who immigrated back in 2014. He lives with his parents and his younger brother. He’s known nothing but making money. He’s a very hard worker. He works seven days a week, adding in a weekend job on top of his professional job. He continues working so that we can save up for a house together.

I work in a corporate job too, but five days. I’ve lived in the states my whole life. I’ve always lived a comfortable life. My dad had several businesses so money never was a concern to me.

My friends group, which consists of mostly my close friends and their husbands, always have plans in the weekend. Nothing too crazy, maybe just a Yemeni coffee run or an hour drive to the next city once in a while. He hardly joins because of work, but he never complains or even shows much interest. I go to these alone.

We don’t go on dates. Special occasions only, though last year I opted out for my birthday, since he is always talking about spending money. He was willing and kept suggesting that we do dinner, but I declined. I knew it was going to be a lot of money. I went to work that day and my sister and family surprised me at the house. He joined too.

We live separately most of the time. My job is 15 minutes from my parents house and he lives with his parents, which is 40 minutes away so it’s convenient for me to stay here. I hardly go visit ever since I started my new job. He never says he misses me. He always checks up on me though but won’t visit me. He asks what’s the point of driving? Even when I try to come drive to him for a bit of time and then drive back to mine, he says there’s no point. So I don’t visit him. I sleep alone most of the time.

Intimacy is a big thing for me. If we’re not intimate I start to overthink and think I’m not attractive. He’s hardy intimate even when we finally see each other. I don’t think he’s that attracted to me anymore. I’ve talked to him about this countless times, but he says it’s because he’s tired. So I just started to keep these thoughts to myself.

We go on trips but not often. When we do, it’s with our friends so that it’s cheaper. They do group trips as well as trips with just their spouses for quality time, but I don’t really get that.

Today is Valentine’s Day. While my sister’s husband planned a getaway in another city, while my friends husbands bought them flowers and took them on dates, i asked asked to go to the beach. Romantic, cheap- so that we wouldn’t spend too much money. But something came up and he had to cancel, apologizing a lot and asking if it’s okay if we go the next day. I said it’s fine, even though it’s not even Valentine’s Day. At least we will get to spend time with each other.

He has been amazing, which is why I feel so guilty writing this. He is a very good person, genuine and kind. Prior to November last year, I took a year off from work. I had a very stressful corporate job that took toll on both my mental and physical health. I took six months to get better and focus on my wellbeing, and it took me another six months to actually find a job. He financially supported me every step of the way. He budgeted of course but made sure I got to do the things I wanted. I can’t ever repay him for that.

I feel like… this marriage is just getting worse. I feel trapped. There is no romance, no excitement. There’s only a lot of love from both ends, but I think money has really pushed down on this marriage and ruined it. I’m surrounded by friends and their husbands who go on so many trips together and genuinely enjoy each others company. I have tried talking but it feels like a brick wall. He brushes it off, having bigger financial problems. I feel like I’m screaming and he doesn’t hear it. I don’t feel like he’s in love with me, he just loves me, like a family member he has to support. It’s like he just focuses on the “needs” so much, but not really the “wants”. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I was a different person back then. I would have never said no to doing big dinners and nice trips.

I feel like this whole thing is temporary, that once we buy a house together and live together, we will have quality time and we will be okay. But a part of me is terrified that we’ll get to that point and it won’t work.",1,1771099938.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False
1r4ulus,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1r4ulus/the_perfect_candidate/,The Perfect Candidate,"I used to think the worst part of a breakup was the silence afterward.

The empty space where a voice used to be. The quiet in your phone. The way you stop hearing your own name said with any kind of warmth.

But that was before I learned there are worse kinds of silence.

The kind that happens when you realize you were never safe to begin with.

The kind that happens when you are sitting across from someone who is smiling at you, holding a wine glass like he belongs there, and you suddenly understand that the date is not the date.

It is an interview.

And you are the only person in the room who does not know what position you’re being considered for.

My name is Sarah Beth Jane.

I’m twenty-seven years old. I work as a medical billing specialist at a small outpatient clinic in a quiet town where nothing ever makes the news unless someone’s dog gets loose. I’m not the kind of person who ever wanted drama, and for a long time, I thought I had built a life that was calm enough to protect me from it.

A steady job. A small apartment. A handful of friends I trusted.

And for four years, I had a boyfriend named Tyler who seemed, on paper, like the kind of person you were supposed to end up with.

He never hit me.

That’s what I used to tell myself, like it meant something.

But he was still the kind of man who could destroy you without leaving bruises.

He’d make me feel stupid for laughing too loudly. He’d talk over me in public. He’d criticize the way I dressed, the way I spoke, the way I breathed, until I started shrinking into myself so gradually I didn’t even notice it happening.

He made me feel like love was something you earned by behaving correctly.

And when I finally ended it, after one last argument where he told me no one else would want me, I thought the hardest part was over.

I thought I’d survived the worst thing that could happen.

I didn’t know that all I’d done was make myself visible.

Rachel Marie Smith is the kind of best friend people write about in those soft, hopeful posts online.

She is warmth. She is noise. She is the person who will text you at 2:00 a.m. if she sees a funny video and thinks you need it. She works at a café downtown, the kind with handmade chalkboard menus and seasonal lattes, and she knows every regular by name.

Rachel has always believed that the world is better than it is.

I used to envy that.

After Tyler, I didn’t feel capable of believing in anything good anymore.

So when Rachel started pushing the idea of me going on a date again, I didn’t take her seriously at first.

“Sarah,” she said one afternoon while I sat at her café table with a half-finished cup of coffee, staring into it like it could answer my questions. “You can’t just… stop living.”

“I’m living,” I said.

“No, you’re surviving,” she corrected, leaning forward. Her eyes were bright, determined. “And you deserve better than that.”

I gave her a look that was meant to end the conversation.

She ignored it.

“I met someone,” she said.

My stomach tightened. “Rachel…”

“Not for me,” she said quickly. “For you.”

I let out a tired laugh. “Absolutely not.”

“His name is Mark Butler,” she said. “He’s new at the café. Just moved here. He’s sweet, he’s respectful, and Sarah… he is, like, offensively handsome.”

I stared at her.

“Rachel,” I said slowly. “I am not going on a blind date.”

“It’s not blind,” she argued. “It’s just… you haven’t met him yet.”

“That’s literally what blind means.”

She smiled like she’d already won.

“It’s Valentine’s Day,” she said. “You can either sit at home with Netflix and a frozen pizza, or you can go somewhere nice, have a good meal, and remember what it feels like to be treated like a human being.”

Something about the way she said that, treated like a human being, hit me harder than it should have.

Because Tyler had made me forget that love was supposed to feel like safety.

And Rachel, with her relentless optimism, was standing there offering me the idea that maybe the world still had good people in it.

I wanted to believe her.

That was my mistake.

I agreed under conditions.

One, it had to be a public place.

Two, it had to be a nice place, somewhere where people would be around.

Three, if I felt uncomfortable, I could leave. No guilt. No “just give him a chance.” No forcing me to be polite.

Rachel swore on everything she loved that she understood.

And then she texted me the reservation details.

A high-end restaurant on the edge of downtown, the kind with valet parking and soft lighting and tables set with cloth napkins folded into shapes that looked like art.

I stared at the name on my phone for a long time before replying.

“You’re insane.”

Rachel sent back three heart emojis and the words:

“Trust me.”

The night of Valentine’s Day, I stood in my bathroom for nearly twenty minutes, holding a curling iron like I didn’t remember how to use it.

It wasn’t that I wanted to impress him.

It was that I wanted to feel like myself again.

Tyler had made me feel like I was always too much, or not enough. Too emotional. Too sensitive. Too quiet. Too loud.

So I put on a simple black dress, nothing flashy, and a coat warm enough to handle the February air. I did my makeup the way I used to before Tyler started making comments about how I was “trying too hard.”

I looked at my reflection and tried to remember what confidence felt like.

Before I left, I texted Rachel:

“I’m going. If I get murdered, I’m haunting you.”

Rachel replied instantly:

“YOU’RE NOT GETTING MURDERED. HAVE FUN. TEXT ME WHEN YOU GET THERE.”

I stared at the word murdered on my screen.

Then I shoved my phone in my purse and left.

The restaurant was beautiful.

There’s no other word for it.

Warm golden light. Dark wood. Candle flames flickering on every table. A pianist in the corner playing something soft and slow. Couples leaning toward each other, laughing quietly.

I walked in and immediately felt underdressed.

A hostess asked for my name.

“Sarah,” I said, then corrected myself, because for some reason it felt important. “Sarah Beth Jane.”

She smiled and nodded, then led me toward a table near the back.

And that’s when I saw him.

Mark Butler stood as I approached, like he’d been trained to do it. Tall, broad shoulders, dark hair neatly styled. A suit jacket that fit him like it had been tailored. His smile was bright and practiced, but not in a way that felt fake.

In a way that felt… controlled.

“Sarah,” he said, and the way he said my name made me pause. Like he’d already said it in his head a hundred times.

“Hi,” I said, forcing myself to smile.

He leaned in for a hug. Not too close. Not too long. Just enough.

“I’m really glad you came,” he said.

His voice was calm. Warm. Low enough to feel intimate without being creepy.

Everything about him felt like the kind of man you’d describe as safe.

And that was the problem.

Because predators don’t look like monsters.

They look like someone you’d trust to walk you to your car.

For the first half of the date, it was perfect.

Mark asked me about my job. He listened like it mattered. He made small jokes, nothing crude, nothing forced. He told me he’d just moved to town for a fresh start, that he liked it here because it was quiet.

“I’m kind of done with big cities,” he said. “Too many people. Too many distractions.”

I nodded. “I get that.”

He smiled. “Rachel told me you’ve had a rough year.”

I froze slightly.

It wasn’t a big thing.

Friends talk.

But something about hearing it from him made my shoulders tense.

“Yeah,” I said carefully. “I guess you could say that.”

He tilted his head, watching me. “Four years, right?”

My stomach tightened.

I didn’t remember telling Rachel that exact number. I probably had. But the way he said it felt like he’d memorized it.

“Yeah,” I repeated. “Four.”

“That’s a long time,” he said. “Did you live together?”

I blinked. “No.”

“Why not?”

The question landed strangely.

Not curious. Not conversational.

It felt like a probe.

“I don’t know,” I said, trying to laugh it off. “It just never happened.”

He nodded slowly, like he was filing the answer away.

“What was he like?” Mark asked.

I stared at him.

The candlelight reflected in his eyes, making them look almost black.

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“Your ex,” he said smoothly. “Was he… intense?”

I shifted in my chair. “I don’t really like talking about him.”

Mark’s smile didn’t fade, but something about it changed.

“Of course,” he said quickly. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to push.”

He lifted his hands slightly, palms up, a gesture that looked harmless.

Then he leaned forward again, voice softer.

“I just think it matters,” he said. “Sometimes the kind of relationship you come out of affects what you accept afterward.”

My throat felt dry.

I took a sip of water, buying time.

“I guess,” I said.

Mark’s eyes stayed on me.

“What did he do?” he asked.

My pulse jumped.

I stared at him, waiting for the moment where he would realize he’d crossed a line.

But he didn’t.

He just watched me, calm, patient.

Like he knew silence would make me uncomfortable enough to fill it.

Tyler used to do that.

He used to ask questions until I felt trapped by them.

And suddenly, sitting across from Mark, I felt the old familiar pressure rising in my chest.

I forced myself to smile again.

“I’m sorry,” I said. “I just… I don’t want to make this date about him.”

Mark blinked, like he’d forgotten where he was.

Then he laughed lightly.

“You’re right,” he said. “That’s my fault. I got carried away.”

He leaned back, took a sip of his wine, and the tension seemed to evaporate.

Just like that.

He started talking about the restaurant, about the food, about how he’d never had steak that tender in his life.

He complimented my dress.

He told me I had a beautiful laugh.

And slowly, I started to feel ridiculous for being uneasy.

Because he was charming.

He was attentive.

He was everything Rachel promised.

Maybe I was just damaged.

Maybe Tyler had made me paranoid.

Maybe this was what normal dating felt like and I’d forgotten.

That’s what I told myself.

That was my second mistake.

By the time dessert arrived, the restaurant had thinned out.

The pianist had stopped playing. The candle flames seemed lower. The staff moved more quietly, cleaning tables and stacking chairs.

Mark and I sat with a shared chocolate soufflé between us.

He smiled.

“You’re different than I expected,” he said.

I frowned. “Different how?”

He hesitated, then shrugged. “Rachel said you were shy.”

“I am shy,” I said.

Mark shook his head slowly.

“No,” he said. “You’re careful.”

The way he said it made my stomach twist.

“What’s that supposed to mean?” I asked.

He smiled again, like he hadn’t said anything strange.

“It’s not a bad thing,” he said. “It’s smart.”

I tried to laugh, but it came out thin.

Mark glanced at his watch.

“It’s getting late,” he said. “Do you want to come back to my place? I have a bottle of wine that’s better than anything here.”

I felt my body tense immediately.

“No,” I said. “I’m sorry. I’m not really… I don’t do that.”

Mark’s expression didn’t change.

He nodded once.

“Of course,” he said. “I respect that.”

Relief flooded me.

Then he stood.

“Let me walk you to your car,” he said.

My relief hesitated.

I didn’t want to be rude.

And the parking lot was dark.

But the restaurant had valet, and my car was parked in the far section because I hadn’t wanted to pay extra.

Mark was already putting on his coat.

“It’s late,” he said. “And I’d feel better knowing you got there safe.”

That sentence.

That exact sentence.

It was the kind of sentence men used when they wanted to seem like protectors.

I nodded slowly.

“Okay,” I said.

And I stood.

The air outside was cold enough to sting.

The restaurant’s front entrance was bright, warm light spilling onto the sidewalk. But the parking lot beyond it was darker, only a few overhead lamps casting pale circles on the asphalt.

Mark walked beside me.

Not too close.

Just close enough.

“You had a good time?” he asked.

I hesitated.

“Yes,” I said. “I did.”

Mark smiled. “Good.”

We walked in silence for a few seconds.

Then Mark spoke again.

“So,” he said casually, “your ex… did he ever get physical?”

My stomach dropped.

I stopped walking.

Mark stopped too, turning toward me like he’d asked what my favorite movie was.

“What?” I said.

Mark blinked innocently.

“I’m sorry,” he said. “I know I said I’d stop. I just… it matters. You know? I need to know what kind of damage I’m dealing with.”

My skin went cold.

The words damage I’m dealing with hit me like a slap.

“Excuse me?” I said.

Mark’s smile flickered.

Just for a second.

Then it returned.

“I didn’t mean it like that,” he said. “I’m just saying, I care. I don’t want to accidentally trigger something.”

I stared at him.

The parking lot felt suddenly too quiet.

The restaurant doors were behind us, but far enough away that the warmth didn’t reach.

“I’m going to my car,” I said.

Mark’s eyes stayed on mine.

Then he nodded.

“Okay,” he said softly. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Sarah. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”

I swallowed.

I started walking again.

Mark followed.

My car was near the far edge of the lot, under a light that flickered slightly.

As I approached, I fumbled for my keys.

My fingers felt clumsy.

Mark stopped a few feet behind me.

“Sarah,” he said quietly.

I turned.

He was smiling again.

“Thank you for tonight,” he said. “I really enjoyed it.”

I forced a smile.

“Yeah,” I said. “Me too.”

I turned back toward my car.

And that’s when his hand closed around my wrist.

The grip was firm.

Not aggressive.

Just… certain.

I froze.

“Mark,” I said.

He didn’t respond.

His other hand came up fast.

Something cold pressed against the side of my neck.

A needle.

I didn’t even have time to scream.

The world tilted.

My knees buckled.

And the last thing I saw was Mark’s face close to mine, calm and focused, like he was doing something routine.

Like he’d done it before.

When I woke up, my mouth tasted like metal.

My head throbbed.

I tried to move and realized I was lying on my side, cramped, the air around me tight and stale.

A car.

I was in the back seat of a car.

My wrists were bound with something rough. My ankles too.

Panic hit like a wave.

I jerked, tried to sit up, but my head slammed into the seat.

I gasped.

The car was moving.

I could feel the vibration of the road.

I could hear the steady hum of tires on asphalt.

And in the front seat, I could see Mark’s silhouette.

Driving.

Calm.

Like nothing had happened.

My throat tightened.

“Mark,” I rasped.

He didn’t turn.

I swallowed hard, forcing my voice louder.

“Mark!”

He glanced in the rearview mirror.

His eyes met mine.

And he smiled.

Not the charming smile from the restaurant.

Something colder.

Something satisfied.

“You’re awake,” he said.

My body shook.

“Why are you doing this?” I whispered.

Mark’s voice stayed calm.

“Because you were perfect,” he said. “Rachel did a good job.”

My blood ran cold.

“Rachel,” I said. “Rachel doesn’t know anything.”

Mark chuckled.

“Oh, she knows,” he said. “Not what I’m doing. But she knows what you are.”

I stared at him, heart pounding.

“What I am?” I whispered.

Mark’s eyes flicked to the road.

“Broken,” he said. “Recently. Four years. Emotionally abused. No kids. No ring. No real ties.”

My stomach turned.

He was reciting my life like a checklist.

He kept talking.

“You were looking at me like I was a miracle,” he said. “Like I was sent to save you. That’s the best part.”

Tears burned in my eyes.

“You’re sick,” I said.

Mark laughed softly.

“No,” he said. “I’m experienced.”

My mind raced.

The bindings on my wrists were tight, but not perfect.

I twisted, trying to find slack.

My fingers scraped against the rough material.

I could feel it cutting into my skin.

Mark’s car smelled like clean leather and cologne.

Everything about him, even his vehicle, felt carefully chosen.

Like he’d built a life that looked normal enough to hide in.

I shifted my legs, testing the bindings at my ankles.

Mark’s voice drifted back to me.

“You know what’s funny?” he said.

I didn’t respond.

Mark continued anyway.

“Women always say they want a nice guy,” he said. “And then when one shows up, they think it’s too good to be true.”

My throat tightened.

Mark’s eyes met mine again in the mirror.

“And it is,” he said softly.

I don’t know what part of me decided to fight.

Maybe it was survival.

Maybe it was rage.

Maybe it was the memory of Tyler telling me no one else would want me.

Maybe it was the sick understanding that Mark had chosen me because he thought I’d be easy.

But something snapped in my chest.

I lunged forward.

My bound wrists slammed into the back of his seat.

Mark cursed, startled.

I kicked wildly, my heel striking his shoulder.

The car swerved.

Mark shouted, trying to control it.

I kicked again, harder, catching him in the side of the head.

The car jerked.

We were on a suburban road, trees on either side, no streetlights, just the dark and the pale glow of the headlights.

Mark fought the steering wheel.

“Stop!” he yelled.

I didn’t.

I slammed my body forward again, using everything I had.

The car veered.

The tires hit gravel.

The world spun.

Then the sound came.

A violent crash.

Metal shrieking.

Glass exploding.

My body slammed against the seat.

Pain flared in my ribs.

The car lurched, spun, and stopped.

Silence followed.

The kind of silence that feels impossible after chaos.

My ears rang.

My vision blurred.

I tasted blood.

I forced my eyes open.

Mark was slumped forward over the steering wheel.

Unmoving.

His head was turned slightly, and I could see a dark smear on his temple.

He was out.

Or dead.

I didn’t know.

I didn’t care.

I just knew I had seconds.

My hands shook as I twisted my wrists.

The bindings had loosened slightly in the crash.

I pulled, skin tearing, and finally one hand slipped free.

I sobbed, not from emotion, but from the relief of movement.

I clawed at the binding on my other wrist, ripping it apart.

Then my ankles.

My legs trembled as I pushed myself upright.

The car smelled like gasoline.

The front windshield was shattered.

The passenger side was crushed inward.

Cold air poured through broken glass.

I forced myself to breathe.

I leaned forward, reaching toward the center console.

And that’s when I saw it.

My phone.

Sitting inside the console, like Mark had tossed it there without thinking.

Like he assumed I’d never wake up.

My fingers closed around it.

The screen lit up.

I had service.

My hands were shaking so badly I almost dropped it.

I called Rachel.

She answered on the second ring.

“Sarah?” Rachel’s voice was bright, like she was smiling. “How was it?”

I couldn’t speak at first.

I just breathed.

Rachel’s voice changed instantly.

“Sarah?” she said again, sharper. “Sarah, what’s wrong?”

“He attacked me,” I whispered.

The words came out broken.

Rachel went silent.

“What?” she breathed.

“Mark,” I said. “He attacked me. He… he took me. Rachel, I’m on the side of the road. There was a crash. I don’t know where I am.”

Rachel’s voice turned into something I’d never heard from her.

Pure fear.

“Where are you?” she demanded.

“I don’t know,” I sobbed. “I don’t know, I just… I see trees. It’s dark. I’m cold.”

“Okay,” Rachel said quickly. “Okay. Stay on the phone. I’m calling Jacob. I’m coming right now. I’m calling the police too.”

“I already am,” I said, and my fingers moved automatically as I dialed 911.

Rachel stayed on the line until the dispatcher answered.

The police arrived first.

Their lights cut through the darkness, red and blue flashing across the trees.

An officer approached carefully, flashlight beam sweeping over the wreck.

I stumbled out of the car, arms wrapped around myself.

The cold air hit my bruised skin like fire.

The officer’s eyes widened when he saw my wrists.

The marks.

The blood.

The torn binding.

He spoke softly.

“Ma’am,” he said. “Are you Sarah Beth Jane?”

I nodded.

He turned toward the car, toward Mark slumped in the front seat.

His hand moved to his radio.

“Suspect is here,” he said quietly. “We need medical, and we need backup.”

Another officer approached Mark’s side.

They opened the door.

Mark groaned.

Alive.

The officer grabbed his arm, pulled him out.

Mark blinked, dazed.

Then his eyes found me.

And even with blood on his face, even with handcuffs being snapped onto his wrists, he smiled.

Like he still thought he’d won something.

Like this was just an inconvenience.

I wanted to vomit.

Rachel and Jacob arrived minutes later.

Rachel ran toward me, her coat flapping behind her.

She wrapped her arms around me so tightly I cried out, pain shooting through my ribs.

“I’m sorry,” she sobbed. “I’m so sorry, Sarah. I didn’t know. I swear I didn’t know.”

Jacob stood behind her, his face pale, eyes locked on Mark as the officers led him away.

Jacob’s jaw clenched.

He looked like he wanted to kill him.

I couldn’t stop shaking.

Rachel held my face in her hands.

“Sarah,” she whispered. “I swear on everything, I didn’t know.”

I believed her.

I did.

But I also couldn’t stop thinking about what Mark had said.

Rachel did a good job.

At the hospital, they cleaned my cuts and checked my ribs.

Bruised. Not broken.

They told me I was lucky.

They always say that.

Like survival is something you win.

Like it isn’t something you crawl through bleeding.

A detective came to speak with me early the next morning.

He introduced himself as Detective Lyle Harrow.

He was older, tired-eyed, with the kind of voice that sounded like he’d seen too many nights like mine.

He asked me to tell him everything.

I did.

Every detail.

Every question Mark asked.

Every moment where my instincts told me something was wrong and I ignored it.

When I finished, Detective Harrow sat quietly for a long time.

Then he spoke.

“Sarah,” he said, voice low, “I need you to understand something.”

I stared at him.

Mark’s face flashed in my mind.

The smile.

The needle.

The mirror.

Detective Harrow leaned forward.

“That man,” he said, “is wanted in three other states.”

My stomach dropped.

“For what?” I whispered.

Harrow’s eyes stayed on mine.

“Assault,” he said. “Kidnapping. Two cases where the women didn’t make it out.”

My throat tightened.

I felt like I couldn’t breathe.

“Why was he here?” I asked.

Detective Harrow exhaled slowly.

“He moves,” he said. “Changes names. Changes jobs. Keeps it simple.”

I thought of the café.

Rachel.

The warmth of that place.

The chalkboard menus.

The safe, normal life.

And Mark had walked right into it like he belonged.

“How did he choose me?” I whispered.

Detective Harrow didn’t answer right away.

Then he said something that still makes my stomach turn.

“He didn’t choose you randomly,” he said.

I stared at him.

Harrow continued.

“He chooses women who are in transition,” he said. “Women who just got out of long relationships. Women who are lonely. Women who don’t trust themselves anymore.”

My eyes burned.

“How do you know that?” I whispered.

Detective Harrow’s voice was quiet.

“Because that’s what the other victims had in common,” he said.

I felt my body go cold.

I thought of Mark’s questions.

Did he ever get physical?

Did you live together?

Why not?

What kind of damage am I dealing with?

He wasn’t being curious.

He was checking the locks on a door.

He was testing how much I’d tolerate.

He was making sure I was the right kind of vulnerable.

Rachel visited me later that day.

She looked like she hadn’t slept.

Her hair was pulled into a messy knot. Her eyes were red. She sat at the edge of my hospital bed like she didn’t know if she was allowed to be there.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered again.

I nodded.

“I know,” I said.

Rachel’s hands twisted together.

“He seemed so normal,” she said. “He was charming. He was funny. He was polite. He asked about you, Sarah. He asked me about you.”

My stomach clenched.

“What did you tell him?” I asked quietly.

Rachel froze.

Her eyes filled with tears.

“I told him you’d been through a lot,” she whispered. “I told him you deserved someone good. I told him… I told him you were strong.”

Her voice broke.

“I told him you were trying to heal.”

The words landed like a weight.

I stared at Rachel.

I didn’t blame her.

Not truly.

She didn’t do it maliciously.

She did it because she loved me.

But Mark didn’t hear those words the way Rachel meant them.

He heard them like coordinates.

Like a map.

Rachel reached for my hand.

“I didn’t know,” she whispered.

I squeezed her fingers.

“I know,” I said again.

But deep inside, something had changed.

Because I understood now that danger doesn’t always force its way into your life.

Sometimes you invite it in.

Not because you’re stupid.

Not because you’re reckless.

But because you are tired.

And you want to believe in something good again.

Mark Butler went to jail.

That’s the part people like.

The part where the story has a clean ending.

The part where the police arrive, the predator gets handcuffed, and the victim gets to go home.

But that isn’t the real ending.

The real ending is what happens after.

It’s the way you sit in your apartment with every light on.

It’s the way you check your locks twice.

It’s the way you hear footsteps in the hallway and your heart stops.

It’s the way you start wondering how many times you’ve walked past someone like Mark in a grocery store.

Smiling.

Normal.

Blending in.

The real ending is the realization Detective Harrow gave me without meaning to.

Mark didn’t need to know me.

He didn’t need to love me.

He didn’t even need to meet me.

He just needed to recognize the shape of my weakness.

And he did.

Because predators don’t always feel dangerous.

Sometimes they feel like exactly what you prayed for after being hurt.

And the most disturbing part is not that he attacked me.

It’s that for most of that night, I almost believed he was real.

When I think back on that date, I don’t remember the steak.

I don’t remember the pianist.

I don’t remember the candlelight.

I remember his questions.

I remember the way he watched me.

I remember the moment in the parking lot when my instincts screamed at me and I ignored them because I didn’t want to seem rude.

I didn’t want to be difficult.

I didn’t want to be the kind of woman who assumed the worst.

Now I understand something I wish I’d known sooner.

There are people in this world who learn how to wear kindness like a mask.

They learn how to speak softly.

They learn how to look safe.

And they go where women are trying to heal.

They go where women are trying to start over.

They go where women are trying to believe again.

Because it’s easier to take something from someone who is already exhausted.

And the most terrifying thing is not that Mark Butler existed.

It’s that men like him do.

Everywhere.

And sometimes they’re only one blind date away.",1,1771099894.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

He’s stressed about it because he’s trying to move up at work, and I was planning to go and support him even though those events make me feel like a prop. Two nights before, he sat me down and said we need to “be on the same page” and then he straight up handed me a script for how we met. Not the real story, a polished one. Coffee shop, mutual friends, cute details, like he was worried I’d mess up the timeline. I just stared at him because it felt like he wanted me to audition for the role of his partner.

The real story is we met at a recovery support group. We were both newly sober. It wasn’t romantic, it was real, and it matters to me. I don’t bring it up with strangers, but I’m not ashamed of it either. When I asked why he wanted to fake it, he said his coworkers are judgemental and he doesn’t want people thinking we’re “those people”. He said it could hurt his reputation, people might see him as unstable, and he can’t risk gossip with a promotion coming up. He kept insisting it’s not personal, but it felt personal. Like the real version of us is something he wants to hide.

I told him I’m not comfortable lying and I’m not memorizing a сценарий just so he looks respectable. I said I’m not an actor, I’m your partner. He got irritated and said everyone tells white lies at work and I’m making it too deep. He admitted he’s scared of judgement, and I get fear, but I couldn’t shake how gross it felt to erase the part of our story that basically saved both of us. I also know myself, if someone asks casually and I’m nervous, I’ll either tell the truth or mess up the lie and look worse.

So the day of the event, when he texted “ready?”, I panicked and told him I wasn’t coming. He called angry, saying I’m humiliating him and making him look bad, that everyone will ask where I am. I said I’m not trying to sabotage you, I just don’t want to sit in a room where I have to deny my own life to protect your image. He said I’m selfish and choosing some moral high ground over supporting him. I said I’m choosing dignity over playing a part. Now he’s barely speaking to me, and I’m stuck between guilt and this feeling that if I agree to this, next time I’ll be asked to edit more of myself.

AITA for not going and refusing to lie about how we met?

I’m sorry I misread our messages. I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable. And I’m especially sorry if I pushed you away. It wasn’t fair of me to ask you out for coffee, and it wasn’t fair of me to hope you might want to be more than an online friend. That expectation was mine alone, and I’m sorry for placing it on you.

I think, in hindsight, I fell in love with the idea of you rather than the reality of who you are. The truth is, we barely knew each other we only knew each other’s names. I don’t even know basic things about you. Are you gay? Are you even a woman? That should’ve been my reality check.

I’m also sorry I blocked you. But I need to be honest about that, too I did it because I had to. From my perspective, it started to feel like I was just another obligation in your life, something you checked off rather than chose. And that perception took a real toll on my mental health. I miss you every day, but I also know that keeping you blocked is helping me grow stronger and healthier.

I’m sorry it came to this. You’ll always mean something to me, even if that something was never truly real. I wanted it to be real because, in a way, you saved my life. Before we started talking, I was in a very dark place closer than I want to admit to ending things. You became a light during that time, a kind of anchor when everything else felt unbearable. You were my constant, my spark in the dark.

I didn’t mean to fall in love with you and yes, I know how that sounds. But you were everything I thought I wanted: a geek who spoke her mind, someone who vibed with me, laughed at my terrible jokes, and just got me. I fell for you before I ever knew what you looked like, and when I did see you, you felt impossibly beautiful not just physically, but because of your mind and attitude.

I know how unhealthy that sounds. I know how unbalanced it became.

When the internship came up and I got in so easily, I convinced myself it was fate. And I know that probably sounds unsettling, too. I guess the real reason I’m writing this today is because I wondered did I ever mean anything to you at all?

Maybe I did, at least a little. Or maybe the idea of us moving from a digital space into the real world scared you. And if that’s the case, then my feelings put pressure on something that mattered deeply to me a friendship that meant more than I knew how to protect at the time.

You saved my life, even if I never meant much to yours. You were my world, and I was never meant to be yours. Maybe in another life, with better timing and healthier boundaries, it could have worked. But here we are unbalanced, blocked, farther apart than ever… and yet somehow closer than I expected we’d be in memory and real life.",2,1771099728.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I built SCRAPS. A spinoff for people who love the one-a-day word game routine, but want a little more variety and strategy.

The Concept:

In SCRAPS, you start each day with a fixed tray of 30 letter tiles. You're then given a series of incomplete 4-letter words. You have to use the tiles to form a word before moving to the next. Everyone globally gets the same tiles and faces the same 4-letter patterns in the same order. Your goal is to complete as many words as possible with the given tiles.

The Strategy:

It’s a casual optimizer. You might find a great word for the first pattern, but if it uses up all your 'A's and 'E's early, you’ll struggle to finish the later rounds. The goal isn't just to find words, it's to manage your ""Scraps"" to see how far you can go.

Daily Seed: The word patterns and letter tiles reset and midnight local.

Stats: Compare your score against the global distribution chart.

No Pressure: It’s a 5-minute puzzle designed for your morning coffee.

This is my own experience.

A long time ago, I was diagnosed with depression. It happened 22 years ago. I had a good job and a family when my first severe crisis erupted. It was triggered by failing on a project at work, and everything went downhill very quickly. I lost my job and my family as well. Today I know that job was the only thing that kept me strong enough to keep going and prevented the depression from erupting; it had been with me for a long time, and I didn’t know it.

From then on, I had many other severe crises because there was no longer anything to hold on to in order to stay “okay,” and there were many more manageable crises that did not require me to be admitted to a hospital psychiatric ward. Like many people who live with depression, I took my medications and attended therapy without feeling any progress. There was also a very powerful message that came from the therapist I was working with at the time: “You will always be alone,” after an extremely painful breakup. My heart was broken, and those words destroyed me inside because I longed with all my heart for a deep connection with someone. Another completely unrelated person told me the same thing when I was falling into a crisis and unsuccessfully asked for help. So I had no choice but to accept it as an absolute truth: I will always be alone.

I decided to isolate myself and built a wall to completely cover me. The thickest and strongest wall that could exist. I put my heart inside a chest lined with velvet on the inside, with a lock and a key that only I would have. I placed the chest inside a steel box that could not be opened; I wrapped the box in concrete, wrapped the stone that formed with chains and padlocks. That still wasn’t enough, so I threw it into an extremely deep and dark ocean trench and covered the trench with large rocks and sand. No one would ever find my heart again. No one would touch it. No one would hurt it. If anyone ever even wanted to see my heart, they would have to make a superhuman effort to get to it.

I isolated myself and shut myself in far more than I already had been. The first 10 years after my diagnosis were very, very difficult, but one day, during a moment of introspection, I understood that depression would be with me for the rest of my life. That revelation gave me a very powerful weapon that prevented me from having another crisis. By making that idea conscious, I stopped fighting depression and saw it as a shadow that would always be near, waiting for any opportunity to try to pull me back into darkness and suffocate me.

I have not had another crisis since then. Twelve years have passed, and I learned to live with my depression. I stopped fearing it and learned to manage it. I didn’t feel alive, but I was stable.

During those 12 years, I managed to get and keep a job. A job that many people looked down on, something small in their eyes. For me, that job was very valuable. Thanks to that job, I had the fortune of meeting a couple of people from whom I learned to see life from other perspectives. They taught me to enjoy what deserves to be enjoyed in life: discovering hidden gems right in front of our eyes and appreciating them. Eating incredibly delicious food without spending too much, giving myself time to care for myself and be with myself in those moments, and starting a dialogue with myself even if it wasn’t pleasant.

You know that dialogue. It’s always there, and it doesn’t say nice things. We try to silence and ignore it, but it still hurts. It’s extremely difficult to silence, especially at night, but it also attacks us at any time during the day. It’s the voice that tells us we are garbage and that it’s better to be alone. It tells us all the things we should have done differently in the past and makes us imagine scenarios and things we didn’t do correctly that could have changed our present reality. It’s curious — it really wants to tell us something, but at the same time it doesn’t, and we don’t know what to do with it.

Not long ago, one of my two friends gave me a gift: a book. Specifically, *The Artist’s Way* by Julia Cameron. Although it didn’t tell me what to do with that inner dialogue, it opened the door to something truly priceless. The first task the author proposes is the morning pages. It consists of writing three pages every morning upon waking. It doesn’t matter what — you just write.

It was very hard for me to continue the task as requested… but here’s the important part… a door opened to begin vomiting EVERYTHING I carried inside. I wrote for days without stopping, every one of my memories since I was a small child. Every single one. It was very heavy, very difficult work, and I cried. I cried a lot — I still cry. Something that had been blocked finally opened. The valves were open to achieve something. I didn’t know what the destination was. I didn’t know what would happen.

I would wake up, make coffee, and sit down to write. I wrote all day, each memory with as much detail as possible. I cried, got angry, felt sadness while everything flowed through my hand and pen onto the paper. I only stopped writing to go to the bathroom and when my stomach told me I needed to eat. Basically, it was the only thing I did for several days.

Writing was only the beginning of a process that I am living today and that is bringing important changes to my life.

Imagine for a moment that today you are scientists working in a pathology lab, analyzing samples to find a disease. You place samples on a slide and analyze them, observe… and begin to notice things. Patterns appear. The causes of an illness begin to reveal themselves — literally. I don’t know what you would discover, but I discovered abuse, abandonment, humiliation, minimization — and something key was revealed: all my family memories are painful ones. I don’t have a single happy memory with my parents and siblings.

At that point, I didn’t know what to do with that, and I didn’t trust therapists. I believed in therapy, but I felt therapists didn’t help me. I am a very rational person and need to understand things. No therapist had explained anything about the process — emotions were stirred up, but there was no purpose or structure I could understand.

So I did what any rational person would do: I asked why I only had that kind of memory — memories that only bring pain. The answer allowed me to name the monster of my depression: Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. THAT is the real monster inside me.

What to do with it? Who to ask?

I found someone to ask, showed them my work, explained my memories — and from there, new work began. Recognizing that I was abused. Recognizing the desolation. And recognizing myself.

Because there is something very important in all of this: the essence of each of us — the purest, most innocent, sweetest, most sensitive part — is still inside us. When we remove the tons of garbage covering it, it comes to light. Then we can embrace it, and it will embrace us back with the purest form of love.

I know this may be hard to understand. It’s like what is said in *The Matrix*: no one can tell you what it is — you have to experience it yourself. But I promise you this: if you want to see it, live it, and feel it, you can — if you do the necessary work and walk the path, which is very hard and very difficult. Your own defense mechanisms will try to make you stop and remain in the comfort zone you know well, where you feel safe and comfortable.

There will be many obstacles, but I will tell you something: inside you is the strength to be stubborn enough not to let anyone stop you. You are worth it, and you deserve to live this change that I can tell you today is possible — and truly wonderful.

I swear that what I am living now is something completely new to me. It’s strange, uncertain — but beautiful.

I truly want you to know, down to the last atom of your being, that you are worth it and that you can achieve this. Give yourself the opportunity. Take the first step.

Stay strong. There is a champion and an incredibly beautiful light inside you.",1,1771099448.0,getting_over_it,0,1.0,False

In my free time, I like to cruise backroads on my vintage motorcycle. I also run a small IG page for **Christian aesthetic & lifestyle inspiration.** I enjoy Bible studies by the river, and attending church events like **worship nights, hangouts, and workshops.**

I was raised in a Chinese Baptist church - where my faith was nominal at best - until a divine miracle from God healed my eyesight and testified to His power beyond all doubt. Since then, I've gone through ups and downs in my faith journey, having recently volunteered for my new (evangelical) church's **prayer team.** As a personal calling, I am passionate about crafting **Biblical metaphors** from the ordinary routines of daily life.

These days, I be chillin' with a co-ed community of young adults (age 18-25) at church, as well as a men's weekly small group. I take my faith seriously - dying to myself, reading the Word, and praying daily. I have been successful at waiting until marriage, despite needing deliverance from a 10-year PMO addiction.

**Who am I looking for?** In Hebrew, the term *ezer kenegdo* means ""suitable helpmate,"" a co-heir in Christ who is ""equal yet complementary"" to the man. She should strive to become a Proverbs 31 woman, just as I strive to become an Ephesians 5 man. Whether your calling is parallel or complementary to mine, it doesn't bother me - as long as we're both running toward God - at the same pace, with the same heart. I believe in **dating to marry, pursuing with intention, and not playing games. I would eventually like to have 2 kids** in the future.

I'm fine with any **age 18 and up.** I've never had a girlfriend before, so I don't have much dating experience.

**Local only, no long-distance.**

**Disclaimer:** I'm 5'8"" so if that's a dealbreaker to you, let's not waste each other's time.

It's been a long wilderness, refinement, and growth season - but I finally feel like God has equipped me to test the waters of the 2026 Christian dating pool.

My parents to no surprise, always loved Alcohol yet always hated on marijuana, and marijuana users as Medical Doctors. 

My Dad was born 62, turning 64 later this year and my mom just turned 62, born in early 64. I'm well into in my early 30s now, and about the same age group they were when I was born (a freighting thought).  

My Mom when I was 18: (buys beer for me when you need to be 19). 

Also My Mom but when I was 19: (threatens to call the cops because she smelt a blunt). 

They drink 1-2 wine bottles (12% 750ml?) between them most nights, often more on holidays or when inviting guests. 

So of the four legal substances (that I always talk about in my post history) I grouped together alcohol and marijuana and also group together coffee and cigarettes. 

Two you drink (alcohol and caffeine) and the other two you smoke (marijuana and cigarettes) but two of them are mindaltering, alcohol and marijuana, while the other two are not mindaltering altering coffee and cigarettes.

Two months ago I went NC with my parents. My mom has a lifelong history of severe mental illness that I know suspect could be BPD. This sub has been very helpful, and I’m very grateful to all of you and immensely sorry for the reasons that brought you here.

My mom was physically and mentally abusive throughout most of my life (I’m now 36 yo) but the fog only started to lift for me three years ago when my first child was born. NC finally happened because over Christmas when my parents decided to not only treat me like rubbish, but also my husband. I couldn’t let them do that to the first person who taught me the true meaning of unconditional love.

I’ve been ruminating a lot and many memories have resurfaced, which I know is painful but necessary. Therapy has been very helpful and I will continue to do it for as long as necessary. In the midst of all of this I also got some puzzling memories that I just can’t understand and I was hoping some of you might be able to help.

My mom did the typical BPD thing of making my fertility struggles and pregnancy all about her, which was extremely stressful. But more than that, when she came over to stay with us after my son was born (my parents live in a different country) she was an absolute nightmare. 

She was so visible enraged and sad the whole time, she refused to leave the house with us, complained about the temperature non stop (my house was both too hot and too cold?!), the coffee we served her was too bitter, my baby cried too much (he was actually a chill baby and is still a chill toddler), constantly commented on my weight (made a whole show of complimenting me on looking amazing 1 month postpartum in front of everyone but also made fun of me for still wearing pregnancy jeans?!), the bathroom where she had her showers while staying over was apparently horrible, etc etc etc. But the most bizarre moment was related to a nightgown.

4/5 days into their stay we were chatting and I told her I had bought this nightgown to take to the hospital  (my baby was breach and I was scheduled in for a c-section, which means getting a catheter) to have my baby and I probably wouldn’t wear it a lot because I’m not a big fan of nightgowns. It was a crappy nightgown from H&M that I got on sale. She immediately asked me to give it to her. Now, my parents are middle class, my mom doesn’t need my hospital nightgown in any way, but I obviously gave it to her. I mean, knock yourself out lady.

On that day she was in a horrible mood and went to bed at 5.30 pm. I went to check in on her a couple of hours later and found her wrapped up in bed, wearing my nightgown (despite the fact that she had pjs that she had been using during her stay), awake and with the lights still on, staring at the wall and looking completely miserable.

Why was my mom so miserable when I had a baby? Why was she in bed awake, by herself, wearing my shitty nightgown, instead of spending time with her family? Why was my happiness an insult to her? Honestly, just why?",1,1771099222.0,raisedbyborderlines,1,1.0,False

Anywho, Earl Grey Creme brûlée, House Coffee, Goat cheese with Red Cherries. 

Wanted to try so many, but I was a bit overwhelmed, a lil self conscious, and sorta out of my element. 

The Earl Grey was everything I would have hoped it to be. The flavor was perfect. I cannot give an eloquent review as to mix-ins/toppings/ice cream ratio. Being gluten free, I can’t be so picky on those, I’m just lucky to have them. I liked it, actually I really loved it. It’s what I was wanting from the Earl Grey by Van Leeuwens, but that one was off to me. I still can’t figure out what exactly bothers me about that one but I always feel leaving like it’s not quite right. This one by Jen’s is perfect for me. 9.25/10

Goat cheese with cherries, of so nice!  I just kept thinking to myself, “It’s such a lovely ice cream”. The goat milk flavor is not overwhelming, but subtle. I love the chew of the cherries. I only wish there was more of it. Overall, really great. Not spectacular, but I would love to always have a pint of this in my freezer. Very easy and cleansing of the palette. 8.5/10

House Coffee. Lawdy have mercy. This one scares me, I don’t know how to feel or act or talk about it LMFAO!  Because there’s one king of coffee ice cream, yes yes, sir Häagen-Dazs Coffee. But Jenny’s coffeehouse split my brain. Had me wondering if I had been confused all this time. I was actually having a bit of a struggle in my mind not accepting that this could be better, but it’s not better, but it’s almost better, wait is it?!?! Had me wondering if it was almost the exact same ice cream, but it’s not. I literally cannot pinpoint how it’s different but it’s so dang close. I’m actually motivated to do a 10 round blind taste test, cause I really gotta sort this out. I’m so used to always picking coffee whenever I get ice cream and it’s never as good as the Holy Grail. And I always find myself comparing it back to Mr. Häagen-Dazs. Nothing ever comes close! But this one leads me to believe that I need to get to the bottom of this. Either way, it’s fantastic! If you think Häagen-Dazs coffee is the best, you are gonna feel that this one is right up there with it. Maybe just a hair below it because psychologically I cannot fathom that anything could be better than The One. But is it?

Mistake #1: No workspace identity. You now have a powerful agent runtime with no idea who it is, what it's supposed to do, or how to behave. That's like hiring a senior engineer and giving them no onboarding. Without AGENTS.md and SOUL.md, your agent is a blank slate every single session.

Mistake #2: Treating it as a tool instead of an operator. OpenClaw isn't a CLI tool; it's an agent runtime — a persistent, stateful system that can own workflows end-to-end. A tool waits for you to invoke it. An agent checks your email at 7am, drafts responses, and updates Your CRM — all before you've had coffee.

Mistake #3: Skipping memory architecture. Your agent wakes up fresh every session. The only continuity mechanism is files on disk. If you don't set up a memory system — daily logs, long-term memory, procedural knowledge — your agent is perpetually a day-one employee.

The Mindset Shift: Stop thinking: ""How do I get OpenClaw to do X?"" Start thinking: ""How do I build a system where my agent can figure out X on its own?""",1,1771098880.0,openclawsetup,0,1.0,False
1r4u6gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1r4u6gk/31_f4m_losangeles_valentines_day_post_from/,31 [F4M] #LosAngeles — Valentine’s Day post from someone ready for something real,"Hi. It’s Valentine’s Day, and I realized I haven’t put myself out there in a while (about two months). So here I am — not looking for grand gestures from strangers, just hoping to meet one good man who wants something genuine, calm, and lasting.

I’m a 31-year-old woman in Los Angeles seeking an emotionally safe, healthy, old-fashioned kind of romance. No hookups, no situationships, no chaos — just mutual effort, kindness, attraction, and stability.

**About me:**

* I’m a tutor at a school
* Beach lover — sunsets by the water are my therapy
* Huge coffee drinker (cafés over clubs, always)
* Old-fashioned romantic with a dry, deadpan, sarcastic sense of humor
* I stay off my phone and dislike social media
* I value presence, reliability, and intelligent conversation
* Creative — I enjoy drawing and writing
* Love synthwave, 80s/90s music & films, books, diners, dive bars, cafés, ice cream
* Fascinated by Japanese culture (udon = comfort food)
* Into motorcycles, coastal drives, and American muscle cars
* I have **five tattoos** and appreciate tattoos/artistic expression
* Favorite shows: *Cobra Kai, Gossip Girl, Weeds*
* Not religious
* Politically moderate / somewhere in the middle
* Non-smoker, drug-free (including vaping/weed — this is important)
* No kids, but I’d like a family someday
* Monogamy only

I want the kind of relationship where “good morning” texts aren’t performative — they’re sincere. Where showing up is normal, not rare.

**What I’m looking for:**

* Single man, **29–38**, in Los Angeles or within \~25–50 miles
* Emotionally mature, respectful, dependable
* Communicates like a responsible adult
* Not glued to his phone
* Doesn’t smoke or use drugs
* No kids
* Politically moderate preferred
* Can do witty banter *and* meaningful conversation
* Wants a serious, monogamous relationship
* Someone who will genuinely show up

If you ghost, breadcrumb, or keep things vague, we won’t be compatible.

**Logistics:**

* Your picture gets mine
* Please send a thoughtful message (no “hey”)
* If you live outside the U.S., distance and time zones will likely make things difficult

Ultimately, I’m looking for a romantic partner who also feels like my best friend — someone to share ordinary days, late-night talks, road trips, coffee runs, and quiet happiness with.

If you’re also spending Valentine’s Day hoping next year looks very different, say hello. 💛",0,1771098868.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

[**Chapter 18: Coffee Break**](https://archiveofourown.org/works/74557686/chapters/208422606)

**Rated:** Teen and Up

**Fic Summary:** We're starting this story where the show left us - Aziraphale is leaving for Heaven, Crowley stays on Earth, both of them have their hearts broken, and Metatron plans a Second Coming. There's angst, pain, regret, coping mechanisms, anger, but also hope and love. Oh, and there's a boy. And ducks. (A story with eventual happy ending)

**Chapter 18 Summary:** Aziraphale suddenly gets pulled out of his thoughts by Maggie. What was supposed to be a short coffee break, turns into a couple of hours long support meeting. And the girls have a plan.

**Excerpt:** 
> ""Um, no. My dear, I don't believe that Crowley will answer my call when he is in such a... truculent mood, I'm afraid."" Aziraphale gave her a guilty look, while also trying to avoid looking her in the eyes. He fidgeted with his pinky ring.

> Nina scoffed.

> ""That's an understatement Mr Fell, the bloke is clearly pissed. And I don't blame him,"" she pointed out, by literally pointing a finger towards the angel.

My bp varies greatly, sometimes it’s normalish (100s/60s) or very low (70s/50s). I’m on propranolol since I also have issues with random tachycardia episodes. I think it’s been helping me, but sometimes I feel a bit dizzy since my Bp runs on the lower end naturally. I know coffee is bad for me but it does raise my bp lol. Electrolytes have been helping raise my bp a bit.

1r4u4ne,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r4u4ne/teenagers_first_love_relationship_salvageable/,Teenagers’ first love / relationship salvageable?,"TL;DR: I (17F) messed up my relationship with my boyfriend (16M). He found old messages where I vented during a bad fight and said hurtful things, including calling our relationship an “arrangement” and mentioning expensive gifts he’d given me. There was also a joke from a friend that made it look like I might’ve cheated, even though I didn’t. When he confronted me, I panicked, explained things badly, refused to go through all the messages, and ran, making everything look worse. Now he thinks I used him and maybe cheated. I’ve tried returning his gifts and spent the whole night trying to see him without actually talking to him. He says we have basically a 0% chance of getting back together, but I still love him deeply and want a chance to fix things before he flies home in 30 hours.

—————————

Our breakup was completely my fault. I am the girlfriend in the relationship (17F) and my ex-boyfriend is 16. We have been best friends for a little over a year now and were meant to hit our 2 month anniversary (for dating) on Valentine’s day. He flew from a different state to visit me over the Valentine’s weekend and landed early in the morning on the 12th.

\*\*The incident:\*\*

Around 9 PM the evening before Valentine’s day, as we were getting ready to head out of the hotel (yes, it was booked by a friend who’s 18+), he was messaging my best friend some random funny stuff while I was still getting ready. I fully trust him and we each have each others’ phone passcodes. This is not due to any trust issues or any past incidents, it’s just convenient when we need to change the song playing on someone’s phone, call Uber, call eachothers’ phones when they’re lost, etc. He searched “money” in my Instagram chat with my best friend and read a portion of our most recent conversation containing that key word. This conversation was from a while ago during an awful period when we were fighting, however definitely from WHILE we were dating and I said some awful things about my boyfriend. I was venting to my best friend and she asked me if I would date him if he wasn’t rich. I didn’t respond to her however I referred to our relationship as an “arrangement” and listed out 2 of the most expensive gifts he’d given me as an example: a MacBook pro and 4.5k necklace. Another issue from that conversation he viewed that I didn’t realise until mid-day the day after was the mention of a boy’s name. My best friend made a random joke, something along the lines of “Imagine if he (my now ex-boyfriend) was Jack Smith (random name)”. This guy is rather heavy and known as a bit of a pervert from a different school and her comment was 200% a joke, however he had Jack Smith (fake) confused with John Paul (fake name again) because their names start with the same letters in real life. John Paul, on the other hand, has messaged me before on social media and approached me at the library + mall before to meet outside of school. I have no association with him and he has pretty awful qualities (failing school, delinquent behaviour) so there’s no reason for jealousy however my (now) ex-boyfriend has mentioned him several times over our relationship.

He confronted me about the conversation immediately and I attempted to explain myself. I didn’t really remember the context of this convo with my best friend and I did not do a good job communicating at all. He gave me an ultimatum to go through the rest of the messages mentioning the key word “money” or else I needed to leave. We went back and forth a couple times and I insisted that we go through the messages mentioning his name + nicknames first because we’ve never had positive conversations about money and I wanted him to view all the positive things I say about him first. He agreed, and one of the first couple messages mentioning his name was me conversing with a friend to cover for me when I was going out to dinner with another one of my best friends during exam week. The reason for this is because my boyfriend does not approve of this friend and we have discussed her before in the past. She has a history of micro-cheating on her short-term boyfriends (e.g. talking to exes, excessively snapping other boys as well as her list of snapchat friends being exclusively boys) however she has been one of my closest long-term friends over the years and I have chosen to distance myself and turn a blind eye to those aspects of her life. This was also a mistake on my part, I have no idea why I chose the easy way out of having to mildly explain to my boyfriend rather just been upfront and honest (it’s dinner for goodness sake, not the club!?). This was a stupid action and I really wasn’t thinking straight because of stress and frustration during exam week. This friend and the previous friend mentioned are NOT on good terms due to comments made by the most recently mentioned friend about the first friend’s facial features. When I mentioned covering for me to my friend, I didn’t mention WHO I was having dinner with because I knew it might raise some questions?? My message was exactly: “Having dinner with a friend”. My friend had the most amazing idea to respond with “don’t cheat on (boyfriend’s name)”. Her message didn’t mean anything and I didn’t even acknowledge it, however my boyfriend saw this text convo when we were going through my phone together. Now he ALSO thinks I cheated on him, which, if I was in his position, I’d consider absolutely unforgivable. HOWEVER, this of course didn’t happen. My boyfriend was my first everything, i.e. relationship, kiss, etc. I have some personal opinions about purity culture / sex, however I was willing to lose my virginity to him because I truly love him. We’ve tried a couple times but haven’t been successful.

After he saw the “cheating” allegations, he told me he was fed up and we had to return to the search of the messages mentioning “money” or I needed to leave. I tried explaining to him but honestly was just digging a deeper hole for myself, so I chose to leave. This was a horrible mistake and I wish I hadn’t packed my stuff and ran. The only right thing I did was return the 2 gifts mentioned before. He said he’d never thought I was a gold digger but now he wasn’t sure. He told me to keep the computer and sell the necklace. I told him of course I’d give them back and he refused, saying he didn’t care about the money. It has never occurred to me that our relationship was solely transactional + built on money/presents he’s given me so of course I’d return those gifts to him. He told me that if I left before going through our messages we were over, yet I still ran away without thinking. I am so so stupid and deeply regretful of just taking the easy way out and I feel like this was the biggest mistake I’ve ever made in my life. That night I planned to Uber home but instead detoured to my best friend’s house. The same best friend I was saying awful things about my boyfriend to during our fights and she was fuelling the fire. That was so stupid and that night I couldn’t bring myself to answer my boyfriend’s messages and calls or my Mum’s calls to come home.

\*\*Aftermath:\*\*

Since then, I haven’t really spoken to him over messages and I’ve completely dodged his calls. Mid-day, after the break-up, my Mum spoke to him over the phone and he told her we were over and that I hurt him so much.

This evening (the day after the break up) I went all the way to the city, arriving at around 9 PM, grabbed a coffee and head to a famous landmark where we first went when we first started dating. My mum called me asking where I was, and I told her where I was and she asked whether she should let him know. She feigned asking him where I was, and he messaged and called me telling me my mum messaged him and that she’s worried. I didn’t pick up his call. I turned on my snapchat location and after a couple hours posted a story of the landmark because I wanted him to come. I feel so unbelievably dumb. I was there for hours and spoke to several friends and chatted with 2 random 20 or so years old women who all told me to call him to tell him how sorry I was rather than telling other people my mistakes and avoiding him. Around 1:30 AM my friend and her boyfriend came to see me and we left the landmark and went into the city to his hotel. I couldn’t bring myself to go up to his room and knock, so we just sat on a bench in front of the hotel, and around an hour later my friend had to leave. She tried dragging me away but I stayed and she eventually had to leave with her boyfriend. I went to this gaming cafe nearby that me and my boyfriend had been to before and he’d asked to go to a couple times prior. I looked through every setup and person but obviously he wasn’t there, so I stayed for an hour, just replying to his younger sister’s message and absolutely spiralling, then I left and wandered around the city + the front of his hotel some more. I just arrived home, a little before 6:30 AM, and I feel so lost and sad.

\*\*Some context:\*\*

He has some mental health struggles due to some traumatic incidents however I’ve always ensured to be understanding and supportive. He has an amazing, loving family (I’ve met his family and vice versa) and is a very successful crypto trader. This year he moved to online school to focus more on work.

\*\*What the hell do I do:\*\*

I would honestly give anything to even try to fix our relationship. I love him so much and I wish I could’ve seen this earlier before I felt the need to vent bitterly about him to my friends. I regret doing that so much and he definitely felt so upset reading those messages too. I regret not going through the rest of the messages with him either, because now it’s too late and he’s obviously assuming the worst. I went through the messages myself on the ride home and I let my mum scroll through all of them too and they really weren’t that awful.

He has messaged and tried calling me, however he affirmed this morning that we pretty much have a 0% chance of getting back together. He said he still really likes me and honestly couldn’t believe I just used him for money, and I know that’s totally untrue but I haven’t been able to express that to him because I keep avoiding his calls.

He hasn’t unadded/blocked me on any social media yet, and it’s truly my last chance before his flight in 30 hours.

I understand this is my first boyfriend however I really love him and I don’t want to spend the rest of my life wondering “what if…?”. I’ve seen people’s posts about their first loves and how you never really get over them. I want to fix things so bad otherwise die trying I guess lol. I can’t stand the thought that I’ll have to spend the rest of my life missing him.",1,1771098748.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

1r4u3vk,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1r4u3vk/last_night_at_mels_diner/,Last Night at Mel's Diner,"The scent of frying onions and stale coffee usually filled Mel's Diner, a comforting, greasy aroma that promised familiar sustenance. Tonight, it was a thin, frail mask over the metallic stink of fear. 



Mel, a man whose apron had seen more stains than a battlefield, gripped a metal baseball bat like it was his last hope, and perhaps it was. His usual easygoing demeanor was replaced by a grim resolve. As the owner, he’s responsible for everyone here. It’s his job to keep them safe, from the employees to the regulars. They are all trapped here, all of their lives hanging in a fragile balance.



""Alright, listen up!"" Mel barked, his voice cracking slightly. ""T We saw five down Elm Street. Five! This isn't no flu, folks."" No, the flu doesn’t lead to rabid behavior! Mel didn’t tell anyone, but he saw one of those things tearing into poor Pam. She had almost got to the door when one grabbed her arm. 



It pulled her down and….tore into her. It bit her arm, tearing chunks off. Pam ran, screaming, and he later saw her with the crowd in front of the diner. One of them, howling and moaning for the flesh of those inside. 



Behind him, the small crew of Mel's Diner huddled. There was Brenda, the no-nonsense waitress with a surprisingly steady hand on a cleaver. Junior, the skinny dishwasher, nervously clutched a mop handle. And then there was Kevin, the line cook, whose greasy hair and perpetual scowl usually meant he was annoyed by a misplaced spatula, not the apocalypse. Tonight, his scowl was a permanent fixture, his eyes darting to the reinforced windows.



They'd barricaded the doors with overturned booths, stacked chairs, and anything else heavy they could find. The windows, usually adorned with plastic holiday decorations, were now crisscrossed with duct tape and covered with plywood scavenged from the back alley. Mostly shipping pallets that had been broken down. 



It has to hold, but it does not feel secure. There are too many outside for them to risk running; they have no choice but to sit and wait for rescue. This is America—the largest military in the world. Surely the army or the Marines will come soon. 



The only light came from the flickering emergency lanterns, casting long, dancing shadows that made every creak and groan of the old building sound like a shuffling menace.



""Mel, we need to think about getting out,"" Kevin said, wiping his hands on a blood-stained rag. He'd been making sure the kitchen knives were sharp, a grim task. ""This ain't gonna hold. They just keep coming."" As if emphasize his words, something hits the glass as a mournful howl cuts through the air.



""And go where, Kevin?"" Brenda retorted, her eyes hard. ""To the mall? The gas station? It's all the same out there. Here, at least we got food, water... and a fighting chance.""



A loud THUD against the back door made them all jump. Junior yelped, dropping his mop. ""They're here!""



Mel raised his bat, his knuckles white. ""Stay calm. We hold the line. Remember, aim for the head. They're slow, but they're strong.""



The thudding continued, growing louder, more insistent. The wood of the door splintered, a jagged crack appearing. A grotesque moan, guttural and hungry, seeped through the gap, signaling imminent danger.



""Get ready!"" Brenda hissed, her cleaver glinting.



Kevin, however, was already moving. He knew this was a losing battle, but his resolve kept him going. He'd seen the numbers on the news before the power went out. He'd watched the police station get overrun. A diner, even Mel's, stood no chance. While the others braced for impact, he quietly slipped into the walk-in freezer. It was a tight squeeze, cold and smelling of defrosting meat. He listened, his heart hammering against his ribs, but he refused to give in to despair.



The sounds from the diner grew frantic. Shouts, the sickening wet thud of Mel's bat connecting, Brenda's fierce cries, and then... a horrifying gurgling scream that was unmistakably Junior's. Kevin squeezed his eyes shut. He heard the tearing, the gnawing. It was over.



He waited. Minutes stretched into an eternity. The sounds outside the freezer door eventually died down, replaced by sluggish shuffles and guttural grunts. The air grew colder, each breath a painful, icy gasp.



Finally, with a tremor running through his entire body, Kevin pushed the heavy freezer door open just enough to peek out. The diner was a nightmare. Tables were overturned, blood painted the walls and floor in grisly strokes. Two shambling figures, one unmistakably Mel, another a former patron, lumbered slowly, their jaws working. He couldn't see Brenda or Junior. He didn't want to.



Kevin knew his window was small. He slid out, keeping low, his eyes scanning for an exit. The back door, where the initial assault had occurred, was completely destroyed, a gaping maw to the infected night. He had to go through the front, moving carefully to avoid detection.



One of the shamblers let out a wet growl, its head snapping in his direction. Kevin froze, barely breathing. It shuffled a step closer, its vacant eyes fixed on him.



This was it.



With a burst of adrenaline, Kevin sprinted. He dodged the slow-moving zombie, weaving between overturned chairs and sticky pools of blood. He burst through the remains of the front door, splintering plywood flying, and didn't look back. The cold night air hit him like a shock, but it was a welcome sensation compared to the horror he'd left behind.



He ran, the image of Mel's vacant stare burned into his mind, the screams of his friends echoing in his ears. The diner, once a place of comfort, was now just another casualty in a world gone mad. Kevin, the line cook who'd just wanted to flip burgers, was now a solitary survivor, with nothing but the clothes on his back, a very sharp knife, and the grim knowledge that he was truly alone. He ran, hoping the forest ahead would offer more than just another ending.

1r4u1qi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFIB/comments/1r4u1qi/newly_diagnosed_afib/,Newly Diagnosed AFib,"Been lurking through this subreddit reading everyone's various stories which have been helpful in terms of hopeful and successful treatments and cautionary tales. I thank everyone for their written experiences and those who have directly discussed my concerns.

I was diagnosed with AFib/flutter on 2/5/26, after getting an echocardiogram, stress test, and heart monitor for 2 weeks. The heart monitor is what caught my afib symptoms, which were classified as rare and I have met with an EP as of 4 days ago. I started experiencing symptoms shortly after Christmas which scared the hell out of me and made me quite anxious as I could feel my heart skipping beats in my throat and occasionally be flip-flopping in my chest. Despite an urgent care and ER visit, none of my episodes were caught until the monitor. The frequency that these symptoms have happened have gone down since then but have not stopped. They seem to happen randomly but the only pattern I can notice is they happen when I get up from laying in bed in the middle of the night to pee or just some time in the evening, but they can happen anytime  with no seemingly real trigger. I have started taking metoprolol succ er 25 mg as of 2/5/26, daily, since my blood pressure started being high for the first time in my life as soon as I started experiencing these symptoms. 

  
I have been a consistent marijuana smoker for at least a decade now, I'm a 34 white male weighing 185 lbs (5'9, down 20 lbs since the start of December). When all this happened I started a strict diet of low sodium, cholesterol, fat, and saturated fat and have been maintaining this diet with a cheat meal or cheat day once a week. I stopped drinking coffee, alcohol, marijuana, and chocolate the day after Christmas. Despite all this the symptoms continue to happen even on the metaprolol. My EP on Tuesday was great and said he wants to wait and said it would be okay to drink, have THC, work out, and have coffee, as he didn't see these as triggers and orderd a blood test to check for hyperthyroidism. I started drinking coffee the day after (2 cups a day) and haven't noticed that affecting anything but last night I had a vodka cocktail and then started having an afib episode for 30 minutes (high and inconsistent heart rate, feeling the flipflopping in my chest) and then skipped beats for hours afterward too, not sure if there is any correlation to that or not but I'm now scared to drink anymore. Not even sure I will try a TCH edible now for fear of another afib episode taking place (I'm also sending all these ekgs through the Kardia app to my EP like he asked)

I say all this to ask what others experiences are with substance like these, beta blockers, and afib. I'm also curious if anyone has recovered from this due to my symptoms starting a few weeks after having a severe case of the flu (it was pretty rough). My EP said we could likely do an ablation or nothing, my choice, and seemed to imply that this could potentially resolve if this was all flu related but I'm wondering if anyone else has had experience with flu/covid and afib recovering after several months.

  
I unfortunately have bad anxiety that I'm in therapy for (especially around my health) so this has been a lot of ups and downs for me these last 6-7 weeks. I'm honestly scared to go on my bike rides now for fear of what might happen, scared to experiment with alcohol as I'm not quite sure if this one cocktail caused the afib episode or I'm just assuming correlation implies causation, which in turn makes me cautious to try THC. I don't think I would be too bent out of shape if I couldn't drink or smoke ever again to be honest, but I'm getting married in 3 months and have a bachelor party in 2 months and the thought of just not being able to have a ""little bit of fun"" kind of pisses me off and makes me pretty sad.

  
Thanks to everyone who takes the time to read and respond, its greatly appreciated. Apologies for the disjointed thought essay lol.",2,1771098550.0,AFIB,1,1.0,False

The walk to Mini-Mart was surreal. Miles trudged along the sidewalk, muttering to himself and occasionally glancing over his shoulder. To any passerby, he looked like a sleep-deprived college kid having an animated conversation with thin air.

“So, the quest just says haunt people?” Miles asked, keeping his voice low as we passed an elderly couple walking their corgi. The dog’s ears perked up as I drifted by, its head tracking my invisible form. “That’s pretty vague.”

“I’m guessing I just need to do some stereotypical ghost shit.”

I experimented with height, finding I could hover anywhere from ground level to about fifteen feet up. The corgi started barking frantically in my direction, straining against its leash.

“That dog can definitely see you,” Miles muttered, quickening his pace.

“Animals are more sensitive to the paranormal,” I said, drifting closer to the dog. “At least that’s what all those ghost hunting shows claimed.”

The corgi’s barking reached a fever pitch as I hovered directly above it. The elderly woman tugged at the leash, cooing, “What’s wrong, Pumpkin? There’s nothing there, silly dog.”

**\[MINOR PARANORMAL DISTURBANCE GENERATED: 5 XP\]**

“Huh, even freaking out animals gives me XP,” I noted as we continued down the street. “Not much, though.”

The Mini-Mart’s familiar neon sign flickered in the distance, casting a sickly blue glow across the empty parking lot. Only one car was parked outside. I could see Darren the clerk scrolling on his phone behind the counter.

“Perfect,” I said, a spectral grin spreading across my face. “Target acquired.”

“So what’s the plan?” Miles asked, stopping at the edge of the lot. “You just go in there and start throwing stuff around?”

“You go in first and distract Darren. I’ll see what I can do.”

Miles nodded, pushing through the door with exaggerated confidence. The bell jingled, and Darren looked up from his phone, his expression souring immediately.

“We’re closing in fifteen,” he grunted, though the store hours clearly showed they were open for another hour.

“Just grabbing some energy drinks,” Miles replied, heading toward the back of the store.

I slipped in behind him, scanning the space for haunting opportunities. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting harsh shadows across the grimy linoleum. A radio played softly from behind the counter, some generic pop station interrupted by occasional bursts of static.

“Perfect.”

I concentrated on the radio first, extending my spectral influence toward it. The music warped, distorted voices stretching into unintelligible groans. Darren frowned, tapping the radio with his knuckle.

“What the hell?” he muttered, adjusting the dial. The station cleared momentarily, then descended back into chaos as I pushed harder.

Darren unplugged the radio, but the noise continued, my ghostly interference bypassing the need for electricity. His eyes widened.

**\[FEAR GENERATED: 5/100\]**

I drifted over to the snack aisle, focusing on my new Poltergeist Grip ability. A bag of chips trembled slightly on the rack. I concentrated harder, watching my MP drain as the bag inched forward.

**\[MP: 80/100\]**

With a final push, the bag tumbled off the shelf, landing with a loud crinkle. Darren’s head snapped up.

“Hey! You break it, you buy it!” he called out, peering down the empty aisle.

Miles shot me a look from behind the cooler doors. I floated over to the slushy machine next, focusing my energy on the lever. The bright blue raspberry slushy started dispensing into thin air, pooling on the floor.

“What the,” Darren stood up, his phone forgotten. “Is that thing malfunctioning again?”

I moved to the magazine rack, concentrating on flipping pages. Several gossip magazines began frantically turning their pages, like they were caught in a windstorm.

Miles pretended to browse energy drinks, watching the clerk’s growing panic with barely concealed amusement.

“Dude,” he whispered. “This is working.”

I drifted over to the counter, hovering directly in front of Darren. The fluorescent lights above flickered as I passed under them. The clerk’s eyes widened, darting between the self-dispensing slushy, the flipping magazines, and the flickering lights.

**\[FEAR GENERATED: 15/100\]**

“Is anyone else seeing this?” Darren called out, his voice cracking. Miles was the only customer in the store.

“Seeing what?” Miles asked innocently, bringing a Red Bull to the counter.

I concentrated on the cash register, pushing every last bit of my energy into one big spectral shove. The drawer shot open with a ding, receipts flying into the air.

“HOLY SHIT!” Darren stumbled backward, knocking over a display of lighters.

**\[FEAR GENERATED: 25/100\]**

His eyes darted wildly around the store, searching for an explanation that wasn’t supernatural.

I concentrated on the notepad next to the register, managing to scribble a wobbly “BOO” across the top page before my energy reserves dipped dangerously low.

Darren’s face went from confused to terrified as he watched the pen move by itself.

**\[FEAR GENERATED: 70/100\]**

I focused on my manifestation skill making myself partially visible, just a shadowy outline hovering behind the counter. Darren looked up from his phone and screamed, dropping it with a clatter.

**\[FEAR GENERATED: 100/100\]**

**\[XP GAINED: 50/200\]**

“I’m out,” he announced to no one in particular, grabbing his phone and keys. “I don’t get paid enough for this paranormal bullshit.”

He bolted for the door, nearly bowling over Miles in the process. The bell jingled violently as Darren fled into the parking lot, his car screeching out moments later.

“Holy shit, that worked!” Miles exclaimed, looking around the empty store.

“Yes!” I shouted, causing all the lights in the store to surge before dimming. My MP was nearly depleted, but it was worth it.

“That,” Miles said, breaking into laughter, “was the greatest thing I’ve ever seen. Did you see his face? Classic.”

“Where next?” Miles said, helping himself to the abandoned Red Bull.

I checked my interface, watching my MP slowly regenerate. “Need to recharge first. That took more energy than I expected.”

“We should probably get out of here,” Miles said, snagging a few more energy drinks and a bag of chips. He left a twenty on the counter. “Darren might call someone, and I don’t feel like explaining why I’m hanging out in an abandoned convenience store talking to myself.”

“Let’s hit up the laundromat next. That place has always given me creepy vibes. Might as well return the favor.”

I drifted toward the exit, feeling the strange tether in my chest that marked the boundary of my haunt radius.

“Sounds like a plan,” I said, following Miles through the door.

Outside, the night air was crisp with an early autumn chill, not that I could feel it anymore. Miles zipped up his hoodie and glanced at his phone.

“Shit, it’s almost midnight.”

Miles popped open one of the energy drinks he’d grabbed. “You know, this is kind of messed up, but I’m actually having fun. Is that wrong?”

I drifted alongside him, occasionally passing through a street sign just because I could. “Dude, I’m literally getting XP for terrorizing people. If anyone’s morally compromised here, it’s me.”

As we walked, I noticed other weird things about being dead that I hadn’t picked up on before. Streetlights dimmed slightly as I passed under them. A stray cat hissed and darted across the street when I floated too close. And there was something else a faint, barely perceptible humming coming from certain buildings, like they were giving off some kind of energy signature I couldn’t see but somehow felt.

“Miles,” I said, stopping in front of an old Victorian house that was practically vibrating with this strange resonance. “Do you see anything weird about that house?”

Miles squinted at it. “The one with the peeling paint and creepy garden gnomes? I mean, it’s kind of a dump, but,”

“No, I mean, it feels different. Like it’s buzzing or something.”

He gave me a skeptical look. “You getting ghost vision now?”

“Maybe? I don’t know.” I drifted closer to the house, feeling the strange vibration intensify. “It’s like I can sense something about it that I couldn’t before.”

“Can ghosts detect haunted houses?” Miles suggested, keeping his distance from the property. “Like how dogs can smell each other’s butts and know stuff? Maybe there’s another ghost in there.”

“Maybe,” I said, floating a bit closer to the house. The vibration grew stronger, almost like a bass note I could feel in my non-existent bones.

**\[NEW SKILL DISCOVERED: SPECTRAL SENSE - Detect supernatural energies and entities. Passive ability, no MP cost.\]**

“Whoa,” I said, reading the notification. “I just unlocked a new skill. Spectral Sense. Apparently, I can detect other supernatural stuff now.”

“We are not investigating the murder house,” Miles declared firmly. “We stick to the plan. Laundromat, then maybe the 24-hour diner if you’re up for it.”

“Fine,” I conceded, reluctantly drifting away from the house.

The laundromat was a depressing little establishment wedged between a pawnshop and a thrift store. At this hour, only one person was inside a tired-looking college student with headphones, sitting on a plastic chair while her clothes tumbled in a dryer.

“Perfect,” I said, my spectral form practically vibrating with anticipation.

Miles held up a hand. “Wait, look at her. She’s just trying to do laundry at midnight because it’s probably the only time she has. Maybe we should pick a different target?”

I paused, observing the girl more closely. Dark circles under her eyes, textbooks spread across her lap, a half-empty cup of vending machine coffee beside her. She did look pretty miserable already.

“You’re right,” I admitted, surprising myself. “Let’s find someone who deserves a good haunting.”

Miles’s expression softened. “Thanks, man. Glad to see death hasn’t completely corrupted your moral compass.”

“Yet,” I added with a spectral grin. “The night is young.”

We were about to leave when the laundromat’s front door chimed. A middle-aged man in an ill-fitting suit strode in, immediately walking to the girl and looming over her.

“Rent’s due tomorrow,” he barked, causing her to jump and pull off her headphones. “Don’t forget the late fee from last month.”

“I told you, I get paid on Friday,” she replied, shrinking into her chair. “Can’t it wait three more days?”

“Rules are rules,” he sneered, tapping his watch. “Pay tomorrow or find somewhere else to live.”

I glanced at Miles, who was glaring daggers at the man. “That our guy?”

“That’s definitely our guy,” Miles confirmed, a mischievous smile spreading across his face.

**The Grocery Store on ElmThe** 

 

The avocados were wrong. Too firm, too green, the kind that wouldn't ripen for days, and Nadia was squeezing each one with the focus of a surgeon when she heard it — a laugh she hadn't heard in six years but had never, not once, forgotten.She didn't look up right away.   
She stood there holding an unripe avocado and let the sound move through her the way a train moves through a tunnel, filling every inch of space.Then she looked.Marcus was standing near the tomatoes with a little girl on his hip. She was maybe three, with his same wide-set eyes and a headband shaped like a bow. He was telling her something, and the girl was laughing too, and Nadia understood with terrible clarity that the world had continued after her. That it had given him things.He turned.The recognition was not instant. It came in stages — a flicker, a frown, and then a stillness that settled over his face like snow falling on a lake. 



He shifted the girl to his other hip.""Nadia.""""Hey, Marcus.""Six years. Two syllables each. She wanted to say something else, but every sentence she composed in her head sounded either too casual or too devastating, so she just stood there holding the avocado like it was the last solid thing in the world.He walked over. The girl buried her face in his neck, suddenly shy.""This is Yara,"" he said.

""She's beautiful.""She meant it. That was the worst part — she meant it completely. The child had his same dark lashes, the ones Nadia used to trace with her fingertip on Sunday mornings when neither of them wanted to get up.

""You look good,"" he said, and the kindness in his voice was almost unbearable because it was the kindness of someone who had healed. She recognized it. She had thought she'd healed too, right up until thirty seconds ago.""I'm good,"" she said. ""I'm — yeah. I moved back in September. I'm at the university now. Research position.""""That's great. That's really great."" He nodded the way people nod when they want to mean it. ""You always wanted that.""\*You always wanted that.\*

As if he still carried around a map of her old dreams. As if he'd kept them filed somewhere, not out of love anymore, but out of the careful respect you give to something that once burned down your house.

The little girl — Yara — lifted her head and stared at Nadia with the honest, appraising look that only children can get away with.""I like your earrings,"" she said.Nadia touched her ear. Small gold hoops. She'd bought them in Lisbon the year after the breakup, during the trip she took to prove to herself she could be alone in a beautiful place without calling him.""Thank you, sweetheart.""Marcus smiled — not the old smile, the reckless one that used to make her do stupid, wonderful things, but a quieter version. A dad smile. A smile that had been domesticated.""Well,"" he said.""Well.

""There was a pause that contained an entire archaeological dig — layers of arguments about dishes, slow dancing in the kitchen, the last conversation where she'd said *I think we want different lives* and he'd said *I think you're right* and they had both been correct and it had not mattered at all.""It was really good to see you,"" he said.""You too, Marcus.""

He walked away. Yara waved over his shoulder, a tiny, opening-and-closing fist, and Nadia waved back and watched them disappear around the end of the aisle.She stood there for a long time.Then she put the avocado in her basket, even though it wasn't ready yet. She'd wait for it. She was good at waiting for things to soften. She'd had years of practice.

The coffee shop door chimed, and Maya looked up from her laptop out of habit. That's when she saw him.

Daniel stood at the counter, older now, his hair shorter than she remembered. He was ordering something complicated—she could tell by the way the barista nodded patiently, punching buttons on the register. He'd always been particular about his coffee. Two pumps of vanilla, never three.

She had exactly three seconds to decide: duck behind her screen and pray he wouldn't notice her, or catch his eye and get it over with. Her body made the choice before her mind could, tensing visibly, and that small movement drew his gaze across the room.

Recognition flickered across his face. Then something else—surprise, maybe, or the same jolt of time collapsing that she felt in her chest.

He paid for his drink and walked over. Not rushed, not hesitant. The same easy stride she used to watch from her bedroom window when he'd arrive at her door.

""Maya.""

""Hi, Daniel.""

They stood there, and she became acutely aware of how many years had passed. Five? Six? Long enough that the sharp edges had worn smooth, but not so long that she'd forgotten the weight of his hand in hers or the particular way he laughed at his own jokes before the punchline.

""You look good,"" he said, and it sounded genuine. Not like a line.

""You too."" She gestured at the empty chair across from her, a peace offering. ""Do you have a minute?""

He glanced at his watch—new, she noticed, nicer than what he used to wear—then sat down, cradling his coffee between both palms. That hadn't changed.

""So,"" they said simultaneously, then laughed, and for a moment it was like no time had passed at all.

 

**sonnet 3.7**

The café window framed her like a photograph from another life. Emma froze mid-step on the rain-slicked sidewalk, her umbrella tilting 

dangerously as recognition washed over her.Daniel looked exactly the same and entirely different. 

 

The sharp angles of his face had softened, and silver threaded his temples where there had once been only darkness. He was laughing at something on his laptop screen, the same laugh that had once been the soundtrack to her happiest days.Five years dissolved like sugar in hot coffee. Five years since the night they'd decided their paths diverged too sharply to walk together, both too stubborn to bend.She should walk away. She had meetings, deadlines, a carefully constructed life with no room for ghosts. 

 

Instead, she folded her umbrella and pushed open the door, heart hammering against her ribs.His eyes found hers across the room, widening slightly. Time suspended between them, crowded with unspoken words. 

 

Then he smiled – not the brilliant grin she remembered, but something gentler, lined with the wisdom of passing years.""Emma,"" he said, her name both familiar and foreign on his lips. ""Would you like to sit down?""",1,1771098412.0,ClaudeAI,2,1.0,False

I feel alone sometimes…,"Two of my best friends are at my hometown. Me and my other best friend are at different state living in a double hostel room attending the same college. But we are in different departments, at first, me, her and two other girls from her depts (also from our state) mostly hang out together but i always felt left out, i was never even invited to lunch, I'll have to call them 2-3 times to know where they were at. I kept on doing that for like 2 months after joining college because i am the only girl from our state in the maths department, no one in my class speaks my language while there are like 5-8 girls from same state grouped together since first day and i do not dare to join in. I was mostly alone even though i talked to my classmates, we got along and talked about stuff but i didn't click with anyone to actually be friends who stick together. And they already had  friends. 

When i finally got annoyed at how my friends treated me, i just stopped following them around and only then, they started inviting me to stuff… for like 2 times. I became friends with 2 of the girls from my dept who took the same minor as me. They also have one other friend and they are all from the same state. Even when i hangout with the three of them, I still feel left out because they speak in their language most of the time and sometimes in English for me to understand, i just feel like I'm bothering them and I'm where i should not be.

And i now mostly hangout with one of them because the other two are not back yet. We are both the quiet type and it's so hard being friends with someone when you both need to communicate in your second language that you are not that fluent in, plus if you are both introverts. Even during long 45 mins break, we would get coffee, just sit and stare at our phones, then talk a bit. We know each other for like 4-5 months now but we talk like we know each other for a week.

1r4txe1,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1r4txe1/6_reasons_private_equity_annoys_me_a_short_rant/,6 reasons Private Equity annoys me: A short rant.,"Do you remember *The Number 23*? It’s a 2007 psychological thriller, starring Jim Carrey. In it, the protagonist, played by Carrey, becomes increasingly obsessed with the 23 enigma, noticing the number, or patterns connected to the number, everywhere in his life.

The digits of his birthday add up to 23. Assigning numbers to the letters of his name equals 23. Soon he begins breaking down license plates, prices on menus, and phone numbers, and rearranging them until they add up to the number 23 all well falling deeper into paranoia based on this so-called “evidence.”

I don’t really remember much of the plot beyond the obsession with the number 23. Even so, lately, I’ve been feeling more and more like Jim Carrey’s character.

Only, instead, the symptoms of my pattern noticing haven’t resulted in the development of a dark, brooding, fractured psyche. I’d say they’re manifesting into a sort of hyperaware, *Costanzaesque* exasperated annoyance.

You see, I haven’t suddenly become obsessed with any two-digit number (although that does seem to have been in vogue recently.)

No, I’ve become obsessed with noticing the effects of Private Equity. Everywhere.

For those unfamiliar with these investment firms, they buy, invest in, or take over private companies, often with the stated goal of increasing the value of the acquired firm and then selling it at a profit, usually within 3-7 years.

I won’t get into how they “unlock this value,” but suffice to say, it’s usually done using rather rapacious tactics, and by exploiting some of the worst traits of modern capitalism: When they buy veterinary clinics, they [jack up](https://www.cbc.ca/news/marketplace/marketplace-vet-corporate-ownership-1.7438239) the price for pet care. When they take over nursing homes, they reduce care and [increase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168851025001435) mortality rates. And if you work for a company owned by one of these firms, you’re immediately at [higher risk](https://pestakeholder.org/private-equity-risks/effects-of-private-equity-investments/) of losing your livelihood.

Fortunately, I haven’t been impacted as dramatically in the ways described above.  But they have begun really, really annoying me.

And I know this, because every time something in my life becomes 1% more annoying, like the protagonist in *The Number 23*, or more aptly, George Costanza, I can’t just chalk it up to coincidence and let it go.

Price went up at the plumbing supply store? Private Equity bought them 24 months ago. They replaced the fresh pastries with frozen ones at the coffee shop? Private equity owns the entire chain. I stubbed my toe this morning? Although I can’t prove it, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was somehow the fault of some dude wearing a vest in Miami.

So, in the interest of, I don’t know what exactly, here are some of the most prominent ways these companies have made my life just slightly less chill:

1.     They ruined my happy place

This might sound a bit pathetic, but when I was in high school, I got a job at a self-serve Carwash. One of the perks was free Car wash tokens, and quite quickly, I realized how relaxing it could be to leave your phone at home, and spend a few minutes away from it all, absorbed in pressure washing the dirt of your car.

Though I’ve long since left that job, for years, I’ve felt secure knowing that when work gets stressful, my team loses in overtime, or my girlfriend is having a K-drama night with her mom, for only a few dollars, I could forget about everything, if only for half an hour, and escape to my happy place: the self-serve carwash.

Only now I can’t.

PE has been buying up carwashes across North America and “unlocking value.” The result? Instead of carelessly cruising in, it’s now like I’m crossing a military check point to get past the attendant. No, I don’t need the wax, or a 7$ air freshener. No, I don’t need the ultra-package, just the basic wash (which is now 20% more expensive.) And no, I don’t want to download an app, or sign up to a subscription service. This isn’t a tech start up.

2.     No more simple business names

These firms keep buying up mom-and-pop shops, “rolling them up” into a bigger conglomerate, and enjoying the economies of scale. 

Beyond the negative effects this has on consumers (monopoly power, reducing services in less profitable areas) and employees (we no longer need 10 accounting departments, just 1, here is your pink slip), I’ve also noticed they change the names and logos.

No more Kowalski and Sons HVAC, or Mrs. Hightower’s tailoring. No more logos made by someone’s nephew who had a knack for drawing.

Now every company’s name and logo looks like some hyper modern machine learning company, and I no longer know what a company does just by seeing their name or logo on a truck or storefront. 

3.     My friend Brandon is annoying now

Remember your friend from high school that never took notes, was in all the advanced classes, helped everyone with their homework and effortlessly made straight As? He was probably also the captain of the football team and though you’d think he would be arrogant and self centered; he actually spent his weekends volunteering at a soup kitchen.

That was my friend Brandon. I ran into him a few months ago. I was sure he was doing something great. Was he curing cancer? Building bridges? Revolutionizing a new industry?

No, none of that. Like a lot of today’s best and brightest, he spends ten hours a day aligning spreadsheets and talking about deal flow. We chatted for a few minutes, and though I can forgive him for using his talents to make a handsome salary. What I can’t forgive, is what a few years in a PE firm has done to his vocabulary. “Synergy,” “Platform Investment,” “White space opportunity.,” “De-risk the exit.”  Dude, we’re in a line up for a Costco hotdog and I just asked you what you’ve been up to.

So, yea, Brandon sucks now.

4.     They’re somehow making youth sports even MORE unaffordable

Years ago, my best friend opened a barber shop, and the very first thing he did when the shop was financially stable, was to sponsor his local soccer team and pay for their jerseys.

It wasn’t a complicated business decision. There was no ROI consideration. My friend just loves soccer (and perhaps worryingly so when it comes to Messi and the Argentinean national team) and he wanted to support the game locally.

It was like something out of a Normal Rockwell painting, especially given the rising cost of youth sports.

Ever since, when I see a business logo on a local sports jersey, I make a point to look it up. Not once have I seen a PE-backed firm sponsor a local team, or support a community run event.

They have, however, started buying up local hockey rinks and charging parents a subscription fee to get access to game recordings.

5.     No more free samples

I’ve never been a fan of shopping, in particular, grocery shopping. I don’t like the lines. I hate the reminder that I have no self-control, whenever I walk by the chip aisle. And lately, I’ve not been so happy about how much I have to spend to get so little.

But I LOVE free samples. It’s quite literally one of life’s little joys. Mozzarella sticks? Chicken wings? A new line of sweet and sour marinades that I will never buy? Free samples make it all worth it.

But as PE firms have been buying up local grocery stores, local speciality stores, and food distribution businesses, I’ve seen a dramatic decrease in cheerful elderly women offering me pieces of cheese on toothpicks.

For a while, I assumed it was some post-covid by-law, until I realized that local wine store was still allowed to give out free samples.

Though I can’t prove it, I suspect that the rise of Private Equity, means that some consultant has calculated there is a higher ROI on selling ranch dressing by using coupons or digital targeting than allowing someone a free snack when they shop.

Sure, there are no free lunches, there never were. But for a moment in time, there was a lot of free samples.

6.     I can’t wear a vest anymore

I’m not a fashionista. In fact, I have no sense of fashion. But for a while I found vests pretty comfortable and added a little *je ne sais quoi* to my outfits.

But ever since PE firms have wrecked all the veterinary firms where I live, I don’t want to wear one, lest people think it’s my fault they are now getting charged $480 dollars a month for their Schnauzer’s antibiotics.

I concede that a lot of my complaints are pretty banal when it comes to the big picture. The rising inequality, the precariousness of modern jobs, the dominance of the profit margin into the services we rely on. That’s much more important than a free jalapeno popper while I look for the Greek yogurt.

But, damn I miss those jalapeno poppers.

She was diagnosed with diabetes over 5 years ago, and must eat on a regular schedule to keep her blood sugar levels in check. When she doesn’t eat, she gets combative and angry. 

During the first few years of her diagnosis there was a definite learning curve while we adjusted to her new needs. Early on, I would have to remind her to eat breakfast, since I generally eat later or on the lighter side. Since we have different morning schedules during the week, and I sometimes sleep in on the weekends, she usually has breakfast without me. 

This morning we’d planned to take some old electronics we had sitting around to a local e-waste event - she got up 45mins before I did. When I got up, we sat together and discussed plans for the day and agreed to start with the e-waste drop off, pick up something from a friend near that location, then head to a new local coffee shop nearby that we’d wanted to try for breakfast and coffee before planning the rest of our day. 

After loading everything in the car, I could sense a significant shift in her mood - her responses were curt, and she seemed upset. I asked if she wanted to shift plans and head to the local coffee shop nearby shop first before the e-waste event - she snapped that she ‘just wanted to get the drop off over with’. When we got to the e-waste location she was irritated and snapped at the volunteers. When I asked her what was wrong, she told me she hadn’t eaten yet and snapped that it was my responsibility as her partner to check in, and make sure she’d eaten before we left the house. She hadn’t eaten because she thought we were going to the new coffee shop first.

Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.

What if I don't want alcohol?

No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.

Since after the above people still asked...

I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?

We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Location/Time: Latymers, W6 8BS / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00

1r4tpc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1r4tpc3/just_paid_300_to_attend_a_pharma_conference_where/,Just paid $300 to attend a pharma conference where breakfast was Costco bagels and gas station coffee. This is where your drug prices go,"I just got back from a pharma conference and I genuinely don’t understand how the math works here.

The ticket was $300. Not some exclusive closed-door summit, just a pretty standard pharma industry conference. And for that price I got: a lanyard, access to talks in a hotel ballroom, and the saddest catering spread I’ve ever seen. We’re talking grocery store bagels, those little foil-wrapped butter pats, black coffee from an urn that’s been sitting there since 6am, and if you’re lucky some sad fruit that’s been out long enough to develop a sheen.

Meanwhile students get in for like $20. Same room. Same talks. Same terrible coffee. Nobody’s handing them a worse bagel.

So where is the $280 difference going? Because it’s clearly not the food. If they’re spending more than $15/person on catering I’d be shocked.

I asked around and apparently a huge chunk of the cost is venue rental, which sure, convention space isn’t cheap. But these conferences also have sponsor booths that companies pay $5k-$20k+ for, plus the big banner sponsors on top of that. So sponsorship revenue is already covering a massive chunk of the operating cost before a single attendee ticket gets sold.

The real answer that nobody says out loud is that they charge $300 because they know your company is paying for it, not you. The moment it’s going on an expense report, nobody cares what it costs. It’s the same reason hotels charge $7 for a bottle of water — you’re a captive audience and someone else is footing the bill.

And the student pricing proves it. They’re not losing money at $20/head. They’re filling seats that would be empty otherwise and creating future $300 customers once those students get jobs and have an employer to expense it to. It’s a customer acquisition strategy dressed up as a discount.

I’m not saying conferences have zero value — the networking is real, some of the talks are good, and there’s a reason companies send people. But can we stop pretending the ticket price has any relationship to what’s actually being delivered? You’re paying for access and a line item on a corporate budget. The bagels are just there so they can technically say “breakfast included.”

And here’s the part that actually bothers me beyond just the sticker shock. This is pharma. These conference fees, the travel, the hotels, the sponsor booths — all of it gets rolled into the operational cost of doing business. And where do those costs eventually land? On the price of medications that patients are paying for. Someone out there is rationing their insulin or skipping refills because they can’t afford their copay, and somewhere in the chain of costs that inflated that drug price is a line item for a conference where I ate a stale bagel in a Marriott ballroom. I’m not saying conferences are the main driver of drug costs — there’s way bigger fish to fry there — but it’s part of a culture where nobody questions spending because it’s all just “cost of doing business” and the patient at the end of the pipeline absorbs it.

Anyway if anyone needs me I’ll be recovering from the trauma of paying $14 for a conference center veggie wrap.",9,1771097724.0,antiwork,7,0.68,False
1r4tpbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1r4tpbt/how_i_built_daily_discipline_after_years_of_being/,How I built daily discipline after years of being inconsistent (actual practical tips),"ok so i used to be the most inconsistent person ever. like id set goals on january 1st, do great for a week, then completely fall off by january 15th. rinse and repeat for literally years.

but over the past 8 months ive actually managed to build real daily discipline and i wanted to share what worked for me because i know a lot of people struggle with this.

""first - what DIDNT work:""

motivation. waiting to ""feel motivated"" meant i never did anything

going all in too fast. trying to wake up at 5am, exercise, meditate, journal, read, learn a language, and meal prep all at once just led to burnout

relying on willpower alone. willpower is a finite resource and mine runs out by like 2pm

punishment mindset. beating myself up for missing days just made me want to quit entirely

no tracking. when i didnt track anything i had no idea if i was actually making progress or just lying to myself

""what actually worked:""

""1. stupid small starting points""

instead of ""exercise for an hour"" i started with ""put on workout clothes"". thats it. most days id end up actually exercising once i had the clothes on, but even if i didnt, i still won because i built the habit of getting ready. after a month of that being easy, i increased it.

""2. same time, same place, every day""

i picked specific times for specific habits and made them non-negotiable. 7am = morning journaling with my coffee. 6pm = evening walk. 9pm = review my day and plan tomorrow. the consistency of time and location made it automatic. i literally dont think about it anymore, i just do it because its The Time.

""3. visual tracking that i can actually see""

this was HUGE. i started using Resolve (https://getresolveapp.com/app) because it has really detailed graphs and i could see my progress over weeks and months. something about seeing the visual representation of my consistency made me not want to break the chain. also it tracks focus time so i could see not just that i ""worked on my goals"" but HOW LONG i actually worked which kept me honest.

the graphs and analytics in the app made all the difference - i could see patterns like which days i was most consistent, how my habits correlated with each other, and my overall completion rates trending upward. that visual feedback loop is what finally made discipline stick for me after years of failed attempts.

""4. weekly reviews""

every sunday night i spend 15 minutes looking at my week. what did i do well? where did i slip? why did i slip? this helped me identify patterns like ""oh i always skip habits on thursdays because i have that late meeting and im tired after"" - then i could adjust.

""5. identity shift over goals""

instead of ""i want to exercise more"" (goal), i started thinking ""im someone who exercises daily"" (identity). sounds subtle but it changed everything. when youre someone who exercises, you exercise. you dont negotiate with yourself about it.

""6. removing friction""

i set out my workout clothes the night before. i put my journal and pen on my coffee table so i see it first thing. i deleted social media apps from my phone home screen and put my habit tracker there instead. every tiny bit of friction i removed made it easier to do the right thing.

""7. accepting imperfect days""

some days i only did 50% of my habits. THATS OK. whats not ok is doing 50% one day and then saying ""welp i failed, might as well quit entirely"". progress isnt linear and one bad day doesnt erase weeks of consistency.

""8. pairing habits with things i already do""

journal while drinking morning coffee (already doing the coffee part)

review my day while brushing teeth at night (already brushing teeth)

listen to podcasts/audiobooks during my commute (already commuting)

this is called ""habit stacking"" and it works because youre not trying to add something completely new to your day, youre attaching it to existing routines.

""my current daily non-negotiables (that i actually stick to):""

10 min morning journal (just brain dump, nothing fancy)

30 min focused work on my main goal (tracked with a timer so i cant lie)

20 min movement/exercise (walk, yoga, gym, whatever)

5 min evening review (what went well, what didnt, whats the plan for tomorrow)

read for 20 min before bed instead of scrolling

thats it. notice its not 15 different habits. its 5 things that take maybe 90 minutes total. WAY more sustainable than trying to do everything.

""the biggest mindset shift:""

discipline isnt about white-knuckling your way through things you hate. its about designing your life so that the things you SHOULD do are also the easiest and most obvious things to do. remove friction from good habits, add friction to bad habits.

also discipline is a muscle. you dont go to the gym once and have huge biceps. same with this - you build it slowly over time and it gets easier.

if youre struggling with consistency, start with ONE habit. make it easy. do it at the same time every day. track it visually. review weekly. give it 30 days minimum before adding more.

We’re not normally ones to make a big song and dance about Valentine’s as we like to save money on other things. Honestly cheap bunch of flowers and a card- I’m not fussy as long as there’s been some thought behind it. 

So, we always do a liiiittle something. I.e. last year he got a voucher from work so we went for a really gorgeous meal out. We both ended up getting each other some flowers.

A few days ago, we spoke about Valentines and agreed nothing big but I did want to go to the cinema the night before. I book it days in advance to get good seats right in the part of the screen he likes. He spent today doing a really fun activity he’s wanted to do for ages that I’d booked for him as part of his birthday present back in December. I get him a little bouquet of flowers, a card, and bake him a cookie.

He comes in the door this evening and he hadn’t even written the card. He told me he got it days ago but “hasn’t had time to write it.” He had a whole chilled evening to himself just the other day. I couldn’t help but be hurt by it and he is now on the verge of tears. He won’t come near me:

“You’ve planned this whole elaborate evening” “we said we wouldn’t go full out” “you know I’m trying to save money to spend on other things for you” (i.e. an engagement ring, plans for when we’re off on a city break in a month) “now I feel like I’m not enough” “ I told you I was getting a card” “I don’t get things for you expecting anything back.” I assured him I hadn’t really spent that much money and said how it seems our ideas of “not doing a big thing” are clearly different. I spent £15 max on the whole thing.

I would have been happy with just the card but him hurrying into the bedroom to quickly write it at the last minute whilst I’m standing there with the flowers I bought yesterday so I could make sure I got the good ones…it made me feel like an after thought.

I feel like my reaction came out of this building up for the past couple of months. Again, I’m not expecting gifts or even a bouquet of flowers every so often (The only time he has done this recently is by way of apology). It’s thoughtful acts without having to ask repeatedly first…

 “I’ve done this house thing for you” “I’ll make us dinner” “I’ll book that.” “Here’s your fave cheap pack of biscuits” I’ve been trying hard not to spend too much money as I’m also saving but I still try to do things I.e. make him a nice tea, I’ll pop over to the nice coffee shop to get him a fresh coffee etc. 

Anyway, now we’re both spending our valentines night in separate rooms just not speaking to each other.

The hills above Lake Atitlán are more than scenic ridges. For centuries, they have been pathways connecting farming villages, weaving communities, and lakeside markets. The route from Godínez down to Santa Catarina Palopó follows these ancestral paths, where people carried crops, textiles, and handmade goods long before roads and tourism arrived.

Today, this hike offers a rare chance to walk through living artisan landscapes, from quiet highland fields to one of the most visually distinctive weaving villages in Guatemala.

[**Godínez**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/lakeatitlanguatemalatravel)**: Highland Agriculture and Rural Craft Traditions**

Godínez is a highland town perched above Lake Atitlán, surrounded by pine forests and volcanic soil that has supported agriculture for generations. The community has historically been Kaqchikel Maya, with families relying on maize, beans, vegetables, and later coffee cultivation.

While Godínez is not known as a major weaving center, households traditionally produced practical textiles for daily use, including blankets, carrying cloths, and clothing woven on backstrap looms. The town’s isolation from mass tourism has helped preserve rural rhythms, with markets, small workshops, and family farms still forming the core of local life.",1,1771097460.0,EthicalFashionGuatema,0,1.0,False

Ever noticed how a box of crayons can feel like pure magic to a child?  
No batteries. No WiFi. Just imagination in every shade.  

I still remember watching my niece at the kitchen table — tongue slightly out in concentration — coloring the same flower three different ways because, in her world, perfection wasn’t the point. That’s when it hit me: **coloring is education disguised as fun.**

🧠 Here’s what most people don’t realize:  
• Coloring improves fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination.  
• It helps develop color recognition and pattern awareness — prerequisites for reading and math.  
• It teaches patience, focus, and emotional regulation (seriously, try coloring after a stressful day).  

And when the pages are designed with bold, simple artwork, something even more powerful happens — kids feel *confident*. They can fill in a page and see the result of their creativity right away. That little win builds self-esteem (and gives parents five peaceful minutes with their coffee ☕).  

That’s why I put together a **free kids coloring ebook**, full of joyful, age-friendly designs meant to calm the mind *and* spark curiosity. It’s perfect for homes, classrooms, and even those “I’m bored” moments during summer break:  
👉 [Grab your free download here](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)  

Parents and teachers who’ve tried it tell me coloring time has become their secret “reset button.” Kids color, relax, then focus better on reading, writing, and other activities. It’s learning through calm — something our fast world desperately needs.  

If you haven’t introduced mindful coloring to your routine yet, this is your sign.  
🎁 [Download the free ebook now](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook) and explore pages full of kind monsters, happy shapes, and gentle prompts designed for curious, creative minds.  

And while you’re at it, share it with another parent, teacher, or caregiver who could use an extra tool (and extra peace) in their day.  
Because one coloring page might just change a child’s afternoon — or their entire outlook on learning.

""the ones that didnt work (for me at least):""

apps that tried to do everything - meditation, habits, goals, journaling, fitness tracking, meal planning. they sound great in theory but theyre so bloated that i never actually used 90% of the features and it just felt overwhelming

anything with a super aggressive paywall - like you download it and cant do ANYTHING without subscribing. instant delete

apps with toxic productivity culture vibes - you know the ones where its like ""wake up at 4am! cold showers! be a LION not a SHEEP!"" yeah those just made me feel bad about myself

gamification apps where you battle monsters or whatever - i know some people love habitica but for me it was just extra noise

""what i learned actually matters:""

""1. you need to see progress visually"" - this was huge for me. apps that just had a list of checkmarks didnt motivate me at all. but when i could see graphs and streaks and patterns over time, it clicked. our brains are visual and seeing that progress chart go up hits different than just knowing intellectually that youve done something 10 days in a row.

""2. less is more with features"" - the apps i stuck with did like 2-3 things really well instead of 50 things poorly. i'd rather have an amazing habit tracker than a mediocre habit tracker + mediocre meditation timer + mediocre journal.

""3. friction is the enemy"" - if it takes more than 2 taps to log something, i wont do it consistently. the best apps ive used have widgets, shortcuts, and make it absurdly easy to track stuff.

""4. you need SOME accountability"" - whether thats seeing your streak, or having data you can review weekly, or even just the app asking ""hey you havent logged today"". complete freedom meant i just...didnt do it.

""my current setup that actually works:""

for habits and focus tracking, i use Resolve (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resolve-build-habits-focus/id6757266277) - its one of those newer apps that combines habit tracking with a focus timer and journaling. the thing i love about it is the graphs are actually detailed (you can see patterns over weeks/months), it tracks how much time you actually spend working vs just saying you worked, and the journaling is flexible (you can type, voice record, or just add images). no annoying gamification, just clean data and visual progress.

for reading, i just use the built-in books app and goodreads. nothing fancy needed there.

for fitness, i use the basic apple fitness/health app because i dont need anything complicated, just step counts and workout logging.

""actual tips that helped me stick with it:""

start with like 2-3 habits max, not 15. i was way too ambitious at first

review your progress every sunday. i set a recurring calendar event and actually look at my data for 10 minutes. its motivating and helps me adjust

dont beat yourself up for missing days. the app will show you that you still have like an 80% completion rate which is WAY better than 0%

pair habit tracking with something you already do (i check my habits right after my morning coffee)

if an app stresses you out or feels like a chore, DELETE IT. the point is to improve your life not add more anxiety

honestly the biggest game changer was when i stopped looking for the ""perfect"" app and just committed to ONE system for at least 30 days. you can have the best app in the world but if you dont actually use it consistently it doesnt matter.

hope this helps someone whos in the same boat i was in! happy to answer questions about any specific apps ive tried.",0,1771097350.0,ProductivityApps,1,0.5,False

It was simple, but it felt so thoughtful and intentional.

If you’re coming out of heartbreak or feeling discouraged, I just want to say there is hope. Healthy love isn’t loud or dramatic. Sometimes it looks like breakfast made for you on a random morning.

1r4tf89,https://open.substack.com/pub/davidrmann3/p/ive-managed-ten-dining-rooms-the?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&utm_medium=web,I’ve Managed Ten Dining Rooms. The Teams’ Guests Remember All Do The Same Three Things.,"**I’ve Managed Ten Dining Rooms. The Teams’ Guests Remember All Do The Same Three Things.**

The first time I watched my own dining room turn invisible, it was a Saturday night.

The tickets wouldn’t stop. The printer sounded like a fire alarm. I was in the alley between the bar and the expo window, waving my arms like a traffic cop, trying to keep guests, servers, runners from colliding.

My team was moving fast. They weren’t engaging.

They hit their numbers. They dropped food. They checked boxes. They had zero capacity left for eye contact. Jokes. Reading the room. Guests were fed. They weren’t hosted.

I had a full house. Good sales. That sick feeling you get when you know people won’t be back.

I used to think guest engagement lived in hiring.

Find the “people people.” The charm. The big smiles. Put them on the floor and get out of the way.

Then I started watching those same people on busy nights.

The bartender who could work a Tuesday happy hour crowd went flat on a slammed Friday. The server who bantered with every table at brunch stared through guests at 5:30 pm when the restaurant filled up. The host who usually floated the front door like a dance floor turned stiff and clipped.

The variable wasn’t their personality. The variable was how supported and engaged they felt on shift.

The industry numbers don’t care how charming your crew is.

Restaurant turnover is still at around 75% a year across the industry. In some segments, it’s higher. That means most operators are running dining rooms where the majority of the team won’t be there next year.

At the same time, long-term research from groups like Gallup keeps showing that highly engaged teams see clear gains in customer loyalty, sales, and profitability compared to disengaged ones.

So, there’s a simple pattern. Burn your team out, and you burn guest loyalty. Engage your team, and you grow repeat business.

Most owners still treat engagement like a poster in the break room.

The Line That Won’t Leave My Head Came From A 2024 Hospitality Piece.

“Your guest experience will never exceed your employee experience.”

Walk your own floor, and you can feel that in your bones.

If your servers feel rushed, ignored, and disposable, guests feel tolerated.

If your people feel supported, recognized, and trusted, guests feel welcomed.

That isn’t abstract. It shows up in reviews. It shows up in how many regulars know your staff by name instead of by position. It shows up in how fast a bad table cools off when something goes wrong.

A lot of operators tried to fix engagement with swag, pizza, or a “family meal and a huddle” that is really a list of 86’d.

Frontline data in hospitality points somewhere else.

Scheduling fairness. Visible leadership. Real recognition from bosses and peers. When recognition quality moves from low to high, engagement jumps. Turnover intention drops hard.

So, if you want a team that feels engaging for guests in 2025 and 2026, you’re not hunting for natural charm. You’re building a system that makes engagement possible in the middle of chaos.

In every restaurant where guests talked about the staff like family, three tactics kept showing up.

**TACTIC 1: Put Engagement In The Pre Shift**

Most pre-shifts are a roll call and a menu quiz.

Who is here? Who is cut? What is 86’d? What is the soup?

Then the doors open, and you pray the team suddenly tunes into the humans walking in.

The best engagement nights in my rooms started in the pre-shift, not in section one.

We cut the speech. We turned it into a five-minute ritual with three pieces:

One guest story from last shift. By name, if we had it.

One clear focus for how we will engage tonight.

One micro recognition in front of the group.

“Last night, table #9 was a couple from out of town here for a funeral. Sarah caught it, slowed down, got them dessert on us, and they left hugging her. Tonight, our focus is on reading the first two minutes at every table. Ask one real question before you launch the specials. Before we start, shout out to Chris for catching three allergies on Friday.”

Then we open the doors.

No corporate script. No fake hype. Just a behavior target and a story that makes it real.

Engagement stops being a word and becomes an action.

You can lift that pattern into any operation. Swap out “dessert” and “allergies” for whatever service moment matters in your world. The logic holds.

**TACTIC 2: Give Your Team Permission To Fix Problems On The Spot**

Nothing kills guest engagement faster than a server who has to “check with my manager” for every fix.

You can see the moment it dies. The guest’s shoulders go up. The server’s eyes drop. The connection is gone.

In one of my rooms, we ran a tight approval culture. Only managers comped. Only managers handled complaints. Only managers could move tables once someone was seated.

We thought this protected margins.

What it did was teach the team not to own anything that felt risky.

Guests learned it too. They stopped asking their server for help and went straight to the host stand with a tight voice and a phone in their hand, review app open and ready.

When we started losing regulars, I pulled six months of comps and guest notes.

Most of what we “protected” were small items. Desserts. Drinks. A round of coffees when the kitchen dragged. What cost us were the reviews and the tables we never saw again.

So we flipped it.

We gave every server a real comp budget per shift.

We set clear rules on when they could move tables or invite a manager in. We trained calm phrases for heat moments. Then we told them this part out loud.

“If you use this budget to take care of guests, you won’t get in trouble for it. Even if I had made a different call.”

In the first few weeks, people tested the edge.

Then it settled.

Complaints got handled at the table. I watched servers kneel, listen, fix, and then stay present with that table instead of hiding in the service station.

I watched guests soften because someone in an apron treated them like a person, not a ticket.

The surprise was what happened behind the scenes.

A server who believes they can fix things walks different. They check on more tables. They lean in. They joke again. They ask follow-up questions.

They engage because they don’t feel powerless.

That pattern fits any frontline job. Call centers. Hotels. Retail floors. Give people authority tied to trust and watch how they show up.

**TACTIC 3: Catch People In The Act Of Caring**

You can’t order someone to care.

You can make care contagious.

The strongest engagement tool I know is boring on paper and brutal in practice.

Catch people doing the behavior you want, name it in public, and tie it to the impact on guests.

It’s not “good job team, great service tonight.”

That kind of praise is noise. No one remembers it.

Real recognition sounds like this.

“During that ten top at 6:30, the kids were melting down. Mike grabbed extra napkins before the drinks hit the table, got them lids, kept checking back with the parents in a calm way. They left laughing instead of drained. That is what family-friendly looks like here.”

Then you say that where the team can hear it.

Frontline research shows that when leaders recognize people at least monthly in a specific, believable way, engagement climbs and people are less likely to think about leaving.

So, you stop saving recognition for quarterly meetings. You bake it into pre-shift, post shift, small huddles on the floor.

Two rules kept it honest in my places.

Name the behavior, not the personality.

Connect it to a guest outcome.

“You’re so friendly” does nothing. “You noticed that couple was on a first date and paced their courses so they could talk without feeling rushed” tells everyone what to copy.

The universal pattern here is simple. People repeat what you notice.

If all you talk about is sales and speed, they will sell hard and move fast.

If you talk about how they see guests, they start looking.

**All Three Tactics Have The Same Foundation.**

As the boss or manager, you stop treating engagement like a mood the staff should bring from home.

You treat it like it’s part of the job that you designed.

Short pre-shifts that point their attention to real humans. Real authority to fix problems without waiting for you. Constant, specific recognition for the kind of care you want more of.

You also stop pretending this is optional.

Consumer surveys on restaurant experience keep showing that guests rank friendly, hospitable staff as the single most important part of a positive visit.

It’s not your clever menu design or your decor.

If staff engagement is that central to guest loyalty, it belongs in the same bucket as food safety and cash handling.

**The Hard Truth.**

You can’t build this from the office.

You have to be on the floor, not just to run food or clear plates, but to watch what your people deal with in real time.

Where do they hesitate to approach a table? Where do they reach for you instead of speaking? Where do they light up? Where do they shut down?

Those little moments are your design brief.

If your line cooks never look up. Your bartenders drown in dishes. Your host stand is running human Tetris with a kiosk barking times at them. No engagement script will stick.

You have to clear space in the system before you ask for more emotional labor.

Cut one piece of side work that adds no value. Add one runner on peak nights. Shrink sections on your heaviest turns. Trade a few covers for the chance that each table feels seen.

The spreadsheets already tell you what happens when you don’t. High turnover. Flat engagement. Lower guest loyalty.

The floor tells you what happens when you do.

**If You Want Something Practical To Try This Week, Start Here.**

Tonight, pick one pre-shift. Spend five minutes on one guest story from last week, one engagement focus, and one specific recognition.

During the shift, give every server a small, clear boundary for on-the-spot fixes. Tell them you back their good faith calls.

After close, name three concrete moments when someone engaged a guest in a way you want to see again. Say it so others hear it.

Do that for a month.

Watch what happens to the noise level at the server station, the tone of your reviews, and the look on your team’s faces at 8:30 pm on a slammed Friday.

If you have a tactic that changed how your team shows up for guests, share it. Operators need real stories, not posters.

I’m sorry I misread our messages. I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable. And I’m especially sorry if I pushed you away. It wasn’t fair of me to ask you out for coffee, and it wasn’t fair of me to hope you might want to be more than an online friend. That expectation was mine alone, and I’m sorry for placing it on you.

I think, in hindsight, I fell in love with the idea of you rather than the reality of who you are. The truth is, we barely knew each other we only knew each other’s names. I don’t even know basic things about you. Are you gay? Are you even a woman? That should’ve been my reality check.

I’m also sorry I blocked you. But I need to be honest about that, too I did it because I had to. From my perspective, it started to feel like I was just another obligation in your life, something you checked off rather than chose. And that perception took a real toll on my mental health. I miss you every day, but I also know that keeping you blocked is helping me grow stronger and healthier.

I’m sorry it came to this. You’ll always mean something to me, even if that something was never truly real. I wanted it to be real because, in a way, you saved my life. Before we started talking, I was in a very dark place closer than I want to admit to ending things. You became a light during that time, a kind of anchor when everything else felt unbearable. You were my constant, my spark in the dark.

I didn’t mean to fall in love with you and yes, I know how that sounds. But you were everything I thought I wanted: a geek who spoke her mind, someone who vibed with me, laughed at my terrible jokes, and just got me. I fell for you before I ever knew what you looked like, and when I did see you, you felt impossibly beautiful not just physically, but because of your mind and attitude.

I know how unhealthy that sounds. I know how unbalanced it became.

When the internship came up and I got in so easily, I convinced myself it was fate. And I know that probably sounds unsettling, too. I guess the real reason I’m writing this today is because I wondered did I ever mean anything to you at all?

Maybe I did, at least a little. Or maybe the idea of us moving from a digital space into the real world scared you. And if that’s the case, then my feelings put pressure on something that mattered deeply to me a friendship that meant more than I knew how to protect at the time.

You saved my life, even if I never meant much to yours. You were my world, and I was never meant to be yours. Maybe in another life, with better timing and healthier boundaries, it could have worked.

My first son turns 3 in 1.5 month. He is aware of the concept of birthday and we’ve been preparing him for a week or so that his brother’s birthday is coming up. Today he woke up before the baby, I got up with him and we had some cocoa and coffee time and cuddles on the couch while looking at his and his brothers photos and his photos from his previous birthdays. Everything was fine, then baby woke up, we went up to say happy birthday and all hell broke loose. My older child who is usually a pretty well behaved, smart and independent toddler and a fairly decent big brother went nuts. There was not a minute (and I was solo parenting them for a few hours as my husband had to work) that my toddler who usually I’d pretty cooperative and solo plays quite a bunch (with big kid Lego on the grown up table where the baby doesn’t reach it) started to act out in the craziest ways imaginable. Not a single minute without trying to get my attention, hitting his brother or stealing his toys, acting like a baby to get my help, meltdowns, whining, hitting his brother, running away in his muddy shoes to the couch and covering himself with blankets when usually he is awesome with getting dressed up and down. EVERYTHING. He managed to make his brother cry more in the span of 5 hours than he did over the last 6 months. THERE WAS LITERALLY NOT A SINGLE MINUTE OF CALM. The entire half of the day I spent not paying any actual attention to the birthday boy, because my toddler was misbehaving so badly. I tried talking to him calmly about big feelings and being jealous, I tried ignoring bad behaviours, I tried explaining that today is his brother birthday but hell have his own soon, I got him a small gift so he doesn’t feel jealous, we went outside so he can get his energy out, everything. Any tiny interaction with the baby that I tried to have or any time I didnt pay attention to the toddler fully he would get absolutely crazy in the worst way possible. I yelled at him more today that i had over the last year at least. I hate this. After my husband came back we tried handling the toddler but he kept doing same, inserting himself in everything his brother got engaged with. I called my mom crying to take the toddler out so we managed to pay some attention and have some quality time with the baby in the end but I feel SOOOO GUILTY about everything. Once the toddler came back from grandmas place we were nice to him and acted normal. My fear is - tomorrow we have a big family party for the baby and I’m fearing for everyone’s life at the moment. 

I’d take any words of comfort, any advice, anything.

My toddler is usually trying to steal attention from the baby but never even close to this extent. I feel guilty over not paying enough attention to the baby because the toddler is so freaking tiring. I love them both to pieces but I’m so so so lost right now.",3,1771096633.0,2under2,5,1.0,False

 So this Valentine’s week got me thinking a bit more than usual 😅
I’m 24 Straight Male, working in tech in Mumbai (frontend/devops space), into fitness, finance, and career growth. I’ve been told I look decent and I do get attention sometimes at work or socially — but here’s the honest part: I’m terrible at initiating conversations with women.
Maybe Im bit of shy and overthinker.
I’ve focused heavily on career and self-growth the last couple of years and somewhere along the way but, dating/social confidence didn’t get equal reps. I don’t drink, not into clubbing scenes, more of a gym,  spirituality, long walk, deep conversation type guy.
So this is me trying something different.
I just want to fix my flaws which I obviously know but cant fix em alone need someone to spot me so that i can correct em.

If there are any women from Mumbai here who:

Happy to just chat here or over a call first. Meeting in person is optional and only if both of us feel comfortable — preferably in a public place.
Appreciate genuine effort over smooth talk
I Prefer public, safe, no-pressure meetups (coffee, walk near ur location (I stay near vikhroli/powai)
Are also tired of low-effort dating culture
I’d actually love advice — or even a conversation.
No rush, no expectations. Just two normal humans meeting in a public place and seeing if conversation flows.
Also open to honest feedback from women here: what makes someone easier to approach? What makes you feel safe and comfortable when a guy initiates?

I got up and looked around to see if I could find the source...nothing.

Story is pretty typical. Started at 1mg, then 2mg, and went up to 3mg on week 5. I'll probably stay on 3mg or maybe even drop back to 2.5mg because appetite suppression and fullness is very strong.

The slowing loss on the graph was purposeful: I didn't want to lose too much too fast so I intentionally ate denser calorie foods.

As far as side effects go, the biggest observations have been some stomach upset when eating fatty foods (pizza, chinese food). Also I went from three cups of coffee in the morning to one because the caffeine hits so much harder now.

1r4t439,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1r4t439/crazy_is_scary/,Crazy is Scary,"When thinking about fear, she ponders mostly about jump scenes and gore porn. But what about the terrors of reality? The misreading of the mind? The untreatable ailment that invades her nervous system, this alone force only being able to be contained but never being able to be expelled. What was reality if not frightening in its honest ways. Predators were on the streets, children were going missing, and there were people who were losing their grasp of reality and sliding into a dark abyss of unnerving perturbations. What was fear if not darkness, and what was darkness without facing the truth? It’s what she defined fear as. Her fear was her own reality, and that reality was instability built on the weak foundation of fear. 

She knew what it felt like to lose her mind. The numb wiggling panic that squirms around her bones could be felt in her hands, the way her fingers curled into tight fists, nails pressing harsh crescents into her palms. Sometimes the force was so great it left little red marks, proof that the fear was real and not imagined. The impending doom sat like lead, making her veins too heavy to operate correctly. Too heavy. She has ripped out her hair and cursed the world while being perplexed, and while disappointment rocked her shoulders radically with intense sobs. Lost. To just not know about anything anymore as she watched her reality become distorted and blurred before her eyes as if her mind were miraging a nightmare before her. The unraveling of brain matter as each stretched tube twisted and squirmed through the others, trying its best to come to terms with what it really is anymore. Hopeless. She knew the pain of a poisoned sanity losing its grip on a battle that never stood a chance to begin with. She knew what it was like to feel feeble and decrepit, standing before the mighty force of lucidity, watching its towers crumble to sand in her mind. All gone. She knew the folly in believing that her sanity stood stable and solid while the creep in the back of her spine whispered to her things that were the real truth. Ignoring the hairs standing to their tips as high as they can go, they prickled across her skin as a warning of what is to come. Stop. The foreboding sense that her verisimilitude was beginning to crack and her truth of life around her shifted, starting as a simple touch that would leave her mental state tumbling into an invisible avalanche that would roar inside of her with silent screams.

She knew what it felt like to not be real. She has looked through her own eyes as another person shifted into gear in her brain and took charge of every physical and mental aspect, which made her who she is. With that new persona now in charge and her mind locked in a box, watching through cracks as what was once her life shifts away under someone else’s control. She knew the sound as the gun locked and loaded when someone else barged in to now take over her now mangled brain. She knew what it was like to get looks of pity from onlookers who had no idea of the turmoil that boiled beneath her flesh. She even accepted that, at no point in her life, would she ever be or look normal. She knew what it was to smile away demons and wink away monsters. She didn't mean to be so interesting and provocative, but her ailment was a vice on her soul that puppeteered her in all sorts of ways. She could look out right now at an existence that has no blemish and find that boil that hides behind a bush, only to expose it and set it on fire. Destruction was not something she craved; it was more of an accomplice that came with her being unwell. 

That’s what she was, wasn't it? Unwell? To her, it didn't matter if she was unwell, sick, demented, insane… All she wanted was some kind of stability. A hard rock ground where she could plant her feet, whether through any storm or assault. But as of now, she had none of what she wished for; instead, she was just a thin string caught in a current, the string being too weak to pull itself out of the rapid embrace. Her mind was taut and fraying, trembling with the weight of everything she could not control, always on the verge of snapping. She was disoriented with a stack of different emotions, each one tugging on that fragile thread, threatening to unravel her completely. She understood the earthworming curl that twirled around her veins, bloating them with so much terror that the blood vessels became engorged and began to emit the deadly fumes of inconsolable fear. There was no recovery from the trauma that came with the pain of losing her mind. There were things in life that were silly, or crazy, and sometimes a little COO COO. She was none of those things. She was a splinter of glass wedged into her mind, twisting and squirming her into nothing more than emotional guts and gushes.

She knew what it was like to be nothing but matter, no longer a person, a creation, or even a being, but now a simple structure made from the most minimalistic material, molded into something barely stable enough to function. There was a pure, emotional foreboding when her eyes opened to a new day. Bile prickled the back of her throat with the sunrise, and then came the ritual: she pressed her palm to the cold wall, letting herself balance just a moment before she staggered out of bed. Her fingers flicked on the bathroom light, white glare stinging her eyes, and her knees met the tile, hard and familiar. Her body guided itself, step after rote step, to the toilet like every other morning, and she braced herself as she spewed nothing from her empty guts but stinging yellow pus. There was a creep during every meal in which she thought ahead to the mess she was going to make in the bathroom when she made herself make it all come back up. That wasn’t a thrill that sent her body into a state of elation and pleasure. It was scary. To be her. To know her. It was scary. She knew unpredictability better than she knew her last name, which changed more frequently than her ever-changing hair color. She understood what it was when people romanticized her instability, making it look daring or even cute. But instability wasn’t a thrilling life filled with adrenaline-fueled adventures. She knew it was the specific fear of not knowing what decision her shifting mind would make before her body could even react. Each day, not knowing where she would end up that night or even whether she was gonna keep living in her house. For her, having a mind in constant flux meant never knowing anything for sure.

The flurry of emotions can rage on harder than any storm. A breakup to her wasn’t just the end of the world. It was someone physically reaching their hand through her chest and ripping out her heart. That pain. That fear. That is what came with sorrow. She knew what it meant to be more extreme than an acrobat performing all dolled up for a cheering audience. She knew what dramatics were, for the voices in her head always screamed them out in dire situations. 

\*You are alone. No one will ever understand how broken you really are.\*

There was no connection from the mind to the tongue, to the thought of rationality or cognition, to the lips from the brain. She knew what fear was just as much as she knew how frightening her sanity could be. What was the difference in fear from someone wanting to kill her or the fear of not knowing who she was sometimes? She knew it was the same adrenaline that fumed like gas in her blood from being chased by a predator, and the ear-ringing fear that grabbed her from the slip of dissociation that lasted much longer than it should have. What was fear if it was not losing her mind?

She knew the exhaustion that came like a tsunami in the aftermath of her devastation. She knew the carnage left from the car crash was an increment of her life. Searching for cures. Seeking answers. Looking in every possible place to hide and cower away from the monster that she couldn’t help but release with just a few actions. The ever pressing weight of failure was more than just a stone in her gut, but the feeling of every nerve ending being seared off one strand at a time. The over-analysis and hyper fixation were jumping up and down on her lungs like children on a trampoline, making her breathing inconsistent and raspy. Fuck. A big coagulated mess of flesh and bone pushed together and held up by only self-pity and depression. Sometimes it was the warm cup of coffee in the morning that ignited her soul with positivity… only to be broken down by the low self-worth she has for herself from strangers she doesn’t know. Gratification. Maybe that’s what she was searching for. Recognition. Was that what would send her optimism ablaze? 

She knew what it was to sit and ponder every detail of her life, with meticulous eyes overseeing every wrong decision she had ever made. Everyone that she caused. Everyone was her fault. Manic laughter and hysterical tears all at once were a horrific sight to behold. A manic way of releasing all that bubbling venom that needs to be expelled from the body. She knew that some saw this as a sickness, but all she could see in it was the trepidation and apprehension that came with nothing more than existing. She knew all about crazy, and she knew that to most people it was nothing more than some joke to be laughed about. She knew some people got that it was serious if it were actually true, but brushed off if someone was malingering with the ailment they claimed. Life was tough for everyone, and everyone was going through their own trials and tribulations, and she wished more than anything she were normal enough to wade through those waters without splashing around like a lunatic.

But what about the terrors of reality? The misreading of the mind? The untreatable ailment that invades her nervous system, this alone force only being able to be contained but never being able to be expelled. What was reality if not frightening in its honest ways. Predators were on the streets, children were going missing, and there were people who were losing their grasp of reality and sliding into a dark abyss of unnerving perturbations. What was fear if not darkness, and what was darkness without facing the truth? It’s what she defined fear as.

She knew what it felt like to lose her mind. The numb wiggling panic that squirms around her bones could be felt in her hands, the way her fingers curled into tight fists, nails pressing harsh crescents into her palms. Sometimes the force was so great it left little red marks, proof that the fear was real and not imagined. The impending doom sat like lead, making her veins too heavy to operate correctly. Too heavy.

To just not know about anything anymore as she watched her reality become distorted and blurred before her eyes as if her mind were miraging a nightmare before her.

She knew the folly in believing that her sanity stood stable and solid while the creep in the back of her spine whispered to her things that were the real truth. Ignoring the hairs standing to their tips as high as they can go, they prickled across her skin as a warning of what is to come. Stop. The foreboding sense that her verisimilitude was beginning to crack and her truth of life around her shifted, starting as a simple touch that would leave her mental state tumbling into an invisible avalanche that would roar inside of her with silent screams.

She knew what it felt like to not be real. She has looked through her own eyes as another person shifted into gear in her brain and took charge of every physical and mental aspect, which made her who she is. With that new persona now in charge and her mind locked in a box, watching through cracks as what was once her life shifts away under someone else’s control. She knew the sound as the gun locked and loaded when someone else barged in to now take over her now mangled brain. She knew what it was like to get looks of pity from onlookers who had no idea of the turmoil that boiled beneath her flesh. She even accepted that, at no point in her life, would she ever be or look normal. She knew what it was to smile away demons and wink away monsters. She didn't mean to be so interesting and provocative, but her ailment was a vice on her soul that puppeteered her in all sorts of ways. She could look out right now at an existence that has no blemish and find that boil that hides behind a bush, only to expose it and set it on fire. Destruction was not something she craved; it was more of an accomplice that came with her being unwell. 

That’s what she was, wasn't it? Unwell? To her, it didn't matter if she was unwell, sick, demented, insane… All she wanted was some kind of stability. A hard rock ground where she could plant her feet, whether through any storm or assault. But as of now, she had none of what she wished for; instead, she was just a thin string caught in a current, the string being too weak to pull itself out of the rapid embrace. Her mind was taut and fraying, trembling with the weight of everything she could not control, always on the verge of snapping. She was disoriented with a stack of different emotions, each one tugging on that fragile thread, threatening to unravel her completely. She understood the earthworming curl that twirled around her veins, bloating them with so much terror that the blood vessels became engorged and began to emit the deadly fumes of inconsolable fear. There was no recovery from the trauma that came with the pain of losing her mind. There were things in life that were silly, or crazy, and sometimes a little COO COO. She was none of those things. She was a splinter of glass wedged into her mind, twisting and squirming her into nothing more than emotional guts and gushes.

She knew what it was like to be nothing but matter, no longer a person, a creation, or even a being, but now a simple structure made from the most minimalistic material, molded into something barely stable enough to function. There was a pure, emotional foreboding when her eyes opened to a new day. Bile prickled the back of her throat with the sunrise, and then came the ritual: she pressed her palm to the cold wall, letting herself balance just a moment before she staggered out of bed. Her fingers flicked on the bathroom light, white glare stinging her eyes, and her knees met the tile, hard and familiar. Her body guided itself, step after rote step, to the toilet like every other morning, and she braced herself as she spewed nothing from her empty guts but stinging yellow pus. There was a creep during every meal in which she thought ahead to the mess she was going to make in the bathroom when she made herself make it all come back up. That wasn’t a thrill that sent her body into a state of elation and pleasure. It was scary. To be her. To know her. It was scary. She knew unpredictability better than she knew her last name, which changed more frequently than her ever-changing hair color. She understood what it was when people romanticized her instability, making it look daring or even cute. But instability wasn’t a thrilling life filled with adrenaline-fueled adventures. She knew it was the specific fear of not knowing what decision her shifting mind would make before her body could even react. Each day, not knowing where she would end up that night or even whether she was gonna keep living in her house. For her, having a mind in constant flux meant never knowing anything for sure.

The flurry of emotions can rage on harder than any storm. A breakup to her wasn’t just the end of the world. It was someone physically reaching their hand through her chest and ripping out her heart. That pain. That fear. That is what came with sorrow. She knew what it meant to be more extreme than an acrobat performing all dolled up for a cheering audience. She knew what dramatics were, for the voices in her head always screamed them out in dire situations.

1r4t3ne,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentTexts/comments/1r4t3ne/what_im_thinking_about_today/,What I’m thinking about today,"Welp, it’s Valentine’s Day, and I’ve had you blocked for a few weeks now. So I guess all I really need to say is that I’m sorry.

I’m sorry I misread our messages. I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable. And I’m especially sorry if I pushed you away. It wasn’t fair of me to ask you out for coffee, and it wasn’t fair of me to hope you might want to be more than an online friend. That expectation was mine alone, and I’m sorry for placing it on you.

I think, in hindsight, I fell in love with the idea of you rather than the reality of who you are. The truth is, we barely knew each other we only knew each other’s names. I don’t even know basic things about you. Are you gay? Are you even a woman? That should’ve been my reality check.

I’m also sorry I blocked you. But I need to be honest about that, too I did it because I had to. From my perspective, it started to feel like I was just another obligation in your life, something you checked off rather than chose. And that perception took a real toll on my mental health. I miss you every day, but I also know that keeping you blocked is helping me grow stronger and healthier.

I’m sorry it came to this. You’ll always mean something to me, even if that something was never truly real. I wanted it to be real because, in a way, you saved my life. Before we started talking, I was in a very dark place closer than I want to admit to ending things. You became a light during that time, a kind of anchor when everything else felt unbearable. You were my constant, my spark in the dark.

I didn’t mean to fall in love with you and yes, I know how that sounds. But you were everything I thought I wanted: a geek who spoke her mind, someone who vibed with me, laughed at my terrible jokes, and just got me. I fell for you before I ever knew what you looked like, and when I did see you, you felt impossibly beautiful not just physically, but because of your mind and attitude.

I know how unhealthy that sounds. I know how unbalanced it became.

When the internship came up and I got in so easily, I convinced myself it was fate. And I know that probably sounds unsettling, too. I guess the real reason I’m writing this today is because I wondered did I ever mean anything to you at all?

Maybe I did, at least a little. Or maybe the idea of us moving from a digital space into the real world scared you. And if that’s the case, then my feelings put pressure on something that mattered deeply to me a friendship that meant more than I knew how to protect at the time.

You saved my life, even if I never meant much to yours. You were my world, and I was never meant to be yours. Maybe in another life, with better timing and healthier boundaries, it could have worked. But here we are unbalanced, blocked, farther apart than ever… and yet somehow closer than I expected we’d be in memory and real life.",4,1771096277.0,UnsentTexts,1,1.0,False

She knew some people got that it was serious if it were actually true, but brushed off if someone was malingering with the ailment they claimed. Life was tough for everyone, and everyone was going through their own trials and tribulations, and she wished more than anything she were normal enough to wade through those waters without splashing around like a lunatic.

Why couldn’t she be calm? Ever? 

Why couldn’t she be still and reasonable?

Just one long breath of quiet, she thought.

But the silence always broke too soon.

She wasn’t scared of the boogie man or the monster that lived in her closet. She made friends with the demons that hunted her in her dreams. But reality still filled her with a different fear, the kind that lingered long after the screams faded. When the quaking stopped, she was left standing in a landscape reshaped by silent aftershocks, dust sifting through the air, everything familiar changed in the hush that followed. In that settling quiet, she realized the world might never stop trembling inside her.",1,1771096247.0,Nonsleep,0,1.0,False

Or maybe you just want to brainstorm a few creative ideas for social media content. In the past, that meant hours of frustration and endless revisions. But times have changed. Now everyone has access to an incredible resource—**free ChatGPT online**. It's not just a trendy gimmick; it's a full-fledged productivity tool that's completely transforming how we tackle everyday tasks.

In this article, we won't just skim the surface. We'll dive deep into the world of possibilities that free ChatGPT unlocks, break down how to use it to its fullest potential, and show why the online ChatGPT generator has become an indispensable companion for millions of users worldwide.

**What is ChatGPT and why is everyone talking about it?**

Let's start from the beginning. ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI. In simple terms, it's a highly sophisticated algorithm trained on a massive amount of text data. It understands context, picks up on language nuances, and can carry on meaningful conversations. But for regular users like us, it's simply a **smart free chatbot** that's always ready to help.

Why all the hype? Because it's the first tool of its kind to truly go mainstream. This isn't some program spitting out canned responses. It's **free online artificial intelligence** that can reason, create, and even crack jokes. It breaks down the barriers between human questions and machine answers, making the interaction feel completely natural.

**The reality today: Is there really an accessible free ChatGPT?**

The biggest question for newcomers: ""Is this actually free?"" Yes—the basic version of ChatGPT is completely free. OpenAI makes the model available to everyone so people can try the technology and see what it can do.

Of course, there are paid tiers—Plus, Go, Pro, and others—that offer priority access to the newest models, faster responses, and higher limits. But for the vast majority of everyday tasks, the **free online ChatGPT** is more than enough. You can ask questions, write text, and never worry about a bill. It undercuts the competition completely—why pay for questionable alternatives when there's an official, powerful tool available to everyone?

**Under the hood: What can the free online AI actually do in practice?**

A lot of people think online text neural networks are only useful for students writing papers or copywriters churning out formulaic articles. But its applications go way beyond that. Let's look at real scenarios where **free ChatGPT** can genuinely make your life easier.

**Writing text of any complexity**

This is probably its most popular feature. Need to draft a professional email to a partner? ChatGPT can do it in a minute, nailing the right tone. Need a wedding toast? Easy! It handles any genre—from Instagram posts to technical documentation. The key is giving it the right instructions.

**Brainstorming and generating ideas online**

We've all been there: staring at a blank page with zero ideas. That creative block is universal. That's where the **online ChatGPT generator** shines as the perfect ""idea machine."" Type something like, ""Give me 10 YouTube video topic ideas about traveling in Russia,"" and seconds later you've got a list ranging from basic to wildly creative. You build on those ideas, mix them, expand them—and suddenly the creative flow is back!

**Learning languages and programming**

**Free online artificial intelligence** is also an excellent tutor. Practice English just by chatting with the bot—it corrects your mistakes, explains grammar, and adjusts to your level. For programmers, ChatGPT is a game-changer: it writes code, breaks down tricky sections, helps debug, and even acts as a mentor explaining why one approach beats another. It's a powerhouse **AI assistant for writing and debugging code**.

**Creating together: How to get the most out of the neural network for online text generation**

To get truly high-quality results from your **free smart chatbot**, you need to learn how to ""talk"" to it. This skill is called **prompt engineering**.

**Secrets of the perfect prompt**

Think of ChatGPT as a very eager but extremely literal intern. If you say ""write text,"" it'll do it—but the result probably won't wow you. The more precise and detailed your request, the better the output.

* Bad prompt: ""Write about coffee.""
* Good prompt: ""Write a blog post for a coffee shop. Target audience: young people 25-35 who want to brew great coffee at home. Tone: friendly and expert. Length: about 2,000 characters. Structure: introduction, choosing beans, grinding, three brewing methods (Turkish coffee, French press, pour-over), conclusion.""

See the difference? In the second case, **online ChatGPT** already understands the context, audience, and structure—so you get something almost ready to publish.

**Roles and scenarios for your AI writing assistant**

ChatGPT can take on different personas. Use that! At the start of a chat, assign it a role:

* ""You are a professional marketer with 10 years of experience.""
* ""You are a strict Russian language teacher grading an essay for errors.""
* ""You are an experienced psychologist giving advice on beating stress.""

Assigning a role automatically tunes the style and depth of its responses. It turns your **online AI chat** from a basic bot into an expert in whatever field you need.

**No delays: The advantages of free ChatGPT with no registration and instant access**

Registration has always been a major barrier to new tech—coming up with passwords, verifying email, solving captchas... it wastes time and energy. Developers get that. That's why many services now offer **free ChatGPT without registration** or at least let you test the features without creating an account.

You just visit the site and start chatting. It's incredibly convenient when you need the tool right now—for a quick translation, a headline brainstorm, or fast advice. No sign-up lowers the entry barrier to zero, making the technology truly accessible. You can use **ChatGPT without downloading anything**, straight in your browser, on any device—from a powerful desktop to an old phone.

**Comparison: Why is chatting with online AI better than traditional work methods?**

Let's be real: why bother with AI when we have Google and books?

First, **speed**. A search engine gives you a million links you have to open, read, analyze, and piece together in your head. ChatGPT delivers a ready-made, structured answer tailored to your exact question.

Second, **interactivity**. It's a real conversation! You can clarify details, ask for rewrites, follow up. You can't have that kind of back-and-forth with Google.

Third, **creativity**. The **online idea generator** pulls from its vast knowledge but combines things in ways you might never have thought of. It can be the ""magic kick"" that gets you out of a creative rut.

Of course, don't blindly trust everything the **free online AI** says. It can hallucinate facts or give outdated info. But as a draft, first sketch, or routine-task helper—nothing beats it.

**ChatGPT text generator: From idea to masterpiece**

How does the magic of text generation actually work? You enter your prompt. The neural network breaks it down, analyzes keywords, draws from its ""knowledge"" (a huge training dataset), and predicts word after word to build a logically connected, grammatically correct response. It doesn't copy chunks from the internet—it creates unique text based on your request and its ""experience"" every time.

You can ask it to rewrite in a different style: turn a formal letter friendly, or make a dry article lively and engaging. The **AI writing assistant** excels at adapting content for different audiences. It's a massive time-saver for anyone who works with words.

**Hands-on guide: How to create an article with AI and still look pro?**

Say you need to write an expert article. Here's how to work with ChatGPT for high-quality results:

1. **Strategy**: Don't ask it to write everything at once. Start with an outline. Prompt: ""Create a detailed outline for an article on 'How to choose running shoes'.""
2. **Content**: Flesh out each section separately. ""Expand on the section about foot pronation types. Explain it in simple terms.""
3. **Editing**: Pull all the pieces together. Then ask ChatGPT to proofread the draft for errors and fluff. ""Remove repetitions, make the text more dynamic.""
4. **Expert touch**: Now you step in. Fact-check, add your personal experience, humanize it with real-life examples, and inject unique insights that aren't in generic data.

Only by teaming up **human + free ChatGPT** do you get truly great, valuable content. Use the neural network as a powerful tool, but don't let it do everything for you.

**No limits?: Is there really a ChatGPT without restrictions?**

Let's be realistic. The free version does have limits. They're there to keep the servers from buckling under millions of users. Limits apply to the number of messages you can send in a given time (like per hour) and access to the newest, most resource-heavy models. Hit the cap, and the bot asks you to wait a bit or upgrade to a paid plan for uninterrupted use.

But for most people, those limits are plenty. You're unlikely to hammer the neural network 24/7. So a true **ChatGPT without restrictions**—unlimited messages and full access to every feature—doesn't exist for free if you're not willing to pay. Still, the **free online generator** remains an incredibly generous offer.

**Looking ahead: What's next?**

Technology never stands still. ChatGPT already does more than just write text—it analyzes uploaded files, browses the web for up-to-date info (great for current news), generates images, and more. It's becoming truly multimodal, understanding different types of data.

It's safe to say that **free online artificial intelligence** will play an even bigger role in our lives. It'll evolve from a tool into an invisible but constant assistant, built into all our devices and services. Smart chatbots will help us learn, work, create, and even connect—making life a little easier and more interesting.

**Conclusion: Time to take action!**

We're living in an amazing era where tech that seemed like sci-fi yesterday is available to everyone today. **Free online ChatGPT** isn't just software. It's your new colleague, mentor, assistant, and idea generator. Don't be afraid to experiment, try different prompt styles, and use it for all kinds of tasks.

Forget the fear of blank pages and creative blocks. Now you have a powerful weapon—the **online ChatGPT generator**. Just open your browser, head to the site, and start chatting. Ask about whatever's on your mind, seek advice, or get help. You'll be amazed at how much a **smart free chatbot** can do. The world of artificial intelligence is open to you—step in right now!",1,1771096000.0,generatop,0,1.0,False

Maybe Im bit of shy and overthinker.
I’ve focused heavily on career and self-growth the last couple of years and somewhere along the way but, dating/social confidence didn’t get equal reps. I don’t drink, not into clubbing scenes, more of a gym,  spirituality, long walk, deep conversation type guy.
So this is me trying something different.

Happy to just chat here or over a call first. Meeting in person is optional and only if both of us feel comfortable — preferably in a public place.
Appreciate genuine effort over smooth talk

The ""only"" thing remaining is to reach the end of the solar system, and get promethium science pack. However, I have some issues, and I am not exactly sure how to solve them, so I'm coming here for some advice.

  
1) How to do legendary everything?

In another reddit thread I read that you pretty much need legendary stuff to go beyond the solar system's edge. I watched Melbourne w/o Coffee's videos (and I also have his blueprints), and I started doing the lds shuffle and holmium upcycling from supercapacitors. But my question is, is it really this painfully slow? I have a ship to gather legendary coal, but it's very slow. I have to add, that I have common quality productivity modules 3s for now, but it's still slow with some asteroid processing productivity. And of course, the blueprint uses some quality stuff, but I don't have those quality items in the first place. So what should I do? just gamble my way up to rare/epic quality? It seems to be just so slow and a waste of time to just wait for higher quality items. This is my biggest issue at the moment, because without several legendary machines, I don't think I will be able to get the promethium science pack.

2) Fulgora endgame base

For Fulgora, I was mainly following AVADII Strategy's advice, and I'm using a sushi belt and recycle the excess with priority to recycle the items that already took a loop. However, I'm at a point, where I think that one sushi belt is not enough, because I'm processing scrap a lot faster, than the belt throughput can handle (with turbo belt and belt stacking). I'm also trying to increase my holmium production, both because of the holmium upcycling and quantum processors. Should I move away from the sushi belt? What other base designs are a good option for Fulgora?

3) Gleba logistics

How should I transport things from Gleba, without half of them spoiling on the space platform? For the agricultural science pack, I have some circuit logic, that reads the orbital request of the rocket silo, and enables an inserter to insert the science packs if needed, which (kind of) seems to do the job. But my problem is that sometimes I'm not researching anything that uses the agricultural science pack, and then it just sits in my space platform just spoiling. To be fair I'm not that concerned about the agricultural science pack, because everything on Gleba is free and infinite, but I'm still wondering if there is a better way to do it.

Thank you for any help and advice. I also welcome advice for late game factorio in general.",2,1771095886.0,factorio,4,1.0,False

This is what I was surprised by as a Canadian lived in Europe for years as well. 

There are so many things I love about NZ that were *unexpected* (that is, beyond the obvious nature, etc.). Pleasant surprises:

* Service is top notch everywhere.
* People seem much happier than I'm used to, and more willing to chat with strangers than I'm used to.
* I love the no-tipping culture.
* The urgent care medical system (which I needed 3 times for 3 different issues!) is top notch. If you get injured in NZ, you pay what the locals pay ($100 to see a doc). If you have an illness, you pay foreign rate ($250).

Things I was surprised by and didn't like:

* The hotel rating system is absolute bullshit. A 5 star in NZ is a 3 star in North America. I stayed in all variety of hotels from 5-star to hostels, and there wasn't that much difference between them. Also the quality of hotel gyms varied extremely wildly
* They don't use cream for coffee, which was a big adjustment. Only milk? WTF NZ?? Also, their coffee cups are European sized (i.e. too small for us caffeine addicts!!)
* Everything will cost you twice what you anticipated, including getting around if you don't have a car. Taxis are horrendously expensive: 3x the price of an Uber in some cases.
* There are also surprise ""add ons"" that everywhere tries to upsell you. I spent $1500 for a helicopter ride to a glacier and Milford Sound and they tried to sell me a photo of me at the end for $25. Like, for that price just  include it??? Renting an e-bike? Get a hard as hell seat included, or they try to upsell you on a normal bike seat for another $10/day! etc.  All the upsell items are usually included elsewhere, and advertised prices are for the lesser quality, stripped-down versions of what you're probably used to. So bring extra cash.

Highlights:  
Pullman Auckland (CBD) has the best hotel gym I've ever seen. I could stay there forever and just work out. They even had ice baths, battle rope, and all kinds of unexpected things! Nice pool too.

Hilton Doubletree in Queenstown has beautiful bright rooms and amazing views.

Haka Hostel in Tekapo was surprisingly quiet.

Christchurch was unexpectedly cool and arty.

Lowlights:

Weather has sucked (in peak summer). So many plans got cancelled because of flooding,  heavy rain/storms, and the sewage spill in Wellington.

A lot of hotels are WAY too expensive for what they are.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Doctor Andrew Scheele, Senior Researcher at the UN-VR Cooperative Institute of Integrative Xenobiology***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: January 2nd, 2137*

“Oh. Hello,” I said, greeting Celso and Acetli as they walked in.

“Good paw,” Acetli responded. She went to her desk without another word.

“Hello!” Celso greeted, ears wiggling. “Making coffee?”

I replied, “Uhm. Yeah. Did you two walk in together?”

“Something like that.”

I wondered when the two met each other. I wondered a lot of things, but they… seemed to get along? At an immediate impression, at least. I shrugged. “Either of you want some coffee? I also brought in some cookies.”

Acetli silently flicked her ears in the negative, while Celso energetically replied, “Sure! I was actually hoping you were in here for coffee. I’ll have to see about the cookies.”

“I am occasionally convenient… I don’t think you’ve had any since that first time, right? Have a tired morning, maybe?”

“If anything, I’m feeling even more energized than usual today. I just thought coffee sounded good.”

“Fair enough,” I shrugged. I reached for some cups after setting the coffee machine.

“Oh, hey!” someone blurted. I turned to see Tanerik at the entrance to the room. His head tuft seemed poofier than usual. “A Yotul! Are you… Are you the plant guy? You look like the plant guy.”

Celso regarded the Venlil. “I might be *a* plant guy, but I’m far from *the* plant guy.”

“Just what a plant guy would say! Were you also the one that got in the taxi with the Thafki driver?”

“…Possibly?”

“Ha! I knew it!” Tanerik exclaimed. “She had such a deep voice, right? If you think *that* was deep, you should hear my cousin’s voice some time. You get that man alone in a car with his favorite song, your ears will be ringing in the best kind of way for the next claw. I think he drinks too many smoothies for his own good, though.”

“Smoothies claim yet another victim,” Celso solemnly replied. “You’ll have to introduce me some time.”

I looked to the others for assistance. Acetli looked even more confused than I was, somehow. Bemlin seemed able and willing to tone the whole conversation out.

Tanerik dumped his things by his desk. “Definitely. Are you here for Doctor Scheele’s coffee?”

“Among my ‘plant guy’ activities, yes.”

“You should try a mocha espresso some time. Though I should warn you, it’s not for everyone, including me probably, but that’s okay. If you ignore the jitters, it’s actually a pretty thrilling experience.”

The coffee finished. I poured the usual number of cups, plus an extra for Celso.

The Yotul poured an abundant amount of almond milk and a respectable amount of sugar into his beverage. Tanerik chose abundant for both.

“Well, I’ll catch you all later,” Celso said. “The bacteria need me.”

I reminded him to try a cookie later and waved goodbye. Celso seemed to be getting along, which was great, but I couldn’t help but think about that horrible documentary video that was burned into my memory.

I returned to my office and went through my email. I found a decently large human genome database for Rosim and sent it to him. I’m sure he’d find some issue with it, but at least I kept my promise.

That all got tiring quickly. I checked in with Acetli. She was making progress, although she seemed more distracted than usual. I didn’t bring it up so as to not put her on the spot, but kept a mental note for later. I couldn’t really blame her for being a little frazzled; computational genomics was an endless mountain of learning.

I checked in with Tanerik.

“Hey, how’s the work progressing?” I asked.

“It’s progressing! After that first bit of success, I upped the size of my dataset and everything broke.”

I snorted. “Yeah, that tends to happen. Remind me where you’re at, exactly? I know you were looking to see if the hidden genes were found in more than just a single sample genome.”

The Venlil flicked his ears in the affirmative. “So, hypothetically, the software you’ve been letting me use *should* count the number of times those genes pop up across the whole dataset, right?”

“The same one you were wanting to use earlier? I think so.”

“And assuming I were using it correctly, it wouldn’t spit out an error no matter how much I tried to troubleshoot?”

I put my hand to my chin. “Hm. Have you tried a different dataset to see how that fares? Or maybe cleaning it up? Some datasets can have a few odd things that need to be filtered out.”

His ears perked up at that. “Could it be the small sample size?”

I shrugged. “It might be a possibility. The dataset you were looking at, how many genomes does it have?”

“I think it was around ninety million. Or no, that was the other one I tried—this one’s closer to two-hundred million.”

“I—” I had to do a mental double take. “You said *million?*”

“Oh. That’s the problem, isn’t it?” Tanerik’s ears drooped. “It’s too small.”

My mouth hung open. “What— There’s a chance we can get open access to *hundreds of millions* of genomes?”

“Should I try to find a bigger one? I was only basing this on one of my previous projects. I know there’s plenty out there somewhere.”

“No. That’s… I’m in shock. That is a frankly unfathomable amount of data.”

“So it *isn’t* too small?”

I opened and closed my mouth. “It might be too *big*.”

“Too large? What is the average size of a human genome database?” asked Bemlin, peeking up from his computer.

“I don’t know. A few hundred thousand to a few million? *Maybe* more if your work *really* calls for it?”

“Why? Humanity has had whole-genome sequencing for many years. Has it not been exploited to its full potential?”

“Whoa, whoa.” I put a hand up. “Define ‘full potential’.”

Bemlin thought for a moment. “To begin, I would assume that nearly every newborn child is screened for potential disease and has their genome volunteered for public study?”

I considered the implications of that very loaded statement. “It’s incredibly common, but Earth is still a ways away from *every* newborn being screened. And only a small percentage volunteer their genomes for use in databases… mostly because people never bother with it once they turn into adults, but still.”

“Adulthood?” Tanerik said. “My parents put mine in a database the moment I was born. Finding my own genome was actually one of the projects in my genetics class a while ago! I extracted DNA from my mouth, sequenced it, and then looked it up on KeiVei-Lay. I think I wrote down my shorthand identifier somewhere…”

I cocked my head. Tanerik seemed awfully content with his genome—something that should be as private as one's diary—being put in a database without his consent. “Every person does that? As soon as they’re born?”

“Yep. Unless their parents are one of the more spiritual people. I met a guy like that once on the other side of the planet, owned a holopad repair store funnily enough.”

I nodded. “And you don’t see anything wrong with that?”

“…Owning a holopad repair store?”

“Your genome. Just having some of your most private info out in the open for anyone to look at?”

“Why would there be?” Bemlin added. “It is for the progress of science. And why would we want to conceal it? What is there to hide?”

I opened my mouth and shut it, trying to reconsider my position. Of course, there was the “prey do no harm” nonsense. I supposed with universal healthcare eliminating corporate incentives and the right personal protections, it wasn’t the *worst* idea… But it still irked me that seemingly none of the data was anonymized. It also explained why that guy was so disposed to asking for my hair.

Furthermore, it made me wonder about the Federation’s role in all this. It surely had some positive effects, but it’d be foolish to say they had nothing to gain from normalizing free access to *every person’s* genome… One more item on my soul-draining list of suspicions for KeiVei-Lay and the Federation as a whole.

I replied, “I’ll just say that on Earth, people are more protective of their DNA. Hardly anything makes it into a database without anonymization, and even then, lots of people never even bother—whatever their reasoning is.”

“But surely there’d be larger databases than what’s currently available?” said Bemlin. “Over a century of data, and only millions of genomes to show for it?”

“Well… a vast quantity was lost due to the satellite… stuff,” I said, opting to dodge a line of questioning about the satellite wars. Humanity’s self-destructive tendencies unfortunately mingled closely with science far too often. “But even then, Earth would never even compare to the wealth of data the Federation has. The *incomprehensible* amount of data on each and every species within it.”

Bemlin tapped a claw. “That explains Rosim’s and Hastum’s difficulties.”

I mumbled a response, more focused on the scale of xenogenomics. The database I sent him wouldn’t be enough for him. They wouldn’t be able to find anything close to what they were used to. *What do they do with all that information, anyways? Hundreds of years of genomic data from almost every individual… What could the Federation possibly use it for?*

*Hundreds of years of genomic data… What could we use all that information for?*

“So what should I do about the large datasets?” Tanerik asked, bringing me out of my haze.

I began to jot a few notes down. “I think I’m going to take a look at the software and see if I can’t resolve the issue myself. In the meantime, try maintaining a lower dataset size, to around a hundred thousand or so. See what happens.”

“Okay! Also, how and why would you anonymize a genome?”

“Carefully, and for privacy.”

I returned to my office.

I used AI to quickly sift through the code for any potential issues. I went through a few things it identified, one by one.

At first, I was worried about a possible integer overflow. If any one number was represented as a 64-bit integer when the program expected a 32-bit integer, I could imagine a few situations where it’d completely break when exposed to such large datasets.

Fortunately, the only big number trouble I had was much less foundational. It turned out that there were a few safeguards in place that guarded against outrageously massive database sizes, probably to keep undergrads from crashing their university’s server cluster. It’s only funny the first time.

I removed that pesky limitation. That ended up breaking a dozen other things that relied on the arbitrary number for completion percentages, time remaining estimates, and a mysterious few lines of code that didn’t *seem* useful, but I didn’t dare touch beyond changing an integer.

The whole process would’ve been an even larger ordeal had there been no documentation made publicly available on the original creator’s repository. Such openness would probably give the creators of KeiVei-Lay a heart attack.

I kept thinking about having access to *billions* of genomes, accumulated over hundreds of years. It clouded my brain, not because I couldn’t think of what to do with such potential, but because I couldn’t think of what *not* to do.

I made a note to touch on it during my upcoming presentation.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Acetli, Overwhelmed Geneticist***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: January 2nd, 2137*

It was hard to focus on work, even without Bemlin and Tanerik having their long and noisy conversations. Genomic datasets *this*, surprising outliers *that*.

I was soon able to compare my stream of thought to the human numeral, “8”. Or perhaps “0”. I’d come to recognize a few of them in all my digging through articles. I didn’t care to learn what they meant, but their circular shapes enticed me, which conveniently enough is how I realized I desperately needed a break.

I stretched and stared at the ceiling. I didn’t really help that much.

“Whoa, look at that group of outliers. That’s probably just some junk, right?” Tanerik said, right as I was finishing stretching my left arm.

“A group of a few dozen out of hundreds of thousands? Perhaps. What does the software say about them?”

“Let’s see. Uh, this one says it… doesn’t contain the hidden genes?”

I perked an ear up at that, though I remained listening from afar.

“Intriguing,” Bemlin said. “Check another.”

“Neither does this one… or this one… Do you think it’s some kind of error in the sequencing process for them?”

“I do not. At first appraisal, there is nothing else especially noteworthy in the genomes of these individuals. I am very curious…”

A moment passed. Tanerik said, “So what do you think?”

“These are only individuals that have *no* copies of the hidden genes. Are there any that have an allele for just a single copy, on one chromosome?”

“Maybe that’s this small-ish group right here?”

“Fascinating. A genotype where one allele is the *absence* of the gene’s sequence. On diploid chromosomes, in fact. How extraordinarily rare… I cannot say if I have ever seen one.”

“Yeah, that’s super weird. It’s not even loss of function or anything, the DNA sequence is just *gone*.”

“Simply gone…” Bemlin repeated.

“What would the different phenotypes even be?”

“I have a strong feeling that it would not be readily apparent. These hidden genes must not have a substantial impact on health, given they were never even identified.”

“This is definitely something Doctor Scheele would want to know, right?”

Bemlin hesitated, which seemed rare from him. “I would not disclose this to him yet. I wish to run a properly sized dataset for this before drawing conclusions, and that requires him to resolve the software's limitations.”

“*Don’t* tell him? I mean, sure, totally down for that… but why not?”

“I don’t mean to hold my reasons tightly to myself, but I believe I need more time to… organize my thoughts. Furthermore, he is occupied enough as it is. Trust that we will dig deeper into this.”

“Sounds good. I'll do that, right after I grab some more coffee.”

I spent the rest of my time not really working, and instead wondering what Bemlin could possibly be up to.

That, and nearly pulling my ears out because, despite being *pretty* sure that GenomIQ Lite was giving me very good numbers for the Krakotl genome, I still had no idea where those numbers were even coming from.

Tanerik left, and Bemlin followed not long after.

I would’ve stayed later to dig deeper into the unique functions the software defined to figure out exactly what was happening between my input and output, however I didn’t want to keep a certain Yotul late. I grabbed my things and stepped into the vacant hallway.

I peeked into a lab. Nothing was inside but a bunch of unopened storage totes in a dim, stiff space. Moving further in, the only light I saw was at the far end of the wing.

It felt strange walking through them all, as if I was intruding on conversations not meant for my ears. I wondered if the ones soon to populate the area would feel the same way, even if it was a silly thought that predators would assign emotion to inanimate objects.

I spotted Celso standing beside a microscope, a small stack of plates beside the device.

“I was wondering if you'd come find me,” he said with an amused wag of his tail.

“I was close to thinking that you'd left already.”

“I definitely thought about it.”

“Wow, so introspective of you,” I said with a roll of my ears. “So your backup plan is being in the middle of an experiment that's going to make you stay incredibly late?”

“Actually,” he said, exchanging plates on the microscope, “I'm just finishing this up. I was going to come find you.”

I regarded him. “Really?”

“You wanna see these calluses?” he asked.

“Your… what?”

He stepped aside, letting me get a proper view of the screen's feed. Roughly rectangular, mildly green shapes populated the field, segmented by darker outlines and, if I squinted, dozens of vague circular spots contained by them. Inside the plate being examined was something that looked like a tiny leaf, but had strange wrinkly masses beginning to form near the edges.

“They’ve been growing for several paws now. They’re looking pretty good, I think. It’s kind of surprising, actually; all the plants back home never looked like this the first time I cloned them. Always had to mess with the hormone balance a little before they looked this healthy. The media plates Andrew uses are great.”

“*That* thing looks healthy?”

“I mean, what it’s doing right now is technically a stress response, but it’s healthy enough.” He gestured to the microscope screen. “These are unorganized parenchyma cells, new growth. They’re very distinctive and recognizable, even for a plant from lightyears away. Earth plants are so bizarre; polyploidy, from what I can tell, is *much* more prevalent among plants there compared to Leirn or Venlil Prime.”

I tried to ignore the annoying nagging coming from a corner of my brain that told me those words didn’t fit coming from his mouth. “That’s, uh… You’re cloning Earth plants?”

“What else would I be doing all day?”

“Uh. Well…” I sputtered, desperately trying to find an answer that wouldn’t make me look bad. “I-I don’t know. I don’t do plant stuff.”

“I can tell by that sad plant in your living area,” he said, moving the plate to the stack.

“Rude. Also, I didn’t even ask for that thing, it just showed up one day.”

“Fair enough. Plants have a tendency to do that.” The Yotul turned off the microscope and picked up his stack of plates.

“So you were getting ready to leave just now?”

He walked over to a well-lit incubator and placed the plates inside. “Yeah, I just wanted to check on these real quick.”

“I don’t have to argue with you to come with me?”

“No… Unless you wanted to?”

I regarded him with suspicion. I was tempted to ask why he had such a sudden shift in attitude, but decided to drop the subject in fear that he’d actually start arguing. “I don’t. Which is good. It should be kept to a minimum.”

He flicked his ears as he flicked off the lights. We departed his work area and walked along the edge of the open laboratory space, passing by modules of workspaces and benches.

Unlit alcoves branched off every other row of benches, most occupied by the gentle hum of unused fume hoods. An occasional door led to a sterile tissue culture room, or a large, covered microscope of some kind, or, if the door was heavy and insulated, a large coldroom reserved for temperature-sensitive experiments.

We passed by a lit room, which would’ve been unremarkable if not for the brownish Venlil standing on a ladder, visible through the door’s window. He was digging into some kind of access panel between a tissue culture hood and an incubator. He flashed me a stare before we walked out of his sight.

“Who’s that?” I asked.

Celso shrugged his ears. “In my head I call him *Carno*. No idea his real name.”

“*Carno?*”

“It means brown… but more name-y. By my expert deduction skills, I’d hazard to say he’s some kind of maintenance guy. I’ve seen him a few times before, he only ever acknowledges me with a grunt. If I’d known he grunted so much I would’ve thought of another name.”

“…Alright then.”

“What do you think they’re going to do with all this space?” Celso asked.

“Well, if you want *my* ‘expert deduction skills’, I think they’re going to fill it with humans,” I said, passing by an unplugged freezer. “Who knows what’ll happen after that.”

“I was more wondering about the kind of research they’ll be doing. I translated the shipping details on some of the boxes.” He tapped on one of the larger totes we passed by. “That one’s an immunoassay analyzer, the second one I’ve seen. Pretty sure it automatically screens for all sorts of proteins and signaling molecules, I wonder what the library size on it is.”

“How did you figure that out?”

“Slowly. I had some downtime so I painstakingly used the lab computer to decipher whatever was on the shipping labels.”

“Hm. Well I’m not sure I even really *want* to think about all the kinds of research humans are going to be doing once they get here. All this AI stuff has me overwhelmed enough as it is.”

He held the door for me as we exited the lab space. “You’re working with AI? Like, the ones made by humans?”

“To my immense interest and deep chagrin, yes.”

“As research tends to be. Which side is winning at the moment?”

“I don’t know. I’m learning how to use these AI-driven pieces of software for all this genomic analysis, but there’s so much to them that I still have no clue about. There’s all this math and multidimensional… *stuff* going on, and I’m still here trying to figure out what the heck a ‘tensor’ is. Or a ‘Bayesian measure of uncertainty’. Like, what?”

Celso blinked. “Who is Bayes and why are they uncertain?”

“I have no idea!” I exclaimed, pushing the button for the elevator. “It’s all so complicated for no reason. Humans and their *names*.”

“It’s bold to accuse humanity of having odd naming conventions while we’re on *this* planet.”

I scoffed, “Oh? Like what?”

“This planet’s method of timekeeping aside, I don’t even know where to begin. There’s at least eight different flowers that have the complete wrong color in their name. There’s parks named after stars that are named after people that are named after other stars. There’s a whole species of plant that’s named after a *shadow*. Not the object itself, but the *shadow it casts*.”

I was offended. “We’ve actually had time to develop our culture, it makes sense if you actually look into things… most of the time. It probably only seems strange to someone from Leirn.”

“Believe it or not, I *did* look into things. Before I moved here, in fact!” Celso wiggled his ears. “But, you know. It’d probably seem strange to someone from Leirn regardless of any Venlil’s sophisticated opinion.”

I squinted, as though it would help me parse that. “Was that sarcasm?”

“It was quite sincere.”

My squint intensified. “Then what do you mean by that?”

He pushed the button for the first floor after we stepped on. “Oh, nothing, I was just poking fun about names. I’m sure every language has all sorts of weird stuff going on.”

“That’s not what I was— Whatever,” I sighed. “You do that on purpose.”

The Yotul cocked a falsely innocent ear.

“I won’t pry into your reasoning since I know it doesn’t work, but a quick ‘I’d rather drop this subject’ would be so much simpler.”

The elevator gave us a polite *ding*, and Celso stepped out first. “It’d also be simpler to just stop talking, but where’s the fun in that? And to your point, what would there even be to blame you for?”

“So I’m supposed to imagine you’re doing the conversation a favor?”

“You don’t even have to imagine!” he said with a wiggle to his ears. “On the topic of imagining things, those receptionists look miserable, right? It’s not just me?”

I glanced over, deciding to entertain him for a moment. “They are usually grumpy looking, but I’d like to give them the benefit of the doubt.”

Celso happily waved his tail. “That’s hopeful, but I think you’ve got the right idea.”

1r4stsw,https://i.redd.it/yhekcwxlcijg1.jpeg,Aeropress cortado,"I've been experimenting with the aeropress for about a week now, finally dialed in a recipe I like. My doctors took caffeine away from me some years back. I kept drinking decaf because I like my morning coffee ritual, but I got tired of drinking bad decaf coffee, and it turns out there really is life after caffeine.  

20 g of medium dark roast, the Decaf Equator Blend from Equator Coffee. Cheap chinesium hand grinder off Amazon, set at the coarsest end of the setting range they recommend for aeropress. It actually appears to do a reasonably good job, visually the grind size is pretty damn consistent. 

Fellow Prismo attachment with a filter paper,  coffee shaken and tapped to level it, and then another filter paper pushed down on top of it with the bottom end of a spice jar that just barely fits inside the aeropress.  I wet the filter to stick it to the bottom of the spice jar, press it tight and release, and then press it again lightly and twist a little bit to release the jar from the filter paper. It leaves the filter paper laid snugly across the top of the lightly compressed coffee. 

130 g of 183° F water, pressed until a few drops come out to wet the coffee, let sit for 30 seconds, and then press it out over 40-50 seconds until it starts hissing. It's a hard press. 

I tried 200° F - boiling temp water, and there was too much bitterness for my taste. 

120 g of milk, heated to 145-150° f, frothed with a little one cup size french press.  I'm actually using evaporated milk mixed 2:1 with water, which gives a rich flavor I like.  

I've also had this black, and I like it. Rich, very little bitterness, lots of flavor. I'm quite pleased with the aeropress so far. 

I have a Joepresso coming with the non-pressurized basket, to see if the same recipe works well with that, with less of a hassle of creating the filter paper sandwich. ",14,1771095628.0,AeroPress,2,1.0,False

Usually we’d only bump into each other once in a blue moon and have coffee for an hour or two; but since I’m here for a longer stretch this time, he said we could plan little trips or activities together if I fancied doing something in the area with him.

Last week he even said he’d supposedly got me a birthday present. My birthday’s on the 15th of February, and I’m heading back to the city I study/work in that day anyway. And since I'm not so keen on birthdays at all, I suggested we could do something low-key on the 14th instead; maybe a little day trip, somewhere historical, or by a lake, just a day plan that could take our mind off things. He said yeah, sure.

Then… I got nothing. I waited three/four days for him to actually confirm anything. Yesterday I messaged him twice, both times just left on read. Meanwhile, he somehow had the time to sit on a ten-hour voice call with some random girl he met on Discord. I mean, you don't treat a longterm friend just because you've met this girl who's got the potential to be your next date!?

It was also the sunniest day since I got here, and I ended up staying in feeling a bit rubbish. partly because of him, partly because I’m still not fully over a breakup from two months ago. He knows it was a painful one. Yet the moment there’s even the slightest chance he could flirt with or potentially meet some girl, his whole energy towards me shifts, I've noticed.

Thought I’d share the breakdown because the effective savings surprised even me.

# 🧾 What I ordered

* Tall Cold Coffee – ₹305
* Chocolate Truffle Pastry – ₹390

**Total bill: ₹730 (including taxes)**

Important: They mentioned that to pay via District, at least one food item was mandatory. Coffee alone wouldn’t qualify.

# 💸 How the stacking worked

**1) 25% off via District (Valentine's offer)**

→ ₹182.5 discount

**2) District Pass benefit**

→ ₹250 additional discount

New subtotal: ₹297.5

* ₹20 convenience fee = ₹317.5

**3) ₹75 cashback received later**

Effective amount: ₹242.5

**4) Paid using Slice Credit Card**

District Spark offer triggered

→ ₹95.25 instant cashback

# 🎯 Final effective spend

₹730 → ₹147.25

That’s roughly 80% effective savings just by stacking:

* Platform discount
* Pass benefit
* Cashback
* Card-level offer

Sometimes it’s not about having a premium card.

It’s about knowing how to combine offers properly.

Curious if anyone else here actively stacks offers like this?

Maybe Im bit of shy and overthinker.
I’ve focused heavily on career and self-growth the last couple of years and somewhere along the way but, dating/social confidence didn’t get equal reps. I don’t drink, not into clubbing scenes, more of a gym,  spirituality, long walk, deep conversation type guy.
So this is me trying something different.
I just want to fix my flaws which I obviously know but cant fix em alone need someone to spot me so that i can correct em.

If there are any women from Mumbai here who:

Happy to just chat here or over a call first. Meeting in person is optional and only if both of us feel comfortable — preferably in a public place.
Appreciate genuine effort over smooth talk
I Prefer public, safe, no-pressure meetups (coffee, walk near ur location (I stay near vikhroli/powai)
Are also tired of low-effort dating culture
I’d actually love advice — or even a conversation.
No rush, no expectations. Just two normal humans meeting in a public place and seeing if conversation flows.

You know, the side hustle idea, learning that new skill, finally writing that book. I’m fed up with the usual ""just hustle harder"" or ""wake up at 4 AM every day"" advice. It just leads to burnout, shame spirals, and elaborate Notion setups I abandon after a week.

My latest experiment wasn't about maximizing every minute or optimizing my sleep cycles with an expensive gadget. It was about something much simpler: finding a way to make steady, *unsexy* progress on **one** personal project, day in and day out, without feeling like I was sacrificing my sanity or becoming a productivity robot.

For years, I fell into the same traps:

*   **The ""Perfect System"" Trap:** I'd spend more time researching and building elaborate planners, task managers, and tracking spreadsheets than actually doing the work. The goal became the system itself.
*   **""Batching Everything"" Fallacy:** I tried to dedicate huge, multi-hour blocks of time on weekends or evenings. But life inevitably intervened – social plans, unexpected errands, just plain exhaustion – leading to missed sessions, guilt, and eventually, giving up on the project entirely.
*   **""Just Grind It Out"" Burnout:** Forcing myself to work when I wasn't motivated quickly led to resentment and mental fatigue. My projects felt like chores, not passions.

### My Latest Experiment: The ""Tiny Wins, Non-Negotiable Slot""

This wasn't a complex methodology. It was a stripped-down approach, blending elements of atomic habits with simple time blocking, focused on consistency over intensity.

**Here’s what I did:**

1.  **Identified THE ONE Task:** I picked *one* crucial, non-urgent task related to my personal project (in my case, finishing the first draft of a short ebook). My daily goal wasn't ""write for an hour,"" but ""write one paragraph"" or ""edit one page."" The bar was intentionally set absurdly low.
2.  **The Non-Negotiable Slot:** I blocked out a **minimum of 15 minutes** every weekday morning, right after my coffee and before I checked emails or started any work tasks. This slot was non-negotiable, like brushing my teeth. It went into my digital calendar (Google Calendar) as a recurring event.
3.  **Minimalist Tooling:** No fancy apps. I simply used a plain text file for my writing, or whatever native tool was required for the task. The focus was on *doing*, not managing.
4.  **Low-Stakes Accountability:** I linked up with a friend who also had a personal project. We didn't do deep check-ins or progress reports. We just sent a quick ""Done today!"" text message to each other after our respective slots. The simple act of having to report *something* was surprisingly effective.

**Measurable Progress & The Messy Middle:**

*   **Consistency:** I maintained this daily ""tiny win"" for **112 consecutive weekdays**. The streak became a quiet motivator. Missing a day felt worse than doing just 5 minutes of the task.
*   **Tangible Output:** Over those 112 days, I finished the first draft of that short ebook—roughly 20,000 words. This project had been stuck in various ""systems"" for over a year. The progress felt slow on any given day, but cumulative, it was profound.
*   **Mental Shift:** The constant hum of guilt about ""not working on my project"" almost entirely disappeared. It was replaced by a quiet sense of steady accomplishment. Decision fatigue around what to work on evaporated; the decision was already made.

**The Messy Bits & Adjustments:**

*   **The First Two Weeks Were Rough:** My snooze button was a formidable opponent. Some days, I barely managed 5 minutes before rushing into work. I often felt like a failure because I didn't hit the full 15 minutes.
*   **Adjusting the ""Minimum"":** I had to mentally reset. If I only got 5 minutes in, it still counted as a win. The point was to *show up*, not to achieve peak performance every single time. This adjustment was critical for keeping the streak alive on high-stress days.
*   **Travel Almost Broke Me:** Maintaining the habit while traveling was the hardest part. I had to get creative – working on my phone in an airport lounge, jotting notes in a hotel lobby. My accountability partner's ""Did you get it done?"" text was often the only thing that pushed me through.

**Realistic Expectations & Limitations:**

*   **Requires Upfront Clarity:** You need to genuinely decide on *one* crucial, non-urgent task. Picking too many or switching frequently will derail you.
*   **A Consistent Slot is Key:** Find a time that genuinely works for you and protect it. Mine was mornings; yours might be during lunch or late evenings.
*   **Accountability is a Force Multiplier:** Even a super light accountability system makes a huge difference.
*   **Results are Cumulative:** This isn't a ""get rich quick"" scheme for your goals. It’s about building momentum, one tiny win at a time. Don't expect a sudden burst of progress; expect quiet, relentless forward motion.

# Nothing anything like so straightforward.

# ""I did,"" said Ford. ""It is.""

# ""So,"" said Arthur, hoping he wasn't sounding ridiculously obtuse, ""why don't people get rid of the lizards?""

# ""It honestly doesn't occur to them,"" said Ford. 

# ""They've all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they've voted in more or less approximates to the government they want.""  (Ford)

# ""You mean they actually vote for the lizards?""  (Arthur)



# ""Oh yes,"" said Ford with a shrug, ""of course.""

# ""But,"" said Arthur, going for the big one again, ""why?""

# ""Because if they didn't vote for a lizard,"" said Ford, ""the wrong lizard might get in. 

# Got any gin?"" (Ford)



# ""What?""  (Arthur)



# ""I said,"" said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice, ""have you got any gin?""



# ""I'll look. Tell me about the lizards.""  (Arthur)



# Ford shrugged again.

# ""Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them,"" he said. ""They're completely wrong of course, completely and utterly wrong, but someone's got to say it.""

  


# ""But that's terrible,"" said Arthur.

# ""Listen, bud,"" said Ford, ""if I had one Altairian dollar for every time I heard one bit of the Universe look at another bit of the Universe and say 'That's terrible' I wouldn't be sitting here like a lemon looking for a gin.”

If you've been hesitant about threading because of the pain or potential redness, here’s a summary of the benefits and how to prep, based on the standards from Threading Diva ,Fort Lauderdale.

**Why Threading?**

• **Precision:** It pulls individual hairs from the follicle for a cleaner arch than waxing.

• **No Hyperpigmentation:** No heat or tugging means less trauma to melanin-rich skin.

• **Better Regrowth:** Hair grows back softer and tapered over time.

**How to Prep:**

1. **Stop Tweezing:** You need about two weeks of growth (1/8 inch).

2. **Hydrate:** Drink water, but skip the coffee (caffeine can make nerve endings jumpy).

3. **Aftercare:** Avoid heavy makeup for 24 hours. Use Aloe Vera or Rose Water to soothe any minor redness.

My husband (35) and I have been to our share of baby showers, as gusts and as co-hosts. 

And I have an opinion. 

We would rather have what we need instead of things we would end up returning and/or exchanging. 

Babies cost money. And baby showers should support the parents the way they need to be supported, not by societal standards of Big Baby and social media influence of products. 

I am wanting to do raffles: diaper raffle, wipes raffle, gift cards earmarked for formula raffle, 50/50 raffle where funds go to medical expenses (mom&baby) and baby's education account. 

and Games: how many candies in the jar, guess moms belly size with string, corn hole tournament, guess babies attributes, etc.

They will come with prizes. A TV ($200-$350 Roku TV) for the diaper raffle prize, and various gift baskets, about $50-75 value each, for everything else: Coffee Basket (mugs, coffee, etc), Wine Basket (wine glasses, wine, etc), Moms Cravings (random snacks+ candies), Spa Basket (bath bomb, face/eye/lip masks, etc). 

I don't want a million outfits that the baby will have outgrown before I can even have an occasion to put the baby in it. Outfits are notorious non-registry gifts that appear at baby showers. I don't want the crib that the baby won't sleep in for a year, as baby does not have a nursery/own room, yet. I just don't have the space for extra baby things that baby won't need for a while. 

I do plan on having a registry for those that do not wish to participate in the prize games. it has books, bedside bassinet, pump, small baby bath items, moms afterbirth care products, etc

This information, the registry, the games, and prizes, will be listed on the invitations.

Before you come for me, I know my crowd. Casino goers and sports betters. This won't offend them. And it shouldn't offend you either.

Currently I'm in my last year of my Bachelor's degree and I have high hopes of pursuing a PhD in the future. A tough road, I know, but science has always been and will be my passion. I've been through a lot these years, I've changed so much that I'm impressed with myself. I've started to adopt a better mindset, tried my best to focus on the positive and forget the negative, as much as possible.

I've always loved my family a ton. I'm the type of person that shows their feelings in a particular way, but I've always tried my best to make that clear. I haven't done anything wrong to offend them, and when I made mistakes I acknowledged and mended them. But, as life is starting to get more and more real and with that more and more stressful, I lack the support I actually need. 

My mother has always been here for me, in her own often toxic way. I don't hate her and I don't want to ever feel that towards her, but I can't help building a small ounce of resentment in my heart. Every time I'm home she makes it sure to start a fight. She's not happy with whatever I'm doing, and even if something went well, she only says ""Good"" and then proceeds to drown me in her troubles. I always listen, I know it's hard for her, but she's pushing all of it onto me, as if it's my fault or mine to solve. I can't talk to her about my emotions or worries for the future, since she will just say she has bigger problems and I should not mind my thoughts, just ignore them and they'll go away.

She's making a huge deal out of everything I'm doing, why am I silent, why am I not only sitting with her, why am I talking with my friends when I'm home, why am I so busy and not spending time with her. Her negative energy is pressing me down so much that when I'm home I can't get one thing done, I have to work on my thesis this week and she's absolutely bonkers that I have to do a single thing. I would love to spend time with her, watch a movie together, enjoy something - but when I'm with her she always starts the same old discourse that I despise and also the main reason of this post. 

That discourse is basically her comparing me to child me. Mind you, around 8 years old me. More than a decade ago young me. She doesn't understand why I'm not as happy as I was many years ago, why am I not constantly telling her that I love her, why am I not writing her love letters anymore. Mind you, I wrote those letters because she used to get so mad she would barely speak with me, and as a kid I was absolutely terrified since no one would look after me, I literally wrote her in one of those that I'd rather off myself than make her upset. When I read that with my mentality now I almost cried, she was treating me so badly and now she's proudly showing me these things I've written as if it's pure fluff and snuggles. 

I used to be fat because of my hormones going haywire and she was laughing about it all the time. She used to call me names and mock me at any chance. I now have the scars of that time (a broken self-esteem, body image issues, stretch marks), and have gone through a lot of work with myself to get into an acceptable body shape. She commented today on my weight loss and said so many nasty, nasty things about the time when I was fat, calling me a distorted monster, disfigured even. She noticed all those things back then, saw how hurt I was and how badly it affected everything about me, but instead of helping me, she was mocking me and still does, even if I worked *so hard* to slim down. 

I started smoking, not a good habit to pick up I know, and she's telling me every time that *when I was a kid, I would say this and that about smoking*.... Man, it's tiring. It's not these things that bring me down. It's the fact that she does this *every, damn, conversation*, and she asks me to comment on them. She asks me what do I think, and if I don't answer her, she gets oddly mad and doesn't speak with me for days since ""I obviously hate her and don't want to talk with her"". 

I'm still fighting with depression, not as bad as before, but it has its ups and downs. I have days of rotting in bed and crying, and days when I'm pushing through and doing my work. I've met wonderful people, made memories, found my passion and connected with researchers I wouldn't have even dreamed of meeting. I plan on working hard, publishing articles, speaking at Conferences, doing something in the field that I'm passionate about. Nothing much, nothing revolutionary, but enough for my broken soul. 

So it hurts, it *hurts* so much that she's the one crying that I hate her, when all she does is bash me. I know that one day I'll complete a big achievement and she won't even care. I know that I can't share with her anything about my friendships, my love interests, my struggles, because all she sees is child me, that was constantly with her and never talked back. I love her, she's not overall a bad mother, she's worked very hard and offered me the best she could. But emotionally speaking, I can't find my way to reach her.

I don't know if she even knows a correct things about me, since she's still not seeing me for myself, for my *present* self. She assumes I like warm weather, I don't. She forces me all the time to go on random holidays with her when I have so many projects to work on and then says I don't want to spend time with her. When she says wrong things that are in my area of study and I try to correct her, she says I don't know better than her. I only get mad at these things because she's hurting herself, she believes all the bullshit she sees on the internet and doesn't listen to me in the slightest. Sometimes she tries to force specific clothing and hairstyles on me, because when I was young I would wear those. 

I'm so conflicted right now, I don't know how to see this situation, because any action of mine is just another offense to her. I know I'm not perfect, I know I'm mean and dealing with a lot of issues, but I don't think I'm all that bad. I've started earning some money on my own, constantly getting scholarships, she only helps me with rent and sometimes pocket money if it gets bad. I don't want to go no contact, I want her present in my life, I want her close, I miss her when I'm away for too long, but all these feelings go away when she's being like this. I feel like I'm reverting to my teen self when I'm back home, depressed, isolated, alone, shivering when there's movement in the house. 

I'm stressed out of my mind, I'd rather take exams back to back than this. I can't even look her in the face, I don't know if I can draw her from my memory. It triggers something in me, her gaze makes me feel judged. I thought once I'll get older I'll see her from another perspective, I'll be able to resonate with her, maybe I was really just an edgy kid and that was it. It was never a phase, I feel absolute terror when I make my coffee in the morning, because I know I'm going to do something to upset her. I had health issues, I couldn't tell her since she doesn't ""believe"" in medicine, in doctors, anything around that. And it sucks, as a young woman, not having a mother by your side to guide you through some things. I'm forever thankful for my understanding friends that have been my pillar of support through all my hardships just so I can call my mom and say that everything is fine, even if I was falling apart. I don't tell her just so she doesn't worries, I don't tell her so she doesn't start yelling at me. 

I also feel like some kind of dead weight to my family, my sister is much older than me and is doing well, I'm happy for her and I have a close relationship with her. Now that she's at a stable point in her life my mother feels very proud of her and makes comments that feel so backhanded ""Your sister is well off, I wish I could take a break from everything, but I still... have you"". I don't know how I'm going to get where I wish to get with all this pressure on my back. One mistake and it'll haunt me forever, I can't possibly fail because, even if there's support for me, it will come with a huge price. 

I know I rambled a lot, but it feels better to get this off my chest, no pun intended haha. I also know I shouldn't take her words to heart, but she's my mother, I care about her, so somewhere in my heart I'm still looking for her approval, for her praise. I'm proud of myself for changing and becoming a little better version of myself, but it gets hard to keep that mindset when she's walking all over it. I hope that one day we'll be able to see eye to eye, and that she'll see me for the actual me.

Not looming. Not reaching. Just standing there, angled slightly, like someone was told to wait and didn’t know how.

It was too tall for the space. Its head bent at an uncomfortable angle to avoid the ceiling. One shoulder pressed into the wall. The other hung loose, uncertain.

I stared at it longer than I should have.

It didn’t move. That was the part that kept me calm.

When I blinked and looked away, it was gone.

I didn’t tell anyone. Who would listen? Hallway lighting is bad at night. Corners play tricks. Fatigue is good at inventing people.

The next night, I found it standing in the doorway to my bathroom.

This time, it fit better.

Its head no longer scraped the ceiling. Its shoulders weren’t jammed against the frame. It stood just inside the threshold, blocking the light, its posture still wrong but improved. Less folded. Less cramped.

I watched it for a long time.

It didn’t breathe. It didn’t sway. It didn’t react to being seen. It simply occupied the space.

I backed away and turned on the hallway light.

When I looked back, the doorway was empty.

That was when I realized something I wish I hadn’t.

It wasn’t appearing randomly. It was choosing places where a person might stand.

Over the next few nights, it showed up in increasingly sensible locations.

At the end of the stairs.

Halfway down the living room wall.

Behind the couch, where someone might linger during a conversation without sitting.

Each time, its posture improved.

Its head straightened. Its shoulders squared. Its feet aligned more evenly beneath it. The angles softened. The strain eased.

It was learning how to hold itself.

It never moved while I was looking at it. The moment my attention slipped, even briefly, it would relocate.

I tested this without meaning to.

One night, it stood beside the refrigerator, facing the wall at an awkward angle. I stared until my eyes watered. When I finally turned to grab my phone, I heard nothing. No footsteps. No shifting weight.

When I looked back, it was gone.

I found it moments later standing at the kitchen counter, positioned exactly where I usually stood to make coffee.

After that, I started mapping my apartment in my head. Which corners were too narrow. Which doorframes were too low. Which places it hadn’t used yet. I stopped leaving rooms without scanning first. I stopped turning off lights.

Sleep became difficult. I kept expecting to wake up and find it standing at the foot of my bed, but it didn’t.

Not yet.

Instead, it began using spaces that suggested intention.

The hallway, but centered now.

The living room, facing outward instead of into a wall.

The entryway, positioned as if waiting for someone to arrive.

It no longer pressed into surfaces.

It stood freely.

I tried to leave for a few days, but the feeling followed me. Every hotel room felt wrong. Every corner too open. I kept imagining it standing just outside my field of view, correcting itself in my absence.

When I returned home, I knew immediately that something had changed.

The apartment felt used.

Not disturbed. Not damaged. Occupied.

A chair had been nudged slightly out of place. The bathroom mirror was tilted down a fraction. My shoes were aligned more evenly than I remembered leaving them.

I found it standing in the middle of my living room.

Fully upright.

Perfectly balanced.

Its posture was correct now. No tilt. No compression. No visible strain. If you saw it in passing, you might assume it belonged there. A person waiting. A person thinking. A person about to speak.

I stood frozen in the doorway and watched.

It didn’t look at me.

It didn’t need to.

That night, I slept on the couch with the lights on. I must have drifted off at some point, because I woke to silence and the unmistakable sense of presence.

It stood beside the couch.

Not crowding.

Not close enough to touch.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. I stared at the ceiling and waited for something to happen.

By morning, it had left the apartment that was no longer mine.

I began avoiding certain areas. Standing only where I had to. Sitting carefully. Leaving space unoccupied without meaning to. The places it hadn’t tried yet began to feel like a dwindling list.

It appeared for the last time in my bedroom doorway.

Standing exactly where I would stand if I were about to leave.

Perfect posture. Correct height. Correct orientation.

I knew then what was wrong.

There was nowhere else for it to improve.

And there was nowhere else for me to go that it hadn’t already learned.

I left the apartment that night.

I haven’t gone back.

Sometimes, in public places, I notice someone standing oddly still. Not moving. Not interacting. Just occupying space too carefully.

I don’t stare long enough to be sure.

As one of Gerstlauer’s finest creations, Flucht von Novgorod (FVN) is a coaster where the experience begins long before the train dispatches. From the queue to the exit, the theming is meticulous.

Nearly half of the 700+ meter layout is indoors, which means POV videos online don’t really capture its true character. Because of that, my expectations were a little low. And that’s exactly why it shocked me so much. In terms of information density — every meter of track, every element, every thematic moment — no other coaster could pack as much into the same distance.

The Queue & Atmosphere

Even in the outdoor queue, you can sense something unusual. To the right is the launch section — hidden beneath a low, semi-underground concrete structure covered with golden leaves. Pipes and cables protrude from it, almost like a buried industrial tomb. You can’t see the launch, only hear distant screams erupting from underground before an eight-seat mini train suddenly bursts out and climbs into the sidewinder.

Inside the castle, the queue becomes dark and winding. There’s even a miniature guillotine prop embedded in the wall — stick your hand under it and the blade drops. It won’t hurt you, obviously, but it’s just unsettling enough. German kids were lining up to test their courage.

The station is incredibly claustrophobic. The train is tiny — just two rows, eight riders total. Before dispatch, a door blocks the front while the rear disappears into darkness. A chandelier with candle-like bulbs hangs above. It feels less like a coaster station and more like a medieval cellar. The tight, damp atmosphere perfectly fits the “escape” theme.

The First Launch

The front gate opens. The train rolls into complete darkness.

A ghost appears in a window, speaking German I can’t understand. A fire mage materializes ahead. And then—

Without warning, the train dives right and slams into an extremely forceful LSM launch. The acceleration is violent. The back push is aggressive and immediate. This launch is so intense that it even surpasses the hydraulic launch of Desert Race at Heide Park.

At the end of the launch, the train whips right at full speed, blasting out of the building into daylight with heavy positive Gs and strong lateral forces.

Then comes one of the most outrageous airtime moments I’ve experienced — a sharply profiled hill that throws you upward aggressively. Even with the OTSR restraints, it’s wild.

This sequence — launch + first hill — is one of the two best moments of the ride.

Outdoor Section

The sidewinder mainly serves as a turnaround. The heartline roll gives decent hangtime, though the over-the-shoulder restraints limit upper-body freedom a bit. Then comes a quick brake run before re-entering the building.

The Vertical Lift & 97° Drop

The second half begins immediately.

The doors slam shut behind you. Darkness again.

This is where Gerstlauer’s Euro-Fighter DNA shows: a vertical lift hill inside a lightning-filled tower. A ghost waves a scythe at riders while thunder and flashing lights simulate a storm. Brief flashes illuminate the ancient brick walls and track disappearing upward into darkness.

Before you fully realize it, you’re at the top.

And then—

The 97-degree drop.

Numerically, 97° doesn’t sound insane. The airtime itself isn’t world-class. But the psychological effect is enormous. You can’t see the drop. You don’t know where you are. The transition from vertical lift to beyond-vertical plunge happens almost without warning. The combination of darkness, unknown, and abrupt angle changes makes the drop feel much more intense.

After a fast left dive and straight brake section, there’s one final scare: looking up toward the ceiling, a ghost suddenly lunges downward.

And just like that, it’s over.

The Exit Maze

The experience doesn’t end at the brake run.

Instead of immediately entering a gift shop, you’re sent into a small maze. One path is a dead end. One loops back to the start. Only the middle path leads to the exit — and it requires ducking through a low, broken-looking doorway.

After a ride like that, still slightly shaken, it’s surprisingly stressful.

Finally, sunlight. The real exit shop. I bought a €3.50 coffee and sat outside to decompress.

Final Thoughts

FVN is unforgettable.

In terms of pure ride experience and information density per meter, no matter how long other coasters are, taking just 700 meters of them wouldn’t match what FVN packs into its layout. Every second counts — every element delivers.

I wrote this less than 24 hours after riding it. The memory is still vivid. I would gladly travel back to Hansa Park just for this coaster.

As for the storyline and German dialogue — I’ll have to revisit that when I actually understand the language.",3,1771094657.0,rollercoasters,2,1.0,False

I also wonder if people even read stuff like this anymore.  I feel like everyone is busy and perhaps just getting to the point is better.  Right now I am thinking of doing some of both.

As small business owners yourselves, is this content you'd actually read or is it just too long and doesn't get to the point fast enough?

This is more of a longer, narrative piece about how food gets classified for sales tax purposes. I know it's long. I'm curious whether you'd actually finish it or bounce partway through, and if so, where.

My ten-year-old would eat ketchup packets for every meal if we let him. Not ketchup on something. The packets. The little Heinz ones from the takeout bag that he hoards in his jacket pockets like a condiment squirrel.



To him, this is fine dining.



He's one of the good eaters in our house.



I have four kids. Two of them will sit down and eat what's in front of them. The other two would like to discuss their options. They'll eat some fruits, some vegetables, enough that nobody's calling a doctor. But an actual plate of food, served at an actual table, at the time widely understood to be dinner? That's optimistic.



I'm famous in my fantasy football leagues for making trades. My whole strategy is finding the win-win. Both sides walk away feeling good. I get more reps at this than anyone in my league realizes.



""Dad, I want a protein bar.""



Only if you eat some carrots and pepper slices first.



""Hmm. Just one?""



Both.



""Okay, well then what's my dessert?""



Twelve of these a day. Four kids, three meals, every one a trade.



Everyone's definition of food is different. That's fine. That's genuinely how it should be. We all like different things, we all need different things, and four kids at one table means four completely reasonable sets of preferences about what counts as dinner. Nobody's wrong. I'd never tell my kid what he wants to eat isn't real food.



It's real food. It's just not my definition.



My wife and I love cooking for our kids. We do. But four different breakfasts, four different lunches, and four different dinners every day is driving us both insane. Not because anyone is being unreasonable. Because serving four reasonable definitions at the same time is a completely different problem than understanding any one of them.



All we want to do is make a meal and sit down and eat with our kids. Instead we're making twelve.



I think about this a lot. Because it turns out this is also how sales tax works in America.



There are roughly 13,000 tax jurisdictions in the United States. Each one has a perfectly reasonable definition of what counts as food. And just like my kids, every single one of them makes sense on its own terms.



In Pennsylvania, a pumpkin is a grocery item. [Tax-exempt](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/pennsylvania/61-Pa-Code-SS-60-7). That tracks. Food is food. Unless you're planning to carve it, in which case it's a decorative item, and the [state would like its eight cents](https://www.pacodeandbulletin.gov/Display/pabull?file=/secure/pabulletin/data/vol49/49-24/909.html) please and thank you. That also tracks. A jack-o-lantern isn't dinner. Same pumpkin. Same farm stand. Same guy handing it to you. Two perfectly reasonable readings, depending on what you do with it after you leave.



The state needs to know your plans for the pumpkin. Maybe there's a form required every time you buy one.  
Decorative.   
Edible.   
Undetermined.   
  
Maybe we should just call Palantir?  
  


In New York, a bagel becomes taxable when a knife touches it. Slicing is preparation. The knife is the tax event. In Pennsylvania, a whole pumpkin becomes taxable when a knife touches it. Carving is decoration. The knife is also the tax event.



Same knife. Two different foods. Completely opposite reasons.



One gets taxed because the knife made it more like a meal. The other gets taxed because the knife made it less like food. A spoon, for the record, would have kept the pumpkin exempt. Scoop the insides out for pie and you're fine.



The spoon is tax-neutral. The knife is not.    
  
Simple.



Though if you use that spoon to put that pumpkin in a latte, you're taxable again. Started the morning as a grocery item. Became a decoration when someone picked up a knife. Food again when they grabbed a spoon. A taxable beverage by the time it hit their coffee. Four reclassifications before noon. Same pumpkin.  
  
This is known as sales tax, I think.

I called a state department once with a food classification question. The employee who picked up was patient. Helpful. She pulled up the statute, put me on hold for a minute. I could hear typing. She came back and said it depends on what the customer plans to do with it.



We both just sat there for a second. She knew. I knew. That wasn't really an answer. But it was the only accurate one.



Every one of these rules makes sense. The lawmaker who drew that line was solving a real problem. The employee enforcing it is applying the rule correctly. The small business owner just wants to sell pumpkins and not get fined.



Everybody did their job. That's the problem.



The problem isn't any single definition. It's that a person selling food doesn't get to serve one of them. Not a corporation with a tax department. A person. Running a farm stand. A food truck. A small Shopify shop selling hot sauce out of a garage. That person needs to figure out whether the thing they're selling is food, candy, a beverage, a prepared meal, or a decorative item, in every jurisdiction where they have a customer. Each one making perfect sense on its own. None of them making sense together.



Nobody's wrong. That's the problem.



They didn't write these rules. Neither did the employee who put me on hold. The system just grew, one reasonable decision at a time, until it became something no single person can reasonably navigate alone.



At my house, dinner ends eventually. Someone compromises. Someone tries something new. We figure it out. Four kids, one table.



A person selling food in America doesn't get that. They don't get one table. They get 13,000. And they're expected to serve all of them at once.

Maybe Im bit of shy and overthinker.
I’ve focused heavily on career and self-growth the last couple of years and somewhere along the way but, dating/social confidence didn’t get equal reps. I don’t drink, not into clubbing scenes, more of a gym,  spirituality, long walk, deep conversation type guy.
So this is me trying something different.

Happy to just chat here or over a call first. Meeting in person is optional and only if both of us feel comfortable — preferably in a public place.
Appreciate genuine effort over smooth talk
I Prefer public, safe, no-pressure meetups (coffee, walk near ur location (I stay near vikhroli/powai)
Are also tired of low-effort dating culture
I’d actually love advice — or even a conversation.
No rush, no expectations. Just two normal humans meeting in a public place and seeing if conversation flows.
Also open to honest feedback from women here: what makes someone easier to approach? What makes you feel safe and comfortable when a guy initiates?

Sigurado maraming girlfriends ang may high expectations sa mga boyfriends nila at hindi naman mali 'yun. Pero para sa akin, minsan pwedeng maging dangerous din yung katagang ""If he wanted to, he would"" dahil minsan, gusto naman talaga nila pero sadyang hindi pa kaya sa ngayon. Sabi nga, society has a way of making us believe that effort should always look grand, that love should always be visible, that if it's not big, hindi totoo. For context, my boyfriend is solo living in abroad right now, doing his masters. A full Japanese government scholar. Yung scholarship allowance niyang narerecieve, sobrang sakto lang para sa living expenses niya, given na nasa Tokyo siya. Kung ano-anong side hustle/part time jobs ang ginagawa masuportahan lang ang sarili sa pag-aaral at mairaos ang pangarap niyang makapag-masters sa dream program at uni niya. Renta, electric at water bills, pagkain, transpo, kung ano-ano pang importante sa pag-aaral niya, pinagkakasya niya dun ang scholarship allowance niya at kakaunting sweldo galing sa part time jobs niya, tapos nagpapadala pa siya sa pamilya niya sa Pinas.. Ngayong Valentines, walang-wala talaga siyang extra para makapagsend ng surprise sa akin. LDR kami, nasa pinas ako. Pwede kong isipin na ""hindi ako importante o priority"" kasi hindi man lang ako nabigyan ng bulaklak o tsokolate ngayong araw. Pero teka, yung lalaking hindi ako nabigyan ng bulaklak o tsokolate ngayong araw, ay ang parehong lalaki na pinapasaya ako araw-araw, tinatawagan ako kahit gaano siya ka-busy dahil pinagsasabay niya ang pag-aaral at mga part time jobs, siya rin yung lalaking hindi ako kailanman pinag-alala na baka ipagpalit ako sa malapit kasi never niyang pinaramdam sa akin na kapalit-palit ako, siya rin pala yung lalaking nakakaalam ng mga pinaka malalim kong sugat sa buhay pero patuloy na nagbubuhos ng pagmamahal at pagtanggap sa akin. Siya yung lalaking pinipili at minamahal ako araw-araw. Sobrang loyal and faithful. 

Kaya hindi, hindi totoong hindi niya ako mahal o hindi ako importante dahil lang hindi niya ako nabigyan ng bulaklak ngayong Valentines. Hindi iyon ang sukatan ko. Ah, oo, sinulatan niya ako ng sonnets. Palagi niya akong sinusulatan ng sonnets kahit noong nanliligaw pa lang siya. Nahihiya pa siya at sobrang nafi-feel bad kasi raw wala siyang maibigay na materyal na bagay sa akin ngayon. Sabi ko, walang problema, basahin niya kako yung sinulat niya para sa akin. Tumingin siya sa cam, tapos binasa yung sonnet na sinulat niya para sa akin. Medj napaluha pa siya. Mahal na mahal niya raw ako, at kung pwede niya raw ibigay sa akin ang mga tala at ang buong universe nung moment na yun, gagawin niya. Sobrang saya ng puso ko. Pagtapos nun, tinanong ko siya kung gusto niyang magkape, oo raw-- nagtimpla kami pareho ng 3in1 coffee haha-- siya sa Japan at ako naman sa Pilipinas. Sapat na yung moment na yun para maramdaman kong sobrang espeyal ako ngayong valentines day. 

Masaya ang mabigyan ng bulaklak, tsokalate, o fancy dinners kapag February 14. But may you never lose a GOOD MAN just because he doesn't fit social media's standards. 

""If he wanted to, he would"" yes, but sometimes, for some people, it's ""If he could, he would""
Not everyone is born privileged. Some people want to, pero hindi pa kaya. And that doesn't make their love any less real. 

Mahal ko, kung mababasa mo 'to, ipinagmamalaki kita at ang bawat tula na isinulat at isusulat mo pa para sa akin. Higit sa ano pa mang materyal na bagay, ikaw at ang pagiging mabuting tao mo, ang pinaka malaking regalo ng Langit sa akin. Sa iyo lang ang puso ko, habambuhay.

1r4s6is,https://www.reddit.com/r/hgh_t/comments/1r4s6is/my_force_factor_score_xxl_review_mild/,"My Force Factor Score XXL Review — Mild, Budget-Friendly, But Don't Expect Fireworks (3.2/5)","Tried Score XXL for a full 30 days, 3 tablets daily as directed. First week — felt absolutely nothing, which is normal for non-stimulant formulas.

By week 2-3, I started noticing mild improvements: slightly better energy in the gym, mildly improved pumps, and a modest bump in libido. Nothing life-changing, but definitely *something*.

By week 4, the blood flow benefits were more apparent — better workout pumps and slightly improved performance in the bedroom. The issue is the formula reads better than it performs.

The ""Blood Flow Stimulation Matrix"" is 1,575mg total but that has to cover L-Citrulline plus green coffee, green tea, tart cherry, turmeric, blueberry, broccoli, kale, and resveratrol — so the actual citrulline content is probably 800-1000mg at best, which is 60-80% below the 3000-6000mg clinical effective range.

The ""Masculine Endurance Compound"" crams black maca, tribulus, ginkgo, cordyceps, and DIM into just 450mg, meaning each ingredient is getting crumbs.

**They’ve packed way too many ingredients into tiny proprietary blends trying to make the label look impressive, but the math just doesn’t work out. NOT BAD but definitely NOT great! I’d rate this at like 3.2/5.**

**My Performance Breakdown:**

* **Blood Flow / Nitric Oxide: 2.5/5** — Mild improvement in pumps and circulation, and bedroom but L-Citrulline is severely underdosed for meaningful NO production. I’d rather recommend standalone L-citrulline supplement at 1500-3000mg dose.
* **Libido Enhancement: 3/5** — Subtle but noticeable boost by week 2-3, likely from the horny goat weed and maca combo; nothing dramatic though
* **Testosterone Support: 1.5/5** — Tribulus has repeatedly failed in studies, DIM is likely underdosed in that 450mg blend, zinc at 12mg is decent but won't move the needle alone
* **Energy & Stamina: 2.5/5** — The 155mg ""Superior Stamina System"" contains L-Theanine and caffeine from robusta extract; provides a very mild, smooth energy lift
* **Formula Transparency: 1.5/5** — Six proprietary blends hiding every single dosage; you have zero idea how much of anything you're actually getting
* **Value for Money: 3/5** — $10 sounds cheap until you realize that's only 10 servings, not 30; long-term use (which is necessary since these ingredients build up over time) costs $30/month, which changes the value equation significantly
* **Safety & Side Effects: 4.5/5** — No jitters, no crashes, no digestive issues; the conservative dosing makes it very well tolerated
* **Overall: 3.2/5** — A safe, mild, beginner-friendly formula that underdelivers on nearly every ingredient due to proprietary blend underdosing

**The bottom line:** Score XXL looks decent on paper — L-Citrulline, Horny Goat Weed, Maca, DIM, BioPerine — but the execution is underwhelming when you realize they've crammed 20+ ingredients into blends too small to deliver clinical doses of anything.

The $10 price tag seems like great value until you notice each bottle is only 10 servings, not a month's supply.

Since ingredients like maca and horny goat weed need consistent long-term use to really build up and deliver results, you're realistically looking at $30-50/month — at which point there are significantly better sexual health supplements available with transparent dosing and properly concentrated formulas that don't spread themselves paper-thin across two dozen ingredients.

1r4s4rw,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1r4s4rw/hi_im_18_and_occasionally_write_as_a_hobby_i_dont/,"Hi, I'm 18 and occasionally write as a hobby. I don't do it because I think I'll become a writer or anything like that, but simply for my own pleasure. However, it's always nice to ask for suggestions on how to improve. Here's my text: It was a Monday.","He really hoped the slipper wouldn't be seen. After all, anyone would find it strange for a man to walk around with a luxury slipper in his bag, and he absolutely didn't want anyone to think he was a thief; the mere thought disgusted him. So he decided to hide the bag in the space between himself and the wall.

""Want to order?""

""Huh?!""

He jumped, startled by the voice. He quickly turned toward the sound and immediately calmed down when he realized it was a waitress.

""Oh, yes, I'll have a coffee, please,"" he said, scratching his head nervously.

The noise of those watching the game had prevented him from hearing her approach.
""I noticed you really like our bar; it's already the fourth time you've been here this month.""

Ugh. He hated talking to people. He wasn't good with words at all; he preferred other ways of interacting.

""Haha, yeah, I love the coffee here,"" he replied, hoping his laugh sounded convincing.

""I'm glad you like it so much."" With that, the waitress left.

While he waited for his coffee, he observed the other customers, as was his habit. He enjoyed observing how people interacted with their surroundings.

At the far end of the room, he saw a single father playing with his daughter.
Across the room, a young couple: he couldn't hear what they were saying, but from the way they kept touching, he assumed they were dating.

Right in front of the entrance was a large television, probably seventy inches, which attracted a flock of customers like bread attracts pigeons to the square. Their applause and groans echoed throughout the bar, making it almost difficult to think.

He didn't know the teams playing. He had never been interested in football, and more generally, he had never felt drawn to what attracted most people. Having children, falling in love, making friends, things that, to him, seemed impossible. He felt completely incapable of building any kind of connection.

He didn't hate people; on the contrary. He had always felt a strong love for others, for the warmth they created by coming together. But he had never been able to express his affection in ways others could understand. He had always felt a huge gap between himself and the rest of the world.
He'd tried various sports, joined clubs, and participated in communities, but he'd never felt truly connected. And even when he pretended otherwise, others always noticed, preventing him from forming a true connection.

That was precisely why he hated thieves: petty beings who went around stealing and breaking other people's bonds, unaware of how important they could be. He knew they were just objects, but it was still sad to see something he'd grown fond of disappear.

He didn't have a mirror in front of him, but he imagined that from the outside he must have looked like a corpse.

He had to stop sinking into that depression. He couldn't wait for the moment to come.
As if hearing his wish, the waitress returned with the coffee. This time, having noticed her early, he managed to take the drink without being caught off guard. After thanking her, she left.

From the hand holding the cup, he felt a wave of warmth spread through his body. It wasn't that the cup was particularly warm, it was just that he'd always been cold. He couldn't remember a single time his touch had felt warmer than anyone else's.

Yet that warmth reminded him that he, too, had found a way to connect with others.

A work that always united everyone's hearts, regardless of their differences.

His work would soon be broadcast on TV. He was waiting for that very moment to start drinking the coffee. Not that he really wanted to drink it: from the almost nonexistent smell, he already knew it wouldn't be good at all. After all, he'd only gone there because it was crowded.
He continued to hold the cup in his hand, hoping it wouldn't cool too quickly.

Suddenly, he heard a chorus of ""no""s coming from the television. He couldn't help but smile, knowing what it meant.

The soccer game had been interrupted by a breaking news report.

They were talking about a murder. The fourth that month. The victim was Barbara Armani, an elderly local millionaire. Her entire family had died of old age before her; she had never married. She had been found on the couch with her throat slit. What raised the most questions was the almost complete lack of signs of theft: nothing seemed to be missing from the house. The only missing item was one of the woman's two slippers.

The reporter continued talking, but had already turned his attention to the customers.

The seemingly single father was covering his daughter's ears, a worried expression on his face.

The couple was arguing about who the killer might be.

The men in front of the television were wondering why the killer always stole slippers.

As he listened, he noticed that his normally bitter coffee was starting to taste sweet. Because in that single moment, every week, his heart felt connected to everyone else's.

He imagined it was the same feeling an artist gets when they observe the public's reaction to their work.",2,1771093955.0,writers,2,1.0,False
1r4s3uy,https://www.reddit.com/r/KentStateUniversity/comments/1r4s3uy/ranking_every_oncampus_dining_option/,Ranking Every On-Campus Dining Option,"This is the ranking you never asked for. I split it up by category.  


Dining Halls:

1. DI Hub - never had a bad meal here. The bowls are great and Southern Kitchen never misses. The new Craft salad station is decent too. Breakfast here is also good, I enjoy the omelette station a lot. The dessert station isn't half bad either. Just wish the hours were better.  
  
2. Eastway - or as I affectionally refer to it: ""shitway"". This place is rife with hits and misses. The Sapori station is a nice improvement imo. Choolah is decent as well. However, there is lots not to like about this place. Most of the other options are pretty gross, and if you want to have a quiet dinner here, you're SOL. It's open 7 days a week which is nice.

Residential:

1. Metro Deli - probably the most underrated spot on campus for food. Great sandwiches, and the store here is much nicer than the one at Rosie's.

2. Rosie's - it's so gross, probably my least favorite option on campus. There's just a stench whenever you go down here, and you can tell they use old frying oil. Additionally, the methods in which the food comes from is questionable (such as soups In bags). Everything just has this weird greasy taste. The only thing I get from here are the pancakes or breakfast burritos. I live in Tri and I absolutely despise this place.

Student Center:  
  
1. Golden Habanero - it sucks they don't accept meal exchange, but it seems like Kent is so focused on sucking their students dry so this comes as no surprise. Imo this place has the best food on campus. The burritos are massive and filling. I also like that they give you complementary chips as well.

2. Grill 72 - everyone was so upset when Tahini closed down there but imo it was the right decision. As discussed in a previous post, that place was rife with health code violations, and it was time for it to close. Grill 72 has some great burgers, and the Brownie a la Mode is nice as well. Another added bonus is that they accept meal exchange. My only gripe with this place is that the line can get long, so go during off-peak times. 

3. Recharge - close tie between this and Hippie Chicken for the third spot, but I went with Recharge for having more variety on the menu. Their smoothies are decent but nowhere as good as the Fruit Stand. Their sandwiches look decent as well, and it adds a nice variety to the student center.

4. Hippie Chicken - the major thing that this place has going for it is that it accepts meal exchange. Other than that, it is exceedingly average. The sandwiches are very bread heavy, and the chicken tenders are small. The fries also sit out all day, leading to them being gross and congealed. 

5. Homeslice - Kent State Culinary has never shined when it comes to pizza, and this place is no exception. I had it once and never again. This is basically a copy of the dining hall pizza, which is terrible. Don't waste your declining balance here.

NR: Einstein's Bagels - heard good things but have never gone myself.

Academic Building Locations:

1. Commerce Cafe (Business Building) - this place is awesome imo. I'm an aviation major so I don't come over here much, but the few times I've eaten here I've been very impressed. I had a Salmon Panini which was very good. The pickup boxes they have are also a nice touch. If I was over here more, I'd definitely go.

2. Charging Station (Aeronautics/Engineering Building) - I've gotten so bored of this place, but it's so average. The Tractor Juice machines look disgusting, and the pizzas are super greasy. I've had a BEC from here before, and it had zero flavor. The flatbreads are ok but hard to eat. I would recommend the Cinnamon Sugar Flatbread though.

NR: Starbucks (both locations) - I'm a guy so I don't need something crazy from here, usually I just get a drip coffee. The staff are typically friendly but drowning in orders. I feel bad for them. Overall, not enough visits to rank Starbucks. ",4,1771093895.0,KentStateUniversity,0,1.0,False

The key is to approach food spending with intention rather than impulse. With a few strategic adjustments to how you plan, shop, and cook, you can significantly lower your grocery and dining costs while still enjoying satisfying meals.

Start by tracking what you currently spend. Many people underestimate how much goes toward groceries, takeout, coffee, and snacks. Review your last one or two bank statements and total up every food-related purchase. Seeing the full number often highlights easy opportunities to cut back, such as frequent small purchases that add up quickly.

Meal planning is one of the most powerful ways to control food costs. Before shopping, plan your meals for the week based on what you already have at home and what’s on sale. Stores like Kroger and Walmart publish weekly ads online, making it easy to build meals around discounted items. Planning prevents last-minute takeout and reduces wasted ingredients that spoil before you use them.

Cooking at home more consistently can easily save $100 a month on its own. Even replacing two or three restaurant meals per week with home-cooked options makes a noticeable difference. Focus on simple, affordable staples such as rice, pasta, beans, eggs, and seasonal vegetables. Batch cooking and freezing portions for later also reduces the temptation to order delivery on busy days.

Another effective strategy is reducing food waste. Organize your refrigerator so older items are visible and easy to grab. Designate one night a week as a “use it up” meal where you combine leftovers or cook ingredients that are close to expiring. Cutting waste not only saves money but also stretches every grocery trip further.

Being mindful of brand choices also helps. Store brands often cost significantly less than name brands while offering similar quality. Comparing unit prices on shelf tags can reveal which option truly offers better value. Small price differences across multiple items can quickly add up to meaningful monthly savings.

Limiting convenience purchases is another major opportunity. Pre-cut fruit, single-serve snacks, bottled drinks, and individually packaged items typically carry a higher cost per serving. Preparing snacks at home and carrying a refillable water bottle can reduce impulse spending throughout the week.",1,1771093562.0,PoorMansWallet,0,1.0,False

The potential severity is not discussed often on this sub and I've found that typical skincare advice simply does not cut it for us. After much trial and error, I've finally got a system down that works for my skin. Hopefully, there is something here that can help you too 💜

**My qualifications 🫲😶🫱**

[https://imgur.com/a/nRF4Tvl](https://imgur.com/a/nRF4Tvl)

As you can see, the angriest PCOS-fueled cystic acne nearly took over my face, mainly around the cheeks and jawline. Now, two years later, I am clear besides a few breakouts here and there. All pictures are my washed, no makeup skin.

**Internal interventions that worked:**

* Cutting out/down processed sugar and carbs. 10/10. I was very strict for 3 months after the initial flare up, replacing my usual rice and pasta with carrots, brussel sprouts and sweet potatoes. Switched anything sweet to sugar-free. No coffee or alcohol. This significantly improved the acne and terrible mood swings. Eventually slowly reintroduced whole grain carbs and occasional processed carbs in moderation with plenty of fiber + protein.
* Spearmint tea/capsules. 7/10. Significant but incomplete reduction in acne for the \~3 months I was consistent with it. Two cups tea or 500mg capsules/day. The tea worked better and also stabilized mood with a calming/grounded effect that was very noticeable.
* Spironolactone 100mg daily. 9/10. Worked better than the spearmint. Taking it before bed reduces the side effects, otherwise staying well hydrated avoids most effects. Tolerating it pretty well and gets me 90-99% clear depending on the week!
* Drinking tons of water. 8/10. We're all dehydrated. Really surprised with how much better my skin heals when I actually drink enough water every day.

**Products that actually helped:**

* Double cleansing - Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil + Byoma Rice Deep Cleanser = gunk and oil GONE! without stripping the skin. I had a persistent issue with recommended cleansers stinging/aggravating my active breakouts. The Byoma cleanser is effective but does not sting at all, very safe for sensitive skin. I double cleanse in the evening and use only the Byoma cleanser in the mornings. Goated combo that took forever to perfect
* Mandelic Acid 10% - Used to use Face Reality and now use the Good Molecules serum in the daytime, before moisturizer. If you're new to acids, *DILUTE FIRST* and slowly work your way up as your skin heals. I have Fitzpatrick Type 4 skin and this works like ✨magic✨ for fading hyperpigmented scarring. Speeds up acne life-cycle too in my experience.
* Gel Moisturizer - Cocokind Electrolyte Water Cream is the only drugstore moisturizer that doesn't break me out. If you have oily but tight/flaky skin, its dehydrated! A glycerin-based lightweight moisturizer is actually what works best for our skin type to absorb into the skin, rather than just sitting on top of it. Pair with a hydrating toner before serums (I like Round Lab 1025 Dokto toner, very light and non-reactive) if you need more.
* SPF - Face Reality Mineral Matte 28 or Cocokind Daily Mineral SPF, both very acne-safe, well-absorbed and effective. *VERY IMPORTANT STEP IF YOU STRUGGLE WITH HYPERPIGMENTATION!* If you're Fitzpatrick Type 3/4+ any sun exposure will basically guarantee pigmented scarring. Wear your sunscreen every! day! no! exceptions! 🫵
* 10% Benzoyl peroxide - Don't care what anyone says, I have to put this on my *ENTIRE* face nightly otherwise will start getting closed comedones everywhere. Also why hydration and SPF is important, this stuff can be pretty harsh. After using it almost every day since age 12 my skin can handle it, but if you're new, start every other night just spot treating.
* Chemical peels/extractions - This arguably did the most for my skin in the initial healing period. If you can afford it, find a good esthetician and do monthly facials with extractions and light TCA peel. These really get all the gunk out as you work on internal triggers, and also quicken scar healing. If you can't do facials, then do a light peel at home *ONLY IF* you know your skin has built a tolerance to acids, and do your research beforehand‼️I use the Ordinary 30% AHA/BHA solution, 2 minutes on my face then cleanse, once a week. This keeps things clear enough to where I can go 2-3 months without a professional facial with minimal consequence.
* Take breaks every once in a while. Every 1-2 weeks, I'll go 24hrs with no actives, just cleanse and moisturize. Its beneficial to let your skin chill sometimes. A lot of wound healing and inflammation reduction happens these nights, I've observed.

At the end of the day, until you address the high testosterone or insulin resistance that normally triggers this type of acne, no amount of creams or products will do anything. I credit my skin in its current state to 50% spironolactone/anti-androgens, 20% facials, 15% diet/exercise and 15% skincare routine.

If you actually read through this, thank you! To anyone experiencing this kind of acne, I send my strength to you. Research, experiment, be consistent, and you will find a system that works for you 🙂‍↕️ 🫶",4,1771093306.0,PCOS,2,1.0,False

(I was at 155 and now i am at 134). All the postpartum weight from 3 kids all 8 and under and lack of self care and love during those postpartum years didn’t help lose the weight after each baby. 

Im due for a refill. Im currently at 1.12mg a week. My next dose is monday at 1.5mg. I lost more weight at the lower dosage around .9mg. I am going to refill my order and the next order is showing 1.5mg said a 3 month supply cost 499. I only paid 350 when i first ordered. Its making me hesitant to order. Ideally i want to lose another 5-10lbs. I am currently sitting at 134lbs for the last two doses at 1.12mg. And cannot lose it even with more working out, cut out sugary drinks (even my morning coffee with milk). 

I am trying to see if goby meds does discounts for refills or is that the best i will find for price?",1,1771093300.0,Semaglutide,2,1.0,False

1r4rt0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Leather-Buddy-7902/comments/1r4rt0h/my_first_big_feature_launch_almost_broke_me_and/,My first big feature launch almost broke me (and my sanity),"Okay, so I just survived my first major feature launch as a PM, and honestly, I'm not sure if I should be celebrating with champagne or a long, silent cry in a dark room. You know that feeling when everyone in the company has an opinion, and all those opinions are somehow wildly different, yet equally urgent? Yeah, that was my life for the past six months.

We were building this 'game-changing' analytics dashboard. Marketing wanted more pretty graphs, sales needed specific client data points (yesterday, obviously), and engineering kept sighing dramatically every time I mentioned a new integration. I remember sitting in one particularly brutal stakeholder meeting, the fluorescent lights humming overhead, feeling like a human punching bag while everyone threw requests at me. My head was spinning, trying to connect the dots between what users actually needed and what the execs *thought* they needed.

The development phase was a wild ride. Bugs popped up like whack-a-moles, deadlines shifted like sand dunes in a desert storm, and I swear I could physically feel the tension radiating from the dev team during daily stand-ups. There was this one night, just a week before launch, where a critical data inconsistency bug appeared. My heart absolutely sank. I spent hours with the lead engineer, fueled by stale coffee and sheer panic, just staring at lines of code until my eyes blurred. The pressure was immense, a constant knot in my stomach.

But somehow, we pulled it off. The dashboard went live, and the initial feedback has been surprisingly positive. Seeing users actually *use* something I helped bring to life, something that caused so many sleepless nights, is an incredible high. It’s like watching a fragile, complicated machine finally whir into life, exactly as you envisioned.

Still, the emotional rollercoaster of it all left me totally drained. Every 'win' felt hard-won, every 'loss' felt like a personal failure. It’s wild how much your emotional resilience gets tested in this role. Now I'm just trying to decompress.

So, fellow PMs, what's your most memorable (or traumatizing) launch story? How do you bounce back after a particularly brutal project?",1,1771093187.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

1r4rrw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1r4rrw3/if_someone_ghosts_you_but_keeps_watching_all_your/,"If someone ghosts you but keeps watching all your Instagram stories, what does that even mean?","Okay so this is probably a dumb question but it's genuinely confusing me.

I was talking to this guy for like 2 months. We went on a few dates, texted every day, things seemed to be going well. Then he just... stopped responding. No explanation, no ""hey I'm not interested anymore,"" just straight up ghosted me mid-conversation.

That was 3 weeks ago.

But here's the weird part: he watches EVERY SINGLE ONE of my Instagram stories. Like within minutes of me posting them. I'll post a random story about my coffee or whatever, and boom, there's his name in the viewers list.

He's not liking my posts. Not commenting. Not reaching out. Just silently watching my stories like some kind of digital lurker.

What is the logic here? If you're done with someone, why are you still keeping tabs on their daily life? And if you're interested enough to watch everything they post, why not just. text them?

Is this a thing people do? Is there a name for this? My friends say he's ""orbiting"" but I don't know if that's a real term or if they made it up.

I'm not trying to read too much into it, but it's just confusing. Like, pick a lane, either you want to stay in my life or you don't. The silent story-watching feels weirder than just unfollowing me completely.

Does anyone know why people do this? Is there actual psychology behind it or is he just bored and clicking through stories mindlessly?",2,1771093113.0,NoStupidQuestions,8,0.75,False
