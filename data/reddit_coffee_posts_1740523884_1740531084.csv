***Tuesday***

“Mason’s family has a nice setup here,” Skylar said as they passed over the final cattle grid and entered the space dedicated to the main house. It was night and day between the two areas, with a gorgeously manicured lawn on the house side and long grass meant for pasture on the other.

“It’s very rural,” Angus agreed tactfully.

The main house was two storeys, with the largest wrap-around veranda that Skylar had ever seen to double the floor space on the first floor that sat three steps above ground level. White latticework was installed behind the steps, probably to keep animals from hiding under the house, and white-painted wooden spindles created a waist-high balustrade. The walls were also white, except for the red brick in the corners of the building, the chimney, and as a background accent for the bright red double front doors. Beige shutters framed each of the eight front-facing windows.

As Angus pulled up outside the house, one of the two front doors opened, and a teenager, most likely Mason’s little sister, came running to the edge of the veranda.

Of the three men that were following them, only the motorbike crossed the cattle grid to come into the homestead, and only after whoever was riding it waited long enough to pick up one of the two horse riders. The other rider stayed behind to secure the reins to the fence before jogging the rest of the way.

Skylar realised that the person getting the ride was much older than she’d first thought, especially when the motorbike pulled up behind them, and the passenger used the rider’s shoulders to lift himself from the seat.

Leaving the air-con on for Spike, Angus and Skylar exited the car together, with Angus coming around to stand alongside Skylar while everyone else regrouped at the foot of the stairs. Their poise had them almost in a defensive line, and Skylar certainly hoped Angus didn’t take it that way.

The older man tipped back his worn cowboy hat to look at them.

“We were told you were expecting us,” Angus said to break the silence. He reached out his hand to the older man, who Skylar guessed was Mason’s grandfather. “Angus.”

“Dustin,” the old man replied, shaking his hand. He jerked a thumb over his shoulder. “This ere’s me grandson Bill, ’n Mason’s pa, Todd.”

Mason’s father had been the one securing the horses, so he’d also been the last to shake hands with Angus.

As Todd stepped back, Angus curled his arm around Skylar’s waist. “And this is my wife, Skylar.” It flowed so easily from his lips that Skylar wondered how many times he’d said it in relation to Coraltin.

Dustin had been in the process of reaching for Skylar when he paused, and even Mason’s father stiffened. “As in Mason’s vet-boss from the city?” the older man asked with his head cocked to one side, proving there was nothing wrong with his mind despite his advanced age.

Skylar realised she was going to have to think quickly. Despite having the option to lie about who she was, she knew if they ever met her down the road as Mason’s boss, it would make things incredibly difficult for all concerned.  “Yes, that’s me. I’m still technically on my honeymoon at the moment, so Mason asked if we would swing in on our way past to drop off Spike.”

“Honeymoons,” the older man snorted derisively. “No time for that slicker nonsense ’ere.”

Ben grimaced, then moved past his grandfather to take her hand in his, adding the other to the handshake to instil his sincerity. “It’s a pleasure to meet you …Mrs—?”

*Yeah, right.* As if she was going to admit her marriage could technically revert her name to Nascerdios. “Just Skylar, please. I’m not changing my last name.”

“Why not?” Dustin asked, appalled. “How else are people meant to know y’ ain’t single no more?” He then looked at her left hand. “Specially when y’ ain’t wearin’ no weddin’ ring neither.”

“They open their mouths an’ ask, Gramps,” the teenager replied from the veranda.

The patriarch of the family swung side-on and scowled up at her. “I knew there weren’t nuthin’ wrong with you, missy. Time of the month, my ass. Get your tail back to your less’ns ’fore I find somethin’ better for y’all to do.”

While the teenager promptly disappeared back inside, Todd took Skylar’s hand and repeated his name in case she hadn’t caught it the first time. The man’s face was almost as weather-worn as his father’s behind him, but there was a kindness in his eyes that Skylar had seen every time she looked at Mason.

“I just wanted y’ to know, we really appreciate everythin’ y’ve done for our boy. He’s a good, strong young man with a smart head on his shoulders. Mebbe he gets a little bit too full of himself at times an’ his mouth gets him int’ all sorts a’ trouble, but his heart’s always been in the right place. Just don’t let him get away with too much, and if he gives you any hassles, give us a call. We’ll sort him out.”

Skylar started to understand where Mason got his motormouth from and swallowed her amusement as she returned the handshake. “I’ll keep that in mind, Mister Williams, though I doubt—”

“Todd, please. Call me Todd.”

“Of course—”

“Oh, for goodness sake, what kind a’ mann’rs y’all call this, leavin’ our guests out here to cook in the sun!”  a new, more mature female voice called from the veranda, and when Skylar looked up, there was an older woman with the same size, stature and waves of sun-bleached light brown hair as Mason standing in the open doorway. She stepped out and closed it behind her, wiping her icing powdered hands once more on the thin apron she wore around her waist.  

Todd let go of Skylar’s hands and joined the woman when she came down the stairs, though he kept over a foot of distance between them out of habit. All the men did, and Skylar guessed decades of living together had taught them not to touch her while they’d been out working, and she was prepping food.

“June, this is Skylar Hart and her husband, Angus. Skylar, Angus, this is Mason’s mother, June.”

June Williams balked for half a second, then smiled broadly and wrapped Skylar up in a huge hug. “Oh, it’s so wond’ful to meet y’all,” she said, pulling back long enough to squeeze Skylar’s shoulders. “Mason didn’t say it were you comin’, but please, do come in. I’ve just finished icin’ a lavenda’ cake an’ I made a batch of Scotcheroos that’ve just set up. There’s also tea, green tea and coffee, since I weren’t sure what y’all tastes would be.”

Skylar had no idea what either of those foods tasted like, but the three men's appreciative breathing and straightening expressions suggested they were highly prized. “We’d love to, thank you.”

Bill moved as if he had every intention of entering the house, but his uncle (Skylar assumed Todd was his uncle since he was Dustin’s grandson and Mason had no brothers, only one sister) grabbed him by the back of his flannel shirt and hauled him back towards his bike.

“We don’t eat ’til we’re done,” Dustin said in agreement. The oldest of the three generations then tipped his hat to Skylar and Angus and said, “Pleasure meetin’ y’all.”

“You c’d stay here if you want, Pa,” Todd said in earnest. “Me ’n the boys can finish patchin’ up the north fence. Y’ve been goin’ at it since four this mornin’.”

“As’ve you,” Dustin growled at his son.

“Yeah, but I ain’ goin’ on nine’y eetha’.” Todd’s expression softened. “Come on, Pa. Y’r s’pose to be retired. Go ’n take a load off.”

Suddenly the motorbike engine kicked over, and Bill swung his bike towards the front drive, dropping it into gear and taking off the way he’d come.

Dustin snorted at his vanishing back.

“Leave ’im be, Pa. He ain’t stupid enough t’ hang around while we try ’n talk some sense int’ ya.”

“Stop badgerin’ me, boy!” Dustin snapped. “If I feel like it, I’ll stay f’r a bite ’n join y’all on the fence line shortly.”

Todd nodded with a knowing smile, and Skylar could guess why. Dustin may be from an era that didn’t know how to stop, but at his age, once he did, stiffness would set in, and he wouldn’t be in any shape to start again until he’d had a good night’s sleep. Todd then looked at Angus and Skylar and repeated the same brim tap his father had used. “Pleasure meetin’ y’all,” he parroted with a warm smile.

“Likewise,” Skylar grinned back.

June slid her arm through Skylar’s and led her up the stairs first. Angus and Dustin fell in behind.

“I tell y’, getting’ old’s one a’ the worst things about livin’ so long,” Dustin griped in a lowered voice that June obviously wasn’t meant to hear.

“Dying young would be worse,” Angus countered.

“Wait’ll y’ get to my age, son. Then y’ll see.”

“Wait’ll you get to mine,” Angus countered, and Skylar could practically feel his mischievous grin behind her.

She rolled her eyes and shook her head.

# The Quiet Resistance

Professor Eleanor Harlow never meant to become a revolutionary. She'd spent forty-three years teaching in the same brick building at Covington College, wearing the same three cardigans in rotation until they frayed at the elbows. She'd always considered herself unremarkable—a woman who collected teacups, who still wrote letters to her sister in Michigan on monogrammed stationery, who couldn't properly program her thermostat.

When the government changed, she'd initially continued her routines: toast with marmalade at 6:15 AM, the walk to campus with her canvas tote bag swinging against her hip, office hours where she'd perch on her squeaky chair and dispense advice about comma splices.

The surveillance drones appeared in her seventieth year, hovering outside her office window like peculiar birds. Eleanor found herself tilting her head at them as she might at a puzzling student essay. They were there the morning she received the directive: **all syllabi required pre-approval from the Department of Educational Integrity.**

She pressed the paper flat on her desk with hands spotted like a speckled egg, smoothing it as she might a tablecloth before company. The radiator in her office hissed and clanked, maintaining its decades-old argument with winter.

""Well,"" she said to no one.

""We're discussing Orwell today,"" Eleanor told her Advanced Composition class, noting the government monitor in the back row, a young man who reminded her oddly of her nephew—the same habit of clearing his throat before typing something into his tablet. ""But I'd like you to consider how his insights might apply to historical examples beyond the Soviet context.""

The classroom had that particular Wednesday afternoon smell—damp wool coats, coffee, the faint chemical tang of whiteboard markers.

After class, she approached Maya, a quiet girl who wore the same green scarf every day, wound three times around her neck like armor. ""Your essay on rhetorical analysis was excellent. I'd like to offer you a spot in my writing workshop.""

The ""workshop"" had begun almost by accident, with a few students who lingered after class, then continued discussions in Eleanor's living room, sitting on her mismatched furniture beneath the faded landscape paintings her mother had left her. The group grew to twenty-three. Eleanor served her grandmother's gingersnaps on chipped plates and, almost without intending to, they began documenting the regime's abuses.

""It's the small details that matter,"" Eleanor explained, stirring her tea with the silver spoon her ex-husband Thomas had once given her for their anniversary. ""Not just the big arrests they try to hide, but the little changes—the bakery that closed because the owner said the wrong thing, Mrs. Abernathy's son who didn't come home from university.""

The students sat in her living room beneath the lamp with the crooked shade, some on cushions on the floor because there weren't enough chairs. Outside, a neighbor's wind chimes punctuated their conversation with tinkling discord.

Eleanor had collected histories of Chile, Poland, South Africa, ordering them from the campus bookstore before such books were restricted, reading them late into the night with her glasses sliding down her nose. ""It's like sorting laundry,"" she told the group. ""We separate what's true from what isn't.""

Maya held up her phone. ""They've blocked another three news sites today.""

Eleanor reached into the cabinet where she kept her late mother's recipe box, pulling out pamphlets hidden behind index cards for pound cake and pot roast. ""Then we use paper,"" she said. ""Just like passing notes in class.""

The network grew like a patchwork quilt—piece by piece, pattern by pattern. The university librarian who lived with seven cats in a Victorian on Elm Street. The retired reporter who ran the hobby shop downtown and knew everyone's business. The mail carrier who had delivered to the same routes for thirty years and could track where people had gone.

Eleanor recorded testimonies at her scratched kitchen table, offering tea and patience while survivors talked. She kept the records in an alphabetized filing system because proper organization had always mattered to her. When they uncovered the regime's financial dealings, it was because someone noticed a recurring decimal point in an obscure budget report—the kind of error that Eleanor had always circled in red on student papers.

They came for her on a Tuesday morning. Eleanor had just watered her African violets and was considering what to make for lunch. The officers tracked mud onto her foyer carpet, and she very nearly asked them to wipe their feet.

""Professor Harlow, do you understand the charges against you?"" the judge asked. Eleanor noticed he had the same slightly crooked collar that her colleague Professor Winters always had—the sign of a man who dressed without a mirror.

""I understand that documenting truth is not a crime in any just society,"" Eleanor replied, thinking about the plants in her apartment that no one would water, the students who would wonder where she'd gone.

In prison, she taught three fellow inmates to read, organized the meager library by subject, and kept mental notes on the guards' rotating schedules. Her absence became a presence in the movement she'd inadvertently created. People who had never met Eleanor Harlow began doing what she had done—watching, recording, remembering.

Three years later, Eleanor stood at a podium on the university quad, leaning slightly to compensate for the hip that had never quite healed after her time in prison. She wore her best cardigan—blue with pearl buttons—and had pinned her white hair in a bun that morning with shaking fingers.

The provisional government had asked her to speak at the Day of Restoration ceremony. Eleanor had drafted seven versions of her speech, then discarded them all for being too grandiose. In the end, she'd written something simple on a recipe card.

""I'm not sure how I ended up here,"" she told the crowd, adjusting her glasses. ""I was only doing what my mother taught me to do—tell the truth and keep good records.""

She looked out at faces she recognized and many she didn't. Former students who now ran newspapers and government offices. The baker who had reopened her shop. Mrs. Abernathy, whose son had finally returned home.

""Writing things down matters. Not because words themselves have power, but because they connect us to each other. They remind us what's real."" She paused to turn her recipe card over. ""When we agree on what's real, we can begin to fix what's broken.""

The applause surprised her—it seemed excessive for such a simple thing.

Afterward, Eleanor declined three dinner invitations and walked home alone, wanting to check on her apartment. The key still stuck in the lock the way it always had. Inside, someone had watered her plants. On her kitchen table sat a box of student essays waiting to be graded, a reminder that ordinary life continued alongside extraordinary events.

She put on the kettle for tea, opened her grade book, and uncapped her red pen. There would be time for everything else tomorrow.The Quiet Resistance

My name is David, and I’m a 29-year-old IT tech from New Jersey on a quest for a meaningful, long-term relationship with someone who shares my values and passions.

**A bit about me:**

I’m about 5’10”, bald but naturally blond, and I sport a stylish beard. My usual attire includes black band shirts and black jeans—think laid-back, metal-head vibes with a touch of nerdy charm. If that sounds like your kind of aesthetic, we might just click! (Pics here: [https://imgur.com/a/la9rWt0](https://imgur.com/a/la9rWt0))

**What I’m into:**

When I’m not diving into the worlds of extreme metal (Black Metal is my jam) or gaming, I enjoy spending time with friends doing things like:

• Camping trips under the stars

• Exploring museums

• Renaissance faire adventures

• Watching movies (especially showing my best friend ones he hasn’t seen)

• Playing board games or video games

Recently, I’ve started learning a new language (こんにちは!) and experimenting with building Gundam model kits.

**Professionally:**

I work in IT and hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. My job keeps me busy but also lets me hang out with a great group of coworkers.

**Personality-wise:**

I’m laid-back, lighthearted, and always quick with a joke to brighten the mood. I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs (not even coffee!), but I’m completely cool with others enjoying their drinks around me. My friends would probably describe me as funny, reliable, and someone who thrives on meaningful connections.

**What I’m looking for:**

I’m hoping to meet someone younger (ideally between 18 and 24) who’s also looking to build a future together. I’d love to find someone whose experiences and goals align with mine, so we can grow and share meaningful moments side by side. While I don’t have a timeline in mind for things like eloping or kids, I value the idea of creating a life full of shared adventures and growth.

I’m especially drawn to someone with an average or slim body type. I’m not a fan of tattoos, but piercings aren’t a big deal, so don’t hesitate to reach out if we connect on other levels!

If you’re a fellow nerd, gamer, or someone who shares my love for metal, movies, and meaningful connections, I’d love to hear from you. Send me a message and a picture—I’m looking forward to getting to know you better!",1,1740530623.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I have had bowel problems for as long I can remember in my 35 years of life. Mostly just constipation throughout my teenage and early adult hood years. I started to notice severe issues with my motility when I was 28 but I was eating bad so I chalked it up to my diet and tried OTC medications. I do know that bowel problems run on both sides of my family as well as Lupus, RA, MS, stomach cancer and the like. My mother expressed concern about those as she was struggling with her diverticulitis. It wasn't until I was 31 when I went to the hospital and had not had a bowel movement for over a month when I saw a gastroenterologist for the first time. He was very rushed and took one look at me and told I had IBS-C and gave me Linzess 290mg to take and shooed me out without doing any testing, but it worked!

It worked. I started having bowel movements everyday again! It was fantastic! Until it didn't hahaha. All of a sudden the linzess stopped being so good and I went from every day to every 3 then once a week. It wasn't until in November of 2024 when I was suffering so much pain and I was starting to vomit up what appeared to be coffee grounds. My gastro wasn't answering me back so I went to the hospital and worked with them and got set up with a gastro team from them. From there I have had a upper GI endoscopy performed this month 02/05/25 and he diagnosed me with gastroparesis as I had food still in my stomach body and I ate dinner at 6pm the day before the procedure and I didn't eat or drink anything after midnight and had the test done at 11 am. So after 17 hours food was still in my stomach body. And I don't go back to see him until the 20th of March for the follow up for the visit and the diagnoses and I saw another post of someone test result for a gastric emptying test and it has gotten me curious as he never told me how severe it was. Just when I woke up to hey eat small, meals and drink water. He put me on miralax once in the morning and once in the evening for right now to try and clear me out. 

I am unsure if they will do a gastric emptying test after that upper GI. So with that said and out of the way, would mine be a moderate or severe case from seeing the results people post from theirs 132 minutes is the normal time frame. I mean I guess typing it out already it's pretty severe hahahaha but I just wanted to still ask and talk. Get some engagement and talk to people who also suffer and feel kinship.

1iyal0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wirelessearbudsreview/comments/1iyal0v/could_sony_wfc500_be_the_best_wireless_earbuds/,Could Sony WF-C500 be the Best Wireless Earbuds for Everyday Use? A Detailed Review,"Testing out the Sony WF-C500 wireless earbuds has been a daily routine for me over the past few weeks. These compact in-ear headphones come with a wireless charging case, built-in microphone, Bluetooth connectivity, and are voice assistant compatible. For someone who’s always on the go, they seem like an excellent choice at first glance. But are they truly the best wireless earbuds for their price? Let’s dive in.

**Fit & Comfort**

The snug fit of these earbuds is one of their standout features. They come with hybrid silicone ear tips that you can customize for a more secure fit. I wore them during a long morning jog, and not once did they threaten to fall out. Even during extended use, say a 14-hour shift, they felt comfortable in my ears without causing fatigue. However, I noticed that the fit might vary if you have particularly small or large ear canals, so the comfort may not be universal.

**Features**

What impressed me the most was their seamless integration with voice assistants. A simple press lets you connect effortlessly to your phone’s assistant, whether it’s Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant. Additionally, the built-in microphone ensures clear call quality, even in slightly noisy environments. The Bluetooth range of 10 meters was adequate for moving around the house without the phone in hand.

[Check Sony WF-C500 price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b09fkgj1cb/)

**Sound Quality & Performance**

The sound profile leans toward balanced, with a clear emphasis on mids and highs. Bass lovers may find them lacking a bit of punch, though the equalizer settings in the Sony Headphones Connect app allow some degree of customization. Audiophiles might not be blown away, but for casual listeners, the overall sound quality is satisfying. I tested them with various genres of music, podcasts, and calls, and they performed consistently well.

**Battery Life & Charging**

Battery life is where these earbuds truly shine. On a full charge, the earbuds provide up to 10 hours of playback, and the charging case adds another 10 hours. That’s a total of 20 hours, which is more than enough for a day’s use. The charging time is about 2.5 hours, which is fairly standard. Unfortunately, there’s no fast charging feature, which would have been a nice addition for those moments when you’re in a hurry.

**Design & Build Quality**

The minimalist design is appealing, with a matte finish that doesn’t attract fingerprints. Despite being made of plastic, they feel sturdy and well-crafted. Their compact size makes them easy to carry around in a pocket or bag. That said, the absence of premium materials like metal or higher-grade plastic is noticeable, but forgivable considering the price point.

**Durability & Water Resistance**

While they’re not marketed as waterproof, they are rated IPX4 for splash resistance. This means light rain or sweat won’t harm them, but dropping them in water is a no-go. I learned this the hard way after accidentally letting one fall into the sink. Though I retrieved it immediately, the damage was beyond repair. So, it’s a good idea to be cautious around water.

**Noise Cancellation & Ambient Mode**

These don’t offer active noise cancellation, which could be a dealbreaker for some people. However, they do provide decent passive noise isolation due to their snug fit. If you’re in a bustling coffee shop or office, they block out enough noise for a pleasant listening experience. There’s no ambient sound mode either, which might make them less suitable for outdoor runners who need to stay aware of their surroundings.

**Warranty**

Sony offers a 1-year limited warranty for these earbuds, covering manufacturing defects. I haven’t had the need to claim it yet, but it’s reassuring to know it’s there. Some users online have expressed difficulty in getting replacements or repairs under warranty, so this might be an area where Sony could improve.

**Advantages**

* Excellent battery life, lasting up to 20 hours with the case.
* Good sound quality with a balanced profile.
* Compact and lightweight design for portability.
* Seamless voice assistant integration.
* Comfortable fit, even for extended wear.

**Shortcomings**

* No active noise cancellation or ambient sound mode.
* Lack of water resistance beyond light splashes.
* Build quality feels less premium due to plastic materials.
* No fast charging feature.

**Competing Options**

When comparing the Sony WF-C500 to its competitors, like the Jabra Elite 3 and Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro, it holds its ground in some areas but lags in others. The Jabra Elite 3 offers better water resistance with an IP55 rating and a slightly more robust build. Meanwhile, the Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro provides active noise cancellation and a more immersive sound profile. If you prioritize durability or noise-canceling features, those alternatives might suit you better. However, the Sony WF-C500 wins in terms of comfort and battery life.

**True Value**

Considering the features and performance, these earbuds offer good value for the price. They strike a nice balance between cost and functionality, making them ideal for casual listeners and those who want reliable, everyday earbuds. While they’re not perfect, they deliver where it matters most—comfort, battery life, and sound quality.

1iyak9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1iyak9t/what_makes_the_breville_barista_touch_impress/,What makes the Breville Barista Touch Impress Espresso Machine BES881BSS worth your attention? Review of this premium espresso maker.,"**Design & Build Quality**  
The moment I unboxed the Breville Barista Touch Impress, I was struck by its sleek brushed stainless steel finish. It has a clean, modern aesthetic that blends seamlessly into any kitchen. The machine feels solid and well-constructed, weighing in at a hefty 24.2 pounds. Clearly, this isn’t a flimsy appliance—it screams durability. The touchscreen interface caught my eye immediately, offering a polished and intuitive way to navigate the machine's settings. However, the display is prone to smudges, which means constant wiping if you want it to look pristine.

**Coffee Quality**  
Coffee aficionados rejoice! This machine produces espresso shots that are rich, flavorful, and aromatic. The automatic temperature control ensures consistent results, and the integrated grinder with 30 precision settings allows me to customize the grind size to my liking. I’ve tried various beans, from medium roasts to dark blends, and the machine brings out their distinct flavor profiles. Still, some users have noted that shots can occasionally lack the robust crema you’d expect from a high-end espresso maker. Personally, I found this to be rare, but it’s worth mentioning.

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**  
The Auto MilQ steam wand elevates this espresso machine beyond just brewing. It delivers silky microfoam, perfect for cappuccinos and lattes, and even allows for latte art if you’re feeling fancy. What impressed me most is the alternative milk settings, which are tailored for different milk types, such as oat or almond. This feature is especially useful for my lactose-intolerant friends. However, the frothing process isn’t entirely foolproof—there were a couple of instances when the frother seemed less efficient after repeated uses.

[Don’t miss Breville Barista Touch Impress BES881BSS deals—check Amazon here.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0c1t4w797/)

**Features**  
This machine is packed with features that make it stand out. The assisted tamping system ensures an even and precise tamp every time, which is crucial for consistent espresso extraction. The touchscreen interface is a game-changer, offering eight café-style presets and the ability to customize up to eight drinks. The ThermoJet heating system is another highlight, reaching the optimal brewing temperature in just three seconds. However, some users have mentioned that the water temperature occasionally dips, which could affect the quality of the espresso.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**  
Cleaning this machine is relatively straightforward. It comes with a cleaning disc, brush, and tablets, along with a water hardness strip for testing. The drip tray is easy to remove and clean, though it requires frequent emptying due to its smaller size. The steam wand’s auto-cleaning feature is convenient, but I noticed it doesn’t always remove all milk residue, so manual cleaning is sometimes necessary.

**Brewing Performance**  
Brewing with this machine feels like having a barista in your kitchen. The intelligent dosing system adjusts the coffee grind and corrects dosing for subsequent shots. This ensures a balanced and consistent cup of espresso. I also appreciate the hands-free operation, especially when I’m rushing in the morning. While the machine performs admirably for the most part, there’s a slight learning curve to achieve the perfect grind size and extraction time.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**  
The Breville Barista Touch Impress is relatively quiet compared to other machines I’ve used, making it ideal for early mornings when everyone else is still sleeping. Its energy-saving features, like the automatic shut-off, give it a green thumbs-up. However, the grinder, while quieter than most, might still be a bit noisy for some.

**Water Tank & Capacity**  
The water tank holds enough for multiple drinks, reducing the need for constant refills. It also comes with a built-in water filter, which is a nice touch. That said, the tank isn’t the easiest to remove, and filling it can be slightly awkward depending on your kitchen setup.

**Warranty & Support**  
Breville offers a standard one-year warranty, which is reassuring but not extraordinary for a product at this price point. Their customer service is responsive, and they provide detailed guides and videos for troubleshooting. That said, I’ve read mixed reviews about support experiences, so your mileage may vary.

**Good Points**

* The touchscreen interface makes customization simple and intuitive.
* Impressive milk frothing capabilities with alternative milk settings.
* Quick ThermoJet heating system saves time.
* Durable and stylish stainless steel design.

**Areas of Concern**

* Occasional inconsistencies with water temperature.
* Smudges on the touchscreen can be frustrating.
* The drip tray requires frequent emptying.

**Competitive Options**  
When comparing this espresso maker to others in its class, a few models stand out. For example, the De’Longhi Dinamica offers a similar level of customization and milk frothing but lacks the touchscreen simplicity. On the flip side, the Jura E8 is a powerhouse for espresso quality but comes with a significantly higher price tag. The Breville Barista Touch Impress strikes a balance, making it ideal for those who want high-end features without venturing into the ultra-premium price range.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
While the initial investment is steep, the quality and features justify the price for coffee enthusiasts. The ability to create café-quality drinks at home also means fewer trips to your local coffee shop, saving money in the long run. However, if you’re not someone who values customizable settings and advanced features, there are more budget-friendly options that might suit your needs.

1iyainw,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1iyainw/why_is_the_waterdrop_wdmnr35_remineralization/,Why is the Waterdrop WD-MNR35 remineralization filter worth your attention? A detailed review,"Having tested the Waterdrop WD-MNR35 remineralization filter for my reverse osmosis system over several months, I’ve gathered hands-on insights into its performance, installation process, and overall value. While it comes with notable advantages, there are a few aspects to be aware of before making a purchase.

**Ease of Installation & Use**

One of the standout features of this filter is its straightforward installation process. With its 1/4"" quick-connect fittings, I managed to attach it to my existing under-sink reverse osmosis system in under 10 minutes, and no tools were required. Cutting the tubing and pressing it into place felt almost too easy. If you’re someone who dreads complicated DIY projects, this filter’s plug-and-play design will come as a relief. I even helped my neighbor install one on their system, and they were impressed by how user-friendly it was.

**Filtration Technology & Effectiveness**

This filter uses PCC (Post-Carbon Composite) technology, aiming to restore essential minerals like calcium and magnesium to your water. After installation, I noticed a significant improvement in taste—it had a cleaner, almost spring-like quality. However, it’s worth mentioning that the remineralization process doesn’t completely replicate the mineral content of natural spring water. My TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) readings increased from 7 ppm to 27 ppm, which aligns with what the product promises. While some might find the taste slightly chalky, others could appreciate the newfound mineral richness.

[Check Waterdrop WD-MNR35 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b08dxyl81c/)

**Flow Rate & Performance**

The flow rate didn’t suffer much after adding the remineralization filter, which was a pleasant surprise. I’ve used other filters in the past that severely restricted water flow, making it frustrating to wait for a glass of water. This one maintained a steady and quick flow, even under consistent daily use for drinking, cooking, and coffee-making. However, I did notice a slight dip in flow after a few months, possibly signaling it was time for replacement.

**Filter Lifespan & Replacement**

The manufacturer claims the filter can last between 9 to 12 months or 1,100 gallons, depending on usage. Based on my daily consumption, I anticipate replacing it around the 10-month mark. It’s great that replacement doesn’t require additional tools or professional help. That said, I would have appreciated if the package included blue locking clips to secure the connections better—something I had to buy separately.

**Capacity & Suitability**

This filter is versatile enough to fit most reverse osmosis systems, as long as they use 1/4"" tubing. I’ve personally connected it to a Waterdrop G2 system, but I also tried it with a friend’s APEC system, and it worked flawlessly. If you’re considering it for a refrigerator or other water purifier, its compatibility makes it a flexible option. However, note that it’s not compatible with the X series reverse osmosis systems.

**Certifications**

The WD-MNR35 is RoHS certified, which means it adheres to strict environmental and safety standards. Knowing that the product is tested and certified adds peace of mind, especially when it comes to something as essential as drinking water.

**Warranty**

The product comes with a one-year warranty, which is fairly standard for filters in this category. While I haven’t had any issues requiring warranty support, the positive customer service experiences shared in other reviews suggest that any potential problems would be addressed efficiently.

**Advantages**

* Enhances water taste by adding essential minerals like calcium and magnesium
* Easy installation with no tools required
* Compatible with most reverse osmosis systems
* Maintains steady water flow even with daily use

**Drawbacks**

* Packaging doesn’t include locking clips for secure installation
* Some users might find the taste slightly chalky
* Limited impact on TDS levels compared to natural spring water

**Market Rivals**

When compared to other remineralization filters such as the AIMRO cartridge or the APEC FI-PHPLUS-QC, the Waterdrop WD-MNR35 holds its ground in terms of ease of installation and taste improvement. However, the AIMRO filter offers a clearer housing, allowing you to see what’s inside, which some users might prefer. On the other hand, the APEC FI-PHPLUS-QC provides a slightly higher TDS bump but is more expensive and bulkier. The Waterdrop filter strikes a balance between affordability and functionality, making it a strong contender for most households.

**Cost Effectiveness**

Considering its performance and longevity, this filter offers great value for its price. While it’s not the cheapest option, its quality and compatibility justify the investment. If you’re looking for a reliable remineralization filter that doesn’t break the bank, this is a solid choice. It also saves money in the long run by reducing the need for bottled mineral water, which can add up quickly.

Last week there was a Church-related social and I talked to a few people (I'm a social butterfly and find it super easy to talk to lots of people). I spoke with one guy for a bit, and there was another girl involved in the conversation. Majority of the conversation had all three of us in it other than when she briefly left for a bit.

  
He reached on social media and asked if I wanted to continue our conversation over a coffee but I'm not interested, and while the conversation was good I don't think we're compatible.

It is so lovely to see men finally shooting their shot through an organic IRL interaction, but I'll be honest in saying this particular individual has no chance as I'm not physically attracted to him at all, and think it would be mean and disingenuous to say yes for the sake of appearing to be nice.

-blue lagoon is touristy but breathtaking and the facility is clean, organized, easy to navigate

-Gljufrabui waterfall - easy turn off the south ring road,  available parking, and easy trails to waterfalls. I did fall on ice here so put on the crampons in winter even though it's a short walk

-Breiðamerkursandur/Diamond beach - stunning scenery, got to watch seals play in the water

-Katla ice caves (constantly changing due to melt) - this hike was in the sleet and I imagined I was climbing Everest. One of the coolest experiences to be inside the glacier 

-Caves of Hella - intimate family-run tours of archeological caves, some of which have art/language carvings in the rock

-The Geothermal Park Hveragerði - watch a geyser erupt, boil some eggs and bake some bread in the ground using geothermal heat - then save the recipe to bake some yummy bread after you return home 

I couldn't recommend this country enough. As a solo female traveler, I always felt safe and comfortable here and it was a beautiful and peaceful place to unplug, refresh, and re-center.

Grace was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 26 birthday growing up in a small town with a big city feel to her. But to Grace it was her home but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city that she would ride her bike through towns streets. 

Weaving in and out of cars passing by them feeling free from the world around her feeling the wind blowing wildly through her long brown hair. Racing as the excitement showed in her smile saying it all. Making her through the towns traffic passing by people with some waving as she passed by.

With Grace having the feeling of nothing could stop her from trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement mainly it was just them watching out for her own safety. Grace was just your typical young green eyed girl who liked her shredded jeans tee shirt and hoodie living her life her way. 

Occasionally finding some of the local boys racing with her trying to out do one another. With Grace being the girl that she was never backing down from a challenge, found herself racing through the streets along with one or two others.

Not to say that one didn’t catch her eye from time to time his name was Hector’ Hector was a guy that charm on a dime. Who had a keen mind and the street smarts to match especially on a bike.

But at the same time finding himself racing along side of Grace’ whether it be on the streets or on one of many mountain trails that surrounded them.

Knowing that Grace a well to do girl, finding himself with Grace leaving him with a glance and a smile as Grace left him looking. 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile she was a girl with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches. Gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets of San Francisco. Often finding herself riding her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape. She even had a name for her bike often calling it ‘Quicksilver’ riding her bike faster and farther each day.

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Grace needed it be. For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go forever dodging in and out of front of cars. As always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Grace was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life. More then often finding herself thinking about her life For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life  it felt as if she was living someone else’s life other then her own. 

But for now life for her was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked. Often finding herself dreaming of a life being on her own making her  own way in life on her bike.

Often finding herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride a trial where she was at the moment making her way through it. Gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Grace found herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she grew up in. 

She would often refer to it as Angels Ravine, For to anyone standing there could look as if they were looking out into a dream. A Ravine that seemed to go on forever over into the valley ahead. It was almost as if you was an Angel looking out from Heaven itself it was a quit place it was her place. Often finding herself there where she would come to often

But just on the other side of Angels Ravine, was a mountain trail that many bikers dared not to challenge. But not Grace for she knew one day that she would conquer that path, but unknowingly at the time. She would find herself with Hector and others in a challenge that they would never forget.

To relax, to think about her life thinking about her life growing up for she didn’t have any family or many friends. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself. But a couple of people who she find herself competing against if not in the city streets or here on one of the many trails. Grace found that life for her was there in the mountains with her bike outside of her hometown. But as the day grew long with Grace setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Grace loved riding at night under a starlit sky above her for being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky. For she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought to her but also kept a light on her. that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else’s. Finding herself later that night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

“If I am not me then who am I “

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself. While also thinking to herself who else would she tell for oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her. Having no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself.

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. There she would set listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain. Just as a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

Always being the same girl but in different places but never where Grace was never in the town that she grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams would come they would go,

 Waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in looking out of the window into the suns morning light realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Grace rushed out of her front door grabbing her bike on the way. knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets the only way she knew weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Grace that was her Life on her bike loose and fast racing with the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it’s many mountain trails. Finding herself telling passerby’s of many of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Grace herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Grace would refer to it by.

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like it was her own little piece of Heaven. But this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster than normal having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn’t wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Grace enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. 

But this time was different this day would be different, for a couple of days back a group of outsiders. A group that Grace had not seen in the area before, a group of young cocky bike riders. Had challenged Grace and Hector to a race, but not just any race a race down the other side of Angels Ravine.

With Grace and Hector arriving at the site first finding themselves setting there looking out over Angels Ravine. Setting there just enjoying the moment together talking about their time in the town together. The times they had racing one another through the streets, coming up here to mountains. 

 just laying there losing their selves in the moment laying there up under a star lit sky. 
But just before they could get lost in the moment again, the other group had arrived.

They had arrived ready to show their dominance on the mountain, but with Grace and Hector ready eager to show them other wise. 

The challenge was underway with Hector taking the lead first going down the steep incline, quickly followed by the outsiders, with Grace trailing but was soon to catch up. 

The trail was daunting with very steep inclines, as they raced along the mountain trail. But just as Hector was out in front one of the outsiders came up from behind him. Running purposefully close to him knocking him off balance sending him crashing off the trail. 

With Grace then stopping to check as Hector then motioned to her saying to her

“Go! Go get ‘em Grace! You got this!”

And with that it wasn’t too long before Grace had caught up to them, for Grace knew the trails like no other. 

Racing hard and fast to the finish side by side! Just as Grace then a hard look and smile to the outsider as she then pulled away. just the outsider went flying off of the trail! Leaving him setting there as Grace had won the race.

Later that evening Grace and Hector would spend the evening together, talking to each other. Talking about what may be store in the future for them as Hector then slowly looked to Grace just before giving her a kiss.

With Hector then saying goodbye to Grace as he then headed back to town leaving Grace there for the night.

As she came to the ravine Grace then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunrise and sunsets Grace had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with only a few words but just looking out into it. It was if time itself was coming to an end. Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Grace began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would her family be like? For as far back Grace could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she just woke up being in a place with the town and the people around her. But not as her family just people in her life a life that has seemingly went by all too fast. With the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Grace set there enjoying it as the last of its light would slowly disappear behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Grace laid there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. laying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. The same dream the same dream that Grace had so many times before. With the same girl the girl that Grace would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be from another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her for everything around her was different, different in the way she lived From the town that she lived in. But this time something happened that had never happened before. A name was said that had never been said before in the dream and that was name of the girl in her dreams someone called her Chloe. 

Suddenly waking up to the morning’s light putting her hands up to her head Grace just set there stunned. Thinking to herself on how real that dream was for unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there! I was her! Still visibly shaken as Grace looked around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Grace began to scream a calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man spoke saying

 “Hello Grace it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you” 

With a feeling of relief coming over Grace, Grace then replied with 

“Then why are you standing there looking at me! And how do you know my name?” 

“I know all about you Grace, I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek” 

With Grace then replying 

“Answers to what? What answers do I seek” 

“ Dreams, Grace your dreams.” 

As Grace just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Grace just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

“It is you Grace and it is not you”

More confused then ever Grace just replied by saying 

“Me! How” 

Just as the man then slowly approached Grace standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

“ In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life.”

“But now in this Life you are her and she is and you are not. For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life” 

with Grace then replying 

“Is this Heaven then and are you an Angel?” 

With a smile the man just simply said 

“ I am who I am! someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Grace! And this is your Life the Life that you ask for” 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Grace

 “The dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.” 

“For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now and what is to come for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have!”

“Now go and Live your Life Grace for Life is what has been granted to you” 

Just then as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Grace. Standing there looking out over Angels Ravine Grace couldn’t help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then memories of her dreams of the girl was now fading slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come a Life of whatever was to come for Grace. 

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now it was her town her home her Life. With Grace now leaving Angels Ravine making her way home finding her usual self racing to beat her own best time.

Grace finding herself making her way through once more through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. She was going to ride into Life into her Life Living a Life of what she made it.

We are a well established group looking to fill out our ranks a bit as we’ve been butting up against some scheduling beasts of late.  

**Who We Are**  
We’re predominantly an RP focused group. We tend to play more narratively driven games, but not exclusively. Over \~9 years we’ve played a number of different games, but gravitate toward systems like PbtA and FitD, but are open to other systems. That said, I’m the GM for the group and have largely moved away from 5E, we’re mostly using it to capture interest. Also, everyone in the group is at least a millennial, most of us elders, so if old references and stupid puns aren’t your bag, you may want to look elsewhere! 

**Who You Are**  
As stated, ideally, we’re looking for experienced players, preferably over the age of 25, if not 30.  Ideally, you’re experienced in other games/systems and **have interest in trying other games.** We generally enjoy world building, especially together, so if that’s you, please let us know! Obviously, an ability to show up consistently and on-time is necessary, the ability to communicate absences or tardiness is great, and a good mic and relatively quiet area would surely be appreciated. 

**The Plan**  
We’ll want to have a casual sit down chat (I like to call it a coffee chat, but I don’t drink coffee, you’re welcome to however!) to get to know prospective players before inviting them in. 

The plan here is to invite 1-2 players in for a campaign of Lost Mine of Phandelver (the original, not the updated version) to see about rightness of fit. Afterwards, if it's determined to be a good fit, we’ll pivot into a different game/system. 

**Scheduling/Mechanics of Play**  
We play every Saturday from 3pm EST to about 7pm EST. That time hasn’t changed in several years, and unfortunately there’s not an ability to shift it. We tend to play either on Roll20 or Foundry, and use Discord exclusively for voice. The group only plays with voice, no camera needed. 

**Other Things**  
Feel free to PM me or reply with questions, happy to answer what I can. Please don’t respond to this post with character ideas unless you really didn’t read it, or have some desire to greatly annoy strangers on the internet (which will result in your post being ignored). Respond to the post in whatever way you feel appropriate, ideally giving a sense of who you are (**name**, **age**, **pronouns**, etc.) and what you’re about (**likes**, **dislikes**, **hobbies**, etc.), that kind of thing.

1iya5xg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1iya5xg/fed_up_and_exhausted/,Fed up and exhausted,"Hey guys. I'm new to this sub. I was just looking for some support, and commiseration with everyone. 

I am a 33 year old woman, and my husband's parents moved in with us in 2022 a month before our first and only daughter was born. My FIL (74) got cancer during COVID, and hasn't been well enough to go back to work, and my MIL (67) lost her job over COVID and due to their physical health, going back to work isn't really in the cards for them.

They have been doing our child care, and it was going okay, but recently since we moved to a new house I feel like I am a full time maid, nanny, and care taker. Where we lived previously, my in laws had their own apartment on the property. We hoped to facilitate them having some independence, but it became clear while living there that they couldn't keep their own space clean, and were struggling to take care of themselves. So with the new house we moved them all the way in. We've been here almost 3 months.

I literally feel like from the second I wake up, until the moment I go to sleep I'm cleaning, doing laundry, cooking, and care taking. Both in laws are night owls and stay up until 3-5am. While he's awake FIL is literally in the kitchen constantly, and it takes him hours to cook basic meals because he can't stand or he forgets about it. He famously took 3 days to cook soup - it's part of the family lore now. I've come home several times and found the stove on/food burned/unattended and he's just so casual about it and doesn't see what the big deal is. I'm worried he's literally going to burn the house down, or the toddler is going to touch the stove and no one will take it seriously.

Neither is able to clean up after themselves, but they're very proud and get insulted if I ask them to ask for help with something, or if make observations about their competence/ability they get mad/flustered. Like I mentioned to my FIL yesterday that he needs to clean dishes with soap, and not just his hands and water. I literally have a tub in the sink that I keep with hot/soapy water. All they have to do is drop in what they can't wash. and I'll make sure it's rinsed an toss it in the washer, but they continue to clean things poorly and will not agree to any kind of system/assistance.  Like I would be happy  to cook eggs and toast for you, I can make it and clean up in probably 5 minutes, but it takes FIL 3 to 4 hours to prepare something like that - in which time I can't use the kitchen, he makes an enormous mess, and is unable to properly clean up afterwards. 

They absolutely destroyed the apartment at the old house by chain smoking in it, and the trash they left around cause a cockroach infestation. The apartment had to be treated, completely repainted with special paint, professionally cleaned, and have the mini-split replaced.  While we finally got a passable offer that we accepted... I can't help but feel like the damage done to their space has cost us tens of thousands of dollars because their apartment was almost not-recoverable. We asked them not to smoke it in, and they did anyway. Since we moved, they've tried to quit smoking, but I've caught my FIL smoking in the house (which is a HUGE NO from me, not with my toddler in the house) and he kept trying to hind it and lie about it. Earlier that day after he picked a fight with me because I didn't want to go get groceries when he wanted (we had a ton of food in the house, and unlimited clean filtered water), and turns out it was really about getting cigarettes. Like smoke if you want dude, you're a whole adult man, but don't pick a fight and guilt me into taking you to the store as a cover.  The next day he misplaced his carton, and pulled all of the trash out of the trash can in the back yard (which is full of dog feces), and our city dumpster, and left the trash strewn across the yard because he thought someone threw away his cigarettes, and then he blamed the dog. Sir, the 25lbs corgi with NO KNEES did not do that. He wont admit it or apologize, and I'm who cleaned it up. 

Their cat sprays, which has made our cats start spraying. And everything is now peed on constantly, I have cleaned up 4 pee spots just today. And the in laws either can't or wont follow my request to keep certain doors closed during the day so that the cats wont pee in my daughter's bedroom and on her bed. This has caused multiple trips to the vet  and costed close to $1,000 at this point to try to rule out different things. We're also going to have to replace the carpet if this continues.

And where is my husband in all of this might you ask? He is just generally unbothered, will huff and puff and do something if I micro-manage him but he really isn't helping carry the load.  He also isn't managing the bills, utilities, the sale or purchase of either home,  caring for his parents in the way they need, he's not been taking any pets to the vet to deal with the mountain of cat pee we now live on. I am not a house wife, house keeper, or a care taker of the elderly - this is not something I signed up for when his parents moved in or when we got married. I am exhausted and overstimulated. The cherry on top is my husband's disappointed little huffs and puffs about me not wanting to meet ""his needs"" after dealing with all of this in my own home, all day every day. It is making me so incredibly resentful towards him - and we didn't have this issue prior to his parents being here. Like I spend all day caring for Soldiers, family, finances, a toddler, multiple pets, and two old people. I'm constantly touching, being touched, or doing something emotionally difficult, technically difficult, managing disgusting tasks in and out of house,  and frankly I don't have anything left to give my husband at the end of the day.

  
I really really can't live like this much longer. Just today before leaving for work I had to clean the kitchen (last cleaned at 10ish PM) because there was no space/no materials to prepare food, my in laws are pissing me off but they still deserve a clean place to make their food. No help from my husband who leaves for work after me. I came home. Dog was in the garden (she digs up the irrigation system, and we've asked in laws to keep it closed - they don't). My daughter had no diaper on and she had peed on the floor (it was left there I don't think they noticed it), the dishwasher was full of dishes, the dish rack was full or dishes I had to rewash. Coffee, soda, food particles, trash was left out everywhere through out the house. Coffee dripped from coffee maker to everywhere in house. Their was cat pee in my daughter's closet because the door was not shut.  I just spent a good hour and half fixing up and cleaning all of that, and I locked myself in my office to take a call for work, and hop on here to calm down and vent. I already know the second I walk out of my office the house is going to look like a nuclear bomb went off.

My husband and I are both career-Army Officers. While my husband has been in longer, my career has been very much more successful, and I've found myself the family breadwinner. I am about to go into a really important job that is going to be very demanding of my time, and energy and I can't keep doing this on the Homefront. I can't be a field grade officer in the US military with these unmanaged pet, property, & family problems - it is absolutely humiliating. I'm very certain anyone who saw how my house looked and ran would be absolutely shocked and horrified.

I am losing my mind, and I need my husband to take more ownership of caring for his own parents. I am not even sure it's responsible to trust them with our toddler any more since they can't keep her space safe and clean. I need them to respect the house rules (which I don't think are crazy or unreasonable). I am seriously considering telling my husband I can't do it anymore and they either need to go to a home or I'm going to move out. I love my in laws. They're amazing people who have been through a lot. I don't want to abandon them and push them off to a home. The thought of it makes me feel so ashamed and guilty. I'm just so tired and I don't want this to ruin my marriage or daughter's childhood.

Teaching Italian verbs like *prendere* and *portare* can be a bit of a rodeo! I remember a time when one of my students, let's call him Marco, got tangled up in the difference. He wanted to say he'd ""taken"" a pizza, but ended up saying he ""brought"" it to himself. We had a good laugh, but it highlighted a common hiccup for learners.

In English, ""to take"" and ""to bring"" might feel like siblings, but in Italian, they're more like distant cousins. Here's a quick rundown:

1. **Direction Matters**: 
   - *Prendere* is about **grabbing** or **acquiring** something, like catching a train or grabbing a coffee.
   - *Portare* involves **moving** something to a destination, like bringing a bottle of wine to a party.

2. **Idiomatic Expressions**: 
   - *Prendere il sole* - to sunbathe (catch some rays, anyone?)
   - *Portare fortuna* - to bring good luck (like a lucky charm)

3. **Real-Life Scenarios**: 
   - Imagine you're in Italy and need to catch a train (*prendere* il treno) or bring a friend a gift (*portare* un regalo).

I’m in NO way affiliated with or associated with this group, but this is an amazing resource.


“You may have noticed our new T.W Curry Community Center sign, on our old but beautiful building, at 400 George Street, Sydney. Many of you though, may know this building from years ago as a car dealership, an ambulance service station, or a ladies clothing boutique that operated in the 90s. (Walk down memory lane)

That being said we got to thinking “how can we use this space to help the community in some way”? Well we understand, that for a long time, there has been lack of space available in our area, for nonprofit organizations & charitable groups. So the General Manager, Andrew Chapman said “let’s open our community center, to offer support they need.” Another reason we wanted to do this, was to show much appreciation for the support you have given to us, over the 100+ years of service, at our 5 locations within Cape Breton. 

𝑨 𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒕𝒍𝒆 𝒂𝒃𝒐𝒖𝒕 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝑻.𝑾 𝑪𝒖𝒓𝒓𝒚 𝑪𝒐𝒎𝒎𝒖𝒏𝒊𝒕𝒚 𝑪𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒓 𝒇𝒂𝒄𝒊𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚
There is no fee to use our building. The center is wheelchair accessible. It is approximately 600 square feet. It has a large table, and several chairs. There is also a smaller, quieter room with a sofa and a table and chairs. We do have other equipment available as well, like a projector & screens, upon request. There is also a spot for tea and coffee. 

To give you just a couple of examples of the many groups we have using our facility on a regular basis, would be the CNIB (Canadian National Institute for the Blind). Another important one that is lacking within our communities, is AA meetings. This offers the opportunity to meet in a safe environment, to support one another, and when help is needed the most! (We can provide you with the dates & times, if you would like to attend) 

So by all means, if you have a nonprofit organization and your group needs a place to meet, you are more than welcome to do so! To check for dates available & schedule your events, you can either call T.W Curry Parkview Chapel at (902) 539-3002 or Patten Funeral Home at (902) 849-7520

Don't love the freeways. I miss the outdoors and topography—until I was 18 lived in a very beautiful and green mountain city.

I currently live inside the loop near Rice U. and have organized my life to have coffee shops and restaurants close, with some walkability. I do like the diversity of Houston, the access to all kinds of culture, art, music, and food.

FWIW, I'm politically moderately left of center, not religious, and generally get along with everyone. For hobbies, I'm a musician, woodworker, and writer.

The problem I feel that I am having is that it is underextracting save for when I go really high on the amount of water, but then it gets too watery and eventually over extracted, but there is an overlap so I just can't seem to find the sweetspot. 

Ideally I'd like something in the range from an espresso to a lungo. So between 30-150ml or so. But in that range it's just sour all day long. 


Should I return it and get a Delonghi magnifica start instead?

I am 27F and my bf is 30M, we moved in to an apartment together and have 7 months left on a lease. 

TLDR - Over the last month I’ve had multiple conversations with my bf expressing my frustration with things he does that feel disrespectful/inattentive to me. Then on Saturday he blows up on me saying I’ve been neglecting him/not showing enough affection over the last few weeks. Is this manipulation? How can I be expected to be affectionate when I’ve been trying to explain to him why I’m struggling to be?

—-

Over the last month there were a few conversations where I shared my frustration over a lack of date nights and that he often ignores me for his phone or video games. I feel disrespected and it’s been hard to show the same level of affection and enthusiasm for my relationship. 

The last few days things have gotten kinda dark. Friday night was good with him, but I fell asleep on the couch and woke up to him rage cleaning. I keep the place pretty clean so I thought he was just mad that things weren’t as tidy as usual. He insisted nothing was wrong but couldn’t even look at me. It was so tense that I got so much physical anxiety that I had to leave and get a coffee until he left. 

Later, he comes home from his workout in a great mood and acts like nothing happened earlier. We get groceries and things were normal for a few hours. I end up asking him, “hey this morning seemed like something was up, I wanted to check in if you wanted to talk about anything?” And he immediately gets mad, and admits that he was mad/annoyed with me earlier. 

He said  “I don’t know what to say, I don’t want to talk about it, it’ll just make things worse”. Then he went to bedroom and wouldn’t talk to me. There was so much tension again that I went back to my car and sat there for 2 hours before he left again. Later that night, he calls me while he’s with friends and is being overly nice and giving me all these compliments. It feels like he’s playing a game with me. 

The next day, he comes home and sits at his desk huffing and puffing with his head in his hands at his desk. I didn’t say anything because it felt so passive aggressive. He ends up admitting that he is mad at me because I fell asleep on the couch and I haven’t been affectionate enough to him in the last few weeks. Even though I came to him multiple times to explain he’s doing things that are making it harder for me to be affectionate. 

Wtf y’all. Today he’s acting like everything is sunshine and roses but I am still uncomfortable about everything and can’t just flip a switch that everything is ok. I told him that his refusal to communicate with me and not telling me what was wrong for multiple days felt manipulative. But he essentially accused me of not trusting him and saying that I need to respect his boundaries/give him time to think?

1iy9nti,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1iy9nti/can_help_new_grad_candidate_harassed_by_senior/,[CAN] Help: New Grad Candidate Harassed by Senior Exec,"Basically, I was meeting with a senior executive from a bank to talk about my job application. He suggested dinner instead of a coffee chat. I did think dinner felt a bit too much, but since I’m a new grad, I figured maybe this was normal in the industry and didn’t question it.

But during the dinner, things got really uncomfortable. He kept bringing up how senior he was and said he could “guarantee” me a spot at the bank—bypassing the whole hiring process—even though I never asked for that. Then he started making inappropriate sexual comments and sexual request, and touched me after I had clearly said no. He also said some super humiliating things that were honestly disgusting. He asked me to go home with him but I refused.

It got so bad that people at nearby tables noticed. One of them even came over to ask if I needed help. So I do have witnesses. Plus, the table we sat at was right in front of a security camera, so there should be footage.

I’m currently seeing a therapist because it’s been messing with my mental health. There’s no way I could ever work in the same place as this person. And I honestly believe this wasn’t the first time he’s done something like this.

I want to report him to the bank, but I’m scared and have a few questions:
	1.	Will the bank actually take my report seriously since I wasn’t technically an employee, just an applicant? 
	2.	Could reporting this hurt my chances of getting hired in the future—either at this bank or elsewhere in the industry? I get that legally it shouldn’t, but I’d like to hear how things actually play out in real life.
	3.	If the bank doesn’t do anything, what other options do I have to hold him accountable?

I’ve been working so hard for this opportunity, and now this guy not only took away my chance at a fair process but also left me with trauma I’ll probably never forget. I feel like I need to do something—not just for myself, but also to make sure he doesn’t get away with it or hurt someone else.

Pros:


It's got a pretty funny story line. 


It's a lot faster to get through with a guide than what my play time shows.


It's a chill game you can relax with. 


It's a nice little change of pace compared to the normal games I play.




Cons:


It's all text based, no spoken dialogue, so if you're not a fan of reading everything, you might not want to give this one a go. 


It's all pixel art, so if that isn't your style of game, you might not like it. 



Conclusion:


I thought it was a very good game. I was not expecting the story to be all that good, but I was proven wrong. It's both funny and interesting.

What’s your everyday routine like?

They say life is made up of our everyday moments, not just the big events like vacations or special occasions. I find that so true, but sometimes I get a bit of FOMO since daily life can feel a little bland. So I’m curious, what does your typical weekday look like? And what’s the part of your day that excites you the most?

Here’s mine:

I wake up and try not to scroll through social media but honestly, most days I do end up browsing a bit. Then I freshen up, take my vitamins, and have a glass of water.

Next, I make myself a coffee and either settle down with a book, work on some self therapy, journaling or browse the web. If there are any bills to handle, I take care of them then, or I place an order for groceries. When I go to pick up the delivery, I sometimes chat with my neighbor for a bit.

I start my work-from-home job afterward, with meals in between. While working, I usually listen to podcasts—mostly on self-improvement or spiritual topics. During my breaks, I squeeze in some chores. One of my friends, who also works from home, sometimes calls me, and we chat while we work, which is always nice.

I wind down my day witha shower and my skincare routine, watch a show if I have time, and scroll through social media a bit more—usually for new recipes, outfit ideas, or fun little things like that. Sometimes, I’ll end the night with some reading by candlelight, which feels really calming.

And that’s pretty much my day!

1iy9j0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1iy9j0b/how_to_disappear/,How to disappear,"How to Disappear:

 
I just need a bit of a break. Weighed on scales, I’m not sure my current life should cost the same amount as my freedom. It’s been over four years since my last holiday. Every day, I wear the same loose-fitting white cotton shirt, its armpits slightly yellowed. Drink of coffee stale and only for caffeine. Drive the same roads neatly designed to cause stressful anger for everyone who leaves and starts at the same time. Pretend to look busy while making the same conversation about campaigns and ideas that will never come to fruition, but it makes us sound like we’re doing something! Drive home after the sunset with everyone else in the same positions pissing into traffic of our selfishness, I like to blame the urban planning. Eat not for taste but nutrition of whatever is left in my fridge from the last time I went shopping. Shit, man… I just want to get away for a bit, to camp somewhere remote with no signal, where I don’t have to hear my own voice spoken aloud. Where I don’t have to care what time, it is only that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. No gear, all an idea. 
 

I leave before sunrise. 
 
The city hums behind me, concrete monoliths producing a quiet buzzing for they do not sleep. You can rest when you’re dead. Artificial lights shuffling with shadow’s movements pacing beneath. 
 
I drive west, shaking like a dog taking a shit with excitement. Let’s call it just a weekend away, to myself. A place where the world does not insist upon itself for outside expectations. 
 
The air thickens with the sweating scent of dust and grass as I leave behind the oil and air-conditioning fluid-stained roads of the city. The horizon stretches wide with barren illusions, an invitation to relax. 
 
For now, I tell myself this is a journey, a pause to realign. But as the kilometres dissolve beneath my tires, I know this is something more— God, how nice would it be just to stay out here. An unravelling of what I was told life to be.
 
The road expands before me like a ribbon unwinding on a child’s birthday gift. Each pothole places more distance between who I was and who I am becoming. 
 
The best way to find solitude? Pick up a map. Look for a town at least three hours west of the coast. Make sure the road leading there looks like it was an afterthought. The more it looks like the road is haphazardly placed there the better, you want a town that has existed before anyone would want to visit it. Try not to look past the cluttering of buildings, if you have no expectations to what lies after you can’t be disappointed. 
 
The hum of the tyres against the asphalt is a lullaby. Birds stir as crimson cuts through navy clouds, their silhouettes sharp against the pastel sky, oblivious to my passing.
 
With each town I leave behind, the knot in my shoulders loosens. The buildings grow smaller, the roads quieter, the air richer with a scent I have almost forgotten—the aggressive, unfiltered breath of the earth. I lower my window and let the wind and minuscule debris attack my face.
 
I stop on the side of the road to stretch my legs, feeling the pulse of vastness beneath my feet. The landscape is both desolate and full, a mirage of scale. From a distance, just hazy lumps. Up close, a collection of eroded red rocks and minerals—each particle smaller than the freckles on my hands, yet together with such weight. Open expanse that does not ask for explanations, nor does it like to be. I trace the outline of distant hills with my gaze, wondering if I will reach them before I stop. Or if stopping would mean I got it all wrong.
 
Step One: Begin with the Road
 
To disappear is not to run, but to step deliberately away. The ones who run are chased; the ones who drift are forgotten. The roads have lost consistent maintenance now, a sign I’m on the right path. Each shoulder of the road crumbled of ancient ruins, deterioration meeting the coarse sand that laps at its boundaries. I’ve been driving for a handful of hours now – enough to where the engines rumblings have scratched at my eardrums. The ink-black mountains have appeared into colour of faded, wash green in the distance. A myriad of eyes wink across the desert floor as I pass with haste. Tethered to a polestar I’ve travelled west. 
 
Now’s about the time I’ve begun losing sight of radio towers. A giddy sweat rises on my skin as I slip further into a place where names mean less than presence. I stop at a roadhouse outside a maybe five building town, drinking coffee as white heat stains the sky. Truckers move shuffle and waddle past me, grizzled men of the highways, with sun damage only on the right of their faces, who see only a reflection, another shadow passing through.
 
The further I go, the less of my past remains. Towns become sparser; service stations less frequent, other cars cut through the heat waste, pale ghosts with the dust. I pass into the Outback, where roads stretch like growing pains of an elderly man. Here, the world is untamed. Seems like a remote enough spot for the relaxation I was deprived at home.
 
I stop more often now, pulling over to stare at the endless landscape. Kangaroos dart between shrubs in the dusk haze, and the land itself seems to breathe, exhaling waves of heat and silence. I think I’ll make camp here. Rising and setting of the screaming sun, perched upon the shallow gully with flowing fresh water at the bottom. A short hike from where I left my tether home.
 
Step Two: Erase the Footprint
How easy it is to check the little noise box sitting in my lap. In all honesty it hasn’t been that big of a distraction for my life, a rare message into a group chat, a joke between friends or a daily notification from an application I don’t use. The phone will not be missed. What I will miss is the ability to sell hours for quick scrolls that feels like a minute. 
 
Before my last signal fades, I delete the personalities—social media accounts, cloud backups, emails tied to obligations I no longer wish to recognise as mine. Now, if someone searches, they will find only a mutual mention, I’ve made up my mind I am to stay out here. I switch to aeroplane mode—no more searching for signal. Then, I shut it off completely. I can’t be fucked with any nonsense messages at this point.  
 
In a small town with no name, what’s the use of mine when I am only to pass through, no economy of conversation simply a list of supplies.
 
Step Three: Burn the Paper Trail
 
Out here money is irrelevant. 
I withdrew the skeletal remains of the little lifesavings I savoured over the years. Blackened carcass of my ‘work’ lay unmoving in the iridium sun. 
 
At a small bank outside a pub; distressed white weatherboards, an aluminium roof panting under the heat. I receive my paper. The teller, a woman, her eyes tired and red, holding the years of weight under them, offers no questions only a stern proof of identity. She cares not what I do. I leave with a vague thank you. No more need for proof. No address, no demotion to a series of numbers, no D.O.B. I couldn’t give two shits where they end up—best case, some kid finds them and has a fakie for a few good times.
I am still this night. About god damn time, truly no more reason to go back. 
 
Step Four: A Sudden Absence
 
Now’s about the time old friends and family will notice. Friends will assume I need space. Family will oscillate between worry and resignation. The more I seek, the more I am sought. 
 
I’ve moved on from my original camp now. I didn’t make the walk back to my car, I have no ideas as to what might’ve become of my beloved transport. In fact, I walked the exact opposite direction to what I knew to be of civilisation. From the direction I came, a fortress of debris and dust, pushing towards me, a convex bend into the clean heat. The disgruntled giant intermittently explodes with bright stabs of light bearing witness to the rusted clouds within. 
 
Before me, the pastel vermilion and navy sky danced and swayed with the lumps upon the level horizon. I know why I wanted to walk in this direction, I could never love another as much as I loved to be in solitude. Only now a manifestation of my commitment to this has destroyed my way back. It is enough.",1,1740527002.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False
1iy9i4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1iy9i4y/exs_grandmother_lied_about_liking_me_our_entire/,Ex’s Grandmother Lied About Liking Me Our Entire Relationship,"My ex (25M) and I (28F) broke up a little over a week ago. We were together almost 2 years. Due to financial circumstances, the lease and other related things we cannot move out of our apartment and have to continue living together. It was hard at first, but we managed to very effectively communicate and are being kind to one another. His immediate family adores me, and even still now that we are broken up they continue to check on me and make it clear they care about me. (I moved with him to his home state so he could go back to school and it's hard when I don't have my family here so it's nice to have people rooting for me.) 

Well, since we have broken up, come to find out, his grandmother apparently never liked me for absolutely baffling and unreal reasons. (He ended up telling me during a fit of anger that he has since apologized for.) I was completely shocked because for our entire relationship she was SO nice to me. We would talk over coffee, she told me her life story and I listened intently and was very engaged and asked questions and everything. When we were still together, she let my ex and I stay at her place over Thanksgiving and we watched football, talked and talked, and she even gave me so many of her vintage clothes and cookbooks. I was so appreciative and made sure to thank her and express my gratitude. I always greeted her kindly, asked how she was, and said goodbye as well. I always, always listened and conversated with her, which is something I really struggle with because I have social anxiety and austism. She would often offer me beverages and snacks, and a heating pad, which I just find so kind since I have sciatica issues. The grandfather was so incredibly sweet to me as well, telling me I was such a fine young lady. When my ex and I first got together, she actually told my ex the same, that I seemed very nice. Basically, absolutely NO reason to assume she disliked me. 

Now for context I have supported my ex for our entire relationship, both financially and emotionally. Encouraging him to seek help for his issues, and caring about his interests and his schooling. I really did try even though I was struggling myself but didn't have enough money for therapy. I know it might seem shitty on my ex's part but we've talked about it and he has apologized. But even with my own ex agreeing he messed up and his immediate family believing that as well, his grandmother has decided that *I* was the problem and that I was ""immature, acted 15, and had no agency for myself and that I was getting in my ex's way of success."" 

I was floored, confused, and devastated, to say the least. How in the world is it that this lady who was so nice to me, gave me her vintage clothes, let me stay in her house, and conversated with had decided I was the problem when I've done nothing but completely support her grandson who so obviously messed up? Of course no one is perfect, and of course I take my side of blame, but my ex even agreed he messed up and apologized for it. He even agreed the things she said weren't true. 

To be honest, out of everything else that happened during our breakup, finding out she disliked me hurt the most. I struggle with getting to know a partners family and I really, really tried to put my best foot forward this time. I loved him, and really wanted his family to like me. (My people with austism understand the trials and tribulations you go through trying to get people to understand and like you for you) 

& hey, I actually did succeed with my ex's parents and siblings, and I was so happy they liked me, but I guess not with his grandmother unfortunately. It just hurts and I don't understand. & some of you may be wondering ""why does it even matter if y'all are broken up now?"" & to be honest, you are right. It shouldn't matter, and really, it doesn't. But I just wanted to get this off my chest because it really, truly hurt me and blindsighted me. I'd like to add that my ex is his grandmothers ""favorite."" & I guess that just explains it all, doesn't it? 

I talked with my ex's sibling about how I was so confused and hurt, and they said to not take it personally, and that nothing she said was true. Even my ex's parents were upset with her about what she said. I'm happy to have people have my back, but nevertheless I am hurt and it will be hard to trust people in the future.   But I must carry on, regardless. 

Also, the vintage clothes the grandmother gave me...I feel uncomfortable having them now knowing what I now know. Should I give them back to the family, or should I just take them to a thrift store? Or should I just keep them since she did give them to me? I don't know. 

I intend to slowly distance myself from my ex's family because I don't want to cause drama. It's sad to think about but I think it's for the best. They are such kind people and truly want to help me and see me succeed, but I'd hate to cause a rift. I just want to heal, and get on with my life. ",1,1740526937.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

I know that this is a parenting sub, but I really need an advice as I really don't know how to react so I hope that this sub can be helpful :) 

So, I (24f) have been volunteering with a local special needs children for a few years now and everything has been great up until recently.

A week ago we were having our usual get together and there was this new girl (30f) that I have never seen before (this was her first time with us) so I introduced myself.

I can't pinpoint what condition she has as we haven't talked that much, but it's nothing too serious meaning she is highly functioning and verbal, unlike some of our other members.

So, as I said, everything went great. We all talked and joked around and at the end of our get together she told me that she liked me the most and then she showed her phone in my face and asked me to write my number so we can have coffee sometimes.

At that moment everything was fine as I'm totally okay with coffee now and then and she seemed pretty understanding when I told her that I have a lot of private stuff I'm dealing with but that I'm down for it and that we will arrange something this week when I'll be free.

She told me not to worry as she also has a lot of stuff to do and that she totally understands the situation.  

Our first few messages were completely normal, she texted me and said to let her know when I'll be free and I replied that I would need to see when I'll be available this week and then we can arrange something if she will be available then too.

After that everything just became too much for me to handle.

She started texting me non-stop, about some random stuff that she does at home like -Ohhh, I just washed the dishes, I just had a shower, I just watched the news or I'm sooo tired I'm going to bed now and so on...she blows up my phone CONSTANTLY.

She sends me lots of unrelated messages whole day, tells me she loves me (even tho we met just once and for about an hour) and she is constantly asking when we will go for that coffee even tho I said to her right away that I have a lot of stuff to do and that I need to see when I'll be available.

Don't get me wrong, nothing wrong with coffee or a walk or a get together, I was more than happy to do it, but her behaviour is really taking all my energy and I'm already all over the place as I'm dealing with a lot of other personal stuff that I don't have enough time for.

I have university exams (my final year so I'm under a lot of pressure), I've had few deaths in my family in short period of time and one of my close friends killed herself recently.
Also a lot of my close friends are going through something similar and I'm also trying to be there for them and to heal together through all of this, and countless other things that are taking a toll on me and my energy - don't worry, I'm very optimistic person and have a very positive outlook on life despite all that has happened, but this just all happened in short amount of time and I didn't get to process one thing, another thing hit me, so I need a bit of time for myself.

Also, I'm not very keen on texting in general with anybody as it's exhausting, especially constantly and when it is unrelated to anything so I'm also having problem with that, and this happens with everybody not just with her but this kind of behaviour is a little freking me out.

After all of this I don't know if we should go for that coffee as I'm scared that after that she would pressure me to go constantly and I just don't have time or energy to do that.

It is completely okay for me to grab a coffee once a week or so as that's how I do with some other members that I'm close with and that has worked great for all of us, but this is just too much for me and my mental health.

So dear readdit, can you please pleasee give me some advice what to do here or how to solve this.
I would really like to tell her that we can be friends but that this tempo is just not working for me and that I unfortunately don't have that kind of time for a relationship that she wants to have, but I'm really nervous to do it as I don't want to sound harsh and I don't want for her to get this the wrong way because I don't have a problem with her, just that I'm not ready for that kind of relationship with anybody.

What would you do in this situation? How can I say all of this without sounding harsh? 

I'm sorry once again if this is not a right sub for this, but I'm really desperate and it's killing me inside so every advice is welcomed!

1iy9hke,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDD/comments/1iy9hke/anyone_else/,...anyone else?,"Hi everyone, so I just met with a psychiatrist last week and he discussed symptoms associated with PMDD seem to match. However, I have yet to be diagnosed. 

I currently have SEVERE fatigue. As in I got maybe an hour of work done today because I kept falling asleep and it is debilitating. Moving, coffee, cold drinks, nothing helped at all. Also I am diagnosed with anxiety but the week before my period it goes absolutely haywire. Severe panic attacks usually happen then. Completely irrational thoughts, what feels like OCD. I also get weirdly short of breath on my periods and I feel like my asthma gets worse? 

I should mention my periods are so irregular that I can't track them. They're never the same, on average it's like...30-40 days, with the actual period lasting sometimes up to 10 days but usually 7-8. I cannot be on estrogen birth controls due to developing 2 adenomas on my liver and my body basically just stopping metabolizing the estrogen. About 7 years ago I had adhesions removed from my ovary but the kicker is that my doctor at the time never said if it was endometriosis? Idk maybe I have both...I'm in talks with my doctor to try to get this sorted out ASAP. 

I don't really know if there's a point to this post, I guess does anyone feel like they lose it a week before their period and then their actual period is a nightmare every single time? Are your periods irregular too? What things have you done to help with PMDD and/or Endo symptoms? Sorry guys just ranting but also looking for guidance wherever possible.

I cut him off. Weeks later, he begged, ""please talk to me"". I'm considering breaking up with him. I’ve been dating my boyfriend, Jeff, for 10 months. Our relationship has been amazing, and I see a future with him. But there’s one problem: his ex, Jenna. Jeff often talked about Jenna, his “best friend” and business partner when we started dating. He made it clear she was important. I later found old pictures of them looking very intimate, and her Instagram was full of him, with hashtags like #relationshipgoals. He never mentioned they had dated until I asked. They broke up a year and a half ago but stayed close. I met his friends and family early on, but not Jenna. Every time I was supposed to meet her, something happened—she left early, wasn’t there, or Jeff steered me away. The weirdest was three months ago. They hosted an open house, and I expected to help. Instead, Jeff dropped me off at a coffee shop, saying he’d pick me up later. Before I arrived, he texted that Jenna had a “family emergency.” Later, he admitted she had a panic attack about meeting me and left. Since then, she’s avoided me, even sitting outside a party texting Jeff to see if I was there. Now, Jeff and Jenna are on a two-week camping trip. She’s already posted five pictures of him.

As far as I understand, it creates more fines than higher tier grinders like the zp6 or k-ultra.

As far as ive figured it out, i need to decrease pours and agitation since i have more fines. Is that basically it?

Ive found that water off the boil has been working well, and grinding finer does add flavor, but any kind of agitation seems to stall my brew / overextract the coffee.

So in short it seems like Lance's 2 pour recipe with a coarser grind might be the way to go? I started off with it, but had some very mediocre cups, then went to Hoffman's recipe and now am slowly deciding to go back to less pours again.

And important question: do i stick with the J for my learning phase, or do i bite the bullet and get a better grinder?

1iy9flw,https://i.redd.it/raf9mqolfdle1.jpeg,Pi/USDT Technical Analysis 2/25/25 Intraday,"Brief technical analysis of the Pi/USDT chart shown.

 Please remember this is not financial advice—always do your own research and manage risk accordingly.



1. Price Action & Trend

Strong Intraday Rally: Building on our previous discussions, Pi/USDT has extended its bullish momentum, moving from around 1.40 to the 1.60 region. This ongoing uptrend reaffirms the positive bias noted earlier.

Current Price Zone: After reaching near 1.60, the price appears to be consolidating around 1.58–1.59. Such a pause or minor pullback is normal following a substantial intraday rise.



2. Moving Averages / Bands

The colored bands on the chart (similar to moving average envelopes or Bollinger bands) indicate that price is near or slightly above the midline. Trading near the upper band can signal short-term overbought conditions, and a move back toward the midline could offer a support or retracement area if the rally pauses.



3. RSI (Relative Strength Index)

The RSI (visible at the bottom) is currently hovering around 60–70, suggesting a moderately bullish to potentially overbought condition. If the RSI moves above 70, it typically signals overbought levels, whereas a drop below 50 could indicate fading momentum and a potential pullback.



4. Volume

Volume spikes have accompanied much of the upward move (from about 1.40 to near 1.60). Elevated buying volume on dips would confirm continued bullish interest. A noticeable drop in volume could hint that the rally is losing steam and may consolidate or pull back.



5. Support & Resistance

Immediate Support: Around 1.50–1.55 appears to be a short-term support zone, reflecting where buyers have recently stepped in. If price falls below 1.50, look to 1.45 or 1.40 as deeper support levels.

Resistance: The recent peak near 1.60 is near-term resistance. A clean break above 1.60—especially on strong volume—could open the door for a move toward 1.65 or higher.




6. Short-Term Outlook

Bullish Bias: As long as price remains above 1.50, the short-term uptrend remains intact.

Potential Pullback: After a ~15–20% move, a healthy retracement is common. Watch RSI and price behavior around 1.50–1.55 to see if buyers step in again.




Key Takeaways

1. Momentum remains bullish, but be mindful of overbought conditions near the upper band.


2. 1.50–1.55 is a critical short-term support—losing that level could prompt a deeper pullback toward 1.45 or 1.40.


3. A breakout above 1.60 on strong volume may continue the uptrend toward 1.65+.



Always remember that technical indicators are probabilistic, not guarantees. Combine them with fundamental insights and prudent risk management when making trading decisions.

1iy9fld,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1iy9fld/running_and_stomach_issues/,Running and Stomach Issues,"Are there any other runners out there with severely sensitive stomachs?

I recently got bilateral hip surgery so I have been out of running for a while, but am now building back into my training. In the past, I have run one marathon and was training for another when I was sidelined, so when I am healthy I find myself doing longer runs frequently.

Usually my stomach can handle about 5 miles before anything starts feeling funky. I tend to run in the mornings and will often wake up with a stomach ache, which never bodes well for my runs. I've tried eating dinner earlier, eating ""simple"" foods, waking up earlier to get some light movement in before a run ,etc. I also often get into a tough spot because when I'm training I get so hungry and want to be able to eat without having problems after.

Nothing seems to help consistently and I almost always find myself in a \~sh\*tty\~ spot when I'm a few miles in. I then will often deal with an upset stomach for hours after my workout. I've tried running in the evening, but this is always dicey because I never know how something I might have for lunch, a snack, coffee, etc. might bother my stomach throughout the day.

All of this to say - are there any other runners out there with these same issues? If so, have you been able to find any foods, supplements, routines, or other things that help you feel good during and after your runs? (No pun intended.)

If you didn’t/couldn’t/wouldn’t, here is a recap that has the rage if you provide the tapas, because according to Híláríá Baldwin, if we know someone who speaks Spanish, we’re from Spain.

I highly recommend the following reviews that amazing pepinos screenshot or pasted for ease of access based on the one episode that TLC released to major media outlets (usually they send multiple episodes to provide context and a story arc, interesting that didn’t happen here):

* [LA Times by Meredith Blake](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1iuy9hn/my_second_unpaywalled_gift_to_the_sub_the_la/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

If you’re new here, welcome! Here’s a bit of a heads up about my POV shared by many pepinos:

* Hilaria Baldwin was born Hillary Lynn Hayward-Thomas in Boston, MA. She is a white American woman literally descended from Mayflower passengers. Her father likes Latin America as well as Spain and Spanish culture and talks about *“not having an iota of Latin blood.”*
* She actively called herself Spanish. A lot.

[That 22&#37; España to New York is BOLD. ](https://preview.redd.it/zv7mqypx1dle1.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dbd6b6ace476a28a6468e189936d8f8ac264ef2)

* [Alec actively called her Spanish](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/q83t7q/compilation_alec_my_wife_is_from_spain_baldwin/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). A whole lot. As recently as 2022 (two years after her grift was revealed) Alec was telling New Mexico police hours after the shooting *“my wife is from Spain.”* The [receipts on this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/t2txld/specific_claims_alec_baldwin_made_about_hilaria/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) from u/ultimomono are spectacular.
* Bilingualism/multilingualism is fabulous. Not one person on this sub or anywhere I can find has ever had a problem with Hillary speaking two languages – that’s simply her piss poor straw man argument. The issue is that she appropriated Spanish culture, pretending to be an immigrant with a heavy (yet weirdly fluctuating) accent to make herself “exotic” and appealing to a clueless rich man.

**Alrighty! On with the recap:**

* The opening montage is set to classical music and quickly recaps Alec and Hillary’s early days, their many kids, and the Rust shooting. In case you didn’t know Hillary was a yoga teacher, it was mentioned 6 times in the 65-minute episode.

[She may not pose like this anymore, but the look what I can do energy is 100&#37; the same. ](https://preview.redd.it/q6tc3ggd2dle1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fcd8fface07f9b200f3d39750eaf0486e4d7629)

**Rafael’s 9th Birthday Party/Getting To Know The Baldwins**

* A title card with tasteful white letters on a black background informs us that we’re in *“Manhattan, NYC, Summer 2024”* with the typical NYC audio note of sirens and a fade to images of the city, including the Chrysler building and the outside of the Baldwins’ Greenwich Village apartment.
* The chaos of the city is mirrored in the chaos in the apartment where we see the many pictures that adorn almost every wall and surface (seriously, can someone psychoanalyze this choice?) as well as a child screaming in the background. Then we hear Hillary saying *“wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.”* If you’ve got to say it seven times, ma’am, you don’t have their attention. In a nutshell that was the whole episode: chaos and Hillary saying nothing yet too much.  
* Basically, all that is happening in this part of the show is that they’re frosting a cake, putting candles on it, and singing happy birthday to Rafa. Pyramids took less time to build. To be fair, they were also building context and background to make these people…endearing? Appealing? Funny?  Excruciating to watch.  
* Cut to a flashback clip of an entertainment show reporting on yet another kid *(“The Baldwin Bunch is growing again!”)* and Alec puttering around while explaining why they chose to have seven kids. He groused: *“I thought five was the outer limit, but they kept going.”* Freudian slip? *They* who? Like Hilz and the fertility clinic on speed dial kept implanting embryos? Do tell.  
* Hilz appears in the first “interview while seated on couch” of the episode. I’m ashamed to say I watch Sister Wives (feel very free to judge) and this is a standard part of these TLC shows where at most they do two interviews with two different outfits per episode. In this episode, Hillary had six interviews with different outfits. Being a rich executive producer is nice, no? She also is constantly curled up on the couch, never sitting with her feet on the floor because she’s yoga instructor, I’m sure.

[I like to think the carousel in the background is a subliminal message from a producer that this is a circus.](https://preview.redd.it/xr27nx1v4dle1.png?width=729&format=png&auto=webp&s=818f421ac5317f514bb656939ac691b192178aef)

* Hillary opens by telling about how fast she and Alec got married after meeting and the fact that he said (according to her), *“I need to have kids again, that is something I want to do.”*
* Cut to Carmen in shorts and a cropped tank top with her bra strap hanging out and a face full of makeup. Sigh.
* Shots fired at five (five!) minutes in: we see a clip of a home video of Carmen’s birth. Hillary is crying with actual tears and looking at her baby while saying *“no te preocupes, eh? Estás bien, estás bien/Don’t worry, eh? You’re fine, you’re fine.”*

[Still not Spanish no matter what you said to this baby. ](https://preview.redd.it/75ev9rx38dle1.png?width=475&format=png&auto=webp&s=b10a096affa7910b74a53c328bb25e2c0f5240ab)

* Hillary observes: *“I had just turned 27, I was really young but don’t think I’m telling you this because I regret it, I’m very happy”* with lots of finger wagging involved. The immediate quick cut to Alec making this face must have been intentional. If it wasn’t, it was an act of God.

[Faces of some happy people.](https://preview.redd.it/6wrqi53a8dle1.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=9461eef39781ccc02706c5ae42b73e74ff4b9299)

* We know the producers were mindful of playing nice with the Baldwins because when one asked Alec *“you and Hilaria didn’t set out to have seven kids?”* she went all in on pronouncing “Hilaria” in Spanish. Also, Alec said they didn’t plan on seven *“I never thought at my age, I mean holy moly.”* Did he forget about his insistence on having kids that Hillary shared in her interview?
* At about six minutes in we see a nanny in a striped shirt running after a kid behind Alec, who, frankly, isn’t as helpful as a father of seven ought to be. He holds Edu and tells him to burp then does his “actor laugh” (eyes squeezed shut/mouth wide open forced laugh), then shuffles around and shoots the shit with production.
* In a couple’s couch interview Hillary tells Alec *“People think that I married you for money, fame, glamour all of these things. Why I married you is because you’re a good-looking guy and you were a good-looking guy.”* That’s a thought to keep in your head, Hilz. Don’t let it out. Alec ribs her for saying *“you* *were* *a good-looking guy”* and she pushed back insisting she said it the way she did because she knew he would give her grief.
* In another interview/outfit she does say *“Can he be a curmudgeon? Absolutely. Can he be set in his ways? Absolutely. But you know what? I get to see the Alec who’s really fantastic. He’s funny, he’s kind, he’s handsome. He’s extraordinary intelligent and he’s so generous.”* She says this all pretty convincingly but keep this bit in mind when she describes her kids later.
* The *“Before I met Alec I was teaching yoga, mopping the floors, cleaning the mats, cleaning toilets and I was happy as a clam”* story Hillary tells is confusing bc according to her own 2016 book, she had an eating disorder and a discombobulated hip caused by compulsive exercising but, sure, she was a happy mess. Then along came Alec and they got married. They showed wedding pictures I’ve never seen before and Alec says *“I fell in love with her because she’s so special, I’ve never met anybody like her before.”*  Do you mean someone who pretends she is a whole made up ethnicity? Relatable.

https://preview.redd.it/kzxex4td8dle1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=732b9f42d05e0bae5e07ce1fb172ec34e1ec4d2c

* He goes on: “*she had what she had and she was happy then I sucked her into this filthy, disgusting world I’m in (actor laugh)…I think she’s less happy as a result of what we had to put up with.”* Whew, I need therapy after listening to them insist that they are happy, dammit! 

[Hillary in her happier days. Pre broken hip, one assumes.](https://preview.redd.it/1d7v87ri8dle1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e1a15b7e3a4b65bf7b2e9fbd464cb5589a117ca)

* Gold-digger narrative: they go for the gusto with a catchy doo-wop song about being a gold digger and talking about how Hillary is so much younger than Alec that people assumed that she was out to take his money. Hillary seems to agree that she understands that assumption but listen to how she phrases it: *“There are certain things I can understand…If I looked at a 27-year-old yoga instructor that was dating a 53-year-old rich and famous actor, what would I think?”* Girl, you said nothing. 

[So is TLC trolling us or Hilz with this wedding day fan picture? ](https://preview.redd.it/30ap0ygn8dle1.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=f52509000629f485755c41d3389bf3f7cbaf3702)

* Back to the birthday party where Hillary is slapping the cake together and telling the assembled kids *“Say good luck, mami.”* Carmen responds, *“good luck, mom.”* No one is calling you mami, Hilz.
* The frosting is a mess because they’re trying their darndest to be cute and kooky. Rafa says *“what the hell did you do to the cake?”* Alec responds, *“Jesus God help me.”* Hillary howls like it’s the funniest thing she’s ever heard, and I felt sad for their little boy.
* Hillary notes that *“the world very much misunderstands Alec, he’s a very tender soul, he’s very raw, especially now.”* You know who has a tender soul? Your son who should not have had any part of his birthday highjacked for your PR scheme.
* Then Alec receives a super conveniently timed phone call about the trial. He actually says *“yeah, I’ll look at the calendar…to travel…to go there yeah… to stand trial, yeah.”* Subtlety is not in his bag of tricks, apparently.
* Production literally allocated one minute to a summary of the Rust shooting:
   * The somber title card below
   * a strategic snippet if the 911 call where the crew member says *“two people were accidentally shot”* (this achieves showcasing the word “accidently” twice in one minute)
   * a picture of Halyna
   * the video of the moment Alec heard Halyna died
   * Hillary’s spin (which avoids having Alec say anything substantive): *“Watching Alec and his pain in no way is it meant to compare with Halyna’s loss, with her son who has no mom. It breaks my heart”* (looks up, no tears).

https://preview.redd.it/tdyseigu8dle1.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e446d82c8ee8cb8d2591288c0f48f499bdd6c28

* A voiceover says: *“Alec Baldwin is facing manslaughter charges, his trial begins in two weeks”* \- then back to the birthday party and Rafa asking *“can we do this quicker?”* while Alec tells she who shall not be named (Baby Ilaria) *“come here Baby, no, no, no, come, aqui.”* She wisely ignores him.
* Alec intones *“my one overriding concern \[is\] letting seven children know that I love them…I’m 66 years old and I’ve got seven kids. And once you hit 50 everything is I’m old, but you have no time to waste. I’m worried.”* Great to hear that Halyna’s family is not remotely a concern.
* Poor Raf looks genuinely overwhelmed as the piñata is brought out (but the Spanish pronunciation of the word *piñata* is not brought out by any of the kids yelling the word) and the first commercial break saves me from throwing the remote at the TV.
* **Contrived Show Narrative #1: Alec and Hillary are HAPPY and don’t you dare question that. They also love the utter chaos they live in. Reality: the nannies and assistants do most of the heavy lifting and it’s a safe bet they hate the chaos.**

**Haircuts for Alec and Sons**

* Alec is cleaning up the huge mess made by his wife and kids and Hillary lets us know that Alec has it rough (‘cause this is all about Alec, amigos): *“Alec has OCD and people throw the term OCD around very casually…OCD is a real thing that’s really hard.”*
* The producer interviewing Hilz says *“I imagine that having 7 kids and 8 animals is an interesting combination with OCD.”* Hillary looks a little sour and deadass responds with a straight face, “*Yes, it was a curious choice that he made.”* This lady is not well, y’all.

[What giving zeros fucks look like.](https://preview.redd.it/tu2dn79y8dle1.png?width=334&format=png&auto=webp&s=b423a40f10bc89ab15fe3455b392fc3592bd2c3c)

* Hillary and Alec take their sons to get haircuts and Hillary’s scintillating commentary is: *“In New York, I love just being out.”*   As their outing in one of the greatest cities in the world they choose...the barbershop. M’kay. Clearly leaning into the “simple family pleasures” bit. Never mind that Alec is dissolving into a puddle of sweat and the guys they walk by say “that’s Alec Baldwin” but the rest it cut off – what I wouldn’t give to know what else they said.

[That audio cut off fast after that line.](https://preview.redd.it/k51ilf5b9dle1.png?width=383&format=png&auto=webp&s=94049974c9e8292a1e4a30c5b015b2147a9c30ee)

* Hilz adds *“The past few years have been the hardest and most complicated that we have yet to experience”* (that’s not how English works but do you, sweetie).  She points out *“we’ve been very focused on routine. Humans are routine people. We need to have things that we love and enjoy and need, especially during very difficult times.”*  Maybe this is the wisdom she’ll offer up in her new book. Can’t wait.
* Apparently, Carmen chose haircuts for all her brothers and sent pix to Hillary who then informs the boys, *“this is the haircut Carmen picked for you.”* Sigh.
* Because watching Alec and his kids get haircuts while Hillary talks endlessly and gets in the way is just as devastatingly boring as it sounds, the producers cut to a couch interview where Alec asks Hillary to name one word that comes to mind for each of their kids. Gird your loins:
   * Raf: *so funny* (Hilz)/ does an imitation (Alec)
   * Leo: *sweet* (Hilz)/*beautiful* (Alec)
   * Romeo: *he knows he’s cute* (Hilz)/ *spunky* plus an imitation (Alec)
   * Edu: *smooshy* (Hilz, but Alec complains all her words are “soft”)/ *horse* (Alec, but Hillary says “that’s a stupid word”)
* Carmen didn’t send a haircut pic for Alec, so Hillary calls to tell her to send one and Carmen sends a picture of a young Alec. When Hillary shows Alec, he immediately says, *“1989, that’s from Red October.”* She replies, *“how old was I in ’89, five?”* He responds matter-of-factly, “*you were 5 years old. Your parents left you with a babysitter and they went to go see the movie.”* Hillary nods in agreement.

[OF COURSE she selected a childhood picture with her Spanish beanie. This broad. ](https://preview.redd.it/ngs8mbvg9dle1.png?width=581&format=png&auto=webp&s=008de48ada9755d7f9b77b51bb8c382e028eb0db)

* Get ready for some Mallorcan Math from Hillary: *“Alec and I are 26 years apart. It’s something that people focus on a lot. I don’t believe that age is just a number. He was very different when he was 26 years younger, and I’ll probably be very different when I am 26 years older. And I think if you respect that, and you see your person where they are, see it for what it is, and then see if it works and obviously it does for us.”* What in the Manchego cheese is this logic??? At this point (minute 24) I seriously regretted my decision to recap.
* They make inane chit chat about the summer in the barber shop and Alec mentions they’ll have to get a new car which leads to Hilz saying she’s a great driver as Alec laughs. Hillary asks Raf *“who’s a better driver, mommy or daddy?”* He looks mortified initially, but then smiles slowly and responds, *“you both kind of suck.”* Alec laughs, claps, and says *“line of the day.”* While Raf’s statement is objectively true, they’re just teaching their kid to go for the shock value.
* Suddenly Hillary forgets her grift is grounded in Spain and takes a quick detour to the Caribbean. She says in a vaguely Cuban accent to Raf *“oye, calvito/hey, baldy”* and everything in my spirit rebelled. I rebuke you in the name of Santa Celia Cruz, get thee behind me Hillary Lynn!
* Alec sings the Lollipop Guild song from The Wizard of Oz to describe his kids. Hilz takes post haircut pictures and Alec tells his boys – twice! – *“Marci Klein taught me this \[modeling pose\].”* Sir, your offspring do not care that Calvin Klein’s daughter taught you a durn thing.  

**Getting Ready to Load Everybody and Everything in Cars to go to The Hamptons**

* Back to the terrible word association bit about their kids, this time about the girls:
   * Carmen: *she started talking when she was 5 ½  months, like literally talking and hasn’t stopped since…she’s literally Boss Baby* (Hilz)/ *sophisticated* (Alec). Cut to Carmen in a messy bun and Alec asking her what she calls that hairstyle. She responds *“I call it the butt cheek bun because…”* He says *“let’s take that again Carmen, ok let’s start again, what I call it, Carmen, is the dead raccoon.”* She shoots back *“you’re just sad cuz you’re balding.”* Just a thought, Zander, more parenting and less stage directing.
   * Lulu: *we call her La Vikinga, The Viking* (Hilz)/ *she’s like a flower to me… the word is radiant* (Alec). Hillary interrupts with hand motions near Alec’s face “*what is that flower that eats things?”* Alec *“Venus Flytrap? She’s not a Venus Flytrap”* while Hilz nods vigorously.
   * The Baby/She Who Shall Not Be Named: *the baby is a monster… I got bit today then she dug her nails into me* (Hilz)/ *Baby monster* (Alec). Cut to Alec asking, *“where’s the baby”* and Hillary in full I came to this country at 19 mode: *“she helping me to catch cats.”*  Full cuckoo clock accent.
*  Fun fact about Hillary: after 11 years and 7 children, she still has no clue how to parent effectively. She recruits Carmen aka her assistant/confidant/ parent #3 to help her design a seating chart for the car ride to the Hamptons which they have presumably done a whole bunch of times. According to Hillary’s Mallorcan Math, she has “7 kids, 4 dogs, 4 cats, 2 nannies, and a husband” to fit into two cars. Later she says “*17 beings”* so who knows who was left wandering around Manhattan.
* During a couple’s couch interview Alec observes, “*you know when I love you the best? You know when I love you the most?”* Hillary whispers *“when I go to sleep”* Alec continues, *“when you’re asleep.”* Hillary gives him the finger and he says *“I love you when you’re sleeping, did you just do that to me?* (meaning giving him the finger). He shakes his head comically at the camera. We’re on to the next thing!
* The next thing is a doozy: as Alec is sitting and petting a little dog talking about how he realized – in 1983 – that he was severely allergic to cats. Alec shares: *“I said to my wife we can’t have cats, ever. We can’t have cats. She goes out and buys four cats. Four.”* Simultaneously Hillary was filmed in tight closeup looking at the camera, smirking while she makes her stupid seating chart for the car ride and saying *“I’m gonna hide all the animals in his car.”* There’s no way their kids will make it to adulthood without major issues.

[The man was literally saying he had to get an epinephrine shot for his cat allergy years ago and she planned to have him drive 3 hours with the cats.](https://preview.redd.it/38hy9e4o9dle1.png?width=443&format=png&auto=webp&s=085412a56895547f06a7a27698d7588b6b5933c7)

* Amongst all the kids jumping on couches and screaming, Alec continuously tries to give ideas for who should travel where and there was an enlightening exchange between them:
   * Alec: *“There was a point, probably after we had our fifth kid, Eduardo, she changed, and she started calling all the shots. And then all of a sudden one day she just made the decision it was easier for her, whatever I’d say she’d go, no!” (*Speaking to Hillary) *“you and I used to be more collaborative, I’d say, we’d argue we’d discuss, we’d come to some accommodation about what we were going to do, how we were going to live our life and then one day you kind of changed”* (could that day have been December 21, 2020?) *“And no matter what I said you were like, no, here’s what we’re going to do! And you changed.”*
   * Hillary (pursed lips, squinting, leaning forward impatiently waiting her turn): *“No, no, no, no, no. I guess I agree that that’s your reality of it*” (Alec tries to stare into the camera incredulously but it was the wrong camera) *“what I would do is I would say yes the I would do whatever I wanted and I would just keep it from you…”*
   * Alec: *“you’d gaslight me”* (BREAKTHROUGH?)
   * Hillary (smiling): *“No, no, no, no”*

·        

[When Hillary hears an inconvenient truth, this face is her tell.](https://preview.redd.it/10dhe2lz9dle1.png?width=348&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9cebf039145bdb33d93b8b69b54ae88686fa2e3)

* I’d like to note here that this was the third time in the episode Alec mentioned that after the fifth kid, things shifted. The fifth kid roughly coincided with, you guessed it, the big reveal of Hillary’s grift.
* **Then they awkwardly transition to the part that I was waiting for: the oh so brief discussion of Hillary’s fake accent. One minute they’re in the dining room talking about Hillary’s control issues, then they’re back to a couple’s couch interview interrupting the hell out of each other so it wasn’t easy to follow but here goes:**
   * **Alec:** ***“After my first marriage, I said let’s have a prenup - ”***
   * **Hillary:** ***“I don’t want to think about that –“***
   * **Alec:** ***“She wasn’t happy about it”***
   * **Hillary (angry finger waving):** ***“No, no -”***
   * **Alec:** ***“It’s an awkward thing –”***
   * **Hillary:** ***“I just don’t understand – it is awkward – but I don’t actually quite understand what a prenup is because you’re like after a certain number of kids, it’s this, and after, and I was like you know what, I’ll just sign it,*** **(CUE ACCENT AND TALKING 100 MPH)** ***which was probably very stupid of me back then, now I’d read it again (Alec sist up abruptly as subtitles kick in) but like I just, I won’t sign it I just don’t really wanna think about the end by the beginning, and then you’re like, yeah I don’t wanna do it either…”***
   * **Alec:** ***“Let’s talk slower, let’s talk slower, you’re speaking English in a Spanish cadence and that’s always perilous for me. Slow down just a kiss, I can’t understand you.”*** **WELL HOT DAMN.**  

[What would she have said if Alec didn't muzzle her?](https://preview.redd.it/ml34delaadle1.png?width=584&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f22d04c5355bb9f4bd560f093deadf4fd5407e3)

* Here we go to education from u/quetedigo_redux: *“One of my theories is that the accent lives where the lies live, and it comes out when she's being dishonest or deceptive.”* On. Point.
* TLC and executive producers Alec and Hillary chose to spin her grift like this: the issue is Hilaria has an accent that people just don’t understand. It’s about the way she talks, not about the way she appropriated an entire culture and lied directly and by omission, stating she was from Spain to appear “spicier” or more “exotic.”  
* Over light Spanish guitar music, TLC frames the narrative in this package:
   * Two headlines flash: *“Unpacking the Media Frenzy Around Hilaria Baldwin’s Accent”* and “What’s the Deal with Hilaria Baldwin’s ‘Spanish’ Accent?” Fells like Hilz chose the first one and TLC the second one.  
   * Social media comments: *“I don’t understand why she has an accent. Isn’t she American??”* and *“I’ve become obsessed with the Hilaria Baldwin story. I’m so down the rabbit hole it’s ridiculous”*
   * Clip from a show with the host saying: *“Ok we need to talk about Hilaria Baldwin’s accent. People are finding clips where she goes in and out of her accent! It’s getting people riled.”*
   * Clips of Hillary speaking Spanish to her kids: *“Eduardo Pau Lucas, Edu, Edu”* and *“Gatitos, ¿dónde están los gatos?”*
* Then comes Hillary’s time to shine, and honey, she has REHEARSED. She’s focused, smiling defiantly, hitting her talking points:  
   * *“I’m raising my kids to be bilingual. I was raised bilingual”* Shift to picture of Hillary, her brother, her nephew, and her father in Spain around 10 years ago. *“My family, all my, my nuclear family now lives over in Spain.”*  Shift to her talking to kids in both languages *“ok, Toti (Edu), siéntate aquí (sit here), no it looks so nice”*
   * *“I want to teach my kids pride in speaking more than one language. I think just growing up and speaking two languages is extremely (pause) special. I love English, I also love Spanish, and when I mix the two it doesn't make me inauthentic* (aggressively) *and when I mix the two, that makes me normal*.”
   * *“I'd be lying if I said \[the controversy\] didn't make me sad and it didn't hurt and it didn't put me in dark places.""*
   * *""But it was my family, my friends, my community who speak multiple languages, who have belonged in multiple places and realize that we are a mix of all these different things”* (shift to a picture of Alec, her lost Spanish BFF , Hillary, and two other people from about 12 years ago.“) *“and that’s going to have an impact on how we sound and an impact on how we articulate things and the words that we choose and our mannerisms. That's normal. That’s called being human.”*
   * Clip of her talking to cat: *“No Capuchina, no seas así, ok, vamos.”*
   * Aaaaand, scene. Welp, smug and calculated appears to be Hillary’s new brand.

[Hilz knows some Spaniards and went to Spain a few times, thanks TLC. ](https://preview.redd.it/tpzcji6iadle1.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=e49c61f0332b854a6b2bc847e6b4b748c4aa35f6)

* To move the narrative, such as it is, along, the title card lets the audience know the family is two hours behind schedule they’re still trying to get everybody out of the apartment and into two cars that are double parked, according to Alec. Alec tries nicely to move things along, Hillary laughingly says to him, *“I love when you talk to me like that, it’s so passive aggressive!”* The man is a toad but he kinda has a point, lady.  
* As kids are running around getting no directions (or vague ones like *“there’s a mountain of socks, pick some”),* Hillary observes, *“with seven kids, routine is vital”* WHAT routine, you lunatic?
* Once they are finally downstairs, she complains, *“I hate going places with all 7 kids, I hate it, it’s so difficult”* um, bc you literally have no routine. If you did, two kids wouldn’t sobbing in frustration and Alec and Nanny Paola (who gets a 1 second caption) wouldn’t be standing around waiting for directions.
*  Interminable scene of getting kids, pets, and car seats organized where Hillary actually has the nerve to say, *“where is Rafa?”* in a vaguely interested way. Like a whole kid is unaccounted for, you’d think she’d be a tad more invested.
* A producer asks Hillary during a couch interview from the Hamptons (so after the travel is done):
   * Producer: *“do you remember what Alec’s only request was for the car?*
   * Hillary: *“No”*
   * Producer *“he just wanted to make sure he wasn’t in the car with any cats”*
   * Hillary: *“Oh. Did I put any cats in the car?”*
   * Producer: *“he was in a car with three cats.”*
   * Hillary tosses head back and cracks up.
* **Contrived Narrative for the Show #2: Hillary is just a bilingual super mami who casually speaks Spanish and English and that’s normal and lovely. Reality: she’s bilingual and uses different accents in both languages for attention and that’s 100% abnormal and offensive.**  

**Finally in the Hamptons**

* Hillary gives viewers an explanation of the summers in the Hamptons.
* We get footage of them driving with more of Carmen being parentified as she monitors how loud her brother can be because the baby is sleeping.
* Hillary calls Alec and he says, *“I’m trying to get to the house and unload everything quickly, but more importantly how are you feeling?”* Her accent when she says *“Manhattan”* as part of her answer is hard to describe but trust me when I say it’s how many Latino Spanish-speaking people say it.
* Romeo asks, *“why is Carmen not going to camp?”* In the barbershop scene Hillary and Alec had a whole boring conversation about how great it was that six kids were going to camp and only Baby Ilaria would be home. But who cares. Hilary replies *“Carmen is her own little independent woman.”* Carmen says, *“I was born an adult.”* Hillary affirms, *“you* *were* *born an adult!”* and laughs.
* They get to the house, and it’s beautiful, especially in contrast to their NYC apartment stuffed with piles of things and way too many pictures. Hillary says that Alec has had the house for about 40 years. I would not be surprised if their attempt to sell it becomes a plot point about how hard giving it up would be for Alec.  We see the horses, the pool, the grounds, and a giant pee stain on the rug. Nice work, TLC.

[What's worse, pet pee or the \\""art\\""?](https://preview.redd.it/et4hsk2uadle1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=206bd13af7c6294c665bd44fbc12fea14d45dcc8)

* Hillary and Alec have a conversation in their kitchen meant to convey how hard the impending Rust trial has been for them, because obviously everything is about their feelings.  As they talk, Alec gets the ice for coffee they will make and fixes a few things in there. Hillary’s voice over explains that Alec’s OCD *“manifests itself in many many different ways”* and that Alec’s OCD has been getting worse because he’s under so much stress as the trail approaches. We see shots of Alec organizing shoes, toys, drinks, and goggles. Hillary lets the audience know that Alec has been diagnosed with PTSD and has been in a dark place. Well, it’s not so dark that he got off social media or anything, but you get the idea.
* This lends itself well to coverage leading up to the Rust trail with a white on black title card that announces, *“10 days until the trial.”* This where Hillary delivers her now infamous assessment that “*Halyna lost her life in the most unthinkable tragedy, a son lost his mom. We are going to feel and carry this pain forever. This will be a part of our family story.”* I cannot.
* Back in the kitchen Hilz lounges and poses in a cropped white top and denim shorts and delivers a disjointed monologue about how hard things have been for them. Alec looks glazed and when it’s time for him to respond, he takes a beat too long bc what did she just say and ultimately lands on *“This has been just surreal, I mean, I can't even believe that we're going through this, and I always feel more in pain about you than me, because I think to myself, ‘Well, I'm going to try to my best to just get through it,’ and I think what it's done to you and how much it's hurt you and everything…Honestly, from the bottom of my soul, I don't know where I'd be if I didn't have you and these kids going through this — I never would have made it with this. Sometimes I'd say, ‘Why did I have seven kids? Why do we have seven kids?’ And I realize, to help carry me and you through this situation.”*
* In full accent Hillary declares *“we wanna gif our keeds a naice summer”* and they have a giant water slide set up for them. We get a glimpse of the nanny that went with them to New Mexico in the yard helping a kid. Hilz rocks a conservative (for her) bikini, and they have a grand time as Alec goes down the slide yelling *“I’m gonna freeze my balls off!”* There you have it in case you wonder why the kids talk like they do.
* All the fun outdoorsy stuff is weirdly interspersed with Hillary sharing that they’re putting on a united brave front for the kids but. *“It’s extraordinarily difficult when you feel so horrible inside and so scared and confused. Because you have this constant nausea here* (points to her stomach*) the panic, the inability to sleep.”*
* Finally, Alec intones *“I know this is a cliché but a child should have a childhood. They should have a period of time where that don’t have to think about certain things. And I am very nervous about that. You just live one day at a time.”* As I watched this my mouth dropped open. Andros Hutchins doesn’t have the luxury of “not thinking about certain things,” Alec. Droning on about your kids when that child no longer has his mother is vile.
* Hillary: *“if I don’t bring him back from New Mexico, what are we supposed to do?”* Of course, there’s no dramatic tension because we know the outcome, so this is all just an extended pitch to win public sympathy, which has tanked on eepisode in, so there's the silver lining.
* **Contrived Show Narrative #3: Alec has OCD and PTSD and it is only by the grace of Hillary’s strength that he survives. Reality: they’re not particularly kind to each other but realize if one goes down, so does the other.**

Why Coffee Stains Your Teeth

Coffee contains powerful chromogens - pigmented molecules that easily attach to tooth enamel. These compounds create stubborn stains that can quickly transform white teeth into a less appealing yellowish or brownish hue. The acidic nature of coffee also weakens tooth enamel, making it more susceptible to discoloration and staining.

Key Factors Contributing to Coffee Stains:
- High tannin content
- Acidic pH levels
- Microscopic tooth enamel texture
- Frequency of coffee consumption

1iy8ynp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1iy8ynp/hes_spiraling_after_leaving_me_but_im_thriving/,He’s spiraling after leaving me but I’m thriving :),"I 20f had dated this boy (19) for a year and a half now and admittedly I come from a lot of issues with neglect, abandonment etc so in the beginning after I spent my whole life without attention and love I clung onto him really hard, he gave up a lot for me and inspired me to seek treatment for my issues and become a better me. Now I love this boy but oh my GOD could he never communicated, he always held things in and never spoke his mind despite me siting him down atleast once a month for a serious talk that he could talk to me openly and I would listen but it NEVER worked and he would hold it in until he exploded and I was the one who took the damage. He’s broken up with me a total of 3 times now, the first two times were due to him struggling mentally (he has depression, anxiety, adhd) and the stress of college and he didn’t feel like he deserved to be loved and pushed everyone away and I saw that from a mile away and told him that I understood and that I would be there if he ever needed anyone and I reached out to his friends to hang out with him more. During our “break up” we still did couple things just didn’t hang out 24/7, he still said he loved me, cuddled me, slept with me etc and then we got back together but like always I told him he needed to communicate with me. Flash forward to our second break up and suddenly I don’t give him enough alone time, to be fair he was right but I never knew he wanted alone time, he never expressed needing space just bottled it up and smiled then broke up with me for a second time. Line before during our break up he still wanted to do all the relationship things with me but wanted to be alone more, okay, we compromise and get back together once again telling him he needs to tell me how he feels our else I won’t understand. 
So our final break up, he breaks up with me 2 days before Valentine’s Day and 4 days before my 20th birthday out of nowhere and not even an hour before we were looking at apartments to move into, obviously I was heart broken and didn’t understand why and he said “ we never met in the middle” when once again he didn’t fucking communicate with me EVER. I put so much effort and cannibalized myself to become a better person so I could love him whole heartedly but he wouldn’t even take meds or get help for his issues, I love this boy so much and he even tried to tell me that he didn’t wanna see me move on but didn’t want to make it work, too bad I’ve learned to love myself more and not put so much energy into someone who won’t do the same for me but most importantly themself. 
It’s been a few days without him, I still live with his family just in a separate room and his family loves me and doesn’t want me to leave and I love them too. But I’ve just been so AT PEACE, I go to cute coffee shops, I get cute candles, I’m just so light and positive not giving a fuck about him or his mental health; he’s entirely spiraling and promised me to get sober the night he broke up with me but couldn’t even go one day without drinking, he’s isolated himself from his friends and I just couldn’t care fucking less and that makes me beyond happy, I don’t care if that makes me toxic or not I spent so much time trying for this boy and he took it for granted.

1iy8wvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iy8wvz/my_brother_has_always_wanted_to_prove_that_god/,My brother has always wanted to prove that God doesn’t exist.,"“I’ve done it, Michael,” he triumphantly announced last night.

He hadn’t.

As we would learn by the end of the evening, Jack had achieved quite the opposite. And for that, we would both pay.

“Come again?” I asked, lifting my eyes from the phone screen.

My brother sank deeply into his squeaking armchair, blank gaze fixed to the wall ahead—fixed to anything but me. His profile swam in a shallow pool of orange cast by the table lamp beside him. The lounge felt darker at that moment. It was only around six in the evening; only minutes earlier, the lamp’s glow had cut far more cleanly through the shadows of the room.

The dark was taking the light. It was infesting the brightness and safety of the room with its ever-growing tendrils.

Tendrils that were reaching towards us.

These are observations that I have only digested upon reflection, as I was never one for magical thinking. Never one for spirits. Never one for religion. At the time, my rational mind simply compartmentalised my doubt—my thoughts on the living room’s disjointed ambience. Instead, I let bemused thoughts reign in my mind.

“Jack,” I pressed, failing to contain my laughter. “Did you just say what I—”

“Yes,” he interrupted. “You heard me correctly. I’ve proved that there is no God.”

I grinned. “Which God?”

“*All* of them,” he replied.

I always told my brother that I shared his belief. That I was too rational to believe in spiritual or religious concepts.

However, he always asserted that this wasn’t enough.

In our youth, he once said, “I’m not talking about belief. I’m talking about proof.”

“There is no way of disproving God,” I pointed out. “Nobody’s proved his existence, so how on Earth would you *disprove* him?”

Most people plaster religion over their anxious wounds; it’s a source of comfort for them. For Jack, it was always the opposite. He sought to disprove religions—all religions.

To my brother, there was nothing more terrifying than the possibility of a deity, or *multiple deities*.

“There shouldn’t exist anything that powerful,” he said. “Doesn’t it scare you, Michael—the idea of something far greater than us?”

I shrugged. “I just don’t think you should waste your life on this. It’s an obsession, Jack.”

At this point, in our teenage years, he’d already wasted eighteen years on the pursuit—and *I’d* wasted twelve years listening to him prattle tirelessly about the subject. I truly believed this holy, or unholy, mission would plague him until his dying day.

But then last night brought an unexpected development.

My 38-year-old brother proclaimed that he had achieved something impossible—something no other human had achieved in all of recorded history.

Now, Jack is an incredibly intelligent man. He works for the United Kingdom Space Agency. But he’s hardly a once-in-a-generation genius. And neither am I, for that matter. I’m a biology lecturer. But we’re both scientists.

Both smart enough, I should say, to be skeptical about such a historical claim.

“Explain,” I said. “How have you proved that God doesn’t exist—that *no* Gods exist?”

Jack cast his eyes downwards, still not meeting my gaze, and replied, “If you’re expecting a 50-page thesis with tried and tested experiments, you’ll be sorely disappointed.”

“So if you haven’t proved it with science, then what?” I said. “If you start preaching about the evidence of God in the majesty of nature, I’m going to mentally tune out, so—”

“Will you stop yapping?” asked Jack. “I didn’t say I hadn’t proved it with science… There was a NASA mission last year. I was just made aware of it. And what I learnt has changed everything. Everything I know to be true about the laws of physics. I was only made privy to a *fraction* of the data from the initial report, but it was enough to convince me. God isn’t real.”

“Well, you’re only giving *me* a fraction of a fraction of the story,” I pointed out, a tad facetiously. “Come on, Jack. Spit out whatever you’re trying to say.”

“There’s an edge to our universe,” my brother finally choked. “And beyond that edge, there’s… nothing. They found nothing. That’s what the official document says. They found a white abyss, like space inverted. And that’s… it. The end of all ends.”

We both sat in silence for a moment. A multitude of moments. After three decades of life, I know the difference between Jack’s truths and lies—his sincerity and his humour. This was the former, not the latter.

“Are you sure you didn’t misinterpret whatever you read?” I asked.

“I’m sure,” he quickly replied.

I nodded. “Well, you’ve mentioned before that you typically don’t have the clearance to access full NASA documents. Important information will have been redacted. Information that might provide a clearer picture, perhaps?”

“It doesn’t matter,” he said. “It doesn’t matter how much of it was redacted. I read enough to learn that there’s nothing beyond our reality. No pearly gates. No Creator watching us from above, below, or to the sides. This is an island floating in a white abyss. That’s the universe. Not an infinite plane, not a doughnut-shaped spiral, and not a large, planet-like sphere. It has boundaries. If you travel in any given direction fast enough, and far enough, you’ll reach the end. You’ll pass the end and enter that… other place. A place that is nowhere and nothing.”

I shivered as the room started to blacken further. The table lamp’s light wrestled failingly against the lounge’s strengthening gloom. Again, with my logical brain at the wheel, I dismissed this. It was my stomach, actually, that sensed something was wrong—that started to gurgle. Its contents were whisked like a thick pool of batter; my body knew that something was wrong, but my mind denied it.

Perhaps I’ve always been more like Jack than I wanted to believe. We both did our damnedest to believe in anything but God—any kind of higher power.

Last night, however, I considered just the opposite.

For the first time in my life, I was agnostic.

“What do you think?” my brother eventually asked.

I frowned. “That you just divulged highly confidential information.”

“Michael…” he groaned.

“I don’t know!” I cried. “I suppose I think that the idea of a finite universe with an edge—a bloody *edge*—is absolutely insane. And maybe NASA will eventually publish their research, confirming the evidence in the report. That would be a wondrous thing, but it still wouldn’t prove that God isn’t real, Jack.”

“Nowhere in any religious text does it describe what those astronauts saw,” said my brother, then he reached into his briefcase and produced a hefty wad of documents. “I’m going to post this entire thing online. Maybe somebody out there will be able to fill in the gaps—tell us about the redacted information I haven’t been permitted to access.”

“There’s a word for that, Mr Snowden,” I warned, raising a hand to signify that he should slow his roll. “Just calm down. If you leak classified information, you’ll face a whole heap of trouble.”

“I don’t work for the American government,” Jack retorted, rising to his feet with the papers tightly held in his hands. “The world needs to know. You’re right, okay? Something important has been left out, and somebody out there will know *what*. And then we can all finally accept the truth. That humanity is alone. That there’s no big, scary God watching over us. That we—”

With a shattering sound, the table light’s bulb burst, spitting shards of glass against both the inside of the lampshade and the coffee table beneath.

I clutched my pounding chest, trying to smile at the sudden startling moment, but I was focusing too heavily on the room’s heavy darkness. Each thump of my heart was more urgent than the last. My body was screaming at me to pay attention—to do something. And the final part of my body to join my other fear-ridden organs was my brain.

Something was happening.

Something we couldn’t explain with known science.

*It was only a blown bulb*, any other rational person would say.

But you weren’t in that room. I knew it was an omen.

“Jack?” I whispered, eyeing his silhouette poking above the headrest of the armchair.

And then that shadow plummeted downwards—folded into itself, like loose clothing, and disappeared into the black outline of the chair.

I screamed, leapt to my feet, and slipped my phone out of my pocket. When I illuminated the chair, however, I found it empty.

My brother was gone.

He had, impossibly, vanished into thin air within the space of a half-second.

Quivering, I cast my phone’s torch beam around the unlit room, and then I illuminated something odd—beyond the lounge’s doorway, in the lobby, there swung an open door which led into the cupboard beneath the stairs. Much like Jack’s vanishing act, the door-opening had happened of its own accord.

I exited the living room, and my eyes twitched disbelievingly as I neared the tiny door.

Inside what should have been a cupboard no more than one foot in breadth and depth, was a long hallway with mahogany walls.

This impossible corridor had appeared beneath my brother’s staircase, stretching far beyond the outer bounds of his house. Those wood-planked walls were plastered with sheets of paper, scribbled with writing that hurt my eyes to read. And leading along the tiled floor towards the door at the other end of the hallway was a trail of blood-and-flesh-covered bones.

That induced a round of horrified vomiting.

And when I lifted my teary eyes again, the room beneath the stairs had changed a second time.

It had become a white abyss with a wooden desk in its centre—the only furnishing in that nothingness. Atop that desk, rolling unsupported, was a small glass sphere—a crystal ball of sorts. Within the sphere was blackness painted with specks of burning colour. Yellows and greens and blues. The world within the ball looked almost, to me, like the universe itself. A reality globe.

“Jack?” I foolishly bellowed into the void.

In response, the crystal ball began to roll.

And when the globe toppled off the edge of the desk, the white room turned black—as if it had flicked a light switch off. One last time, I opened my mouth to call for Jack.

But then came footsteps.

Booming footsteps, reverberating off the walls of that infinite void—I was certain the place had no walls. Was certain that it had neither a floor nor a ceiling, and that the desk had simply been an illusion, like everything else in that place.

The footsteps neared. The sounds of feet broad and imbued with divine rage. I knew it was no man, I knew it was angry, and I knew it was coming for me.

Terrified, I slammed the cupboard door shut and tripped clumsily backwards. I slid against the wall to a sitting position on the lobby floor, then I wailed in terror as the steps beyond the door continued to louden, and I closed my eyes.

I prayed. To what? I don’t know. Any and every deity that has ever existed.

Then I heard the door fling open, and I squeezed my eyes more tightly together.

But nothing came.

And ten or twenty minutes later, I opened my eyes.

My brother’s house was still black, so I lifted my phone and lit the open doorway beneath the stairs.

The room had become a storage cupboard again.

And Jack was nowhere to be seen.

I have spent the last twenty-four hours hunting for him, but I know he disappeared in that hallway of blood and bones. I pray they weren’t his.

He left only the NASA report behind. Documents still lying on his living room carpet. Every time I look at them, my eyes hurt—glassy spheres that swim ferociously against the void of my sockets.

It’s a warning. We’ve taken the forbidden fruit, and my only hope is to not learn any more than I already know. If I read that full report and reveal it to the world, I will face the same fate as my brother—whatever fate that may have been. The same fate, I assume, that must have befallen those NASA researchers.

Unless my brother’s mistake was simply to threaten to share his knowledge with the world. Knowledge of a God—or a thing—that we are not supposed to see.

In any case, I must accept that Jack isn’t coming back. He met his end. An end worse than death, inflicted by something that may not have even been God.

Not any God we know.

Out of the corner of my eyes, I keep seeing shapes slinking out of view. Sometimes, it’s a man. Tall—impossibly so. His limbs stretch out towards my frightened form. Other times, it is a flicker of festering light. Living light. It moves in an erratic way.

It doesn’t matter which shape presents itself because they’re all illusions—physical manifestations designed purely to make sense to human eyes.

1iy8was,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1iy8was/i_feel_conflicted_about_my_girlfriends_boundaries/,I feel conflicted about my girlfriends boundaries (M20 F21). How do I set a middle ground?,"My girlfriend mentions that she is usually cold and distant when it comes to interacting with boys which majority is during her classes at university. However, she has an exception for a childhood friend (M20) because they have been growing up as neighbors up till now.

From my own perspective, she's been okay one time with taking a walk together with him around the neighborhood because his mom  encouraged her to. She's okay with ""gifting"" him snacks or sweets that she cant finish or even like. She once put up a greetings sign on her window wondering if he would see it. When she went to a comic-con with her friends, she planned to meet him there too. She's okay with going to University together with him on the days their class schedules align, sometimes meeting up at campus as well. She's also asked him to accompany her to campus for a group meeting next week.

I asked why that friend is an exception and she basically explains how she pities him because of his shyness and lack of social skills which leads to him having no friends. She has seen what its like for another one of her friend (F20) go through a similar situation and doesnt want her childhood friend to go through the same. As you can see, my girlfriend cares of him which is nice of her and I find understandable.

My problem lies where my girlfriend stated that she finds it uncomfortable if I ever went anywhere outside with any girl. Her reasons aernt known but its clear that she has a boundary for that, most likely due to her being a person that gets jealous easily. 

As we both discuss, I questioned the irony being played here to seek reasons why she thought its normal for her to hang out with him but not okay for me to hangout with any girl, which she then justifies it with various factors such as them both studying at the same campus means its normal to walk there and meet together or that if she isnt going out her way to change plans just so they can meet, its alright for her.

I havent mentioned these points till now because I found it weird but worth pointing out:

1. Her mentioning about being cold towards boys is hard for me to imagine because Ive never seen her act cold toward a boy other than being her kind, considerate and extroverted self. She's told me instances before where she would exchange comics with another classmate and would often make jokes. She once got asked to get coffee together by another classmate but she had classes which she told me how she felt guilty for not being able to go get coffee with him. She's asked a former-classmate which class he would be taking next semester so she could join him to not be alone. (All these are boys)

2. Her reasoning to go to Uni with her childhood friend is because she feels alone. She does have several girl friends but none of them are available to meet or she isnt bothered to ask her other friends for their schedule.

Its hard for me to understand how its not okay to hangout and catch up with, lets say, a female childhood friend but my girlfriend think its okay to ask and accept invitations to hangout with her male friend that she feels bad for.",1,1740525306.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

I got my first data analyst job in December for a small insurance adjusting company of about 4 other people and was laid off Friday due to completing all the work they had available for me. For this current resume, I left out all other work experience because it was unrelated and a little sporadic for a while. Not sure if it would help to list my bosses on my resume as references -they agreed to be references and I assume that might help soften the fact that I was only there for two months.

Anyway, I can't provide any numbers on the effect of my work since I was there so briefly, otherwise I would. Also I cut out the header of the resume before uploading it here rather than censor it or change the my contact info, so don't mind that.

I'm also plus-sized (US size 16-18 currently) and bigger clothes and bodies just take up more space, so that's an additional challenge. It ranged from ~20F-40F in temperature over the 4 days I was in NYC. 

This is more of a 1.5 bag, since I had a backpack and a carry-on spinner. Without further ado; my packing list:

Foundation:

* 1x Smartwool Merino undershirt (fuschia)
* 2x 32 Degrees insulating leggings (black)
* 1x Cotton leggings (black/white plaid) (these went under the 32 Degrees leggings because I have sensory issues and do not like the feeling of most synthetic fabrics against my skin).

* 1x REI Merino Socks (gold)

* 3x Bras (1x Navy, 2x White)

Bottoms:

* 1x Jeans (Old Navy OG Loose, gray, button fly)

Tops/Dresses:

* 2x cotton t-shirt
* 1x Old Navy cotton button-up shirt dress (black)

Outerwear:

* Fleece-lined Hoodie (no idea where it came from or what brand it is, but my mom got it at Kohl's on a sale and it's burgundy and pretty warm).

--------------------------------------------------------------

**Items Breakdown:**

**What I Regret Bringing:**

Jeans. These are at the top of the regrets list. I get bloated when I travel and these just did not work for me because of that. I've owned them for a while and worn them in my daily life just fine, but they're not good for travel and they took up a lot of space in the luggage. I'm just going to buy another pair of the Powersoft Cargo Joggers. Having so many pockets available is great, but they are sweat wicking (not warm) and layering leggings underneath didn't help nearly enough.

Cotton Leggings. They were great at first, but I had to wash them and they took like 1.5 days to dry whereas the 32 Degrees leggings and the Powersoft joggers were bone dry the next morning. I basically only got to wear them once because I couldn't wear them the next day since they weren't dry and just sort of had to deal with my sensory issues from the 32-Degrees leggings, which wasn't ideal. I'm on the hunt for some quick drying insulated leggings that I can tolerate for my future winter travels.

Tumbler and Instant Coffee. I wanted to save money on purchasing coffee, but this didn't work on my last trip or this one and I'm giving up on it. In the past, I've been able to find hot water without issues so I could just make coffee/tea myself, but hotels are all switching to these terrible dinky little coffee pots that barely heat water and only have like a 6oz capacity. The one in my hotel room didn't get the water hot enough to do anything with it. My backup plan was just to go to a store and buy a thing of cold brew coffee and some creamer, but I guess that's not a thing in NYC or there's some kind of shortage of it (???) because I could not find it anywhere. Long story short, I just bought Starbucks every morning. Win some, lose some. I think I'll just suck it up and buy coffee on shorter trips like this in the future. My next 2 trips are a 3-week research trip to New Mexico where I can just bring a camping kettle and a pourover cup and a 10-day trip to Germany where I'll also bring my pourover cup since they have electric kettles in most hotels in Europe, so I should be fine.

Huamulan Sherpa Hat. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a hat when it's hardly ever ""warm hat weather"" where I live. You get what you pay for. It was $9 and it was hanging on by a literal thread by the end of the weekend. I will be buying another better winter hat or making one.

Converse All Weather: Not necessarily a regret. I brought them in case it snowed or iced over and it didn't for the time I was there, so I just didn't need them.

Gloves. They were way too bulky and took up too much space. I'll buy some more expensive thinner insulated gloves for future winter trips.

Smartwool Merino Undershirt: It was scratchy and really set off my sensory issues. It was fairly warm and I layered it under a t-shirt and my fleece sweater for one day, but the constant scratchiness just bothered me. The cuffs also got very stretched out very quickly from pushing them up to my elbows indoors, which annoyed me. I will be looking elsewhere for insulating undershirts.

**What I Wish I Brought:**

Another dress!

I either needed a thin cardigan to go over my dress or a slip with long sleeves to go underneath it. Or maybe a slightly thicker dress with long sleeves? Still workshopping this one. All I know is that I was slightly cold when I took my coat off indoors.

A packable clothesline. There wasn't anywhere to hang anything so I ended up using some of the hangers in the hotel closet hung over the TV, which meant I couldn't use the TV for that night. I couldn't hang them in the hotel closet because it had an annoying light that was always on if the closet door was open and they wouldn't have dried in a closed closet.

Some kind of intensive moisturizer because NYC air is dry as hell in winter. I'm from the mecca of humidity, so I didn't realize it would be this bad up north.

**What I'm Glad I Brought:**

Bagsmart Medium Crossbody Quilted Puffer Bag. This thing was awesome as a day bag. It packs down pretty flat, but the quilting gives it enough structure to hold up well as a bag. It's a messenger-style with a flap, but also has a zippered main compartment to add pickpocket protection or just stop things from falling out. It's also got a slightly elastic deep pocket on the front that was perfect for stashing my hat or a water bottle since it expanded to fit whatever I needed to put in it and the flap secured everything in the pocket nicely. I had enough room for a big bottle of water, my wallet, my medication pouch, my hat and gloves when I wasn't wearing them, and even some small souvenirs. Excellent bag, very affordable and, imo, semi-stylish. My only gripe is that the strap is a tad too flimsy for my tastes and I'll be replacing it with a more substantial one later. My previous day bag was a Land's End small quilted crossbody (discontinued), but I found it just a tad too small for practical vacation use even if I do like it for daily use when I'm not on vacation.

Dress! I debated even bringing it because I was only going to wear it to one event where I wanted to look at least semi-nice. I ended up wearing it with leggings for 2 whole days because of how comfy it was. My parka was mid-thigh length and my layered leggings were plenty warm enough, especially since the longest I spent outside at any one time was 20-30 minutes and I was always walking and generating heat that way. I also have naturally insulated thighs (thick thighs ftw!) and perhaps I need less protection from the elements than some others might.

North Face Snow Down Parka. I almost didn't bring it because of how much space I knew it was going to take up a lot of space, but I'm so glad I did. It's not exactly a packable coat, but I was able to squish it into my suitcase by lying on top of the suitcase as I zipped it closed. Easily 1/3 of my suitcase space was taken up by this coat. You might notice that this is the only high-end piece of gear I own and it's been well-worth the monetary investment. I bought it for about $240 on sale for a trip to Switzerland in winter and it was just as pratical and excellent for walking around NYC where that freezing wind coming through the buildings was sharp as a knife. They're also one of the few brands that make proper outdoor gear in plus sizes.

Hey Dudes. The Karina Crochet in black is probably one of my favorite pairs of shoes of all time. They're flexible, versatile, comfy, and look put-together with pretty much any outfit. I wore these on the plane, skirting puddles of I-don't-want-to-know on the subway, trudging through Central Park mud, a Broadway show and a comedy club, through 2 museums, and back on the plane again. I clocked 17 total miles in these bad boys over 3 days of walking and I regret nothing. The Merino socks made them warm enough that my feet didn't feel cold and I was probably moving my feet enough to generate enough frictional heat that it didn't matter anyway.

Merino Socks! I was testing different sock brands this trip. The REI merino socks got stinky too quickly for my tastes, but were the comfiest option and provided more warmth. The Darn Tough were a little too thin and not as comfy or warm, but could be worn a few times before getting too stinky and needing to be washed. I'll probably buy another pair of the REI Merinos for a future trip and just plan to wash them.

Bino Laundry Detergent Sheets. I've used them in a proper washer and they also worked perfectly for sink washing my leggings. Very light fragrance, they dissolve quickly even in cold water, the sheets are very packable, and the detergent left the clothes perfectly clean. $10 for 100 sheets.

Lovevook Backpack. This continues to be my favorite backpack. I bought it about a year and a half ago and it's still going strong. It's got a laptop compartment so I can section off my electronics and I can use it by myself for a true one-bag with a packing cube and a toiletry bag in the main compartment or in conjunction with my spinner suitcase since it's got a strap to secure it to a suitcase handle. I'm a grad student and I take it to classes with me 4 days a week, as well. I have a hiking pack and a military surplus backpack that I use for backpacking trips and hiking/camping trips, but I like this one for ""civilized"" trips because it just looks polished and nicer than a hiking pack or a raggedy surplus pack while also being versatile and comfy.

London Fog Suitcase: Got it 11 years ago and it's been on 20+ trips. Unfortunately, I think it's been long-since discontinued, but it still works perfectly for my needs. 

Kindle: Continues to be the GOAT when it comes to travel entertainment for me. Every trip, I just budget $15-$20 for books and buy 3-5 so I can have options. I've tried KU, but it doesn't work with my reading style.

Random Kohl's hoodie my mom bought me on sale. Seriously, this thing was unexpectedly awesome. Comfy and fleece-lined and warm. It went on the plane there and back and all around the city with me.

Masks! So many people were just full on coughing their lungs up in the airport, on the metro, at restaurants, etc. I would have thought more people would wear masks in a liberal city like NYC, but almost nobody did and I got a lot of weird looks for doing so. I get sick super easily and have asthma which makes getting even minor respiratory infections deadly, so masks are just a must for me anymore when I travel.

______________________

**Conclusion/TL;DR:**

I think I was really successful on this trip! I was mostly comfy and insulated from the elements while still retaining what I felt was a semi-fashionable look. The standout stars were the Hey Dude shoes, the Bagsmart bag, the North Face parka, and the random sale hoodie my mom bought me. The standout disappointments were the jeans, the hat, and the stuff I brought in the attempt to make my own coffee. The things I'd look into getting for future winter travels are; a warm packable winter hat, thin insulated winter gloves, thicker insulated base layers, and more merino wool socks. I did a lot in New York and I felt well-supported by my gear for most of that time.

-------


**Travel Destination Discussion:**

Would I recommend NYC in February? Yes! Tourist destinations were less crowded, the food was great almost everywhere we went, and the weather was perfectly manageable with the proper gear. I will say that I live in a lower COL area and NYC is an ultra HCOL, so everything was expensive as fuck. I was traveling with my sister, so we could share hotel and rideshare costs and also share food at restaurants and that helped a lot. Most restaurants had something that was decently priced and share-sized. Food Recs: Get the banana pudding at Magnolia Bakery and try the waffle fries at Emmy Squared.

As far as entertainment goes, I found the Met incredibly underwhelming and overcrowded and the American Museum of Natural History to be purely fine. I'd target live entertainment and unique shops and restaurants on future visits. Six on Broadway was the best show I've seen in my fucking life. 10/10. We got orchestra-level tickets for $45 a person by buying them same-day at the box office onsite. Drunk Shakespeare at the Ruby Theatre was an unexpected delight and also cost $38/person through TodayTix, a website that specializes in sameday discounted tickets to shows. It's a very intimate venue and more of a raunchy booze-fueled improv comedy show than it is any actual attempt at a coherent rendition of MacBeth. The Shakespeare, at best, is just a pretense for the actors to dress up in dollar-store costumes and do funny voices to pad out their improv bits. I found it hilarious, but I can easily see how someone would not get it and would not like it.

Public transportation in NYC was good and bad in different areas. I still ended up walking ~7 miles a day, but it's a somewhat convenient way to get around. While it is totally possible to take the metro to and from either airport (LGA > JFK, fight me) with luggage, I was told to just use Uber/Lyft by a friend who used to live in NYC and I'm glad I listened. The trains were often 15+ minutes behind schedule and there were several major delays, one of which put an entire line out of commission. From the airport, sure. To the airport? Too risky to trust public transport and too many stairs if you have a suitcase. It was also just absolutely filthy. Everything had a thick layer of grime on it and there were puddles of urine everywhere. I have used public transport in probably a dozen cities all over the world and I'm confident in saying NYC's metro is the filthiest and the least reliable I've ever used. (Zurich is #1, if anyone was wondering.) 

We stayed in Manhattan near Hudson Yards and I'd recommend the area. Safe at night, plenty of shops and restaurants, and it was near Penn Station which meant we could get anywhere in Manhattan without much hassle... but, you know, budget in like 15-20 minutes for late trains if you've got to be somewhere on time.

Well, that's all, folks! I hope someone will enjoy this novella and learn from my mistakes and my triumphs.",13,1740525042.0,HerOneBag,2,0.93,False

I had no contact with her until now. And to end it she also says ""What is it with you getting stuff for free not fair??

The only issue? My friend used to work there and was fired about a year a go. She told me not to take the job, saying it would ""destroy my mental health"" and that I would ""definitely get fired too.""

Here’s the thing: I used to work with this friend at another store (where we met), and she was an **awful** employee. Bad attitude, rude to staff, thought she was better than everyone, and lacked basic skills. This is also the third job she’s been fired from.

Our friendship is honestly really toxic. I’ve tried to distance myself multiple times, but she love-bombs me, and I’m an autistic people-pleaser, so somehow, I’m now the maid of honor at her upcoming wedding (but that’s another thread).

I’ve been at this job for a week now, and I love it. The team is great, super supportive, and the location is ridiculously convenient. I’m someone who gets along with people and does my job efficiently, so I don’t usually have work conflicts, unlike my friend.

Now she’s mad at me for taking the job and keeps saying I made a mistake.

Seventeen dollars. A bottle of seventy melatonin gummies costs seventeen dollars at Target. When I read the sign I thought it said ten, but no, it’s seventeen dollars. At least I know I will get my money’s worth; I doubt I will use the melatonin often. This will probably be the only time I buy it.  
  
Target did not have the caffeinated chocolate I wanted, so instead I bought pills of pure caffeine. One pill is as potent as two cups of coffee, so I need to make sure I ingest them responsibly. Only one pill when I feel it is absolutely necessary. I don’t want to take too much caffeine. Heart problems, anxiety, and unpleasant hallucinations are not what I am looking for. I just want some focus. I don’t even need to feel awake, just focused. I don’t really care if it is potentially damaging. Whatever will help me to actually write will be good in the long run, despite any adverse effects. Still, I will only take what I need in a responsible manner. If I am going to write, I would want to write for as long as I possibly can.

I’ve only worked at JoAnn for two years now. My anniversary date is actually this week. I came in as an ASM having virtually no experience with crafting. I worked in children’s theatre until the pandemic started and then found myself slinging coffee for The Siren ™️ to make ends meet after live theatre became impossible for a while. 

My partner and I moved out of my home state and I found myself unemployed for about 3 months. It was extremely exhausting on my mental health to feel so unproductive and I found it difficult to find any work that spoke to me in a creative way. Then I found my local JoAnn Fabrics. Approximately 7 minutes from our apartment and in need of some middle management help. It didn’t take long at all to become instantly hooked with the world of crafting. 

Thanks to this job and the wonderful team I have come to know and love, I consider myself a quilter, a gardener, and a crocheter. I’ve opened my own small business making toys for friends and acquaintances. I’ve made blankets for my family, name placards for my team, and countless stuffies for myself, my partner, and those around me. I find myself eagerly awaiting when the JoAnn spring collection would drop so i could find new pots for my plants, or cute decor for my garden. In a time where I was feeling extremely uncreative, this job helped me find that spark again.

My team is among the best I could have ever asked for. They were already a very tightknit group before I came onboard, and I was worried about coming in at the ASM level with no prior crafting or even really retail experience. I’m so blessed that they not only accepted me into their family, but gave me confidence in my leadership abilities that I simply did not have before them. We were not one of the original 500 to close, and while i knew that our store closing was an inevitably, I still am filled with an immeasurable sadness for this absolutely stellar group. I wish that I could take this staff with me to every job in my future. 

These next few days, weeks, and months will be very painful. But I will try and make them ask positive for myself and my team as possible. I can only encourage that all my fellow team members do the same.

Whether you’re in my store or not, know my heart goes out to you all. Thank you for being there when I thought no one else would be. I love you all. May whatever chapter comes next be a good one for us all and may you all find handmade happiness wherever you go. 💕",8,1740524739.0,joannfabrics,0,0.91,False

I drink rarely, I’m relatively active (walking & yoga). I take Wellbutrin and Prozac both related to depression/anxiety. Currently no medical diagnoses

Going for a biopsy on lymph nodes. 

Last February I started to get really weird sharp pains in my head. One night I woke up with two small lumps at the base of my skull behind my neck. Otherwise I would get weird heat rashes and itchiness when getting out of the shower or wearing tighter clothing which turned into little red blood dots but not really much bruising. Other stuff like dizziness, ringing in my ears, complete deafness for a split second, nystagmus, literally a laundry list of different things but I never really pieced these symptoms together as possibly being intertwined. 

Over the last year, I’ve sought out medical help multiple times to be given blood test after blood test, “everything is normal”. I have had 2 ultrasounds on my neck and my groin, and my neck has multiple swollen lymph nodes, groin has 2. The results all interpret different findings for each ultrasound. One says they are reactive and should resolve (I’ve had them for over 2 years ish but the two skull ones are newer). One result said I had a swollen node at 20mm, and “lost it echogenic hilim” whatever that means. The doctor for that ultrasound wrote that all my lymph nodes that were evaluated had lost the hilim. He stated they were presumably reactive and “should resolve”. Well they haven’t. And things have got worse. I don’t want to write out the entire last year because it would be like 20 paragraphs long, but essentially it got to the point where a resident doctor literally said to me I was delusional and in psychosis and to not come back for pain in your head and neck/trouble swallowing cause there isn’t anything wrong, and there are people who need actual help (heart attack, etc). (Canada healthcare 😒😒😒) I was floored by that. Yes I am an anxious person but I know my body and know there is something going on physically. 

Anyway, nothing ever was followed up with these ultrasounds or anything. I this last month after a while of giving up decided to book an appt with rocket doctor, told him everything I’m experiencing and he first started out with blood work and ANOTHER ultrasound. Ultrasound was same “presumable reactive will go down” they haven’t tho. And more have shown up over the last year. Bloodwork wise -my iron was low and thyroid level low but within normal limits I guess. A few days later I broke out in this horrible itch all over my body, like I wanted to scrape off my skin. But mainly it’s my legs, sometimes arms and then my feet. My body is bruising so severely and I’m getting petechiae from the scratching as well. After seeing the rocket doctor for the petechiae and itch literally a few hours later I had to go to emergency room because it kept getting worse and the doctor didn’t know what it was. He said steroid cream won’t help as it’s under my skin. Suspected autoimmune and prescribed me some allergy pills but they do nothing. 


 The doctor from rocket doctor (thank god for him) was concerned regarding the petechiae and lymph nodes and has decided to order a biopsy. I’ve been referred to an internal medicine doctor. Im so happy about this, but also frustrated and nervous that I have to wait until MAY for the biopsy. I’m going to be overthinking for the next 3 months. I’m just really confused because my blood has been normal for the most part, the ultrasound results aren’t overly concerning, but i have all these symptoms so I don’t understand how even though there is clearly something going on, wouldn’t it show on my blood??? 

Current symptoms:
- extreme itch - nothing there to itch just itchy skin like under the surface almost, petechiae is severe from even the lightest itch. There is nothing rash wise on my skin. It feels itchy deep down and I keep scratching. 
- random bruising (severe, I can’t post pics here but it’s like my whole leg, back of leg, arms etc)
-exhausted after sleeping 8-9 hours 
- no appetite
- swollen nodes but not visible to the eye 
- hair loss (hair thinned a lot over the last year)
-dizziness, becoming physically exhausted from getting up from bed to get a coffee
-itchy eyes/feels like there’s a grain or something in them sometimes 
- sometimes I get like a red dotted rash that isn’t petechiae. 
- weird little sores in mouth that come and go in same spot 
- freezing hands and feet (like they are never warm, mostly my feet)
- sore leg mainly my right, achey/crampy feeling. Idk it just feels like growing cramps when you were a kid 
- pain in right side of neck and ear, especially when I swallow. 
- ear ache/sudden deafness for like a split second

Honestly, I just wanted to write this out for the sake of not feeling alone. I’m aware it’s impossible to diagnose me and in fact not possible to diagnose what we think it is until I get a biopsy. It’s not til May 13, and internal medicine consult scheduled for March. My doctor and I spoke a bit about the possibility of it being lymphoma, leukemia (but wouldn’t that show up in blood?) or autoimmune and I’m panicking and don’t want to feel so alone. All my blood is normal but I have all these things going on and I feel like I’m going crazy and the doctors (except for most recent) keep chalking it up to anxiety 😟. I guess what I’m getting at is does anyone have experience with this? Similar story? Positive story? Just something because right now I’m just left again wondering for 3 months what it could be. And if it’s biopsied and it isn’t anything malignant, then what the heck is it😭😭😭

Any help/advice/reassurance will be super appreciated.

**The Keeper**

The nigh day-long bicycle ride through the fir-laden backcountry to my uncle-in-law’s reclusive seaside cabin was a pleasant one, though its conclusion wasn’t lost on me. The gales that July day were the kind to stab straight through you, leaving you a bag of brittle bones in their wake. Even cocooned in a hardy layer of wool garments, the frigid Pacific cold front couldn’t be kept at bay. By the time I reached the door my hands had long since gone white, and drowsiness beckoned warmly.

I lingered outside on the porch for a while nonetheless, so that I might take in the lighthouse by the water in all its splendour, and bask in rays of sunshine now ephemeral, the dissipation of their delicate heat into my skin no doubt soon to be thwarted by the incoming evening storm creeping over the horizon.

Finding the moment just, I decided to give my uncle a call, if only to thank him for lending me the property for my weekend getaway and notify him of my arrival.

“Fret not!” he reassured me in his customary hearty tone. “Well, good. *Good*… What simply wondrous news. How was the trip over?”

I laughed and spoke to him of the things I’d seen on the way, recounting rolling flowery fields and cotton candy-looking clouds that floated idly by. It was when I made mention of the lighthouse, and how beautiful it was, perched there on the end of the bay, that he went eerily silent.

“R-really?” he finally sputtered.

“What: *really?*” I asked light-heartedly.

There followed a lengthy pause. My uncle’s voice was monotone when he answered.

“Are you outside, watching it as we speak?”

“Why, yes,” I replied. “The view truly is something, is it not?”

“Describe it to me.”

“Describe wh-”

“The lighthouse. Describe it.”

I opted to disregard his sudden peculiar state and play along. I took a gander at the lighthouse, nestled between a crag and the sweeping sandy beach.

“It’s a quaint little thing, an unassuming one at that. Light yellow with a tiny window in the midd-”

“With a red cupola and gallery atop the tower?”

“Um, yeah?”

“You see it too?”

“Of course I see it,” I said, uncertain whether my amusement ought to be concern. “It’s *there*.”

Another pause, longer.

“Alice... *Normal* people don’t see it.”

“You mean, they don’t *notice* it in all likelihood? It isn’t exactly in-your-face. Nor does it stick out like a sore thumb.”

“No,” he sighed deeply. “I mean they *can’t* see it. It doesn’t *exist*. I mean it *does*, just not to *them*.” When he felt my confusion, he added: “I know this is your first time visiting my cabin, but I can assure you there isn’t supposed to be any lighthouse there. There never was for me until very recently.”

I chuckled to myself.

“Perhaps they built it over the winter,” I offered. “After all, you only just opened up the shack for summer last week. You’ve been away in the city the remainder of the year.”

“No no. Nobody ever built it. It doesn’t *really* exist!”

“I’m *not normal* then, am I not? Seeing as I’m seeing it...”

“Well, you’re the only other person I know who has. You and I were *chosen*.”

“Chosen? Whatever for?... Uncle Barry, is everything okay? You’re scaring me.”

Was this some attempt at a ruse? I’d never known my uncle as being much of a trickster.

“Further, the family came along with me last week,” he persisted as though I hadn’t spoken.

“Pardon?”

“The lighthouse, it isn’t new, in fact it’s surprisingly old. My family, they were with me.”

I shook my head.

“And what did they have to say about this?” I queried sternly.

“Oh, God forbid they ever find out about the lighthouse!”

“So you’ve not talked to them about it at all?” I exclaimed.

“Most certainly not. I was... *prepared*. Quite serendipitously so too.”

“Prithee, tell me why not,” I responded sarcastically, frustrated by his seemingly purposeful lack of clarity.

“It’s best they not find out about it, lest the lighthouse reveals itself to them as well. We were all present, yet the lighthouse only became visible to me, the sole individual who knew about it beforehand.”

Waves crashed and washed away rhythmically off in the distance, severing my uncle’s words and rendering them more incoherent than they already were.

“How can one have knowledge pertaining to something no one has seen?”

“As I said, I was somewhat prepared, hence my not telling them about it.”

“I don’t imagine seeing a lighthouse is the most special of events, and could see seeing one not cropping up in conversation. How are you to know your family didn’t see it?”

“They didn’t.”

I felt exasperated, the migraine that had pestered me since dawn now exacerbated by a discussion resembling more a merry-go-round than it did an actual discussion.

“You fear telling your family, yet here I stand, beholding a lighthouse I knew nothing of. How can your theory thus possibly hold?”

“Listen, I get that you’re ups-”

“And whatever would you be trying to achieve in the first place, sparing their eyes from something as innocuous as a lighthouse?”

“I really can’t explain...”

“Then *try*.”

It felt to me he was beating around the bush, stalling, like there was something more.

“I probably shouldn’t.”

“Fine,” I said. “I think it’s time I went to bed...”

My uncle sighed again, clearly ambivalent about something.

“Alice, you see, the hut’s been in the family for centuries. For generations it’s been the place where our ancestors spent their summers. And of them all only one ever wrote about a lighthouse in a dusty journal I happened upon in the attic. A lighthouse that appeared overnight, one that only he could perceive. He said everyone thought he’d gone mad.

“Naturally I didn’t believe a word of it either, but studied the entries regardless, and from those unknowingly gathered enough to be prepared for when I would eventually see it for myself, not that I expected I ever would.”

“I’m... I’m not sure I follow...” I began. Nonsensical and lacklustre though my uncle’s postulations were, there was a seriousness underlying them that simply couldn’t be ignored.

“That written account is precisely a hundred years old, but that’s not all. I found a discarded painting, caked in cobwebs, predating the journal by another hundred-odd years. It’s a depiction of a lighthouse. *The* lighthouse. It reoccurs periodically. So it appears.

“I need to know now, the door at its base, is it open? Is the entrance open?”

Asking why he took interest in something as mundane as a door was pointless. I didn’t much care. I simply peered at the lighthouse, at the doorway facing me.

“It is indeed, happy?” I said. Had it been open from the start? I’d been outside for so long I could no longer remember.

“Oh. I see.”

“What?” I pressed.

“Well.”

“Will you quit keeping things from me!” I snapped.

“The **Keeper**.”

“Huh??”

“The Keeper’s coming for you. Once the door is open, it means the Keeper’s seen you.”

“Who?”

“*The lighthouse keeper.*”

“Who’s that?”

“It’s what inhabits the lighthouse. An ancient curse that runs in our bloodline. Alice, I’m so terribly sorry, but there’s absolutely nothing you or I can do anymore. It was meant to be me, but I ran, managed to get away in time.

“I’d understood from reading the journal that the door isn’t always open. Once it is however, that’s really all she wrote. Our ancestor’s writings spanned over a handful of days, time during which he described the lighthouse and recurring unsettling visions he was having. In his final entry, he stated that something had changed: the door had mysteriously been opened.”

“What’s any of that got to do with me?” I blurted out after fruitless reflection, my words unable to help taking on a more morose character.

“Granted few and far between, it’s well known within the family that over the years there have been... acciden- *No*, fuck this, I can’t...” My uncle stopped, audibly overcome with emotion.

The sun suffocated in a thick veil of grey then, and the cold swooped down on me with great fervency.

“*Uncle Barry?*”

I waited anxiously, the questions swirling around in my head plenty.

This seemed real enough. The lighthouse was, wasn’t it? I mean, obviously it was real. After all, there it was, right? Right *there*. But was it *real* real, the type of real my uncle propounded it was? The type that wasn’t *really* real for most but for some was? Was that really what it was?

Was the Keeper *real* too? And what if the Keeper was?

I didn’t want to talk to any keeper. I didn’t want to be disturbed while on my solo break. I didn’t wa-

“I didn’t want it to be one of my children,” Uncle Barry continued grimly. “I knew it was merely a matter of time before it revealed itself to someone else, given that I would never return. So I sent you there under the pretence of spending a nice relaxing weekend. *Fuck.* I’m so- I- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fu- *What the hell have I done?*”

His breaths were heavy. Short. Almost mimicking the ocean’s to-and-fros.

A sniffle. Another sniffle. More sniffles.

Quiet. How I detested that. In it I tried drawing some semblance of sense from the mess my uncle had laid out before me, to no avail. None of it was true, I tried telling myself over and over.

“I hope you can find it in you to forgive me, for though this was a decision, it was no choice…” were his parting words, and swiftly he hung up, leaving me alone with the howling wind and its hardly comforting touch, on a beach with a lighthouse bearing some degree of existence.

I didn’t know just what to do then, and so, ensconced within the confines of the cabin—with the apprehension my uncle had imparted to me festering and indignation gnawing away at any thoughts outstanding—frantically in a makeshift journal of my own I wrote, before darkness swallowed the world and I was unable to see the lighthouse and its gaping door anymore.

&nbsp;

Rain battered the windows incessantly as night dragged inexorably on. The first traces of pale light eventually did start to bleed through a stagnant sea fog that clung to the world like a wet rag, staining everything a sickly sheen of silver. I ventured out onto the porch once more, a mug of scalding coffee in hand to counteract the nip in the air.

It had dawned on me just what a gullible idiot I was. A series of missed calls followed by a pitiful text from my uncle validated as much: *‘I regret what I said. Don’t leave the cabin! I’m on my way to make things right…’*

I overlooked the shore and wrote in my trusty guestbook to kill the time, ready to tear into him—provided he wasn’t taking the piss about coming here too.

**The Keeper’s Keep**

There was an inertness to Barry as engrossing as it was dismaying. One spreading to you like a sickness as you watched, *swallowing* you in its undeniable reality.
	
Barry’s expression had softened, from that of discomfort to something approximating (dare I say blasé?) disorientation, though placing it precisely wasn’t elementary without his eyes anymore. They were the first things to go.

Intently, I watched the earth beneath Barry change shades until none of him remained, after which what he’d gone into promptly watched me, those eyes affirming what I’d reluctantly come to expect: that room had been *kept* for me.

I’d have died for Barry to suffice, something which had in a certain respect proven to be true given the last of him hadn’t been wolfed down with quite the same vigour the rest had.

But it wasn’t. A dark *descent* of my own would come.

For this wasn’t a question of mere satiation.

While I hope one day we could get a print copy of the Cookbook, I know we can’t get it yet, as it’d be incomplete with the story still unfolding.  

In the meantime… 

What would be awesome is to get some sort of Dungeon World- Field Guide book.  A coffee table type book with information, descriptions and pictures of the various components and mechanics of the dungeon, along with descriptions of monsters, races, gods, various classes, weapons and spells that are known to exist.
Since it’s been established that many of the elements within this crawl are reoccurring from other seasons the existence of a book like a field guide could be the lore, written for a viewer or even for say an employee of the crawl- what they need to know working during a Dungeon World season.  And/or, it might even be sort of a text that exists for kids like Quasar’s niece, since they aren’t old enough to know all the crawl lore.

In many ways a field guide would be more practical to create than the Cookbook, as the Cookbook is supposed filled with many sad personalized stories and recipes that would need to be created still.

Many of the concepts are similar to existing D&D or VG descriptions with a DCC twist, which could help cobble it together.

Could make for a hell of a kickstarter…just saying.

3) school work, had to use my MacBook in the end, as my teacher said I couldn't use a ""switch"" to do my school work.. so I'm going to study for one hour in that subject to compensate on the deck!

8) Gayming!

Verizon, T-Mobile, ATT and Cox don’t have coverage there. Any recommendations?

Long story: 

I finally got a new job after being laid off for more than a year and as part of getting back on my feet I’m moving into a detached studio at an elderly family member’s property for a few months while I save up for a deposit for a place of my own. They are kinda anti- anything too modern, including having internet at home apparently, so the place definitely isn’t wired for anything beyond the bare basics. 

I definitely need internet but it’s beyond what you can really do at a coffee shop (which is what was suggested by said family member). I’ve looked into it and although I know there are several providers in the area that have 5G home internet they claim not to have coverage at that address (T-Mobile, Verizon) and I don’t want to go through the main house’s phone/cable setup as it might cause problems/disruptions to them. Any suggestions?

The main ones I was looking at were: HughesNet, viasat, and EarthLink. ",2,1740524115.0,HomeNetworking,2,1.0,False

Shes a very light drinker.  Never caused an issue til last night.  I've been thinking about this all day.

And also for context, we live in Mexico, where as everyone knows the water quality is less than ideal.  You cant use water out of the tap, for example; you gotta make ice from filtered water.

We're at a fiesta put on by her tío y tía,  its a great time.  I usually drink iced coffee, because while i like coffee, i love it cold.  I asked her for some ice, thinking shes gonna get it from the freezer (shes closest to the fridge).  My head is turned and im talking to other relatives.

So.  Shed been drinking a baileys with ice.  Without promping, she grabs an ice cube and plops it in my coffee to cool it off.  A few moments later, i take a sip and IMMEDIATELY can tell the flavor of the residual baileys. I say ""is this an ice cube from your cup? Why didnt you grab it from the freezer? Its a pull out freezer on the bottom, it literally wouldve taken 3 seconds...""

She exclaims ""oh come on, its a *tiny* bit of the cream on the ice cube...""  I immediately poured out the coffee, washed the cup and made a new one.  She didnt say anything else but the rest of the night was frosty.  On the drive home i brought up that being sober is my highest priority in life.  She said shes sorry but didn't think it would be an issue.  We sorta been cool to each other since waking up.

Am I overreacting? Its just a trust thing.  I know it was a miniscule amount of baileys on the ice cube but the fact that she did that has completely rubbed me the wrong way.  Its not like i asked her to walk across the street and get ice from the neighbors; it was literally next to her chair...

I dunno just feel weird about the whole thing.",3,1740524094.0,stopdrinking,9,0.66,False

We took in a 6 month old stray puppy last afternoon and have been taking care of him since then. He ate the dog food we got in the afternoon and again at night (after an hour long walk/play time outdoors) quite enthusiastically and has peed and pooped in a fairly normal way as far as I can tell. 

But this morning, after a 20-min walk, he didn’t pee or poop. He didn’t drink any water or eat after waking up. I took him out again in the afternoon for a walk, and he peed and pooped immediately after. But he’s still not eating anything, not even the treats he enjoyed last night. He drank some water only when I brought the bowl to his face a few times and once on his own. He’s been asleep on and off, doesn’t really move unless I get up from my desk to walk around to get coffee/water/food for myself. He was acting needy for belly rubs as usual when I got up but otherwise very quiet/idle. He sneezed a few times and has been yawning a lot. 

Is this normal for puppies?? Is he still adjusting or should we be concerned?? 

Edit: I may have overreacted lol, he’s eating on his own now just an hour or so after I made this post! Thanks again to those who commented",1,1740523885.0,DogAdvice,4,1.0,False
