1k4zepc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1k4zepc/the_cafe_sets_sail/,The Cafe Sets Sail,"Due to the success of my last post, [The Cat is Out of The Bag](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1jn5tq1/the_cat_is_out_of_the_bag/) , I thought I would write out another one for you wonderful people. It originates from a previous front desk in a hotel a few years past...

It wasn’t even 7 a.m. when my day kicked off.

I’d just pulled into work. The sun was shining, birds were chirping, and the usual morning smokers were already out on the patio, still in their robes. It felt like it was going to be a good day.

I clocked in and headed to the lobby, ready to start my shift. As I signed in, the ceiling , just across the lobby, right above our cafe, collapsed in a spectacular splash of water and soggy ceiling tile.

Jaw dropped, I fumbled for my phone and called the GM.

“You need to drive faster,” I said. “Like, *now*. We’ve got a situation.”

Just then, the barista walked through the lobby doors, no doubt hearing the splash. She took one look at the water-logged cafe, then turned her deadpan stare on me like *I* had unplugged her espresso machine mid-rush.

I gave her an overly enthusiastic smile. “Ahoy, matey! Mop the deck, we set sail at dawn!”

Without missing a beat, she saluted. “Aye aye, Captain,” oozing all sarcasm. Then headed off to the kitchen for a mop and wet floor cones. You gotta love the ones who don’t even need to be told, and act anyway.

I logged in, released the poor night agent, and grabbed my master key. He looked like he was barely clinging to sanity as he wished me good luck. On my way to the elevator, I tossed down a couple of towels and then mashed the Up button like it was the elevator to heaven and I’d sinned too much.

When I reached the second floor, I could already feel the squish of soaked carpet as I approached Room 205. The room directly above the cafe.

I knocked hard. “Front Desk! Front Desk! Open up, *now*!”

Silence.

No voices. No movement. No one answered. I unlocked the door.

The moment it cracked open, *whoosh!!!* Two inches of water burst out, flooding the hallway like a biblical reenactment. I jumped back and watched the wave roll past my shoes. Moses had the right idea.

Stepping into the room, I made my way to the bathroom. Both the tub and toilet were overflowing. I turned off the tub’s water, reached behind the toilet, and shut that off too.

I took a breath and began looking closer. The tub drain had been plugged, the overflow covered with a towel. The toilet had been stuffed with another towel, and the float in the tank had been popped off and left to bob aimlessly, letting the water run nonstop.

Just as I was taking it all in, the GM and our maintenance guy squished into the room behind me. I told them what I found, even though it was already apparent.

They thanked me for jumping in so quickly and sent me back down to the front desk. My shoes squished the whole way back.

By then, my fellow desk agent had arrived and was already helping with water control. I updated the two swashbucklers about what Room 205 looked like and warned them that our “new” water feature was only temporary. Cleanup was officially underway.

I got to work at the desk, sorting through the who’s-who of the morning’s madness and checking for any overnight notes while directing early birds to the cafe *a*round the corner.

The guy in 205? Checked in at 3am, checked out right before the ceiling collapsed. Barely thirty minutes between his exit and the flood. It wasn’t even 8 yet, and I'm already 5-years older.

The cafe, naturally, couldn’t open. Soggy ceiling tiles had buried the counters, the floor, the display case, and an entire rack of coffee mugs. But my new favorite person, our Salty-Seadog barista, managed to brew two fresh pots of coffee in the conference room and set them up with some bagels and fruit from the kitchen. No official breakfast, but she made it work. It seems The Crew knew what to do.

Most of the morning was spent soaking up the flood and relocating everyone within three rooms of the drama. Rooms were flipped, guests were greeted, and the chaos mostly stayed contained to one floor.The day flew by.

Damage-wise, only the baseboards, nightstands, and dresser took a hit. Particle board and water don’t mix, but the pergo floors look untouched. Thanks to our housekeeping legends, the hallway carpets were clean dry by the end of the day, and the room itself, was only out of service for a few days. Amen, for back-up furniture and big fans. The cafe was back the next morning, minus the ceiling.

And as for the guest?

He walked the plank, alright. DNR’d, blacklisted, and slapped with a bill hefty enough to make Davey Jones weep.

The tide rose, the cafe sank, and the crew still served coffee. That’s hospitality, mate.",1,1745302341.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,0,1.0,False

There's been an ancient conspiracy managing all of world history from the shadows, from Babylon to today."" ""So why is everything so messed up and chaotic?"" ""You'll notice I didn't say there's been a competent conspiracy managing all of world history from Babylon to today.""","“So. Now you know,” the woman said as she slid over a manila envelope marked ‘INDUCTION’ toward me. “There has been a conspiracy managing all of world history from the shadows. From Babylon…” She walked her fingers across the table toward her tea. “…all the way to today.”

I stared at the envelope. The sheer magnitude of the realization bore down on me, and I had too many questions all at once. The first to escape was a simple word: “How?”

“How?” she asked.

“How. How is everything so—“ I couldn’t find the words. Maybe it was the literal Illuminati sitting in front of me, but my mouth was dry.

“How is everything so… like this?” She waved her hand around, motioning to everything and nothing. 

“Yeah. I guess I—“ Was that a bad question? Now I needed to know. “None of it makes sense. Do I just not get it? Or…”

“Oh. Yeah, it wouldn’t make sense. Doesn’t make sense.”

“To a feeble mind like mine or something?”

“Oh no. In general.” She slid the dossier a little closer to me to insist I read it as she took a sip. I didn’t grab it quite yet. 

She sighed. “Look, sis. We have a whole global conspiracy, but here I am recruiting in a Second Cup. What does that say about us?”

“That Starbucks is counter to the world order?”

“No. You’re not thinking big enough.”

I took a second. “That every other coffee shop is—“

“What’s up with the coffee?”

“You brought it up first. Neither of us are even drinking coffee.” 

Her eyes darted from her tea to my shitty matcha. “The point isn’t coffee, but…“ She grabbed the envelope. “Shouldn’t there be more than this? I mean—it’s a global conspiracy and I’m handing you an envelope.” 

I stopped looking at her and her chunky glasses to stare at the envelope again. “I thought it was just low tech to avoid trackers.”

“We own the trackers. Who do you think made Gen-Z wanna know their friend’s location all the time?”

“I don’t.”

“So?”

“I’m Gen Z.”

“You’re like thirty. No way.”

“Twenty-eight. Born in ’97.”

She recoiled from the conversation like she’d just been told there was a global conspiracy. “Christ.”

I tapped the dossier to steer us back on track. “So what about this, then?” 

“Right. Couldn’t just stick that on an iPhone like normal people, could we? No. We handle this stuff like it’s the Cold War.”

“I figure there’s a good reason for that.”

The woman, who still hasn’t told me her name, leaned in close as a couple walked by. It looked like they were having a nice time on their date. I wished I was. 

“There’s no reason, sis. There’s no good reason for any of this.”

I leaned in to match. “Just for chaos then, or?”

“Occam’s razor.”

In the time it took me to remember what that meant, four Reddit comments would have corrected me. “It’s all incompetence.”

Her nodding started slow, but sped up as her frown grew. “Never been competent. Don’t think it ever will be.” 

What. What. WHAT?! “Pardon?”

“Well, we just haven’t been on top of things and—you know when you don’t get something done all week and suddenly it’s Sunday and you’ve gotta pack it all in?”

My mind twinged at her bringing up the laundry chair. “Yeah.”

“Well. The last couple thousand years have been the week. And we’re starting to get a little worried that it’s Sunday.”

“Why?”

She just stared.

“Fair enough.”

“So! We’re starting up recruitment again! Special. Just for people like you.”

“Like me?”

“Yes.”

“What’s the criteria?” I asked. I went to grab the dossier and she let go, allowing me to hold it but I didn’t open it yet.

She opened her mouth to continue the pace of our conversation, but then slowly closed it before clicking her tongue twice. 

“You don’t know?”

“The guy in IT told me to set up this meeting. The Algo said so.”

“TikTok?”

“Instagram reels.”

“That’s the worst one.” 

The woman just shrugged. 

“I’m not sure I wanna be part of this.”

She winced. “Sorry, now that you know, I’d have to kill you if you don’t come with.” Her being apologetic about it almost made it worse.

“How’s the pay?”

“Too low to justify selling out your morals, but high enough you’ll think about it.”

“Benefits?”

“Yes, but substandard coverage that’s annoying to deal with.”

“Time off?”

“Mostly when you’re ‘working’ but someone else isn’t on top of their shit so you’re just waiting for them to get back to you.”

“Sounds normal.”

“It isn’t.” 

That last response was a little too chipper. 

“Well. I’ll be shot otherwise, so—I’m in.”

“Great. Let me get you the antitoxin for the poison in that matcha.”

We are in the same group with 2 other people. At first everything was normal until I noticed the long eye contacts we have given each other. I chatted with her a couple of times alone about basic stuff but I couldn’t help but feel a small spark between us even thought it was surface level. As time went on with more group meetings, we vibed really well. I decided to text her personally just complimenting the work she’s done because I was genuinely impressed with her work and wanted her to be seen.

The texting was surface level and she took time to respond which I didn’t mind. There were times she didn’t get back to me and I didn’t mind that as we had a lot of going on with exams. Every time we met up for group stuff I didn’t act bothered because I wasn’t and gave her good energy. She reciprocated each time and that’s when she would text me back afterwards. She seems to be a reserved and emotionally guarded person so I understood at times where she needed space and I gave her that.

There was one meeting session where she gave me the most energy I’ve ever seen from her. We were playful and teasing each other, she mirrored my movements at times, i tested the waters and got close to her to see if she will back off but she didn’t and seemed to enjoy it. That moment made me realize maybe we can  
be something more.

I sent her a text after where I told her it was fun and gave a small joke. She seemed to appreciate that.

The next day in class I sat next to her, she kept playing with her hair and even gave me her phone to find something for her - which I didn’t expect as it felt like she trusted me and felt comfortable with me.

In the group chat, she hasn’t been engaged in it for the past two weeks but ended up name dropping me and answering for me when I was going to answer the text from another group member later that day. That invoked a spark in me and made me think she was thinking about me - her text even gave me an open for me to confirm it - like she wanted me to engage.

I ended up texting her personally and asked if she wanted to get coffee sometime. It took her a day to respond saying she couldn’t as she was busy with work, graduation coming up and a family member visiting the weekend. Of course I was disappointed but I understood her reasons as it was valid and respect her choice to prioritize what she has to do. 

I made a bold move a couple of hours after her response to get some clarity and I was also hoping if she could also give me some ideas for the next part of our project as I have always respected her ideas. 

In the back of my mind, I expected she wouldn’t pick up, and she didn’t. I just left it there and didn’t text her because I didn’t want to press her anymore and respected her choice.

It’s been a few days since and there has been silence between the both of us. I really felt that she would be interested in me but all this is telling me she wasn’t ready for things to be real between us. I still truly believe she enjoyed the vibe we had together and that’s why she gave me some good signs, but I guess it wasn’t enough for it to be real with me.

Ive been trying to get over it but it’s been hard and I’m not sure what to do. We have a presentation coming up in a couple of days and I was hoping she would at least reach out to see if we are good and for me to want to at least let her know we are good… but I guess things are going in a way where I’m sad to see it go.. 

Sorry just thought I would vent and idk if I’ll still have this up for too long but appreciate if you did manage to read all this yapping.. thank you",2,1745302309.0,self,0,0.75,False

""You are wrong and I am right....the ego´s favorite phrase. ""

""I can’t help but notice how peaceful and happy Eckhart Tolle seems compared to how mentally tortured Jordan Peterson appears. I'm a huge fan of Jordan Peterson, but when I watch JP, I get this sense of heavy energy, like Jordan Peterson is over-intellectualizing everything."" 

""..Number of times Jordan Peterson cried over a benzo addiction (benzodiazepine drug addiction) :-) ""

""I feel so uncomfortable when I listen to Jordan Peterson. It has always been so . I do feel tense . 
I can relate to Eckhart Tolle ´s inner peace""

""Reading the book Power of Now saved my life, thats my personal experience which I can depend on. You either get it or you don't.""

""99% of YouTube comments says Jordan Peterson is wrong on this one and I agree with that. Jordan Peterson needs to understand with heart not brain"" 

""Whenever i watched Eckhart Tolle speak, I've noticed that when a question is addressed to him, he always pauses before responding; allowing a time to both hear what is asked and to permit the emergence of a genuine response. Jordan Peterson has no conception of such a simple practice, which is why all Jordan Peterson has ever done is fill the world with noise.
""

""Before i was about to end my life in suicide , i came across the book Power of Now . And i know now that ,  one has to die before they die and then find out that there is no death . Thank you  Eckhart Tolle for saving my life .""

""This reveals everything about Jordan Peterson's immaturity - a fully ego intellectual man""

""We can be certain that Jordan Peterson is right because Jordan Peterson's daughter (Mikhaila Peterson) accumulated severe internal dysregulation that almost completely killed her."" 

""The True Middle Path: Integrating Both

✅ Eckhart Tolle’s wisdom can help those who are overwhelmed by overthinking—his teachings on presence are valuable.
✅ Jordan Peterson’s philosophy can help those who lack direction and purpose—his ideas on discipline and meaning are crucial.
✅ A balanced approach would be: Face challenges head-on (Jordan Peterson) but do so with Presence and Awareness (Eckhart Tolle).

Final Thought

Jordan Peterson is about engaging with life’s struggle, while Eckhart Tolle is about accepting and transcending struggle. The highest wisdom likely lies in integrating both—acting with presence and responsibility.""

""Jordan Peterson is pure intellect and the Power of Now is about awareness in the present.""

""The Scholar only knows theoretical knowledge, the True Master experientially KNOWS.""


""Wondering if Jordan Peterson has ever experienced still, quiet mind?
""
""Jordan Peterson sounds like a fool.  Eckhart Tolle is literally a man of higher consciousness.  Try to be like Tolle and less egotistic like Peterson.""


""You just have to look at both men (compare Peterson and Tolle). Jordan Peterson looks angry and in pain, Eckhart Tolle’s face shows an aura of inner peace and wonder. I know where to go.""

""Eckhart Tolle's simple realization is so far beyond Jordan Peterson logical thought and intellectual understanding""


""This is why i don't automatically trust ""certified"" psychologists such as Jordan Peterson. Many of them have low awareness-presence. ""

""Jordan Peterson's view on Eckhart Tolle clearly exemplifies how distant psychology is from understanding Presence.""


""I'm at a loss for words when a psychologist (Jordan Peterson) I've learned so much from, says that a man (Eckhart Tolle) who has literally saved my life, is wrong! 😞 ""



""Jordan Peterson has too much ego to understand Eckhart Tolle book The Power Of Now. It's the most incredible book that I have read. ""

""Eckhart Tolle’s book did more for me in 15 minutes than ANYTHING I’ve ever read by Jordan Peterson ever did.
Combined Eckhart Tolle's work with ACT therapy and it helped me shed anxiety like nobody’s business; while Jordan Peterson was waxing philosophic about some sea bug.""



""This is like the best example of the ego thinking too much and not even being able to understand Presence.""

""The degree to which Jordan Peterson needs Eckhart Tolle's teaching is unfathomable. ""

""When I hear Eckhart Tolle speak, I feel a sense of calm, peace, and a desire to help and listen to those around me. Jordan Peterson, on the other hand, triggers my individualism, my desire for power, feelings of scarcity and exclusion.

""
Jordan Peterson is so arrogant and wrong in the same time. Eckhart Tolle changed my life. Eckhart Tolle - Power of now book change a lot of people’s lives""

""Humanity is like a thirsty man in the desert; Eckhart Tolle’s teachings are the cool, crystal-clear water.  I hope you don't listen to this guy (Jordan Peterson) and taste that 'living water' yourself. ""

""Listen and watch Eckhart Tolle give a talk. Then observe how you feel after listening to him. Then listen and watch Jordan Peterson talk about something. Then observe how you feel. I’m pretty confident, nearly all people, assuming they at least have some openness or understanding of what Eckhart Tolle says, will feel a lot calmer. Jordan’s full of rage, anger, dissatisfaction. I feel sorry for the man (Jordan Peterson). And because of this, there is no way I would ever take advice from a man who, at least in my view, doesn’t experience actual JOY, the simple Joy of Being, in his moment to moment experience. This is what draws people to Eckhart Tolle. I can absolutely see how easily misunderstood he can be by many people. He teaches nothing new and he jokes about this, but unlike other ‘teachers’, he actually embodies what he teaches. ""

""I like Jordan Peterson. But Jordan Peterson is out of his depth here. The intellect cannot grasp Presence, because it is not about intellectual abstraction. You have to stop and allow the mind to become silent. You can’t think your way to an awareness of this. This is one of the major shortcomings in Jordan Peterson’s teachings. Jordan Peterson is disconnected from the body and the psyche, despite the fact he has a decent understanding of Carl Jung - but that understanding is garnered from the intellect, not so much direct experience. ""

""The only voice Jordan Peterson hears is his own. Even the way he looks at these guys, it’s like he doesn’t even see them. Jordan Peterson does this when he’s challenged, he either tunes them out or erupts. Jordan Peterson is the personification of living fully in your ego.""

""Eckhart Tolle Power of Now was the first book that awakened me. I came home on drugs basically in psychosis, way too young to even know the road I was on, and I had the fortune of coming across my brother in that state. He immediately turned on Eckhart Tolle. I'll never forget hearing that bell for the first time. It was the very first time my mind was still and he pulled me into the deepest presence I'd ever experienced at the time. I had no idea whatsoever what was happening then, but I spent days walking around in complete bliss KNOWING I had found something incredible although I couldn't for the life of me THINK 😂 what it was. That slowly saved and transformed my life. """,1,1745302225.0,EckhartTolle,0,1.0,False

What are Indies Going to Do?,"People can't afford a 145% markup on Chinese goods so the US export market is dead for all intents and purposes. Most vtuber goods are sourced primarily or with major components from China. That means that all merch runs which haven't shipped yet are going to get the full tariff mark-up going forward.

Let's focus on Cover since they're the biggest in the vtubing scene. What is Cover going to do? Sure, Cover will be able to collect on any sales they've already locked as it will still count towards recorded revenues but their primary export market is still dead. Anyone who has placed an order is going to get hosed by tariffs because it doesn't matter if it's pre-ordered, the importer is responsible for paying the tariffs and it's customs which is holding it. For the average Joe, what'll happen is that they will see their goods held until they pay the tariff, which they probably won't be able to afford because it's a 145% mark-up on declared value. Non-payment could lead to storage fees, interest fees, and seizure/forfeiture if they don't pay the tariff. Simultaneously, courier services such as DHL will continue to charge brokerage fees even if goods are held up in customs. Failure to pay these fees will lead to them being passed on to collection agencies.

Lives and events are all financed by merch runs and those are all planned months in advance with costs sunk. But you know what's REALLY bad? Talents are counting on merch runs to offset the cost of Lives which have already been paid for, which could leave them on the hook for tens of thousands of dollars.

Cover IPOed 2 years ago to finance an US expansion. They've been building their infrastructure in the US for 2 years and they've bought real estate and hired staff. How can Cover afford to keep these plans when the export market's dead? What's going to happen to these people? What's the plan?

I can't see any way forward but for Holo EN to collapse so long as the tariffs remain.

And what's happening to Cover is happening to everyone else as well because anyone who is sourcing from China can't export to the US. Phase Connect sells coffee from Canada - coffee isn't covered under CUSMA and is subject to a 25% tariff. Even if Phase Connect can source from other suppliers like Vietnam, (currently set at 10%, the original 46% suspended for 90 days) these tariffs are completely unpredictable, meaning no supplier is safe. Just today Trump announced a 3,403% tariff on solar cells from SEA - it's insane! How is anyone supposed to source merchandise and sell to the US? How are corpos? How are indies?

Without merch runs, corporate vtubing is dead, isn't it? Without merch runs, there are no Lives or events. If there are no merch runs, then streaming revenue is about to become the primary source of income for talents and corpos. But what does the corpo actually provide to justify the percentage take from the talent? How can the corpo afford to pay for their support staff without the income? The way I see it, the vtubing industry is about to collapse in the West and a lot of people are about to lose their livelihoods.

Things were okay until we had children, but she couldn't accept help from my grandmother (we lived with her), she had arguments and felt like my grandmother was trying to take over by checking on him at nighttime, offering to care for him or giving advice, so to keep the peace I agreed to moving into our own home, but now all family has been cut off and I feel isolated, everyone has told me to leave her but I don't want to destroy my children having a broken home.

I'll just list things that have happened over the years since (don't forget this is over the course of many years and doesn't cover everything):

-Stabbed me with a screwdriver.

-Hit me with and broken/bent multiple broom handles.

-Pulls my arm leg/hair.

-Emasculates me when I try to exercise (you're not a real man)

-Says I'm gay (nothing wrong with people who are ofc) if I spend too much time trying to make myself look nice in front of the mirror. (Constantly belittles and berates me.)

-Cut the strings on my Guitar & smashed my PlayStation on the ground during past arguments, if I did the same to her she would probably end up destroying the entire house. At the moment she threatens to break my computer, but I have learnt how to navigate and desesculate her temper.

-Has shoved my 70 year old Grandmother, almost making her fall over into the bath.

-Has threatened to kill the kids to make me suffer, threatens to drug my coffee, tie me up and kill the kids in front of me.

-Has actually grabbed the steering wheel and tried yanking it while the kids were and were not in the car.

-Used to smack the kids with spoons, now just uses it as fear and intimidation.

I’m not perfect either though. I've made mistakes, and have always told her the truth and apologised. I’ve lost my temper at times too and it kills me inside. I always apologize to the kids when I slip up, because I don't want to be that kind of dad and I know they deserve better. But I’m trying to grow, I want things to be different, especially for them, but it feels like she doesn't want a happy future or work on her trauma.

I know, after typing all that I already know the answer is I need to leave ASAP, it's just slightly complicated because my eldest son, last year was diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes, and the youngest are twins, eldest needs constant hospital trips.

Another concern is that if I go to a domestic violence place or child services, she attempt a ""smear campaign"" (been talking to ChatGpt for guidance on narcissism and it suggested reading other people's stories on Reddit, so I thought I'd add my own too to release the tension a bit.

I guess what prompted me to write this was last night, in front of my son, she slammed the pantry door which would have hit my head, but I'm already constantly on edge and hyper vigilant so I was able to stop it, after the kids went to bed she came out to the loungeroom where I sleep and because she thought I was texting tried to take the phone, said she bought the charger and and took that, then started whipping me with the chord, then she tried to hurt me between the legs by grabbing me there and pinching. I started recording her with my phone in my other hand, and blew it off as playful behaviour, and then she pulled her pants down while I was recording to stop me I guess?

Also my eldest son came out to get a drink of water and her automatic response is ""What are you doing, f-cking get to bed"", theres so much more but I'll leave it at that.

She's said stuff like ""No wonder your mother killed herself having a son like you"", she's said similar stuff to my dad and to my Auntie (my mum's sister).

I know what I need to do, leave so my kids aren't exposed to this horrible stuff. I feel utterly weak and pathetic for not leaving, but I've just felt paralyzed and being in constant state of stress, I've not been able to think straight, like I said my son has type 1 diabetes and he was on normal needle pens and insulin, but he changed to a pump which I don't fully understand so I can't just take him with me unless I get trained by the hospital staff.

Sorry for typing so much, I guess I just want someone to confirm for me that I need to leave, because I'm terrified, I just need to be brave and strong, and life can get better for the kids.

She may even get the help she needs to heal from her own trauma if she's forced to, but like I said I'm scared she'll tell lies to the authorities or even drag us through a painful and expensive court battle for custody, I don't want any of that, I just want the kids to be happy, I say let's do couples councilling so we can learn to communicate and work on our emotions so we can be better parents and help the kids regulate there emotions.

Anyway thanks for taking the time to read.

One was that if his ex reached out to him, he would tell me. He promised me. He has lied to me about things in the past and was not truthful to me about that relationship when it was happening (we were not fully together at the time but it still gave me anxiety because he lied up and down, thus making me feel like I had something to worry about. I believe he just didn't want me to stop talking to him if I knew he was also seeing someone else so he didn't tell me about her). He struggles with drinking too and makes poor decisions while under the influence.

A month ago I started to get the hunch that he was lying to me about drinking while visiting home, going to great lengths like leaving his phone at home so I could not see his location. He would not answer his phone starting at 7pm until 3pm the next day and just say he fell asleep early (which is uncharacteristic of him). This happened multiple times. When he got home I had an impulse to snoop through his phone to see. Not only did I find out that it WAS true, but I also saw he was messaging his ex.

She had reached out three days prior to catch up and also say how she thought ""fondly of their past time together"" and that ""it was special."" He agreed. He even said that when she was home for holidays they should grab a coffee. They texted back and forth for three days and he never once mentioned anything that would insinuate he had a girlfriend. I felt really betrayed, especially because he knew how insecure I felt about it (honestly, even making me feel paranoid for bringing it up from time to time).

There's a part of me that feels we can't come back from this. He said he was just shocked that she reached out and seemed so happy to talk to him. That he wished he had told me and that it was really not a big deal. He also was super upset I looked through his phone, which I feel bad about, but I wonder how far that conversation would have gone if I didn't see it. I said I was willing to forgive him but that the trust had been broken. I asked him to at least send her a message saying that even though he was happy to catch up, that he has a girlfriend and that he would not want to meet up with her. He at first agreed and comforted me. Now after a month he is suggesting he will not do it at all, saying I am being controlling.

I felt blindsided. He said he hadn't responded to her messages, but I (very grossly) caved and looked through his phone and saw he had changed her name and HAD in fact responded. I have not told him I know this information.

Basically I gave him an ultimatum to redeem the sitaution but he is blames me for looking. He says my ultimatum makes him resent me. Do I just have to accept that my primary boundary was betrayed multiple times over.I feel in shock and it makes me feel off. Am I the asshole for looking through his phone or is he in the wrong? What should I do?",1,1745301918.0,AITARelationship,0,1.0,False

We’ve been dating for almost a year now and I’m just honestly kind of in shock at how well it’s going. 

We had a really bumpy start, no 6 month honeymoon stage for us. Our first online talk before meeting in person was about stuff we learned in therapy. Our first few dates we had “arguments” about preferences and boundaries. We even broke up and stopped/started talking a few times during the first two months. We both have a lot of trauma and it took awhile for either of us to trust that the other person was safe to open up to. 

But now that we’re more comfortable around each other, I’m really shocked at how well it’s going. Like we have so much in common and we’re so compatible. We think very similarly. We’re both fairly balanced with our cognitive functions so neither of us overwhelms the other. We’re both really appreciate the strengths the other brings. I appreciate his kindness, gentleness, patience, and quiet acceptance and laid back go with the flow vibe. It helps me calm down when I get too stressed. He’s like my emotional life raft, keeping me calm and helping me process emotions. And I like to organize and plan, two things that really stress him out. I also tend to take over tasks he doesn’t want to do and I enjoy getting stuff done. So that takes a lot of pressure off him. And together we make each other laugh until we both almost cry. We have so much fun together going on hikes, watching shows, playing games, or just talking. 

I feel like we really understand each other. We’re at a point where it seems like we can read each other’s minds. He has said things exactly while I was thinking them. And has even reached out a few times at the exact moment I was doing something to ask me about it. Like imagine asking if the dogs need an appointment with the groomer to get their nails trimmed while I’m pulling into the parking lot to do that (and not having talked about it with him before that). Our reel algorithms align so we’re sending each other stuff the other person has already seen. I’ve also accidentally sent him one that he already sent me after not watching them yet. 

And I just really like him. He’s so sweet and romantic. He planned the best birthday for me I’ve ever had. He gets me my favorite chocolate just because. He sometimes wakes me up with breakfast in bed and a fancy coffee. He recently bought me the cutest stuffed animal and it was perfect and almost made me cry. 

Our love languages match almost identically, down to the percentage. He just took the enneagram test and we have the exact kind with the same wing. 

And I just feel so happy. I had no idea a relationship could be this easy or comfortable or fun. 

I’ll probably end up deleting this because it’s kinda gushy and private, but I don’t have many friends that are girls and I felt like I had to tell someone how I’m feeling. ",4,1745301635.0,isfp,1,1.0,False
1k4z7ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1k4z7ol/one_year_today/,One year today,"Just to share some insights on this milestone. Scrambled thoughts really. 

Knew I needed a more manageable lifestyle. Being the product of two poly addicts I can become addicted to anything very easily. 

I loved drinking, and I always will, physiologically. I can’t decline the way it makes me feel, but I remember more profoundly how it started to destroy myself. 

I was happy to be there, because it felt good. It didn’t matter that I hadn’t slept in 29 hours, all that mattered was that I had coffee and alcohol and my consciousness was still in tact. 

That is how I often found myself, when I finally pulled the emergency brake. 

For me there was no dialing it back from the level I was at, I was going to get to that point every time, because I wanted to. 

We all know the recovery periods. Mine were nothing short of a self-perpetuated hell. You could tell me that I just won a million dollars and I would still feel like I was just told I have 3 days to live. It was equal parts of being mentally depressed and physically in turmoil. 

So my best strategy is, to focus on the worst during moments of rose-colored glasses for cabernet sauvignon, or the bite of a harsh whiskey. 

Because I have control but I enjoy losing control when I am drinking, and life is more predictable this way. 

It feels like I have been lost for a long time, but not in the sense that I did not know where I was, but that I didn’t allow myself to learn who I actually am. Its as if I gained 10 years of wisdom that I missed out on drinking in one years time of being present and aware. 

But this will likely be my last post here for awhile. I don’t feel like I should be shouting this out in such an egotistical way. But I did want to celebrate this with both myself and others, for who it may help in some way. 
I hope you are kind to yourself, because you deserve it. 

Thank you for reading.

i (23 f) live with my sister (17 f) along with my mom and step dad who have 4 dogs, 3 cats, 2 rodents and 3 chickens. within the past 3 years since ive moved back in with my family, my mom, step dad, and sister have been traveling somewhat frequently compared to when i lived with my family as a child. we never went anywhere or did anything because we were broke. my family has been to canada, done a 3 week long road trip from montana to vegas, and a few other places. right now my mom and step dad are going from pheonix to new orleans on a road trip. my moms been gone 20 days and my step dad just left to meet her 2 days ago. ive never been on any of these trips as i have to work and havent been able to get to a good point financially to be able to take work off, so ive kind of just been their free pet sitter for the past few years and i dont pay a lot of bills here and i genuinely love my familys animals, so for the most part i dont mind. the only animal that i consider ""mine"" is our 14 year old poodle named jaxx, he was our childhood pet who was being borderline neglected (very high maintenance breed) and i took over his care to ensure he is being cared for well, so hes now considered my dog when it comes to the responsibilities in the house. my mom doesnt work, so she takes on 90% of the household and animal responsibilities, when my step dad and i are the only ones who work. my sister is a senior in highschool so she only has a few classes a day. 

when my fam goes on these trips it is completely my responsibility to care for all of the animals, do all the house chores besides take out the trash and put the dishes away (those are the 2 things that are my sisters responsibility) all while working almost full time in animal care and commuting 2 hours a day to and from work. we live rurally and its a lot of gas to and from work so i *was* spending a lot of time at my boyfriends house because he lives 30 minutes closer to my work. i agreed to coming by my house more frequently and sleep here more to help take the load off of my sister. so far the load has been on basically just me, even before my step dad left, and thats how it usually goes when my mom isnt home. i just spent my weekend at my boyfriends and just got back today after work. 

this house is disgusting. at least it isnt piss and shit disgusting, but dirt, dog hair, sink full of dishes, theres no room for new food in the fridge because nobody takes their leftovers or rotten food out when they arent going to eat it. my sister asked me to go to the grocery store in town today before i came home from work (again, live rurally, no grocery store, but she has a car she was given that my step dad pays the insurance on) so after work i went and got essentials and asked her to clean out the fridge a bit before i got home, she said she had already. i get home and the fridge is exactly the same as it has been (im like the only person who regularly cleans it and i usually eat out on days that i work so i barely ever have anything in the fridge besides coffee creamer. so im like dude, what the fuck. she then tells me one of the cats opened my bedroom door and then got locked inside of my room for god knows how long and shit in my dirty clothes hamper (probably pissed somewhere too i just havent found it yet). she washed the clothes... WITH the shit on them. so i go look at the clothes (that have been sitting with shit and water on them for over a day in the washer) and theyre speckled with cat shit particles and they also smell like mildew. im like dude? i appreciate u trying to wash them but is it not self explanatory to like try to get as much shit off of them as possible before putting them in the washing machine? apparently not. and im irritated, just got bit and barked at all day at work and dealt with *dog* shit all day, i now have to deal with my clothes being covered in *cat* shit and mildewy and our washer is out of commission until i can figure out the best way to rid it of cat shit so i can rewash and actually clean my clothes. and whole time shes on the phone with her friend and shes showing off how bitchy she can be to impress her friend, calling me a bitch, saying im overreacting, ect. im like okay dude, u can take care of everything u expect me to do for the next week until our fam gets home. i spent the next 2 hours picking up the slack that her AND my step dad did not do, because no way did the house fall apart this much in the 2 days hes been gone. he pays all the bills besides the electric i pay into, but most of these animals are his and it should be his responsibility when my mom isnt home to care for his animals, or at least my sister who is here full time. 

my dog eats ""special"" food because he has no teeth (its literally kibble and a can of wet food in a ziplock bag with some water in it mixed together) she knows this, i detailed exactly how to make it for him in text yesterday, as it turns out she hasnt fed him at all because she couldnt find a ziplock bag (literally step one) NONE of the animals had water, we have 3 water sources in the house, 2 big water jugs that have a water bowl at the bottom and a water fountain, all were dry. cats food that they all share is empty, litter boxes are overflowing, the gerbil and ferret had no food, dishes overflowing in the sink. i havent even checked on the chickens. the list goes on, and not to mention my cat shit mildew clothes.

like i said, every single time its just me and my sister at home EVERYTHING is left for me to do. at this point shes not even doing her 2 responsibilities of putting away the dishes and taking out the trash. and i get it, these arent her pets, but they arent mine either. and im paying more money than i usually would be to drive home more than i would be to help her with the responsibilities of these animals. everyone knows im trying to save as much money as possible TO MOVE OUT. the amnt i have been spending in gas to get from here to work is taking money from my savings to be able to move out. i do genuinely love and care for these animals and consider them partially to be my pets, but my sister is old enough to pick up slack for these animals too. school or not. the 3 hours she spends at school and the 10 minutes it takes her to drive there and back does not take up her full day, but me, a 23 year old who pays all of my own bills, contributes to household bills, is working almost full time an hour away, is expected to lose money to come back and take care of a household i have barely been at. not her who is already here before and after school everyday. she has been completely coddled by my mom and step dad. i never had a dad growing up, our step dad legally adopted her a year or so ago but has been her dad for years before that. her life has been a complete walk in the park compared to mine, ive NEVER gotten help financially. ive always been on my own and once she was born i was expected to care for her while my mom worked full time. because of that she has became such an entitled person. i know 14-17 is a hormonal time but i really feel like her bratty entitled attitude comes from being coddled and being around such shit fucking kids in this rural town my parents chose to buy a house in. 

at this point IDK what to do. last thing i want is to continue driving all the way back home everyday after work to do everything while she is borderline verbally abusive to me. but i also dont want my parents animals to suffer because of it, and it cant even really have ""my"" dog at my boyfriends house because hes kind of a shit head and i dont want anyone having to deal with his barking if im not there, which he doesnt do at home. also my boyfriends bed is like 3 feet off the ground and last time i brought him over he injured his leg by throwing himself off the bed because he thought i was leaving him there. but also if i leave him at my house my sister doesnt feed him and doesnt try to keep him separated from our big dogs who absolutely trample him because hes kinda blind and slow. like i said, its like this EVERYTIME THEY LEAVE. and i tell my mom and she says she ""doesnt want to get in the middle of it"" like ok! so shes not old enough to take on household responsibilities, but she is old enough to the point where u dont think its necessary to parent her. not to mention the DAY after my mom left my step dad left a single dish in the sink and she sent a picture to the family group chat thinking the dish was mine and said ""id really appreciate it if people could clean up their dishes when theyre done"" if i had done that at that age id get BACKHANDED. but nothing happened to her. like literally what do i do lmao. im trying to move out as fast as i possibly can and i have been SINCE i moved back in but i cannot get out fast enough.

## What is Nexonix?

Nexonix is an **automated online trading platform** designed to make it easier for everyday people to invest in crypto and other financial markets. It uses AI algorithms to analyze market trends and execute trades on your behalf. Think of it like having a robot day trader that doesn’t sleep, eat, or panic-sell.

The platform supports multiple asset classes, including **cryptocurrencies**, **forex**, **commodities**, and **stocks**, which is a big plus if you're looking to diversify your trading. The main idea behind Nexonix is to lower the entry barrier so even if you’ve never traded before, you can still participate in the market.

## Who Created Nexonix?

Here’s where things get a bit murky. Like many of its competitors (Bitcoin Code, Immediate Edge, etc.), Nexonix doesn’t publicly list a founding team or company name on its website. That’s not necessarily a deal-breaker, but it does raise a few eyebrows when it comes to transparency.

From what I’ve gathered, it appears to be developed by a team of fintech and AI experts who’ve worked behind the scenes of other algorithmic trading platforms. They’ve likely chosen to stay anonymous to avoid the spotlight or because of the nature of these largely automated platforms.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Nexonix Today](https://t.co/aeaJV7Ra1k)
## How Does Nexonix Work?

At its core, Nexonix operates using an **automated trading system** powered by artificial intelligence. The AI scans the markets in real-time, identifies patterns, and executes trades based on pre-set parameters. 

You can either let the algorithm do its thing in full-autopilot mode or set custom rules based on your preferences. For example, you can choose your risk level, the number of trades per day, and which assets you want to target. It even has **custom alerts** for market shifts and **real-time analytics** that help you stay informed, even if you’re not glued to your screen all day.

## Nexonix Pros and Cons

Let’s break it down, plain and simple.

### Pros:
- **Easy to use** – even if you’ve never traded before
- **Fully automated** – set it and forget it (sort of)
- **Supports multiple asset classes** – not just crypto
- **Mobile-friendly** – works on both Android and iOS
- **Demo account available** – test it before you commit
- **Custom alerts** – so you’re never caught off guard

### Cons:
- **No public founder info** – transparency could be better
- **Requires $250 to start** – not huge, but still a barrier for some
- **Some features locked behind initial deposit** – like advanced settings

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Nexonix?

Nexonix is **web-based**, so you don’t need to download anything to get started. It works smoothly on:

- Windows PCs and Macs
- Android phones and tablets
- iPhones and iPads

The platform is fully responsive, meaning you can switch between devices without losing your place. The mobile version is just as intuitive as the desktop one, which is a big win for people who like to check trades on the go.

## Nexonix – Supported Countries

Nexonix is available in **most countries worldwide**, with the exception of a few restricted regions due to regulatory constraints (like North Korea, Iran, and some U.S. states).

If you’re unsure whether it’s available in your country, the sign-up form will let you know right away. It automatically detects your location and either gives you the green light or prompts you to use a VPN (though that’s on you).

## Nexonix – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

Nexonix’s AI engine processes **massive amounts of market data** in real-time. It spots trends faster than a human ever could, which is what gives the platform its edge. Whether it’s price swings, volume changes, or breaking news, Nexonix reacts instantly. That’s huge in volatile markets.

### User-Friendly Interface

The interface is clean, modern, and **very beginner-friendly**. You don’t need to be a Wall Street pro to understand what’s happening. Everything is laid out clearly, with tooltips that explain each feature. It’s like having a mini trading coach built into the dashboard.

### Mobile Accessibility

Whether you’re commuting, chilling on the couch, or waiting in line for coffee, you can **trade on the go**. The mobile version is fully functional—nothing is left out. You can fund your account, set alerts, and even watch live trades happen in real-time.

### Customizable Alerts

This is a feature I personally love. You can set alerts for price changes, trade executions, or even news events. It’s like having a trading assistant keeping an eye on things for you, giving you a heads-up only when it matters.

### Multiple Asset Trading

You’re not stuck trading just Bitcoin. Nexonix supports trading in **crypto, forex, commodities, and even stocks**. That makes it a solid choice if you want to spread your risk across different markets. Plus, switching between assets is seamless.

## Is Nexonix a Scam?

Short answer: **doesn’t seem like it**.

Nexonix has a working platform, real-time trading features, and actual customer support. It’s not an obvious scam, but like with any trading system, you should start small and never invest what you can’t afford to lose.

The lack of transparency about the founders is a downside, but it’s not uncommon in this space. Just be smart—do your homework, use the demo mode, and test the waters before diving in.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Nexonix?

The **minimum deposit** to activate your account and start trading is **$250**. That’s pretty standard across similar platforms, and it’s used to fund your initial trades. You can deposit using:

- Credit/debit cards
- Bank transfers
- Some e-wallets (depending on your country)

Once funded, you get access to the full range of features.

### Nexonix Customer Support

Nexonix offers **24/7 customer support**, which is way better than most platforms I’ve tried. You can reach them via:

- Live chat
- Email
- Occasionally phone (depending on your location)

I tested the chat feature and got a response in under 3 minutes, which is solid.

## How do you start trading on Nexonix?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the Nexonix homepage and fill out the registration form. Just basic info—name, email, and phone number.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You’ll get a verification email. Once confirmed, you’ll need to **deposit at least $250** to activate your trading dashboard. This is also when you can set your trading preferences.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once your account is funded, you can choose between demo or live trading. The **demo mode** is a great way to test strategies without losing real money. When you’re ready, switch to live mode and let the AI take over.

## How to Delete a Nexonix Account?

If you ever want to bail out, deleting your Nexonix account is pretty straightforward. Just contact customer support and request account deletion. They’ll walk you through a quick process. Make sure to withdraw your funds before doing this.

So is Nexonix worth it?

For most people—especially beginners—it’s a **solid choice**. It removes a lot of the stress and guesswork from trading. The AI-driven automation, user-friendly layout, and multi-asset support make it stand out from the crowd.

NARRATOR: Rooftop of their crumbling apartment, past midnight. Neon clouds drift over the skyline.

MAYA (leaning on the rail, voice soft): Hard to believe we leave tomorrow.

ALEX (half‑smile): Harder to believe we stayed this long.

MAYA: You always said the city was a temporary tattoo. Looks permanent from up here.

ALEX: Ink fades. Memories, too—if we let the rain at them.

MAYA (glancing sideways): You plan to forget?

ALEX: I plan to shelve the bad chapters and reread the good ones on quiet nights.

MAYA: Like the night the power died and we ate melting ice‑cream by candlelight.

ALEX (laughs): And you insisted the shadows on the wall were prehistoric cave art.

MAYA: They were! You just lack imagination.

ALEX: I’m proving my imagination: I’m picturing us in a small town with more trees than sirens.

MAYA (teasing): And fewer rooftop philosophizers?

ALEX: One is enough if she keeps talking to me.

MAYA (turns to face him): That “small town” scares me more than these sirens. What if we pause and never unpause?

ALEX: Then we’ll enjoy the stillness—until we’re bored, and find new noise together.

MAYA (after a beat): You really think “together” travels?

ALEX: I packed it first. Right between hope and extra socks.

MAYA (laughs softly, then serious): Promise me something.

ALEX: Name it.

MAYA: When the sky feels too quiet, we climb whatever roof we find and look for neon clouds—even if they’re only in our heads.

ALEX (extends hand): Deal. But tomorrow we’ll need coffee strong enough to power a city, because the movers arrive at dawn.

MAYA (takes his hand): I’ll brew double. And leave one last note on this door: “Thanks for the stories.”

ALEX: Think the city will read it?

MAYA: Cities read everything. They just write back in echoes.

I hope everyone had a tolerable if not good day.  My highlight was the 1/2 a coffee cronut from Paris Baguette I ate in the brief bit I was awake today (hypersomnia flair.  Also Paris Baguette is a chain so there maybe one near you and I’m not just teasing you with delicious-ness you can’t get).

Anyways I come to you guys looking for recommendations for oxygen cannulas that don’t end up making your ears hurt.  My pulmonologist put me on overnight O2 a while ago because my pulse ox likes to take random quick trips down low, like down to the 60’s low.  It bounces back up real quickly and does this during the day too but for some reason he decided I needed 8 hours of oxygen a night after looking at an overnight continuous pulse oximetry study.  It’s not sleep apnea, not sure what it is though.

Anyways I’m looking for recommendations (or even better links) to O2 cannulas that don’t hurt your ear if you end up sleeping with your head side down.  Or a way to make it not happen.

1k4ytse,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1k4ytse/does_my_crush_like_me/,Does my crush like me?,"For a year, I had a crush on my senior, though we never interacted in real life. I wasn’t sure if he even knew I existed since I rarely stood out in class and barely engaged with others. Every time we crossed paths in the university hallway, I couldn’t even bring myself to look at him. Then, out of nowhere, I received a friend request from him. I was giggling, smiling, and screaming all at once. Of course, I accepted it immediately—but we never chatted.

Occasionally, I reacted to his posts, and surprisingly, he started reacting and commenting on mine as well. That made me think that maybe he knew who I was—at the very least, he knew I was his junior. Months later, he graduated, and sadly, I could no longer see him around. I still had a year before I graduated, while he moved to another city to prepare for his board exam (review). Even so, I continued harboring feelings for him, catching glimpses of his social media updates.

Six months later, he finally took his board exam—and passed! He returned to the university for their convocation, but unfortunately, I wasn’t able to attend due to health issues. By the way, he was friends with some of my classmates, particularly those who were irregular students (meaning they were also my seniors but had subjects they needed to take in my year level). He was also close to my regular classmates (which means we have the same subjects for the very beginning 1st yr - 4th yr). And when I say “friends,” I mean people who actually shared casual conversations, memories, and moments with him—unlike me.

Then, something unexpected happened. He messaged me the night after their convocation (held in the afternoon), asking, **""You weren't there when we had our convocation?""** I responded that I couldn’t make it due to financial reasons—which was a lie. The real reason was my health, but I figured he wouldn’t care, and honestly, he didn’t need to know since we weren’t close. He laughed and said, **""Ahh, that’s why I didn’t see you there.""** And I was sitting there thinking—**Hello??? You were looking for me??? in the crowd?**

I may be overreacting, but why would he search for me? I assumed he barely knew me beyond my name and the fact that I was his junior. I had no clue how to respond, so I just reacted to his message because, girl, **I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. My communication skills deserted me.** A few minutes passed, and he texted me again, saying he had something for me. **SOMETHING TO GIVE.** And your girl screamed again because for some reason Why would he have something for me when we had zero shared moments? Fast forward—he gave me his **reviewer.**   
  
Now, now, I know you might be asking, **""So what’s the big deal?""** But hear me out. If you were in his shoes, would you give your reviewer to a completely random junior, knowing you had other close friends in her section which you could have given it to instead? (where you know their personality, attitude and shared moments). Because, personally, I would have given mine to a close junior friend rather than someone I barely knew.

To make things even more interesting, he told me not to hesitate to ask him any questions about the reviewer. He encouraged me not to be shy and to reach out if I needed help with my studies. Which is obviously something my shy personality would never allow me to do.

I thanked him for the reviewer and admitted that I had no idea how to repay his kindness. Then, out of nowhere, he casually mentioned that he’d love to have coffee (my treat, of course!) and chat about anything interesting that had happened at the university while he was away preparing for his board exam.

When I asked him why he had given me his reviewer, he simply said he had heard that I was a kind person. 

After everything that happened, I assumed our conversation would come to a complete stop—but somehow, he continues to stay in touch >< like.... everyday....

She will not even throw in my one coffee mug if I’ve left it there (I’m never leaving more than maybe a cup, a plate, and maybe a piece of cutlery) - I’d literally rather she just not turn on the dishwasher and let me do it if that’s the case. It makes me want to be petty and not put her things in, lol, but that’s just a waste of a wash. I went to the gym today and had loaded like 10 things her boyfriend pulled out of her room before he left, but then forgot to turn it on - i left my coffee cup in the sink, and she started the load and just left my cup there!!

This all said, she’s a really great roommate 90% of the time so I try to just let this one thing go, it really doesn’t even feel worth bringing up because it’s so minor - it feels like it would be more annoying to make an issue of. I have to tell myself she’s not doing it from a place of trying to be annoying but it just drives me crazy for some reason! I also wonder if she ever notices how I put her things away.

I'm a single child with working parents so making sibling level bonds was also never an option. I'm an introvert & usually find it super duper difficult to make conversations with people I don't know. Not that I look bad or that I'm not involved in things I like. So for example, I got pretty obese in college but worked out my ass off in the last 2 years (after a bad phase of ghosting by a girl after we had a long talking phase of 6 months over phone during Covid times). Lost 20 kgs, built muscle & abs. Also, started playing tennis & haven't looked back since then. I also like to read. 

Anyways, I've tried dating apps as well & in fact had a few conversations going but this was around 1.5 years ago. Since then, I didn't use them. Even in school & college I was more involved into academics so never got the time for anything else. 

Now, when I actually want to date & test the waters, I seem to find no matches. Even when I do, I find it super awkward & difficult to keep the conversation going. Also, not being in college or school doesn't help since building bonds & meeting new people was a lot easier there.

Also, I somewhat feel like the lack of experience in dating doesn't work in my favor either. Like I did try taking this girl out & we went out for a coffee & a lunch. But post that, I just didn't know what to expect or ask for. She had already been in a relationship earlier & told that she's still keeping in touch with her bf, & keeps a check on his insta even after the break up (not sure what was that supposed to mean)

I actually wish I could meet someone who's as inexperienced in dating as me. Like people do in schools & colleges. Like what happens when two people who've never been out on a date with someone their entire lives feel like. Or when two people who've never been in a relationship before, have their first one. What problems do they face? How do they overcome them? How does it suddenly turn into love? I want to feel all of it & more.

I don't drink & I don't smoke. Pubs, bars & clubs aren't for me. I don't know what to do.

I went straight to Reddit, searched “why use a VPN,” and ended up in a bunch of free VPN Reddit threads where people were talking about this exact situation. I downloaded ProtonVPN right there on my Mac. It was free, no signup, and it worked fast enough for basic stuff. I stayed connected for the rest of the day and didn’t have any other weird login attempts. Later that night, I tried Windscribe too, and I kind of liked how it gave me more server options even with a free account. Both are always in the best free VPN Reddit lists for a reason. Now I use a VPN every time I’m on public Wi-Fi or even when I’m just casually browsing. It’s kind of like once you realize how open your traffic is without one, you can’t unsee it.

I didn’t see a ton of info in the usual free VPN Reddit threads, so I wasn’t sure what to expect. The install was easy, and I liked that it runs quietly in the background without spamming me with pop-ups. I tested it while working from a coffee shop and streaming a few videos—it didn’t slow down my connection, which was honestly surprising. But when I started reading more about it, a few people mentioned that AVG might log more data than other VPNs. That kinda defeats the point of using one, right? It reminded me of when I was trying to find the best free VPN last year and realized some free ones are safer than paid ones if you’re careful. So now I’m stuck wondering—has anyone used AVG VPN long-term? Is it actually private or just a decent add-on for casual users?

1k4yh0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1k4yh0e/shutting_down_the_moaners/,Shutting down the moaners,"I need a quick one liner to shutdown any moaning and unreasonable requests from my roommate. She moved in last month. Her sleeping pattern is non existent but she gets you to follow it and respect it regardless. One night, you'll have texts about how unreasonable you are using a microwave at 9:30pm, the next day shes up baking a cake until nearly midnight and you can't access the kitchen properly all evening, or sleep over the noise of her baking. One day, having a bath/cooking late is a mortal sin (like 9/10pm), the next evening her friend is over until 10pm/11pm at night. 

To make it worse, she has ridiculously sensitive hearing she has done very little about, but is also so deaf when she is on phone/has friends over she shouts, so you can barely watch tv/read/work without earplugs or headphones. She wouldn't buy her own ear plugs (low budget/money etc) so she waited 4 weeks for someone she knew to give her some to block noise. Now any noise she hears around them is the persons fault, because her earplugs should void everything. I told her to buy a draft excluder like I did to reduce noise/smell travel into my room. She won't buy it. She won't wear noise cancelling headphones like I do to block out her noise. 

Our kitchen kettle broke, so I moved mine into the kitchen temporarily and mentioned this was the one I bought myself for early mornings to reduce noise so i can make a coffee and late at night if i needed hot water bottles for pain so I could heat up water in my room. I explained until we got a new kitchen one, I'd need to use this one still. She hasn't replaced the kettle that broke for WEEKS despite agreeing it with the landlord. And is now moaning for me using my own, because it is still in the kitchen as a back-up for the broken one. We have a similar problem with the gate pass for the car. The one for the entire flat broke, that is kept in the flat for friends visiting/trade workers etc. I have the second card as the only person who in the property with a car, kept in my car as I have mobility issues and can need my car at any moment. I explained this. I leant her to the card to get a new one copied. She had it a full week whilst I was away to find somewhere. The place I suggested to get it done was too expensive apparantley (even with me offering to pay half), then didnt try anywhere else. Now every weekend she is requesting my gate card, wanting it kept in flat, and if I go out for the day without leaving it out, every weekend she is calling asking where it is. She even did this over the weekend, when parking was free outside on the street, bombarding me with me calls within an hour of me leaving, but not mentioning before I left she needed to borrow it. The most calls I have had in one evening is 11 over the parking card. Every weekend so far I've been home with my car shes requested the pass for some random friend who could easily park on street, or doesn't even need parking because they are simply picking her up.

There are other things, and I know I'd do things that annoy her. But like i said, I'm trying to find a solution for shutting this down as I've clearly enabled this to an extent. 

\- Not allowed to use bathroom lock late at night/in morning as the noise WAKES HER UP, wanted to not use light either, but declined doing this.

\- Not allowed to use kitchen past 9/10pm if she is sleeping, but she will cook at this time regardless

\- No male friends/overnight guests, which was never discussed, but she kind of decided, every guest she has brought around since has been male. 

\- Random sleeping pattern, she naps in day, sleeps from 8pm/8am, with naps still in between. She doesn't work, and seems to think her pattern needs to be respected, literally making comments about me getting up earlier than her for WORK because it disturbed her.

\- Cooking until past 11pm (starting at 6/7pm so we're talking 4/5 hours of cooking too) because she fancied baking a cake big enough to feed 4/5 people, for one person. But complaining if you use microwave at 10pm.

\- Having loud phone calls or being loud when friends are over, to point you need headphones/earplugs to block her out (you can hear through walls) sometimes until early hours, or during days i'm WFH so it's really disturbing. Even in evening, if she has a friend over, I can hear her from my room, with door closed unless I have headphones in, she openly admitted she was shouting on phone until 2am last week, when she was pulling me for using the kettle at 9pm!

Yeah anyway, as you can see this is getting stupid/ridiculous now, so I'd like to shut it down asap. I need to make it clear that I acknowledge her requests, but I am not going to always accommodate to them essentially.

Hey everyone! I’m looking to establish a small group of dudes in their late 20s to mid 30s to hang out with on a consistent basis in the downtown/west end area. I feel like a lot of us are in the same boat in that we have friends, but they’re either scattered across the city, prioritizing their careers or families, or are just singular friends that aren’t part of a larger group, if that makes sense. While I love a one-on-one friend hangout, I feel like I’m also missing that group dynamic. I’ve tried to join a few groups with a similar intent in the past, but they seem to lose momentum or fizzle out - so I’m hoping to change that by starting one myself! I’m also in my mid 20s and I’m truly tired of halfass friends and a few friends that fizzled out

Things I envision our friend group doing (especially once the weather gets nicer!): patio sangria, going to jazz bars, AGO, coffee/matcha yap sesh, or watch sports at a resto or bar.

I was thinking of  creating a Whatsapp group for anyone who is interested so we can have a single place to plan meetups!

I'd like to preface this by saying that I eat clean and enough, drink lots of water, and exercise regularly. I'm about 5'5"" and 125lbs ish.

The most obvious symptom that I am very intolerant to changes in temperature. I recently stepped out into the sun on a high of 75 degree day and immediately felt like I was going to vomit and pass out. My vision started to cut out so I had to sit down in the shade. That is normal for me. It usually takes at least 45 minutes to pass.

With that is excessive sweating. I do not know anyone that sweats like I do, I am not kidding. Like beads of sweat dripping from my nose when the coffee shop is a bit too warm. Sweating through my shirt and pants. I recently spent a holiday in the Mediterranean. It wasn't hottest months, but even at 80 degrees people often assumed that I had just gotten out of the water. I don't know how to properly convey it, because it is so comically dramatic. I sweat a lot. Whatever you are imagining, it is more than that. I'm a good sport, but sometimes it really embarrasses me.

As well as that, something I've recently learned is that I am incredibly sensitive to altitude. I live at sea level, so this hasn't come up for me before this year. I visited Colorado (6k elevation) this year and was lightheaded, nauseous, and slept the entire time. I felt like I was high and had the flu at the same time. Later this year, I flew to Mexico City (7-8ish k elevation) and got so sick I considered visiting the ER. I was lightheaded, could not walk in a straight line, completely disoriented, and vomited every 5-15 minutes for probably 7 hours straight. I know altitude sickness is something that can happen, but both times none of my traveling companions experienced anything beyond a light headache. I don't know why I was so affected and I'm concerned about potentially traveling to even higher elevation locations in the future.

Other things:

\- I exercise regularly, but have found that regardless of how I fuel my body, I tend to feel deeply fatigued for days or even weeks after high intensity cardio like cycling (I do majority body weight work outs now)

\- sometimes when I'm falling asleep, I feel like my bed or my body is vibrating internally

\- salt cravings

\- incredibly painful periods and ovulation. Also have had a couple spells of cysts bursting

\- family history of Graves, hypothyroidism, diabetes, heart disease

\- high cholesterol (both kinds) despite a vegan diet low in saturated fats

\- low blood pressure

\- high-ish iron levels

\- got blood work done through my PCP and everything looked normal ish aside from the above, I was a bit low on D and now I take a supplement.

What can I say that will give me a second chance ?,"I (32f) am infatuated with my former supervisor (35M). We had a chemistry while I was working at the company and at one point we almost kissed. We exchanged eye contact for a long period of time and then he leaned in to kiss me. The moment was my every fantasy that I had envisioned for months!!!! But, I felt really insecure and shy at the time because it was at the end of a long shift and everything caught me so off guard. I basically stopped the kiss from happening when I started to tear up (I am very inexperienced with kissing men and I felt so helpless) causing him to immediately pull back. 

*As context to the tearing up aspect, we were discussing some emotionally heavy topics so it felt natural. Also please do not judge me for being shy at my age, there are cultural aspects to this. 

We were okay after that and neither of us brought up the incident. We even exchanged numbers before I left the company. I had to leave but kept thinking about him for months over and over. 

Eventually a year after the contract ended,  I decided to call him and just confessed all the feelings I had without trying to overwhelm him. I mentioned how I loved his masculine energy and his compassion and that I missed him. I was nervous so I came off more direct than I anticipated. 

Overall, he seemed like he had already moved on initially but also seemed kind of interested (he seemed touched by what I was saying, was going along with my flirtations, offered to meet for coffee). He said he needed to think about it since he didn’t want this to interfere with his reputation at the company. He even offered to meet for coffee. In my mind I was thrilled about it and waited a couple of days to hear back from him. Eventually, I got a text from him saying that he thinks it would be in both of our best interests not to meet up. 

We had a short call after that and I was too flustered to get the true closure I needed. I ended up asking him if this would affect his being my reference for a future employer. The call ended when I said I didn’t want to take up too much of his time. 

Now I feel lost. I know this sounds strange but in that final call, he seemed open to “negotiation” and as if he wanted to keep talking and I keep wondering if I should have explored his hesitations more. Of course I am not trying to push his boundaries, but that last call did not go well and I would at least like to meet up to talk everything over in person. 

Either way I am 100% sure he was interested in me at work, we made eye contact VERY frequently and our conversations were long. Whenever we all were in group meetings he would sit right next to me. He opened up to me about a lot and as I was leaving he gave me his most cherished book from his collection. 

My thoughts are that he is worried I would tell anyone if we did get together because in our line of work it can be seen by some as unethical and he is very ambitious trying to get promoted to the higher corporate positions. His work means a great deal to him. 

At the same time, I know for a fact we have a great chemistry and that he is missing out on an amazing time. It’s been a few months since the call happened now and I’ve made NO contact at all.

You will never acknowledge or see what you did to me but abandoning someone you are supposed to love is not it. Cheating is not it. Then accusing someone who you know is by herself with no car or anyway to go in a town where I don't know many people, and am a loner is not it. Saying I cheated on you knowing I would never. I was only with you from Oct - now, and I will never be with another. 

Saying I ran my mouth to someone I cut off when you asked me, and you knew you didn't come around and they were the only ones who I could get help from. Did you know that I went without eating for 3 weeks? Did you care?? No you didn't because you didn't come around. You didn't take me anywhere until night. I still don't talk to her. I will go over when she is asleep and charge my stuff and leave. But I guess keep the dog under lock and key. Why be seen with me, fat, old and an embarrassment?

Couldn't take me anywhere? Around friends, no they would pick on you?  Why pursue me anyways? Why? Why break down my walls just to do this? You had others waiting on you. You pursued me, knocked my walls down, deserted me for others, threw breadcrumbs at me, broke promises, hardly ever came around, accused me of leaving, cheating and spreading shit around. Why? 

Did you really love me, did you try to help me? I had to beg you to see me. I only wanted you. I loved you. I wanted to be with you. You didn't see all that because you didnt  want to. You won't see that you broke the woman who thought you were her North Star. The love of her life the one that she chose, the one her heart chose. The one she still loves. If I didn't love you or devote myself to you I wouldn't have stayed as long as I did. I wouldn't have degraded myself begging for a little attention and affection from you. I would have left long ago if I didn't love you. I LOVE YOU so I stayed. I wanted to be with you. 

You proved that you didn't want to be with me. But I hear you had someone else so why would you. You lied to my face about knowing her. She was at your house the weekend you went NC. Your mom posted her being there. So NC was for her? You were also seen at the hotel downtown with her. You know the one we went to. Get rid of the fat, old embarrassment and make it all her fault. 

I understand you felt hurt as well. What I don't understand is I apologized for the first time and all the times you said you felt some sort of way. I apologized even if I didn't get how I did such things when I rarely saw you. You put me in NC then forgot about me. You hardly came to see me. I became a side bitch with as often as you saw me. 

I love you so I asked for a second chance after healing. You rejected me. That I don't understand either. You have given women who have done worst to you a second chance, but not me. The one who you pursued , who rode with you, who helped you, you adored you, you saw you, who never raised a hand to you, who didn't argue with you, who never gave you a reason to be scared, who never asked for anything but your time and attention. You couldn't give me a second chance. The woman who truly gave you her heart and wants a future with you. So why do I question you affection and love? That is why. I went to get better to be better for me and for you. But I was rejected. You were told all this stuff that I was supposed to have said, problem is, nothing was about you. None of it. It was all about me and the conversation that was had that day the morning of the storm, your mom was telling me what to say to her. I would show her and she would approve and I pressed send. She told me everything that the neighbor supposedly said. It was all true but all about me. It was what we had told your mom. The lady who supposedly told your mom all this has been contacted and she said that the neighbor never told her anything and she had not seen or talked to her since last year. You told me not to talk to your mom and now I know why. She really hates anyone you date doesn't she? Or does she only like one? The one that was there that weekend? 

With you, you were my everything. I wanted everything with you. I wanted love, I wanted fun, I wanted peace, I wanted spontaneous, I wanted a life with you. I never wanted you to change. I fell in love with you. I wasn't going to put unexpected regulations or anything on you. I want you. To live a life full with you. I wanted cuddles, dinner dates, coffee dates, river walk dates, just to be with you. Picnics, camping, rides down a dirt road, watching the stars, a life full of laughter with you. I wanted to try again, forgetting the bad in the past, the NC, the ignoring, all of it. I wanted to start over. I want communication with you. I want to explore my kinks with you. I want me and you.

I have nothing left, I'm where I feel you want me. I can't speak my truth anymore. I have told you the truth, but you choose not to believe me. One day you will see and maybe you will then think of me and realize that someone did love you, was true to you, was loyal, respectful, faithful and honored only you. That she was real and everything she stood for was real and that she had been 100 with you.

I have retreated back to my darkness and shadows. I'm safe here. I have lost my voice and honestly I have basically gone mute. I deserve to be here since I am a villain but I can't get you to see my feelings or POV. I have apologized for everything and told the truth and I'm still the bad guy. So I will stay here and hope to die and continue trying because I hurt the man I love. The only man that I truly loved and wanted a life with. I pray everyday for the Lord to take me home so that connection will break and you will be free. I am destroyed and feel everyday of breaking the connection. I pray for another chance but you hate me and that will never happen. I can't live like this. I never once hated you for anything. I forgave you for it all and kept loving you. But to know that you hate me and for something that I didn't even do and you won't listen or believe because someone close told you. I would rather die and put myself out of your misery. 

I do love you, I do miss you, and you will be the last man to receive my love and my heart. I'm so sorry I was such an embarrassment, a hassle, a chore, not worthy and not enough for you. I'm so sorry you feel like I manipulated you because I never did. I wish you could see that you were literally only around me like 15 times in 2 months of that. I literally stayed in my house around no one and was secluded because I cut off who you wanted and had no one. NO ONE, not even you. I have been so lonely and all I wanted was you. I know now I am worthless. I am unseen, I am unheard, I am dead inside. The light has gone. The feelings I felt after healing......gone. Please live and if anything ever happens to me, I pray you never hear. I don't know if you would care anyways. It's not like I am someone who matters to you in your world. If I did I would have been worthy of a second chance like the others. 

Until I take my last breath, I love you and I miss you. I will pray for the best for you and nothing for me. As long as you see me the way you do. This is where I belong. There will never be another until my passing. You are it, you are my one.

To put it simply, my family aren’t at all good people so her family and herself have been nothing but the sweetest and most supportive and including people I’ve ever met. Meeting all of them, dating my girlfriend, we’ve talked countless times about getting married, I know the exact day and year, and where I’m going to propose, and even the ring. And we already know we want to get married at her grandmas beautiful farm B&B. There’s just so many things I’ve learned to love about life, coming from someone who had to be hospitalized for certain mental reasons, it’s such a crazy difference, and now I’m terrified of dying or her. I’m so scared I won’t be able to see her in her wedding dress, laugh and play with our kids, drink our coffee in the morning on our porch of our future house, etc all that cheesy stuff. Time really is moving way too fast and all I want to be reincarnated or whatever happens in the afterlife and be with her every single time, because my biggest fear really is just being without her.

We have similar interests like video editing, and probably a similar sense of humor too. At first, I was planning to ask her out, but then her exams came up, so I didn’t. After that, my own exams started, and I got caught up as well.

Around Valentine’s Day, I finally asked her out. She said yes, but rescheduled. On the day we were supposed to meet, I went to the college canteen and waited for about half an hour. The canteen is mostly made of glass, and while waiting, I saw her outside walking with one of her guy friends (not her boyfriend). That kind of threw me off. I figured maybe she wasn’t really interested and thought about heading home. As I was going to the counter, I ran into her.

I was a little pissed, but I still asked if she wanted to grab something. She said no, that she was heading home in a few minutes. Later, I messaged her saying maybe there was some miscommunication, and she replied that she was with her friends on a different floor. I said, “Alright, maybe we can plan it for another day.”

That same month, we had a pretty nice chat for 20–30 minutes. I tried to keep the convo light and funny, especially since I’m more on the introverted side. I figured maybe I should try to build a connection first. We started studying together occasionally on Discord and kept texting for a month or so. At one point, I asked her if she was dating anyone—she said no. So I started giving her hints that I liked her.

This month, we’ve been meeting a bit more—just quick interactions, a few minutes here and there. I decided to sketch a portrait of her as a way to express my interest, and when I gave it to her, she said it looked really good. I reminded her about that coffee we had talked about, and she said, “Yeah, we can go for coffee.” She even mentioned she was free the next day.

So the next day, I texted her twice to check in about the plan, but she said she was with her friends. Later that night, she messaged me saying, “My friends really liked the sketch—and they even said they want to meet you.” I asked, “So who’s arranging the coffee then?” and she said she would. I said, “Okay, cool.”

But I don’t know... She does reply to my texts, but sometimes she just leaves me on seen, and I honestly don’t know what to make of it. Our conversations feel like they’re not really going anywhere—like there's no friction, no build-up. It just feels stuck.

Now her assignment submissions are coming up, and I’m back to wondering—do I just keep waiting again?

It’s starting to feel like I’m not really a priority to her. I know I can’t force anything, ",0,1745297551.0,TwentiesIndia,3,0.5,False

The entire planet is a living office, populated mostly by clones of intern John Oaf, who has already been dead for 150 years. He was selected as the cloning template because he spilled coffee on the visiting CEO of the time on a branch office world.

His memories were modified to serve as a perfect cookie cutter template for customer service. Clones are used instead of machine intelligences due to costs and the customer demand for a ""human"" element.

All office spaces and cubicles are air conditioned, which supplies aerosolized caffeine to make the Johns more efficient. Johns are given 7 hours of sleep everyday to ensure peak efficiency during the other 17 hours of work. They sleep in pods next to their office spaces, where nitrous oxide is used as a sedative to force them to sleep, even under the effects of caffeine.

During the cloning process, all Johns are implanted with the modified memories and a nutrient and waste tank, removing the need to eat, drink, or take bathroom breaks. The tanks are cleared and refilled each time in the sleeping pods. Vitamin B12 is also administered in sleeping pods to reduce wear and tear from nitrous oxide use, however, the wear and tear is inevitable, and clones will eventually lose mental capacity, reducing their efficiency.

Johns vary in lifespan due to variations in the cloning process. Some clones are more stable, resistant to nitrous oxide poisoning and age less, increasing their operational life to a decade or more. Some clones can also become ""disagreeable"". These clones are taken away and dissolved, their organic matter to be recycled into new Johns. The average John has a service life of about 6 years and are all recycled once they are no longer efficient employees.

1k4y1iz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k4y1iz,"Spilled milk coffee on just renewed down doona – looking for advice on options, please (pics attached)","Hi folks,

I’d love some help figuring out how to clean a pretty decent splash of milk-based espresso coffee from my featherdown doona (duvet). I've attached some photos for context — the damage is… not subtle.

I just spent a few hundred bucks getting it professionally cleaned (they did a full down extraction, laundering of both the fill and cotton shell, etc.), so I’m really hoping to avoid going through that again if I can.

The one positive about this situation is that the spill landed on a section of the doona that’s relatively light on feather/down fill. So I'm cautiously (perhaps naively) hoping that it might be possible to 'spot' clean or otherwise treat this area without ruining the down loft.

I've heard that down bedding generally shouldn’t be cleaned like regular bedding e.g. in the washing machine/dryer? As I understand it, moisture can ruin the loft, cause clumping, and even make things mouldy if not dried properly. So I want to tread carefully.

I'd really appreciate any advice on:

- Whether I’m just wasting my time and should just bite the bullet and pay for another professional cleaning

- Or, if home cleaning is viable, how I should go about doing it (e.g. product suggestions, cleaning/drying techniques, etc.).

Thanks in advance. I really appreciate you taking the time to read this. ",2,1745297065.0,laundry,1,0.75,False

I’ve been through a lot of crazy things, pero ito talaga gusto ko lang ilabas. Tapos na ‘to, and my mom is dating someone else now, but this happened Dec 2023.

Backstory muna: My mom had me at 17. Never ko nakasama ng matagal ang bio dad ko, and growing up, I’d always meet different guys around my mom. Ako pa yung mag-guess kung jowa ba niya or what. Isa ‘to sa reasons bakit sobrang toxic ng relationship namin—pero that’s a long story.

Now, the main story:
December 2023, we were in a beach for a family trip. So nag girls’ night out kami—me, my cousins, and my mom (early 30s siya, I was still a minor). We met a group of guys sa bar, and they asked to join us. I was quiet kasi awkward—kasama ko mom ko eh.

One guy, let’s call him M, was 25. Chill lang kami, then sumama yung girl friend nila (super bait, girl’s girl talaga). I mostly talked to her. Pero si M, may mga hirit sa akin—pa-cute, pa-joke. Basta he was showing interest sa’kin. I’d just laugh awkwardly, lalo na nung nalaman nilang I was my mom’s daughter. Di sila makapaniwala. My mom told them I was a minor, pero I asked her not to say my age kasi I hate being treated like a literal kid. So clear tayo. He knew I was a minor.

Later that night, nagsuka isa kong kasama so we had to help her. Then may moment na hinawakan ni M yung waist ko. I felt uncomfy. Hindi ako mahilig sa landian, lalo na sa 10 years older sa akin. Then habang nauuna mom ko and cousin ko, M held my hand. My mom saw and said, “Hoy, ano yan?” in a joking way. He let go agad.

Nag-followan kami lahat after on IG and FB. A few weeks later, I posted about missing art galleries—nag-reply si M, nagyaya. I said sige pero deep down, di ko balak ituloy. Alam kong date na ‘yon, and I was uncomfortable.

Fast forward, l my uncle’s first movie was premiering and we invited as many people as we can to support. Ininvite namin si M. Di siya nakapunta. The next morning, 5 am, my mom wakes me up. “Andito si M, hinahanap ka.” Ha?! Di ko nga siya close. Nasa bahay siya bigla? Gulat na gulat yung diwa ko talaga. Bagong gising ako n’on at bumaba. Sobrang awkward. Di ko alam kung anong nangyayari. Nalaman ko na he felt so bad he couldn’t attend the premiere night so he asked my mom to party na lang after kasi his working time did not permit him to go sa premiere night. Bale ang nangyari, my mom, tito, and some of the main production team of the movie went to a KTV. Okay? Ang tanong, why is he here? And I feel my privacy was invaded by my mom inviting him inside our house.

He ended up coming with us to the awards night too. Same day. When we were at the mall, bago pumasok, bumibili kami ng food, tapos tinanong niya bakit di natuloy yung gallery namin. Sa venue, katabi ko siya. Then we went Pampanga, nagkape kami with the same group—umupo ako sa couch pag-uwi, and M suddenly laid down sa lap ko. WTF. My mom saw. I was weirded out. The next day, she asked if I liked M. Sabi ko, no. I was just going with the flow, pero deep down, I hated all of it.

Then boom—3 meetups later, si mom na nilalandi niya.
I wasn’t mad because I liked him. Never ko din syang nagustuhan—but ang weird. How could they both be okay with this? Nakakainis.

Months later, sa birthday ng mom ko, M organized a full-on family dinner for her. Morning pa lang, sinama niya ako maghanap ng gift. Over coffee, he said, “Alam mo naman bakit ko ‘to ginagawa diba?” I said, “Oo,” and went quiet. Alam ko he meant “gusto ko si mama mo.”

Before dinner, we talked. He asked about my dad—how I never had a stable father figure. I opened up about not liking my stepdad either, and how I didn’t want my mom to date yet—bagong break pa lang siya with his husband. Plus, ang bata pa ni M. 25? My mom has 3 kids, two of them under 6. I don’t think he’s ready for that. When you look at their life, ang layo talaga. My mom has been in different relationships, got married, has kids, and is even going through annulment. On the other hand, we met M with a girl he’s in a situationship with and goes to pobla. Ang layo ng standing diba? Honestly, sa age niya, parang kuya ko na siya. Basta ang dami kong issues. Don’t attack me. Wala akong problema sa age gap, I just didn’t think I’d be so uncomfy with it pag sa mom ko na nangyari. Badtrip ako that time because she promised me she’d fix our relationship nung naghiwalay sila ng asawa nya yet she’s entering another relationship na mas complicated dahil nga ako ang unang pinakitaan ng interes. Anyway, I couldn’t eat at dinner. I just messaged my mom, “Congrats, gusto ka niya,” and watched her smile since nasa harap ko lang siya.

We argued about it for weeks. I told her what happened in the beach. Even my friends and trusted relatives thought it was weird. She kept saying, “Di naman weird yung age gap”—but that’s not the point. How we met him was weird. Pero di niya pa din daw magets bakit weird. Dense ka ba? Or bulag-bulagan lang? Sinasabi pa niya na kaya ayaw ko because I like M. Lol. Kung matino kang tao, di ka papatol sa nanlandi sa anak mo. Vice-versa.

Also, one day, nakita ko sila sa house—si M nakahiga sa lap ng mom ko. Same position na nakita niya sa amin dati. As in copy paste. FF. Hinayaan ni M na ‘di na ligawan si mom because I didn’t like it. But part of me felt guilty kaya sabi ko ituloy nya. Also because my mom was showing to me na sobrang nasasaktan sya. In short, nag papaawa. Sorry not sorry, gusto kong sapakin sa mukha mom ko ng sobrang lakas nung time na yun. Sobrang paawa niya sa’kin nakakainis. 

I’ve cried several times about this. I felt so betrayed by both of them. They never had a label dahil hindrance “daw” ako dun. But basically they still dated. I wasn’t the reason they cut off though. Behind closed doors, he was manipulating my mom and laging nagpapasundo sa mom ko to drive to him whenever he had anxiety attacks na kala mo sakanya lang umiikot ang mundo ng nanay ko. Tapos isang beses nag beg sa nanay ko para bumalik sya at nagkamali daw syang sumuko sa kanya (cause we had a month na he cut us off out of nowhere dahil pagod na daw siya) My mom kept all of this from me dahil ayaw nya ng madagdagan yung inis ko kay M. Eventually, I gave her an ultimatum: It’s him or me.

That’s when it ended. I hate M because he went off everything the wrong way. I hate that my mom didn’t listen—same as before, when I told her not to marry her now-ex (which she admitted to me that also regrets not listening to me about it)

Anyway, I’m so tired of dealing with my mom’s love life. I’m so tired of dealing with the aftermath of her choices in life. Like, I get it—she’s trying to find herself after being a housewife for years. She’s even partying to discover mga new trends since housewife nga siya and mom to kids. But reality speaking, she’s not a teenager anymore. I’m not discouraging her from trying new things, but she doesn’t realize how her choices affect her kids. Lalo ako na malaki na. Lagi niya pang sasabihin na sana nakinig siya sa mga sinabi ko, and that I’m right. Tapos same cycle ulit. Parang ako pa nanay niya. Tangina talaga.

This is going to get downvoted but I don't care I just need to vent. 

I'm a final year and unfortunately applying for jobs hasn't gone as planned. I only wanted prestigious MBB consulting and was extremely bitter for not getting an elite internship in my second year. 

I was unsuccessful again when recruiting for MBB in final year and have unfortunately had to reluctantly accept an offer for a low prestige industry role. The pay is decent in a low cost of living region and the money goes a lot further than a high salary in London. 

The company has a few ex-consultants, but in my eyes these are just the guys who couldn't hack it at MBB and washed out into an inferior job. 

My prospective firm has been very welcoming and everyone there has said they're really looking forward to me joining, but I'm literally only joining them because I couldn't get the MBB offer I wanted unfortunately. 

They've invited me to a dinner with the wider team which I declined and made up an excuse for because I was just so disappointed over how my career has gone and that I've ruined everything and have wasted all of this effort over the past few years to still not get into MBB. 

They have some industry award nights which are black tie events for various firms across the industry to celebrate various high performing employees, and they've invited me because I still haven't met the wider team despite having been invited for coffee on various occasions. 

They will be taking pictures at this event and I just don't want to attend and have my picture taken because they post on LinkedIn (as they have done every year) and I don't want people I know finding out how far I've fallen off compared to the goals I've had to end up in a mediocre position. 

I know this sounds stupid but I've been getting deranged with regret and resentment especially over the past few months and need some clarity on what to do. 

It would be weird if I said ""please don't post any pictures of me"" but if I cancel again they will assume I'm just not interested since I feel one of them is getting that vibe already because they've become less enthusiastic with me. ",0,1745296939.0,ICAEW,1,0.09,False

It was a factor, along with her naturally authoritative personality, that factored into our decision to let her go straight into domme training. She refused to spend anytime as a slave of course-but we've let plenty of applicants walk because we don't think they'd make decent Dommes  without some time as slaves."" Mary was talking to me but side eyeing Jasmine. Ji was listening intently, too.

I'd been familiarizing myself with the requirements for the hierarchy of QOM's organization. Nora told me Sheila and Layla were certified as the lowest bottom slaves, and there was an indefinite hold on any further advancement within QOM's ranks. This was because they both stepped down from leadership positions in the fetish world, Sheila citing ""stress"" and Layla for undisclosed reasons. Until they expressed a clear desire to lead again and QOM did a thorough evaluation, they'd remain the lowest Betas when they worked with QOM. Mary asserted this was done with their own good as well as those of others in mind.

Nora and Sandy, despite troubling pasts, behavioral problems, and trauma induced mental issues, were already stepping up to leadership positions while Sheila and Layla were still in charge. Stacy Kealoha, who was often on the Perseverance set, was impressed by the two young women's poise and gravitas when they were given authority and responsibility.

She felt the bratty behavior that enraged Sheila (But according to Lara, amused the rest of the Perseverance cast) was when they were treated like menials, Nora told by Sheila to sit in the Ready Room all day studying scripts, Sandy being the set gofer, when she had more to offer than fetching chicken orders.

I giggled when Dave told me about the time they'd barged into his office in tied off shorts and daisy dukes, clearly at the instigation of Sandy. She'd plopped her denim clad half breed butt on his desk and sucked her finger. Then she told ""Daddy Davey"" two hot little girls would be very ""grateful, if he granted them a limo and a thousand dollar allowance, each.

Dave has a public persona of an Uber masculine, unrepentant misogynist. The Perseverance women insist it's an act, he's a big softie deep down. Dave admitted he was tempted,  but turned them down, he wasn't going to take advantage of two troubled young women just because he could. He did give them the limo, allowance and a spa trip. He also gave them a chaperone, a strict curfew, and rules forbidding bars or drinking alcohol.

Lara laughed at how livid Sheila was in Dave's office. She felt even though he didn't have sex with them, he still rewarded their bratty behavior. Dave smirked and said ""Baby sister's got nerve."" At Sheila's baleful glare, he sobered and said any future road trips for the girls would include Sheila in the discussions. I kind of guffawed, thinking now Sandy and Nora decide when Sheila gets a trip to the bathroom.

Back on topic, QOM's leadership felt some formal domme training would smooth out the girl's rough edges. So both girls started taking Apprentice Domme courses right when Sheila was demoted. With Sarah promoted to Alpha Slave, Zero was the personal slave they brought along when they were required to bring their own.

Dave and the Perseverance ladies said the courses helped both girls grow into mature, polished leadership, first of Sheila and Sarah, then of Layla when she joined the slave ranks on the Perseverance set. They also had the firm hands of former pro dominatrix Constance Anderson and legendary porn star Lara Gupta to guide them back on the right path when they got off it. It didn't hurt Sheila and Layla were Lara and Constance's sweeties, respectively.

What did this have to do with Amelia? Jasmine had noted Ann's control of the slaves was a little shaky. They obeyed her, but it lacked sharpness and precision.

Just Amelia entering the room made the slaves stand straighter and work faster. It was kind of funny how they tried to track where she was whenever she was in the room without obviously looking. Without a word, Amelia in a room with these two, you knew who ran the two gaffled up slavegirls just by their reactions. It reminded me a lot of how they were with Nora, you could tell the slaves had a highly attuned sense of her power over them.

And when Amelia spoke they straightened up quickly and moved faster, nervous eyes hoping not to incur their young English Domme's wrath. Maybe even get the smallest crumb of praise for their hardest efforts. If Mistress felt like it, of course. Today, she obviously didn't, much to Jasmine's delight. The exotic young girl laughed at the two obviously tense subs scrambling to obey harsh commands laced with insults, in a posh British accent no less. Okay, maybe I giggled a little too at their cute butts hustling to obey their strict young Mistress.

Ji frowned at little, like he was evaluating what was happening, and how much of it was on the level. Jasmine noted the slaves hustled to obey Amelia faster then Ann, even though both girls were harsh and authoritative despite being a couple of tears shy of twenty. She understood Amelia is a Mistress, and Ann wa
is a slave, and they are more used to obeying Amelia. But she saw something more she couldn't put her finger on...

Ji and I exchange a look. Maybe the vapid little nitwit is brighter than she seems. I mention Mistress Ari's theory of the ""Invisible Leash"". A good domme could be in the same room with their sub, both in casual street clothes. Without a word, in seconds you could tell who was in charge by their body language and reactions. Amelia had an invisible collar and leash firmly locked around Zero and Border Bunny's necks, and all three knew it. Ann was still learning to establish that kind of control. She lacked some of Amelia's natural talent, but was trying really hard.

Jasmine looks to where the young flame haired girl is chewing out her charges. Their vet wrapped backs are to us, cute bare butts facing us. Their rigid postures told us they are raptly trying to process every word of their Mistress's instruction, they don't dare miss anything. Ann is off to the left of the scene actually taking notes on a tablet. Jasmine's eyes swing back with new understanding of what she is seeing.

Mary decides to expound. She is speaking to me, but I can tell she felt it is a teaching moment for Jasmine. ""She may seem harsh on them, but that's part of her job. But it's not just bossing them around. She's responsible for monitoring Sheila's mental condition and triggers, and making sure she gets to counseling. Even when she's not their Mistress of the Day, I have her listed as their Mentoress and Advisor, because she's established good connections with them. I think it's a natural talent she has with slaves, though I'll have to give her a few more to be certain.""

Jasmine looks disbelieving. ""Oh, there are plenty of times, like now, when they hate her. It's not her job to be their friend. The thing is both of them know this, they've been in the business long enough to realize it's her job to bust their adorable twats, sometimes. Sure, the Perseverance crew blurred the lines with friendships while they were in charge."" Now the blond Mistress sounds wistful, I know from what the Perseverance women told me that she was mostly on the outside looking in for that.

""But, they know that's not the norm. They know by our standards that Amelia can't be friends with a couple of bare asses like them if she wanted to be."" She pauses for breath. ""But Amelia knows being their Mentoress is more then just yelling at them. If she's going to mold them into perfect subs through her teaching, she has to make sure their needs as people, not just slaves are met. When you assume authority over someone, you assume responsibility for them as well. I don't think Amelia expected to be a Mommy at 18. But she's learning that that's part of being a domme in Queen Of Mean's outfit, even if your ""kids"" are two older girls.""


Just then Mistress Amelia spoke over the intercom, there is a mike box right on the unused podium. The two slaves are giving us a full frontal of breasts and pussies now, their eyes beneath peaking out of their vet wrapped heads are wide with apprehension and nervousness.

""These two worthless bare arses slags would like to apologize for their lousy service to you good people! Apologize, slaves!"" She holds the mike out in front of them on it's long flexible cord.

""Weef orry or ou lousy ervice, iswesses n asters!"" Ji and I trade looks, their service was exemplary as two half mummified bare butt girls could make it, at least with Amelia in the room.

""You fucking little twits! You call that an apology."" She slaps her flogger down on the hostess podium, making the slaves flinch visibly. ""Apologize again, slaves!"" Sheila looks frightened now, and Layla looks more nervous then I've ever seen her. Wide eyed and desperate they mmmpph ""Eee orry, iswess n aster! or ouo ousy ervice! eee Illy atologize!"" Both look like they are silently hoping their mentoress will find their apology barely acceptable.

She doesn't even deign to acknowledge it. ""Now apologize for betraying my mentorship. I had faith in you girls, said even though you were the lowest slaves on the compound, you were the best! Make me look like  a bloody ninny!"" They chorus in terror ""E're orry or etraying er entorship, ishwes eila!""
More desperate, quiet pleas are visible in their beautiful eyes.

The red head rolls her eyes, sighs, and waved a contemptuous hand at the two nervous slaves. a silent ""look what I have to work with"" gesture. She slams down the mike and goes behind the slaves' backs to whisper in Ann's ear. The slaves try to keep their eyes from instinctively moving to track their authoritative Mistress. As Amelia whispers, Ann starts to get a real nasty smile.

Ann goes into the kitchen and comes back with two sets of leg shackles. She roughly kicks at Sheila's feet so she spreads them wider, crouches down and shackles her legs together with just enough chain for an awkward shuffle.
When she's done with Sheila she does the same to Layla. Both women flick their eyes to the poised red head domme, silently pleading ""Please don't do this to us, Mistress!""

""Keep your bloody eyes off uf me, you scumbags! it's less then what you deserve!"" two sets of exotic browns flick forward, now clearly trying not to let any panic show, though you can see it knawing at them.

Ann suprisingly gently cuts the vet wrap at the slaves mouths away and removes the packing. I recall QOM is a stickler for safety, no matter how rough their scenarios get. She open mouthed gags both slaves with ridiculous red lips O-gags.

Amelia picks up the hostess podium mike again. ""The fact that their shackled ain't no excuse for slow service, their infraction books are on their serving trays, don't hesitate to use them."" She holds up a short and stout plastic container in her right hand, next to it a more slender one. ""If you wanna tip'em, we got two ways to do it."" She taps the fat cylinder ""Put the money in here and plug it in their mouths, it's designed to hold but be taken out easily.""

She taps the taller cylinder. ""You can poke this one up their adorable little bums. Don't put anything in their smelly snatches, it's an infection concern, we don wanna deal with that. If you're concerned about giving these little slackers a reward for their loafing, don't worry, the tips go to the dedicated Betas who actually work around here.""

I noticed the lounge is packed, a few guests look like visitors, but it seems to be mostly QOM's people. I remember QOM were contracted to play the Amazonians on the Perseverance set. Sheila angered a lot of them personally with her ""Boss Bitch"" abrasive ways. They liked Layla at first when she replaced Sheila, but she earned some ire for using her newfound authority to protect her friend and former superior. I'm sure most of them marked their calendars for this day, to see the former Perseverance Leading ladies humbled as serving slaves under a teenager's lash.

A lusty cheer went up at Mistress Amelia's words. Zero and Border Bunny look like two women trapped in a nightmare. Which to an extent, they really are.
Speaking of lashes, Amelia apparently traded her flogger for a nasty long hybrid whip. She yells ""Move it, you bare arses!"" Sheila and Layla scramble wide eyed to dommes tables, nearly tripping over each other in their haste to obey their young Mistress. Amelia cracks the whip inches behind their scrambling butts. ""I said move, you twits!"" The Dommes cheer and start whistling at the slaves for service, wolves eager to fall upon the helpless deer driven into their midst.

Suprisingly, Amelia turns to Ann with a jocular manner, clapping her on the arm. I can't hear what their saying, but it seems like she's giving the Alpha slave a pep talk and some pointers, even clapping her shoulder in a friendly fashion. Her harsh manner with her Betas is gone, I'm starting to see the natural mentoring talent this English girl has.

Mary raises her voice and calls ""Mistress Amelia!"" The red head turns to regard her Senior Domme. ""Would you come here a moment?"" As the girl moves to obey, Mary looks at me. ""Want to talk to Amelia yourself, and learn how she manages the slaves training and education, cares for their needs, and keeps them firmly trapped under her thumb in chaotic venues like this?"" Would I ever! The slip of a girl who collared two of the formerly fastest rising women in the fetish industry, and is training them as slaves? Great copy! I nod eagerly.

I watch her approach. A short, but buxom and strong looking young girl, her ample bosom pushing against the black catsuit, seeming to want to spill out. Her hair tied up in a harsh school marm's bun, and her black full body catsuit and peaked black cap scream power and control. It contrasts with the bright, friendly smile she flashes at our table as she approaches. Apparently her demeanor with a superior and percieved peers is totally different then with slaves.

""What can I do for you good folk? Them little slave bitches giving you any trouble?"" I detect a faint eagerness for at least one of us to say yes. Jasmine, who's been giggling at the shackled slaves stumbling around and getting yelled at, turns and looks ready to grant the English girl's wish. A sharp look from Ji, combined with a severe frown, makes her reconsider.

Mary replies ""No dear, we're all fine with your girls. Miss Sux here just wants to know more about how you train and educate the slaves, I told her you're not just their Mistress of the day for today, but their Mentoress and Advisor when they train as slaves here.""

Jasmine moves aside and pats the seat next to hers. ""Mistress Amelia, please sit down! I like how you put those two in their place! You're an amazing domme!""
Amelia sits down and shrugs modestly.

""Dunno about amazing. Still learning the ropes, no pun intended. Got Mary, Stacy and other dommes mentoring and advising me. Don't get the wrong idea about my girls, you might think I hate them from watching us just now, but nothing is further from the truth. They're right good girls most of the time, glad I got them for my first slaves. Few bad habits to break, but they already know a lot about the job, and are natural submissives, I'll miss em when the day comes I can't be their Mistress anymore. Got to make'em respect me in a public venue like this, can't give an inch, especially with our age and experience differences. I talk to em in private when I can, they don't like it, but they understand.""

Jasmine's flabbergasted look must mirror my own. Ji is looking at Amelia thoughtfully. Mary's face is unreadable. I swear I hear affection and pride whenever she said ""my girls"".  ""Mistress Amelia, I understand you have to make them respect your authority, and the disparities between your ages, and their experience in the industry and yours, make that more challenging. But I saw them doing the best job they could, before you dressed them down. Did you have to be so arbitrarily cruel to them in front of so many people if you sincerely feel their ""good girls"".

""Just call me Amelia, or Am, Mistress is for the girls. Yes, I do gotta be that cruel to'em sometimes in public, to keep em in line.  By nature their very naturally submissive and well behaved. But that's a former Marine and the Former Loser Girl I'm in charge of. I saw her old Loser Girl stuff, that poor thing got fucked and beat to shit, looks like she had no real limits or safeties. Then to come back as a leader in an industry that treated her like that?""

""What do you think the reaction of two hardened girls would be to little eighteen year old me saying""Pretty please, loves, lick Mistress's boots, but only if you feel like it?"" They'd laugh and hoot me out of the compound, and word would get around I'm not domme material. So I got get hard on their little butts so they ain't even tempted to smirk at the ""British Girl"". I enjoy it sometimes, but I know the poor little things got it rough today. I feel a little bad for'em, but I can give the cuties little slack for an event like this. They know it as well as I do, if they think I go too far, sometimes. I always make it up to'em on the backend.""

I marvel at the maturity and insight of this woman barely out of girlhood. Nora's potential was marred by her crappy childhood until recently, but this girl clearly shines as having a bright future as a leader in the fetish industry.

Cutting her teeth on two former stars wasn't hurting either. ""How exactly do you get em on the back end, Miss-Amelia?"" Jasmine giggles again. ""With her strap on!"" When no one else laughs, she gets the hint and goes sullenly quiet. ""Not quite, Mistress Jasmine."" She says, unruffled. ""For today, I'll give em in easy day tomorrow."" At Mary's sharp look she adds ""Not too easy, Mistress Mary. After they've done their wake up, coffee and grooming duties for you, gonna unfetter them and give'em aftercare. Let Sheila make that French Roast you sent in the last package for her and Layla."" She nods at Ji and Jasmine. ""Make'em work on their Mistress reports on me for two hours, unfettered with no one bothering em.""

At my quizzical look, Mary explains. ""Guest slaves who stay at the compound for two weeks or more  have to write a report evaluating their mentoring and advising Mistress. They're expected to be completely honest with no threat of punishment. No groveling odes or obscenity laden screeds are accepted. Just a thoughtful, honest evaluation of how well their mentoress did by them. We make allowances for educational and intelligence differences in slaves. In Sheila's and Layla's case, they're both so intelligent and well read we expect a 5 page MLA format paper. We're certain they're smart enough not to be jerks, as a childish, obscene rant could jeopardize the business relationship between QOM and Perseverance Studios.""
Personally, I look forward to reading both their papers.""

Amelia grins ruefully. ""Obviously, so do I, especially after today."" Once again her humility shines through. She knew a well written evaluation of her by her first two slaves, especially industry titans like Sheila and Layla, could make or break her future here. Her awareness of this makes me feel her cruelty is performative with clear objectives, not gratuitous. The care underneath the cruelty seems more real to me with that grin.

""At any rate, I'll just have them write on tablets in their room."" She nods to Ji. ""We let'em be roommates, just like you lot asked. Some other dommes wanted to split'em up, but I said no, they're obviously good for each others peace of mind, as much stress as I was going to lay on em, they needed it."" She smiled gratefully at Mary. ""Mistress Mary backed me up, or I might have lost that fight.""

""Anyhow, make'em do their assigned reading from 12 to 2. Story Of O for Layla, to maybe help stir up her latent submissive side. Like I said, I think she's a natural, just suppresed it most of her life. Trauma and Addiction for Sheila, to maybe give her more insight into her self destructive habits. No point in assigning her erotic reading, she's imaginative enough in that area. Me and the girl chums used to slip past parental controls and watch the Perseverance when we was kids. I guess I'm kind of a fan. I hope someday when there's no longer a chance of me being her Mistress, I can tell her it was kind of an honor to have her and ""Staff Sergeant Perez"" as me first slaveys.""

I was truly awed. She put legs on Mary's claim QOM mentored and educated slaves, not just toyed with them. She might have help from Mary or older dommes, but it was still impressive she could tailor a reading plan for an individual slave's personality, and give them time to finish their assigned writing. While starting college in a foreign country and meeting all the other requirements QOM has for Junior Dommes.

Add to that she didn't just know they were giants in the fetish industry, but seemed to be personal heros as well. Yet she balanced strict, sometimes harsh discipline with tender care for ""her girl's"" needs, physical, emotional and psychological.

Jasmine was quiet, probably thinking about all the things involved in being a domme Mistress Katie didn't teach her. Mary looks quietly proud. Mr. Ji for the first time since we got here has a look of approval on his face, directed at this suprisingly wiser than her years young girl.

As an objective reporter, I shouldn't do this. But, screw it. I reach across the table to gently touch her hand. ""Am, I've gotten to know Sheila and Layla a little personally covering the Perseverance. Both those girls have been to hell and back, and done way worse things to other girls than you have to them, out of self defense and necessity."" (I flashback on Mistress Emily being led off into slavery to Ari after the Perseverance's crew suprise victory over her team). ""Even if they hate you now, they understand what you have to do. They'll write you a good report and forgive you. I hope one day I can cover the three of you laughing together as friends and equals.""

For one moment she looked like a hopeful, starstruck eighteen year old girl, instead of a 60 year old domme inhabiting a very young body. ""You really think so? That'd be smashing!"" A tear shimmered in the corner of her right eye. ""I think so."" I said with as much sincerity as I could muster.

Then there was a buzz inside Ji's suitcase. He looks puzzled, but popped it open and took out his tablet unlocking it and looking suprised. I guess he put it on speaker because I hear Nora's voice bark: ""Lieutenant Commander Kang, report!"" I knew Nora was shooting scenes for the next episode, so I presume she is in uniform as Commander Gail.

Kang gets a bemused smile and decides to play along. ""Ma'am, the away team is proceeding normally, Ensign Abdullah and myself have encountered no problems. The captives are well behaved and well cared for."" Jasmine is not impressed by the role playing, rolling her eyes and saying ""Geeks"".

""Oh, is that so, because I got the report the captives were misbehaving and dishonoring our name."" All eyes fell on Amelia, who looks a little flustered. ""It wasn't me, I swear."" Then Ji looks sideyed at a smirking Jasmine, her arms folded with satisfaction. ""Would this report have come...from Ensign Abdullah?""
Nora or ""Commander Gail"" affirms it did.


""Commander...I'm afraid there's been a miscommunication. The lovely Mistress Amelia affirmed for us that a recent display of discipline was performative and not punitive, to keep the captives obedient and docile. They have been performing and behaving quite well considering their circumstances."" Jasmine glared at him like ""You broke my favorite toy, you bastard!""

I hear Nora say ""Okay, I see. Is my limey girl Am there?"" Nora and Amelia had bonded over her being the star of one of Amelia's favorite shows, and now both of them having charge of two fetish industry legends.

Ji frowns but hands the tablet to Amelia. ""Nora, you bloody little Yankee Ragamuffin, how are you!"" Nora replied with British slang, to Amelia's delight. ""Smashing, how are my little cutie pies?""

Amelia lights up when she talks about her older slavegirls. ""They're great! Not only are they bloody adorable, but they're so smart and submissive, I got to make up reasons to discipline them, they're so good! You and the Perseverance crew are lucky to have such beautiful, obedient slaves. I'd trade any four of our lot for the two of them, any day!"" Her real feelings for the slaves after her cruel public shaming is kind of touching.

Nora is quiet. ""Yes, they are lovely women. On the inside as well as the outside. Smart, brave, loyal. I'm glad you're taking good care of them Am."" There was a deepheartfelt silence, the two young women bonding over their feelings for ""Zero"" and ""Border Bunny"".

When I heard Nora's voice again, it is full of mischief. ""I hear you been pranking on my slaves, raking them over the coals for imaginary failings."" Amelia's grin echoed the mischief in Nora's voice. 

""They're a couple of smart, tough slags, as we been discussing, I don't keep em off balance and nervous, even the best behaved slaves can get funny ideas about rebelling. Plus, it's so cute to watch them put extra hustle in their bare arses when I enter the room.""

Nora sounds wistful ""I know that feeling, those two's submission is like an addictive drug, the more you get of it, the more you want to keep extending their time as slaves to get high being their Mistress.""
her voice brightens. ""Want to extend the fun a little while keeping them submissive and off balance? I could convene a Captain's Mast, give them a summary sentence for malingering on your watch, Am.""
Jasmine pumps her fist in victory. ""Yes, we'll make an ""it"" girl out of you yet, Nora!"" Ji cuts in ""Miss Jameson, young lady, I have the highest respect for your authority and accomplishments. But I'm using the ""Adult in the Room"" card given to me by Mr. Henson, Constance, and Lara. I forbid you to keep tormenting those poor women unnecessarily. They've sacrificed so much, for so many. There is no point in taunting them with childish, cruel pranks.""

Nora is quiet a moment. Then she says. ""Mr. Ji, you need to look at some tits and loosen up, Jasmine, are you with me, girl?"" Jasmine's hands come to the zipper of her Khaki shirt, while she smiles seductively at Ji. ""I seen you looking at me and all the other girls, big boy. At first I thought you were gay or took some weird vow of celibacy. Now I think you're just better at keeping your dick in your pants then most guys. But you're  still a guy."" 

""Amelia, you want to help out?"" Amelia looks at Ji kind of doe eyed now. ""Show my tits to a handsome bloke, so I can have some more fun with two pretty slaves, I'm game."" She turns the tablet to face Ji, Nora has her hands up to her uniform blouse, ready to start undoing buttons. She's giving Ji a steamy look that doesn't seem fake.

""You girls should have seen the time he had to carry me naked for a scene in the show, he had a hard on ready to bust out of his trousers. He dumped a bucket of ice down them after shooting while we all laughed at him."" Nora finishes her story with a chuckle, and the other two young Mistresses join her.

Ji reddens, then starts to look angry. His patience is amazing, but something in the young women's sexualized taunts is wearing it thin. I carefully put a hand on his arm and say ""Ji."" He looks at me mad at first, but when he sees I am in his corner he starts  taking deep, calming breaths.

""Girls!"" Mary barks  ""Stop teasing Mr. Ji. And start acting like dommes, instead of drunk, slutty teases at the local honky tonk on a Friday night!"" Mary's rebuke causes all three women to drop their hands and look pensive, even though she technically only has authority over Amelia.

Then Mary's expressions softens as she reaches out to touch Ji's wrist. The look they exchange leave me no doubt how strong and far back their bond goes.

""Soo Hyun, just let them do a check in and maybe have a little fun with the slaves. Let the girls tease them a little, but we won't actually let them add any burdens. You know I don't care for either of those two much, but they have been putting in the effort, to their credit. These fine young tops can blow off some steam making them sweat a little, without adding any actual stressors.""

Ji nods. ""Alright."" He turns to Mistress Amelia, ""However you want to play it, young lady. I believe you're sincere and even precociously effective in looking out for their interests. But I will step in if I think you're going to far."" His eyes swing to Jasmine, then Nora on the laptop screen. All three young ladies solemnly nod. I remember being skeptical when the Perseverance ladies told me how authoritative this soft spoken man can be. Now I see first hand they wtelling tall stories.

Amelia pulls out a phone and starts texting. Mary replies to my quizzical look. ""Alpha Slaves like Ann are allowed to elect to carry their phones on them at the compound. The catch is their phone is inspectlableat all times by any domme. Betas like Layla and Sheila have to have their phones locked up with the rest of their personal property. Their phones are not inspectable by anyone, even QOM herself or Stacy. Amelia can inspect their phones if she gives them personal time on 
them, immediately after times up. But as Betas they have the perogative to refuse the personal time if they don't want her looking at their phone. Their guest Betas, so we don't expect them to adhere to the same loyalty standards we have for our fulltime slaves Betas and Alphas."" I scribble furiously, another fascinating insight into QOM's often secretive organizational structure.

A moment later I see Ann walk to the podium and pick up the mike. ""Slaves Zero and Border Bunny are to present themselves at the guest table, immediately! Slave Taylor and Slave Schafer, cover their tables until they are released."" As Sheila and Layla nervously shuffle over to us, a blond and brunette in purple thong bikinis glare at their backs. Taylor and Schafer, presumably.

Poor girls, it's not their fault, but those glares portend bullying, later. Though after talking to Mistress Amelia, they'llq only get the opportunity if the stern but caring young domme isn't around.

As they shuffle towards to the table, Mary says quietly, but sternly, ""Domme faces, ladies, except for you of course, Bambi. That means, no giggling or smirking, Mistress Jasmine, keep your face grave, like the slaves worst offense is existing in your presence."" She seems to really pointedly aim the last sentence at the dark girl. 

Jasmine rolls her eyes ""I may not have taken any of your courses, like Nora and Amelia, but I know what a domme face is."" snottily. She does turn a convincing firm glare on the slaves, like there existence on earth is an egregious crime against decency.
Sheila shuffles up, Layla to her left, I can tell by how they move they have tip cylinders up their butts. Poor things have the fat canisters plugging their O-gagged lips, too.

They bow awkwardly, hindered by their half wrapped bodies, and trays strapped to their waists and chained clamped to their nipples. ""Eeetings, Iswess ary, iswess iela, iswesses n asters, ow ay ee erv uou?"" Greetings, Mistress Mary , Mistress Amelia, Mistresses and Master, how may we serve you?"" Their eyes flicked so fast a laymen would never catch it.

Three hard Mistress faces to their right didn't seem to phase them much, like they were expecting it. But a flick to Nora glaring out from the tablet brought a look of suprised terror. When their eyes flicked over me I tried to flash my most reassuring smile. Ji just nodded in silent support, face grim.  Then their eyes were aligned at perfect thousand yard stare for the Slave Attention position. As I said a novice never would have caught how fast they read the table.

""I know your dumb bare asses saw your Chief Disiplinarian, Nora, when you did what you thought was a slick eye flick around the table. Look at her and greet her properly you little nitwits!"" Amelia's jovial tone was replaced by her stern Domme authority voice.

This was a quandary, I could tell despite Mistress Jasmine's and Mistress Mary's authority, the powers that they were wary of were Nora and Amelia. I noted to do a compare and contrast piece on  these two natural young leaders if I got a chance. It was kind of funny how their eyes locked on Nora but kept flicking nervously to Amelia, as if they weren't sure which younger domme was going to explode on them at any second. ""Eeetings, ishwess ora! Ow ay ee erve uou!"" they intoned. Nervous eyes pleaded for their greeting to be acceptable.

Nora just glowers at them out of the screen from her desk, all good humor seemingly gone. It is a good act that seems to take in these two slaves who mentored her to this role. She silently makes them sweat for a long moment.

""Mistress Amelia, how has these two slave's performance been so far?"" The lithe young domme grinds out in menacing tones.

Amelia gives a put upon sigh. ""Barely acceptable, I guess, barely."" Another long suffering sigh. ""I'm working on'em, Mistress Nora."" Nora glares more intensely from the screen, the slaves trying not to squirm. ""Barely acceptable-barely acceptable! Are you telling me the two women who demanded perfection from us on a daily basis-not just as subs, but leaders, are BARELY ACCEPTABLE bottom slaves!"" She looks like she wants to jump through the screen and punish the terrified slaves, who looks like they want to disappear.

Amelia's note is slightly softer, if still stern. ""Not all their fault Mistress Nora, got some bad habits to unlearn from being in charge, they know their role, they just ain't slipping into it with ease, sometimes. I'm workin with em, they're comin a long."" The slaves look a little suprised, I'm guessing that's high praise from Mistress Amelia in their hearing, at least in public.

Another moment of silence from Nora. Then ""Relax, you two, breathe. I don't want either of you to have a stroke or a heart attack, okay. You're not doing that bad, just keep following Miss Amelia's lead, she's showing talent molding you both. And I know you're good clay. There's no trouble waiting for you when you get back. We'll all have an equals meeting over a catered lunch in the Ready Room. We can debrief then. Okay?""

Two obedient ""Yeph, Iswess Ora!"" from the slaves. No smile, but she does kiss her  hand and touch the screen. ""Be good, girls, bye."" The screen flicks off.

The slaves look relieved until Amelia stands up again, then they look like their battling terror. She walks up to them, gently nudges them apart, putting her left hand on Sheila's left shoulder, her right hand on Layla's right. ""Hang in there, my pretty little birds. Don't let it swell those lovely heads, but yer doing good. Still got a few long hours ahead, stay sharp. We'll talk tomorrow if we ain't get a chance tonight, I set a light day for ya.""

I saw genuine appreciation and admiration as they took in her little pep talk. They may hate and resent her stern side sometimes, but they saw she came from a place of nurturing and care, even if it was sometimes tough love. Feeling the bond of mutual respect between the strict young domme and her more experienced subs, I knew they were going to give her a glowing evaluation.

Then she leaned in and whispered something low and sensual in Sheila's ear. I was pretty sure it was sensual, because I saw Sheila's nipple's harden despite the clamps. She did the same to Layla, which made Jasmine chuckle. ""Anyone tell you girls it's not polite to point?""

The two slaves were caught in the erotic web weaved by their Mistress, no doubt pressing the ""naturally submissive"" tendencies she'd noticed in each woman.  She smiled back at us reveling in our witness to another layer of control she had over tge two women.

Then she roughly shoved their shoulders until they are spun 180 facing away from us. In her stage voice she yelled ""Breaks over you little slackers, get your bloody naked bums back to work. Report to Alpha Ann, then turn over your tips to Taylor and Schafer. Move!""  Both hands slapped a nude cutie pie'sass cheek to get them hustling back out into the lounge.

She sat down and called Ann, putting it on speaker for us. ""Hey, Ann, my two lack wits are coming to report to you. Have'em stand by until you can get coverage on Taylor and Schafer's tables. Then get them some gloves to retrieve their tips, for the rest of the day. Zero's and Border Bunny's tips go to Taylor and Schafer.""

Two things, if you can work Taylor and Schafer into your command of them do it. Let'em have a little fun with the bare bums, but remember I'm watching, bully'em to much and all three of you are going to be gaffled up like them working  here tomorrow. Also make sure you count out and record the tips before those two thonged wenches claim'em. Doing good so far Ann, gonna recommend your Mistress start signing off your domme qual sheet. Thank you, bye.""

Amelia looked at me, guessing my question about recording tips. ""Taylor and Schafer will pocket the cash,  but my girls will gets what's coming to them, that's why I'm having Ann count it. They earned those tips, and they're bloody getting them if I have to pay out of me own pocket."" I was impressed at how much Amelia generally cared about the two women under her charge, beneath her harsh exterior.

I was about to ask more questions about her relationship with the slaves during off hours when Mary asked ""So what else do you want to cover, Bambi?"" I have a lot, hopefully I could catch up with Amelia later. Or even talk to the slaves during their visitation meeting.

But then my REACTIONARY movement, which fully supports basically everything I have (image), and somehow also has marginal interest group pressure on my Landowners (not by the aristocrats mind, but through the 22.5K FARMERS who are for some reason Landowners) pushes to Insurrectionary, primarily because of Turmoil due to low SoL,  and starts a Civil War.

Because Landowners are somehow ""pressured"" they fall out of government when the war starts.  I crush the revolution and they DROP to 0% clout and have 9 years of sore loser clout reduction.

And making this even more difficult for Brazil, Brazil's national politics at the time were VERY VERY VERY state-driven.

This is going to get downvoted but I don't care I just need to vent. 

I'm a final year and unfortunately applying for jobs hasn't gone as planned. I only wanted prestigious MBB consulting and was extremely bitter for not getting an elite internship in my second year. 

I was unsuccessful again when recruiting for MBB in final year and have unfortunately had to reluctantly accept an offer for a low prestige industry role. The pay is decent in a low cost of living region and the money goes a lot further than a high salary in London. 

The company has a few ex-consultants, but in my eyes these are just the guys who couldn't hack it at MBB and washed out into an inferior job. 

My prospective firm has been very welcoming and everyone there has said they're really looking forward to me joining, but I'm literally only joining them because I couldn't get the MBB offer I wanted unfortunately. 

They've invited me to a dinner with the wider team which I declined and made up an excuse for because I was just so disappointed over how my career has gone and that I've ruined everything and have wasted all of this effort over the past few years to still not get into MBB. 

They have some industry award nights which are black tie events for various firms across the industry to celebrate various high performing employees, and they've invited me because I still haven't met the wider team despite having been invited for coffee on various occasions. 

They will be taking pictures at this event and I just don't want to attend and have my picture taken because they post on LinkedIn (as they have done every year) and I don't want people I know finding out how far I've fallen off compared to the goals I've had to end up in a mediocre position. 

I know this sounds stupid but I've been getting deranged with regret and resentment especially over the past few months and need some clarity on what to do. 

It would be weird if I said ""please don't post any pictures of me"" but if I cancel again they will assume I'm just not interested since I feel one of them is getting that vibe already because they've become less enthusiastic with me. ",0,1745296493.0,UniUK,47,0.18,False

Anyway, I have a coupon from Stanley so I'm considering buying more than one, then return the ones I don't want. 

I'm still stuck choosing between the colors & the 16oz and 20 oz. On the one hand, I might not drink much coffee on certain days, but with a 20 oz I have the option to drink as much or as little as I want. Plus I can use it for other things besides coffee. I'm just worried that the 20oz might look bigger in person vs the 16oz. What are your experiences with 20 oz coffee mugs?🤔


Also, Why isn't there more hype on this mug? They look so nice. If anyone has purchased the mug, can you share a pic and post under this? What size did you get and does it work well for your needs?

1k4xtnh,https://www.reddit.com/r/economicCollapse/comments/1k4xtnh/surviving_economic_collapse/,Surviving economic collapse,"Howdy!

As a farmer (I work in medicine when I’m not running the farms) I’d like to create a post for yall. If things really go as bad as they may, I’d like to create a reference post for folks. The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is today. If you have information that can help folks in a collapse please post it here. (And I don’t mean stupid as sin shit like buy crypto or gold. If I’m down to my last 5 loaves of bread I don’t care about some metal I can’t eat or some jumble of binary. That doesn’t mean anything. But I would trade for some honey or berry jam or milk. )

My grandparents on both sides survived the Great Depression because they grew their own foods, canned, and made their own goods. Another reason for their survival and thriving was they built a community of folks that helped each other and did what was needed. My great great grandma and her sister in law (who was black, which even in Bakersfield back then made us Irish outcasts having crossed relations) helped feed the hobos every week. (Hobos is shorthand Central California slang for Hoe Boys. Around weed patch there actually developed the rarest American accent, a mix of Irish, okie, and southern. But odd history aside) When things got really bad, my great grand daddy was an educated man, an engineer. As such he has money from working the Long Beach and lost hills oil wells. He bought his neighbors farms back from the bank and leased them to his neighbors as cost. They all paid him back by the time his son, my grandfather left to fight in Europe. I still have family friends up that way who the older generation remember all that. We may have to do this again.  We may have to grow our own food, we may have to cook it and share it, we may have to make bathtub gin, and make our own soap. But today we live in the Information Age. Hopefully we can make it easier on ourselves and families because of this. And since this is the economic collapse group, yall think it’s gonna happen as do I. Why don’t we create a one stop place to cross reference everything we may need? Anything real good that comes up in the comments (if the admin allow this post that is) I will migrate to the bottom of this post. Hopefully we can create a massive information dump that folks can cross reference and help each other with. 

With the permission of the administration of this post, if they say it’s ok I will throw in a shameless plug for my farm, as I honestly believe my products will help yall and are honestly and fairly priced. I won’t do it unless I get approved though. Otherwise use this as a post for folks to talk and communicate on how to survive a severe economic downturn. It ain’t if. It’s just when. Hopefully we are all prepared. 

1st yall need to look up your local USDA extension service. These kind folks haven’t been cut yet from the government. Make them as busy as hell to justify them folks! Ask what crops you can grow on your little bit of backyard land to help your family. You can grow a coffee replacement, tea replacement, and your herbs all on a windowsill in downtown NUC. So don’t make an excuse. Start offsetting your costs now. Remember the rule of eating. Potatoes, grains, beans, and corn (grasses) keep your calories up. That’s what you need to grow for survival. Make sure to plant enough to survive. Most families can produce enough to live off of excluding meat and dairy on 1/4 acre of land. Look up the book the backyard homestead. It’s not the best on the subject but the best is no longer in print. So it’s the best book you can get cheap and readily. With meat, dairy, and fiber production that increases to 1/2 to 1 acre, however that can be done very well and increase trade able goods. If you take the pasture land and plant it interspersed with nut trees, as well as rotating the animals, crops, and cover crops, you get a double win) At that point you can survive almost indefinitely without much off of the farm. But even having a little backyard food supply can greatly offset food costs and help. Potato boxes when properly done can produce over 100lbs each. For a family of 4 you’d need 10 to survive every year. Get started. Even you city folks can do half of that on a balcony. And if your HOA complains, well times are getting bad enough most folks won’t have the compunction to be upset when you gotta do what you gotta do with them damn folk. Yall know what I’m saying. Eat the Karen’s. 

2nd get to know your neighbors and kinfolk. I have some really great Hispanic neighbors just north of my farm. We trade all the time. I can’t make tamales or tortillas to save my life, but I grew 10 acres of corn, 1/4 mile biological fence of nopales, and my dairy goats cut our fire breaks for the farms every year. We trade a lot and often. They milk my goats daily, make the cheese, and give me half back to trade with, eat, or sell. In exchange they do a lot of the work, help on my farm, etc. I work in medicine. I’ve helped out a lot of their folk and delivered 2 of their kids. I wish they would stop delivering at home, especially when I’ve drank too much gosh darn it. The smell of blood and mucus still gives me the twinges when I drank too much bathtub hootch. But find what you can do and find what others can do. We have to find people we can count on. This internet age has gotten us to forget this. Make friends with your neighbors. Do good things. Volunteer. With a strong community you can survive. On your own you can’t. Civilization was created so we can build together. Without each other humans ain’t the top dog in the world. We will just tear each other apart. And even if you’re not religious, it doesn’t hurt to spend time around those folks and have an additional group of people to tap into. I’m an Atheist but both the catholic priest and local preacher in my little town have my number. They know I won’t listen to any wild ass sermons, but they know if any folks need help I’ll show up and do what I can. As such when I need anything, half the damn town shows up. 

3rd learn the cheap ways to survive. Flour still comes in cloth sacks. You know why they have pretty patterns? In the Great Depression the flower mills (which were owned by farmers. They were mainly farm union mills that did this) found out the okies were suffering so damn bad they would make clothes from the flower sacks. As such they’d put their company names in washable ink and patterns on in indelible ink. That way little girls could have their mamas make them nice dresses. I still have one my grandma kept from her childhood that she wore. At 6 years old in the summer in Bakersfield she picked cotton for 1 penny per lb. Picking cotton ain’t fun let me tell you. But the American farmer has always watched out for his fellow Americans. I ain’t gonna let my forebears down. That bulk flower makes cheap bread that will keep you alive too. Buying flower and making bread is less than 10 cents a loaf every today. The cheapest at the store is $1.5. You can make 15 loafs for the same price. I’m already proud of you folk. You’re gonna be alright. Buckle down. Learn one thing every day. Small steps. Just start early. If everything stays ok, you’ll have a laugh, learn something, and make some friends. If it goes to shit you’ll thank me. 

Storeys books, which was founded with the hippie back to the earth movement, still produces some great material. Their older stuff is way better (for example, their old beef cattle books telling you how to treat bloat versus the new ones telling you to call the vet. If you’re farming you need to pony up and be a farmer) but I do recommend to everyone the backyard homestead as a starting place. It goes over everything you need to feed a family of 4 of 1/4 acre. Yea. The modern version grinds my gut a little with some of its hooey. But! It’s a darn good start for yall. I admit madigan and mcclouds books are a useful starting point. Check them out double quick before your credit cards are canceled and you can’t afford to get started. 


On a personal note, my mama was a meth addict. I grew up homeless and had to make my own way in life. I had my first job on a strawberry farm when I was 13 years old. It wasn’t a pleasure farm. That was an honest to god working farm. I still don’t have full feeling in my fingertips. But I made it. I taught myself how to survive. I read every book I could. Talked to everyone who was willing to teach. I built myself up. I’m 33 now. I have two farms in the USA, a ranch, a farm just south of Kyoto where my wife and daughter live (hopefully some more here soon) and in Limerick(dairy). I got myself an advanced practice nursing degree and two MBAs. I work 7 days a week and do my best to still help folks including my own. My specialty in medicine is pediatric hospice. I take care of dying kids for a living. I’ve been with over 2500 children who have left this earth in my career. 

Now why the personal introduction? I’m a tough bastard. I’ve lived through hard times. Most of yall don’t know how hard and nasty things can get. If they hit anything close to the doomsday yall are talking about here, it will be like the Great Depression. Get yourself a book or two and learn about it. I recommend the grapes of wraith by Steinbeck and Let us now praise Famous Men by Agee and Evans. I’m worried about yall. Americans alive today have no idea what hardship is and what this could truly look like. If you have the slightest worry please listen close. Build a community. Learn skills. Find cheap ways to live, to eat, to enjoy life. Imagine when you can’t afford internet or your smartphone anymore. How are you going to communicate, build relationships, and survive and thrive? Do you go to church? (I’m an atheist. It’s a community question not moralistic) do you have 20 people you can reach out to to help you and to help them? And really help. Not a few text messages of support. Going and bleeding helping them tear up and plow a few acres so yall can eat and not starve. 

If America faces a Great Depression like before, we are in deep trouble. In the 30s, 90% of folks lived on farms. Today less than 10% do. Buy some land with some friends together and get started now. 10 folks can afford 2-3 acres within an hour of any US city today. You need 30% down. Even in LA/SD, there is farm land for under $20,000 USD (raw) per acre. But, folks even radish take 30 days to grow. If we are all wrong, you made 10 close friends, lost weight, and built a damn farm that has real value. If we are right, and I hope we aren’t, then you can survive and thrive helping yourself and others. Do you really think our government will provide food to the people if everything collapsed? I have a hard time believing it. One of my skills is medicine. I’m an expert at it.  Also know where modern medicine comes from. Digoxin, a cardiac glycoside for arrhythmia comes from foxglove. Alendronate used for increasing bone density originated from oyster mushrooms prior to them changing the medicine enough to be patented. Aspirin from willow. Etc etc. I know how to grow and make medicine from natural sources. Everyone should have bread poppy seeds at the very least. And yes. I mean that for what you think it’s used for. How are you gonna pull a tooth at home without an anesthetic,

There are many easy to learn skills that will help you and your family. You’re not helpless. Don’t act like it. Everyone here can find 10 folks to get together and buy some rural land owner carry. Trust me. There’s tons. I’ve done it several times. My current for fun project is a mini Bethlehem in the Southern California desert. I got the acres for $2000. All the improvements cost another $1000 and sweat equity. I now have my permaculture farm in California city, barren as hell, but producing food. I put in ancient style dwellings with modern earthquake prevention (no electricity or plumbing though. This was a fun project to have a place to go vacation off grid for a week at a time, not get tweeter or tick tak notifications.) Ain’t enough really for a family by itself but I put it in just to prove I could do it in a place that’s basically a mix between hell and the face of the sun. My actual producing farm in San Diego can produce on 10 acres enough to feed well over 200 folks. 

Hope this post is acceptable in the thread and I hope we are all wrong. If we aren’t…. Well shit. I hope yall listened a bit to an old crusty harass farmer. 

And even if the worst happens we can all pull through. Tighten that belt. There’s a hell of a lot of good folks out there who want to help and be helped. I’m one of them. It’s gonna be ok. We can play some cards after we get your potatoes planted.

1k4xtma,https://www.reddit.com/r/latterdaysaints/comments/1k4xtma/gay_sibling/,Gay Sibling,"Posting this on a throwaway account. My brother came out as gay recently to my family.

I’ve been going through a bit of a faith crisis over the last two years and felt like I was in a good, stable spot prior to him coming out. However, this has produced doubts that are much more personal. 

A scenario popped into my head recently, and I don’t know how to run around it or justify it. I could really use some help/advice for anyone who has been through something similar. 

I pictured myself being asked this simple question: “if your brother marries a man and lives his whole life married to that man, do you believe he will be part of your eternal family in the celestial kingdom?”

Here’s my problem -

If the answer is yes: What’s the point of all this? Why are we even on this earth? Does this say that everyone else around me is going to make it, too, and if so, what is the point of these covenants, and not drinking coffee, etc. etc. if we’re all going to end up in the same place?

If the answer is no: What kind of a God do I believe in? How can heaven be happy without a brother that I love and care about so much? Am I supposed to feel content with going down and visiting him periodically in a lower kingdom?

Have any of you harbored these same feelings? And how did you learn to live with the feelings in good conscience while being an active member of the church? ",1,1745296256.0,latterdaysaints,4,0.55,False

I'm at a T15 and unfortunately recruiting hasn't gone as planned. I only wanted MBB and was extremely bitter after my undergrad for failing to get into MBB and having to settle for less prestigious jobs. 

I was unsuccessful again when recruiting for MBB and have unfortunately had to reluctantly accept an offer for an industry role. The pay is decent in a low cost of living region and the money goes a lot further than a high salary in a high cost of living area. 

The company has a few ex-consultants, but in my eyes these are just the guys who couldn't hack it at MBB and washed out into an inferior job. 

My prospective firm has been very welcoming and everyone there has said they're really looking forward to me joining, but I'm literally only joining them because I couldn't get the MBB offer I wanted unfortunately. 

They've invited me to a dinner with the wider team which I declined and made up an excuse for because I was just so disappointed over how my career has gone and that I've ruined everything and have wasted all of this effort over the past fucking decade to still not get into MBB. 

They have some industry award nights which are black tie events for various firms across the industry to celebrate various high performing employees, and they've invited me because I still haven't met the wider team despite having been invited for coffee on various occasions. 

They will be taking pictures at this event and I just don't want to attend and have my picture taken because they post on LinkedIn (as they have done every year) and I don't want people I know finding out how far I've fallen off compared to the goals I've had to end up in a mediocre position. 

I know this sounds stupid but I've been getting deranged with regret and resentment especially over the past few months and need some clarity on what to do. 

It would be weird if I said ""please don't post any pictures of me"" but if I cancel again they will assume I'm just not interested since I feel one of them is getting that vibe already because they've become less enthusiastic with me. ",0,1745296088.0,MBA,24,0.29,False

Any ideas that I take would be credited and appreciated.,"I am writing a story for my next short film. The Logline is - A cynical woman's boring grocery run takes a surreal turn when a new coffee powder actually delivers on its promise to ""cease time"" with one mind-blowing sip. 

The duration of the film can be a Minimum of 1 minute and maximum of 5 mins. I developed more than half of the film where she realizes the coffee ceases the time indeed by showing the clock stops ticking and the water drop lets stops in the mid air. But what I lack is to find the purpose of the story. It ceases time, so what?! I do not know how to end this but I do think the first half can hook some people.

I sincerely need your help finishing up this movie. I will credit anyone who helps me or gives an idea. I will be releasing this on Youtube. 

That being said, this is 100% indie film with a lot of restrictions. It has to be either fully or atleast 90% indoor. I have an apartment I am looking to shoot it there. And my girl friend would be starring in the movie. That means only 1 person will be acting and if the story demands 1 male character, which is me, also willing to act for a couple of scenes. Because if I act, then there are no people to shoot this. So I will have to shoot it with the help of tripod if both of us have to be in front of the camera. Next condition is, i would prefer if this is conversationless. No conversation needed. If the story demands, we can include 1 or 2 phone calls. 

I ask for 1 min of your time. Just give it a thought and if you find anything interesting please leave a note here or DM.",3,1745296074.0,ReadMyScript,1,1.0,False
1k4xrbw,https://i.redd.it/49y102g5dbwe1.jpeg,New Setup - Ascaso and Eureka," Hey all!

I took delivery of my new Ascaso Dream PID and am really loving it so far.  The look is perfect for my kitchen and the wood details are classy.  I have been getting better than most cafe results with Lavazza and Cafe Bustelo pregound with the pressurized baskets (don’t shoot me!)  I also pulled some decent decaf shots using Illy pods with the pod specific basket.  I figure I may as well try out all the features while waiting for the grinder.  

Today I received my Libra 65 and I'm looking forward to fresh ground in the morning. 

The Libra 65 over the standard Libra has the larger burrs, a dosing cup, the nice round hopper and comes with a magnetic dosing funnel which makes grinding a no mess operation. BTW I first got a Specialita from Amazon. The hopper was cracked so it got returned. Then I decided the GBW might be helpful for the workflow hence the Libra. I spent a while and wasted some beans before getting a shot in a reasonable time / volume range but I’m pretty close now.  I have several shots from the test runs in the refrigerator for iced Americanos tomorrow. 

Accessories for the Dream are really nice - 7 baskets, most are labeled as competition.  Solid and attractive tamper included as well. 

I didn't go duo as I have limited space under cabinets and really dig the retro style of the Dream.  

For those curious I'm ready to pull shots in under 3 minutes from power up.  After pulling a shot I'm ready to steam in about 40 seconds.  

To bring the thermoblock back to brewing temperature is of course the main single boiler delay.  If I just leave the machine alone I can be pulling shots about 8 minutes after steaming.  If I'm rushing, letting the remaining steam out and flushing about 12 ounces of water through the steam wand allows me to pull shots again in under 2 minutes (I used this water to brew iced tea).  

I'm getting better at milk steaming and often use a few tablespoons of half and half in a small pitcher for breve cortados or macchiatos.  I'm finding the steam pretty powerful for small amounts of milk so I turned the steam temp down a touch which seems to help.  I'm looking forward to implementing all of Lance, Emily, and James' tips. 

I still have a few accessories to figure out - storage and something to keep glasses from sliding or rattling on top of the machine. 

And that Presto 12 percolator works really well with paper filters and drip grounds.  Always just right and degrades very slowly.  I also use Melitta pour over, Bialetti Moka pots, and lots of Harney Keemun tea. 

FYI Espresso Parts was very helpful and the coupon code from u/ShedLightCoffee was valuable!  The grinder came from WLL - good price and no issues.  Both places had excellent and informative sales support.

I recently upgraded to a 2000AB and also got myself a Breville Bambino Plus espresso machine. (Note: Flat whites are easy to make with the Bambino Plus’ auto milk frother!) 

I am trying to pick up roasting decaf beans again so that I can make flat whites and lattes in the evenings. 

The problem I have with decaf beans is that I can never seem to get a decaf bean to roast properly. Either too light and sour or bitter charcoal. Nothing in between. 

I roasted a pound of Sweet Maria's Decaf Espresso ""Donkey"" Blend this weekend where I roasted to the start of First Crack and then triggered the cooling cycle.  I got some extremely sour tasting espresso. The puck of coffee grinds was noticeably lighter than my other normal cafe roast. 

For my normal caffeinated roasts, I generally set the Behmor to 1lb and full power P5 until the safety alarm goes off. Then I dial back to P3 until First Crack. After that, I will bump up to P4 and let it roll until Second Crack just starts then I put the Behmor into cooling mode. 

For Decaf roasts, I find it really hard to hear when First Crack happens and when it finishes. And even after that, I almost never hear Second Crack (hence bitter charcoal).  

I learned how to roast coffee by sound and smell - I listen for First and Second Crack. I don’t have the patience to plot out temperature reading over time. 

Are there any fellow Behmor 2000AB Plus roasters out there with tips on how to consistently roast decaf beans? 

Do I need to roast at P4 until First Crack - and then do a little song and dance to the Coffee Roasting Gods that the beans will turn out drinkable? 🤣

Note: I always favor Central and South American beans. When I buy decaf beans from Sweet Marias, they are always Swiss Water Processed.

My fiancé and I are currently planning our honeymoon to Japan and would truly appreciate any advice, tips, or recommendations from this amazing community.

This will be our **first time in Japan in December 2025**, and we’re thinking of spending **around 14 days** with a budget of approximately **¥1,000,000**.

We're not really into theme parks like Disney or Universal, but we're passionate about:

* **Matcha and Coffee**
* **Temples & Buddhism**
* **Yoga & nature**
* **Music**
* **Food & local culture**
* **Adventurous experiences**
* And staying at a nice **Ryokan (with onsen if possible!)**

Our current plan includes **Tokyo, Kyoto**, and possibly **Nagano** (someone recommended it, but we haven’t seen it mentioned much here, would love your thoughts!).

Any suggestions for places, hidden gems, day trips, or general planning tips would mean the world to us. Especially those little details that made your trip extra special.

Since I'm good with them, I stayed and chatted for a while, especially with this guy. We had a really good, friendly conversation, in my opinion, since we have similar interests and things.

About two days ago, this friend of my brother's wrote me on Facebook to ask for my number. I gave it to him because I really like him and I didn't want to seem rude because the guy has never acted that way with me.

He told me he'd like to invite me out for coffee or something so we could talk more, because he liked the moment we shared that day. I didn't dislike the idea, but it still threw me off because I honestly never thought that would happen. I told my mom, who knows my brother's friends very well, and she told me it was better not to accept any of his outings so I wouldn't give him any ""chance"" or make him think I want something with him, and besides, he's ugly, haha. The truth is, I don't know if the guy has any romantic intentions toward me or if he just wants to talk as friends, because that's the only way I could see him.

I really like the guy. He's always been nice to me, and I like him more because of his interests. I would like to go out with him and not at the same time, because I'd like to go out as friends, and as I said before, I don't know if his intentions are romantic or as friends. I don't have many friends, and that's why I'd like to go out to see if it could be a potential friendship or not. I don't see anything wrong with that because, for example, my brother has gone out with girls alone that are his friends supposedly, and in the end, they don't end up being his girlfriends (I mean, I don't know the context of the girls), but the point is that they don't end up being anything. The other thing that stops me is his friendship with my brother, and another thing my mom told me is that if  something awkward or bad happens , I'll keep seeing him because sometimes he comes to my house.

Since I gave him my number, we've talked a little bit via text and I've liked talking to him like that, and I think that if I don't see him I won't know his intentions and it's taking a risk, but I have my dilemma about that and more because of what my mother has told me, who emphasizes his physical appearance more than anything and that he doesn't attract me significantly, but more than anything she doesn't want me to fill the boy with illusions if he really has any.",1,1745295719.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I'm not really looking to date, but have been pulling myself up and back out into the world. As such, a couple months ago I started going to a ballroom dance group as it ticked both the ""*be more social*"" and ""*way outside my comfort zone*"" boxes.

One of the members of the group gives me the ""warm & fuzzy"" vibes, and the couple times we've talked has been engaged and generous in the conversation, and told me that she is a single parent, too. But we've literally only talked a couple times and the group will soon be taking a hiatus for the summer (it's sponsored by the local university). I would like to see if she would be interested in getting coffee together, but I've spent the past few years locked inside myself and my social skills are, frankly, quite rusty.

I worry about coming across as too forward or moving a potential friendship along too fast. She's likely moving to another city later this year, so maybe that unavailability for a relationship is making me feel safer to entertain the idea of spending some time together? I do know one of the other members of the group as a work (though not a social) friend. Would it be crossing a boundary to ask her advice? ...
