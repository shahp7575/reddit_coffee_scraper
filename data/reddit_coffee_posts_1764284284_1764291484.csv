I’m a Beijing-based tech worker. I love seeing more travelers coming to explore China. I'm not a licensed tour guide and I don’t run any travel business, but I thought it might be fun to occasionally spend a half-day hanging out with visitors in Beijing: walking through hutongs, trying some local food, taking the subway, or chatting about Chinese daily life and culture.

A bit about me: I grew up in Shanghai and now work in Beijing. I lived in the US for seven years (went to grad school in Pittsburgh and worked in Seattle), so I’m pretty comfortable with English and explaining Chinese culture from both sides.

This is just for fun and cultural exchange. No set price — maybe just a small tip or coffee if you feel like it.

I work long shifts outdoors, and I’m constantly fighting with my drinks either getting warm way too fast or turning into sad melted-ice water within an hour.

 I’ve been using cheap plastic bottles for years because I always assumed they were basically the same thing, but at this point I’m not so sure.

A friend of mine keeps bragging about how her tumbler still has ice in it after an entire workday, which sounds wild to me because my water is usually room temperature by lunchtime.  


 I’m also trying to cut back on buying cold drinks during the day, so having something reliable that actually keeps things cold might help me stop spending money on random iced coffees.

Before I drop money on one, I want to know from people who actually use them daily.  


 Are they really that much better? Do they hold up long term, or do they lose effectiveness after a while? And is there a noticeable difference between the fancy brands and the cheaper ones?

I was engaged to my ex within 7 months.   It was all very intense and ""perfect.""  But then we put off our wedding.  For 7 years.  While one event after another broke me.   I've read this story on reddit often.  I can't believe I'm living it and never felt prepared.

My ex is currently in another state visiting someone he fell for based on her TikTok videos.  He said she's in a complicated relationship.  She lives with her husband.  He's staying there for two weeks.  He left me on Sunday after months of strange demeanor and rambling about how he felt no one understood him and his politics.

I'm scared and confused.  I now understand the intense relationship we had to basically be a symptom.   But...he seemed to genuinely love me.   We had everything in common.   We had wonderful conversations and laughed all the time.

I know this is a common occurrence for mania.  I read that post where someone talked about the discarding and everything.  But I can't comprehend how the person who was supposed to love me could hear me cry so much with no desire to comfort me.   I feel very alone.

He left me and our cats and all the support I gave him.  He couldn't hold down a job, and it caused a lot of strain in our relationship.   I couldn't understand what was wrong.  Why he seemed to do so well at work at first until he crashed and would quit on a whim.   

I think part of what triggered him were all of the changes in life.  I advanced my career.  His best friend got married.  My best friend has a kid with one on the way.   Politics started getting to him.   After Charlie Kirk was shot, he started insisting politics were changing in an extreme way and he had to be more ""proactive""  But he never gave me a straight answer about what exactly.   So we smoked as he talked in circles.   And now it makes a lot more sense.  The smoking being a terrible idea as well.

We've always had weird, eclectic conversations.  But he has a tendency to get fixated on things and take them too far.  He had just come down from a fixation on AI and how there must be something dangerous they're hiding that's going to take over the world.   And then he started getting obsessed with conspiracies about Charlie Kirk's murder, and getting mad at me for telling him to be careful and keep his thinking in check to not go too far into conspiracy.  He convinced me he had and he was smart enough to not take it too far.   Now I know it's not about intelligence.

He's started being erratic and constantly trying to justify his extreme emotions.  Ranting for long periods of time about why he's right about something.  And then not remembering that he said things.

He became fixated on some political chick's videos.  I always support all of his random interests.  I have a lot of them too.  I thought we bonded over that.  But he started telling me I wasn't doing enough politically.   That my ideals didn't align with his.  He was being mean to me.  He seemed confused when I would tell him.  I genuinely don't know what's happening in his head.

He scared me, and I now understand why.   I understand that his demeanor and facial expressions reminded me of my mother when she was manic.  How she would have to insist that she wasn't mad at me, much like he does.   Because I'm sensitive and read the mania as anger. 

 He started ranting about a video I was watching.  And I started crying because I felt like he was angry with me.   And he got angry with me that I thought he was angry.  And that's how I've lived my life as a kid and now through my 30s.   I still hate accepting this is my current situation.

I don't know how long this will last.  He's been gone for days.  Friends have heard from him.   Nothing substantial.  He seems to truly believe he's found his true self.   He was convinced I had cheated on him already and seemed surprised when I said no.   It was absurd.   

Where do I go with this?  He has keys.  He has to get his stuff.  He promised to clean the mess he never cleaned.   But I'm scared.  This isn't the person I knew.  I'm familiar with things to know I may be at risk.  My parents are gone.  My family doesn't live close.   I've lost my best friend and someone I thought would protect me.  

This is extremely jarring.  I need all the advice.  I'm already in the process of finding a therapist.  
But I can't eat, and I've been subsisting on alcohol and coffee.  I skipped the alcohol today.  I know I'm heading myself down a potentially unhealthy path that can further harm my own mental health.  But this isn't something I can handle.  I'm dreading work tomorrow. 
Do I make a police report?  I have proof of him punching a hole in a door.  It was a while ago.  After he lost a large sum of money to stocks (lol help).  But I'm worried I'll walk in the door and he'll be there.  He's on the lease.

Do I give up on the person I've connected with for almost a decade?  Did I ever know him?  How did I do this for so long?  Will he even get help?  I don't know how to stop worrying.  Is he safe?  I wish i knew.

I am quite new to the espresso community (long time drinker but new maker) 

What I enjoy most is espresso around 1:2 ratio and ristretto 1:1.5 / 1:1 ratio so it's easier for me to dial in for that using what I know about quantity, grinding and pouring time 

What is harder though is for lungos, some friends and family prefer lungo and as much as I would like to keep them to really understand their taste and which setup they like most it's not practical 

So my question is, for those who enjoy lungo as much as espresso, with the same coffee what do you change in order to still get a balance extraction ? 

My insights and tries were to grind coarser and get more water to pass through and results seems ok but I think my tastes are getting in the way so it always seems kinda off

1p8hhsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/hubproducts/comments/1p8hhsw/under_bed_storage_vs_ottomans_whats_the_real/,Under bed storage vs ottomans: what's the real difference?,"When you're trying to maximize space in your bedroom, you've probably looked at both under bed storage and ottomans. They seem similar at first, but they actually serve pretty different purposes. Let's break down what makes each one unique so you can figure out which works better for your situation.

**What is Under Bed Storage?**

Under bed storage is exactly what it sounds like – containers, bins, or drawers that slide beneath your bed frame. This space usually just collects dust and random stuff anyway, so why not organize it? You can store seasonal clothes, extra blankets, shoes, or anything else that's taking up closet space.

The biggest advantage here is that under bed storage doesn't take up any visible floor space. Your room looks clean and open while you're actually hiding a ton of stuff underneath. Most options come with wheels or handles, making it easy to pull them out when you need something.

**What About Ottomans?**

Ottomans are those padded stools or benches that double as storage containers. You lift the top, toss stuff inside, and use the surface as a footrest or extra seating. They're great for living rooms, entryways, or the foot of your bed.

The main difference is that ottomans sit out in the open and serve multiple functions. You get storage plus a place to sit or prop up your feet. Some people even use them as makeshift coffee tables.

**Space Considerations**

If floor space is tight, under bed storage wins every time. You're using an area that would otherwise be wasted. Check out these [under bed storage options](https://athomewave.com/under-bed-storage) if you want to see how much you can actually fit under there.

Ottomans need their own dedicated spot in your room. They add furniture to your space rather than hiding things away. That said, if you have room and need extra seating, an ottoman pulls double duty.

**Storage Capacity**

Under bed storage bins typically hold more stuff. A standard queen-size bed can fit multiple large containers underneath, giving you several cubic feet of storage space. You can organize things by season, category, or however you want.

Ottomans usually hold less because they need to stay light enough to move around and support weight on top. They're better for storing smaller items like remotes, magazines, throw blankets, or craft supplies.

**Accessibility**

Here's where things get interesting. Ottomans are easier to access – just lift the lid and grab what you need. Under bed storage requires you to kneel down and pull out containers, which can be annoying if you need something quickly.

However, if you're storing seasonal items or things you rarely use, that extra effort doesn't really matter. You'll probably only access your [under bed storage](https://athomewave.com/under-bed-storage) a few times per year anyway.

**Cost Comparison**

Under bed storage containers are generally cheaper. Basic plastic bins start around $15-30, while fancier fabric options with zippers might run $40-60. You can buy multiple containers and still spend less than a single quality ottoman.

Ottomans range from $50 for basic models up to several hundred dollars for nicer upholstered pieces. You're paying for furniture that looks good, not just storage functionality.

**Which Should You Choose?**

Go with under bed storage solutions if you need maximum storage capacity without eating up floor space. They're perfect for small bedrooms, apartments, or anyone who needs to store bulky seasonal items.

Choose an ottoman if you need furniture anyway and want bonus storage. They work great in living rooms or large bedrooms where you have space for additional pieces.

Some people use both – under bed storage for big stuff you rarely need, and ottomans for everyday items in high-traffic areas. There's no rule saying you can't combine storage solutions.

The bottom line is that under bed storage beats ottomans for pure storage capacity and space efficiency. Ottomans win for style and multi-functionality. Think about what matters more for your specific situation, and you'll know which direction to go.",1,1764290613.0,hubproducts,0,1.0,False

That’s insane.” I had my husband look and he didn’t see anything. The nails are bright and not tiny so we thought it impossible that it was lodged in my ear. I figured it had just come off while I was making coffee or something. 

The next couple days, I started developing a weird feeling of fullness in my ear, but it wasn’t painful. I put some ear drops in to clean it out which seemed to help.

I am a coffee hater looking for some help on a gift for my girlfriend, who is a big coffee nerd. 

She has a pretty nice set up with all of the fancy espresso gear (I even learned from her how to pronounce espresso, in a cool way), I think, a super nice drip machine, and a fancy grinder. 

From my subtle investigation, I believe the one area she is lacking, aside from those absurd $1000 automatic machines (I love her, but I am a teacher...so...), is a quality stand alone milk frother.  

I'm pretty sure She has one of those wand ones, but I think she doesn't like it, and was saying she missed making cortados.

I was thinking this could be a good gift, but, due to my dislike of coffee and absolutely lack of knowledge I am not sure what would be a quality upgrade for her.

Confusion prickles down my arms. I don't know anyone with a newborn. 
A second cry pierces through the speaker.

Candles flicker against the crystal glasses, casting soft golden light across the silk dress I stupidly chose because I wanted tonight to feel special. Because ten years of marriage should mean something. Because I still believed in anniversaries and promises and the idea that love could grow instead of rot.
And because Theo said he'd try to be home ""by eight, latest.""

Running late. Big meeting. Don't wait up to eat.

Champagne chills in the bucket beside me, tiny bubbles clinging to the glass like they're trying to hold on to hope too.
God, I'm pathetic.
I smooth a hand over my dress, forcing down the stupid flutter in my stomach. I know Theo. I know his brain works in deadlines and schedules and emergencies that always seem more urgent than us. He's not cruel—just consumed. And I've learned to live with the parts of him I can't change.
I pick up the bottle to pour myself a drink.
That's when my phone buzzes.

A baby's cry.
Light. New. Fragile.
Confusion prickles down my arms. I don't know anyone with a newborn. Theo doesn't either. His coworkers all have older kids. His brother's children are teenagers.
A second cry pierces through the speaker.
Then the world stops.
Theo's voice—low, gentle, nothing like the clipped tone he uses with investors—fills my ear.
""It's okay, Thea. Daddy's here.""
I freeze.
Every bone in my body goes cold.
Daddy.
I replay it, hoping—begging—my ears are lying. My heart is sprinting so fast it feels like it's cracking against my ribs.
But the message plays exactly the same.
A woman cooing.A baby whimpering.Theo whispering comfort.
I don't realize I've dropped the champagne bottle until it hits the edge of the bucket, slips, and crashes onto the floor. Glass bursts across the tile. My phone slips from my hand and hits the ground with a hollow smack.
I don't pick it up.
I can't move.
The candlelight trembles. My vision blurs. The room feels warped—like I've stepped out of my life and into someone else's nightmare.
No tears. Not yet. Not even anger. Just a heavy, breath-stealing shock.
My husband—my husband—has a baby.
A baby with a name he said like it belongs to him.A baby he held.A baby crying in the background of his voicemail like she is part of his life. His world.
His child.
Not mine.
A sound leaves my throat—half gasp, half choke—but I clamp my hand over my mouth as if that can stop my world from falling apart.
I don't know how long I stand there. Seconds. Minutes. Hours. Time isn't real anymore.
My phone buzzes again.
Once.Twice.Then nonstop.
Buzz.Buzz.Buzzz—
The vibration jolts me back into my body. I finally kneel to grab it, my hands shaking so violently I drop it once before getting a grip.
Notifications flood the screen faster than I can register them.
Sabrina Vale posted a new video.You've been tagged in a post.Theo Hale trending #1 worldwide.BREAKING: THEO HALE SEEN AT HOSPITAL WITH NEWBORN—VIDEO INSIDE.
No.No, no, no.
My fingers go numb as I tap one of the links.
It opens instantly.
The video quality is too clear. Painfully clear. Someone was close—close enough to capture every intimate detail.
Theo stands in a hospital room, wearing a soft gray shirt I've washed a thousand times. His hair is messy in a way I've only ever seen after he's been running his hands through it.
And he's holding her.
The baby.
Tiny. Wrapped in a pink blanket. Her fist gripping the edge of his shirt like she knows him. Like she belongs to him.
Like he belongs to her.
Theo looks exhausted. Not corporate-exhausted. Something deeper. Something raw. Something I've never seen.
He rocks the baby gently, whispering something against her forehead. The camera zooms in. He presses the lightest ki-ss to her skin.
A woman—blurred, but visibly younger—rests against the pillow. Ivy Cross. I recognize her instantly. The face plastered across gossip accounts for weeks now. The girl people whispered about. The one with the pretty mouth and the reputation for ""getting involved"" with powerful men.
She looks toward Theo with damp eyes. Not seductive. Not smug. Just... worn down.
The room spins. My heart feels like it's being sliced open from the inside.
My thumb hits the edge of the screen and the video loops—Theo's soft ki-ss replaying again.
And again.And again.
My breath shudders out of me.
I stumble backward until I hit the wall. My shoulder knocks a picture frame off the shelf. It clatters to the floor, cracking down the center. I force myself to look.
It's a photo of us from three years ago. Theo lifting me onto his back on some beach trip his assistant forced him to take. I'm laughing. His eyes are on me, not the camera. It was one of the rare moments he wasn't consumed by work, by pressure, by everything heavy he carries inside.
I sink down beside the broken frame, hugging my knees, trying to breathe.
My phone buzzes again.
I glance at it.
Theo Hale (12 missed calls).Theo Hale (Message: ""Lila. Please pick up."")Miles Hale (1 missed call).Jace Rowe (Message: ""Call me. Now."")
Everything burns—my chest, my throat, my eyes.
My ten-year marriage ends in a thirty-second voicemail.
And the world knows before I do.
I press my forehead to my knees, but the buzzing doesn't stop. It gets louder. More frantic. Like the whole world has decided to witness my humiliation in real time.
Another wave of notifications explodes across my screen:
Sabrina Vale: ""This is insane. You guys—THE VIDEO. OMG.""BREAKING: WHO IS THE BABY'S MOTHER?Has Lila Hart been living a lie?
My hands curl into fists.
This isn't fair.This isn't real.This cannot be happening to me.
I force the air into my lungs, shaky and uneven. My chest feels too tight, my body too small to hold this much pain.
The last time Theo and I talked, we argued about schedules. About how he promised to take a weekend off and didn't. About how I felt invisible, and he said I was being ""dramatic.""
If only I'd known.
If only I'd listened to the ache in my gut instead of brushing it aside and telling myself he was just stressed.
My phone lights up again.
Another voicemail.From him.
I stare at the screen like it might explode.
I can't listen.I can't hear his voice again.Not after the last one destroyed me.
The champagne on the floor is spreading, soaking into the cracks of the tile. The room smells like sweetness and broken glass.
My silk dress suddenly feels stupid. Too tight. Too hopeful.
I stand. My legs almost buckle. I lean against the table for balance.
The candles flicker harder now, shadows moving across the walls like ghosts I didn't invite.
I grab my phone with trembling fingers and scroll, desperate for something—anything—to anchor me. But every notification hits me like a slap.
The internet knows.His company knows.Reporters know.Strangers know.
Everyone knows.
Except me.His wife.
A hot tear slips down my cheek. The first one. I wipe it away quickly, but more come. Quiet. Angry. Devastated.
I grip the back of the chair and breathe through the shaking.
This isn't a crack in the foundation.It's an earthquake.
My phone vibrates again.Then again.Then again.
It doesn't stop.
A part of me wants to smash it against the wall just to make the noise go away.
But I don't.
Because if I do, I'll never know the next truth waiting to ambush me.
I finally unlock the screen.
A final notification sits at the top.
Trending: #PrayForLila
My stomach turns.
I'm not dead.
But maybe my marriage is.
I look around the room—at the candles, the champagne, the stupid anniversary decorations I put up like a hopeful idiot—and I do something I haven't done in a long, long time.
I exhale.
Slow.Broken.Final.
Then I turn off the candles.Step over the glass.Walk to my bedroom.
And close the door on the life I thought I had.
Because nothing—absolutely nothing—will ever be the same again.
The Internet Eats Its Queen
Lila
By morning, the internet has already eaten me alive.
My face—the hollow-eyed, she-ll-shocked version of me standing alone in my dining room—is now a meme, a GIF, a trending template for jokes I never asked to be part of.
I shouldn't look.I know I shouldn't.But my fingers betray me every time.
WHEN YOU FIND OUT YOU'RE THE PROBLEM, NOT THE MAIN CHARACTER
WHEN YOUR MAN HAS MORE NDAs THAN EMOTIONS
WHEN YOU ORDER A HUSBAND ON AMAZON BUT GET A BABY-DADDY SURPRISE PACK
People are... talented. Awful, but talented.
I toss my phone onto the couch and drag a blanket tighter around my shoulders, wishing it were a shield big enough to block the entire world. It still smells faintly like Theo—clean soap and something expensive—but I force myself not to think about that.
My house is dim except for the pale morning light squeezing through the blinds. I haven't opened the curtains. I'm not stupid. Paparazzi are probably outside like raccoons waiting for trash night.
My stomach twists.
Trash.That's what I feel like.Leftovers of the life I thought I had.
The door slams open hard enough to rattle the windows.
Mara.
Of course.
""I come bearing vengeance, carbs, and accessories for murder,"" she announces before she even steps fully inside.
In her right hand? A dozen donuts.In her left? A baseball bat.
I blink. ""Please tell me that's for emotional support.""
""It's for cracking skulls,"" she says cheerfully, kicking the door shut with her foot. ""Where is he? Where is that filthy, two-timing, billionaire sewage rat? I'll go feral.""
""You can't commit homicide before I've had coffee.""
""Watch me."" She tosses the donut box onto the coffee table, rounds the couch, and drops beside me. ""Oh my god."" Her face softens. ""You look like you were hit by a Black Friday sale.""
""Thanks.""
""Oh, sweetheart..."" Mara pulls me into a hug before I can dodge. ""You deserve better. And by better, I mean a man who doesn't have a surprise baby popping out like an unwanted plot twist.""
I snort into her shoulder. ""Plot twist implies the story was well-written.""
She squeezes tighter. ""Say the word and I'll drive over to his company and TP the headquarters.""
""No.""
""Okay, egg his house?""
""No.""
""Slash his tires? Just one. I'm not a monster.""
I pull back enough to look at her. ""Mara.""
""What? I have a baseball bat and rage. Let me be useful.""
I manage a tiny laugh. It feels strange—like my face forgot how to make the shape—but it's still something.
My phone buzzes under the blanket.
Mara's eyes sharpen. ""Is that him?""
I don't answer.
She prowls across the couch, snatches the phone, and squints at the screen. ""Thirty-eight missed calls? Is he deranged? Does he think you're going to pick up and say, 'Hey babe, sorry I missed your earlier voicemail about the INFANT?'""
I bury my face in my hands. ""I don't know what to do.""
""Yes, you do,"" she says simply.
""No, I really don't.""
""Fine. Then do nothing. Honestly, nothing sounds perfect. Therapeutic, even."" She flips my phone upside down and slides it under a pillow like she's tucking away a bomb. ""I'm invoking a strict ignore-the-man-child rule.""
""He's not a man-child.""
Mara snorts. ""Sweetheart, the man has a hidden baby with a woman who still looks like she's waiting for her college ID to expire.""
I wince. ""Ivy looks older than that.""
""She looks like she sprained something trying to say photosynthesis."" Mara crosses her arms. ""And don't defend her. She slept with your husband.""
My throat tightens. ""He slept with her.""
Mara softens. ""Yeah. He did.""
The room sinks into quiet.
There's something humiliating about grief. Not the dramatic kind you can shout or cry through—no, the quiet kind. The kind that sinks under your ribcage until you feel hollow, like someone carved you out and forgot to leave anything behind.
I curl deeper into the blanket. ""I don't understand how I didn't know. How did he hide a baby from me?""
""Because men are terrible.""
""That's not an explanation.""
""It's the only explanation."" Mara taps my forehead. ""He hid it. Deliberately. Purposefully. With full awareness his wife—you—would be shattered.""
My voice cracks. ""I don't understand why.""
""You will,"" she says. ""Once we peel the skin off his lies.""
I choke out a laugh. ""Please stop talking like you're the villain of a Disney movie.""
""No promises.""
She grabs a donut and thrusts it into my hand. ""Eat. Sugar stabilizes emotional devastation. It's science.""
I nibble the corner like an exhausted squirrel.
She beams. ""Look at you. Consuming carbs. I'm so proud.""
Another notification buzzes somewhere under the pillow.
Mara's expression ices over. ""If that's Theo, I'm going to block his number with my aura.""
I bury my face in the blanket. ""Please don't say aura.""
""Oh, I'll say aura. I'll say it aggressively.""
""You're exhausting.""
""And yet, you love me.""
She leans forward to grab the remote and turns on the TV. Bad idea. The screen lights up with a news anchor announcing:
""The Hale Baby Scandal continues to dominate social media—""
""Nope,"" Mara says, lunging forward to change the channel so fast she nearly unplugs the TV. ""Absolutely not. We're not letting toxic sludge into our eyeballs.""
I rub my temples. ""The fact that they're calling it the Hale Baby Scandal makes me want to walk into traffic.""
""Well, technically it's accurate.""
""Mara.""
""Too soon. Got it.""
My phone buzzes again—an aggressive, demanding vibration that doesn't stop.
""I swear if he calls fifty times, I'm hexing him,"" she mutters.
I sigh. ""One more call won't change anything.""
""No,"" she says gently, ""but answering him could.""
I swallow hard. ""I'm not ready to hear his voice.""
Mara takes my hand. ""Then you don't. Not until you want to. Not until he deserves it.""
My eyes sting, but tears don't fall. They feel lodged somewhere deeper. Heavier.
We sit there for a while. Me, wrapped in a blanket. Mara, holding a bat and a donut. The two stages of womanhood.
And then the TV flashes with a notification banner.
A trending alert.
Another.
And another.
Mara narrows her eyes. ""What the he-ll is hitting the internet now?""
Before I can stop her, she grabs my phone from under the pillow and unlocks it.
Her entire body goes rigid.
""What?"" I whisper.
""Oh... oh, you're gonna want to see this."" She turns the phone around.
The notification at the top reads:
Sabrina Vale uploaded a new video:THE HALE BABY SCANDAL — WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.
My stomach drops through the floor.
Mara lets out a low whistle. ""Welp. There it is. The world is about to take your private life, put it in a blender, and add subtitles.""
I stare at the screen until the letters blur.
I'm not breathing.I'm not blinking.I'm not ready.
Mara puts the phone down gently, as if it's a detonator.
""Lila..."" her voice softens. ""You don't have to watch it right now.""
But I already know I will.
Because whatever Sabrina posted—whatever she claims happened—it's going to spread fast.Faster than the voicemail.Faster than the memes.Faster than my heart can catch up.
I inhale sharply, but it doesn't feel like air reaches my lungs.
Mara leans forward, ready to fight the whole world for me. ""You're not alone. I'm here. And if Sabrina lies, I swear on my future unborn children, I'm doxxing her.""
""Mara—""
""Try me.""
But I can't answer.Because everything in my life has already exploded...and somehow, this feels like the match.
I look at the screen one more time.
THE HALE BABY SCANDAL — WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.
My blood runs cold.
The world is about to rewrite my story without asking my permission.
And I'm not sure I'm strong enough to watch.
Billionaire on Fire
Theo
My life is burning.
Not figuratively. Literally. My PR team is melting down in real time on a thirty-foot screen while my CFO swears he can ""hear investors sharpening their knives.""
I stand in the center of my office—top floor, glass walls, a panoramic view of the city that doesn't feel impressive anymore—and rub the bridge of my nose hard enough to bruise.
On one screen:News channels looping the same thirty-second video like it's a paid advertisement.
On another:Emails from the board demanding emergency meetings.
On a third:Lila's face.Frozen. Pale. Broken.
That picture is the one I can't look at for more than a second without feeling like my lungs collapse.
""Okay,"" Jace says, pacing so aggressively the carpet might start smoking. ""Okay, okay—let's list priorities so I don't have a stroke."" He lifts a shaky finger. ""One: Contain the media. Two: Issue a statement. Three: Pray the stock doesn't nosedive. Four: Figure out whether you want to live or if I should put you out of your misery now.""
He looks at me like I'm the one who set the building on fire.
Maybe I did.
I drag a hand through my hair. ""This didn't need to happen like this.""
""No,"" he snaps. ""It needed to happen privately, quietly, months ago when I told you to tell her before the universe did it for you. But here we are. Universe: one. Theo: negative twelve.""
I don't argue. He's right.And I hate that he's right.
My phone hasn't stopped buzzing since last night.Lila hasn't answered once.
Thirty-eight calls, twenty messages, five voicemails from me—all ignored.
My chest tightens with panic I don't allow myself to show. Not in front of the board. Not in front of the world. But Jace sees the crack in my composure anyway.
He sighs and stops pacing. ""Theo... it's bad out there.""
He gestures toward the window. Down below, the front gates of my home are swarmed with paparazzi—camera flashes like lightning, voices shouting my name as if I owe them something. They camped out all night. They'll be here all day.
I can't even go home.I can't get to my wife.I can't fix anything.
""Has she seen the video?"" I ask, even though I already know the answer.
Jace looks at me like he wants to punch me too. ""Everyone on the planet has seen the video.""
My stomach twists. ""Lila didn't deserve any of this.""
""No sh-it.""
I inhale slowly, forcing the breath to actually reach my lungs. ""I need to talk to her.""
""You need to handle your PR crisis before the investors throw you into a volcano.""
I shoot him a glare.
He holds up both hands. ""I'm just saying—your entire empire is about to crumble, and also your marriage is in shambles, and also the world thinks you're the father of the year while simultaneously calling you the world's worst husband. It's complicated.""
I try not to punch a window.
Jace grabs the remote and flips the channel. ""Here. Look at this.""
The screen changes to Sabrina Vale—a woman who built her entire career on spilling celebrity blood in soft lighting and great makeup.
She's sitting in a chair, leaning toward the camera with predatory excitement.
My stomach drops.
""Turn it off,"" I mutter.
""No. You need to see how bad it is.""
I grit my teeth as Sabrina begins:
""The Hale Baby Scandal—yes, we're calling it that—is spiraling faster than any story this year. And the real question is... what did Lila Hart know? Was she blindsided? Or was she covering for him?""
My jaw clenches so hard it aches. ""She didn't know anything.""
Jace nods. ""We know that. The world doesn't.""
Sabrina keeps going, milking every second of my collapse.
""Sources say Theo Hale has been secretly visiting the child for months—""
""That's not true."" My voice is sharp enough to cut glass. ""I saw her twice. Twice. Both times were emergencies.""
""I know,"" Jace says. ""But once a rumor starts—""
""—it becomes truth,"" I finish bitterly.
My temples throb. My hands shake. Every regret I've been burying for months claws its way back to the surface.
""There has to be a way to fix this,"" I say.
Jace gives me a look that says even he doesn't believe that. ""Your only fix is Lila.""
My breath halts.
""She needs to hear the truth from you,"" he continues. ""But you waited too long. And now the truth has a trending hashtag.""
I close my eyes because for once in my life, I don't have an answer.Not for the board.Not for the public.Not for her.
Especially not for her.
""I shouldn't have sent that voicemail,"" I mutter.
""You didn't mean to send it.""
""That doesn't matter. She heard it. She heard everything.""
He falls silent.
I walk to my desk, pick up my phone, and scroll through my voicemail list. The one she heard sits at the top, mocking me.
I press play.
The moment my voice comes through the speaker—soft, quiet, the voice I only ever use when I'm trying to be gentle—I feel sick.
""It's okay, Thea. Daddy's here.""
I flinch.
Hearing it now is worse than it was then. Because I know exactly how it sounded to Lila.Like love.Like devotion.Like betrayal wrapped in a lullaby.
Jace watches me silently, jaw tight.
I pause the recording halfway through, unable to listen anymore. ""I never wanted her to find out like this.""
""You didn't want her to find out at all,"" Jace says quietly. ""That's the problem.""
I shove the phone away. ""I was trying to protect her.""
""No."" His voice is firm. ""You were trying to protect yourself.""
I want to deny it. Argue. Fight.But he's right.
I was scared.Scared she'd leave.Scared she'd look at me differently.Scared that the one good thing in my life—Lila—would slip out of my hands.
And now she has.
The phone rings again.
Not Lila.Miles.
Great.
I ignore it.
The phone rings again.
Jace raises a brow. ""You should answer that.""
""He's going to scream at me.""
""Probably.""
""He's going to threaten me.""
""Definitely.""
""He's going to call me every synonym for idiot in the dictionary.""
Jace shrugs. ""He's not wrong.""
I glare at him.
But before I can pick up, the office door slams open with enough force to shake the glass wall.
Miles.
Perfectly tailored suit.Perfectly combed hair.Perfectly furious.
""Are you out of your mind?"" he snaps.
Jace mutters, ""Here we go,"" and backs away slowly like he's avoiding friendly fire.
Miles doesn't wait for permission to enter. He storms up to me, eyes blazing, chest heaving like he sprinted all the way here.
""You. Absolute. Moron.""
""Good to see you too,"" I say dryly.
He grabs my shirt. Actually grabs it. ""Do you have any idea what you've done to her?""
My jaw tightens. ""I know.""
""No, you don't. Because if you did, you'd be crawling through broken glass to get to her, not standing in this office behind your godda-mn fortress of screens.""
""I can't get to her,"" I snap. ""There are paparazzi everywhere.""
""Climb a fence. Dig a tunnel. Teleport."" His voice cracks with rage. ""You don't let her be alone right now.""
I swallow hard. ""She won't answer my calls.""
Miles releases me with a shove. ""Well, she sure as he-ll isn't going to answer after that voicemail.""
Jace winces. ""Oof.""
Miles rounds on him. ""You—stop making commentary.""
""Right. Muted. Got it.""
Miles turns back to me. His voice lowers, but the fury in his eyes is nuclear. ""Fix it.""
""I'm trying,"" I say.
""Try harder.""
""I don't know how.""
Miles' nostrils flare. ""Then figure it out.""
He steps closer, voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. ""Because if you hurt her again—if you make her cry one more time—I swear to God, Theo...""
Before I can respond, before I can even breathe—His fist swings.
Fast.Sharp.Unrestrained.
It connects with my jaw so hard my head snaps to the side.
Pain shoots down my neck.The room goes quiet.Jace curses somewhere behind me.
I steady myself with a hand on the desk.
Miles wipes his knuckles on his sleeve, expression unbothered. ""That's for Lila.""
I touch my jaw and taste blood.
I deserve it.
I know I do.
He steps back, breathing hard. ""Now get your sh-it together.""
The door slams behind him.
Jace stares at me. ""Well... on the bright side, that's the least physical pain you're going to feel this week.""
I don't answer.
Because all I can think about is Lila—her silence, her pain, her face when she heard that voicemail.
I look out the window again.

Been adjusting well to the meds. 
I started on 2.5mg in September at 87kg but had begun exercising properly from mid-August when I was 91kg. I’m now 77kg and am now on my second month of 5mg. Side effects on the 2.5mg were nausea, food suppression and a lot of burping. Now however I’m finding I have terrible sudden spells of dizziness. 

I have porridge or a protein pudding for breakfast, a big salad with either steak or chicken for lunch and I don’t always have dinner as I’m not hungry or I’ll have something like a bolognese, steak and salad, homemade chicken tikka etc. I only drink water, no fizzy drinks, no tea, coffee, alcohol. A glass of water with electrolytes in the morning is all then just water. 

I’ve added a glass of orange juice in case it’s sugar levels dropping but I’m finding it strange that I’m suddenly getting these.

So I purchased coffee beans from slow bloom, coffee roasters they have been resting for about 10 days or maybe a little longer. No air is in the bags.

No air, and now it's been rested sometime and I have no air at all. On these three bags ? The only thing I could think of as maybe it was sitting on their shelf and not roasted to order since the dates that are on here. White sticky tabs and not handwriting, which could mean that they have roasted them prior I would not know how long and then put the stickers on them. Why else would there be no air at all ?? So yes, I'm letting the days go on. I'm concerned that if they've been rested sometime now. My coffee will not taste as good. Flat maybe.

1p8ha42,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1p8ha42/looking_for_a_new_grinder_600/,Looking for a new grinder [$600],"I have the Eureka Mignon Specialita for years now and modded it with a single dosing bellow, trying to get a low retention, most of the times 17.9gr of the 18gr in. I also have a cheap blade grinder for filter coffee, which I drink more than espresso.

The advice I am looking for is, should I add a Fellow Ode Gen 2 to my setup to upgrade my filter grinder, which we drink a lot and keep the specialita which I could upgrade with the new dial, maby an angled base plate.

Or should I look into buying a Eureka Zero 65 AP or Eureka Single Dose Pro? This will be used then to switch between espresso and filter. A good sidenote is that I love how quiet the Specialita is.

For a while now, each week for the game I Admin I ask my players a set of availability questions. This has carried on throughout the years through the TTRPGs I run, and it's always in the style of (Yes: Is there mercy in your heart? Why? || No: A gif of a boat (or some different question)) in order for me to gauge who'll be there that week + allowing for narrative prep time if it's a no (or a cancel if it's >1/2).

Last week's availability question:

""Should you survive to become a Blackcoat Virtue yourself, what would you embody in name? What'd be your signature Blasphemy? And, the hex color of your book entry.""

Think - laying on the couch, giving each other massages and venting like free, 2 sided therapy, and helping each other relax (my thing is head scratches :) )

**The guy who you'd be meeting (Me):**

* It's very obvious that I workout. I was skinny growing up, and worked out like a maniac for the last 3 years, so naturally I have very low body fat, and muscle that's very visible and dense to the touch. 5’10”. 160lb.
* Brown hair, reasonably attractive, pretty crazy eyes(sometimes I scare myself in the mirror with such intense eyes after a long day lmao)
* Hygienic(makes me sad that I actually have to say this... I don't belong on reddit)
* Obsessive - This is really the #1 thing to know about me and it's my greatest weakness and biggest strength, and it's in everything. Not obsessive in the way you're thinking either... I like to win and not in a small way. Like at the gym 99% effort given is unacceptable, same goes for work. The company I run consumes every single corner of my being, and failure of the business I see as equivalent to the failure of my life, which is probably why it's done so much.
* I'm an extrovert, through and through, but my entire childhood I was super shy hahaha. I love people. The various challenges I faced forced most of the shyness out of me.
* Introspective - I think, like an alarming amount about *what* I'm thinking and why I'm thinking it. I understand myself better than I think most people do.
* Very much a leader. People always seem to look to me when there's stress or they can't believe they can do something, which I can't sympathize with but I definitely understand. I suppose I have a high pain tolerance too which helps.
* Highly confident in myself - I'm always public speaking, meeting with ranking members of society.
* I'm endlessly curious, like I could listen to people in the sciences just talk and talk and talk about their work for hours at a time. So if you have an interesting job, I want to hear it!!
* Big fan of deep conversations, I'm all about that ""large"" talk, small talk is boring and cheap and fake, and I feel like no one likes it, but for some reason we continue it.
* Despite all of this hard exterior, I'm kinda a softie, I like dogs, sunshine, rainbows, kids, head scratches, cuddling and being comforted and all that.
* I believe I'm quite funny, I crack myself up rather a lot...

**The person I'd love to meet (You):**

* You're fun, ideally undergoing some similar burden, sharing similar traits to me, but I totally get there will never be a 100% match.
* Bonus points if you:
   * also run a business
   * are introspective
   * have an interesting job
   * are intelligent and well-regulated
   * obsessed and/or ambitious
   * dislike talking about events/people
   * enjoy talking about ideas
* Uh ohs
   * Distant - nonchalant people are BOOORRRRINNNNGGGG
   * Immaturity

But really at the end of the day I don't expect you to be even similar to me. Life is tough as it is without adding all these additional requirements for happiness, it's perfectly fine (better even) to just... be.

Anyway, if you got through that congrats. I'm not in a rush for everything, but there's also nothing more painful for me then moving slow, so we'll find a balance. I'd like to talk a bit, once we click, I'll buy you a coffee.

I love in absolute, I only ever want someone I am seeing to know the whole truth of who I am and be fully genuine with them, trust is a massive thing for me and I’ll never lie to someone especially when they are my partner as I think even white lies can start habits that develop into worse things. 

My last relationship ended due to my ex clearly breaching boundaries and when I tried to talk to her in a very neutral way about how it made me feel she completely invalidated the way I felt telling me I was being ridiculous. I failed after that by shutting down and not trying to talk to her again at a better time. This slowly brought tension in between us that only got worse because we never dealt with the issue and stopped being open, honest and talking to each other. 

After we split (she ended things for what seemed like MH reasons) I tried to be understanding and look out for her as much as possible. I gave her all the space in the world, she told me she loved me, missed me and saw me as her forever person.  She would then stop messaging me for a week at a time and often come back to me in a very platonic or ‘dead’ kind of manner. It’s been a good 5 months and I’ve not tried seeing anyone else but slept around a bit whilst travelling again in September. 

I’ve just seen she had a post with another guy on her story at home playing chess on a board I got made for her birthday and it’s come as she also asked me out for a coffee  and continues to tell me she misses me.

This guy was at a wedding they both went to back in June when we were still together and she came back from it acting very cold with me before she ended things. I can’t tell you for certain that they are more than friends but I expect so.

I’m just trying to understand if there’s any point to me seeing people the way I do. I’m inherently monogamous and I have always given someone my all, if I’m seeing someone far past the first date I’m probably envisioning sticking with you in the long haul and would never jeopardise that in any way. 

Yet I feel like I’ve been stepped out on a couple of times. It feels like I should just fuck being what seems to be an actual caring person that wants to get to know everything about you and build a life around you and just fuck around, I do pretty well for dating when I put in a basic effort and I only seem to get stung when I try to make something serious with someone.  

Is the bachelor life just for me and should I give up caring past the carnal pleasures of spending time with women?

It is it possible that I can still find someone who actually wants to build something together and enjoy life that doesn’t say they ‘have a hard time with boundaries’ or still seems to rely on their attractiveness to people for validation? 

Bit of a vent, but I’m seriously on the cusp of changing my mind to just ‘find women to f!£&’ as opposed to ‘find a woman to love’.",2,1764289338.0,Adulting,1,0.75,False

I think compared to the average latte buyer, I’m SUPER picky. I find most coffee shops are just doing it because it’s in right now, and don’t actually have high standards for what they pull.

Growing up I couldn’t really distinguish what “notes” in coffee meant. I had no spectrum or scale to really taste it. 

At home, I’ve been using a Nespresso and only the blonde vertuo pods. (I guess that means I like a light roast?). My entire day is based on that morning latte, but I’ve grown kinda tired of it. 

I moved to the east coast from los angeles (unfortunately). 

I came back to visit, had an iced breve machiatto from Maru and then a vanilla bean latte, and it framed my entire day. They were SO good, I remembered why I love a high quality iced latte so much! I was surprised at my own reaction.  It was light, sweet, chocolatey. 

I immediately started researching what products they use, and what the most affordable at home alternatives are.

I know 50% of it is the grinder (they use the fellow grinder it seems? Thoughts?). I’m having a hard time figuring out what machine to go with first, what I lose out on by not spending more than 350$. I know to avoid Breville (maybe?) and DeLonghi, heard recs for Casabrew, Gaggia. 

I don’t super need a steamer, I don’t love things hot. 

So if ya’ll have espresso vocab basics, recommendations of your own, even Black Friday deals to take advantage of- it’d be much appreciated!

Regarding price limit, I’m still getting a gauge of whats reasonable and not- and whether I should just save up a ton for a good quality machine at home or start out with a beginner one. Or get a decent one and do a ton of mods (?) . Unsure.

I skipped the sugar.,"I'm new to pie making, and at the same time have been drastically reducing my sugar intake, opting more for fresh fruit and other natural sugars.  I can't tell if these recipes are just grossly oversweet or if I just don't like sugar anymore.  They aren't baked yet, so no idea what the final product is like.  I don't eat a lot of pie, can't remember the last time I've had pumpkin or pecan, but I do know I loved pecan pie growing up.  I also however know that I used to dip a solid bar of sugar into colored powdered sugar as a candy treat so young me didn't exactly have a particularly refined palette.  Older, mature, cooking me wants balanced flavors where I can taste all the ingredients, and perhaps even a bit of a je-ne-sais-quoi in there.  I don't even like sweet tea, and these days honestly I typically take my coffee as just a plain latte - the steamed whole milk is often sweet enough for me.   So I'd like your feedback on the recipes and my decision to avoid adding extra sugar to them. 

\- Pumpkin Pie from  [All Recipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23439/perfect-pumpkin-pie/) \- sponsored by the condensed milk company - yeah yeah I know but it also have over 4 stars / 3k reviews.   I doubled it for two pies, so that's 30 oz of pumpkin and two cans of sweetened condensed milk.  I added a single 29 oz can of pumpkin and tasted it, and really liked it !  TBH I could have done the pumpkin by itself with a bit of spice and now I'm thinking about other ways to incorporate pumpking into meals.     I then added a SINGLE can of sweetened condensed milk and my god it is incredibly sugary stuff.  I stopped there.  It was already an overly sweet mixture and threatening to overbear any actual pumpkin flavor.   Kept same seasoning and eggs.  I think maybe I could have added some unsweetened condensed milk, or evaporated milk, but those ingredients are pretty new to me and I don't know how interchangeable they are - I just didn't want any more sugar added. 

\- Pecan Pie from [Sally's Baking Addiction](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/my-favorite-pecan-pie-recipe/).  I really like her website and use her pie crust recipe.  For pecan, doubling the recipe it calls for two cups of corn syrup.  Now honestly I'm not very experienced with corn sugar but I tasted it and yeah it's basically semi-solid sugar.  Stupidly sweet.   So I added the butter, eggs and seasoning and skipped the FULL CUP of brown sugar the recipe then calls for (remember, doubling).   Like this corn syrup is already sickeningly sweet and I just can't imagine adding extra sugar to it.

I was struck by hearing their stories firsthand. One guy described how Filipino fishing communities were losing their livelihoods to the mining industry-some of them apparently had ties to Australian companies. Another talked about rising sea levels in the Pacific Ocean and how the people he lived with were literally watching their islands disappear. He wasn't preaching to them, but simply genuinely caring about those he knew as friends.  
  
They explained that [https://columban.org.au/](https://columban.org.au/) focuses on issues of ""Peace, Ecology, and Justice""-linking environmental destruction with poverty and violence, rather than considering them separately. Frankly, that's not what I expected from missionaries.

1p8gsfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Procrastinationism/comments/1p8gsfs/i_read_40_books_last_year_and_heres_what_i_learned/,I read 40+ books last year and here's what I learned,"this year I set an ambitious goal to read one book per week. I ended up finishing 44 books across fiction, non-fiction, and self-improvement genres.

Here's everything that worked, everything that failed, and the surprising lessons I learned about reading in 2024.

What DIDN'T work:

Speed reading techniques are BS. All those speed reading methods online are mostly garbage. I spent weeks trying different techniques and apps (tried several on both iOS and Android), but faster reading meant worse comprehension. Sometimes slower is actually faster.

Reading only self-improvement books. I burned out hard trying to read only ""productive"" books. By month 6, **I was forcing myself through business and self-improvement titles that felt like homework. Variety is crucial for sustained reading.**

Digital-only reading. I'm a tech person, so I started with just Kindle and reading apps on my phone. While convenient, I found myself getting distracted by notifications and other apps. Physical books kept me focused longer.

What ACTUALLY worked:

The 25% rule. If I wasn't engaged after 25% of any book, I'd quit and move on. This single rule increased my completion rate dramatically. Life's too short for boring books.

Mixed format approach

* Physical books for deep focus sessions
* Audiobooks for commutes and walks
* E-books (iOS Kindle app) for travel
* Summary apps only for books I'd already read to review key points

Genre rotation system. I alternated between fiction, non-fiction, biography, and self-improvement books. This kept reading fresh and prevented burnout from any single category.

Note-taking apps integration. I used Obsidian (available on both Android and iOS) to create connected notes between books. Linking ideas across different books created deeper understanding than reading in isolation.

Morning reading ritual. 30-45 minutes every morning with coffee before checking any apps or social media. This became a sacred time that I protected fiercely.

Podcasts as book replacements. I love podcasts and using them as content was pretty good. I especially liked it when people talked about their experience on how they applied the book.

Podcast supplementation (the right way). Instead of replacing books with podcasts, I found podcasts where authors discussed their books in detail. This reinforced learning without replacing the deep reading experience.

Reading 40+ books taught me that the goal isn't consuming more content it's building a better thinking system. The best self-improvement comes from deeply understanding fewer ideas rather than superficially knowing many. It's better to read 10 good books again and again than to read 100 books without understanding any of its principles.

For anyone starting their reading journey: **Forget the apps promising shortcuts. Get comfortable books in whatever format works for you, quit the boring ones ruthlessly, and focus on understanding over speed.**

1p8gjxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/1p8gjxr/why_are_we_still_talking_about_epstein_when/,Why are we still talking about Epstein when voters care about economic issues?,"I keep hearing this talking point recently from otherwise credible journalists—like Batya Ungar Sargon—attempting to put an intellectual fire blanket on the story. “Like, who cares, man” is basically the argument, riding off of the partially true ethos of Deciding To Win. They use polling data with a confirmation bias to intellectually launder certain narratives.

#TLDR—the reason why cost of living is inflated is because politicians are blackmailed by a mafia.

The Epstein scandal represents the *methodology* of this blackmail. They vote in favor of inflationary fiscal, industrial and foreign policy because they are being blackmailed. Expose the blackmail methodology, then, we can elect politicians who promote economic prosperity. Epstein and the economy are the same issue.

So allow me to move the goalpost back to where it began:

According to Elon Musk, Trump chickened out of the DOGE mission to lower federal debt and began the inflationary OBBA because he’s compromised in the Epstein files. He campaigned on continuing the bipartisan protectionism where we bring back factories to America, create industrial jobs, prioritize American workers and students first, lower government spending and debt, opening up federal lands for housing. Then, he flip flopped, offering 50 year mortgages, bringing in 600k Chinese student spies, increasing debt and inflation, starting a war with Iran, even walking back deporting illegal aliens because it’s bad for corporate farming business. This complete 180 prompted Musk to accuse Trump of the “TACO” narrative. His own MAGA base split, accusing him of becoming MIGA. Polls show a 63% chance of a blue house in the 2026 midterms. MTG was just the canary in the coal mine.

Gee, what would motivate somebody to flip flop like that, despite creating their brand on protectionism, tariffs, freedom and economic populism? Somebody with an ego like Trump wouldn’t just 180 like that because it’s not in their character. We know his character. People like Trump care deeply about their image and brand. So, logically, we can induce that there is a bigger issue at stake with his brand. What is worse than flip flopping on issues? Being compromised by Netanyahu via Epstein. Blowing Bubba. That’s the optics of his flip flop: he betrayed his economic focus on protectionism because Netanyahu blackmailed him.

Historically, we know that Netanyahu blackmailed president Clinton. That is a historical fact. And what did he do? Offshore jobs to China and laid the groundwork for them to join the WTO. While he was covering up the Lewinsky scandal, they ignored Bin Laden, leading to 9/11 and the subsequent wars. One could argue that the Iraq war was caused by Netanyahu blackmailing president Clinton.

But it’s not just Clinton.

There are 1,000 Epstein victims. But it’s not just sexual crimes because the legacy of the Epstein scandal is sadly worse than a sex blackmail ring. It’s much worse than that. He was an Iran contra gun runner, money launderer, geopolitical operative and Mossad asset. Politicians go to Washington, get compromised, then, vote against their constituent interests, inflating the cost of living, offshoring jobs overseas, replacing American workers and supporting corporate serfdom. Bribes don’t work on everyone, so the Epstein mafia will threaten violence against their family, ensnare politicians in a sex scandal, frame them for treason, create a fake news narrative just to subvert the democratic function of politicians. That’s the Epstein scandal: disenfranchisement.

#We don’t own our own politicians.

My family survived an assassination attempt in 1997 after my father possessed the Lewinsky tapes as Linda Tripp’s attorney. Then, my father became a schlomo patsy who worked for a different Iran Contra gun runner. Look at JFK, RFK, MLK, Charlie Kirk, Melissa Hortman. Then, they point to you and say “you’re next” and force you to resign. Don Bacon, Thom Tillis, Thomas Massie, Marjorie Taylor Greene—they were forced into resignation or threatened with AIPAC primary challengers this year. We can only speculate what happened, but there is an unfortunate optic of coercion. In the case of MTG, she pushed the Epstein case so hard, fighting for its release when nobody else did, that Trump subtly encouraged violence against her, gaslit her, then encouraged violence against democrats, accusing them of treason. They all received numerous death threats because Trump canceled them. That’s what we’re dealing with. If you vote against the mafia—they use the treason narrative to create a pretext for a patsy to assassinate you.

So they resigned under duress like my father did.

During the 2016 debates, Megan Kelly was preparing a question about the way Trump treats woman. Somebody at Fox leaked it to him. Then, the day of the debate, a driver insists that Kelly accept a coffee. 15 minutes later, she is extremely sick. Was she poisoned? Now in 2025, she splits hairs between hebephelia and pedophelia as if to soften the blow of the inevitable story… did they get to her and flip her? Was that scripted?

So if we expose Epstein, we expose corruption. That will usher in a new wave of Gen X/Y/Z politicians to solve these economic issues. It’s that simple:

#Epstein is the methodology; inflation is the outcome.

- The same people trying say Epstein *is* a hoax that distracts us from economic issues will turn around and offer you a 50-year mortgage and corporate serfdom.

- The same people trying to say Epstein *is not* a hoax will turn around and say that offer solutions to fix the federal debt, inflation, factory jobs and middle class affordability.

Edge just introduced *Copilot Mode* — a built-in AI that can read all your tabs, summarize them, and even complete online tasks automatically.

Think of it as a personal assistant that never gets tired, never loses focus, and works right inside your browser.

And the best part?  
You control it completely.  
You turn it on, you turn it off, and it always tells you when it’s working.

This isn’t passive AI.  
This is active intelligence built into the way you browse.



# 💡 What the Microsoft Edge AI Agent Actually Does

Let’s break this down.

When you activate **Copilot Mode**, Edge becomes your AI research assistant.  
It can:

* Read up to **30 tabs** at once.
* Summarize everything into one clean answer.
* Automate repetitive tasks like form-filling, unsubscribing, or comparing products.
* Summarize long YouTube videos into quick takeaways.
* Organize your browsing history into “journeys” — grouped by topic.

Imagine telling your browser:  
“Compare these 10 articles and tell me the best option.”  
Or, “Find that marketing tools page I read last week.”

And it just… does it.

That’s the **Microsoft Edge AI Agent** — a browser that finally *works with you,* not against you.



# 🧠 Multi-Tab Reasoning: Edge’s Superpower

Let’s talk about the real game changer — **multi-tab reasoning.**

If you’ve ever had 20+ tabs open, trying to do research or compare options, you know the chaos.  
Now imagine this:

You ask Edge,  
“Which of these options is best based on all the tabs I have open?”

And the **Microsoft Edge AI Agent** reads all 30 tabs — web pages, PDFs, even internal company files — and gives you a *single, clear summary.*

No jumping between tabs.  
No mental overload.  
Just answers.

That’s a massive leap in productivity.  
And for researchers, entrepreneurs, or anyone who lives online — this is gold.



# 🧩 Agent Mode: Your Browser, Upgraded to an Assistant

Here’s where it gets insane.

The **Microsoft Edge AI Agent** now includes **Agent Mode** — a system that can complete online tasks for you, step-by-step.

Unsubscribing from newsletters.  
Filling out online forms.  
Comparing products across websites.  
Booking appointments.

All done automatically.

You just tell it what you want — and it executes each step safely, with your approval.

And before you panic about security — Microsoft built strict limits.  
Agent Mode only works on **IT-approved sites**, and it pauses instantly on any page with sensitive data like passwords or payment info.

You’re always in control.  
It’s AI assistance, not AI chaos.



# 🔒 Built with Privacy and Security in Mind

Microsoft knows trust is everything.

That’s why the **Microsoft Edge AI Agent** runs on enterprise-level controls.  
You decide when it can read data.  
You decide if it can access your history.  
And you can stop it anytime.

If your company has compliance rules, it respects them.  
If it hits a secure page, it pauses.

It even has **local AI protection** against fake pop-ups and scam sites that try to trick you.

This isn’t just clever — it’s safe.  
And that’s why businesses can actually use it without freaking out IT.



# 🧭 Journeys: Your Smart Memory Inside Edge

Ever tried finding that one site you visited two weeks ago?  
You know it exists… but it’s buried deep in your history.

That’s where **Journeys** comes in.

The **Microsoft Edge AI Agent** organizes your browsing history into projects or topics.  
If you were researching “AI marketing tools” last week, it remembers all those pages and brings them back instantly.

No manual searching.  
No lost progress.

You just pick up right where you left off.

It’s like Edge finally developed a memory — one that’s private, useful, and completely under your control.



# 🎥 Video Summarization: Save Hours Instantly

This one blew my mind.

The **Microsoft Edge AI Agent** can now summarize YouTube videos.  
You don’t have to sit through a 20-minute tutorial anymore.

Just ask:  
“Summarize this video.”

Copilot instantly gives you key takeaways, timestamps, and bullet-point summaries.  
Perfect for research, learning, or product reviews.

If you’re watching five different videos, it can tell you which one’s worth your time — before you even hit play.

That’s not just smart.  
That’s time freedom.



# 🌐 Intelligent New Tab & Daily Briefing

Microsoft even redesigned the **new tab experience**.

Now, when you open a new tab, you get an **intelligent command box** that does search, chat, and navigation all in one.  
It gives you personalized prompts — anticipating what you might need next.

Then there’s **Daily Briefing**.

Every morning, the **Microsoft Edge AI Agent** checks your tasks, calendar, and recent activity.  
It gives you a short summary: your meetings, deadlines, links, and top priorities for the day.

It’s like your morning coffee — but smarter.



# ⚙️ Built for Business, Not Just Browsing

This is what makes the **Microsoft Edge AI Agent** special — it’s enterprise-ready.

Microsoft didn’t just build a fun feature for casual users.  
They built a serious AI assistant for professionals.

You can use it safely in work environments, with all the data and compliance guardrails built in.  
And if you’ve got a Microsoft 365 license, you unlock even more features like full **Agent Mode** and **Daily Briefing.**

This isn’t just an AI gimmick — it’s a productivity tool made for scaling teams.



# 🔍 The Real Reason This Matters

Here’s the truth:

The **Microsoft Edge AI Agent** isn’t just about saving time.  
It’s about upgrading how we think, research, and work online.

Instead of fighting your browser, you’re now *collaborating* with it.

And that’s massive — especially for creators, marketers, and founders who live in the browser all day.

You get context-aware assistance, faster research, cleaner focus, and less burnout.

That’s how you scale — with leverage, not hustle.



# 🚀 How to Use This to Grow Your Business

It’s the future of how we work online.

You’re operating alongside an AI that reads, learns, and acts with you.

This is what browsing looks like when it finally gets smart.

And if you’re not using it yet, you’re leaving productivity on the table.

I mentioned before that I believed he cheated on me , the guy who ignored sex with me for *three weeks*, refused to show me his apps for two days, and wouldn’t even let me see his Google searches. All while knowing he has a history with escorts, sex cams, and picking up random girls online to go out drinking and partying with until late at night and have fun or sex . Yeah… that guy.

Today he suddenly contacts me saying it was “all a misunderstanding,” that we should talk, that he “loves me,” and that he would talk to me right after he finished work.

Guess what? He finishes work… and immediately gets “busy” again. Says his friend is at the coffee shop with him. Fine. I tell him I’ll wait. Then he goes to the friend’s house. And just like that contact cut. Ghosted for hours. No response. Nothing.

Why would you contact me saying you’re sorry, swear you didn’t cheat, talk about how you want to fix things… only to ghost me for hours *again* and basically confirm everything I was worried about?

And the worst part? I’m sitting here crying as I’m writing this. I feel humiliated all over again, like I let myself believe someone who never intended to treat me with respect in the first place and cheat on me again tonight. I'm sure he went to drink with other girls he talks to in the apps he refused to show me and have sex. Also I forgot to mention, he always replied late to me when we were together. 

I'm ending whatever I had with him. He has reddit so he probably will see this. I will not forgive you w 7asbial fik.

1p8gfc8,https://x.com/bungarsargon/status/1992586223358210349?s=46,Batya attempts to put a fire blanket on Epstein story,"I keep hearing this talking point recently from otherwise credible journalists—like Batya Ungar Sargon—attempting to put an intellectual fire blanket on the story. “Like, who cares, man” is basically the argument, riding off of the partially true ethos of Deciding To Win. They use polling data with a confirmation bias to intellectually launder this narrative that Epstein and protectionism aren’t related to bread and butter economic issues.

#TLDR—the reason why cost of living is inflated is because politicians are blackmailed by a mafia.

The Epstein scandal represents the *methodology* of this blackmail. They vote in favor of inflationary fiscal, industrial and foreign policy because they are being blackmailed. Expose the blackmail methodology, then, we can elect politicians who promote economic prosperity. Epstein and the economy are the same issue.

So allow me to move the goalpost back to where it began:

According to Elon Musk, Trump chickened out of the DOGE mission to lower federal debt and began the inflationary OBBA because he’s compromised in the Epstein files. He campaigned on continuing the bipartisan protectionism where we bring back factories to America, create industrial jobs, prioritize American workers and students first, lower government spending and debt, opening up federal lands for housing. Then, he flip flopped, offering 50 year mortgages, bringing in 600k Chinese student spies, increasing debt and inflation, starting a war with Iran, even walking back deporting illegal aliens because it’s bad for corporate farming business. This complete 180 prompted Musk to accuse Trump of the “TACO” narrative. His own MAGA base split, accusing him of becoming MIGA. Polls show a 63% chance of a blue house in the 2026 midterms. MTG was just the canary in the coal mine.

Gee, what would motivate somebody to flip flop like that, despite creating their brand on protectionism, tariffs, freedom and economic populism? Somebody with an ego like Trump wouldn’t just 180 like that because it’s not in their character. We know his character. People like Trump care deeply about their image and brand. So, logically, we can induce that there is a bigger issue at stake with his brand. What is worse than flip flopping on issues? Being compromised by Netanyahu via Epstein. Blowing Bubba. That’s the optics of his flip flop: he betrayed his economic focus on protectionism because Netanyahu blackmailed him.

Historically, we know that Netanyahu blackmailed president Clinton. That is a historical fact. And what did he do? Offshore jobs to China and laid the groundwork for them to join the WTO. While he was covering up the Lewinsky scandal, they ignored Bin Laden, leading to 9/11 and the subsequent wars. One could argue that the Iraq war was caused by Netanyahu blackmailing president Clinton.

But it’s not just Clinton.

There are 1,000 Epstein victims. But it’s not just sexual crimes because the legacy of the Epstein scandal is sadly worse than a sex blackmail ring. It’s much worse than that. He was an Iran contra gun runner, money launderer, geopolitical operative and Mossad asset. Politicians go to Washington, get compromised, then, vote against their constituent interests, inflating the cost of living, offshoring jobs overseas, replacing American workers and supporting corporate serfdom. Bribes don’t work on everyone, so the Epstein mafia will threaten violence against their family, ensnare politicians in a sex scandal, frame them for treason, create a fake news narrative just to subvert the democratic function of politicians. That’s the Epstein scandal: disenfranchisement.

#We don’t own our own politicians.

My family survived an assassination attempt in 1997 after my father possessed the Lewinsky tapes as Linda Tripp’s attorney. Then, my father became a schlomo patsy who worked for a different Iran Contra gun runner. Look at JFK, RFK, MLK, Charlie Kirk, Melissa Hortman. Then, they point to you and say “you’re next” and force you to resign. Don Bacon, Thom Tillis, Thomas Massie, Marjorie Taylor Greene—they were forced into resignation or threatened with AIPAC primary challengers this year. We can only speculate what happened, but there is an unfortunate optic of coercion. In the case of MTG, she pushed the Epstein case so hard, fighting for its release when nobody else did, that Trump subtly encouraged violence against her, gaslit her, then encouraged violence against democrats, accusing them of treason. They all received numerous death threats because Trump canceled them. That’s what we’re dealing with. If you vote against the mafia—they use the treason narrative to create a pretext for a patsy to assassinate you.

So they resigned under duress like my father did.

During the 2016 debates, Megan Kelly was preparing a question about the way Trump treats woman. Somebody at Fox leaked it to him. Then, the day of the debate, a driver insists that Kelly accept a coffee. 15 minutes later, she is extremely sick. Was she poisoned? Now in 2025, she splits hairs between hebephelia and pedophelia as if to soften the blow of the inevitable story… did they get to her and flip her? Was that scripted?

So if we expose Epstein, we expose corruption. That will usher in a new wave of Gen X/Y/Z politicians to solve these economic issues. It’s that simple:

#Epstein is the methodology; inflation is the outcome.

- The same people trying say Epstein *is* a hoax that distracts us from economic issues will turn around and offer you a 50-year mortgage and corporate serfdom.

- The same people trying to say Epstein *is not* a hoax will turn around and say that offer solutions to fix the federal debt, inflation, factory jobs and middle class affordability.

I (30, F) work in a small office of mostly women. I have somewhat befriended one that I've known for about 4 years now. We have a new hire that came on board earlier this year that works closely with her. The ""friend"" of mine shared some odd comments the new person has stated when she came on board that were offputting, but as I got to know her, I got the sense that maybe she was lying, or misconstrued what she said. 

  
Yesterday, I had a long phone conversation with the ""friend"" and apparently the new person has continued with the same cynical comments, as well as judgmental ones about everyone in the office, but now some about me. She didn't share everything, but warned me not to sit with her at the company party because the newbie mentioned she didn't want me to ""cling"" to her (as if I'm one to have ever done that?? WTF). I was so mad after the phone call because I have gotten to know the new person over lunch/coffee a few times and felt like we surprisingly had a lot of things in common and were forming a friendship. I feel like I read people well if they're genuine/fake and never noticed any weird vibes from her. She is always the one to initiate our conversations when I see her around. The thought that she possibly would take that as me being clingy maddens me, because I'm typically the opposite at work. 

I don't see what reason my friend would have to lie to me, but now I don't know what to believe. Although I wasn't told directly by the new person (if that's how she feels), I want to confront her but also don't want to make it known that that was shared with me.

If you’ve ever tried to juggle school schedules, therapy appointments, meltdowns, homework, meals, and a service animal who also needs structure… then you’ll understand why I practically live by my color-coded calendar and coffee.

A lot of people ask what our days really look like. They picture a perfectly trained service dog, a child who calmly transitions through routines, and me somehow gliding through the day like Mary Poppins.  
Let me just say—**that’s not our life**. At all.

So here’s what a typical day looks like for us, in all its messy, beautiful, exhausting, and joyful glory.

# Mornings: Where We Hope for Smooth, But Expect Chaos

Our mornings always start with the familiar sound of paws stretching on the bedroom carpet. Our service dog is always the first one awake—ready to work, ready to help, and prepared to alert if needed. Meanwhile, I’m over here trying to convince myself that yes, it’s time to get out of bed.

The first challenge of the day is transitions.  
Getting dressed. Brushing teeth. Putting shoes on the right feet.  
If you know, you know.

This is where our service dog shines.  
Deep-pressure therapy during an early morning sensory overload?  
He’s on it.  
Leading my son gently toward his backpack when he stalls?  
He’s got it.  
Interrupting anxious behaviors when the morning feels too rushed?  
Yep—he does that too.

But even with the help, mornings are… a lot. Some days we’re on time. Some days we’re “this counts as present, right?” late. And that’s okay.

# School Time: Where I Hold My Breath a Little

Drop-off is the hardest part of the day—for all of us.

I watch my son walk in with his service dog at his side, both of them working as a team. My heart swells with pride, but my stomach always does that nervous little flip. Will today be a good day? Will the noise be too much? Will transitions overwhelm him? Will the service dog need to step in more than usual?

Then I sit in the car for a minute, take a deep breath, and mentally prepare myself for whatever call or message might come from school. Some days are quiet. Some days are not.

And on the good days?  
I celebrate like we just won an Olympic event.

# Afternoons: Therapy, Homework… and Trying Not to Fall Apart

After school, there’s usually therapy—sometimes occupational, sometimes speech, sometimes both. My son works hard. His service animal works hard. And honestly, I do too.

Therapy days feel long, but they also feel hopeful—every small win matters. Every new skill is something worth celebrating. Some days, he comes out smiling. Other days, he comes out drained. His service dog is usually the one who notices the shift first.

Once we’re home, it’s homework time… or what I like to call.  
“The hour of negotiations.”  
Here again, our service dog plays a huge role—providing grounding, companionship, and comfort when frustration hits.

# Evenings: Our Version of Peace

Evenings are calmer in our house. Dinner together. A little playtime. A walk if the weather is good. And always—always—some cuddle time between my son and his service dog. It’s their shared moment to reset after a long day.

Bedtime is a process. And on the nights where his service dog curls up beside him and he falls asleep without a fight, I silently thank the universe.

# And That’s Our Life—A Balance of Busy, Beautiful, and Brave

Our days aren’t perfect. They aren’t always smooth. And yes, sometimes they feel like a marathon with no finish line in sight. But they’re ours-made easier, softer, and safer because of the bond between my son and his service dog. We face each day with resilience, finding beauty in the chaos and strength in our struggles.

But they’re *ours*—made easier, softer, and safer because of the bond between my son and his service dog.

We don’t always get things right.  
We don’t always stay on schedule.  
And we don’t always stay calm.

But we keep going.  
We laugh a lot. Our home is filled with joy and laughter, even in the midst of our challenges. We find humor in the everyday moments, and it’s these shared smiles that keep us connected and strong.  
We learn more than most families ever have to. Each day brings new lessons, new perspectives, and new understandings. We’re constantly growing and evolving, and it’s this journey of learning that makes our family unique and empathetic.

I’ve recently started seeing this guy I met on hinge and we’ve been hitting it off. We met for coffee and hung out for a few hours afterwards; it was great. We started texting a lot after that but I haven’t heard from him in about 48 hours which hasn’t happened since we were using hinge to talk. I’ve just been assuming that since it’s thanksgiving, he’s been preoccupied which is totally okay. I sent him a little happy thanksgiving text this morning and don’t expect him to get back to me for a bit, but I’m starting to get a little anxious. The last time something like this happened, it ended up with me getting stood up on a date (I was the one who was asked out so it extra hurt), and I can’t help but feel like it’s gonna happen again. I talked to a friend about it, and she said I’m overreacting and that this is just how dating is but we had the exact same conversation when I got stood up. I have a date planned with this guy for Sunday which gives him a lot of time to text me, so I’m doing my best to stay calm and not think too much about it, but there’s that little voice in the back of my head saying that I’m gonna get stood up again. I feel a little insane, I’m not gonna lie. Please be kind, I just really don’t want to have go through being ghosted like that again.

Smear it on your face;

See the shining head,

Crying, unready,

Rip it out.

Let the sun’s love refract, dazzle

Blind, obscure their sight 

So they see your crystal righteous

And not a wedge of darkness.

Hold your crystal aloft 

Like Excalibur to the sky;

May the sun’s hatred scorch

To invigorate your cells 

And gold-plate your tongue.

1p8fx21,https://www.reddit.com/r/thanksgiving/comments/1p8fx21/thanksgiving_2025/,Thanksgiving 2025,"I was so excited when my 32 year old bipolar son said he would be coming home for Thanksgiving. I cleaned his childhood bedroom, put clean sheets on his bed, washed all his blankets and put an electric blanket on his bed. I then did all of the laundry that he had left in his childhood bathroom the last time he came to visit. It took me many hours. When I sent him a text message to tell him I had done these things for him, he messaged me back a check mark. I was hoping for ""Thanks Mom! I love you."" I did not let him know how disappointed I was. I was still so happy that he was going to spend Thanksgiving with me.

I raised him as a single Mom with little help from anyone. I worked several jobs to pay for all of his childhood enrichment activities, sports, and tutors. He joined a water polo team in high school since he was a very good swimmer. I went to 95% of his games even though I worked full time. He wanted to play water polo in college and I wanted him to be happy so I paid over $200,000 to send him to the college he wanted to go to most. He played NCAA college water polo. The college was 4 hours away and the games were sometimes even farther away than that. Still, I went to 80% of his college games, sometimes staying in hotels so I could attend them.

Since it made little sense to me to spend all day cooking for 2 people, I decided to order carry-out Thanksgiving. I ordered it from a very fancy restaurant that has an excellent chef. Everything came precooked and came with instructions on how to heat it up. The heating up time took 1.5 hours. I got up early, watched the Macy's day parade, enjoyed a wonderful coffee, and spent the day looking forward to a wonderful meal with my son. He had said he wanted to eat at 5pm. At 1pm, I went to the grocery store to buy some whipped cream for the pumpkin pie. I also bought vanilla ice cream in case he preferred that to whipped cream. I spent the afternoon cleaning the house to make it even nicer. I lit a wonderful smelling candle to create atmosphere.

At 4pm, I still had not seen him all day. He never came out of his bedroom. I started sending him text messages at 4pm asking if he still wanted to eat at 5pm. I received no answer. Finally at 5pm, I started the oven to heat up the amazing food I had purchased. I kept hoping my son would emerge from his bedroom. At 6pm, I realized that the chances were slim that that was going to happen.

Finally, at 6:30pm it became clear that he was going to be absent. I decided I would enjoy Thanksgiving instead with my 2 dogs. I hadn't fed them all day because I had planned to share some turkey with them. I love my 2 dogs and they show up and are always there for me. My bipolar breaks my heart time and time again, yet still I always hope that he will show up. This is not the first Thanksgiving where he has not shown up. But I thought it would be different.

Like a foolish child, I always believe that he will not continue to disappoint me. I'm 64 years old. I am forever hopeful even though I know better. I enjoyed the turkey with my 2 dogs. I don't know why my son bothered to come here. He lives 1.5 hours away. Here is a photo of the Thanksgiving table that no one ever sat at. I don't understand the world of bipolar disorder where you love someone so much and would do anything for them, but you will never matter to them. It is my world that I live in and re-live the disappointment continuously. From Sad Mom.

Here is what actually worked for me.","In the past 6 months, I have felt the most ""normal"" I have in a very long time. I have struggled with Panic Attacks and Agoraphobia for around 18 years, but recently I’ve been living and enjoying life again.

My recovery came down to a mix of medication and finally learning to truly accept the anxiety and sit with it. I know that sounds like the same cliché advice you’ve read a thousand times and ignored hoping for a quick fix. I ignored it too. But it turns out, the ""rubbish"" advice is actually the answer.

I wanted to post this to tell you that the methods you read about in Claire Weekes’ books or *Dare* by Barry McDonagh really do work. You have taught your brain to avoid things because they feel scary; you need to teach it that they are not as dangerous as your brain remembers. Avoidance is the enemy here.

At my worst, I couldn't go to the small shop at the end of my street without a panic attack. I couldn't see friends. I became housebound for about a year.

**How I started getting better:** I made a list in my phone notes of things I missed (swimming, steam rooms, dinner with friends) and things I avoided (public transport, haircuts, basically anything I couldn't easily escape from).

I was determined to tick them off, but I had to break them into tiny chunks. For example, with trains:

1. Go to the station and just sit on the platform (didn't get on).
2. Get on, do one stop, and walk home.

It sounds crazy to a ""normal"" person, but it really helped. You have to work toward the things you miss the most. The only thing left on my list is a flight. The idea of being ""trapped"" in a seat until landing terrifies me, but I’ve booked a surprise trip for my partner next year. Wish me luck.

**The turning point:** When I started picking up the pace, I actually built a simple little app for myself to track my exposure list and my daily habits. Seeing the data changed everything. I realised that specific things were killing my progress (weekend beers, doom scrolling/bad sleep) and other things were like natural Valium (one coffee limit, weightlifting, and hot-to-cold therapy like saunas/cold showers).

Everyone is different though, I tried running and yet to find that ""runner's high"". You have to find your own formula.

I honestly don't hate anything as much as panic attacks; they robbed me of so many good memories. I hope this post helps someone get their life back faster than I did.

I also think that's what I have realised today, my ED loves to make plans - plan nice food, plan to eat more, plan to challenge myself but then I come to actually do it and it is always I will try again tomorrow - Groundhog Day like one of you commented and it is true. So going forward, having a plan *definitely* helps but I just need to be aware these plans shouldn't be edited and fixed all day, nearly like a hobby. I make a plan and follow it! 

I also keep asking ChatGPT for advice on energy, and no surprise it gives a different answer every time lol. But I then bounce from feeling like 2600 is too much to then convincing myself it isn't enough to weight restore, but I mostly feel it is far too much if I am honest and ChatGPT just can't decide!! I wish I could just not care about energy, but I fear the reality is, if I start to 'not care' I just let my brain run free and convince myself I am eating far more than I am. I do think though following the meal plan structure (3 meals and 3 snacks and a double dessert) is key and not getting majorly obsessed with energy. This is what I agreed with my dietician last week - two snacks in the afternoon and one in the evening (supper) and then a two part dessert for example ice cream come and chocolate (or one bigger dessert - cake and custard). But bottom line making sure my meals and snacks are actually sufficient to meet 2600. When I type it out like this it is actually pretty simple - 3 meals, 3 snacks, double dessert, 2600. 

I just so wish my brain would let me do it. It would let me meet my energy and have portions that make my food enjoyable. Like today I let myself add sugar to my afternoon coffee and it made the snack SO much better and a proper portion of cheese made my dinner so much better. But that's it, I have an ED it isn't just going to let me one day, I have to fight it everyday and push myself to get there. One day I will, I know I will.

Hey guys, I already made a post regarding this a few days back and I ended up confronting her and it turned into a disaster.

So I have a roommate who is currently on her period and two days back she literally shouted out loud during her period (she has pcos), slammed the doors, and broke a coffee mug in the pain she is facing. I understand how pcos can cause really painful cramps and how it can be unbearable. I offered her painkillers and in the end, I had to end up leaving the house because what she was doing was unbearable. 

I am in a shared living situation where we live in the living room. We are broke and neither of us can afford to stay in a room so this is our living situation. 

She is generally very noisy, sleeps in late, keeps music in speaker on her phone and laptop even past 12am, doesn’t reduce the volume even after asking so many times. I have been sleep deprived since the past few months and this really got me off. This has been happening every month and whenever she’s on a period it’s a nightmare for me. She keeps moaning out loud in the middle of the night, banging stuff trying to take tablets, and I am so tired of this. I cannot get the sympathy for her now because I am feeling anxious all the time, my head keeps spinning, i am on edge all the time due to the lack of sleep and its affecting my routine all the time. 

Today, it finally got out and we had a huge argument and I said while I can understand that shes in pain, it’s causing such a huge disturbance to everyone (especially since yesterday my roommate had to leave the room and GO OUTSIDE to take a work call) and she needs to do something to control herself. She says its only one day in a month so we should be fine with it and how shes fine the rest of the days. I said thats not fair. And it now turned into her yelling at me saying even she has cramps she’s gonna go to work all during her cycle. I am just wondering if I seemed inconsiderate about her feelings and if I am wrong on my part? It just hit the extreme day before yesterday, usually I don’t say anything but i’m just done and I had to say something.",31,1764284327.0,AITAH,44,0.82,False
