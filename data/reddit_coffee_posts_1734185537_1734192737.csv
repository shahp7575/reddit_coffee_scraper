I'm looking for advice on how to optimize my performance during my upcoming week of law exams. I’ll be writing exams every day from 9 AM to 2 PM, and I need to be as focused and sharp as possible during this time.

For some context, I take Elvanse (lisdexamfetamine) to support my concentration. I’m wondering when would be the best time to take it each morning for maximum effectiveness during the exam period.

I’d love to hear your perspective! I’m not looking for a generic ""everyone is different"" answer but actionable advice based on your experiences or insights. How did you suceed, what did you do for optimum concentration?

* **Breakfast options:** What should I eat (or avoid) to sustain energy and focus for five straight hours of writing?
* **Morning routines:** Sport before exam?
* **Supplements:** Are there any specific supplements (e.g., magnesium, omega-3, or anything else) that you’ve found helpful during intense focus periods?
* **Hydration:** What’s the best way to manage fluid intake? Should I sip water consistently, or is something like an electrolyte drink better?
* **Snacks during exams:** What snacks are ideal to bring that are quick, easy, and won’t cause a sugar crash?
* **Caffeine:** Would you recommend coffee, green tea, or skipping caffeine altogether for better focus and stability?

Thanks so much for your help! This week is incredibly important for me, and I want to feel as prepared and sharp as I can. 😊",1,1734192392.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False
1he5zvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllAboutKeto/comments/1he5zvl/all_about_keto_a_guide_to_the_ketogenic_lifestyle/,All About Keto: A Guide to the Ketogenic Lifestyle,"The ketogenic diet, commonly known as keto, has gained immense popularity for its potential to support weight loss, improve mental clarity, and boost energy levels. By drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and increasing healthy fat consumption, keto encourages your body to enter a state called ketosis, where fat becomes the primary energy source. Here’s everything you need to know to get started and make the most of this transformative diet.

What is the Keto Diet?

The keto diet focuses on macronutrient ratios that promote ketosis:

* 70-80% Fats: Healthy fats like avocado, olive oil, butter, and coconut oil are staples.
* 20-25% Protein: Moderate protein sources like chicken, fish, and eggs.
* 5-10% Carbohydrates: Low-carb vegetables like leafy greens, broccoli, and zucchini replace traditional carb-heavy foods like bread and pasta.
* In ketosis, your body efficiently burns fat for fuel, producing ketones that enhance energy and brain function.

Benefits of the Keto Diet

1. Weight Loss: By reducing carb intake, your body relies on stored fat for energy.

2. Enhanced Mental Clarity: Ketones are a clean energy source for the brain, leading to better focus.

3. Improved Energy Levels: With stable blood sugar levels, energy remains consistent throughout the day.

4. Better Blood Sugar Control: Ideal for individuals managing Type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance.

 Keto-Friendly Foods to Include

*  Fats: Avocado, butter, coconut oil, MCT oil, olive oil.
*  Proteins: Eggs, chicken, beef, fish, tofu.
*  Low-Carb Vegetables: Spinach, kale, zucchini, cauliflower.
*  Snacks: Cheese, nuts, and seeds.
*  Keto Treats: Dark chocolate (sugar-free), keto fat bombs.

 Two Must-Have Products for Keto Success

1. MCT Oil:

[MCT (Medium Chain Triglycerides) oi](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=MCT+%28Medium+Chain+Triglycerides%29&crid=3SBS0DDQR6PZS&sprefix=mct+medium+chain+triglycerides+%2Caps%2C363&linkCode=ll2&tag=worfrohom020-20&linkId=8cdd84f2ac24a31c265bd1d0ad805944&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)l is a fast-digesting fat that provides quick energy and supports ketosis. Add it to your morning coffee or smoothies to boost mental clarity and fat burning.

2. Digital Food Scale:

Portion control is key to staying within your daily macro goals. A [digital food scale ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=digital+food+scale&crid=2LSX7XQ9UKZMJ&sprefix=digital+food+scale%2Caps%2C553&linkCode=ll2&tag=worfrohom020-20&linkId=84af8bdfaeacbd7f7d1b27d1a3362a2f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)ensures accuracy when measuring ingredients and tracking carbs.

Sample One-Day Keto Meal Plan

Breakfast: Scrambled eggs with avocado and spinach cooked in butter.

Lunch: Grilled chicken salad with olive oil and lemon dressing.

Dinner: Baked salmon with roasted cauliflower and a creamy sauce.

Snack: Cheese cubes with a handful of almonds.

Tips for Starting Keto

1. Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water to combat dehydration and the ""keto flu.""

2. Replenish Electrolytes: Add salt to your meals and consider supplements for magnesium and potassium.

3. Track Macros: Use apps like MyFitnessPal or Carb Manager to ensure you’re hitting your targets.

4. Plan Meals Ahead: Meal prep saves time and keeps you on track.

The ketogenic diet is more than just a way to lose weight; it’s a lifestyle change that offers numerous health benefits. With the right mindset, tools, and knowledge, you can enjoy the journey to a healthier, more energetic you. Don’t forget to check out the recommended products to kickstart your keto success!

While insomnia scrambles my brain like a morning fry-up, my hometown plots to bury me and its secret alike.  
  
This is the first part of a trilogy and ongoing series, wrapping up the main story but leaving plot threads dangling for the future.\]

The gf and I decided to head into the CBD tonight, specifically Elizabeth Quay for the fireworks and then head for a later dinner afterwards. Following the fireworks, I was in dire need of a toilet. With the excessive amounts of people in the CBD for the Christmas lights mixed with the Elizabeth Quay fair and the fireworks, we'd automatically assume there would be ample public toilets available. This was not the case, or so not from what we could see from. Busting and hungry we decided to just head into the city in search for one. Went past a Macca's, their toilet queue was that of a standard Perf new coffee joint so just kept walking.

Also hungry, we just decided to just go to the bus station toilets on the way to Northbridge for a feed. As we went down the escalator, near the toilets at the end was the standard group of degenerates causing a ruckus with a transit guard next to them. GF decided to just sit down and wait for me near the front at the escalators where more people were sitting.

After I came out of the toilet, I seen 2 guys sitting down with 3 transit guards around them, my gf standing away looking shocked. 1 of those oxygen thieves decided to spit on my girlfriend as he walked past and mumbled something. Luckily there were transit guards to step in and my gf just wanted to hurry up and walk away. 

The whole situation has left her night ruined and shaken. It's left me angry but also hurts that I couldn't do anything at the time for her. I wasn't there for her in the moment and I blame myself for putting her in that situation which really I know the problem is actually the amount of sad excuses of men around that a woman can't even sit alone for a minute. Not even a uniform presence of transit guards mean anything. 

TL;DR - lack of public toilets in the CBD inadvertently led to my girlfriend being spat on by some lowlife scum. 

The state government really needs to do more to combat these issues especially if they want more people to visit the CBD. ",11,1734191442.0,perth,6,0.87,False

I’m planning to open an Indian bar in San Francisco, located on Columbus Ave. The concept combines Indian and US-inspired fusion food alongside a variety of beverages, including chai, coffee, and cold drinks.

Currently, I’m in the process of renting a space and budgeting for the necessary modifications, equipment, supplies, permits, and wages for a team of five. After some initial projections, I’ve estimated first-year expenses to be approximately **$1.2 million**.

While I understand my data is preliminary and not highly detailed, I’d greatly appreciate your perspective on this forecast. Does $1.2 million seem realistic for such an endeavor? In your experience or understanding of similar ventures, what would you consider a **reasonable minimum and maximum range** for costs in the first year?

Thank you in advance to anyone willing to share insights!",0,1734191203.0,barista,0,0.33,False

I was picking up some donuts and coffee for a company party. We ordered 2 big boxes of 44oz coffee. That girl was getting the coffee ready, but the cardboard box broke, so I helped her to pour the coffee into a different box. As I was assisting her, she said, “your cologne smells really nice!” Other girls who worked in the shop commented, “did she just say that!?” 
Well, I said, “thank you!”

Well, I went back there again this morning. She immediately noticed me and said, “were you here the other day? The whole coffee thing?” 
I:”yes. Were you the one commenting on my cologne?”
She: “yes.”
“It smells good, huh? Do you like it?”
“I do.”
“Are you always here in the morning?”
“Yes, except Sundays (that’s tomorrow, I think). “
“What’s your name?”
“Xxx”
“How old are you, xxx?”
“20, how old are you?”
“Guess”
“22?”
“Nope, 30.” I said it as I walked out because I’m in a hurry. 
Well, she looked at me as I exited the store. 
Of course, we maintained eye contact this entire time. 

Any thoughts?

I teach some industrial arts (mostly woodworking) in a middle school. I’m still a little green, but I have some students I’d like to do a special project with so I bought a live edge slab to make some coffee tables out of. It will still need some drying. 

My initial question is, does it make sense to chop this beast into the 2x 4’ pieces I want then sticker and stack to dry? Or should I dry the whole slab then cut? Slab is approximately 8’ x 18-22” x 3” thick. Also- if I’m planning on bow ties, should those go in before drying and flattening or after?

I’m sure I’ll have more questions as we go along.

People Watching is one of my favorite hobbies, so this would probably be my job of choice if I were Filipino... but I would probably really start to dislike foreigners tbh. 

The old foreigners talk your ear off about stuff you don't care about, the younger ones have a new girl you have to sign-in every few days/weeks/whatever, and you get ""nosebleed"" when you're forced to explain intricacies in English  (ex: the pool maintenance schedule, move-in clearance paperwork)

They've taught me a few of the cultural quirks in this country too... For example, one of them will walk by holding a mug and say ""coffee ser!""... At first, I thought they were asking me if I wanted one, so I said ""no thankyousir"" and he looked confused. I went back to the condo and explained this to my gf, she said he just wants me to be happy for him and say something like ""ENJOY sir!""  
  
So now, if they're eating in the guardhouse and they raise their plate of rice up to me and say ""Sir, eat!"" I say ""eat good na!"" and keep walking. 

I've also had one hit on my gf by the pool, I waited until nobody else was around and confronted him gently about this (I repeated what he said to my girlfriend in a Filipino accent) and he morphed into a dog staring at the floor after peeing all over the carpet after that... He was transferred soon after, I guess he knew that he would be leaving soon and he wanted to shoot his shot.

For some (stupid?) reason, the breakfast ends at 9 a.m.

I have JUST made it every morning. 

This morning (a Saturday!) I got there at 9 a.m. on the dot. 

The woman working in the kitchen YELLED at me about breakfast ending at 9, not 9:01 (in Spanish, I think I caught most of it). I looked at my phone (which is the accurate time because WiFi) and it was 9 a.m., not 9:01 a.m.

Also, I am allergic to eggs and I currently can't process dairy (which they know by now)... So they just give me a bun, some jam and some cut up fruit... They also sometimes fry me a couple of slices of plantains.

I debated leaving and just going somewhere to eat (I was planning to go to the market in any case). However, she told me to sit down. 

I couldn't have coffee because they already removed all the mugs (at or before exactly 9 a.m., evidently).

She brought breakfast out to an Asian couple and proceeded to lecture them about breakfast ending at 9 a.m. However, they were there before (probably slightly before) 9 a.m. It was pretty obvious that they didn't know any Spanish, so they kind of just looked at each other in a confused manner, she left and they shrugged their shoulders. 

Then, she brought my breakfast out... A bun, jam, a cup of fruit and two fried slices of plantains. If it was such a big deal, she could have skipped frying the plantains... Presumably the buns already exist and the fruit might even already be cut up (the amount of fruit they give you would have taken me less than a minute to cut, and I've never worked in a restaurant).

The Galapagos are supposed to be a holiday locale... I doubt anyone at my hotel is on business travel... There is an outdoor pool and hammocks. 

Also, the pool closes at 8 p.m., which seems crazy early to me. 

I am a digital nomad, and the only good internet is (oddly) in my bathroom and outside by the pool. The worst Internet is at my desk. They have been kind enough to let me stay by the pool to use the Internet until around 10 p.m.

The ad on Expedia said that the Internet could be wired in if necessary... I asked about that, they didn't know what that meant. 

It's awkward to impossible to have meetings and work in my bathroom.

I'm starting to wonder about changing to a different hotel. 

9 a.m. seems crazy early for breakfast, especially on the weekends, for a non-business traveller resort? 8 p.m. seems crazy early for a pool to close? 

I guess they think everyone sleeps from 9 p.m. until 7 a.m.?!",0,1734190743.0,hotels,18,0.23,False

Expats, Chime In!","The moment the cease-fire was signed, I opened the MEA app and booked my ticket to Beirut. Last year, I spent Christmas with my family in Lebanon before flying back abroad the next day. This year, my return marks exactly one year since I last set foot in my homeland.

Little did I know how much would change by the time I landed. Hassan Nasrallah is six feet under, Hezbollah is limping, and Bashar Al Assad is in exile. Yes the future looks uncertain and I have mixed feelings about it, but it just feels profoundly different this time.

Having lived abroad for most of my life, I’ve always felt a growing attachment to Lebanon despite the distance. But this time, returning feels unlike any other. For the first time, the feeling that my identity as a Lebanese is under threat has diminished. I feel less shame, more internal peace, and call me naive, genuine hope.

For the first time ever, I can envision a future where one day my ticket back to Lebanon would be one-way, carrying capital to invest in a business and settle down for good. Together, we could rebuild this traumatized nation brimming with untapped potential.

I can’t wait to land, hand my passport to Amn el Aam, and hear that familiar stamp hit the page and Hamdella 3al Salemeh. I can’t wait to be surrounded by my people on a night out, in coffee shops, speaking my native language and sharing my heritage.

I have avoided coffee because my stomach is pretty sensitive and so I have stuck to energy drinks. As I've been getting older I've been trying to look for a less sugary substitute, drinking essentially a soda every morning is more than likely taking a toll on my health.

This leads to my mission to find a low sugar substitute. Most of the low/no sugar substitutes contain aspertaine, stevia, sucralose or some other type of sugar substitute. They do not agree with me. I've had weird reactions to some and just plain can't stand the taste of others. I had in mind that I wanted something with sugar but just a reasonable amount. I looked high and low and there aren't many options out there. I found a few locally but they were pretty bland.

I saw a few old posts in this sub with people in search of something similar and I kept seeing Bing being mentioned (specifically the crisp apple flavor). I looked locally and went to multiple stores that were listed on the distributors website but I could not find them. I finally broke down and bought a case online.

This beverage is great! I love the flavor and I don't feel guilty about indulging. They have fully substituted my red bulls and I haven't noticed any difference in the amount of perceived ""energy"". They're a great kick start in the morning and though I've never had issues with crashes I'm sure this beverage would help alleviate that issue for those who do.

I wholeheartedly recommend bing to those who have issues with artificial sweeteners but are looking to reduce their sugar intake. Give it a try, I'm happy I found it. 🤙😎🤙",4,1734190547.0,energydrinks,0,0.83,False

I go to a naturopath for care, but things aren’t really helping. My stool test came back and the only thing my doctor addressed was the low amount of elastase-1, meaning my pancreas is not producing enough enzymes. So she just prescribed me ANOTHER supplement and sent me on my merry way. This same doctor also told me to follow a strict diet of gluten free, dairy free, no tomato, soy, corn, coffee. Which is fine, it’s just difficult being a broke college student and trying to navigate this diet. 

I’m feeling frustrated because my stool sample showed very high levels in other categories, that when I researched seemed concerning. And my doctor didn’t even bat an eye. For example: my Fusobacterium spp. levels were at 5.44, and a healthy amount is less than 1.008. I’m no doctor myself, but when I researched that, it’s not a good sign. Here is what I found online: “Fusobacterium spp. present in the oral and gut flora is carcinogenic and is associated with the risk of pancreatic and colorectal cancers.”

The rain pounded against the windows, a deafening roar that drowned out everything else. I sat in the dim kitchen, the flickering light above casting long shadows across the walls. My hands trembled, clutching the cup of lukewarm coffee I hadn’t touched. I stared into the dark liquid, the bitter taste of fear settling at the back of my throat.

She wasn’t my daughter. 

I kept telling myself that over and over, but every time I thought it, the words felt less and less like the truth.

It all started two weeks ago, when my wife, Lisa, brought her home from the hospital. She was just a baby, wrapped in a soft pink blanket, her face so tiny and delicate that I felt a surge of love the moment I held her. Her name was Emma—my daughter, my flesh and blood. I remember thinking I’d never felt more whole in my life.

But something was wrong. 

I couldn’t put my finger on it at first. She cried like any newborn would, and I comforted her like any father would. But then... it started.

I noticed it one night when she was about three days old. I was changing her, and I looked into her eyes. I know it sounds insane, but it wasn’t right. Her eyes—there was something off about them. They weren’t the soft, innocent blue I expected. They were dark, almost black, with a coldness that made my blood run cold.

I brushed it off. Maybe it was the exhaustion, or the strange light in the room. I had been up for hours, after all, trying to help Lisa with the baby. But then, the next night, it happened again.

I was holding Emma in my arms, rocking her gently, when she stopped crying and just... stared at me. Not like a baby would, with those wide, innocent eyes, but with a gaze that felt calculating. 

I felt my stomach churn, a wave of unease washing over me. 

""Hey, buddy, what’s going on?"" I muttered nervously, trying to laugh it off. But the moment I looked into her eyes again, I felt my pulse spike. Her gaze didn’t waver. It didn’t blink. And there was something about it that seemed... \*wrong\*. Too aware. Too... knowing.

I shook my head, placing her gently in her crib. I needed sleep, so badly, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching me, something \*waiting\* for me to let my guard down.

The following days didn’t get any better. It was as if the baby wasn’t just \*there\*. It was like she was \*aware\*—too aware for someone so young. And it wasn’t just her eyes. It was the way she would smile sometimes—this twisted little grin that made my skin crawl. It wasn’t the innocent, gurgling smile of a baby, but a smile that seemed to mock me, as if she knew something I didn’t.

Lisa thought I was losing my mind. ""You’re just tired,"" she would say, brushing it off with a laugh. ""She’s just a baby, Mark. You’re seeing things.""

But it wasn’t just the smile. It was the noises, too. I began hearing things. Whispers. Scratching sounds in the walls. The low hum of something \*wrong\*, like the house itself was alive with secrets I couldn’t understand.

One night, I woke up to the sound of giggling—high-pitched and childish, but... \*wrong\*. It wasn’t the sweet giggle of a baby. It was sharp, almost too loud in the silence of the night. 

I got out of bed, heart pounding in my chest, and stumbled toward Emma’s room. I was half-dazed, but when I opened the door, I froze.

She was sitting up in her crib, her back straight, her head tilted to the side. The room was dark, save for the faint glow of the moonlight creeping through the window, but even in the dimness, I could see her \*smiling\*—that same twisted, unnatural smile.

""Emma?"" My voice was hoarse, barely a whisper.

She giggled again, that same chilling, unnatural sound.

And then, she \*spoke\*.

""Hi, Daddy.""

I stumbled backward, my heart leaping into my throat. ""What... what the hell did you just say?""

Her eyes met mine—those dark, empty eyes—and her smile widened. ""I’m not your daughter, Daddy. I’m not your little girl.""

My blood ran cold. I slammed the door shut, my chest heaving, but the words echoed in my ears. They wouldn’t leave me. They wouldn’t stop.

I ran down the stairs, my body trembling. I had to get out of that house. I had to get away from her. The \*thing\* in her crib wasn’t my daughter. It couldn’t be.

I went to Lisa, shaking her awake. ""Lisa, wake up! We need to go—now!""

She blinked at me, confused, her hair messy from sleep. ""Mark, what’s wrong? What are you talking about?""

I couldn’t form the words. My mind was a blur, my thoughts racing faster than I could keep up. The baby wasn’t my daughter. It couldn’t be. The eyes, the smile, the voice...

Lisa followed me upstairs, still half-asleep, when I grabbed her arm. ""Don’t go in there. Don’t go near her.""

She frowned. ""Mark, you’re scaring me. You’re acting crazy. She’s just a baby.""

But I couldn’t stop. I couldn’t explain it. There was something inside me, a primal fear, telling me to run, to get as far away from Emma as possible. The thing that looked like her wasn’t my daughter. I didn’t know what it was, but I knew I had to protect my family.

Lisa opened the door to the nursery, and my heart skipped a beat.

The crib was empty.

""What the hell?"" Lisa whispered, stepping into the room. She looked around in confusion, her voice shaking. ""Mark, where is she?""

I stared at the empty crib, my mind racing. I didn’t know what was happening. I didn’t know what I was seeing. The whispers were back, louder now, crawling beneath my skin.

Suddenly, I heard a voice—Emma’s voice—clear as day, but coming from behind me. 

""Mommy, Daddy… I’m right here.""

I whipped around, my eyes wide with terror.

There, standing in the doorway of the nursery, was the figure of a little girl. But it wasn’t Emma. 

It was \*something else\*—a twisted, distorted version of her, a thing wearing her skin. Her hair was too long, too tangled, her skin pale and sickly, and her smile... \*that damn smile\*. It was wide, too wide, and her eyes—those dark, empty eyes—stared right through me, devoid of any warmth or humanity.

""No..."" I whispered, my throat tight. ""No, no, no…""

The thing that wasn’t my daughter stepped forward, its voice low and mocking. ""You thought you could protect them? You thought you could stop me? You’re too late, Daddy.""

I tried to run, but my legs wouldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t scream. All I could do was watch as the thing that looked like my daughter—\*wasn’t\* my daughter—moved closer.

It opened its mouth wide, and for the first time, I saw the darkness inside. The blackness was all-consuming, pulling me into it.

""Say goodbye, Daddy.""

1he5b8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1he5b8s/need_otc_recommendations_for_child/,Need OTC recommendations for child ,"Hi all, without going into too many specifics because it's a long story, I'll just say that our healthcare system in America is f***** up and it's been a nightmare trying to get my son the prescription he needs at the correct dosage and an affordable cost. And our pediatrician has been a nightmare to get a hold of as well. I called in his prescription 2 weeks ago almost and still don't have it. Multiple voicemails. 

Anyhow- the only way they'll up his dosage is if he comes in for another appointment (I know this is normal to come in every 3 months, but he's only had one prescription in the past 3 months because I had been trying to figure out where to get it at an affordable cost).

I'm going to hold off continuing to nag them and wait until our appointment this Friday. But he has been failing tests and is is being encouraged to drop out of the Spanish immersion program he's been in since kindergarten. He's almost 11, in 5th grade. He does extremely well when on the right medication (finally figured out generic Vyvanse works well even though it's more expensive). 

All that said, I just need something over the counter to get him through this week until we get to the doctor. Have any of you found that coffee helps? I've been reading mixed reviews on Reddit. Are there any other over-the-counter supplements to help get him through this week? I think his teachers are fed up and I would love something on hand for the future if we run out again.

I go to a naturopath for care, but things aren’t really helping. My stool test came back and the only thing my doctor addressed was the low amount of elastase-1, meaning my pancreas is not producing enough enzymes. So she just prescribed me ANOTHER supplement and sent me on my merry way. This same doctor also told me to follow a strict diet of gluten free, dairy free, no tomato, soy, corn, coffee. Which is fine, it’s just difficult being a broke college student and trying to navigate this diet. 

I’m feeling frustrated because my stool sample showed very high levels in other categories, that when I researched seemed concerning. And my doctor didn’t even bat an eye. For example: my Fusobacterium spp. levels were at 5.44, and a healthy amount is less than 1.008. I’m no doctor myself, but when I researched that, it’s not a good sign. Here is what I found online: “Fusobacterium spp. present in the oral and gut flora is carcinogenic and is associated with the risk of pancreatic and colorectal cancers.”

Anyway I’m starting to spiral and am just curious if anyone else with SIBO got similar results on their stool tests. Or if anyone is familiar with analyzing stool sample tests, I would be ever so appreciative of any comments or feedback.

Be cautious when renting from CAROLINE AND CYRUS BURKE, landlords with a property in Harris County, 77098

I rented a furnished 1-bedroom apartment from them for 6 months and encountered significant issues when it came to my $2,200 security deposit, which I believe was unfairly withheld.

Here are some of the charges they reported to withhold my deposit: 

- $1,350 for a 15-year-old dryer that stopped spinning effectively
- $700 for leak damage caused by the hurricane in May (a result of a soft wood panel on the second floor patio, signalling long term wear and tear on the property)
- $375 to move a couch, tv stand 3 feet
from where they were, and to re-hang drapes
- $130 to clean curtains (which only had slight discoloration lines from the hurricane leaks)
- $200 for an old TV stand drawer that didn’t slide properly due to a wheel falling off
- $180 for a scratch on a coffee table, which was already there and shown in move-in photos
- $170 for a loose old chair leg that simply needed tightening (something I had to do each week)
- $100 for “missing items,” which were shown in her move-out photos
- $50 for light bulbs I was told were damaged and unscrewed (were working just fine on my move out and were unable to be unscrewed) 

In my opinion, these charges may violate Texas Property Code 92.104, which prohibits landlords from withholding deposits for normal wear and tear and causality damage from weather events

Additionally, I’ve requested receipts and invoices to support these charges but they stopped responding to me upon the request

It was more like an escape, really and once we got here, I was able to realize the hellscape I was allowing myself and my children to exist in.  

I am getting notifications for the random acts of Christmas sub that I participated in over the last several years and it’s made hme so grateful for the kindness of strangers when I was trying to keep our lights on and make Christmas happen in complete poverty.  Living in poverty was a trauma that I didn’t even know existed.  After going through my bank account to give documents to my attorney, I realized that my ex husband had five separate jobs and that his income only paid for two months of rent in 2023.  The rest of last year was paid for by my financial aid, some help from a family friend, task work I had done online, and community resources.  He did the absolute bare minimum.  I had so much stress for years about making ends meet while he made crappy music and told internet strangers that his wife was too mentally ill for him to keep a job.  Reading about how happy I was to be living in our last unsafe apartment last year really put things in perspective.  

So here we are 13 months post separation.  I am shopping for Christmas presents with money that I earned.  I’ve never been able to afford them anything for a birthday or Christmas before and I’m kind of frozen.   I work from home now so I can take care of the kid stuff (lots of therapy after the divorce, health appts) and my own appointments.  I have lost close to 100lbs since I left, my kids have been thriving too.  I didn’t realize that I had been subconsciously trying to make myself unattractive so he would stop asking for sex.  (Ewww, that will have to be another post)  I feel like the independent creative person that I was before I met the narcissist.   My parents really saved us and it’s up to me now to finish some kind of tech training so we can eventually buy the condo from them or something of our own.  This sub really helped me with letting my frustration out when things were bad in prior years and I thought that I’d just reach out again and tell you all that things did get better.  I’ve left out a lot but as I’m sitting here in this beautiful house drinking my coffee I am just overwhelmed with gratitude. Maybe it’s the Christmas spirit 😂",21,1734189881.0,breakingmom,5,1.0,False

Trying Milky Cake blind was a wild experience and I went down the rabbit hole reading about it and Diego Bermudez afterward.

My favorites have been the Ethiopia - Fikadu Werika Chelibesa from Traffic and the Brazil - Vanessa Moreno from Morgon.

The room is a double bedroom with its private bathroom. It is the second bedroom in the flat and the full bathroom is yours, no one else will ever go in it.

I've been living in this property for over two years now, l am planning to extend my contract by another year however my roommate is moving out.

The flat is just 5 minutes from Pudding Mill Lane station (DLR) and a short walk to Stratford, close to great amenities like
Westfield Stratford, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, and riverside walks along the River Lea.

The rent is £1050 per month plus bills (approx. £150). Gas is included in the rent.

A bit about me - I'm a 31-year old, working in architecture. I’m a friendly, respectful, and tidy professional who loves creating a warm and welcoming home environment. I’m passionate about food. When I’m not exploring the city, I enjoy dancing or relaxing with a movie. I value a balance of personal space and quality time with my flatmate – whether it’s sharing a meal, chatting over coffee, or a cosy movie night. If you’re looking for someone who’s easygoing, considerate, and brings positive vibes to the flat, let’s chat!

Please feel free to reach out for more details or to request viewing. It would be great to set up one before 20 December as I'll not be in London for the holidays.
Moreover, contract and agency checks need to be done by the beginning of January. New tenancy contract starts in February.

For the seat, I used an old wooden shim used for leveling furniture and appliances. The legs are made of toothpicks. The back of the chair and spindles are wooden coffee stirrers that I cut down. I cut foam to figure out the size and shape of the back. Then I soaked the back strip for roughly 3 hours before clamping it to something that was the perfect size.. After drying for only a couple hours, it held its shape perfectly. From there, I just carefully glued in the spindles with tweezers. Oh yeah, I also sanded the seat to give it that leg and butt groove that wooden chairs usually have.

My phone is on its last legs. We're talking about a phone so old, it probably knew the dinosaurs.  💀  The battery life is basically nonexistent, the screen is more cracked than my sense of humor after pulling an all-nighter, and the storage is so full, it's practically begging for mercy. I've been using this phone since 2019.

As a uni student in my first semester, I'm drowning in assignments, presentations, and the ever-looming threat of graduation.  The struggle is REAL, and my dying phone is NOT helping. And the worst part is some of my important file getting automatically deleted from the phone system (my phone is insane im sobbing overnight because of this) 

But here's the kicker : I'm broke AF. Like, ramen-for-every-meal broke.  A shiny new phone is just a distant dream, and selling my current clunker won't even get me a cup of coffee. ☕️

So, I'm sending out an SOS to the Redditverse!  🙏  Does anyone know where I can find a decent but cheap smartphone that won't force me to sell a kidney? Or maybe, just maybe, someone out there has an old phone lying around that they'd be willing to part with for a good price?  (Please say yes! 🙏)

I'm not looking for anything fancy, just something that can keep up with my hectic student life.  Any help would be massively appreciated!  You guys are my only hope.. I think my phone will be survive only few months. The battery already kembung, crack all over the screen, don't say about camera quality as I think the Nokia one has better grade lol.

1he4trm,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1he4trm/im_32m_confused_about_a_date_36f/,I'm (32M) confused about a date (36F)?,"I met her about a year ago on a language learning app, we chatted quite a bit, good mornings and good nights, talked about our days, she's said stuff about how she's really comfortable talking to me. As a person she's very introverted, usually travels alone, goes out alone to movies, concerts, etc. has a close relationship with her mom. She loves snacks so I sent her a bunch from my country, and she sent me a big box too. She made plans to move to my country and finally did it 3 weeks ago. She moved to one of the bigger cities though, not mine, which is understandable if she's looking for a certain job. Early on she said she wanted to move to my city to see me but we never really figured out if we were more than friends. I'd like it to be, I've told her I like her, I've said she's cute many times, like when she shows me what snacks she bought or what restaurant she tried out and I think she liked that cause it turned into a habit for her to send me a photo of whenever she went.

I flew to her city for to meet her and we had a really nice time. I had 3 days and one evening and we spent all of it together, my hotel ended up being across the street from her condo so it worked out well. First day she bought me a bunch of snacks while we walked around, second day I returned the favor, and we checked out the city's tourist attractions. She would pull on my arm and tell me to open doors for her, carry her coffee while she looked at some clothes to buy, she liked anytime I complimented her and would ask what colors I thought she looked best in, and anytime we bought food or snacks or ice cream, we'd share them together. She started hand feeding me chips while my hands were full holding groceries, I was really surprised but it seemed obvious she likes me.

She told me she'd feel lonely when I leave. That was something I asked about when she still lived in her country, cause she never went out with friends, but said she never feels lonely. So as I'm about to take a taxi to the airport I hug her, and she starts crying. I'm sure for a lot of reasons, she probably just feels alone in a new country. I felt awful about it, tried to cheer her up, then kept texting her while I was on the way to the airport. In her country, Christmas is a romantic thing, she told me she has no plans with anyone except to wear pretty clothes. So I offered to send her gift money to buy some, she loved the idea and told me she'd show me what she buys.

So I had a great time and knowing how she usually likes to be alone, I felt really glad she chose to be with me. But earlier yesterday I asked her if we just went on a bunch of dates, her reply took 6 hours, it was ""just tourist attractions!"" and immediately changed the subject to ask how my day is. I think she's had some bad past relationships so I don't want to dig too deep into that if she's not comfortable. But I'm confused now. Is she saying ""let's just be friends"" after she obviously enjoyed her time? Is she scared of labelling it as a relationship? Am I missing something obvious?

Today I had a pack of coffee refilled while I was out for the morning. 

I know it was almost empty because I didn't want that last stale teaspoon of grounds in the packet for morning coffee, it was to be added to another batch later in the day. 

It went back in its spot in the fridge and I opened a new packet, made coffee and put that packet in a new spot. 

Back home I reach for the empty packet and it's full of coffee, not sealed as if new, filled to the top and neatly closed. The new one was still in its spot. 

I double checked both packets. I even checked the bin and there's no empty packet in there either.

My phone is on its last legs. We're talking about a phone so old, it probably knew the dinosaurs.  💀  The battery life is basically nonexistent, the screen is more cracked than my sense of humor after pulling an all-nighter, and the storage is so full, it's practically begging for mercy. I've been using this phone since 2019.

As a uni student in my first semester, I'm drowning in assignments, presentations, and the ever-looming threat of graduation.  The struggle is REAL, and my dying phone is NOT helping. And the worst part is some of my important file getting automatically deleted from the phone system (my phone is insane im sobbing overnight because of this) 

But here's the kicker : I'm broke AF. Like, ramen-for-every-meal broke.  A shiny new phone is just a distant dream, and selling my current clunker won't even get me a cup of coffee. ☕️

So, I'm sending out an SOS to the Redditverse!  🙏  Does anyone know where I can find a decent but cheap smartphone that won't force me to sell a kidney? Or maybe, just maybe, someone out there has an old phone lying around that they'd be willing to part with for a good price?  (Please say yes! 🙏)

I'm not looking for anything fancy, just something that can keep up with my hectic student life.  Any help would be massively appreciated!  You guys are my only hope.. I think my phone will be survive only few months. The battery already kembung, crack all over the screen, don't say about camera quality as I think the Nokia one has better grade lol.

1he4mbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1he4mbd/some_advice_for/,Some advice for ,"I’m F 46 dating 71 year old M. Please don’t judge. I moved somewhere new and over a 3 month period of neighborly kindness, mutual loneliness, deep emotionally intimate conversations, and - what I believed- general overarching compatibility- we expressed a mutual deep caring for each other that became a relationship. He has intense past trauma, little relationship experience (!), and major cancer and agent orange related health issues. Ok - before you ask wtf am I doing… I enjoy the time I have with him tremendously, he is oddly very attractive (and we have a strong physical mutual attraction), and he is very caring and enjoyable to be with. No issues… until about 4 months in. Now every thing seems to be about time. Which I understand completely when you are going on year 15 with cancer that gave you 6 months to live and physical pain is constant. 

I work 9 hr days from home with a high-demand job, have two animals I need to care for, and need about 2-3 hours a day to meditate, workout, and personal hygiene stuff and minimal housework. And I sleep 7-9 hours a day. So my personal days during the week are 18-21 hours. Weekends I spend as much time with him as possible while getting caught up with errands and cleaning etc. 

I also travel sometimes for a few days to seminars or to see my birth family 5 hours away. 

The issue I need help with is that he says I’m controlling. To be specific, he states that he’s never experienced me controlling him or his behavior but that I restrict my time to the degree he feels controlled. 

Here is our typical schedule when I’m home:
1. Every morning we talk on the phone or in person over coffee for 1-2 hours. If on the phone, it’s not considered spending time together by him.
2. Every evening or during the day we talk 1-2 hours on the phone here and there.
3. We spend about 2-4 hours in person 2-3 days a week. This in-person time is where I can do nothing except completely focus on him. Example: he gets upset if I’m doing my dishes and he sits at the counter talking with me.
4. Weekends I will spend 4-8+ hours with him  each Friday I’m off, Saturday, and Sunday. These times he is upset if “I have things to do”

If I travel we talk multiple times a day but he has accused me of cheating on him my last trip because I told him I had to get off the phone and chat an hour with a new female friend I met during the seminar we attended. 

So, part of the issue is I’m a very energetically sensitive introvert who requires a little alone time. I can spend 4 hours after work with him a few days a week but I need some time to be alone and chill in the tub with a glass of wine every few days. Or I can spend 12 hours on Saturday but want the evening to myself. He views my 1-2 glasses of wine I have around him as offensive (or not depending on his mood) so that is something I compromise on.

He says he could spend 24/7 365 with me but I personally believe people need some personal space sometimes.  Because of this I keep my door open to him for all times. I’ve offered he come over and relax or tinker while I work, I’ve gone to his place in the morning for an hour before starting work (late), and I’ve told him he can just come over anytime he wants as long as he understands I can’t just stop what I’m doing or work.

No matter what I do, he says he is “bothering” me, I’m controlling the relationship because I stipulate when I’m free to spend time with him, and he doesn’t consider we are spending time together unless the only thing I am doing is listening to his stories or woes, snuggling, or completely focusing entirely on him. 

I’m getting exhausted, I don’t understand why we can’t just be around each other and not do other things. This last fight, we were laying in bed after spending 4 hours together talking while I was doing things but connecting and running errands together followed by 2 hours having dinner together and snuggling on the couch with tv. While laying in bed, I checked my email while I thought he was dozing off and then he asked what I was doing, I explained, kept checking email … son called for 6 mins, then I had to run to the bathroom due to explosive tummy issue. Upon my exit, he had put on his boots, sitting in the dark, startled and embarrassed me by waiting (and I assume heard my potty issues ugh). We went back to bed, I pulled out my phone again and rolled over … he jumps out of bed, declares he leaving, storms out. 

Big fight ensued because I was on my phone. Totally fair except rather than asking me, he just got steamed up and started yelling. My response was to say I’m happy to not touch my phone anymore and to return to snuggle… he said it’s just over and stormed out.

I went over this morning after calling and just gave him full attention for 45 mins and then he proceeded to tell me how I’m demanding and controlling. After which he clarified it was about the relationship not me doing that to him. I asked for examples, validated his feelings and he said he didn’t feel comfortable coming over because I “always had something I was doing “ … but I how much of my life can I spend sitting down and focusing entirely on him and doing nothing else. He will say that after spending 4 hours on just us if I get up and say I need to clean or go to bed. 

This is not the first man to be like this so I’m obviously not seeing something I’m doing. Please help me fix my behaviors so this constant issue goes away. I can’t see what I’m doing wrong.",0,1734188324.0,datingoverforty,12,0.43,False
1he4m6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1he4m6r/my_brain_cant_process_any_info_anymore_i_went/,"My brain can't process any info anymore, I went full schizoid","I feel like my mind is split. I feel like them, nparents, and there’s nothing I can do to quench this feeling—because it isn’t a feeling. It’s knowledge. I know I feel this way, and I have no idea how to exist in any other reality. You could stand in front of me, tell me I have hands, legs, and a body, but I wouldn’t be able to follow. I cannot process reality in any way other than knowing I’m in trouble and feeling like absolute shit. That is my only accessible part of reality.  

When I feel this way, nothing else matters anymore. How could I care about anything when I know the life I’d care about is so fundamentally worthless anyway? I can’t label my actions as anything other than “trying to recover from this,” because if I were to feel saved, if I believed my life was worth living, I wouldn’t even know what existing means. I wouldn’t know why I’d want to do something as mundane as drinking coffee. My entire existence would collapse without this struggle.  

All day, I run from reality. I pretend I don’t feel this way. I’ve rewritten the narrative of my reality so many times, searching for a new frame of vision. I’ve wasted more brainpower “correcting” things than all OCD patients combined, yet I remain aware of the one thing that feels undeniably real: I am not who I should have been. I don’t exist.  

The other night, I nearly had a heart attack from fear when I realized that every time I try to explain how things aren’t as bad as they seem, the person doing the explaining is still me. I waste my life justifying myself to myself—a dictator superego so worthless and inhumane that I’d rather feel nothing than feel it. But it’s inside me, and even when I’m not consciously thinking about it, all I hear is this dictator—this them.  

I can’t plan. I can’t do anything. The split in my brain intrudes on every action. If I try to stand up to light a cigarette, my body doesn’t recognize what’s happening. It can’t process the command, because the person occupying this body—me—doesn’t exist in a way that makes sense to it. It crashes. My default knowledge is that I am them, not me.  

I can’t think—really think—because my attempts to reason are always interrupted. I crash every time I try. I know only that I am unable to see me. All I hear is them.  

Do you know what’s worse than hearing a voice invalidate you? It’s when you start answering it—arguing with it—trying to prove it wrong. Instead of feeling relief, you feel even worse, because you realize you’re trying to justify yourself to yourself. You’re proving your worth to your own mind. It’s like stepping outside of your disconnected, numb self and briefly meeting the real version of you—the dictator that tears you down. It feels more vivid, more powerful, and more real than any drug. That’s why, the other night, I almost had a heart attack.  

In one of my many attempts to disprove what my brain accuses me of, I realized I had channeled my way to the source of all this—the voice I’ve been battling. It was me. I am worthless, disgusting, hopeless, insincere, and corrupt. And I knew it was what I was feeling.

That realization destroyed my last hope for recovery. How can you recover when your primary knowledge—your core feeling—is that you are part of your parents? It’s as if the narcs in my life live in my brain. Recovery would mean convincing those narcs to understand what’s happening, but that’s impossible. They’ll never change.  

And here’s the core problem: how do I make sense of anything? Even if I accept this feeling, it only means I accept my psyche as the narcissist it is. But if I am both a narc and anti-narc at the same time, how can I treat myself? Anything I do feels wrong. Self-care feels like I’m caring for them, and self-harm feels like I’m finally standing up to them—but it destroys the part of me trying to recover.  

It’s a no-win situation. Everything is self-contradictory, mutually exclusive. How do you recover when there’s no one in your mind rooting for you? Recovery would mean convincing the same mind that broke you in the first place. It would mean returning to the very same mental framework that needs to be convinced of this new truth—a framework that refuses to believe. It's because the brain that punishes me and makes me care for all this is already them anyway - because I know I didn't have to deal with any of this anyway. To listen to this brain is already enslaving because it's not me, it's them. But if I don't listen to that, I don't even have any reason to make optimal decisions in life anymore, because I don't hear any other complaints but them. I wish I could make this make better sense but yeah even this is kindergartened down in simplicity compared to how more messed up it feels inside. 

I don't know how to feel any emotion that doesn't mean them benefitting from it. I tried to feel happy about funny Reddit post now but my brain interrupts my emotion, telling me it's theirs not mine.

The sheer implausibility of this situation is beyond comprehension. I don’t even know how I’m still sane. I feel totally paralysed, I can't do most things. I am at the verge of fully immersing myself into a schizoid exile.",1,1734188313.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False
1he4m60,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rabbits/comments/1he4m60/bunny_keeps_waking_me_up_5306am/,Bunny keeps waking me up 5:30-6am,"In the last month my rabbit has been waking me up at ungodly hours and I am at my wits end. I am so sleep deprived it’s not even funny. She has done this one other time when she was about 6 months old but it stopped after a horrendous 2 months (I was in high school at the time so it really was bad).

I’m not sure what broke the cycle and had her waking up around my schedule but I sorely need advice because I work a job that requires concentration and a steady hand which I do not have if I’m running off that little sleep or 6 coffees. It wouldn’t be so much of an issue if she was just scratching at the bars of her pen, but she’s chewing the baseboard around the door which forces me to get up (she doesn’t chew it any other time so I’m certain it’s literally only to wake me up). I rent so it’s kind of a problem. 

For reference, I have tried just getting up and doing the morning routine at that time (which stopped her from chewing, but I can’t fall back asleep after and don’t want her to think this is the new normal), bringing her up into my bed for a cuddle (that also works sometimes and I can get a half hour of sleep before she wants to go to her litter box), and ignoring her until a reasonable time to hopefully get her normal schedule back (does not work in the slightest). I live in Canada and the sun doesn’t rise until 8am in the winter so I’m just really confused as to why she’s doing this now. 

Any advice would be welcome. 

(Info about her: she’s 4 years old, I’ve had her since she was 4 months old, behaviour started in the past 30 days, she was spayed at a year old)

Today, a stranger struck up a conversation with me at a local coffee shop while I was enjoying a snack and coffee with my kids. 

He shared that classic piece of advice from older parents: enjoy the early years, they go by so quickly. It's advice I've always cherished and taken to heart.

But then, he added something that truly stuck with me. 

He said time seems to fly because life is beautiful when you're grateful. We're fortunate to live in a safe, vibrant city with so much to look forward to—tomorrow, next week, next year. 

But, he reminded me, not everyone has that optimism about the future. For some, there's no certainty about their next meal or what tomorrow holds. For them, the future isn’t something to anticipate.

I walked away from that conversation with a renewed sense of gratitude. 

It was a small moment, but it made a big impact.

And as I left, one thought lingered: maybe time flies not just because our lives are busy, but because we’re so blessed with things worth looking forward to. 

If that’s the case, then slowing down might just start with appreciating what we already have—because for some, the future isn’t promised...

1he4kai,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomizedGifts101/comments/1he4kai/unwrap_creativity_6_unexpected_gift_ideas_for/,Unwrap Creativity: 6 Unexpected Gift Ideas for Special Occasions,"## Move away from mainstream gifts. Here are unique ideas to make every occasion special.

What are some unique gift ideas for special occasions? Are you tired of giving (and receiving) the same old gifts year after year? I was too, until I started thinking outside the (gift) box. Let's explore some creative, thoughtful, and downright fun gift ideas that will make your special occasions truly exceptional.
  
  
## Personalized Experiences

When it comes to unique gift ideas, there's something truly magical about personal experiences. One year, for my friend Sam's birthday, I decided to surprise him with a hot air balloon ride. Now, let me tell you, I had never seen someone look so bewildered while I was presenting the gift. It wasn't just the fact that he was going to float hundreds of feet in the air; it was the thought that counted! 

The day arrived, and as we ascended into the sky, Sam's face lit up like a Christmas tree. He was both terrified and exhilarated, shouting “Look, I can see my house from here!” It was a moment that not only created memories for both of us but also solidified our friendship in a way that material gifts never could. 

Experiences like this can vary widely depending on the occasion. Think cooking classes for food lovers or art workshops for aspiring Picassos. For anniversary gifts, why not plan a weekend getaway to a place that holds special meaning? 

The key to planning these experiences is to pay attention to what your loved ones truly cherish. That way, you’ll craft a day they’ll remember—because who needs another sweater when you could have a story to tell?

## Handmade Treasures

Handmade gifts have an irresistible charm that mass-produced items simply can’t match. Imagine unwrapping a beautiful scarf, knowing it was knit stitch by stitch by someone who poured love into every loop. That’s the magic of a handmade treasure! Seriously, even a lopsided pottery mug can bring a smile—especially if the creator crafted it with a sweet backstory or a funny anecdote about a clay disaster. Trust me, those mugs can spark more joy than the fanciest china.

Exploring local artisans at art fairs or markets can be like embarking on a treasure hunt. I've strolled through colorful booths, my eyes wide, discovering everything from hand-painted ornaments to handcrafted jewelry that tells a unique story. You can even chat with the creators about their process, which adds an extra layer to the gift. Do you think your friend would prefer a painting of their favorite spot or a quirky sculpture made from recycled materials? Hmmm… choices, choices!

And let’s not forget about DIY projects! If you’re feeling a little adventurous, why not try making something yourself? A scrapbook filled with photos and doodles screams, “I care!” It’s not about perfection—it's about the thought and effort you put in. Handmade gifts carry an emotional value that says, “I know you, and you mean the world to me.” What could be more special than that?

## Subscription Surprises

Subscription gifts are like a treasure chest of surprises that keep on giving! Every month feels like a mini-holiday, doesn’t it? Imagine the joy of receiving a delightful package, all wrapped up and bursting with goodies tailored just for you. It’s like Christmas in July—or any month for that matter!

When diving into the world of subscription gifts, the options are as varied as toppings on a pizza. You’ve got services for book lovers, snack enthusiasts, art supplies, and even those crafty DIY kits that unleash your inner artist. The trick is to really think about what the recipient loves. Do they have a soft spot for mystery novels? Or maybe they’re always on the hunt for the latest gourmet treats? The possibilities are endless!

Now, here’s a fun tip: consider personalizing the subscription. Maybe add a note every month, or choose gifts that relate to their hobbies. That way, they’ll feel that extra sprinkle of love with each delivery. Plus, who doesn’t enjoy anticipating a nice surprise every month? It’s like a constant reminder that someone cares. So, let the joy of monthly surprises begin, and watch that recipient light up with every delivery!

## Personalized Gourmet Gifts

When you think of gifts, what often springs to mind? A box of chocolates? A fancy sweater? Well, let me tell you, there's a treasure trove of unique options out there, especially in the world of personalized gourmet gifts. Picture this: a beautifully arranged gourmet gift basket that tells a story, each item carefully selected based on the recipient's tastes. It’s like giving a piece of art that’s delicious to boot!

Imagine curating a basket filled with locally sourced goodies. Maybe it’s artisanal cheeses from the local farm or handcrafted chocolates made right in your hometown. Not only are you supporting local businesses, but you’re also introducing the lucky recipient to flavors they might not find anywhere else. It’s a little slice of your community wrapped up in a pretty package!

Now, here’s where the personal touch comes in—add a handwritten note or even a quirky recipe that uses some of the basket items. How about pairing that fancy olive oil with an unusual spice? It's like hosting a tiny culinary adventure! And don’t forget to think about themes—go for a picnic basket vibe, a cozy movie night setup, or even a ""spa day"" with homemade treats. The possibilities are endless, and each choice shows you truly care. So, are you ready to start your gourmet gift-giving adventure?

## Tech Gadgets Gone Wild

Tech gadgets have taken a delightful turn into the whimsical and unexpected! When it comes to finding unique gifts, tapping into the world of device wizardry can lead you down a rabbit hole of joy and sometimes ridiculousness. Remember when I got my friend that quirky gadget shaped like a tiny robot? He added it to his desk, and lo and behold, it became the unofficial team mascot!

So, how do you find the perfect quirky tech gift? Start by thinking about what makes the recipient grimace with glee. Do they love music? Consider a light-up Bluetooth speaker that makes them feel like they're at a rave in their living room. Or maybe they’re into cooking; a smart kitchen scale that talks to them like a quirky sous-chef can spark joy and laughter at the same time!

And don’t underestimate the joy of quirky gadgets that serve no real purpose other than to entertain. How about a USB-powered mini vacuum for an office desk? It's both bizarre and oddly satisfying to use!

Gifting someone a geeky gadget isn’t just about the item; it's about the smiles, the laughter, and the ""where in the world did you find this?"" moments. Remember, in the realm of tech gifts, the crazier, the better!

## Gifts That Give Back

When you think of gift-giving, have you ever considered how your choice could have a ripple effect that spreads far beyond just the recipient? Gifts that give back are like magic beans—plant one and watch it grow into something wonderful! Imagine gifting a cozy blanket while knowing that the proceeds help shelter the homeless. It’s the warm fuzzies multiplied!

Volunteering your time at a local charity as a gift can be just as heartfelt. Your hands can become the gift that keeps on giving. When I volunteered at a food bank last year, I realized the joy in seeing smiles on people's faces when they receive food they might’ve otherwise gone without. It hit me right in the feels! It’s not just about what you give, but about how it helps others. 

Read more: <https://tedsadvice.com/what-are-some-unique-gift-ideas-for-special-occasions> 

And then there are those charming social enterprises—businesses created not just to sell, but to make a difference. Think of fair-trade coffee or handmade bags crafted by artisans in developing countries. Each purchase helps to support communities and provide a better life. 

Wouldn't it be a treat to know your gift is helping someone in need? Now, that’s a present that sparkles!

## Conclusions

""So, Mabel,"" Soos began, scratching his chin with a goofy grin, ""where’s your girl gang? It’s kinda weird seeing you without Grenda and Candy by your side. Usually, the Shack is filled with the sound of Grenda’s laugh or Candy’s… uh, intense stare.""

Mabel chuckled, slightly embarrassed, “Yeah, it is kinda weird, isn’t it? Feels like my arms are missing or something. But they’re out of town for now.”

Soos raised his eyebrows. “Out of town? You didn’t scare them off with one of your pranks, did ya? Like, no fake werewolf howls at midnight?”

Mabel laughed, shaking her head. “Not this time! Grenda’s actually still dating that rich guy, you know, the one she met at the party? Pacifica’s cousin? She’s all caught up with fancy brunches and yacht rides now.”

Soos looked impressed, whistling. “Dang, Grenda’s living it up in the high life! I knew she was one tough cookie, but look at her now—swimming with the rich and famous. That girl deserves it!”

“Totally! She’s been texting me pics of all the crazy rich-kid stuff they’re doing, like horseback riding and taking these super dramatic black-and-white selfies on a beach. She’s a whole new Grenda!” Mabel’s voice was tinged with pride, even as she bit her lip a bit, clearly missing her friend.

Soos leaned in, his tone shifting. “And what about Candy? I thought she’d be your ride-or-die for spooky nights like these. You know, with all the scary stories and stuff around Halloween, I’d bet she’d be all over that.”

“Yeah, I thought so too,” Mabel admitted, her shoulders slumping a bit. “But she’s with her family, helping them with their store out of town. So I’m kinda flying solo on this one.”

Soos gave her an understanding nod. “Must feel strange, huh? You’re usually leading the whole squad. But hey, you got Dipper! And, uh… I guess me and Stan, which is, like, half as cool, but still counts!”

Mabel’s face brightened, and she punched Soos playfully on the arm. “Are you kidding? You’re like my bonus big brother, Soos! And don’t get me started on Stan—he’s in his own class of weird. He’s totally the fearless leader we need!”

Soos laughed, leaning back. “Yeah, if ‘fearless’ means ‘hiding behind the cash register at the first sign of danger,’ Stan’s got that covered! But hey, don’t sweat it, Mabel. We’ve got your back, even if your crew’s not here. Besides, who knows, maybe you’ll meet someone new to join the mystery squad, right?”

Mabel’s eyes sparkled with mischief. “Who knows, Soos? Maybe I will… In fact, I might already have my eye on a mysterious someone…”

Soos raised an eyebrow, leaning forward eagerly. “Ooooh! Now, this sounds juicy. Spill the beans, Mabel! Who’s the mystery person?”

Mabel hesitated, biting her lip with a glint of excitement. “Well… you’ll just have to wait and see. Let’s just say, he’s not like anyone I’ve met before.”

Soos gave her an approving look, nodding. “Oho! Sounds like some next-level mystery, dude. You go, Mabel! Just, you know, don’t go inviting any weirdos back to the Shack… unless they’re, like, 10% less weird than we are.”

Mabel burst out laughing. “Oh, come on, Soos! I think I can manage that. And besides, no one could ever be as weird as us!”

Mabel paused for a moment, her eyes scanning the Shack as if searching for something she couldn’t quite place. “Hey, Soos… speaking of people, have you seen Melody around? I thought she’d be here, you know, hanging out or something.”

Soos scratched his head, looking thoughtful. “Melody? Oh yeah, she was here for a bit, but, uh…” He trailed off, his expression shifting slightly. “She actually headed back home the other day. Said something about, you know, needing a breather from all the weirdness around here.”

Mabel blinked in surprise. “Really? Huh. That’s… weird. She seemed to be having a blast.”

Soos shrugged. “Yeah, she seemed like it, but I think Gravity Falls was just a bit too much for her. You know how it is here—things can get pretty crazy. She’s probably just chilling with her folks now. I don’t think it was anything personal.”

“Hmm…” Mabel’s voice was soft, her thoughts clearly elsewhere. “Yeah, I get that. I mean, the weirdness around here can get… overwhelming sometimes. But still, I was hoping she’d stick around a bit longer.”

Soos gave her a sympathetic grin. “Hey, don’t sweat it, Mabel. You know what they say—people come and go, but the weirdness here? It’s forever.” He laughed, trying to lighten the mood. “Besides, you’ve still got me, Stan, and Dipper. We’re your crew, remember?”

Mabel smiled faintly, trying to shake off the feeling of missing another friend. “Yeah, I guess so. It just feels kinda strange, y’know? Everyone’s either busy or gone… It’s like things are changing, and I’m just stuck here, waiting for the next big adventure.”

Soos nodded thoughtfully, giving her a friendly pat on the back. “Well, you know what they say, Mabel. You never know what’s right around the corner. Something wild’s bound to happen, especially with you around. Just keep your eyes peeled—who knows, maybe your mysterious guy might be part of the next big thing.”

Mabel grinned, her eyes twinkling with excitement. “You know what, Soos? You’re probably right. And when it happens, you’ll be the first to know.”

They shared a laugh, and for a moment, the Shack felt just as warm and lively as it did when her friends were around. 

Until Mabel stumbled upon a strikingly handsome man by the vending machine in the Shack. He had an aura that was almost unnatural.

""Who’s that?"" Mabel whispered, her cheeks flushing as she approached Soos, trying to keep her voice low but her excitement obvious. “He looks like he walked straight out of a magazine!”

“That’s Jerry,” Soos replied, with a knowing grin. ""He’s been in Gravity Falls for years, and folks say he’s super mysterious. Like, he never really hangs out with anyone. Just kinda… keeps to himself.”

Mabel tilted her head, intrigued. ""Mysterious? Ooh, I like that! So, what do you think he does? Is he a secret agent? A vampire? A... maybe even a ghost?”

Soos chuckled, scratching his head. “Nah, I don’t think he’s a ghost. Unless he’s a super chill one. But yeah, he’s got that vibe, you know?”

As Mabel walked closer to Jerry, she felt her heart flutter, a rare mix of nervousness and excitement. Clearing her throat, she mustered her most cheerful tone. “Hey there! I don’t think we’ve met before. I’m Mabel Pines, and you must be…”

Jerry turned toward her, his sharp features illuminated by the dim glow of the vending machine. His smile was disarmingly charming. “Jerry. Just Jerry.” His voice was smooth, almost velvety, and it sent a small shiver down Mabel’s spine.

“Well, Just Jerry,” she said with a playful lilt, “welcome to the Mystery Shack! Land of mysteries, wonders, and weird snacks you can find in a vending machine.” She pointed to the machine behind him, her eyes twinkling with silliness.

Jerry chuckled, his gaze unwavering. “Is that right? Then I suppose I’ve found the most intriguing thing here.”

Mabel blinked, her face heating up. “W-Wait, are you talking about me?”

“Who else?” he replied with a smirk, his tone flirtatious but somehow calm.

Mabel burst out laughing, though it was mostly to hide her growing blush. “Wow, smooth operator! I’ll have to give you points for confidence. So, Jerry, what brings a mysterious guy like you to our humble little Shack?”

Jerry leaned against the vending machine, his posture casual yet poised. “I like to wander. This town has… its own unique charm. And now, it seems, even more so.”

Mabel giggled, twirling a loose strand of hair. “Okay, okay, stop! You’re going to turn me into a tomato over here!” She waved her hands dramatically, trying to cool her cheeks. “So, do you like, do mysterious guy things? Like solving ancient riddles or battling secret underground societies?”

Jerry raised an eyebrow, amused. “What if I said yes?”

“Then I’d say you’re officially the coolest person I’ve ever met!” Mabel exclaimed, her voice full of exaggerated awe. “Okay, real talk—what’s your deal? Are you a spy? A vampire? Wait, do you sparkle in sunlight?”

Jerry laughed, a deep and genuine sound. “No sparkling, I’m afraid. And as for my deal, well… some things are better left mysterious.”

Mabel pretended to swoon, her hand dramatically placed on her forehead. “Ugh, you’re killing me with the mystery, Jerry! Okay, fine, I’ll bite—how about you tell me over dinner? Like, a date? You, me, food that’s not from a vending machine?”

Jerry’s eyes flickered with surprise, followed by a smirk. “You’re quite bold, aren’t you?”

“Bold, brave, and full of awesome,” Mabel declared, striking a playful pose. “So, what do you say?”

Jerry pretended to think for a moment before nodding. “How could I say no to that? Consider it a date, Mabel Pines.”

Before Mabel could reply, a sharp voice cut through the air. “Mabel, who’s that?”

She turned to see Dipper standing a few feet away, his arms crossed and a wary look on his face. His eyes darted from Mabel to Jerry, his suspicion evident.

“Oh, hey, Dipper!” Mabel said with a nervous laugh, stepping slightly in front of Jerry. “We were just… talking.”

“Talking?” Dipper’s eyes narrowed. “About what?”

“Nothing important!” Mabel waved him off, her cheeks burning. “Don’t worry about it!”

Dipper took a few more steps forward, his eyes scanning Jerry carefully. He didn’t quite like the way Jerry’s smile lingered, the casual confidence in his posture making Dipper uneasy. “Mabel, who’s that?” he asked again, his voice slightly sharper this time.

Mabel quickly stepped away from Jerry, trying to act casual. “Oh, this is Jerry! We were just—uh—talking.”

Jerry, not missing a beat, stepped forward with his hand outstretched. “Nice to meet you, Dipper,” he said smoothly, his smile just as charming as before.

Dipper stared at Jerry’s hand, his eyes narrowing, as if trying to figure out some hidden meaning behind the gesture. His arms remained crossed tightly, and he didn’t move for a moment, his gaze still focused on Jerry.

Jerry’s hand hovered mid-air, waiting.

Dipper remained silent, his frown deepening.

Jerry raised an eyebrow, but didn’t seem at all put off by Dipper’s standoffish behavior. “I promise I don’t bite,” he added with a teasing smile, though his voice held a certain calm assurance.

After a tense pause, Dipper reluctantly shook Jerry’s hand, though his grip was firm and deliberate, as if trying to assert some kind of control over the situation. “I’m not sure how I feel about meeting strangers in Gravity Falls,” Dipper muttered, still suspicious.

Mabel, sensing the tension, quickly interjected. “Oh, Dipper, don’t worry! Jerry’s cool! We were just talking about… uh, the mysteries of Gravity Falls! You know, the usual weird stuff. Nothing to worry about.”

Dipper raised an eyebrow. “Mysteries? What kind of mysteries? And wait—didn’t you just meet this guy?”

“Well, yeah,” Mabel said, her voice light as she quickly sidestepped, trying to ease the situation. “But he’s interesting! He’s got that ‘I know more than I’m telling you’ vibe, you know? And he’s not from around here, so I think he’s got some cool stories.” She gave Jerry a playful grin, hoping to distract Dipper with her usual charm.

Dipper didn’t look convinced, his eyes flicking between Mabel and Jerry. “I don’t know, Mabel. I’ve got a bad feeling about this.”

Mabel shrugged nonchalantly. “Come on, Dipper! I’m not a little kid anymore. I can handle myself.”

“Yeah, but…” Dipper hesitated, his concern for her showing. “This guy—what do we really know about him, Mabel? You’re going on a date with someone you just met?”

Mabel sighed dramatically. “Oh, Dipper, you worry too much! It’s just dinner—nothing big! He’s harmless.”

“I’m harmless,” Jerry echoed, smiling again, though there was a slight edge to his tone. “I promise, Dipper. No tricks, no hidden agendas. Just dinner with your sister.”

Dipper gave him a skeptical look, still not entirely trusting him. “Fine. But I don’t like this. Keep your eyes open, Mabel.”

Mabel shot Dipper a grin and patted his shoulder. “Relax, Dipper. It’s just a dinner. What’s the worst that could happen?”

Dipper didn’t look convinced, but he knew there was no way he could stop her. “Just… be careful, alright?”

“I will!” Mabel said with a wink, her usual confidence returning. “I’ll text you the details later, Dipper! No biggie.” 

As Mabel and Jerry walked out of the Mystery Shack, Dipper stood in the doorway, his eyes fixed on the retreating figures. His brow furrowed with concern. Wendy leaned casually against the counter, munching on a bag of chips.

“You good, dude?” Wendy asked, glancing at Dipper.

Dipper crossed his arms, still staring after Mabel and Jerry. “I don’t know, Wendy. There’s something about that guy that feels… off. He just shows up out of nowhere, charms Mabel in five minutes, and now they’re going on a date?”

Wendy raised an eyebrow, clearly amused. “So? What’s the big deal? Mabel’s not a kid anymore, Dipper. She can handle herself.”

“Yeah, but—” Dipper hesitated, struggling to put his unease into words. “This is Gravity Falls. Weird stuff happens here all the time. You’d think we’d learn to be a little more cautious.”

Wendy shrugged, popping another chip in her mouth. “Maybe. But it’s not like every new person in town is secretly a ghost or a monster. Sometimes, people are just people.”

Dipper turned to face her fully, his expression serious. “You don’t think it’s weird? He’s just… too perfect. Too smooth.”

Wendy smirked. “So what? You jealous?”

“What? No!” Dipper sputtered, his face flushing. “This isn’t about me! It’s about Mabel. She deserves better than some sketchy guy who—who might have some kind of secret agenda!”

Wendy chuckled, shaking her head. “Relax, man. Mabel’s been waiting for a guy like this since, like, forever. Let her have some fun. Besides, you’re always there to swoop in and save the day if things get too weird, right?”

Dipper sighed, his shoulders slumping. “I guess. But I’m keeping an eye on him. Something’s not right.”

“Suit yourself, dude,” Wendy said with a shrug. “But if you’re wrong, you’re gonna owe me big time.”

That evening, Dipper decided to discreetly spy on Mabel and Jerry during their date on the Greasy's Diner. He slipped into the diner and took a seat a few tables away, trying to keep out of sight, but his eyes were glued to the couple.

Mabel and Jerry sat across from each other, laughing and chatting. Mabel’s eyes sparkled with excitement as she scanned the menu, her fingers tapping eagerly on the table.

“I can’t believe I haven’t been on a proper date like this in forever!” Mabel exclaimed, practically bouncing in her seat. “Okay, so I’m definitely getting two pancakes, extra syrup! And... ooh! Garlic peanuts, my favorite!”

Jerry’s expression shifted ever so slightly at the mention of garlic. He leaned forward, his voice gentle but firm. “Maybe skip the garlic peanuts tonight, Mabel. Trust me, they might not be as enjoyable as you think.”

Mabel blinked, tilting her head in confusion. “What? Why not? I like garlic peanuts!”

Jerry chuckled, his smile a bit too tight. “Let’s just say they’re not my favorite. How about something else? Maybe the fries instead?”

Dipper, watching from afar, furrowed his brow. Why would Jerry be so against garlic?

Just then, Pacifica Northwest, now working part-time at the diner, approached their table, flashing her signature grin. “Hey, Mabel! Long time no see! What can I get for you two lovebirds?”

Mabel beamed. “Two pancakes, extra syrup for me! And—”

Pacifica cut her off with a teasing smirk. “Hold up—Mabel Pines on a date? Color me surprised!”

Mabel giggled. “Yup! This is Jerry, and he’s amazing! Isn’t he dreamy?”

Jerry gave Pacifica a polite nod, his gaze steady. “Nice to meet you, Pacifica.”

“Yeah, likewise…” Pacifica hesitated, eyeing him with a hint of suspicion. “So, pancakes it is! And what about you, Mr. Dreamy?”

Jerry’s smile didn’t waver. “Just a coffee, thanks.”

Pacifica raised an eyebrow. “No food?”

“Not hungry,” Jerry replied simply.

Mabel glanced at him, surprised. “You sure? I mean, Greasy’s food is the best!”

Jerry’s smile stayed fixed. “I’ll eat later. Tonight’s just about spending time with you.”

Dipper scribbled down notes in his journal, each odd detail adding to his suspicion. Why doesn’t he eat? What’s his problem with garlic?

After Pacifica brought the food, Mabel leaned forward, resting her chin on her hand as she studied Jerry. “So, Jerry, what’s your deal? You’re like this big mystery, and I gotta solve it!”

Jerry laughed softly, his gaze calm but intense. “I’m really not that mysterious. Just a guy who enjoys the quiet life. I prefer to keep things… simple.”

Mabel pouted, playfully nudging his arm. “Oh, come on, everyone’s got a story! What about your family? Where are they?”

Jerry’s eyes darkened for a split second before he recovered, his smile back in place. “They’re… not around anymore. It’s just me now.”

“Oh…” Mabel’s playful expression softened. “I’m sorry to hear that. Must be lonely.”

Jerry shrugged, his tone almost too casual. “I’m used to it.”

Dipper leaned in closer, straining to hear every word. He’s way too vague. He’s hiding something. He scribbled more in his journal, his resolve growing. ""Whatever it is, I’ll figure it out.""

Just then, Pacifica walked by, her tray balanced with orders, and glanced at Dipper. “Spying, huh?” she whispered with a smirk.

“Shh!” Dipper hissed. “Just… keep an eye out.”

Pacifica rolled her eyes but nodded. “Fine, but you owe me one, Pines.”

Back at the table, Mabel poured syrup over her pancakes, grinning. “Seriously, Jerry, you gotta open up more! Life’s too short to be all mysterious!”

Jerry leaned back, eyes glinting with an unreadable expression. “You like adventure, huh?”

“Duh!” Mabel laughed. “Gravity Falls is practically a magnet for weird stuff. I love every minute of it!”

Jerry’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. “You don’t know half of it, Mabel.”

Dipper’s fist clenched under the table. What did he mean by that?

Jerry turned to Mabel, voice soft but laced with something darker. “Sometimes… mysteries are best left unsolved.”

Mabel giggled, oblivious. “Not for me! I’m all about solving mysteries!”

Dipper stared hard at Jerry, his suspicions deepening.

1he4e06,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawyerAdvice/comments/1he4e06/refunded_my_689_coffee/,refunded my 6.89$ coffee. ,"I don't drink coffee. But after a 14 hour shift my ass needed to stay awake to drive a few miles home, so I tried it.

I'm so tired of deceptive advertising. In this case, Coffee shops don't even show you the prices anymore. Or the prices they show for their drinks don't match the drink that you're buying and the drink you're buying doesn't have any prices advertised.

I wanted a regular caramel latte. I'm thinking it's going to be about 3.50$ maybe 3.75 with the whipped cream and all that. Apparently the only size that the ""Normal size"" caramel latte comes in is the ""Grande size"". . . GRANDE MEANS LARGE... Did I ask for a large? no. I asked for a regular. But there's no pricing on the pictures. Regular, doesn't mean large. That's false advertising. when every other drink, regular is 12 ounces, not 16. So I took my Grande caramel coffee and I put in a dispute in my bank app and refunded it.

I think this was my breaking point of how often we let stuff like this slide. It's like with buying cars. If I step onto a car-lot and the price of the car is 3,000$ then it should be 3,000$ and if it's not then you need to add all the extra pricings to the price tag or right underneath it. Almost Federal minimum wage hourly for a regular coffee... 6.89$ cents.

So where do I start with changing the law. I'll run for governor if I have to. ",0,1734187633.0,LawyerAdvice,2,0.2,False
1he4dk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/pune/comments/1he4dk6/pune_metro/,Pune metro,"So there I was, just trying to survive another soul-sucking metro ride. Got a seat after wrestling half the city for it, and thought I’d scroll my phone in peace. But no. Peace is a myth when you're surrounded by “Main Character Syndrome” auditions.

First, this girl plops down sideways on her chair like she’s in a moody perfume ad. And then, in comes this guy, looking like he’s been rehearsing his lines in front of a mirror for days.

Now, I’m stuck listening to this cringe conversation. The girl looks like she’d rather die than engage, but she’s trapped—seat over freedom, classic dilemma. Meanwhile, the guy thinks he’s the hero of a rom-com, dropping lines like, ""You give off boring vibes, don’t take it personally."" Bro, that’s like saying, ""You’re ugly, but it’s fine."" Who taught him to talk to people? Reddit motivational posts?

Then he asks her to rate his outfit. Are you serious? I almost snorted my coffee. The girl gives him an 8/10, which is way too generous for someone wearing a shirt that screams ""80% off Sale."" And then, as his stop comes, he has the audacity to say, ""Hope I uplifted your mood."" Dude, the only mood you uplifted was mine—laughing at this disaster.

I thought that was the end of it, but no. He asks for her Insta ID like this train ride was Tinder. She’s 19, he’s 28—Sir, no! As he got off the metro, I prayed silently for the girl’s sanity and hoped this conversation is over..

And now, I come to Reddit for solace, only to find both of their posts here. She’s like, “Hope he’s not on Reddit,” and he’s like, “Hope she’s not on Reddit.” Meanwhile, I’m just here thinking, “Why are you two trauma-dumping your awkwardness on the internet instead of the metro like normal people?”

Dear universe, next time, please seat me next to someone who eats snacks in peace.

I’ve tried to have serious conversations with you multiple times. and, i’ve tried to talk on the phone as well and you have declined my attempts. I️ don’t think it’s fair to me that you go one week being very into me and the next week to rejecting me to my face at a coffee shop with no explanation. This has been utterly confusing. I️ have a lot of sympathy for you, empathy even since I’m going through a similar situation, and I’ve tried many ways to connect with you and help you, but it seems like you don’t want me to be there for you. This has hurt me a lot, but honestly i’ve accepted the situation. To move forward, I’m going to block you. I’m sick of waiting for a response that may not even ever come. I️ wish you were direct instead of always beating around the bush or dismissing things. 


btw, I️ was talking about how you rejected me at the coffee shop and how I️ was confused because prior to meeting we made jokes how I️ was going to wear lingerie the next time that I️ saw you. I️ wasn’t talking about you romantically rejecting me, and I️ was saying how I️ wont take it personal if you just communicated so I️ wouldn’t be confused.


This is all I️ have to say. I️ hope you heal and seek out support.


Tl;dr every time I️ would try to confront him or ask about where our relationship stands he would ghost me. A week prior to meeting going home for thanksgiving we had a very romantic night. I️ then saw him the day I️ got back and he was very cold to me and didn’t even hug or kiss me hello or goodbye. I️ then invited him to my house and he said no. I️ asked him why after I️ left via text and he said “not everything has to be sexual”… we planned a day where I️ would wear lingerie when I️ got back from my travels.. He then cancelled our hang out a few days later. I️ tried to call him for clarity and he rejected the call and hasn’t messaged me in over ten days.",1,1734187474.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1he46l1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1he46l1/welcome_to_the_starlight_inn_3/,Welcome to the Starlight Inn - 3,"Hey there! It has been a minute! Sorry about that, it's been a bit of a busy week and a half for me. After my colossal fuck-up last week, Isaac decided I needed a *partner*, someone to keep an eye on things, and more importantly; me. Their name is Van, and so far, they seem like the only normal part of this place. It was considerably surprising to find out literally anyone else worked here, to be perfectly honest with you. They studied business and management at the University of Oregon, play guitar sorta well, and literally NEVER. STOP. TALKING.

Don't mistake me, having someone along for this fucking weird ride has been really nice, but holy SHIT. I'm a generally reserved person, I feel I'm at my best when I only speak when something needs to be said, or if I'm making small talk. Their conversations could hardly be described as small talk, for instance, last night, I got to hear a literal uninterrupted 45 minutes hearing about the lore surrounding a game called Detroit: Become Human. What's upsetting about this isn't that they rambled for 45 minutes about it, but rather by the time that rambling ended I was INVESTED!

Uncharacteristically, however, was how little they actually had to say about what pushed them to start working here, or really any details about their employment. When I asked them about the rules Isaac laid out for me on my first day, the only thing they had to say about it was ""Yeah, they're pretty weird"". All things considered, though? It's been nice having someone around. Something no one seems to consider (or at the very least, ***I*** never considered) about working overnight shifts entirely on your own is the... well... loneliness of it. There's a certain feeling of isolation sitting behind a desk for countless hours a week with your only conversations being the occasional conversation with a guest. Having this new face around, I think it's made this job a little bit more bearable. Not to say there still hasn't been batshit crazy things going on, of course!

Two nights ago, for instance, we had the same guest check in 12 different times. Now when you hear this you may think I mean they had booked 12 rooms, no, I mean I would check them into a room, and then 20 minutes later they would walk in through the door, and it was as if they had never even been here until that moment. I checked them into room 505 TWELVE FUCKING TIMES. After the 8th I had to ask if they were fucking with me.

Something else I should note about this place is that our coffee maker has been broken pretty much my entire time working here. I usually bring my own sustenance but occasionally I'll find I've forgotten to put an energy drink or six into my backpack, and MAN that coffee maker would have come in real handy on those nights. I've emailed Isaac via the email I've found in our employee registry no less than ten times about it over my employment here. He never responds.

Van asks a lot of questions about me, too. If I grew up here, if I've been out of town for things like studies, if I'm in a relationship, how my relationship is with my family, etc. It makes me a little uncomfortable if I'm being perfectly honest, but given how forthcoming they are with their own life story, I feel it's only fair I indulge them, although I'm not NEARLY as open as they are. I think they know, they get this certain look on their face when I give a half-assed answer, and they've made it a point to call me out on it. I decided today I'd turn it into a game.

""I'll answer fully if you start answering some of my questions fully, you get a point if you flat out refuse to answer."" and they agreed.

They asked if I was in a relationship, I said ""No, in a town where everyone knows everyone, I hold zero desire to look at romance, it comes with FAR too much drama""

They seemed satisfied with that answer, so I asked them:

""Exactly how long have you worked here? This place seemed to just pop up out of the blue, and as far as I could tell, I was the only employee on staff for the front desk aside from our *glorious* leader.""

They paused for a moment before answering. ""Isaac found my resume on Indeed about a year ago"", they started.

""He stated he was in need of staffing for this hotel that he managed out in the sticks, and I had just finished my Bachelor's, I was desperate to get out of Eugene, so I agreed. I was given a room here, it's basically a studio apartment, it's entirely paid for and I get paid well enough that I don't really think about it all too much.""

Well, that explains why they aren't surprised by the rules.

They then asked me if I ever thought about leaving Maelstrom Hills. ""I have, truthfully. The idea still sits pretty firm in my brain, but I feel like I can't. The Hills are all I know, and truthfully, I'm scared of changes that drastic. I don't know where I'd go or what I'd do. I don't exactly have many marketable skills, and save for our creepy ass security guards and our occasional guests, I don't mind this job too much""

They looked at me, almost confused. ""But aren't you curious about what's out there? Surely you've gotta be bored of the monotony!""

I paused for a minute, because honestly? I've never looked at leaving the Hills that seriously before.

""Yeah, I am. And maybe once I find some time to go and pursue those curiosities, I will. But for now, I gotta stay put""

My phone cut off the surprisingly deep conversation I was having with this person I had just barely had the opportunity to really get to know, it's 7 AM. Otherwise known as time for us to part ways for the day.

""Quittin' time! I'll see you later!"" I shouted, half-way out the door.

On the morning of 12/12/24 i was reading the news about the ""drones"" and all the other places people have been seeing strange things in the sky and I looked toward my balcony door.

After I finished making my coffee I decided i’m gonna go out check out the sky for myself and do my due diligence as a citizen lol.

I walk outside, close the door and look up to see the most brilliantly luminous star i’ve ever seen… and then it started moving.  
I am an avid sky watcher and live near many airports, i can spot the difference.   
this UFO was at least 4-500 feet up. 100% not a satellite, plane or chopper.   
this wasn't an aircraft; it was a floating ball of light.

The sky above me is know as the DC FRZ (Flight Restricted Zone) and is one of the if not the single most controlled airspace on earth, drones are illegal to fly here.  
This happened about 1.5 miles from the Pentagon and under a mile from the White House. The object was travelling east.

There was only one corse of action to save the dying colony. Declare war on its neighbors. 

After the first cease fire the coalition was firmly and steadily against any attempt to approach the colony’s borders leading them to making city states surrounding the colony’s territory which gives them access to the Nalhil Keepers the main eleven faction within the united Dwarven and Elven coalition. All kingdoms of the race are part of the coalition but some are superpowers and others are city states.

After a whole season of waiting, mining the reserves, training the children and women, in the month of Crabuary, war is declared on Lyl Qona with no active legions left the citizenry advances into enemy territory and fortified positions, sweeping deep into their heartland.
Hearing news of the invasion in the month of Greguary the Nalhil king demands the 4th and 5th legions take control of last settlement of Lyl Qona, preventing further expansion for the colony and limiting gains fighting against time to integrate the newly conquered lands before their neighbors Ydom, which seeing an opportunity to expand their borders takes it, and advances.
The war officially ends in 745.

For 20 years the world of Odanē holds the peace until driven by more desires for territorial gains they declare war once again, this time upon Ydom.
After the First World War on Odane the worlds native kingdom, its first super power was eclipsed by the Nalhili's superior integration methods as well as industrialization capabilities and available resources, once the total hegemony of Odane, now the little brother of their own little brother. An alliance was formed between the colony and the kingdom to prevent the kingdoms numbers from getting to out of control, if both fought then they would Both win. But if one left the alliance both would be colonized.
With total security on its northern border and a small sea port the colony felt it was time once again to expand the empires gains.

The order is given. The legions start to mobilize and on the month of Joon war is declared on the neighboring kingdom of Ydom. Within 3 month the city falls. And all that stands between the empire and Odanē is the last super power the Nalhili Keepers.

In a shocking display of shock and awe the keepers move into the newly conquered lands and establish once again, sister republics, which serve as a buffer zone and surveillance state. The keepers have thousands of citizens to throw at the human problem, the humans only have 500 people left on their colony.

Oda who is the current king of the empires throne, has only been emperor for 2 years now. His reign is one of conquests and exploits, but unlike his predecessors, us unwilling to throw thousands of soldiers and citizenry at the coalition to hope for a breakthrough.
So in the second month of his reign after news of Former Emperor Penikug’s death reached the interior palace, all aid to the colony is halted, and one order is given, take half of all the land for more resources to arrive.
The emperor has officially declared that the colony was a lost cause, unfit and unwilling to lead the expedition himself all funds allocated to the construction of the new armada, the new navy academy, the new navy uniforms and issued weapons were all directed and diverted to other areas of the empire.
This would proof fatal to the emperor.
The coalition has never demilitarized the local space around Odanē keeping it heavily guarded and with hourly patrols, this took 2 thousand Evelin soldiers to enforce at any given time. Meaning the actual ground forces of these kingdoms would be relatively low and small compared to the large forces the empire was used to fighting. 
Initially Regis takes a diplomatic approach like with the Odanē kingdom offers of alliance and cooperation are floated around and some of the smaller states accept immediately others take a few months but ultimately give in once they see a counter coalition form from the city states implemented by the keepers. Meant to fight them as well.
The only ones who decline are the ones who divided our territory in the 3rd world war. And are quickly integrated into the empire. With no resistance and unconditional support from her ally’s the colony goes on the offensive yet again, a year after losing all her gains, after destroying the standing population to 200 citizens, after demolishing her city’s.
The Odanē kingdoms king is the one who actually suggests open war, and so it is declared all of her ally’s turn on her and now they close in, starting in crabuary and ending in Joon the former super power is reduced to 60 citizens on land and 2 thousand troops in the sky.
Unable to coordinate with the ground forces the navy is stuck in space; while the Odanē kingdom bypasses the colony and takes all the territory lost from the keepers. A grave betrayal so in the month of Endember all the alliance forces agree to dissolve it with a 3 year peace treaty following.
A smart move for the small colony with 2 thousand of the coalitions forces steaming to Odanē, news has reached the navy. 
Their king has fallen, their kingdom is a single city reduced from a great empire. With a dose of mushrooms and coffee they prepare for a second offensive, unwilling to accept their situation.",3,1734186087.0,Worldbox,0,1.0,False

I took a break from working to focus on making a pivot into corporate law. I have been trying to make this change since August with no luck. I’ve spoken to about 8 different recruiters who’ve told me that they can’t help me since their clients are adamant about finding people with direct experience. I have exhausted my contacts, I have had countless phone calls, coffee chats, etc. and it seems like no one wants to give me a shot. Seems like being a lawyer isn’t enough - I need experience in the field. Feeling really stuck and would appreciate any advice and/or connections you may have. Primarily open to positions in Toronto but also open to looking elsewhere.

Thanks!",3,1734186035.0,LawCanada,4,1.0,False

I live in NW Washington DC (Foggy Bottom) & I’ve been seeing strange lights in the sky here for weeks now but nobody believes me!

On the morning of 12/12/24 i was reading the news about the ""drones"" and all the other places people have been seeing strange things in the sky and I looked toward my balcony door.

After I finished making my coffee I decided i’m gonna go out check out the sky for myself and do my due diligence as a citizen lol.

I walk outside, close the door and look up to see the most brilliantly luminous star i’ve ever seen… and then it started moving.  
I am an avid sky watcher and live near many airports, i can spot the difference.   
this UFO was at least 4-500 feet up. 100% not a satellite, plane or chopper.   
this wasn't an aircraft; it was a floating ball of light.

The sky above me is know as the DC FRZ (Flight Restricted Zone) and is one of the if not the single most controlled airspace on earth, drones are illegal to fly here.  
This happened about 1.5 miles from the Pentagon and under a mile from the White House. The object was travelling east.

got my phone out as fast as possible. flight data on my page and at the end of video.  
thanks for reading.

Benefits - easy, simple, you (almost) can't screw it up! I also like its unfussy, casual vibe, spooned into a bowl. 

Ingredient swaps - I used a cup of hot coffee instead of boiling water and highly recommend. 

Drawbacks aka how I did manage to screw it up a little - 30 mins at 350 was way too much time. I recently got a new oven and I'm not used to it yet. But even so I'd dial that time back maybe even 10 whole minutes. Also, this is a cake that should be served pretty promptly after it comes out of the oven and rests briefly. I was googling around and read that self-saucing cakes soak their sauce back into the cake the more you let them sit. That was definitely my experience. We had company and got to talking and the timeline for dinner was a little elastic. When I spooned into the cake, it had soaked up most of the sauce. 

Next time, I'd just put this in the oven when we sat down to eat the main course. No one was mad about hot chocolate cake in a bowl with ice cream, but I was really missing that sauce. ",3,1734185744.0,NYTCooking,1,1.0,False

You start your game dev journey thinking ""I'll make a small indie game!"" and suddenly you're... *checks notes* ...buying out your competitors, creating your own console, and running a digital empire across multiple studios.

City Game Studio is basically what happens when a game dev's daydream during their 9-to-5 job becomes an actual game. From renting a tiny office to cracking competitors' games (totally ethical, right?), this game lets you live out every unrealistic dev fantasy short of having a healthy work-life balance.

The best part? It was made by one person, which means they probably lived on coffee and dreams while creating a game about building a massive gaming empire. The irony is *chef's kiss*.

I will type it out I'm thirty-two typing this. 


It isn't words on art that I can't. I am fine with words on art.

 Some art has words on it. 

Some art has no words on it.

 For the art I own ever that does have words on it; I am fine with the words as long as the words on the art goes to who I am; matches and goes. 

It is the signatures that I can't. 


Again... Some art has words on it. Some art has no words on it.

...and for both kinds... Like; if you put a signature on the art; now you can't see the art anymore; it is ruined all because a part of it has; had to be covered up by a signature. 

I have a bottle cap retro coffee clock with hands anolog. It has coffee words on it. But because I drink and love coffee; I'm fine with the words as it has to do with me and goes. There isn't a signature on it. I'm glad. If there was a signature on it; I wouldn't like it because you can't see that part of it; as it is being hidden by the signature. 

See?

But what about copywrite stuff? 

First off, why do I want someone; somebody else's name on my wall? 

Second... I get it. Unless you have a bunch of it all; copies; in the world;  to the point where like who cares if someone removes the signature and replaces with the color it was in the spot before the signature got put and you'll be dead at some point... I get it. 

But...

Also... 

Just do what is done with such as the Mona Lisa and have a plaque or something underneath it. 

What about the back?

No. The back is still part of the art just the back of it. ...and some art goes all sides and angles. Not all art is one sided paint stuff.
