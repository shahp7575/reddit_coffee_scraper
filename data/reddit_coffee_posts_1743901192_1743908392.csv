1jskhs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jskhs0/home_automatic_espresso_machine_recommendations/,Home Automatic espresso machine recommendations? [$200],"Hello friends

I am looking to buy an espresso machine as a gift for a friend. And usually I like to research a lot before I do so as to get a good product. I know they want an espresso machine and they were looking for one. But I came across this subreddit and went into the espresso ideal pressure rabbit hole. I will go into details on this at the end for whoever wants to have a look at what I have been suffering from :).



Basically, I am looking for what you espresso folks and experts would consider is a good budget ($100 to $200) espresso machine, fully automatic that takes Coffee Powder.

For example DeLonghi Dedica EC685 priced at around $150

And if im understanding correctly, Ideally it should have an OPV so that the pressure remains consistent at around 9 Bars which for example the DeLonghi machine I mentioned lacks.
However, all the machines I have found also don't mention an OPV so most likely they don't have one. So if thats the case, shouldn't a 15 Bar machine be better than a 20 since the 15 is still closer to the approperiate pressure range for espresso? I know that the machine internally doesn't brew at 15 or 20 bars as that is the advertised peak pressure, but without an OPV, the machine in theory would start off near the highest pressure and go down to align around the appropriate range, so starting at around 15 is better than starting at around 20 for a good espresso.






Espresso Pressure Rabbit Hole: the 9 Bar requirement messed me up. Because why are all machines 15 Bar and 20 Bar, and the higher the Bar the more expensive. And it turns out its all advertising and marketing strategy, because ""higher pressure= better"" which is as all you guys pointed out is not the case.


But then I found out that no these automatic machines don't brew at their ""15"" or ""20"" Bar advertisements, internally they brew at around 7-11 Bar, but the 15 or 20 Bar title is their maximum capacity. But then still, these same machines, if they lack an OPV, when first brewing, they might start at their highest capable pressure and start going down from there, so they start around for example 20 Bar, and then go down to the proper range.


And then when you think about it, if I am brewing at 15 Bar, its better than brewing at 20 Bar. So if I have 2 options, between 2 machines, one 15 and one 20 and both without OPV, so both would start around their peak pressure and go down. It would be better to start around 15 than 20. So the cheaper 15 Bar machines in theory are the better machines than the 20 Bar ones.",1,1743908271.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I (22F) started an internship a few months ago, and only a couple of weeks after that, another new intern joined. For reasons that particularly escape me, *I* was tasked with training *her.* We are around the same age, and have a similar sense of humor, so we hit it off pretty well. 

A few days ago, my internship ended, and she... Almost started weeping, to say the least. She promised to treat me to a meal (all is well until now) and then handed me a parting gift. It's such a sweet gesture, I thank her a lot, buy her coffee and hug her goodbye. Then, when I get home, I open the gift bag, and it's a perfume, two body mists, a heartfelt letter and *money.* 

First of all... Perfume?! I'm so so grateful, I wasn't expecting to get such an expensive gift, and on top of that she got me exactly the type of perfume I like, which I believe I only mentioned in passing. The best part is, the body mists are red fruits flavored, which is exactly the flavor of tea I had every day. Isn't that the most thoughtful thing ever?? The money part I am quite frankly confused about. Maybe the cashier put her change in a gift bag on accident? The letter was very sweet, but I am overall confused. 

It could be my own emotional constipation talking! But is this a normal gesture between colleagues who have only known each other for a month and a half? All my other colleagues just said goodbye with the 'appropriate' amount of fanfare. Don't get me wrong, I am *very* appreciative and would by no means imply something negative about it. I just want to understand better! 

  
Additional context that might help? 

While we had the same nationality, she did not grow up in the country. She grew up in China and studied in Turkey. Perhaps it's a cultural thing? 

She *can* speak the native language but she prefers to communicate in English, and I was the only other person who could speak it fluently. 

She called me her girl crush (I'm getting a warning from reddit so I want emphasize that this is not me seeking relationship advice or anything of the sort, really just want to understand !) and had really high praise for me all the time. Sometimes a little too much? 

If anyone can give me an insight, if maybe I should start gifting my colleagues perfumes as well T\^T? ",1,1743907914.0,CasualConversation,0,1.0,False

I want to warn other women. (TW: sexual assault)","I’ve gone back and forth about sharing this. It’s been almost a year, and I’ve spent that time trying to heal, trying to move on. But I don’t think I ever truly will. And if speaking up can stop someone else from going through what I did, then it’s worth it.

In March 2024, while traveling in Tokyo, I was raped.

It’s still hard to say that word, even though I know that’s what happened. I’ve replayed the night over and over, trying to find a moment where I could have changed things. But the truth is, the only person responsible is him.

I was in Japan with friends—first Osaka, then Tokyo, the last stretch of what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime. We’d just finished a night exploring Shibuya when we met a group of Americans drinking outside. A goth-looking girl barely said ""hey"" before disappearing. One guy, Matt, struck up a conversation and said he could show us around the local ""emo bars"" the next night. He seemed friendly and outgoing. I don’t use Instagram or Facebook, so I gave him my phone number.

We were texting back and forth. When we finally met a few weeks later, my friends were too tired to go out, so I met him alone in Shibuya. When I arrived at Rockaholic, he wasn’t with any friends. Matt did all the talking. At the bar, he showed me pictures of what he said was his two-bedroom apartment with a recording studio and a cat. It looked clean and cozy—totally normal.

I had one rum and coke. He bought me another.

The next thing I remember is waking up completely naked on the floor of a filthy room. No mattress, no pillow, no blanket—just a pile of my clothes near some guitar equipment. The only furniture in the place was a dirty fridge, a TV stand with no TV, and a single bed. I had no idea where I was, but later found out it was in Chiba—far from where we started. A different prefecture altogether, and not Suginami like he’d said.

He was in the bed, fully clothed, weird TV static music playing. My phone was on charge.

I felt sick. Disoriented. Violated.

I didn’t remember getting there. I didn’t remember undressing. I didn’t consent.

When I asked what happened, he smiled and said we got drunk and had sex. I told him I didn’t consent. That he raped me. He tried to play it off, tried to put his arm around me, told me I ""shouldn’t worry"" because he didn’t come inside me and had ""cleaned me up.""

I have flashbacks of him cleaning himself off my stomach. That moment haunts me. I never said yes. I never had a chance to say anything at all.

I just wanted to get away. I grabbed my things and told him I was heading to the station. Instead, I went to the nearest convenience store, bought a coffee to calm my nerves, googled where I was. Then figured the best way back to the hostel.

Later, he sent me a picture of my necklace—one I’d looked for before I left. I know he kept it intentionally. A manipulation tactic. A way to lure me back.

When I got back to the UK, I went straight to my local NHS clinic. I was tested for everything. I was raped, and because of him, I tested positive for HSV-1 and HSV-2. A lifelong reminder.

I should have gone to the police. I should have done a lot of things. But at the time, I just wanted to feel safe again.

His name is **Matt** from LA, probably around 46 years old, though he looks older. He has a band called **FaveRiot**. When I looked him up through a friend’s account, I saw him wearing my necklace in one of his band photos. I felt used all over again.

i want to help other women and warn others. Where is best to share my story?

(again, so wrong.) i released the shift an hour before i was supposed to show up. during my shifts there, the two hosts that were with me kind of used me as a busser/seat people instead of teaching me the right way to rotate servers and when it’s best to start the wait list etc. i assumed my presence wouldn’t make the slightest of difference, im brand new and just a trainee. of course calling out of a shift this early on with any employer gives you an awful look, and honestly looking back on it i wish i would have shown up, just to be useless and remain in the restroom but at least i showed. about an hour and a half after 12, i get a call from the restaurant. it’s the same manager that hired me. he was.. extremely angry to say the least. “why did you not call?” “it’s common sense to call.” “i’m gonna give you a write up for this.” “im disappointed you didn’t have the common sense to call even when you’re new” (and way way more.) all of this with the most tone i have ever heard from a grown man. while i agree with me having better common sense, and yes it absolutely was very dumb to assume the little app thingy was enough, this whole restaurant thing might not be for my overly sensitive self. im the type of person to think about one interaction for DAYS on end if i was yelled at. he asked if i was coming in the next day, i said no and told him the next day im scheduled. it sounded like a threat when he told me he’ll see me then. i’ve now here’s the huge kicker. when i interviewed with him, he hired me on the spot. i wish i saw the red flag. as i mentioned before i have another job. but this one is a family owned spot, where their employees have been there since the place opened. i’m kinda there to fill in the hours that the main crew isn’t available. that’s usually around 10 hours a week, sometimes more if im filling in. with chilis, the manager told me id be starting at 25-30 hours a week starting. key word. starting. the schedule after my mandatory training hours? 4. four hours for the next two week out schedule. with this place, i’m losing more than i have at my original job. and since i THOUGHT i was gonna have a consistent schedule with chilis, i gave my og job specific days id be able to work for them, since i didnt have a huge schedule there anyway. i feel bad for wasting these people’s time, but after that phone call i deeply feel i was never meant to be there. maybe im just not used to corporations being more.. blunt? again i 100000% know and believe my mistake and fully recognize he’s right about not taking the step to call. but being spoken to the way i was makes me afraid to show up again. if im not even getting the hours i was told, and i had more before i cut them FOR THIS PLACE.. is it even worth it to stay? here i was thinking i landed a balanced work schedule in this shitty job market.. just to deal with this. is this normal in the restaurant industry? very rude managers? i feel i won’t stay there very long. i’ll update as time goes on, we’ll see if i even show up for the next shift. life is far too short to deal with meanies like this. i live in a big city, im sure there’s another opportunity for me somewhere. but here? not for me.. we’ll see.

## Bose QuietComfort 20 in 2025: A Detailed​ Review

Let's assess the ⁤ *Bose QuietComfort 20 acoustic noise ⁢cancelling‍ headphones* in the context of 2025,considering advancements in technology ⁤and evolving user needs.

**Noise Cancellation:** The QC20’s *active noise cancelling headphones* were excellent for⁣ their time,⁤ and⁤ still ‍perform well. The depth⁤ of noise reduction ​is still notable. However, newer ⁣headphones, particularly those with advanced digital signal processing, offer even⁤ more refined cancellation, often targeting specific ‌frequency ranges more effectively. Considering *ANC headphones*,⁢ the QC20 holds its own, but isn't the leader anymore.

**Sound Quality:** While​ subjective, most⁢ reviews praise the QC20's balanced sound signature, making them ⁢suitable for various genres. The *bose ⁣quietcomfort 20 sound quality* is still considered⁤ very good, ​even though perhaps a little ‌less detailed compared to some newer audiophile-focused options.‌ Enthusiasts may find alternatives​ providing a wider sound stage and crisper detail,but for many,the QC20s offer a pleasant and versatile listening experience.

**Comfort and Fit:** The ear tips are designed for comfort, and most users find them suitable for extended ⁣listening sessions. Though, fit is⁣ always⁢ personal, and some may prefer other designs.

**Features and Functionality:** The ""Aware Mode"" remains a useful‌ feature for situational awareness. Though, the QC20⁤ lacks modern ⁢features such as Bluetooth connectivity, customizable ‍EQ settings, and advanced voice assistant integration, all common in ​newer *bose headphones* and competing models. It is a wired ⁤ *wired⁤ noise cancelling headphones* model.

**Durability and Reliability:** The *QuietComfort headphones* line is generally ​known for its build quality,but ⁣the QC20 is showing its age. The cables are a potential point of failure, ⁢and ⁣users may need to source *bose quietcomfort 20 replacement parts* ‍ or ⁤ *bose quietcomfort 20 repair* services ⁢over time.

**Price⁢ and Availability:** Given their‌ age, finding new *Bose QuietComfort 20 acoustic noise cancelling headphones* can be challenging. They​ are often available ‌on the *bose⁢ qc20 sale* market sold *used bose quietcomfort 20* ‍or *refurbished bose qc20* options.

## Alternatives to the Bose QuietComfort⁤ 20: What Are Your Options in 2025?

If *where ⁢to buy bose qc20* ⁢ is becoming increasingly difficult,⁤ or if you're looking for something more modern ⁣with enhanced features, here are some⁣ alternatives to consider, categorized by user need:

**For the Business Traveler:**

   **Sony WH-1000XM5:** Considered ⁤by many to be the current gold standard in noise cancellation, offering exceptional performance⁤ and features​ like speak-to-chat and ‍multipoint connectivity.
   **Bose QuietComfort Headphones (Over-Ear):** The over-ear version of the quietcomfort line provides stellar noise cancellation​ and‌ a comfortable design for long flights.

**For the Student:**

*   **Anker Soundcore Life Q30:** Delivers excellent noise cancellation and sound quality⁢ at a very affordable‍ price point.⁣ A strong for *affordable noise cancelling headphones.
   **JBL Tune 760NC:** Another budget-friendly option with​ decent noise cancellation⁤ and a comfortable over-ear design.

**For the Commuter:**

*   **Technics‌ EAH-AZ80:** these‍ earbuds boast excellent noise cancellation, ⁢a comfortable​ fit, and long battery life, making them ideal for daily commutes.*   **OnePlus Buds 3 :** Great value, effective ​noise‍ cancelling, ⁣and compact ‍charging case

**For the Audio ⁤Enthusiast on ⁣a Budget:**

   **Earfun Free Pro 3:** These earbuds⁢ offer surprisingly good noise cancellation and​ sound quality for their price, making them a ⁢great budget-friendly option.
Used QC20 or refurbished Bose earbuds (consider conditions)

## Conclusion: the QC20's Legacy and Future

The *Bose QuietComfort 20* undeniably left a lasting mark on the world of *noise cancelling earbuds* and *headphones⁤ with ‍noise cancellation*. They pushed⁢ the boundaries of noise ⁣cancellation in a portable format and set a ⁤benchmark for future generations.

However, technology has advanced significantly since their initial release. While the QC20 still offers competent noise cancellation and decent​ sound quality, their age and lack ⁤of modern features make them less competitive⁤ against newer ​models.

For those seeking a reliable and affordable noise cancelling solution, particularly if found at a meaningful *bose quietcomfort 20 discount*, a *used bose quietcomfort 20*, or *refurbished bose qc20*, the QC20 may still be a viable option.

Ultimately, the best​ choice depends on individual needs and preferences. weighing the features, performance, and price of the *Bose QuietComfort 20* against modern alternatives will help you determine if these iconic ​headphones still hold ‍their own in the evolving world of audio technology in 2025. If you have considered⁣ the *bose quietcomfort 20 price* and ‍features, there may be modern alternatives that may be more⁣ suited⁤ to your needs. Remember to⁤ seek out real user reviews to help‌ with the decision making process.

1jsk6b5,https://www.reddit.com/r/n8n/comments/1jsk6b5/need_help_building_this_willing_to_pay/,Need help building this. Willing to pay.,"Hey Reddit,

I’m working on a project where I’m building a **highly realistic Twitter bot network** using **n8n**, **Puppeteer**, and **GPT** — all running locally on a dedicated laptop.

Speed doesn’t matter — I’m prioritizing realism, variability, and stealth.

Here’s what I’m aiming to build and what I could use help with.

# The Core Idea

I want to control **50–100 Twitter accounts**, each acting like a real person.

Each bot will:

* Log in individually (no Twitter API — browser-based only using Puppeteer)
* Scroll through their feed
* Like posts
* Occasionally retweet or follow accounts
* Post their own tweets randomly (including text + image tweets)
* Stay logged in for a random amount of time (between 1–10 minutes)
* Log out and rotate to the next account

This bot loop runs **from 6 a.m. to 1 a.m. every day**, simulating sleep during off hours.

# Manual Tweet Trigger (Main Account)

Whenever I manually tweet something from my **main account**, I’ll trigger a webhook in n8n.

That webhook will:

* Store the tweet text + link
* Initiate an **engagement wave** from a random group of bots that will:
   * Mostly **like** the tweet
   * Some **retweet** it
   * A few **reply or quote tweet** it

Replies will be generated **contextually via GPT** using the actual tweet content.

# Reply Workflow

When replying to the main account:

1. The bot reads the tweet text.
2. GPT generates a reply based on the tweet **and the bot’s personality**.
3. The bot posts the reply via Puppeteer (browser control).

# Image Tweeting System

Some bots will also post their own original tweets with photos.

The system will:

1. Grab a random image from a local folder
2. Use GPT to describe the image
3. Re-prompt GPT to write a caption for the photo
4. Tweet the image + caption
5. Delete the image from the folder after use to prevent duplication

# Anti-Detection Measures

* Bots reuse **saved login cookies** to avoid repeated logins and security prompts
* Using **stealth plugins** and headless Chromium fingerprint spoofing (user-agent, timezone, screen size, etc.)
* Each bot uses a **dedicated proxy/static IP** to avoid shared-VPN detection
* Bots engage in **non-main account activity** as well (liking trending posts, following accounts, replying to niche tweets)

# Advanced Features I’m Implementing

Here’s where the fun really starts — I’m layering in complexity to make these bots more believable:

# 1. Bot Personalities

Each bot has its own:

* Tone (playful, chill, sarcastic, poetic)
* Interests (dogs, coffee, tech, memes, food, etc.)
* Emoji usage level
* Reply style (casual, dramatic, minimalist)
* Fake timezone (used to limit “awake” hours)

Personalities will guide GPT responses and behavior patterns.

# 2. Bot-to-Bot Engagement

Bots will:

* Follow each other
* Occasionally reply to or quote tweet each other
* Build micro “communities” to simulate real friend groups or followers

# 3. Cooldowns and Suspicion Limits

Each bot will:

* Track its last like / RT / reply time
* Follow cooldown logic so it doesn’t over-engage
* Get temporarily paused if flagged or if an error occurs (e.g., CAPTCHA)

# 4. Fake Timezone Schedules

Each bot has its own fake timezone (e.g., GMT+2, GMT-5)

It only runs sessions when it’s “awake” in its timezone

Adds realism and naturally staggers engagement waves

# 5. Post-Like Decay Logic

Bots will:

* Prioritize liking tweets within the first 2 hours after they're posted
* Scale down likes/replies/RTs after 12–24h

This makes main account tweet engagement look more organic

# 6. Internal Dashboard (n8n-powered)

I’ll be tracking:

* Which bots are active or on cooldown
* What tweets each bot engaged with
* Error logs (e.g., login failures, blocked actions)
* Manual override controls (to force engagement mode, pause accounts, etc.)

# 7. Event-Based Surges

Bots will temporarily increase engagement based on:

* Keywords in tweets (e.g., “giveaway”, “drop”, “launch”)
* Specific time triggers (e.g., Friday night, product drop window)

# What I Could Use Help With

If you’ve ever worked with Puppeteer, n8n, GPT, or any sort of stealth automation — I’d love your input on:

* How to structure workflows cleanly (centralized or per-bot?)
* How to manage Puppeteer cookies per bot inside n8n
* Assigning unique proxies per bot in a scalable way
* Best practices for image deletion + storage
* Any known quirks with Puppeteer + Twitter that I should plan around

Click Here to Learn How to Earn With Woodworking: https://app.leadcreator.ai/bu0xk8tha4  
  
- **Determine the Size:** Measure the space where the table will go. Ensure there’s enough room around it for chairs or movement.
- **Choose the Style:** Decide on the aesthetic you want—modern, rustic, or traditional. This will guide your choice of materials and design.
- **Sketch Your Ideas:** Draw rough diagrams to visualize your design. This will help in understanding proportions and layout.

### Materials Required for Table Crafting

Choosing the right materials is key to successful table crafting. Here’s a list of common materials you might consider:

- **Wood:** Hardwood like oak or maple is often preferred for durability, while pine is a great choice if you’re looking for a more affordable option.
- **Metal:** For a modern look, metal legs or accents can enhance the design.
- **Finishes:** Stains, paints, or sealants can protect and beautify your table.

### Essential Tools You'll Need

To bring your table design to life, it’s essential to have the right tools. Here’s a list of must-have equipment:

- **Drill:** Use it for making holes for screws and dowels.
- **Sander:** To smooth surfaces and edges, achieving a polished finish.
- **Clamps:** To hold pieces together while the glue dries.

### Step-by-Step Crafting Techniques

Now, let’s get into the crafting process. Here’s a simplified step-by-step guide to help you create your custom table:

#### 1. Cutting the Wood

Using your saw, cut the top, legs, and any support beams according to your sketch. Measure twice before cutting to avoid mistakes.

Once the base is complete, position the tabletop and attach it using screws. Don’t forget to double-check alignment!

### Adding Personal Touches

To make your table truly unique, consider adding personal touches. Here are some ideas:

- **Carvings:** If you are skilled in wood carving, adding designs or patterns can enhance aesthetics.

- **Different Finishes:** Experiment with distressing techniques for a rustic look, or a high-gloss finish for a modern touch.

### Safety Measures to Keep in Mind

Woodworking can present certain risks, so your safety should always be a priority. Here are some essential precautions:

- **Wear Eye Protection:** Always wear safety goggles when working with power tools.
- **Work in a Well-Ventilated Area:** This is especially important when using finishes or glues.

My reason for wanting the role is that I know I could do the job very well without being stressed, it was only 30 hours/week, pay is good for the remote area I work in, location was nearby, hybrid was offered. If I had landed the job, my plan was to stay with the company for at least 5 years.

During the initial interview they pointed out the more menial aspects of the job - making coffee, tidying up lunchroom, stocking employee snacks, making runs to post office, picking up catering, etc. I said I was good with doing all of that.

I get asked to come in for a 2nd interview scheduled for 2 hours 30 minutes. As part of it, I’m asked to do a 30 minute PowerPoint showcasing my presentation & technical skills. There’s also a 30 minute Excel test. This seemed to not be in line with the way they described the bulk of the job, so I think there must be more to it and really put a lot of effort into the presentation which I was told was great. Shortly afterwards they bring up the more menial job aspects again to double check that I’m okay with them.

I did not get the job and was given no feedback. I felt like I would have had a better chance if I had presented myself as more basic and not discussed my more significant achievements. I found it confusing that on the one hand they were implying the job is not that technical, but on the other hands have this intense interview process.

Figured this would be the perfect place to ask!

I've been a Nespresso pod person for quite some time now, however, not only do I feel like I'm wasting a ton of money on 7.77ml pods / I'm also making like 3 to 4 of these pods per day (also, the lack of flavored choices for the Vertuo leaves alot to be desired).

That's when I started looking up coffee machines. I would not consider myself a coffee-expert/snob/connoisseur/what have you. I can go to Dunkin' and be happy... my coffee usually has a few splenda and a boat load of creamer.

I love the look of the Moccamaster KGBV Select and have read that it's a quality product - justifying the price tag. **However, is the Moccamaster overkill for me (Mr. Splenda)?** I don't plan on grinding beans - I'd be ordering pre-ground Bones Coffee Co. (such interesting flavors).

In essence, by using pre-ground coffee and dumping a bunch of splenda and cream into my coffee - would :

A) The moccamaster be able to use pre-ground coffee (bones coffee co)?  
B) Would I notice the difference from a cheaper machine?

Let me know what ya think...

Also recently saw the KRUPS Essential Brewer (SCA-Certified), similar look and substantially less expensive - Anyone use this machine? [https://a.co/d/ayVPBlC](https://a.co/d/ayVPBlC)",2,1743905920.0,Moccamaster,6,1.0,False

Today I went on a long walk (7k steps), before that I had artichoke tea + iron vitamins, and after the walk I had breakfast with my mom at a coffee shop and drank coffee ate a turkey, manchego and lettuce sandwich, that was around 9am. Then came back home, and didn’t eat anything until lunch(2:30pm). I had a small salad (spinach, romaine, cherry tomatoes, avocado and cucumber with lemon juice) + 2 baked chicken tenders sliced in small cubes with a tiny bit of bbq on top + a Diet Coke. 4 hours after that I went on a shorter walk (3k steps), came back and had blueberries with Greek yogurt, cinnamon tea, a spoonful of honey with lemon because my throat is a bit sore.  And 1 leftover chicken tender.

I ate under my calorie deficit and I feel super full, I didn’t have any extra snacks. And it was my most active day of the week but also the one I ate the least amount of calories.

1jsjs5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTpGentleman/comments/1jsjs5p/tpg_episode_review_coach_makes_jimmy_an_offer_he/,TPG Episode Review - Coach Makes Jimmy an Offer He Can't Refuse!!,"This is a pivotal episode in TPG lore as it is the official ""fake"" agreement for Jimmy to become partner in Coach's ponzi. 

6:18 Coach commends Jimmy on working for free. Jimmy responds by saying ""you gotta see the process before you jump in."" Very eerie.

7:20 Coach reveals he offered Jimmy a full time job as an Operations Manager with a generous salary. Jimmy, sticking to the script and illusion of said salary, reiterates that the salary is ""very generous."" 

9:40 Coach asks Jimmy what it would take, money wise, for him to jump ship from being a teller to working full time for TPG. 

Jimmy responds with a muted answer. We're gonna need a Jomboy lip read for this one fellas. Wouldn't be surprised if he didn't say anything at all as this is possibly scripted. Both Jimmy and coach have their hands placed strategically when the number is stated. 

10:03 Coach asks what number Jimmy can survive on if he guaranteed him a certain amount of money. Jimmy responds with what I assume is ""a hundred""

10:30 Coach for some reason offers Jimmy 30% equity in all future business ventures because he is delusional and probably on drugs.

Does Coach cap all of his businesses at an imaginary number in his head? If he really wanted his business to grow how could he give a bank teller 30% stake in all of his fake businesses? When his massage clients, SORRY, silent investors find this out why would they bother investing? 

Why doesn't Jimmy, a supposed business genius, not see the stupidity in such a proposal and school Coach on this? 

11:50 Coach tells Jimmy he made a promise to himself to go all in and fall back on a regular line of work if it doesn't work out. By regular work he means tuggin'

13:00 coach tells Jimmy he will only pay him salary for one year if he decides to join. He takes a 5 second pause after this and tells Jimmy that after that it will only be ""pure equity""

Jimmy repeats that term and looks off into the distance as if it is a good idea (it is a terrible idea).

13:22 Coach tells Jimmy in the next year he wants to open the following:

1) a tattoo parlour 2) sushi restaurant 3) coffee shop

Jimmy makes a sour face and looks impressed. 

Jimmy tells Coach he doesn't mind stepping away from the corporate lifestyle he never lived and will need to wait until his ""fat bonuses"" hit his account.

If Jimmy were a big shot in the corporate world, he’d have to return that “fat bonus” if he left the firm within a certain period after receiving it.


All in all, I can conclude this is essential TPG viewing. Jimmy had many chances within this episode to show he was truly business savvy but he just sits there making weird faces.

Just preparing for my trip to Portugal in a few weeks. Visiting Porto, Lisbon and Madeira. 

Just wondering about mornings/breakfast time.. I’ve heard that Portugal isn’t as big on breakfast food like in Canada (which is totally fine), I’m mostly just wondering if there are any actual cafes or restaurants open in the morning that early? (Whether they serve breakfast food or not) I’m fine with pastries and coffee or even sandwiches. Literally anything.

I have also heard that Portugal eats very late for dinner (again, compared to Canada), if we plan on eating earlier do you think we still need to make reservations? (As most people will likely be eating much later). Or if we do eat later, does EVERYWHERE require reservations? 


Thanks in advance 😊

TLDR: 
#1- basically just wondering if there is cafes where I can get anything to eat in the morning.

Lunch was a two egg omelette with a slice of American cheese and that held me until 7pm! My wife got pizza for my kids for dinner, so I had a very small, slender slice (my first complex carbs in a week) with a few bites of spinach salad and then instant indigestion. 

The tiny pizza slice killed me! I’ve had horrible reflux and indigestion for the past few hours now - so interesting learning how to eat again. 

I’ve been eating really clean aside from the pizza tonight and drinking plenty of water - just wasn’t expecting the extreme lack of interest in food to come so quickly - nor the realization that my diet may be completely changing. Certainly for the better - it’s just wild. 🤪

[The Chase Park Plaza: Lost Tables](http://www.losttables.com/chase/chase.htm)

The Chase, a connected complex of hotel and apartment suites, began construction at Chase Park, St. Louis in 1921. 

Under the direction of attorney Chase Ulman, the hotel was finished in just 9 months, with it’s public opening in September 1922.

The nine-story hotel contained 500 guest rooms, and multiple dining areas, including the Palm Room, which appears very similar to Maribel’s Marigold Room.

Located directly behind the ground floor main lounge, the Palm Room featured a dace floor, with nightly dancing to a featured orchestra. 

The Palm Room had an inauspicious start, in 1922, during the second New Year’s Eve under prohibition. 

Cards placed on each table earnestly requested patrons not to violate the law, though by this time many had learned how to smuggle concealed flasks into public places. 

The Lost Tables article also gives this uproarious account of the 1922 New Year’s Eve party:

“The party attracted Gus O. Nations, St. Louis’ chief Prohibition enforcer. After midnight, Nations and five assisting officers strolled brashly into the Palm Room, checking for drinks and glancing beneath tables. A woman screamed, claiming an officer mistook her gown for a tablecloth. Her offended escort slugged the agent and outraged patrons threw plates and silverware at the officers, who retreated with revolvers drawn.”

In 1927, the Westborough Country Club, which had recently become wildly successful after going semi-public, contracted with Hotel Chase to use their Palm Room as a complimentary winter venue for for it’s entertainers.",14,1743904453.0,Lackadaisy,6,1.0,False

So, I had this idea for my personal music project site, `ninetofivenoise.com`. I wanted to add a whole loop for users: learn, get inspired, create, share, and vote. Over the last 3 days, fueled by coffee and a *lot* of back-and-forth with Gemini, I managed to actually build and deploy it!

**The New Workflow/Features:**

The goal was to let people:

1. Check out the new **""How To Make Music""** section for tips.
2. Use the **AI Lyric Generator** I integrated (it talks to Ollama in the background) to brainstorm ideas.
3. Go off and actually **create their track** (using whatever tools they like).
4. Come back and **upload their finished song** directly to the site.
5. Have the **community vote** on the tracks.

**The ""Exploit"" (feat. Gemini):**

Getting this entire feature set conceived, coded, and *especially* deployed onto my Ubuntu/Nginx/Gunicorn/Flask server in roughly 72 hours felt like a major achievement. I definitely couldn't have done the deployment and debugging part nearly as fast without Gemini acting as my coding buddy/navigator. We tackled everything from basic Git commands I'd forgotten, through weird Linux permission errors, all the way to deciphering cryptic Python errors (like a `ModuleNotFoundError` causing a chain reaction `BuildError` – Gemini helped connect those dots way faster than I would have alone).

**Check It Out & Roast Us!**

I'd love for you guys to take a look at [`ninetofivenoise.com`](http://ninetofivenoise.com) and tell me what you think!

* Any feedback on the new features?
* Tips for improving the site or the workflow?
* **Roast away!** Seriously, what did I likely mess up? How fragile is this setup probably? And definitely roast my reliance on AI – where do you think Gemini might have steered me wrong or encouraged a shortcut that will bite me later?

1jsjcpj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jsjcpj,"Weather watch - Sunday, April 6"," Good morning, everyone.  Thought I would get some data and tap out a quick update while having a cup of Komeda coffee.  Found out - to my surprise - that today is actually pretty active.  Thanks to our drinking buddies at Weathernews for the maps. 

  Most of the action is in the Kanto area, with other parts of the country being largely quiet.  
 
  Let’s start with the sakura situation.  The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in many parts of the coast from northern Kanto on down to Kyushu.  Blossoms have started to fall in southern Kyushu, a period known as the 桜吹雪 (sakura fubuki), where the falling petals resemble snow.  Man, I’ve been in Japan 35 years and just learned this today.  
  Sakura will begin blooming in northern parts of the country from this coming week.  

  Rain is also in the forecast for much of the Mideast of the country today.  After overnight rain in Kansai, the low pressure trough generating the rain is moving eastward, currently soaking Shizuoka and Aichi.  Kanto residents should start to see some precipitation from around noon today.  

  “But, hey!  The rain is good for my allergies!”, some folks will say.   Yeah, about that.  Much of Kanto will see heavier than normal pollen activity today, with the heaviest concentrations in Ibaraki, Tochigi and northern Saitama prefectures.  So, take your Claratin before you go check out the sakura if you live in that area.  

  Finally - and perhaps most shocking - we have apparently entered the ゲリラ雷雨 (Gerira Raiu, or Pop-up Thunderstorm) season way, way early.  I started noticing them about 12 years ago, and these things usually don’t become a fixture of the Japan weather landscape until June or so, but they seem to be making an early entry this year.  We had our first round of pop-ups last Friday, and, today, we have a heightened risk of them in Nagano and eastern Chiba today. 

  That’s it.  I got to get back to my coffee before it gets cold.  Have a great day, everyone!",11,1743904311.0,japanweather,0,1.0,False

I’ve received about five messages in 36 hours, none of those including what he’s doing, who he’s visiting, how the trip is going. Just an arrived at hotel, going to bed, that kind of thing. He planned very little in advance other than attending an event on the last day. He is very familiar with the city, this is not an exploration type trip. 

For context, we have been together over four years, friends for longer, we live together, I manage the vast majority of our lives including finances (including budgeting and saving his money for his trip for him). This has created accumulating resentment for me and our relationship is rocky lately. We are both autistic and have struggled with mental health. I manage anxiety extremely well these days and often all I need in terms of help/support from my partner is information, especially as plans develop and/or change. We stay in touch even during work hours - a little vent here, a funny customer there, we spotted a dog. 

I don’t expect constant updates. I don’t even expect frequent updates. He’s on a trip with a friend, I get it, I assume he’s busy. When he messaged going to bed after a day of next to no contact, I was hurt but understood, and did not make a fuss as I don’t want to hinder his ability to enjoy the trip. Knowing this man and his morning routines, I assumed he would check on me and give me a quick update during his morning chain smoking and coffee, but no.

As I said, I’m on the spectrum and sometimes don’t realize my expectations are unrealistic. My expectations derive more from how I’d act in the situation, and in this case, I would miss him terribly and want to maintain connection and include him in my world by sharing a few photos or a quick call to hear his voice. I am trying to not let my brain convince me that he feels/wants the opposite of those things. Or is this a great example of how little he considers me, how little he actually misses me, how little he wants to share small joys and involve me in his life?

Jayden Perez squinted at Tanner's text through the darkness of his virtual reality cubicle.

""Meet you in five,"" he texted back,.

Tanner. He drives a 2035 Electric Lexus but comes to work everyday looking like he rolled out of bed in his teenage brother's old clothes. He's also been a rock of support.

Jayden stretched his arms upward to greet the welcoming morning sun. The wooden plank that passed for a bench sat under a small stand of trees just outside the building that housed Jayden's dream job. Six months of pure, unadulterated artistic joy, the kind of work he'd dreamed about since high school. Today, however, would be Jayden's last day at his dream job-he just didn't know it.

""What's up,"" he asked Tanner, who sat nursing the last of his stale coffee.

""Damn, what isn't up?  Amboy just slammed me with three extra clients. Three! And they're all wanna be jarheads.""

""Sorry, dude. Military's gotta train them somehow. Virtual reality's the closest to war they're gonna get without putting their butts in the way of bullets.""

""I know, I know. Must be me, then. Jarheads just remind me of my older brother. Captain, and he thinks he's God's right hand man. Hey, are you and Kayla coming to the gig tonight?""

""Wish we could, brother, but I'm pulling the night shift.""

""Who's the client?""

""That's the weird thing. The schedule doesn't say.""

""Oh, damn.""

""What?""

""When the schedule leaves out the name, it's for reasons of confidentiality. Not sure what kind of client you'll have, but they leave it blank to keep that info private.""

""Why was I chosen? I mean, I'm cool with the over time, although Kayla won't be too happy. But why me?""

""Why NOT you?""

""I'm not ready.""

""How do you know? You don't even know what the assignment is.""

""I'm a newbie here. Lots of people have been here for years. Like you. It should've been you.""

""C'mon JP, man. Your work is solid. Take it as a compliment.""

""Man, I'm an artist. A VR artist, right? If this assignment requires anything outside that skill set, I'm screwed.""

""Look, we're not onstage til ten. Text if you need a sounding board to tell you you're on the right path.""

""Thanks, man.""

""Or to tell you you're f-in' crazy.""

""See?""

""Kidding, kidding! Chill! You got this, JP.""

Jayden's phone beeped.

""Amboy wants me in his office. Wish me luck.""

""Okay, but really, I'm not sure why I should. You'll be coming out a lot richer next paycheck than me.""

Jayden rode the elevator to the top floor of VR Magic, then stood hesitantly outside of Amboy's open door. What to call him? He and Tanner refer to him as ""Amboy"";  he's only a second older than them, so ""mister"" just feels odd. But he's the Director of Digital Creations, so they're not exactly on a first-name basis either.

""JP! Come on in!""

Jayden entered the sunny office and sat in a plush chair opposite Amboy. Five vintage electric guitars hung on the wall behind Amboy's desk.

""Tanner says I can come onstage tonight and jam with the band. Cool, huh? Not sure which guitar to bring. My 2010 Gibson or the'64 Strat?""

""Heh, great."" Jayden licked his lips.

""Okay, lemme fill you on tonight's assignment. We gave you this case because of your psychology background.""

""Uh, I should really tell you that I actually double-majored. I spent a lot more time on my art and AI studies. I don't think I'm quite...""

""Gaylen told me how modest you are, but I didn't believe him until now. Don't worry, we didn't get this wrong. You're definitely the right person for this case.""

Amboy slid a file across the desk to Jayden.

""Ever heard of Dr. Remutha? Sari Remutha.""

""Oh, yeah, her name rings a bell. My girlfriend watches her channel every so often.""

""Dr. Remutha has 250 million YouTube subscribers. She's a psychologist. Specializes in trauma therapy. She's got a five year waiting list. Seems like everyone wants to be her patient.""

""Yeah, that's what Kayla told me. She actually does her sessions right there, on camera.""

""Right. And it's brilliant, isn't it? Because no one's cured in just one session, right? So it's like a serial story-you watch as the patient goes through therapy, week after week, month after month. Like a story with chapters.""

Or a soap opera, Jayden thought.

""So Dr, Remutha contacted us. She needs our help. One of her clients, an older woman, has a blocked memory. She wants to use VR to help re-create what might be the event that caused the trauma. To help the woman remember the event. Your job is to use all of your powers to create that world, the one she inhabited over sixty years ago, to help jog her memory. You'll have every research tool at your disposal. So don't worry, we got you on this.""

Jayden's muscles felt reduced to paper mache. Amboy saw him slump in his seat.

""Yeah, right? That was my feeling, too.  This is a social media first, isn't it? I mean,  there are more psychs out there than there are stray dogs in the streets, but she's the only one who's posting what a session actually looks like. Talk about massive online engagement!""

Jayden's eyes had rested on the file, but they now held Amboy in a steady gaze.

""Is this actually legal? I-I'm sorry to ask, but isn't that something that needs to take place in a private session?""

Amboy flushed.

""W-Well....uh....sure, of course! Conventionally speaking, yeah, sessions are private. But it's legal, because the clients sign a waiver to allow their sessions to be recorded. So it's not like anyone's being fooled....""

""No, Mr....Amboy...it's not just confidentiality. That's part of it, sure. But the memories and feelings that crop up during therapy. None of it's planned. Patients could freak out, have panic attacks, if bad memories come flooding back. If the memories are extreme, they might even go into shock. This would all happen while the camera is rolling. It just seems.....risky.""

""Look, this is all above board. We've already cleared it with our legal team. That's all you really need to give a crap about, at this point,""

""Mr. Amboy, I-I'm just not sure about this. I mean, I'm certainly no psychologist....""

""And if you don't take this assignment, you also might not be an AI artist.""

""Whuh-what? What?""

""That's right, JP. That promotion you keep banging on about to Scharf....""

""He told you? I asked him...""

""There are no secrets here, JP. If you want that promotion, it's not a ""gimme."" You need to earn it. And quite frankly, if you want to remain an AI artist with VR Magic, you also need to prove you're a team player.""

Jayden's arms flopped helplessly at his sides.

""Whuh......What happens if this woman can't take the memories? What protections will be on hand if she ends up being so overwhelmed she can't take it? Y-You know we can't totally control AI....we....we can't totally control what that world will actually be. What if....""

""What if....what if....what's the deal, JP? C'mon, damn it....""

""No....what if AI adds something that I forget to include-or keep out? I want to recreate the world she'd remember. I don't actually want her to relive the traumatic event... not again.....what if AI displays it, no matter how hard I try to keep it out....""

""What the hell? She HAS to see and hear it again! She has to! How else is her memory going to be jarred? I mean, doesn't she?""

Jayden looked at the floor. Laughter rang out down the hall.

""I'm going to leave this office to get coffee. If I come back and you and this file are gone, I'll know you're the team player we need at VR Magic.""

Jayden watched Amboy round the corner of the hallway. School loans were due. So were the bills. He grabbed the file and walked it back to the darkness of his cubicle.",1,1743903562.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I summarized some of the tricks I used during interviews and applied them consistently in the end. One of my recruiters even said that my performance and communication style impressed him, which proved that these methods were super useful. Here are my tricks that helped me improve my prep quality:

**Start with small talk**: It helps me relax and get into the right mindset and it leaves HR with a friendly impression. I usually start by asking where they are and how the weather is, and what I’ve been up to recently.

**Use the Q&A session to sell myself again**: I usually say something like: ""I know this is a very competitive position. I’d love to know what qualities you value most in a candidate."" Based on the HR’s answer, I will summarize and highlight my strengths again to reinforce my impression. I also proactively ask about the next steps to express my strong interest in the role.

**Research HR in advance**: Before interviews, I usually search for the HR’s profile on LinkedIn to prepare targeted questions for the Q&A session and show my interest. If I notice they’ve been with the company for a long time, I’ll casually mention it: ""I noticed you’ve been with the company for quite a while, which shows great commitment. Could you share what you like most about working here?""

**Make your experience audience-friendly**: Most HR don't have tech background, so it’s important to explain my work in a way they can understand. I generally write out my example and let ChatGPT rephrase it to be friendly for non-technical audiences.

**Connect with alumni from the company as soon as you get the interview**: This is the most efficient way to quickly learn about the company. When connecting with alumni, don’t immediately jump into asking for a coffee chat, ask them about the interview process and what they like most about working at the company.

**Show your understanding of the company during the interview**:Let the HR or hiring manager know that you’ve done your homework for this interview. Prepare an example in advance that strongly connects the company’s culture, outlook, or business with your personality or experience.

**Prepare a work sample related to the company**: It’s a good chance to showcase your execution skills and capabilities. Make the HR or hiring manager feel valued and respected.

**Maximize free resources**: Generate answers tailored to my resumes, questions, and specific roles: ChatGPT; Question prediction based on job roles and real question banks: AMA Interview; Practice for coding interviews and system design: Educative; Data techniques, the latest reports, and supplemental learning: DataCamp",3,1743903095.0,jobsearchhacks,0,1.0,False

No Steps. No Sponsor. Just Survival.

I should be dead.
Statistically speaking — with what I went through, with what I put in my body — I should be another name carved into stone or floating in a back-page obituary.

But I’m not.

I lived through the chaos of the early 2000s touring scene. Not the TikTok-glossy, cleaned-up version — I mean the wild, dirty, unforgiving circuit. The kind where heroin, pills, alcohol, and everything in between were easier to find than food. Where overdoses weren’t “if,” they were “when.” And where being a stage tech meant you were holding up the show while your own soul was barely standing.

I didn’t get clean in rehab.
I didn’t sit in meetings holding a cup of shitty coffee reciting mantras.
No 12 steps. No higher power speeches. No clapping circles.

I got clean because I was done dying.

I had a small circle of people who gave a damn.
That’s it. No counselor. No sponsor. Just a few good ones who didn’t give up on me when I couldn’t even look in a mirror.
I clawed out. Bit by bit. Withdrawals, silence, rage, guilt, all of it.

And then I walked away from heroin. From pills. From everything.
That was 8 years ago.
Two years ago, I did it again — this time with alcohol.
Same method. No program. Just grit and the knowledge that I wasn’t going back.

I’m not writing this to flex.
I’m writing this because I know someone out there feels like they’ve hit that wall — and they’re not “doing it right” because they didn’t follow the system.

Let me be clear: You don’t have to follow the system. You just have to survive.

Your path won’t look like mine.
It might include meetings. It might not.
But if you’re still breathing — if you’re reading this — then you’ve got a shot.
And I promise you: the moment that beast loses its grip, you’re going to feel like someone turned the lights back on inside your chest.

I came out the other side. I’m still healing. Still fighting. But I’m building something beautiful now — not just with my hands, but with my story. And if you’re in the dark, just know there’s someone out here who made it out without a map.

No steps.
No sponsor.
Just survival.

1jsiz2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/dialysis/comments/1jsiz2h/finally_seeing_the_light/,Finally Seeing the Light,"I (F31) have been home for a few days after an open bilateral nephrectomy. My kidneys were massive, and I keep looking back at the picture I have of them. It could be the pain meds I'm still on, (or maybe the steroid because my blood pressure was so low I had to stay a short while in the ICU, and I will be on steroids until August when I can see an endocrinologist) but honestly I haven't felt this good in a long time. Yeah, I slipped butt-first down the stairs this morning, and my abdominal incision hurts like hellfire if I'm late with the meds, but mentally I feel grand.

I don't have a lot of my GI tract left, so I don't really absorb fluids the way most people do. I can so far drink 2L without seeing any signs of swelling in my feet. What swelling I have seen was mild at best and went away by the next morning/night.

Before, a 2-hour treatment of just cleaning, no fluid pulling, left me with an all-day migraine that was only fixed if I washed down a couple Tylenol and three tabs of sodium bicarbonate with a cup of coffee. No idea why that worked, but it was the only thing that did it. Now, though, I can have a 3.5 hour treatment where they remove 700mL to 1L at least and I'll feel fine. My blood pressure is lower than before the nephrectomy, and while it makes me feel lightheaded if I stand up too fast, I'll take it over the rushing in my ears and black spots in my vision when it got too high.

The best part? I can eat again! My kidneys were so large due to PKD that I couldn't hold down food nor most liquids for the first two weeks of March. I suspect it actually goes back further than that because I've been declining mentally and physically since at least last September, and it takes time for that kind of growth to happen. I've possibly been under/malnourished for months, and it just finally came to a head recently.

I was so terrified of the surgery and what life would be like afterward, but honestly it's been wonderful. The pain was the worst I'd ever felt when I woke up from surgery, in all fairness. Definitely a 20/10 on the pain scale, not helped by the fact I chickened out of getting the epidural and I have that annoying redhead gene that messes with how I metabolize/gain resistance to sedatives and painkillers. So the fentanyl button did nothing, the dilaudid button was slightly better, and I think the buprenorphine patch just barely took the edge off by the time I was discharged.

But it isn't the *same* pain I've been dealing with for over a decade, and that's what I'm relieved about. I've done more at home in two days (light cooking and cleaning when I can get away with it. Rightfully so, my partner has to tell me to take a break and actually rest because I don't want to lay in bed all day) than I have in ages! Yes, I'm still recovering. Yes, I'm still in a lot of pain. Someone once told me that any procedure involving the kidneys is supposed to be the most painful to recover from. And I believe it. But the fact that I don't flinch when someone touches my flank or stomach? That it's soft to the touch? It's so *good*! I've also been more organized and consistent with my meds, when before I struggled to take them at all.

Like I said, I know it could just be all the drugs I'm on while recovering, but I really hope it isn't. I was so, so terrified before going into surgery, and the first two days afterward were excruciating. But even though I still need to take it slow, I'm not nearly as depressed and mentally/spiritually *heavy* as I was before. My case isn't the norm, for sure.

1jsiykk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1jsiykk/saily_esim_not_so_good_in_the_mtns/,Saily esim not so good in the mtns,"Got some good tips from this subreddit.   From our trip we learned some things:
1) Saily esim uses liberty network.  We had no coverage in the mountains around San Gerardo de Dora.  Even along Highway 34, the coverage was spotty.   For mountain coverage around San Gerardo, kolbi was recommended, but I did not feel like going into a store to set it up.   The Saily app did work well.   It probably is fine if you’re mostly staying in the north and northwest part of the country.
2) there is massive price diversity throughout the country, depending on the region. You can get very cheap meals in less touristic areas.   In the same store, a costa rican ice cream bar is 2 dollars but the haagen dazs is 6.   
3) in San Jose, I highly recommend Caféoteca in barrio Escalante. They use every brewing method (v60, chemex, aeropress etc) and are extremely precise in their brews, and feature coffees grown throughout the various regions of Costa Rica, so if you are looking for local specialty coffees as gifts, they have a huge selection, and much more interesting than what is at the gift shops at the airport. It also is  relaxing and modern space.  Also recommend Taj Mahal for excellent Indian cuisine. Because the traffic is so bad, I highly recommend looking at Uber eats for delivery, and the delivery charge was 500 colones
4) weather is unpredictable. We went at the end of March and had heavy rains almost every day, but these would usually stop within an hour.  
5) adobe car rental was fine.   Easy pick up and drop off. Probably not the cheapest option, but it seems like there are some shady outfits out there.

I ended having around a \~6 min conversation with her where I eventually gave her my number (and she seemed interested at the time). She never texted me, but she added me on Instagram ( I never said my last name, and I have a pretty generic first name, so I am not sure if she just looked in her suggested based on contacts or explicitly sought my insta out). I later messaged her on Instagram if she wanted to get together for a coffee sometime this week, she said she was busy. To be fair, it was midterm week, and the week before our school's Spring Break. After break, I spoke with her a few times, including like a 10 minute conversation. Last week I briefly approached her and spoke to her at the dining hall and she seemed to be peering over my shoulders waiting for her friends. Her friends eventually came, so I was going to leave, and I said are you available this week. She said she would check her calendar. I then said, well you have my number right, so just let me know. This was Monday and she has not texted me yet. I have seen her around the dining hall, and some part of me feels like she might be trying to avoid me (but I do tend to overthink a lot). I want to approach her and talk to her some more, but I do not know if her not texting back means a no.

I stood in my garage today for three hours working on my business (there is an AC unit  there so maybe 75 degrees max), and even with breaks I felt a sudden need to BM, made it to the bathroom started to feel like the blood was draining from my upper abdomen - kind of a shocked dizzy feeling spreading through my torso. I had to lay down for a few minutes for the feeling to subside. Even standing for short periods makes me feel somewhat dizzy and queasy.

1jsitpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProjectSekai/comments/1jsitpw/a_pjsk_experiment_use_your_10_pull_tickets_one_at/,A PJSK Experiment: Use your 10 pull tickets one at a time OR save your tickets until the end and mass pull - Which is better?,"Hello everyone. This week I was bored and conducted an experiment.

Now, statistically, we ALL know the game rates, and theoretically all the rates should equate the same amount whether it's singles or 10 pulls, etc, etc. But I was bored. And I have 2 accounts so I thought, why not bring this to the test?

Hypothesis: Despite the current odds/rates being even for 4 stars, I predict the mass-pull/saving tickets will yield in more 4 star characters

The experiment:

**ACCOUNT A - USING TICKETS RIGHT AWAY**

Day 1 - No 4 stars

Day 2 - No 4 stars

Day 3 - 1 4 star (Delicious Pancakes for Everyone! - VBS Kaito)

Day 4 - 1 4 star (A Moment's Rest - Mizuki Akiyama)

Day 5 - No 4 stars

Day 6 - No 4 stars

Day 7 \[last day/today\] - **3 FREAKING 4 STARS** (\[A New Member Arrives - MMJ Megurine Luka\], \[Donuts and Memories - Haruka Kiritani\], \[How I Really Feel - Mafuyu Asahina\])

**Thoughts on Part A** \- Bruh. I wish this was my main. I want that mafuyu so badly BRUHHH. Other than that, the luck was average until today. LIKE HELLO?? 3 FOUR STARS IN ONE 10 PULL???? Tbh at this point, I felt beat. However could my main stack up against this?? On top of that, this account pulled a 4star Dog Honami by accident with 3 single pulls \[I have this account at first bc I wanted to stop my gacha addiction, then I rolled on sanrio and got a bunch of 4 stars, now I'm saving it for a friend as a gift\]

ANYWAY! Without further a-do! (Feel free to predict what I'll get lol)

**ACCOUNT B - SAVING UP ALL TICKETS AND SPENDING THEM**

Roll 1 - 1 4 star (Heated Argument - VBS Kagamine Rin)

Roll 2 - 1 4 star (Outfits Assembler! - Akito Shinonome)

Roll 3 - No four stars

Roll 4 - 1 4 star (Talking Coffee Time - VBS MEIKO \[Dupe unfortunately\])

Roll 5 - No four stars

Roll 6 - No four stars

Roll 7 - 2 four stars \[(Yokohama? I Predict Good Food! - MMJ Hatsune Miku), (Outstretched Hand - Ena Shinonome)\]

**Thoughts on Part B** \- Since I rolled on this account second, at roll 6, I was mourning LMAO I was thinking about how I should've spent my tickets everyday. My second thought after pulling two 4 stars was ""TF?? I GOT AN EVEN AMOUNT?"" My second thought was - ""The VS love me on every account"" The last of my brain cells were spent mourning the masked mafuyu card not being on my main, and mourning the shinonome siblings stuck on my main. Also that Haruka card is really cute

**EXPERIMENT CONCLUSION:**

As much as we try to be superstitious to achieve more luck or 'become blessed by the gacha gods', there is no difference between saving your 10 rolls or not. Surprisingly, the amount of 4 stars was even across both accounts, causing us to reject our original hypothesis at its current state. It was real close at the end though. Main conclusion? Luck is Luck. It's random, no science behind it (other than the statistical percentages of course).

However!! It is important to note - The probability of pulling 3 four stars in one 10 pull is VERY rare. Keeping this in mind, I would hypothesize if this experiment were to repeat, the savings side would yield a greater amount of 4 stars. But all this is just a theory. A GAME THEORY.

lol.

Now, to write my actual lab report instead of this experimental run....congrats if you read this far! It's your turn! Would love to hear how your free pulls went or if you did something similar!!",4,1743902531.0,ProjectSekai,10,0.84,False
1jsitiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jsitiy/my_best_friends_boyfriend_is_jealous_of_our/,My best friend’s boyfriend is jealous of our friendship,"I’m a 20 year old college student and my best friend has been dating this guy (we’ll call him Adam) for the past two years. She has been my best friend this entire year and we have gotten super close and her boyfriend lives across the street from me in our college town. She always stays the night at his place and I don’t have my car here so every morning she picks me up since I am right across the street and we get coffee and then go back to her place and hangout / go to the gym. We basically spend a lot of time together. When I first met her boyfriend he was nice and we are all friends (i am the only single girl in my friend group and all my best friends are dating guys in the same frat). Recently he has been kind of a jerk I have noticed. Ex: Anytime she is happy about something or gets an award for school he doesn’t seem very supportive and he seems to diminish her light if that makes sense. He is often in a bad mood and gets jealous very easily. He got mad when she went out with me alone when he was out of town and he wouldn’t say why but I think it’s because I am single and he gets insecure since she is super attractive. She would never cheat on him tho. She is an amazing girlfriend to him. Also, she pays for a lot of stuff for him even tho his parents are rich and give him money all the time. He has a job but chooses to work like once a month meanwhile she works 4 days a week 9-5. Her parents also don’t give her money like his do. On spring break, I had a guy over who was younger than us but me being single it wasn’t anything serious and our group consisted of my best friend, her boyfriend, and our other two friends that are dating. When i say he was so mean to the guy i had over and kept acting like a dick i was so annoyed. The guy was kinda being annoying but he was a little younger than us so it made me upset seeing him be so mean. And then he called my best friend upstairs and was annoyed saying he wanted the guy i had over to leave and that he was gonna kick him out. I was really upset because i’m over here 5th wheeling and this is the one time i bring a random guy around and he was so rude about it. the next day, EVERYONE apologized EXCEPT for him. That made me really upset because it just made me think he doesn’t care that he was so rude and it was so disrespectful to me. another example, last night we all went out for the boys frat parents weekend and he was in a bad mood from the minute i got there. he then left with his dad to go to another bar and kept telling my best friend he didn’t feel good. we ended up meeting him at the other bar and he was being rude to my best friend and ignoring us both. I am currently talking to a guy in his frat that he is friends with and i was really excited because he said he was going to meet us there. Then my best friends boyfriend ordered an uber and said we were leaving and I was so annoyed because I was looking forward to seeing the guy i’m talking to (we just started texting this week so i haven’t seen him in person yet and i was excited but of course Adam ruined it.) I just got in the uber with Adam and my best friend because i live right across the street from him and it was just easier. The next morning, my best friend picked me up and told me he was upset because of me. She kept saying she doesn’t get it and she’s annoyed that he acts like that but i think it’s ridiculous that he is so jealous of our friendship. She told me he always says he likes me and he has no problem with me it’s just that “i’m always around” and “there’s a time and place for me to be there.” IM SORRY WHAT? this is my BEST FRIEND and there’s all of a sudden a “time and place” for when i can see her? wtf is this. i am so annoyed and feel awkward hanging out with our group when he’s there now. I’ve talked to the other girls in our group about this and they all think he has a jealousy problem and is controlling but they also won’t say anything about it because their boyfriends are all best friends with this guy. it is so frustrating and makes me upset because I can’t even go out with my friends anymore without feeling like he’s going to be in a bad mood because of my presence. He tells my best friend i “take away all the attention from him” yet whenever my best friend tries to sit with him at the bar he’s just talking to his friends and is dismissive of her. idk guys what do you think i should do i feel like im going insane. And i am very socially aware of things and I know for a fact i am not annoying. I am the furthest thing from annoying just to be clear so I know it isn’t that . ",1,1743902513.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1jsiqcq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jsiqcq,[A3][Recruiting][GMT/EST][Variety][Relaxed/Casual] 222nd Arma Battalion | Bad Company,"**About Bad Company**

Our unit is a fictional Company within the US Army with a captivating story set in an imaginary world where miscreants find themselves in a unique penal unit instead of being discharged.

**Our Operations:**

At Bad Company, we believe in the thrill of infantry-based combat. While we occasionally engage in combined arms operations, the mission maker and the current scenario dictate our approach. Expect an exciting mix of ground combat with support from pilots and vehicle crews whenever possible.

Bad Company's current storyline takes our players to delve into the annals of history, taking on the personas of different generations of Bad Company, participating in significant wars in which the US Army was involved. After that, our adventures will breach the boundaries of reality as we explore alternate universes like Halo, Fallout, 40k, and more.

When we play, fun is our primary focus. We're not your traditional milsim, but some members enjoy adding roleplay elements to their characters for an immersive experience.

**Operation Times:**

Saturday - 20:30 UTC+1 / 14:30 EST (Campaign/Story-based ops)

**Roles:**

In-game roles are not restricted by training, but we do ask that you possess sufficient knowledge in your chosen position. Training can easily be provided if needed. Our Squad leaders may occasionally ask you to take on a certain role to enhance team effectiveness.

**Mods:**

Our mod packs are thoughtfully curated and tailored to each new campaign while avoiding drastic changes. We try our best not to utilize Community-DLCs unless needed, ensuring accessibility for all members. With that in mind, most of our packs include:

* ace
* CUP
* RHS
* S & S
* Improved Melee System
* Project Injury Reaction
* KAT Medical
* ACRE2
* Currently Operation Trebuchet

**Attendance:**

Flexibility is the name of the game at Bad Company. We understand that life can be hectic, so we only request members to participate in at least one mission every three weeks. Should you require a break, post a Leave of Absence (LOA) without the need for review or approval.

Hey,Tamil CF guy here let me tell about me.
I'm 25 years young who was just rebellious to prove my cf decision(having child is a personal choice so I fought with them to respect my personal choice also by sharing the reasons why I took cf decision)to my parents and got their approval. An avid trekker, backpacking to everest in July, CA by education but into business for satisfaction. An adventure junkie sometimes I find skydiving soothed me than anything else. Based in salem and hosur(so Bangalore works out too) Learning paragliding for past 2 months. Apart from travel I love baking and cooking (except dishwashing part),I play PC games a lot. (Apex legends>valorant)
Friends say my pizza is way more better than domino's. Decathlon is the place where I love to go when I feel tired or drained. Love working out and hitting the gym. I'm a guy who believes in God but not in rituals. My religion is love and compassion(born as hindu) and ethics. Financially I'm well stable and sufficient enough to support my travel goals and a comfortable lifestyle and have no debts. Things that I wish that you should know is I travel for atleast 150 days in a year. I love writing poetry for my partner.(have a collection of 100 already). I live alone and not staying with my parents and this is gonna continue in future too.(because of my ventures otherwise they're sweet people)
I chose CF lifestyle because of health risks of my partner, my purpose of life and travel goals.(I'm more of purpose driven guy than a goal chaser)
Some points that may make my post interesting are 
1) I follow strict skin care routine
2)solo travelled and hiked all the major peaks of western ghats. Completed Hampta pass and lakes of kashmir trek too.
3) I have never drank alcohol or had a cigarette 
4) Planning for an all India food trip next year in 7 stages.
5) I'm planning and aiming for a wingsuit license in future.
6) Diesel head and love road trips a lot next to adventure activities. 
7) Books and newspapers are necessity for me.
8) Good food and coffee makes me happy.
9) All things that I love starts with letter S like sun(I love sunrise and sunset so i always try to not miss them),snow,skydiving,sky,stars,space,sea, even name of people I love and value starts with s.(so if your name starts with S you'll be new to this silly list but you'll be at the top of the list)

Some philosophy that I follow:

1) We all are just actors on the stage called earth directed by god, we don't know we wud go to hell or heaven after death So let us live our own fairytale on this heaven without any regrets.

2)Intentions over the actions(good action with bad intentions is worse than bad action with good intent)

3)cute gifts, appreciations,touch and healthy adjustments brings happiness every now and then which makes a relationship wholesome.

If you love travel and snow then you'll find my post interesting, believe me I will be more interesting in person as have lots of stories and surprises to share.

Last but not the least I have decided to be a childfree person throughout my life and there is no going back and I'm serious in my life choices. I'm looking for a CF partner who is firm in her decision.


Preferences ::
Age - 21-27

Location - India(If you're Tamil,Then I think my Tamil poetry needs no translation)

CF choice - no fence sitters


 The person should love to travel and emotionally available. For me trust and loyalty is the core basement of the relationship(I hate lying to loved ones even if it is very little one). Social drinking and smoking is ok(I'm ok with my sodas at the parties). The person should be into self care both mentally and physically.(I'm 5'6 and quite athletic build body type, I never miss my workouts) Also expect the person to believe selflove and mental health is important too.I expect my partner to respect my choices (my family is a vegetarian  but they respect my meat eating choices).I'm ok with long distance relationship and as of now I can't relocate because of my business nature I don't have flexibility to shift permanently as of now. I travel for 20 - 25 days continuously and concentrate on business for a month after it so consider whether my travelling style will suit you(can be changed for your convenience too)If you have any more questions I wud try to answer in dms(I'm sort of ambivert and love my privacy so even I installed instagram only in November) if you're an adventure junkie, don't hold back just message me we can atleast discuss a trip.
Feel free to dm with your intro. Looking for the msg for the new beginning.",2,1743901810.0,ChildfreeIndia,1,0.75,False

Hey MaximizeMe fam! 🌟 Ever find yourself staring at your screen, feeling like your brain is on a coffee break without you? 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️ Yeah, we've all been there. I used to lose time wandering in the depths of endless tabs and blinking cursors until I stumbled upon a nifty little trick. Spoiler alert: it doesn't involve caffeine or time travel (though I wish it did).

**So what's the magic?** It's something I like to call the ""10-Second Reset."" 

Here’s how it goes down:

1. **Stop Whatever You're Doing**: *Nope, not kidding*. In the middle of an email? Mid-sentence in a report? Just *stop*.

2. **Close Your Eyes & Take a DEEP Breath**: Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds, hold for 2, and exhale through your mouth for 4. (I promise you this doesn’t just work in yoga.)

3. **Visualize the Task at Hand**: Picture yourself completing it with ease. Visual cues can be powerful; it's like giving your brain a sneak peek of success.

4. **Open Your Eyes & Focus**: Bam! I find my brain becomes *weirdly laser-focused* after this. You somehow re-enter the zone with clarity you didn't know you had.

Sounds almost too simple, right? 🤔 But trust me, the beauty lies in its simplicity. It’s like flipping a switch on your brain from “chaos” mode to “hero” mode. 

**Why it works (in my very unscientific opinion):** 

- **Interrupts Overthinking:** Ever get that endless loop where you’re thinking *about* thinking? Yeah, me too. This breaks the cycle.

- **Gives a Micro-Break:** It’s like a mini-vacation for your neurons. 🍹 Warm beach not included.

- **Triggers Focus:** You’re not just breathing; you’re tricking your brain into thinking, “Hey, maybe I should do something functional now.”

And let's be honest, who doesn’t have 10 seconds to spare? It's been saving me around 10 hours a week that I'd late confess were spent doing God knows what. 🕵️‍♂️

Would love to hear your thoughts or other tricks you've discovered. Maybe the secrets of the universe are already lurking in our heads, and we just need a 10-second pause to find them? 💭✨",1,1743901731.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I recently built an app called AI Snap&Sort, and I’d love to share it with you all.

♻️ What it does:

You just snap a photo of any waste item (like a coffee cup, packaging, food scraps, etc.), and the app instantly tells you whether it belongs in recycling, compost, or trash — powered by AI.

🔍 Why I made it:

I was constantly second-guessing which bin to use, and I figured others were too. Most people want to do the right thing, but sorting rules are confusing and vary by location. So I built this tool to make it easier — and even a little fun.

📱 Try it out:

The app is now live on the App Store, and I’d love for you to give it a try!

💬 I’m super open to feedback — good or bad — and happy to hear suggestions.

Thanks for checking it out! Let’s make recycling a bit smarter and simpler, one snap at a time. 🙌",1,1743901719.0,recycling,0,1.0,False

Kira looked over the crew list and cursed silently, then looked at Evelyn and Adam.

“Well, I warned you about her. I can only see her bringing them for three reasons. “

Adam was looking out of the window at the city below. “And those three things would be?”

“Robbing you, killing you, or starting a crime syndicate here. She isn’t softhearted, so it's not to rescue them.” She said as a matter of fact. Evelyn looked between them and sighed.

“Well, she is in for a surprise. It's not an outpost anymore, and we can't have her running around playing crime lord.” She said. Kira nodded as she looked at Adam.

“I understand if you don’t want to take any chances.” 

“wait? What? No. I’m not arresting her just for coming here. Besides, a gang like that would break out of the jail quicker than we put them inside.” He turned to look at her, and he realized she was not talking about arresting her. “Oh. Hell no. I want to know how safe it would be to talk to her. She wants a face-to-face.”

“Face-to-face? Where? Not alone. That would be insane.” Kira replied. “If you meet here, you do it on a Navy hangar. Just to make sure she understands the situation. I should join you as well, bring that werewolf and blue cat as well.” Kira replied, and Evelyn looked at her.

“What about me?”

“No, if she sees you and finds out you're pregnant with his kids, then she might go after you to get him. “

“You worried about her, aren’t you?” Adam said, and she nodded.

“Yes, when we got sent here, she saw it as being let off the leash, and her first idea was to become a pirate. I had to talk her out of it.”

“How? What made her change her mind?” Adam asked.

“A girl she knew, Lisa Chiba. I had to remind her that she would not approve. She is probably the only person she really cares about. She gave her a stuffed animal when she was having nightmares. She laughed it off back then; she was, after all, 16, but she still has the animal. She has always kept a close eye on her. I think she even killed a guy to protect her.  She hasn’t spoken to her, but she told me she had married a good man.” Kira said, and Adam smiled.

“Well, her husband is here, it's Doc. And she is on her way. We can use that. But I won't use the human hangar I’m pretty sure Roks wants to show off Hammer.” He looked at Evelyn. “And if it were in any other situation, then I would want you there, but.”

“I understand, don’t worry about it. If it is safe, then I can meet her. It's been a while, after all.”

The transporter docked at the Hammer one day later. Adam was wearing the latest of civilian body protection at the insistence of everybody. He felt a little silly, but at least he wasn’t inside a mech suit.

He was standing next to Kira and Roks; sig-san was somewhere nearby, and half the crew working was guard droids with mudskin suits ready to act.  The door opened, and Sarah came out, took one quick look around, and smirked.

“Not trusting me sis?” She looked at Kira, who didn’t move.

“Are you surprised? Give me a reason. We saw the crew list.” She replied and Sarah chuckled and sat down on the ramp.

“And you didn’t think that was strange? It was almost as if I wanted you to know who I was bringing with me and not hide them as some veterans looking for word or old nuns?”

Adam looked at her and then at Kira, it was something they hadn’t thought off. “she got a point.”

“Yeah, but she also, who we all have worked for, she would lose all credibility if she was caught in a lie. Besides, this might just be a ruse, look at her. She is doing everything to appear non-treating. Where is the rest of your crew?” Kira said and Adam looked back at Sarah.

“Your move.”

‘I told them to wait, Look, we might just be passing through. Okey, here goes. Do you have any affection for the Republic of Avalon? They are a nation in the colony of New Eire—about 37 light years from Earth. And do you have any extradition agreement with them?” she stood up as she spoke, and Adam started to laugh.

“No, we don’t. What did you guys do?”

“Never mind that. Do you exchange Earth credits to Galaxy credits? We can agree to a 1200 to 1 if you don’t ask questions.”

“That depends. How big of a mess did you leave?”

“A few dead goons and a dead mafia boss.  One of us is in cryo; he has been under cryogenic suspension for the entire trip. You have human doctors here, right?” She asked, and Adam nodded.

“Yeah, we can arrange that, but for my safety, I’ll put you on a farm while I check the claim. If it's true, I’ll give you 1000 to 1. Are you okay with that?”

“Sure, You can trust me. “ Sarah said with a smile, it looked genuine and Adam looked at Kira. 

""You know where, right? You take them there. A wing will escort you.”

‘Yeah, no problem.” Then she walked over to her sister, and they hugged, making their way inside. Sarah stopped and looked back at him.

“Look at you. You did become our king. I won that bet.” Then she winked and walked after her sister. Adam looked confused at her as the ship took off and was escorted to an isolated farm.

Roks had been watching silently the whole time, and when they had left, he looked down at Adam.

“well, we didn’t expect that. Now, you are a crime lord too.” Then chuckled as Sig-San suddenly was next to them.

“Interesting lady, can we hire her? They had a sniper trained at you the whole time and the mine door had opened. If they needed to escape, then she would have rolled back in with the closing ramp as the sniper shot and dropped mines to detonate as they took off. A nice plan, actually. They are professional.”

They looked at him and Adam sighed. “I need to make a call, you guys can drool over them later. Just be careful, they are killers.”

“And what do you think we are?” Roks said, and Adam smiled as he walked away; he knew they were better killers, but what the hell if he would inflate their egos.

  
Adam was alone as he made the secure call, and after an hour's wait, a man appeared on the screen, he wore a white navy officer uniform with admiral rank. He had a cup of coffee in his hand. “Evening son, How are things going? You impressed us here. I knew we could count on you.”

“Evening, Christofer. I'm glad you guys like the show. You were quite useful to me. How is everything? I guess you already have the latest on me?”

The man chuckled. “Yeah, but I'd rather hear it from you, as for here. Same old, same old. Well, the war is officially over, of course, there are the remnants to hunt down. The less you know about that, the better for you. We will keep you out of it. The Nalos have little interest in that sector, and the locals are well aware of them. As me? My kids are doing great. My wife’s happy, so I’m happy. And you?”

“Well, got married, and Evelyn is with twins. But you knew that, but here is one thing you don’t know. Their name is Chris and Wei.“ Adam smiled as the old man put down his cup and looked at him, surprised. 

“Chris? Wow... I mean, I’m honored.” He smiled genuinely. “The wife would love to hear that.”

“Yeah, Evelyn choose Wei. Anyway, I am calling about something. Sarah Nam showed up with this crew.” He sent the list. “I need ID confirmation of them and proof of their story. They claim they did a job in the Republic of Avalon, on a colony called New Eire. Said they killed a few Goons. Do you know anything?”

Christofer Blackthorne looked over the file, quickly cross-checked it, and nodded. “oh.. yeah, that’s who she joined up with. The crew is a group of vigilantes. Unlike you guys, they went for vengeance. The Republic of Avalon is merely a front for a cartel; even the colony is attempting to have them expelled. They apparently got away with 130 million credits, but they won't be able to return to Earth space, as those individuals are well-connected.”  He said as he looked over the files.

“Are they yours?” Adam asked bluntly.

“No, but we do use them at times through agents like Sarah.  This one wasn’t sanctioned, and they killed a few heads of the cartel. It's up to you what you want to do with them. “

“So you don’t mind me hiring them?” Adam asked, and the admiral laughed.

“Are you setting up a competition? Hmm, how should I take this?”

“Well, I learned from the best. Thank you for the intel, and if you want to retire, then I got some nice farmland set aside for you.” Adam said with a smile.

“Be careful with giving such tempting promises. If I tell the wife she will force me to retire today.”

“Maybe I should call up Margrethe then. Send her some pictures.” Adam grinned, and the admiral sighed.

“Please don’t. I have too much fun here, and I would not be able to keep my fingers from your playground. Oh...” he looked away from the screen for a second. “Sorry, but something is coming up. I’ll send you the files and say hi to Evelyn and the others.” Then he cut the feed. Adam looked at the screen for a minute, deep in thought. He distrusted and trusted that man with his life. There was a time when he wished he had adopted him and times when he wished he had never met the man. The file suddenly popped up, and he looked at it. He always keeps his promises, at least. He got up and left the room, calling up Evelyn to ask what was for dinner.",31,1743901701.0,HFY,11,0.98,False

I’ve been dealing with occasional fatigue and brain fog, and honestly, the only thing that’s ever really helped is caffeine. Lately though, I’ve been on Accutane, and I’ve noticed that I need a lot more coffee just to feel the same effects and get anything done.

Now that finals and midterms are coming up, I feel like I need an extra kick—something that actually works to boost mental focus and energy.

So I’m looking for recommendations: has anyone tried a nootropic that genuinely helped with focus and energy? Ideally something with a lot of positive reviews or personal success stories behind it. Bonus points if it plays well with Accutane (or at least doesn’t worsen the side effects).

Thanks in advance!
