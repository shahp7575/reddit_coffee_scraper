1ili1om,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/1ili1om/feeling_depressed_because_i_thought_i_was/,Feeling depressed because I thought i was improving.,"As a disclaimer I do not know exactly what is wrong with me.

I'm 42, f, normal height and weight, active. I didn't do anything to hurt myself. 

Really i would say it started in oct-nov ish, I would wake up and my right leg would feel weak until I walked for a few minutes then it would be fine. I didn't think too much about it. But 7wks ago I went for a 2hr drive and had lunch with my mom and sister and when I stood up from the table I felt like I was going to collapse. My leg just felt weak. On the ride home the pain started and I have had pain ever since.
I would get pins and needles from my calf to the bottom of my foot. Pain was in my calf and back of my thigh.
I would order my coffee and have to sit and wait for it because my leg hurt too much to stand still. 
I went to urgent care. The guy said it sounded like sciatica and gave me prednisone. Did nothing. Went to my gp and she said piriformis syndrome even though I had no imaging. My buttock had started to hurt as well so she thought piriformis. Told me to take motrin and drink water and I'd be good. No. Luckily I had a friend giving me gabapentin and I felt normal but after a few hours the numbness and pain would come back. 

I still work 50-60hrs a week on my feet. I think it's wrong that I saw 2 drs and neither one would give me my own gabapentin. It's not like I was asking for anything else but I digress. It just makes me mad when people are in pain and aren't allowed anything. 

I sleep in a fetal position and when laying watching videos waiting to sleep if I would  stretch out and arch my back that was the only time I felt back pain and it would shoot down my leg. 

The last 2wks I had noticed improvements. I hardly ever get pins and needles anymore. I still have pain but it usually hits after I've been at work for 5 or 6 hours. I can get my coffee and stand and wait. I can stretch out and arch my back with hardly any pain. I told myself i was slowly improving...then yesterday happened. 

As soon as I woke up I felt off in my lower back. Right above my buttock to just below it and the side of my hip. I feel a strange sensation. Like a tightness? Yesterday I had one of my worst days of pain. It felt like the whole right side from just above my buttock, my whole buttock and just below it just hurt. When I was in bed for the first time I couldn't get comfortable. Usually I feel no pain laying down but last night was rough. And I scootched forward at one point pushing forward with my pelvis and pain shot through me so bad it took my breath away. And stretching was more painful than it's been. I'm not up and around yet so idk how I'll feel today but I'm pretty depressed because I thought i was improving and now i feel like I'm getting worse. It's depressing. Idek what is wrong to think of a timeline of when I should improve. I'm trying to accept this as my new normal. 

My next step will be to see a chiropractor or another dr who will do some type of imaging. I don't want to live in pain the rest of my life. I feel like an asshole because I know people have it worse. My sister being one. She is supposed to get surgery soon but it took her 20yrs of pain to be taken seriously. They finally said she has such degenerative disc disorder to the point that she has developed spinal stenosis and bone on bone arthritis in her spine. 20yrs. And I've dealt with it 7wks and I'm depressed. 

Sorry for the rant! I hope everyone here gets some relief! I'm gonna go work 10hrs today no matter how I feel because I have to live.

1ili19h,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ili19h/i_feel_wholly_unsupported_by_my_partner_of_two/,I feel wholly unsupported by my partner of two years,"I've been having a bit of a rough go of things this week, on Thursday evening I (26NB) rushed my cat (8M) to an emergency vet because be was acting like he was in pain and I noticed drops of bloody urine coming from his urethra. Turns out he had a large bladder stone stuck and needed what basically amounts to an emergency sex change operation (the silver lining is I get to make jokes about forcibly feminizing my cat lmao). I ended up staying up the whole night to get my cat to an emergency veterinary surgery that could perform that operation because they were a ways away (~1hr15min drive) and called my partner (28NB) who I don't live with to see if they could help given that I hadn't slept since the previous morning, but they were not in an awake enough/non tired state to help. I understood this and just had a few coffees/Coca-Cola's to stay awake, no harm no foul. My cat is still in the hospital recovering after some minor complications but the prognosis seems good I've just been running on fumes the past few days because of this.

I was originally planning on coming over to my partner's place today for a bit before going over to a friend's for DND but that got cancelled yesterday so plans were kinda up in the air. Previously he had brought up that my laundry being in with his was making it hard for him to put away his laundry and he wanted me to deal with it. I had originally planned to deal with it today, but had completely forgotten.

Today comes around and I'm achy and stressed out, not just about my cat but about stuff I need to get done that has been piling up throughout this, so I didn't actually want to come over. They asked about what plans for the day might be and I said as much, being apologetic but hoping they would understand given the circumstances (and given they go on about 'I want you to fill your cup first' all the time). At first they seemed understanding but then they brought up the laundry, which I get bringing up, but the thing is I had been there yesterday to stop by on the way back from visiting my cat in the hospital with my sister (22F) and I had forgotten about the laundry but they had not, it was apparently fresh on their mind but they didn't want to ""embarrass me in front of my sister"" which it wouldn't have been embarrassing?

But anyways I get kinda anxious and start spiraling because I know he wants me to just make plans to come over sooner rather than later to deal with the laundry but I don't really want to for the next few days because of the afformentioned stuff that's piled up a bit that I have to deal with (grad school homework, cleaning, ect.) and dealing with my cat in hospital so I ended up asking him to just put my unfolded laundry in the dresser my clothes go in (there is definitely space, my laundry that was left there was literally 1 pair of pants and a couple pairs each of underwear and socks) but he replied to that with ""I‚Ä¶ guess I can :/"" and then ""Tbqh I actually really don‚Äôt want to?"" This broke me a bit because it feels like they can't even do this seemingly tiny thing for me. It's more complicated than that because they have expressed that they don't want to put away my laundry for me (not something I particularly like as a dynamic but I guess we can deal with our own laundry, not a deal breaker), but at the same time it feels like a convenient way of 'making' me come out to do this thing I said I would do when the situation and plans were different.

I wish he had just mentioned the laundry yesterday? Like if he was truly worried about embarrassing me just text me about it instead of saying it out loud? This has just really rubbed me the wrong way and I guess I want other people's opinions on it because I don't quite know how I should feel...

TL;DR: My partner didn't want to put away a very small amount of my laundry, unfolded. This seems to me to be a very small ask given that my cat is in the veterinary hospital recovering from emergency surgery and I could use a modicum of support beyond just nice words.",1,1739117209.0,relationships,0,0.99,False

The breaker popped about every 1 in 5 or so starts. Always immediately at turn on, never after starting Nothing else on that circuit turned on. Reset and the microwave worked fine. I thought either the breaker is going bad or there is a problem in the microwave.

I swapped out the breaker, and the problem mostly went away, perhaps once in 20 or 30 starts. Seems unlikely that two breakers were bad, though. I was going to get a new microwave, which otherwise works fine.

I can run both the microwave and the toaster oven simultaneously without anything popping. 

A few days ago the breaker popped starting the toaster oven. Reset, worked fine. Next day, same thing. The microwave was off both times. I have turned the toaster on/off at least a dozen times in the last few days, only popped twice.

I can imagine a microwave might have a largish starting load charging capacitors or something, but a basic electric resistance toaster would not have any surge loading at all.

I have used other appliances on this circuit, such as mixer, coffee grinder, food processor, and never have had issues.

All the outlets are GFCI, but no GFI errors ever. Just the breaker in the panel pops.

Until the toaster pooped the breaker, I assumed I had to replace the microwave. If so, why would the  toaster pop the breaker, too.

The only other item on the circuit are the LED under-cabinet lights. I have double checked that there is no other secret load.

I tightened the wires in the panel. Some neutrals were slightly loose, but none so loose to be suspicious to me.

Could a receptacle be the cause? Unlikely two different receptacles would crap out the same time.

If you‚Äôre not familiar with it, it‚Äôs basically an app to help you meet new people/friends. You can opt in or out on a given Wednesday for a 10 AM meet up on the following Saturday with a random group of 2-4 people at a coffee shop.

I guess my questions are: 

1) Does anyone know of something that‚Äôs similar that has options for helping me meet new people on weeknights? 

I imagine with practice, I will be become better at doing this organically out in the wild, but something like Mesh makes the process much easier/manageable for me for now.

2) Related, I love coffee shops, but I wondered if there is something like Mesh but instead matches you up with people for a randomish event, such as bowling, hiking, axe throwing, board games, yoga, foodie events, etc.

I know there are dedicated groups for these individual types of things - and I may just join a bunch - but I like the idea of something that is about getting people outside of their comfort zones and constantly exposing us to new things we might not have realized we like.

1ilhyj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestCoffeeTables/comments/1ilhyj5/wlive_acj009pl_coffee_table_review_with_hidden/,WLIVE ACJ009PL coffee table review with hidden storage and lift-top design,"I‚Äôve been using the WLIVE ACJ009PL coffee table for several months now, and as someone who constantly battles living-room clutter, this table has been both a blessing and a mild learning curve. Designed with practicality and aesthetics in mind, it has become a central part of my daily routine. From the moment I unpacked it, I could see how much thought went into its design. Its rustic oak finish gives it a mid-century modern vibe, making it a versatile fit for my living room d√©cor. The wood grain on the engineered wood top feels premium, though it‚Äôs clear this isn‚Äôt solid hardwood.

The compact size of this coffee table (39.37""D x 19.69""W x 16.93""H) makes it ideal for tighter spaces, like my apartment‚Äôs living room. At first, I was concerned it might seem too small, but its clever storage options made up for it. The primary feature‚Äîa lift-top mechanism‚Äîis both its biggest strength and its slightly annoying quirk. It allows the top to elevate to a floating height, transforming the table into a mini work or dining space. I often use it to work on my laptop or eat while binge-watching my favorite shows. However, the lift-top isn‚Äôt the smoothest; it wobbles slightly when extended, which can make balancing larger items tricky.

[Click here to see the price](https://decorgurus.com/product/wlive-acj009pl-coffee-table-review-b084zh1lyn/).

Hidden beneath the lift-top is a large compartment, perfect for storing remote controls, chargers, or even my throw blankets. I‚Äôve also made use of the adjustable shelves on the side, which are great for organizing books, board games, and other living-room essentials. The removable shelf feature is a thoughtful touch, allowing some flexibility depending on what you need to store. That said, the table does have a weight limit of 200 pounds, so you‚Äôll want to avoid overloading it.

Maintenance has been straightforward for the most part. The surface is resistant to light stains, but I wouldn‚Äôt test its limits with heavy spills. I‚Äôve found that using coasters religiously helps maintain its finish, as the engineered wood isn‚Äôt immune to scratches or water damage. Cleaning it is easy with a soft cloth, though the corners can collect dust more than I‚Äôd like.

Assembling the table was moderately challenging. While the instructions were clear enough, it still took me over an hour to put it together. The lift-top mechanism required the most attention, and I‚Äôd recommend enlisting a second person to help if possible. On the upside, the table feels decently stable once assembled, provided you‚Äôre not moving it around frequently. The straight-leg design contributes to its sturdiness, but I‚Äôd suggest lifting rather than dragging it to avoid stressing the legs.

**Pros**

* The lift-top design is a game-changer for multitasking, whether for work or dining.
* Generous hidden storage and adjustable shelves help keep the living area tidy.
* The rustic oak finish and mid-century modern style elevate the room‚Äôs aesthetic.
* Compact dimensions make it a great fit for smaller spaces.
* Straightforward cleaning and maintenance keep the table looking fresh.

**Cons**

* The lift-top mechanism can be wobbly, especially when fully extended.
* Assembly takes time and effort; not ideal for those who hate DIY furniture.
* The engineered wood finish feels delicate, requiring extra care to prevent scratches.
* Limited size may not be ideal for larger living spaces or those needing a bigger surface area.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to similar products like the Yaheetech Lift Top Coffee Table, the WLIVE ACJ009PL stands out with its more refined design and better storage options. While the Yaheetech table is often slightly more affordable, its design leans more utilitarian and lacks the mid-century charm of the WLIVE model. On the other hand, the WLIVE table falls slightly short against the SONGMICS Lift Top Coffee Table in terms of lift-top stability. The SONGMICS model has a smoother mechanism but comes at a steeper price point. If you prioritize aesthetics and storage over lift-top perfection, the WLIVE coffee table might be the better choice.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
For what it offers, the WLIVE coffee table is reasonably priced. It‚Äôs an excellent choice for those on a budget who still want a stylish, functional centerpiece for their living room. While it‚Äôs not a premium piece of furniture, its versatility and storage features make it a worthwhile investment. Just keep in mind that it‚Äôs better suited for moderate use rather than heavy-duty wear and tear.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ilhusq,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1ilhusq/preindoctrination_babies_unafraid_of_snakes_or/,Pre-indoctrination: babies unafraid of snakes or damnation,"Mormonism does its best to make itself the elephant in the room. In many cases, it has a head start of five to seven generations of early childhood indoctrination to make it the most important question in a believer's emotional landscape.

Humans are born with two instinctive fears: the fear of falling and the fear of loud noises. All other fears are learned. For a visceral demonstration, here's a video of [babies not being afraid of snakes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/s/yTYbqeH1Ig)

It's a good allegory, really. The parents watching the experiment on monitors from another room clearly go into fight-or-flight mode, especially when chubby toddler fingers start pinching the python's scales. One curious kiddo even leans down to try and bite this strange rope he has yet to learn to nope. 

The parents rationally know their kids are safe with a whole team of professional reptile handlers monitoring the experiment. The snakes aren't hungry for toddler, either, so the handlers have to work at keeping them on the carpet among the control toys the tots are playing with. But that doesn't stop the emotional reactions.

Over time, though, these kids are going to see how their parents react to snakes. It won't even take words; babies develop facial recognition bias around four months of age, letting them recognize their parents' faces from all angles and assign emotional context to their facial expressions. 

By the time the brain develops enough for a kid to start being aware of their past, they have a solid concept of what their parents did to survive into adulthood. This will determine how they feel about snakes and whether they see crickets, worms, or termites as gross or [a tasty snack.](https://proactivepestga.com/pest-control-blog/what-countries-eat-bugs/) 

Being raised Mormon might make the smell of coffee like the sight of a plate of grasshoppers. That's the tip of the indoctrination iceberg, of course. Instruction and example make it clear that avoiding mortal disasters and eternal damnation requires diqualifying experiences others see as healthy and normal. 

However, this sub is proof that the human brain is constantly confirming or updating its worldview with new data from the continuous flood of experience. Mormonism might program Mormons to simplify existence into right and wrong answers and mighty 180‚Å∞ changes of heart, but that's not how the neurology works.

Shelves break after cognitive dissonance between expectation and reality erodes the subconscious foundation beneath. (I think that's the most pretentious sentence I've written to date.) 

When I told my wife I couldn't Mormon anymore, she called her mom for support. Her mom saw figurative snakes and told her to kick me out of the house until I got my head on straight. My wife immediately told her HELL NO because our experiences together had shown her who I was and the direction I wanted our relationship and family to go.

There were still years of mixed-faith marriage, but Mormonism finally tripped itself in her mind after a bishop invalidated her decisions in an authority power play one Sunday. She realized Mormonism was stunting her life instead of saving it, so she replaced her underwear drawer by the following Wednesday. 

It will take time and experience to prove to your infoctrinated worldview and the believers in your life that Mormonism was crying wolf all along. But the elephant in the room is just a shadow puppet: real, valid emotions from insubstantial concerns over indoctrinated danger. 

Keep sight of the direction you want your life to go as you keep loving your family and living a good life. The experience will speak for itself.",3,1739116749.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

I'll hazard a guess at October. I used the cream off the top for coffee and made a bit of butter for S&G.   
I didn't do anything with the remaining milk outside of pondering what I might do with it, and leaving it in the gallon glass jar on the top shelf in my fridge.   
Sometimes things get to a point where I think

""It's not hurting anyone. Let's see what happens.""

Side note, if you leave a banana on the dash of your 86 Bronco for a year, it goes through some pretty interesting changes too.  
But I digress...

For the longest time it just looked like milk. Then a few weeks ago, maybe a month (I don't know. Time is weird.) there was a thin yellow layer of...fat(?) that separated out to the top. Okay. Now a few weeks later it looks as if the solids in the mild are, shrinking, congealing (?) into the center of the jar and getting more opaque, and the liquids are around that mass, less opaque. 

I have a largely unqualified theory that raw milk (the milk in question is raw) just turns into something different that's still edible.  
So I'm wondering:  
\~Is this edible?  
\~Is this a thing others do on purpose?  
\~If it is something others do on purpose, does it have a name? (So I could look deeper into it.)  
\~Does anyone double dog dare me to try some?\*  


I can attach a pic if that would help.

He was in an open marriage (which they had only been open for a month at that point) and I just wanted something casual but we both ended up falling in love to keep things short.

1ilhr0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1ilhr0t/is_logitech_mk345_the_best_wireless_keyboard_and/,Is Logitech MK345 the best wireless keyboard and mouse combo for everyday use? Read this review.,"Having used the Logitech MK345 Wireless Combo (model 920-006481) daily for a few weeks, I can confidently say it‚Äôs a practical option for those who want a reliable wireless keyboard and mouse setup. Whether you‚Äôre working from home, typing out long emails, or gaming casually, this set does the job‚Äîthough not without a few quirks.

The full-sized keyboard feels sturdy and comes with a palm rest, which my wrists thanked me for during marathon typing sessions. Keys are well-spaced, with a quiet clicky sound that‚Äôs satisfying but not disruptive; although, I did notice it‚Äôs slightly louder than some premium keyboards I‚Äôve tried. The spill-resistant design is a bonus for clumsy coffee drinkers like me. It's reassuring to know minor accidents won‚Äôt render the keyboard useless.

The mouse, on the other hand, is lightweight and fits comfortably in my right hand. It‚Äôs not oversized, so it‚Äôs easy to use for long periods without hand fatigue. However, the plastic surface can feel a bit slippery at times, especially during intense work or gaming sessions. That being said, its precise tracking and smooth scrolling make navigation easy. I‚Äôve used this on both my desk and a couch armrest, and it performed well on both.

What I really appreciated was the plug-and-play setup. The USB receiver worked instantly with my Windows laptop and even on my Chromebook‚Äîno drivers required. The wireless range is solid; I tested it across a 10-foot distance without any lag or drop in responsiveness. Battery life is another standout feature; Logitech claims up to three years for the keyboard and 18 months for the mouse. While I can‚Äôt confirm that yet, it‚Äôs a relief knowing I won‚Äôt have to constantly replace batteries.

[Click here to find Logitech MK345 on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/product/best-keyboard-mouse-combo-logitech-920-006481-review-tested-b00qxt5t3u/)

**Pros**

* **Comfortable Design:** The keyboard includes a palm rest, and the mouse is ergonomically contoured for right-handed use.
* **Impressive Battery Life:** Long-lasting batteries save you the hassle of frequent replacements.
* **Easy Setup:** Plug-and-play functionality without the need for additional software.
* **Durable and Spill-Resistant:** Great for everyday use in a variety of environments.
* **Good Wireless Range:** Reliable connectivity even at a distance of up to 10 meters.

**Cons**

* **Noisy Keyboard Keys:** Slightly louder than expected, which may bother some users.
* **Slippery Mouse Surface:** The lack of rubber grips can make it less secure in-hand.
* **Limited Functionality for Gamers:** Not ideal for high-performance gaming due to its simplicity.
* **No Backlit Keys:** Typing in low-light conditions could be challenging.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
I‚Äôve also tested other wireless combos like Dell KM636 and Microsoft Wireless Desktop 900. Compared to the Dell combo, the Logitech MK345 feels more ergonomic, particularly with its palm rest, but Dell‚Äôs keyboard is quieter and has a sleeker design. Microsoft‚Äôs combo offers quieter typing and a more premium feel overall, but its mouse lacks the precision of Logitech's. Neither competitor matches the battery life of the MK345, so if longevity is your priority, Logitech takes the crown. However, if customizable keys or a backlit keyboard are must-haves, you may want to explore higher-end models such as Logitech MX Keys Combo.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
This combo is reasonably priced for what it offers: durability, comfort, and excellent battery life. While it may not have flashy features like Bluetooth or backlit keys, it‚Äôs perfect for users looking for a solid, no-frills setup. Considering competitors in a similar price range, the MK345 provides better long-term value thanks to its reliability and minimal maintenance.

Would I recommend this for everyone? Not necessarily. If you‚Äôre a gamer or need advanced features, this combo might feel basic. However, for everyday tasks, casual office work, or even light entertainment, it‚Äôs a solid choice that won‚Äôt break the bank.

Our relationship has never been perfect - we did long distance during covid, I moved to live with him, fell into a deep depression, started going to therapy, eventually stopped but continued working through my stuff. My depression was brought on by a lot of things - family issues, pandemic, resentment for my relationship, feeling useless at work with no direction. I worked through a lot of it on my own with some support from my BF.

We get into really NASTY arguments and fights. At first they happened monthly/every other month and now they happen maybe every 2-3 months. Last year we had the WORST fight of all. He had recently gotten a gun and since getting the gun he would make threats of taking his life during our arguments. during this particular fight (on valentines day mind you) he made the same threat and I finally met his bluff. He proceeded to put the gun to his head and immediately put it down.

I called the cops and set an ultimatum for him. He had to give his parents the gun and go to therapy. It took him about a month to get rid of the gun. He told his parents he was struggling but nothing specific. He never booked solo therapy so I agreed to couples therapy with the agreement that he would do solo therapy once that ran out (EAP). We went to therapy together for 6 months. Our last session was 2 months ago and the anniversary of the argument is next week. Still, no solo therapy booked.

I feel like I am the only one keeping this relationship going. Even with couples therapy I had to bring it up for it to actually happen, if an appointment wasn't booked I had to bring it up for it to get done or we had to book right after our sessions. Along with his mental health, I have asked him to make his physical health a priority and at least get check ups done for hereditary conditions his brothers/parents get checked for regularly.

He does a lot of other things I think a good boyfriend would do - we go on dates, he buys me flowers, does chores around the house without me having to ask (for the most part), cooks for me, surprises me with breakfast or coffee, takes care of some of our finances, etc.

My boyfriend does a lot of things right, is a good person for the most part, and I think he actually cares about me and loves me BUT I feel like I have been lead on and manipulated. I'm not sure if this one thing is worth breaking up over when he does (almost) everything else (almost) right and things have gotten better with how we handle our arguments and process/communicate our feelings. I have a fear of regret when it comes to big life decisions and I don't want to end a relationship that could actually be a good thing and end up regretting it.

Am I in denial? OR is this worth saving and sticking out?! What else can I do to help him?

tl;dr boyfriend won't go to therapy despite me asking him after he threatened to take his life. Its been a year since. Everything else about our relationship is good but is it worth staying?",0,1739116176.0,relationships,7,0.17,False

Are you dreaming of a dazzling, white smile but wondering how long those pearly whites will stay bright? Teeth whitening has become increasingly popular, with many people seeking professional and at-home solutions to combat stains and discoloration. Understanding how long teeth whitening results last can help you make informed decisions about your oral care routine and manage your expectations. Whether you're considering over-the-counter strips, professional gel kits, or natural remedies, this comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about the duration of at-home teeth whitening treatments.

How Long Can You Expect Teeth Whitening Results to Last?

The longevity of teeth whitening results varies depending on several factors. On average, at-home teeth whitening treatments can provide results that last anywhere from 4 to 6 months, with some treatments maintaining brightness for up to a year. However, several key elements influence how long your newly whitened smile will remain vibrant.

Factors Affecting Teeth Whitening Duration

Different methods of teeth whitening come with varying result timelines:

1. Over-the-Counter Whitening Strips
- Typical duration: 3-4 months
- Average cost-effective option
- Results depend on initial tooth discoloration

2. Professional At-Home Gel Kits
- Lasting results: 4-6 months
- Custom-fitted trays for more consistent whitening
- Higher concentration of whitening agents

Types of At-Home Whitening Methods

Whitening Strips
**Whitening strips** are the most popular at-home teeth whitening method. These thin, flexible plastic strips are coated with a peroxide-based whitening gel and typically used for 30 minutes daily over 7-14 days. Most users experience noticeable results that last 3-4 months with proper maintenance.

Whitening Toothpastes
While not as intensive as other methods, whitening toothpastes can help maintain your bright smile. They work best as a supplementary treatment, potentially extending your whitening results by 1-2 months.

Natural Whitening Techniques
Some people explore natural methods like:
- Coconut oil pulling
- Baking soda treatments
- Apple cider vinegar rinses

These methods may provide mild whitening effects but are less consistent than professional treatments.

Maintaining Your Teeth Whitening Results

To maximize the longevity of your teeth whitening results, consider these expert tips:

1. Avoid Staining Foods and Drinks
- Limit coffee, red wine, and dark sodas
- Use a straw when drinking staining beverages
- Rinse mouth immediately after consuming dark-colored foods

2. Practice Excellent Oral Hygiene
- Brush teeth twice daily
- Floss regularly
- Use whitening toothpaste for maintenance

3. Touch-Up Treatments
- Perform touch-up whitening every 3-4 months
- Use maintenance kits to preserve brightness

Potential Side Effects and Considerations

While teeth whitening is generally safe, some individuals might experience:
- Temporary tooth sensitivity
- Gum irritation
- Uneven whitening

Consult with a dental professional if you experience prolonged discomfort or unusual symptoms.

Cost Considerations

At-home teeth whitening options range from:
- Budget strips: $20-$40
- Professional kits: $100-$200
- Advanced systems: $200-$500

Investing in a quality whitening method can provide more consistent and longer-lasting results.

When to Seek Professional Advice

Some situations warrant professional dental consultation:
- Severe tooth discoloration
- Existing dental work
- Sensitive teeth
- Inconsistent whitening results

Professional dentists can provide personalized recommendations tailored to your specific dental needs.

1ilhix8,https://www.reddit.com/r/herbalism/comments/1ilhix8/do_any_herbs_interact_adversely_with_adhd/,Do any herbs interact adversely with ADHD methylphenidate meds?,"I started ADHD meds last July, following my adult dx. 

Elvanse/ Vyvanse (one of the amphetamine family) made me horribly depressed, did nothing for the ADHD, and had a ton of nasty side effects like muscle and bone pain and weakness, plus intractable insomnia.

Concerta (an extended release methylphenidate) did bugger all positive, until I was put on a big enough dose to make a difference (54mg morning, 27mg lunchtime/ afternoon, at which point I had terrible side effects again.

Was switched randomly to Medikinet, another methylphenidate, because of Concerta shortages here last October, and thankfully Medikinet has been a lot more positive for me.

I got that URTI bug that‚Äôs doing the rounds (in the UK, some people are calling it the ‚Äú100 day cough‚Äù), all over Christmas.

I wasn‚Äôt drinking a lot of herbal teas before that, but I drank pints and pints of mullein tea to get rid of the cough, which it did a great job of.

Since then, I‚Äôve been drinking more herbal tea than I did before, including continuing to drink mullein tea because I like it. 

My Medikinet, which had been working just fine for 3 months, we were just refining the daily dose and timings of those, seems to either not work at all, or sends me spiralling into paralysing anxiety instead. 

Before, I just had clean, clear-headed energy from my morning Medikinet.


Is there any relationship between my methylphenidate not working like it was, and me drinking mullein tea every day, or is this just a coincidence? 

I admit I seem to have replaced coffee with mullein tea, and have an infuser mug first thing in the morning, then at least one big pot of it a day, usually around tea-time, and sometimes extra infuser mugs of it during the day. 

I have it with pieces of lemon, and set honey. 

I also reacted badly to chamomile tea recently, which I‚Äôve had tons of times before ADHD meds without any problems. 

Are my herbs and my methylphenidate meds rubbing each other up the wrong way?

Due to circumstances, I was asked to attend church today. One I‚Äôd never been to, and I was willing to give it a chance. Immediately, I was grossed out - it was like a stadium or a concert. Bright lights, swelling music, all meant to invoke emotion. When the ‚Äúservice‚Äù started, it was actually just *SIX* songs, each growing more and more emotional, before the sermon. It felt very manipulative, and I had flashbacks of ‚Äúfeeling God‚Äôs presence‚Äù in Christian retreats as a teen.

Then the sermon was all about Christians being persecuted. It quoted Paul in 2nd Corinthians, as if modern day Christians were being persecuted like they were by the Romans. The whole time I felt so uncomfortable and like I was actively being brainwashed - or watching it happen to the people around me. I couldn‚Äôt leave fast enough, despite all the genuinely kind seeming people who wanted to introduce themselves and offers of coffee after the service.

It just felt so overwhelmingly concocted - let‚Äôs make this *feel* emotional so they‚Äôll think it‚Äôs God. It made me remember being a child/ teen/ young adult praying alone in bed for God to show himself so I‚Äôd know he was real and I was saved - only to never be able to recreate that feeling of ‚ÄúGod‚Äù that I felt in church.

The defense is always ""I bought something, so I should be able to sit there for as long as I want.""

Sure, but no one can then sit down and socialize, and everyone else who walks in just has to buy one thing and leave.

This desk has been a reliable addition to my setup, and after a few weeks of use, I‚Äôve gathered some solid insights into its design, functionality, and overall value.

**Design & Comfort**

The design of this desk is minimalist yet modern, which makes it a versatile option for most spaces. Its natural wood finish on the engineered wood top, paired with the sturdy alloy steel frame, adds a touch of elegance without feeling overbearing. The materials feel high-quality and durable‚Äîfar superior to many particleboard alternatives I‚Äôve encountered. I appreciate that the desk is smooth to the touch and resistant to scratches, which is a blessing when you have a habit of dragging coffee mugs across it.

[Check Zinus Jennifer 55 Inch Desk price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/product/zinus-jennifer-55-inch-desk-review-olb-dt-5524w-b075f9ktqw/)

At 29 inches tall, the desk provides a comfortable working height, though it doesn‚Äôt come with height adjustability. If you‚Äôre particular about ergonomic posture, pairing it with an adjustable chair or a separate wrist support is a good idea. While there‚Äôs no built-in keyboard tray, the ample surface area makes it easy to position your peripherals in a way that feels natural.

**Size & Space**

Measuring 55 inches wide, 24 inches deep, and 29 inches high, the desk offers a generous workspace without being bulky. I‚Äôve managed to fit a dual monitor setup, a laptop, a lamp, and a few knick-knacks on it without feeling crowded. The rectangular shape ensures it fits snugly in corners or against walls, making it suitable for compact home offices or larger rooms.

The legroom underneath is surprisingly spacious. As someone who likes to stretch while sitting, I‚Äôve found the open frame design to be a great feature. It‚Äôs also tall enough to slide a small filing cabinet or storage boxes underneath, which helps keep my workspace tidy.

**Functionality & Features**

This desk keeps things simple, which is both a strength and a limitation. It doesn‚Äôt come with drawers, shelves, or cable management options, so you‚Äôll need to get creative with storage and organization. Personally, I stuck adhesive cable clips to the underside of the desk to keep my wires neatly tucked away. If you‚Äôre a fan of DIY solutions, the desk‚Äôs solid build can handle modifications like drilled holes for cable routing or monitor arms.

One nice touch is the included rubber feet, which help prevent scratches on hardwood floors and keep the desk stable on uneven surfaces. While I wouldn‚Äôt call it a ‚Äúfeature-rich‚Äù desk, its straightforward design is part of the charm. It‚Äôs a blank canvas for creating the setup you want.

**Assembly**

Assembling this desk was a breeze. The parts were labeled clearly, and the instructions were some of the best I‚Äôve encountered. Zinus even includes a handy ratcheting Allen wrench, which made the process faster and less frustrating. It took me under 30 minutes to put everything together by myself, though having an extra set of hands might be helpful for aligning the frame.

**Pros**

* **Sturdy Build:** The alloy steel frame and engineered wood top feel solid and can hold up to 100 pounds of evenly distributed weight.
* **Simple Assembly:** The included tools and clear instructions make setup quick and stress-free.
* **Modern Aesthetic:** The natural wood finish and clean lines fit a variety of styles, from modern to rustic.
* **Spacious Surface:** Plenty of room for work essentials without feeling cramped.
* **Great Value:** High-quality materials and design at an affordable price.

**Cons**

* **No Storage:** Lack of built-in drawers or shelves means you‚Äôll need additional storage solutions.
* **Limited Features:** Missing elements like cable management or adjustable height might be a turnoff for some.
* **Non-Customizable:** The desk doesn‚Äôt offer modular options, so what you see is what you get.
* **Shipping Delays:** Some users report longer-than-expected shipping times, so plan accordingly.
* **Surface Texture:** While good for most tasks, the slight texture might not be ideal for drafting or writing without a pad.

**Comparison to Competitors**

When compared to similar desks, the Zinus Jennifer stands out for its simplicity and build quality. For instance, the IKEA Linnmon desk is a popular choice in a similar price range, but it often feels less stable due to its hollow construction. On the other hand, desks like the VariDesk Pro Plus offer features like adjustable height but at a much steeper price point.

While the Zinus desk doesn‚Äôt have bells and whistles, it excels in areas that matter most for a basic workstation. It‚Äôs sturdier than budget options like the Mainstays Parsons desk and more affordable than premium brands like Herman Miller. If you want a solid, no-frills desk that won‚Äôt break the bank, this is a fantastic choice.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Given its quality and durability, the Zinus Jennifer 55 Inch Desk is a great investment for those who need a reliable workspace. It‚Äôs not the cheapest desk out there, but it offers excellent value for the price. The materials and construction feel like they‚Äôll hold up for years, which isn‚Äôt something I can say about every desk I‚Äôve tested.

While you might need to spend a little extra on storage or ergonomic accessories, the overall cost remains reasonable. It‚Äôs versatile enough to double as a dining table or craft station, which adds to its appeal.

No no. Nothing like this. My wife cannot have a single taste of anything caffeine related. Coffee? Fussy baby. Latte? Very fussy baby. Boba tea? You guessed it, fussy baby. Always at night, and it doesn't matter when she drinks. She has can a couple sips of my coffee in the morning and sure enough, that night our baby (7 weeks now) won't sleep well. Which is weird because she naps fine during these day usually.

We test this about once a week and it's always the same, no matter what drink, no matter how little quantity (she used a spoon and stuck her tongue in the latte she made me yesterday afternoon and we once again have a rough night), or what time, any small amount of caffeine that gets to our baby wakes the dragon.

The first few times I adamantly didn't believe this was real, because A she always drank so little and B it was usually in the morning, so how could it possibly be affecting her at night? But its like clockwork, the only rough nights we have are when my wife has even what probably adds up to 10mg of caffeine or less at any point in the day.

Breakfast: 

Ham, egg white and cheddar wrap/quesadilla with either a black tea or a cup of coffee 

Lunch

Either a salad with grilled chicken or Greek artisan snack box that's filled with hummus, cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices, pita bread, grilled chicken, and feta

Dinner

Veggie pasta of some sort with grilled chicken or a wrap. 

For workout, I did 33:55 of bicep/arm curl yesterday at 80lbs.

Now, my math maybe off when it comes to calorie intake. The breakfast wrap is 270 cal with the coffee at 85 cal

The snack box is 500 cal ( Ya, I know! It's more like a meal ) and the salad is about 400 cal as well. 

The veggie pasta does variety, but most of the time it's 340 by itself ( I get the birds eye steamable bags ) and 110- 150 for grilled chicken ( I sometimes put a little extra.

I don't know the burn for bicep curls or anything like that, but I do walk a lot. I'm talking 2 or 3 hours due to the job I work.

1ilh4dr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Codependency/comments/1ilh4dr/coda_not_what_i_thought/,CoDA not what I thought,"I feel like this 12 step Codependent Recovery program just made me worse. 

TLDR: I‚Äôm not sure if it is the program itself or just my bad choice of sponsor. I was fired by my sponsor yesterday because I didn‚Äôt complete my first amends email within 48 hours. 

I was disturbed by some things that were said during my moral inventory. Like that I was selfish for being angry that someone roophied me and tried to rape me. Or that  I was selfish that a somatic coach tried to groom me and take advantage of me at a retreat, while I was in a vulnerable position processing really heavy trauma - where we all signed contracts that 0 sexual energy was allowed to keep people safe - I was told it was my fault because I signed up for the experience and it was unrealistic to expect the coaches to follow rules or the guardians to protect us and do their jobs. Or that my childhood - where I was abused everyday for the first 18 years of my life - had NOTHING to do with my adult relationship choices.

When I questioned this I was told that this isn‚Äôt a feelings program and if I disagreed maybe I didn‚Äôt belong there. I didn‚Äôt want to get kicked out, so I shut up. I‚Äôm suicidal and desperate as it is and I want to get better. I was also told therapy might interfere with the program and that I might need to quit therapy, and the program should be put above all other things in my life.

I didn‚Äôt realize steps 5-8 would be done all in one sitting, I wasn‚Äôt told that ahead of time and my sponsor picked an evening time. But I wanted to follow program so despite being up since 5 am I stayed up and meditated for the hour after the inventory, said the prayers and then had coffee so I could stay up and work on my categorized amends list which I finished sometime after 11 pm after hours of reliving all my trauma. I didn‚Äôt sleep at all that Sunday night.

Then the next day we went through my amends list and I was told to send my first amends email to sponsor within couple days for approval. That was Monday evening. But that week my ex-addict‚Äôs mom called me out of the blue and told me he‚Äôd been missing for a week which triggered my PTSD and on top of me not being able to get my meds, having a new job, not sleeping - I lost control and relapsed and called him and he didn‚Äôt answer and I was suicidal to the point where I booked an emergency session with my therapist and thought about checking into a hospital. I was still attending the program calls every night they were available and missed hanging with my best friend to attend an all day workshop Saturday.

I reached out to my sponsor when I relapsed and told her what happened, about my shame, depression, suicidal ideation and that my ex who I love but who also abused me and I left may be dead or in jail or in the hospital. She took 2 days to get back to me and told me only that I didn‚Äôt follow instructions (getting an email back in 48 hours) so therefore I wasn‚Äôt working program, wasn‚Äôt willing to go to any lengths and she couldn‚Äôt helped me and she fired me.

Now I am more depressed and hopeless than when I started. I feel even more strongly that I am broken, I feel even more guilt and shame about having feelings, and that despite me giving absolutely everything I can to something and sacrificing my mental health for it - it will never be enough. The opposite of my healing goals.

I thought the program was passionate about helping sick people, but it seems more like about control and forcing you to do things exactly their way or otherwise you are punished and shamed. Which is you know, exactly what my abusers did and how I ended up codependent in the first place.

I called others in program and they confirmed that it was protocol to drop a sponsee if they didn‚Äôt complete their first amends within 24-48 hours immediately after doing steps 5-8 (in one sitting). So I guess I‚Äôm sorry that me going to calls everyday, all day workshops, sacrificing sleep to push through steps 5-8 at once, missing time with loved ones, using my breaks at work to read big book and thinking to drop therapy wasn‚Äôt enough to prove I‚Äôm loyal to the program‚Ä¶

When my sponsor fired me I apologized to her and thanked her for her time and effort.

Guys, am I crazy?

My husband and I are retired and leaving Oregon this summer to move to Colorado to be closer to our kids in Denver. We are retired, so schools/jobs not a factor for us. We were initially looking at Fort Collins (visited last summer). Loved the old town charm and shaded areas to walk our dog. Reminded us of the big trees we have here in Oregon. But‚Ä¶definitely a bit more of a drive to Denver and we‚Äôve heard that traffic can be horrendous there during the CSU school year. 
So‚Ä¶now looking at Longmont as an alternative (closer to Denver but not too close haha). We like the proximity to Estes Park and Boulder. Have heard the farmers market in Longmont is really nice (went to the one in Fort Collins last summer and it didn‚Äôt compare to our farmer‚Äôs market here in Bend, OR). So yes farmer‚Äôs markets are a big love for us. Also shaded walks, healthy restaurants, coffee shops, artsy, cultural vibe, cute downtown, safe place to live etc..also important to us. We haven‚Äôt completely ruled out Fort Collins (that Old Town shaded area really touched my soul), but thinking Longmont might have more quiet/less traffic for us.

As someone who relies heavily on coffee to jumpstart my day, I was intrigued by the idea of an all-in-one coffee maker with a built-in grinder. The Capresso 465 promised fresh, customizable coffee with minimal effort, and I was eager to put it through its paces. This machine, with its stainless steel carafe and conical burr grinder, seemed like a match made in coffee heaven. But, as they say, the devil is in the details.

The design of the Capresso 465 immediately caught my eye. It has a sleek, modern appearance with a relatively compact footprint for a machine that combines brewing and grinding. The stainless steel thermal carafe is a nice touch, keeping coffee warm without the need for a warming plate‚Äîa feature I found particularly appealing since it eliminates the risk of burnt coffee. However, the water reservoir lacks a sight glass, making it nearly impossible to see how much water you've added without using a flashlight. This became a daily annoyance for me.

[Check Capresso 465 CoffeeTeam TS price on Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/capresso-465-coffeeteam-ts-review-b002qg0rrc/)

Performance-wise, I found the grinder to be both a blessing and a curse. The conical burr grinder offers even grinding, and the aroma of freshly ground beans in the morning is undeniably satisfying. That said, the grinder is loud enough to wake the whole house. My kids jokingly nicknamed it ""the coffee tornado."" Additionally, the machine struggles with oily beans, such as French or Italian roasts, which can jam the grinder. I had to switch to a lighter roast to avoid constant frustrations.

**Brewing quality** is where the Capresso 465 shines. The machine produces consistently hot coffee, and the strength settings allow for some customization. My colleagues who stopped by for morning meetings agreed the coffee was smooth and flavorful, although not quite as rich as what you'd get from a high-end espresso machine. That said, the brewing process isn't without quirks. The coffee grounds often accumulate unevenly in the filter basket, leaving some grounds dry and unused. This inefficiency means you might go through beans faster than anticipated.

Cleaning and maintenance are a mixed bag. The thermal carafe and filter basket are easy to rinse out, but the grinder requires regular cleaning to prevent clogs, especially if you stray back to those oily beans. The manual advises drying out beans on a paper towel before grinding, but honestly, who has time for that in the morning?

**Pros**

* Sleek design with a stainless steel carafe that keeps coffee hot.
* Freshly ground coffee adds an unbeatable aroma and taste.
* Customizable strength and cup settings provide flexibility.

**Cons**

* Grinder struggles with oily beans and is quite noisy.
* Lack of a sight glass for the water reservoir is inconvenient.
* Grounds often accumulate unevenly, reducing brewing efficiency.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
When compared to similar grind-and-brew machines, such as the Cuisinart DGB-900BC or Breville Grind Control, the Capresso 465 holds its ground in terms of coffee flavor but falls short in user-friendliness. The Breville, for instance, offers a wider range of grind settings and a more intuitive interface, but it's also significantly pricier. The Cuisinart is more budget-friendly and easier to clean, but it doesn't reach the same level of brewing temperature consistency as the Capresso.

In terms of durability, the Capresso 465 seems to land in the middle. Some users report years of reliable performance, while others, like me, have encountered issues with the grinder within months. The machine's performance is commendable, but its tendency to struggle with certain beans and its occasional quirks make it less versatile than its competitors.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
The Capresso 465 sits in the mid-price range for grind-and-brew machines. While it offers good value in terms of coffee flavor and convenience, its design flaws and maintenance challenges may deter some buyers. For those willing to work around its quirks, it's a worthwhile investment. However, if you‚Äôre looking for a truly hassle-free experience, you might want to consider spending a bit more on a competitor's model or opting for a simpler machine with a separate grinder.

The programmable features are a highlight. I enjoyed waking up to fresh coffee without having to do anything but pour water and add beans the night before. The thermal carafe kept my coffee warm for hours, which was a lifesaver during busy work-from-home days.

1ilgsyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/suppgains/comments/1ilgsyy/preworkouts_demystified_how_to_use_them_for/,Pre-workouts demystified: how to use them for results,"So, you‚Äôve been eyeing pre-workouts but feel lost in the ingredient chaos.

You‚Äôre not alone.

From caffeine levels to nitric oxide boosters, these powders can feel like a science experiment in a tub.

Here‚Äôs everything you need to know, broken down into simple terms.

# What is a Pre-Workout?

Think of it as a power-up for your workout.

Pre-workouts are supplements designed to:

* **Boost energy**: Perfect for when you're dragging after a long day.
* **Enhance focus**: To keep distractions at bay and stay in the zone.
* **Increase endurance**: So you can push harder, longer.
* **Improve blood flow**: This helps deliver oxygen and nutrients to your muscles faster.

But not all pre-workouts are created equal.

Some give you crazy energy.

Others focus on pumps or mood.

# Common Pre-Workout Ingredients (And What They Do)

**1. Caffeine**  
The OG energy booster.

* **How it works**: Stimulates your central nervous system, increasing alertness and reducing fatigue.
* **Ideal dose**: 150-300mg (roughly 1-3 cups of coffee).
* **Watch out**: Too much can lead to jitters or crashes.

**2. L-Citrulline**  
The pump king.

* **How it works**: Boosts nitric oxide production, improving blood flow to your muscles.
* **Benefits**: Better endurance and muscle pumps.
* **Optimal dose**: 4-8g per serving.

**3. Beta-Alanine**  
The endurance enhancer.

* **How it works**: Buffers acid buildup in your muscles, delaying fatigue.
* **Benefits**: Longer, harder workouts.
* **Side effect**: Tingling (totally harmless but annoying for some).

**4. Creatine**  
The strength builder.

* **How it works**: Replenishes ATP (your body‚Äôs energy currency).
* **Benefits**: Increased strength and power output.
* **Dose in pre-workouts**: Typically 2-5g.

**5. Theobromine**  
Caffeine‚Äôs chill cousin.

* **How it works**: Provides smoother energy without jitters.
* **Found in**: Chocolate and certain pre-workouts.

**6. Nitric Oxide Boosters (Beetroot, Arginine, Nitrates)**  
For pumps and performance.

* **How they work**: Increase blood flow, enhancing endurance and vascularity.
* **Great for**: High-rep or cardio-heavy workouts.

**7. Nootropics (Lion‚Äôs Mane, Alpha-GPC)**  
The brain boosters.

* **How they work**: Improve focus and mental clarity.
* **Benefits**: Helps you stay locked in during tough sets.

# How to Take Pre-Workouts for Best Results

**1. Timing is Everything**  
Take your pre-workout 20-30 minutes before training.

Why? It needs time to kick in.

**2. Start Small**  
If you‚Äôre new to pre-workouts, begin with half a scoop.

Gauge your tolerance before jumping to a full dose.

**3. Don‚Äôt Overdo It**  
More isn‚Äôt better.

Taking too much can lead to:

* Sleeplessness
* Anxiety
* Digestive issues

Stick to the recommended dosage.

**4. Stay Hydrated**  
Some pre-workouts (especially those with creatine or beta-alanine) can dehydrate you.

Drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout.

**5. Cycle Off Stimulants**  
If you‚Äôre taking a high-caffeine pre-workout, give your body a break every 6-8 weeks.

This prevents tolerance and keeps the effects strong.

# Who Should (and Shouldn‚Äôt) Use Pre-Workouts

**Pre-workouts are great if you:**

* Need energy to crush an intense workout.
* Struggle with focus or motivation in the gym.
* Want better endurance or pumps.

**But avoid them if you:**

* Are sensitive to caffeine or stimulants.
* Train late at night (unless it‚Äôs a stim-free version).
* Have heart or blood pressure issues (always consult a doctor first).

# Key Takeaways

* **Caffeine** gives energy, but balance it to avoid jitters.
* **L-Citrulline** is your go-to for muscle pumps.
* **Beta-Alanine** improves endurance but may cause tingles.
* **Start small** and adjust based on your tolerance.

Pre-workouts aren‚Äôt magic.

They‚Äôre tools to help you train harder.

1ilgssq,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ilgssq/i_left_grad_school_to_pursue_a_trade_and_now_am/,I left grad school to pursue a trade and now am second guessing myself. What should I do?,"I really need some advice to get my shit together. I am a 29 year old male living on the east coast. TL;DR at bottom

I have bounced around a lot in my career. Went to college, was in sales at small/mid tech companies for a while, did operations at a large communications company, and finally was a data analyst at an insurance company. Ended up at a back-breaking warehouse job to make ends meet when I couldn't find an office job with my skills and the money ran out. All these jobs were between 6 months and at most 1 year; I was never fired but I find it soul-crushing to work in an office environment. I'm not good at the politics, at small talk, at advocating for myself. Showing up at some cubicle everyday and dealing with the same mundane bullshit was really messing with my head. The only jobs I've managed to keep for close to or more than a year have been either fully remote or mostly remote, and even those I mostly tolerated because I needed the money. It was like, okay, I don't like this admin role where I'm basically filling out forms and checking boxes, but I'm making enough money, and I can go to the grocery store in the middle of the day, and save for a few meetings I'm mostly left alone. That was enough for me, but those jobs are hard to come by post-pandemic.

I went to grad school for a semester to pursue CS, but AI has pretty much wiped out all the entry level jobs and it was insanely expensive so I decided to leave. A large factor in deciding to leave was my therapist encouraging me to learn a trade and join a union. That maybe I wasn't cut out for office work to begin with, and that I would be happier/ able to hold something down if it was a more physically active job with less corporate speak.

I dropped out in December, and since have been applying to unions, but it seems like my chances of getting in are slim and the process is very long. The IBEW in my area will take a year for me to even get tested, and best case scenario I'd start working in summer 2026. If I don't get in I will have to apply again and wait another year at least. The other trades I could see myself in have similar stories: I have been calling the carpenters union about my application from December but they ""do not offer timelines"", the pipefitters take applications for 2 weeks a year, and only up to 200 applicants. Of those 35-40 will get chosen. It could be years or simply never happen.

Trade school is in my purview but with the debt from grad school and the lower wages from switching to blue collar, it would put a big strain on my finances. Plus, the difference in union vs. non-union tradesmen in compensation so is so big it makes it WAY less worthwhile to be in the field if you're not in the union. The difference in lifetime earnings is in the millions of dollars. I have crunched the numbers.

The kicker is I was at my cousins place this weekend who's a former electrician and now in construction management. He wasn't discouraging, but he didn't exactly make it seem like it was a good idea. He kept telling me how difficult these jobs are, how much less I'll get paid, trying to convince me to do something in management with him - which is super nice, but I am try to get the fuck out of fluorescent lighting, gray walls, shit coffee, and Jim holding me hostage to talk about disc golf.

This all has me questioning what the fuck I'm doing. It was difficult to explain to my friends and parents that after another 10 years in some bullshit office making spreadsheets I would likely kill myself or buy a corvette and live out the rest of my days as a sex pest in Thailand. But when people in this line of work are telling me I'm crazy I'm starting to believe it. With the precariousness of getting into a union it has me thinking this may not be a wise decision.

Should I just nut up, lie on my resume a little like everyone else, get something where I can support myself and accept this is my life? I'm not void of skills but it's been extremely difficult for me to find jobs every time, and I don't even want them once I get them. But I'm at a loss here. I don't want to accept that most of my life will be spent crunching numbers behind a computer screen but I don't know if I can make something else work and I need to get by. It's embarrassing enough to be moving back into your parents house at 29, and I'm now in more debt than I've ever been.

I can't keep jumping around. I have promised myself that the next thing I do I will stick to regardless of what it is. My friends are getting better jobs, getting promoted, traveling the world. I'm stuck at home. I don't want to be in this situation in five years because I didn't put the time in.

Thank you for any responses and I apologize for the word vomit.

TL;DR: College educated but hate office work/culture/everything. Trying to get blue collar job through union but is not easy and will likely be struggling financially if I go to trade school. Should I keep trying or 'grow up' and accept the office for what it is?",1,1739113937.0,jobs,4,1.0,False
1ilgs1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/skincaredevices/comments/1ilgs1p/a_practical_review_of_verilux_vt31ww3_happylight/,A Practical Review of Verilux VT31WW3 HappyLight Lumi Therapy Lamp,"I‚Äôve been using the Verilux HappyLight Lumi VT31WW3 every day for the past few weeks, and honestly, it has become an integral part of my morning routine. As someone who works long hours indoors and lives in an area with gloomy winters, I find the lack of natural sunlight incredibly draining. This compact, UV-free LED therapy lamp promised to deliver up to 10,000 lux of light and improve my mood, focus, and energy levels. Naturally, I had to put it to the test.

The design of this lamp immediately caught my attention. It‚Äôs sleek, lightweight, and about the size of an iPad mini, making it incredibly portable. The detachable stand is a thoughtful addition, and it can also be wall-mounted if needed. I often move it between my home office and bedroom, and the portability is a huge plus. The materials feel durable, and the smooth finish adds a modern touch. However, I did find myself wishing that the lamp had the option to rotate or adjust to landscape orientation. This could make its placement even more versatile.

[Check Verilux VT31WW3 HappyLight Lumi price on Amazon.](https://agegene.com/product/verilux-vt31ww3-review-with-asin-b07td96k5t/)

Operating the lamp is straightforward. It features a simple push-button power control, along with touch-sensitive brightness adjustments that let you toggle between three brightness levels. I usually use the middle setting in the mornings while sipping my coffee, as the highest setting feels too intense if I sit too close. The 10,000 lux claim seems valid, as the brightness is nothing short of blinding if you look directly at it. A word of advice‚Äîposition the lamp slightly above or to the side of your face to avoid discomfort.

The light emitted is bright white and UV-free, which is a relief for those concerned about prolonged exposure. Unlike older models or other brands I‚Äôve tried in the past, there‚Äôs no visible flicker, and my eyes don‚Äôt feel strained after use. I also appreciate that this lamp uses full-spectrum LED light, as it mimics natural daylight quite effectively. The absence of a timer is something I miss, though. It would be handy to have an automatic shutoff feature for those rushed mornings when I forget to turn it off.

In terms of size and weight, it‚Äôs almost perfect for a therapy lamp. Weighing just 1.1 pounds and standing at 9 inches tall, it fits easily on my desk or nightstand without taking up much space. I‚Äôve even taken it to my coworking space a few times, and no one seemed to notice‚Äîit could easily be mistaken for a tablet. However, I do wish it came with a carrying case for travel, as it feels a bit exposed when I toss it into my backpack.

Safety-wise, this lamp is well thought out. It‚Äôs UV-free, which makes it safe for daily use, and it‚Äôs medically certified for light therapy. However, I did notice that it gets warm after prolonged usage, though not alarmingly so. Still, it‚Äôs something to keep in mind, especially if you‚Äôre placing it near sensitive materials.

**Pros**

* Compact and portable design, easy to move between rooms.
* Three adjustable brightness levels up to 10,000 lux.
* UV-free, full-spectrum LED light for safe and effective therapy.
* Simple, intuitive controls with no learning curve.
* Detachable stand and wall-mounting option add versatility.

**Cons**

* Lacks a timer for automatic shutoff.
* No landscape orientation for alternate setup options.
* Can feel too bright if placed too close.
* Gets slightly warm after extended use.
* No travel case included.

**Comparison to Competitors**

I‚Äôve used similar light therapy lamps, like the Carex Day-Light Classic Plus and the TaoTronics LED Lamp, and each has its strengths. The Carex model offers a broader light panel and is more adjustable, but it‚Äôs bulky and less portable. On the other hand, TaoTronics provides a timer and multiple color temperature options, but its build quality feels cheaper compared to the Verilux HappyLight Lumi. This lamp strikes a sweet spot between portability, brightness, and durability, though it doesn‚Äôt offer as many advanced features as some competitors. For those prioritizing portability, this is hard to beat.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

The price of the Verilux HappyLight Lumi VT31WW3 positions it as a mid-range therapy lamp. While it doesn‚Äôt come with all the bells and whistles of high-end models, its build quality, effective brightness, and portability make it worth the investment. If you‚Äôre looking for a reliable daily-use lamp without spending too much, this strikes a good balance. Keep in mind that prices can fluctuate, so it‚Äôs worth checking for deals before purchasing.

To summarize, the Verilux HappyLight Lumi VT31WW3 delivers on its promise of bright, UV-free light therapy in a design that fits seamlessly into everyday life. While it could be improved with a timer and more setup flexibility, it‚Äôs an excellent choice for anyone battling seasonal affective disorder, winter blues, or simply a lack of sunlight due to indoor work environments.

I‚Äôve 16 and have never had a boyfriend. Basically men just have to do something nice for me and I‚Äôll think about them for the next few days. 

Example: I was in the metro station and had a problem, this guy helped me out for a couple of minutes. And for some reason I kept thinking about him till now. 

It‚Äôs really random things like that, and it happens on a daily basis. 
Example 2: I went to costa coffee this one day and the barista was exceptionally nice and said just for me he‚Äôd give it for free. The next day I woke up extra early just so I could go see him again. Crazy thing is I didn‚Äôt even find him physically attractive.

It gets worse when I have crushes.
They take up 90% of the things I think about and It takes weeks to go back to normal. Half of these crushes probably did really basic things for me to fall in love with them . i.e open the door for me/ basic compliments.

Recently I was on the phone with my aunt and she told me she was scared that I would be the type of person that would give my life up for a man. She thinks I‚Äôm in love with love ?? And that struck a nerve because my friends say the exact same thing

And what kills me is that I probably would as much as I deny it.

This small, non-lift top coffee table caught my eye for its compact design paired with functional storage options. After assembling and living with it, there‚Äôs a lot to unpack about its performance, design, and practicality.

The first thing that stood out to me was its clean, contemporary design. Made from engineered wood with a laminated finish, the table has a sleek Americano/Medium Brown color that fits effortlessly into both modern and minimalist aesthetics. Its petite size (18.9""D x 31.5""W x 15.6""H) makes it ideal for small spaces like apartments or dorm rooms. However, the downside of its size is that it may feel a bit too small for those who want a more commanding presence in their living room. I‚Äôve had guests comment on how ‚Äúcute‚Äù it looks, though that‚Äôs a double-edged compliment depending on your perspective.

Durability-wise, the medium-density composite wood feels sturdy enough for everyday use, though I wouldn‚Äôt recommend placing anything too heavy‚Äîlike an aquarium‚Äîon it. The table supports up to 25 pounds, which worked well for my books, a table lamp, and a couple of coffee mugs. However, I did notice a slight wobble when leaning on it, so if you‚Äôve got rambunctious children or pets, it might not be the most stable option.

The storage functionality on this coffee table is one of its standout features. It comes with two non-woven fabric drawers and a lower shelf. I‚Äôve used the fabric drawers to stash remote controls and magazines, while the open shelf is perfect for displaying decorative items. That said, the fabric drawers feel a bit flimsy and lack rigidity, which slightly detracts from the overall quality. I may replace them with sturdier bins in the future.

Maintenance has been a breeze. The laminated finish resists light stains and scratches, and I‚Äôve had no issues wiping it clean with a damp cloth. However, it‚Äôs not stain-resistant, so any spills should be cleaned promptly to avoid leaving marks.

Assembly was relatively straightforward. Despite the daunting number of pieces, it took me just under an hour with the help of a screwdriver and a bit of patience. The instructions could have been clearer, especially in identifying which side of the board should face out, but a little common sense helped me get through it. For those less experienced, having a second person might speed things up.

**Pros:**

1. Compact and stylish design that fits small spaces perfectly.
2. Convenient storage options with two drawers and an open shelf.
3. Affordable and budget-friendly.
4. Easy to clean and maintain.
5. Straightforward assembly once you understand the instructions.

**Cons:**

1. Relatively flimsy fabric drawers that lack durability.
2. Slight wobble reduces stability.
3. Smaller size may not suit larger living spaces.
4. Laminated finish isn‚Äôt fully stain-resistant.
5. Assembly instructions could be clearer for beginners.

Compared to competitors like the IKEA LACK coffee table, the Furinno 11158AM/MBR offers superior storage options thanks to its drawers and shelf. The IKEA option, while minimalist and equally affordable, lacks the same level of functionality. However, if stability and sturdiness are your top priorities, you might find the IKEA table a better fit. Another alternative, the SONGMICS Industrial Coffee Table, brings more industrial charm and durability but comes at a higher price point and larger dimensions, making it less suitable for smaller spaces.

For its price point, this coffee table delivers excellent value. While it isn't the most premium piece of furniture, it balances affordability with functionality and design. If you‚Äôre on a tight budget or need a practical table for a small apartment, you‚Äôll likely find it a worthwhile investment. It‚Äôs not without its flaws, but for what you pay, it does the job admirably.

1ilgjy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ilgjy4/how_do_i_interpret_this/,How do I interpret this?,"Hey guys, this is my first ever Reddit post, so apologies if I ramble on. 

I'm into a girl from my university society, I've only known her for a few months, but I really like her. 

We didn't really properly get to know each other until December 2024, even though we were in the same friendship group for a while. 
Some events happened that brought out my vulnerable side and the events involved misunderstandings with her, we got past it all and people think that her and I have become closer as a result.

I've found myself falling for her more and more recently. During those events in December, she revealed a bit about herself to me too, which was a surprise considering that she's normally quite a private person. 
She told me a small bit about her vulnerable side too, but not in as much detail as I did with her. 

During these incidents, she specified that she's never mad at me, and that she'll only be mad at me if I beat myself up over these mistakes I made and if I kept talking down about myself. She kept insisting that I don't need to do anything to make it up to her, as a result of my mistakes that I thought put her in a bad position. 

In general, she talks a lot more irl than over text, she's a rather dry texter but occasionally sends a bigger paragraph when she needs to. In general she doesn't really seem to DM many people and prefers group chats and servers instead. 

Since the start of the friendship group, she has always been among the first to laugh at my extremely dry, terrible jokes, call my name when I'm spacing out or just make references to inside jokes that involve me. Though the references and calling my name haven't been done as much in recent times. 

Back in early Jan, we went to a coffee shop together and drew art together which we traded, we spoke a fair bit about ourselves, her especially, I learnt quite a fair bit about her that day. She opened up to me about past friends she used to have, a little of her family situation and her relationships with her family.

I remember at the end of our coffee shop meetup, she said she'd beat me up if I ever thought she was mad at me again, that just made me fall for her even more. 

Recently, after December, she has been teasing me a lot more, making inside jokes about me, we both poke fun at each other in group chats and Discord servers, she sometimes calls me cringe as a joke as well because of things I say. 

I've noticed since the beginning, she sometimes stares at me a bit, though this doesn't seem frequent and maybe I might be overthinking it. 
A friend of mine who comes to our events also said to me a few times ""She keeps looking over at you."", I don't know how true this is.

In one of our more recent events, my friend made a paper knife which he gave to her, then she repeatedly began ""stabbing"" me with it and when someone made a joke about the knife making your ""stab victim"" brainwashed into falling in love with you, she just quickly looked down and said ""Uhhhhhh..."", might just be me overthinking it though, but that's what I remember. 

In this same event, my friend kept touching my hair and then when I looked to see who was doing it, he said that it was my crush who did it, to which she stared blankly at first and then according to my friend she said ""To be fair, I probably would touch his hair."" or something along those lines. I was over the moon when I heard that. 

During this event also, one of our other friends kept asking her questions about herself and she replied with ""I don't know you well enough to answer those for you."" or something like that. 

According to the friend who made the paper knife, he thinks that she just goes along with other guys in an effort to be polite, but with me she actually doesn't mind being close to me, she doesn't mind that I keep coming to sit next to her in events and whatnot. He thinks there are signs she might be into me. But I cannot see these signs. 

I've also heard of instances where when I'm not there, my brother has told me that she brings me up at times, like making jokes about me and other things. 

We often ""argue"" and ""disagree"" on a lot of things, but in a more comical manner than seriously going at each other, she has agreed with me on a few things, but these are rare. 

When I once made a joke about how ""she's the bane of my existence"", she responded with ""Awwww, am I that important to you? üòä"" and when someone else referenced it again, she responded with awwwww. 

One of her family members commonly gives her an endearing nickname, which she doesn't really like but when my brother made a joke about it, she said she wanted to throw up, yet when I called her that endearing nickname, she sob reacted the message and simply responded with ""*giggles*"", might be overthinking this though. 

There was once a situation where a creep was harassing her in one of our events, I told her that I'd deal with him if he came back.
The creep ended up coming back, and he went up to her again, but this time, I intervened and distracted him as well as hovering around her and making sure she was ok. 

When she found out that the reason I came was to check if she was okay, she thanked me quite a bit irl but then also randomly DM'd me to thank me again. She also found it extremely funny when I dealt with the creep by making him pretty annoyed in conversation. 

My only pitfalls are.... She can be quite dry on DM, but in general, she doesn't seem very well versed with technology. She also has spoken to me a bit less since the creep incident, although we did speak pretty normally yesterday. She doesn't really message first either unless there's something major that has happened. Though I've heard from other members of the group, that when they're alone with her, they struggle to speak to her too. And that they genuinely believe that right now, out of our 9 total group members (crush included), that I'd be in top 3 closest with my crush. 

She seems to reply more to my messages in a group chat or server rather than DM which she doesn't seem to be a fan of. 
She's more of someone who follows rather than leading too, so she'll never be the type to ask someone if they're free for a meetup. 

The past two times when I asked if she was free again on weekends, the first time she said she was unable to because of a course she had on one day. This time around, she said at first she'd be busy on the weekends but assured me that weekdays work better for her and we have seemingly got something arranged... Though I don't know how solid this plan is, but all seems fine for now. 

Another pitfall of mine... She's the type to get really attached to someone when she likes them according to herself, but I don't exactly think she's attached to me.... Though she seems to speak more about her teenage days here as she has matured quite a bit since then. 

Lastly, there was once a situation where she and another girl kept making jokes on one of our servers about me ""taking their breath away"" and ""charming them"". Eventually I find myself in a situation where I'm in some ""dating roleplay"" situation with her and she'd commonly react with these blush emojis... The friend from before even made a joke saying ""You're in love with him, we know."" she didn't reply to this message, but just blush reacted it... This was back in Jan though. 

When people keep making references to that time and ship us (not very often but still happens), I've never seen her flat out refuse or repulsed, instead she either has similar exaggerated reactions like mine or just ignores the messages completely.

Some friends think I'm winning this, but others think it's more of a sign of deepening friendship rather than mutual attraction, let me know what you guys think.

(Edit: Also forgot to add... That once in a group coffee shop meetup, when there was a free spot opposite me, she tried sitting on the far end alone instead until one of our friends told her to sit opposite me, to me she seemed a bit unsure about doing so...

Yesterday as well, when there was a free spot next to me, she hovered around for a bit and tried getting my other friend without a seat to sit there first, before everyone made her sit next to me instead... Which she also seemed unsure about....) ",1,1739113277.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

The Journey to Finding My Soulmate

**What Exactly is a Soulmate?**

Before diving into my personal story, let's explore what a soulmate truly means. A soulmate isn't just a perfect romantic partner, but someone who connects with you on a profound emotional, spiritual, and intellectual level. They complement your personality, understand your deepest thoughts, and support your dreams unconditionally.

**Signs You've Met Your Soulmate**

When I met my soulmate, several extraordinary things happened:

1. Instant emotional connection
2. Comfortable silence felt natural

4. Mutual respect and understanding
5. Feeling completely accepted

**The Unexpected Encounter**

My soulmate didn't arrive through a carefully planned dating strategy. Instead, we met unexpectedly at a local coffee shop during what seemed like an ordinary Tuesday afternoon. I was buried in paperwork, stressed from a challenging work week, when our eyes accidentally met.

**The First Conversation**

That initial conversation felt different from any interaction I'd experienced before. We discussed everything from childhood memories to professional aspirations, and time seemed to stand still. **Our connection was instantaneous and profound**, defying conventional romantic narratives.

**Emotional Synchronicity**

Researchers suggest that soulmate connections involve a unique form of emotional synchronicity. According to a psychological study, approximately 73% of individuals report feeling an inexplicable ""knowing"" when meeting their true partner.

**Navigating the Relationship**

Meeting a soulmate doesn't guarantee a perfect relationship. Like any partnership, it requires:

- Open communication
- Mutual respect
- Continuous personal growth
- Emotional vulnerability
- Shared commitment

**Overcoming Challenges Together**

Our relationship wasn't without challenges. However, our deep connection allowed us to navigate difficulties with empathy, understanding, and unwavering support.

**The Science of Soulmate Connections**

Neurological research indicates that soulmate connections trigger unique brain responses. When we're with our true partner, specific neural pathways activate, creating a sense of comfort, security, and profound belonging.

**Personal Transformation**

Meeting my soulmate wasn't just about finding a romantic partner‚Äîit was about personal evolution. Our connection inspired me to become a better version of myself, challenging my limitations and expanding my perspective.

**Embracing the Journey**

To those still searching, remember that soulmate connections aren't about perfection but about genuine, transformative love. Stay open, authentic, and patient.

**Final Reflections**

My soulmate journey taught me that true connection transcends conventional expectations. It's about finding someone who sees your authentic self, celebrates your uniqueness, and walks beside you through life's intricate landscape.

**Practical Advice for Soulmate Seekers**

- Stay true to yourself
- Cultivate self-love
- Remain open to unexpected connections

1ilggz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualIreland/comments/1ilggz5/looking_for_relationshipdating_advice/,Looking for relationship/dating advice,"So I‚Äôm in my early twenties, a lad.  A few months back I met a girl in the Macra one evening at the end of November. Instantly struck it off. Asked her for a coffee a few days later and we have been talking ever since. 

We went for drinks before club meetings and I when I was on business in the same town she‚Äôs working in we met for coffee again. There was chemistry straight away. My best friend in the Macra said that it was obvious that we were getting on very well together. We had been doing a play together with the rest of the group also. She had asked me to go for a drink before club meetings a few times aswell. So positive stuff. 

Before Christmas we were at an event and she drove and then recently we were at another event and I drove. Was a great time driving just just chatting away. We stopped for coffee on the way back. She started opening up to me about things that were going on with herself and the family or whatever. So I listened and tried to be a caring ear. We had a great chat. 
 
After I had dropped her off in her village before she got out of my car I said I had to tell her that I really liked her. She smiled and said thank you. She said she was a ‚Äúslow burner‚Äù and that she appreciated our friendship. She asked could we still be friends and I said of course, i wasn‚Äôt going to be offended by it or anything. 

I drove on home. Was fairly devastated the next day. Was beating myself up over fucking up the signals. But she was still continuing to send voice notes and texting throughout the week. 

We had a club dinner dance this weekend and I was sat beside her at the table. I chatted away as normal, just being myself the best I could. I was recounting a few stories and things and the few boys and herself were laughing away 

Anyhow about halfway through the night she disappeared for about 30/45 minutes and everyone was wondering where she was because we were getting club photos done or whatever. 

She came back and one of the older boys at the table asked where‚Äôd you go and she said she was just outside looking for another girl in the macra and then he said ‚Äúoh I thought you were out seeing Cian‚Äù (not real name). And what I find kind of heartbreaking for me about this is that when we were having coffee on the way home last week just by pure chance her phone rang on the table and it was Cian. So maybe I am overthinking things but I do think there is a man on the scene. 

I don‚Äôt care if someone is already seeing someone. More power to them. No issue there. But where I have an issue is trying make an effort and sure had I known the actual situation I would have been better off not. 

She is just such a lovely person. Honest to god. I just feel so comfortable with her. There‚Äôs a connection between the two of us there that I have never had with any other woman before. I can‚Äôt even describe it properly. But I really like her I suppose is the best thing to say. 

I felt I was putting in the effort and saying and doing the right things. But I dunno was it worth it at all. Maybe I rushed it. I felt that maybe I was letting things drag on then and I was right to say something. But it‚Äôs very hard to know. 

I don‚Äôt like being told that someone is a slow burner as regards seeing people and then possibly seeing someone else. You can‚Äôt play both sides of the field. That‚Äôs not fair. I don‚Äôt appreciate that at all. 

Living with the parents is bad enough at the moment and talking to her has been a good thing for me and I hope I have been doing the same for her. I just want to a solid person that can be there for someone.

But I am at a crossroads now. I was thinking of sticking with it as friends and seeing if maybe possibly things progress further. If they don‚Äôt then so be it. At least we had a go. 

Any thoughts or advice appreciated.

**A FEW QUICK NOTES**

I will be following along with the game and tagging winners in the comments of this post at the end of each quarter/game. As I'm running multiple boards, this will take a little time, so be patient! I'd rather be accurate than not. **It will be after the game when i start PMing winners to coordinate prizes. Please DO NOT reach out to me beforehand**. There is a system I need to follow to keep organized, and in every time I've run this, multiple users have won multiple prizes. I'd rather just PM **ONCE** to coordinate prizes. 

While I respect and expect y'all gonna be excited to win, and I want to ship all this out ASAP, there's a literal shitload of work for me to do and a potential logistical nightmare if the path gets strayed from.

On another note: I am feeling under the weather today. Hoping to get propped up by afternoon coffee and a sweet Eagles victory, but there may come a point tonight where I'll have to succumb to the Nyquil before all winners get PMed.  Just patience, all, please! 

That being said, thanks to all who have made this possible. Special thanks to /u/Teachmethings01, /u/HalfDeafYeller and /u/sadamallee who helped supply a lot of shiny and streamline entries. So far (knock on wood) this is the *smoothest* this has gone yet, and that's because of YOU, so thank YOU!

1ilgeg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/skilledtrades/comments/1ilgeg7/am_i_totally_fucking_wrong_here/,Am I totally fucking wrong here?,"I really need some advice to get my shit together. I am a 29 year old male living on the east coast. TL;DR at bottom

I have bounced around a lot in my career. Went to college, was in sales at small/mid tech companies for a while, did operations at a large communications company, and finally was a data analyst at an insurance company. Ended up at a back-breaking warehouse job to make ends meet when I couldn't find an office job with my skills and the money ran out. All these jobs were between 6 months and at most 1 year; I was never fired but I find it soul-crushing to work in an office environment. I'm not good at the politics, at small talk, at advocating for myself. Showing up at some cubicle everyday and dealing with the same mundane bullshit was really messing with my head. The only jobs I've managed to keep for close to or more than a year have been either fully remote or mostly remote, and even those I mostly tolerated because I needed the money. It was like, okay, I don't like this admin role where I'm basically filling out forms and checking boxes, but I'm making enough money, and I can go to the grocery store in the middle of the day, and save for a few meetings I'm mostly left alone. That was enough for me, but those jobs are hard to come by post-pandemic.

I went to grad school for a semester to pursue CS, but AI has pretty much wiped out all the entry level jobs and it was insanely expensive so I decided to leave. A large factor in deciding to leave was my therapist encouraging me to learn a trade and join a union. That maybe I wasn't cut out for office work to begin with, and that I would be happier/ able to hold something down if it was a more physically active job with less corporate speak. 

I dropped out in December, and since have been applying to unions, but it seems like my chances of getting in are slim and the process is very long. The IBEW in my area will take a year for me to even get tested, and best case scenario I'd start working in summer 2026. If I don't get in I will have to apply again and wait another year at least. The other trades I could see myself in have similar stories: I have been calling the carpenters union about my application from December but they ""do not offer timelines"", the pipefitters take applications for 2 weeks a year, and only up to 200 applicants. Of those 35-40 will get chosen. It could be years or simply never happen.

Trade school is in my purview but with the debt from grad school and the lower wages from switching to blue collar, it would put a big strain on my finances. Plus, the difference in union vs. non-union tradesmen in compensation so is so big it makes it WAY less worthwhile to be in the field if you're not in the union. The difference in lifetime earnings is in the millions of dollars. I have crunched the numbers.

The kicker is I was at my cousins place this weekend who's a former electrician and now in construction management. He wasn't discouraging, but he didn't exactly make it seem like it was a good idea. He kept telling me how difficult these jobs are, how much less I'll get paid, trying to convince me to do something in management with him - which is super nice, but I am try to get the fuck out of fluorescent lighting, gray walls, shit coffee, and Jim holding me hostage to talk about disc golf.

This all has me questioning what the fuck I'm doing. It was difficult to explain to my friends and parents that after another 10 years in some bullshit office making spreadsheets I would likely kill myself or buy a corvette and live out the rest of my days as a sex pest in Thailand. But when people in this line of work are telling me I'm crazy I'm starting to believe it. With the precariousness of getting into a union it has me thinking this may not be a wise decision.

Should I just nut up, lie on my resume a little like everyone else, get something where I can support myself and accept this is my life? I'm not void of skills but it's been extremely difficult for me to find jobs every time, and I don't even want them once I get them. But I'm at a loss here. I don't want to accept that most of my life will be spent crunching numbers behind a computer screen but I don't know if I can make something else work and I need to get by. It's embarrassing enough to be moving back into your parents house at 29, and I'm now in more debt than I've ever been. 

I can't keep jumping around. I have promised myself that the next thing I do I will stick to regardless of what it is. My friends are getting better jobs, getting promoted, traveling the world. I'm stuck at home. I don't want to be in this situation in five years because I didn't put the time in.

Thank you for any responses and I apologize for the word vomit.

TL;DR: College educated but hate office work/culture/everything. Trying to get blue collar job through union but is not easy and will likely be struggling financially if I go to trade school. Should I keep trying or 'grow up' and accept the office for what it is?",4,1739112863.0,skilledtrades,16,0.67,False
1ilgea6,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1ilgea6/i_think_im_gay/,I think I‚Äôm gay,"Idk if I‚Äôm actually gay or not cuz i still do got a lot of years ahead of me to figure that out but tbh i was never that attracted to women, yes i do find them beautiful and pretty but i was never attracted to them sexually, I always questioned it, my sexuality especially when I‚Äôm sitting with my friends (boys) and listen to how they talk about women, their girlfriends crushes etc, and I always find myself not having the same thoughts they share with the friend group, and tbh there‚Äôs this one guy i kinda like, i used to think that it‚Äôs just some friend crush and that i just find him cool but no, by the time went by I started growing actually feelings for him and not just sexual feelings.

So basically 2 years ago some new guy came to school, he was tall had black hair and had some cool style, and the school seatings are 2, 2 and 2 and I was on the back on the left side, my partner in class moved schools so I had to sit alone so when the new guy came the teacher let him sit next to me, I was a bit mad about it because I was enjoying my time alone but wtv, he sat next to me, as soon as he did he looked at me and introduced himself, I thought that was stupid cuz the teacher already made him do that in front of the whole class but I just played along, after some few classes with him I found him kinda nice and we had similar interests so it wasn‚Äôt awkward sitting next to each other, Im a person who struggles to make conversation and keep up with them but since we both liked a lot of the same things it wasn‚Äôt that hard talking to him, he was so nice to me he would always bring me chocolate milk in the morning after he found out that i liked it he was also very considerate of me being an introvert, he wouldn‚Äôt come to me and ask me to go to some parties with him or go to places that I have to make contacts with other people, he would just invite me to go to cinema‚Äôs and always chooses the movies that he knows that I would like, we would go to coffee shops together and do our homework‚Äôs go to parks and just sit there in silence which I loved very much, he would let me go to his house after school and we would play video games listen to music bake or do whatever, at some point of our relationship I didn‚Äôt mind what were we going to do together I only wanted to spend time with him and more the time passed by I got more greedy, I would want to stay with him all day, I would want to see him smiling at me I would only want him talk to me and only me which was weird really weird I never felt that way about anyone before so I didn‚Äôt know how should I act around him, whenever I find him talking to other people nicely I would think that the way he treated me wasn‚Äôt special and he treats everyone that way so I would find myself evading myself from him from time to time and at some point he noticed and confronted me.

 It was Friday and we just got out of school, he took me to the park nearby and kept asking me what‚Äôs wrong, I was so mad at myself at then so I started to cry, he hugged me and stopped asking me questions, he was just there petting my back and kept telling me to let it out which made me cry more, I was so mad at myself for ignoring him, for not explaining anything to him and his reaction, how he just comforted me silently and didn‚Äôt keep asking questions made me feel bad even more, how can he be so nice to me after me ignoring him for weeks, after few minutes of sobbing my eyes out I told him everything, it was so hard to sort my words out and try and make them sound reasonable and that my feelings are genuine, after talking to him for idk how long, and i was the only one who was talking the whole time he just looked down at me, his facial expression was so confusing to me I couldn‚Äôt know what was he thinking, he then said that it was all too much for him to sort it out and answer me at the moment because he is not gay and he also doesn‚Äôt know if he actually likes me or if it‚Äôs just some random teenager love feelings, so he asked me to give him some time to think and I told him he can answer me whenever he wants and that I can wait, I lied, I wanted him to give me an answer right there and then but ofc I couldn‚Äôt say that to him.

It‚Äôs been two weeks now and he still haven‚Äôt gave me an answer and Im starting to freak out, I should‚Äôve just kept my feelings to myself and enjoyed us as friends but no, i had to be greedy and wanting more, I‚Äôm seriously in pain rn, my heart can‚Äôt stop beating fast whenever I see him at school, him sitting next to me and acting casual, not like friends but classmates, and that actually genuinely broke me, I hope he gives me an answer fast or I would seriously just end up going back to him and cry all over again.",1,1739112851.0,lgbt,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1

The aging outpost

Janus fell. Weightless. Again. His sense of self, distant. Soundless, frigid. Reaching for something that was not there, hands finding no purchase. Falling still, a brilliant white crescent filled his field of vision, growing larger. A sudden onrush of energy relentlessly pounded him. *Please stop, no more!* A jolt.

The dream lingered ever so slightly, growing fainter, his eyes focused on his watch. ‚ÄùZero-six thirty-two. Bed, ceiling, body,"" he whispered the words. His place in space, re-established. No sweat this time. Good.

As he slowly woke, reality seeped into his eyes, and he could feel his muscles relax. It had been some time since his last nightmare. ""*Shit, Venn‚Äôs gonna have a field day with that one""* \- He thought as he calmed his breathing. Sitting up, squinting, he saw a sliver of golden sky on the horizon, painting the room in warm light, while shadows cast by small potted plants and a small bookshelf starkly contrasted the environment outside. Janus left his window uncovered, despite the occasional feeling of being watched at night. As his eyes adjusted some more, he turned his head to his right and noticed one red and one amber warning light above his bedroom door. ‚Äú*Shit,* *condition one* ***and*** *condition two? Better rise and shine‚Äù,* he thought.

He forcefully tapped his wristwatch three times as he groggily rose from his warm bed, feeling the cool air brush against his feet. His breathing slowed as he walked to his kitchen, sore muscles stiffening his movements. He settled onto the stool closest to the window and stretched, feeling his joints pop and crackle. The sleek espresso machine, triggered by the three taps, hissed, then hummed. The bitter aroma of coffee filled the crisp, unfiltered morning air. From his high vantage point, looking out over the vast snow plains of √Ügir, surrounded by stubby forests of pine-like trees casting long shadows across the snow, he could see the white-capped ocean, partially obscured by a large, snow-covered, jagged mountain. ‚ÄúGood morning Janus, did you sleep well?‚Äù a female voice emanating seemingly out of nowhere said.

""As if you don‚Äôt know already.‚Äù Janus‚Äôs lips curved into a smile, the words holding no edge. ‚ÄúAlso, Venn, what‚Äôs the weather like today?"" He said despite his innate understanding of this planet‚Äôs climate. ""Today‚Äôs a bit extra chilly, about negative thirty-one degrees celsius, with wind to boot, eighteen meters per second, gusting to twenty-three meters per second from the south."" Venn replied. ""Haha, that‚Äôs shrinkage cold!"" Janus exclaimed. ""I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not a sack of meat like you, dodged a bullet for sure! Also the replacement environment suit is still not finished so you can‚Äôt stay out for too long in just your backup gear, but there‚Äôs a calmer weather system developing, it will arrive by the evening."" Venn‚Äôs soft voice had some playfulness to it. ‚ÄúDamn it, Venn. What‚Äôs the holdup? Wait‚Äîbelay that. Coffee first."" Janus exclaimed as he felt a rush of anger, subsiding as quickly as it rose. ""Sure, Janus. You do know the 3D printer progress bar can be accessed from literally every screen, right? There‚Äôs nothing wrong with the printers."" Janus chuckled, gripping his cup a bit too tight, almost scalding his hand. ‚ÄúYeah, I know Venn, I‚Äôm a little on edge this morning, that‚Äôs all. The suit design was particularly intricate this time. Sorry‚Äù. ‚ÄúNo worries Janus, but you know we have to talk about your nightmare? You‚Äôre at a mental condition two fault state you know.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, but we can do that later, Venn, I‚Äôm not at condition one yet. And stop calling it ‚Äòfault state‚Äô, you‚Äôre the machine, not I!‚Äù Janus said dryly as the slight feeling of unease made a brief comeback as a pit in his stomach. ‚ÄúOof, that hurts right here, in my mechanical heart, you‚Äôre mean!‚Äù ‚ÄúAlways with the jokes!‚Äù He replied, throwing his hands in the air, the pit in his stomach less noticeable now.

Epsilon Eridani‚Äôs rays cast a strikingly golden hue onto the swirling steam of the cup of coffee, as a fierce gust of wind whipped up a fresh drift of snow, dimming the deceptively warm light for a fleeting moment.

‚ÄúAny messages from home yet?‚Äù Janus said looking out over the desolate¬† ‚ÄúNo, Janus, it‚Äôs been very quiet. I queried all the relay stations at regular intervals as soon as we faced them.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ this is nominal, for now.‚Äù His brows furrowed, lips turned down almost imperceptibly.¬†

As Janus inhaled the exquisite aroma of the carefully crafted cup of coffee, he contemplated today‚Äôs agenda; The rover had broken down, making long excursions impossible, and the 3D printer was occupied due to a major overhaul of the environment suit, so the production of spare parts had been delayed even more. The manifest of today‚Äôs resupply drop was vague and probably falsified, so he could not count on that they had sent the correct parts. The new warning lights were just another brick in the wall, he thought. His jaw muscles tightened as he adjusted his position on the stool, thinking of the anomalous sensor readings from Outpost eleven. No matter, he was stuck at the outpost for now. Peering out the window and yawning, he remembered the days he enjoyed feeling the raw power of the wind, the way it made him feel fragile yet in control. He hoped he could revisit that part of himself today.

After finishing his prescribed breakfast‚ÄîVenn insisted on calling it that‚ÄîJanus moved to the wardrobe as the lights adjusted to his presence. As he put on his woollen mesh undergarments, he longed for the sweet, short summer months of mild temperatures, long days, and the way that they made everything easier. Shivering in anticipation of the coming cold, he spoke to Venn;‚ÄúRemind me, what‚Äôs on today‚Äôs agenda? I saw the warning lights.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve thought some more about our discussion about the water filters last night and they definitely need cleaning. Our observation report on the star‚Äôs fluctuating brightness pattern is due in two days, so you‚Äôll need to review that, and believe it or not, some bolts on the communications mast need to be torqued to spec!‚Äù Venn‚Äôs voice had a slight amused tone to it. ‚ÄúJust as I feared, and the bolts being loose is weird. Also the star has been unusually quiet this report cycle.‚Äù He muttered absent mindedly as he could feel his gut tighten.After donning the rest of his backup cold weather gear, being careful to cover any exposed skin, he contemplated the cause of these anomalies‚Äîthere had been a few lately‚Äî as he walked through the ‚Äòairlock.‚Äô¬†

This wasn‚Äôt a true vacuum-sealed chamber, but rather an architectural design choice to conserve energy and protect the indoor environment by limiting the intrusion of the harsh exterior elements. As the interior door closed shut with a soft thud, lights flickering, he began to hum‚Äîthe same melody as always. It was a habit now, the tune lasting just long enough to fill the pause before the outer door unlocked and opened. Glancing up at the flickering light, the pit in his stomach returned briefly. ‚ÄúYep, it‚Äôs one of **those** days‚Ä¶‚Äù Janus muttered as snow started filling the air in the room he was standing. He stepped outside to a familiar, yet alien world. Hanging low above the horizon, Epsilon Eridani‚Äôs rays waded through √Ügir‚Äôs air. The impatient blues and violets, so easily swayed, left only the orange and golds to paint the landscape. The wind snagged his jacket, exposing the breathable layers beneath. A momentary lapse in breathing resulted as the icy air sapped heat away. He had forgotten to tighten his jacket. As he did, the vast valley plains, crowned by forests and mountains in the distance, had him staring. During a slight lull in wind, he inhaled the pristine air. ‚ÄúI never get tired of that view, Venn‚Äù, he whispered to his only companion in the entire world. As he leaned against the wind, Venn answered in his helmet headset ‚ÄúIt really is something isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù ‚ÄúMhm, we‚Äôre the only ones able to appreciate this‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhat is the size and torque specs for the bolts?‚Äù He said as he approached the outside tool storage unit. ‚Äú**Thirty millimeters, two thousand-four hundred and twenty two Newton meters**. There‚Äôs twelve of them.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat!? The main bolts are loose?! Why didn‚Äôt you tell me earlier, especially with this wind?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Janus, but there are one hundred and twenty eight in total. Nine point three seven five percent of the bolts are loose, which is below the threshold of ten percent for a condition one fault, so I saw no need to rush you.‚Äù ‚ÄúVenn, that‚Äôs a condition one waiting to happen.‚Äù Slightly frustrated¬† by Venn's behaviour and himself for his lapse in curiosity, he grabbed the bulky hydraulic torque multiplier backpack from the outside storage unit. The tool had a worn, rugged and well-thought out appearance, with a compact display for showing diagnostics to the operator. He made his way towards the communications tower on the hard, wind-sculpted sastrugi-covered snow field. Every step emitting a loud hollow creaking noise, punctuating the frigid conditions. He chose to walk the small hill to stave off the cold despite the near condition one fault. As he approached the base of the tower, his breathing was heavy, misting in the frigid air. Craning his neck, he looked up at the structure, a starkly white construction mixing with the light blue sky. Despite being careful not to sweat, he could feel perspiration starting to manifest, a deadly sin in these conditions. His goggles indicated where the loose bolts were located. Buffeted by the wind, feeling its pressure against his back, he worked efficiently, dismounting the torque wrench and preparing it for use. The melodic howling of the wind across the communications mast had a calming effect on Janus. ‚Äú*They really have thought of everything, too bad nothing lasts forever.‚Äù* he thought as he applied the tool to the first bolt, quickly drowning out all other noise with rapid clacking.Drawing laboured breaths, Janus methodically took to the task at hand, double checking and documenting each bolt with the wrench‚Äôs user interface, before moving onto the next. Despite the meditative qualities of this work, he was unable to control his thoughts sufficiently to hold back the gnawing feeling of wrongness of these anomalies, leaving him distracted.‚ÄúVenn, are there any more bolts that indicate that they might come loose?‚Äù ‚ÄúActually there are,‚Äù Venn replied as four new icons faded into view. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not very loose, but I see why you might want to remedy that since you‚Äôre already up here.‚Äù ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù Janus shouted as a powerful gust of wind nearly knocked him over and brought a fresh blast of drift snow up, making him grab for handholds. ‚ÄúWhen did you first notice the bolts coming loose? How did it progress?‚Äù Janus asked loudly over the flapping of his garments.. ‚ÄúFirst indication of loosening was zero four twenty one this night, all bolts became loose at the same time, the four bolts you‚Äôre tightening now have been loose since last friday, but they only reduced their clamping force by five percent.‚Äù Rubbing his shoulders and taking a deep breath he replied ‚ÄúOkay. Simultaneous loosening of twelve bolts?¬† That‚Äôs probably the wind, right?‚Äù Venn replied as he shifted to the next bolt. ‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs my assessment as well, it coincides with a strong wind gust, and after some modelling and looking at the slight stretch of the bolts, it basically confirms that it was the wind.‚Äù ‚ÄúHaha, just the wind, and long bolts that will need replacing.‚Äù Janus laughed without any humor as he shivered.

Static work, exposed to those conditions, was far from comfortable. Shivering, he did a quick brush off on any loose snow that had settled onto the wrench and packed it up into its carrying backpack. Being careful to not trip, he rushed down the small hill, rhythmic, hollow creaking accompanying his every footfall. ‚Äú*Hot damn, that environmental suit cannot be finished quickly enough.‚Äù* ¬†he thought as his brain was jostled by the sharp impacts on the hard snow.Halfway down the hill, warmth seeped back into his fingertips and toes‚Äîa welcome but brief relief, as running downhill didn‚Äôt produce nearly as much heat as walking uphill.

The jostling weight of the equipment pack pressed against his lower back, each sharp impact rippling tension through his body. Looking far ahead, his breath hitched. Fingers clenched around the straps, his vision narrowed and the hollow feeling was creeping in again‚Äîfamiliar, unwelcome. He slowed his pace and started to deliberately draw deep breaths in an effort to stave off whatever might come of this.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs happening again, Venn.‚Äù ‚ÄúI can see that.‚Äù Venn replied. ‚ÄúGood, keep doing that, deep breaths, just like we practiced‚Ä¶ I have a bit of good news! The resupply drop is on schedule, I‚Äôm expecting it to enter the atmosphere around nineteen thirty this evening, and Outpost eleven has started reporting normal readings intermittently.‚Äù ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù he¬†

replied tersely.¬†

Feeling for the sensation of his body, the position of his limbs, the coldness of his toes, Janus managed to settle his churning mind. He resumed his downhill trek at a slower pace. As the habitat came into view again, the observation dome on the roof gleaming in the star light,¬† he had completely regained his faculties but the feeling of walking at the edge was still very much present *‚ÄúFuck, this is getting ridiculus.*‚Äù He thought. ‚ÄúVenn, about the nightmares, I think we need to treat me as having a condition one fault!‚Äù He almost yelled due to the powerful wind flapping his garments. ‚ÄúWell no shit - ehm I mean good! How about we talk at dinner?‚Äù Venn replied with a large dose of humour. Janus felt his mood lighten significantly at the unexpected retort, his shoulders relaxing. ‚ÄúYeah, sure, it isn‚Äôt exactly like I‚Äôm having a date.‚Äù Walking up the windswept ramp to the storage unit, he had to fight the wind as he gritted his teeth. Opening the heavy door, the years of hydraulic oil, solvents and heavy industry so different to pristine outside air came rushing at him. Walking up to the exterior door he looked up at the inconspicuous and faded text to the left of the door, ‚ÄòOutpost 8‚Äô. He entered the airlock, the outer door making a satisfying thud-click sound as it closed. As it did, his world plunged into darkness.",6,1739112805.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
1ilgcgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ilgcgk/large_capacity_electric_kettle/,Large capacity electric kettle,"Hi.  I just ordered an Etkin pour over set with carafe, with a stated capacity of 8 cups.  I think it‚Äôs probably a bit less than that as the website also states that it holds 1.5 liters, which is a bit more than 6 cups if I did my math right. 

Anyway, I‚Äôve never done pour over coffee before, and need a kettle.  I think I‚Äôd like an electric, but don‚Äôt know enough about it to have a fixed opinion.  I think it would heat up faster?  Have better control over temperature?  The thing is, I don‚Äôt want to spend too much as I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll like it or not, so I‚Äôm thinking under $80 or so?  Or maybe a stove top kettle is good enough, some of them have thermometers. 

Also, they don‚Äôt seem to have enough capacity to effectively make use of the ‚Äú8 cup‚Äù carafe.  I would expect that we would want to make at least 3 or 4 cups on a regular basis, and possibly more when we have guests.  
Suggestions welcome on what would work best for my usage.

This heating pad boasts a size of 12""x24"", which is ideal for covering larger areas such as the back, shoulders, or legs. Its ultra-soft microplush material felt luxurious against my skin, and I didn‚Äôt need an additional cover to enhance comfort. The adjustable heat settings, ranging from low to high, made it easy for me to customize the warmth based on what I needed. Personally, I found the medium setting to be just right for soothing my sore back after a long day. However, the high setting, while warm, didn‚Äôt get as hot as I had hoped, which might disappoint users who prefer intense heat therapy.

One of the standout features is the auto shut-off function, which gives peace of mind. I‚Äôm the kind of person who tends to fall asleep while using heating pads, so knowing that this one would turn off automatically was a huge plus. The 7-foot cord allowed me to move around without being tethered too close to an outlet, making it more versatile for use in different rooms.

The timer options, ranging from 30 to 120 minutes, were another thoughtful addition. I tried every option during my test period and appreciated the flexibility it offered. Whether I wanted a quick muscle relaxation session or extended warmth while watching TV, this heating pad adapted easily. The machine-washable feature was another convenience I didn‚Äôt realize I needed until the first accidental coffee spill. Tossing it in the washer made maintenance a breeze.

That said, there are a few areas where the product could improve. While the large size is marketed as ""XL,"" it didn‚Äôt feel significantly bigger than other standard heating pads I‚Äôve used. Additionally, some users might find the heat output underwhelming, especially on colder days when stronger warmth is desired. I also noticed that the heating pad tends to cool down slightly after prolonged use, which could be a dealbreaker for people seeking consistent high heat.

**Pros**

* Ultra-soft and comfortable microplush material.
* Large surface area, great for covering multiple body parts.
* Adjustable heat settings with a safe auto shut-off feature.
* Machine washable for easy cleaning.
* Long cord for added mobility.

**Cons**

* Doesn‚Äôt get as hot as some users might prefer.
* Heat consistency can waver during extended use.
* ""XL"" size may not meet expectations for all users.
* No manual timer for customized shut-off intervals.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to other heating pads I‚Äôve tried, the GENIANI model stands out for its plush fabric and thoughtful safety features, like auto shut-off and timer settings. When placed side by side with the Sunbeam XL heating pad, for example, the GENIANI pad wins in terms of comfort and fabric quality. However, the Sunbeam model offers a slightly higher heat level, which might appeal to users who prioritize intense warmth. Another contender, the Pure Enrichment heating pad, offers similar features but tends to be pricier, making the GENIANI a more budget-friendly option for those not needing extreme heat.

On the durability front, I‚Äôve read mixed reviews about GENIANI‚Äôs heating pad lasting over a year, but so far, mine shows no signs of wear. Compared to cheaper alternatives that often break within a few months, this pad feels more reliable, albeit not entirely perfect.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
While the GENIANI heating pad isn‚Äôt the cheapest option on the market, it strikes a good balance between affordability and quality. Its features‚Äîauto shut-off, soft fabric, and adjustable heat‚Äîjustify the slightly higher price point compared to basic models. If you‚Äôre someone who uses heating pads frequently, the value becomes even clearer. However, if you‚Äôre seeking industrial-strength heat or ultra-durable construction, you might consider investing in a pricier alternative.

Glug of cold brew coffee,

They have a routine, every Sunday before we wake up, they hit the gym and have breakfast together. Since they work in the same industry, they attend conferences together and sometimes grab lunch or coffee on weekdays. 

They also have after-work drinks, maybe once a month. 

His friend was there for him during tough times, and I‚Äôm happy he has that support. 

But I feel like their closeness is starting to affect our relationship.

The tipping point: our recent family trip with his friend‚Äôs family. I thought it would be a nice experience, but I started feeling like we were just accessories, if the trip was more about him spending time with his friend than us.

One night, after the kids went to bed, he asked if he could go out for drinks with his friend. I said yes, thinking he‚Äôd be back in an hour, but he was gone for four hours. 

When he got back, I told him he should cool down on this bromance and stop seeing his friend so frequently because it felt excessive; they already see each other outside of this holiday.

So the story is about me, a close friend of mine (let's name her Mimi) and a colleague Ava.  
Mimi and I have known each other since primary school, but our friendship got stronger the last 7 years. We've had a very loyal and strong friendship and could rely on each other on anything. Mimi has always been private about her job, she never liked talking about it, never mentioned her colleagues, and ive respected that, never questioned it. There have also been some bad gossips going around for years about Mimi regarding her job, and because i dont believe in gossips since they're not always true, I have always ignored it and never mentioned to Mimi. I knew someone tried to harm Mimis reputation and it was all a lie. For all those years I ignored the gossip and always tried to shut it down whenever someone tried to bring it up. I also come from a place where gossip is very much a ""sport"" and people use it to harm others, they also believe it very easily.

The problem starts when I meet Ava, a colleague from work, same age as me and we hit it off. At first she seems friendly and fun. We start hanging out a lot for months and seem to have a lot in common. She rely's on me on advice and opens up a lot to me, especially about her problematic marriage ( which she apparently doesnt really care about and uses as a victim card to gain peoples trust). Later on, I find out Ava used to work with Mimi in the same institution and it baffles me how Mimi never mentioned it. Anyway, one time as Ava and I went out for drinks, she indirectly mentions something about Mimi (she plays me and I fell for it). I knew at that time that anyone that ever put foot on the institution where Mimi worked, would know about the gossip. So I mention it to Ava and tell her that I know my friend too well to know that it's all a stupid gossip. So the problem here is I mentiong it! ME!!!

Later on, I meet Mimi for coffee and mention Ava to her and ask her why she never mention her. Mimi becomes defensive, tells me to distance myself from Ava and starts telling me the worst things about her. Which she spread around as if I have said those things about Ava(and I havent). It turns out Mimi and Ava have been life long enemies and have been using my name to get to each other. Ava was never my friend and Mimi... well I dont know!  
I was shocked!!! I felt betrayed, used and exposed. I am losing sleep over this. I have distanced myself from both of them and dont know how to fix this.

Despite all this, I also feel immense guilt that I ever said anything to Ava regarding the gossip about Mimi.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ilfw6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoverPetSitting/comments/1ilfw6t/how_to_increase_bookings/,How to increase bookings,"Hi! I have been a rover sitter for 8 months now, and loving it! December was almost $4k after rover fees, and I average about $2k-$3k / month outside of the holidays

I could take on a lot more, but we travel a lot so I only have about 2-3 weeks per month to Rover, but the point being, you could do much better than me!

I own a couple small businesses in my state that run on their own, so I love spending my free time hanging out with my dogs and my rover clients. Best side hustle ever.

I‚Äôve seen a lot of people post about things slowing down, so I wanted to share some ways to boost clients:

Option 1: Using staples templates or Canva if you feel more creative, create business cards! You can make a cute name for yourself, or just do something simple like: (Your name)‚Äôs Pet Care
Your phone number 
A link to your rover profile OR you can enter the URL into a QR code generator (available both on staples and canva)

Or flyers (can be printed at staples)

Having a really good client testimonial on your business card or flyer can really help, as this is a trust based industry 

Bring these to local pet stores, groomers, coffee shops, vets offices, etc. You can call most places and ask first if they have an area for you to leave business cards or flyers! This is so great for getting your name out. Bonus points if you feel confident enough to introduce yourself to some people while you‚Äôre there putting them out! 

Option 2: Reach out to your clients that had a good experience with you, let them know you are looking to grow the business and ask if they could possibly share you information with family or friends. Word of mouth results in more conversations to sales, as people trust the advice of friends / family so much! 


Another thing that really helps: Perfect your service and customer experience!

I need some advice. I just started brewing coffee and i'm trying to figure out what tastes off about the coffee i'm making.

Coffee i'm using - Pre-Ground medium roast arabica manufactured in dec 2024(got it from a cafe near my home. not speciality)

Device - aeropress. i don't have a thermometer for water temp. so i'm guessing based on bubbles in the kettle

What seems wrong :
**1st try** - 16g coffee to 150 ml water. 45 second bloom, 2 min immersion and 30 second plunge. water about 85-90 degree 
- the coffee tasted bitter. added 100ml milk still kinda bitter. added 1 spoon sugar and that made the taste a bit better

**2nd try** - same recipie but used water at 80-85 degrees and 4 min immersion. added 100 ml water afterwards
- coffee tasted very weird. kind of sour and bitter at the same time. less bitter than the first time though (according to my immature taste buds)

**3rd try** - same recipie with water just off the boil and same time as 1st try
- The bitterness was much less. but the coffee tasted kind of flat. mixed with 100 ml milk and still flat. i got a better coffee taste 1st try inspite of bitterness.

So i'm kinda confused what's going on. was the temp. alright as no bitterness? did the hot temp of water burn away the coffee taste?

1ilftoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/tonsilstones/comments/1ilftoz/never_had_tonsil_stones_before/,Never had tonsil stones before‚Ä¶,"Last Saturday, I noticed that my throat felt irritated with post-nasal drip and figured I was coming down with something. I was just looking around my mouth to see if it seemed irritated and I noticed two tonsil stones. I did a little research, gargled with salt water, and poked them out. After which I gargled with a water/hydrogen peroxide mixture. 
Meanwhile, I treated the post nasal drip like I do when I think I'm coming down with a cold and I thought it cleared up.
A week later, I noticed the same feeling and saw another tonsil stone in the same area. This one seems a little deeper in so I think I'll see if it comes to the surface more.

I've never had tonsil stones before in my 22 years, or at least that I've ever noticed. When I was little, the dentist said my tonsils were large but I think I grew into them? I'm mostly gluten free already which I've seen some people say has helped them, and I've been trying to drink less coffee for other health reasons.

I do oil pull in the mornings for cavity prevention but I had been slacking on it when I noticed the first stones. I'm going to get some of those curved syringes that I've seen people mention on here as well.

I moved to a new apartment in the fall and this winter has been super dry (I also have electric baseboard heat) so I got a humidifier to help but I'm not sure if that has any connection. I'm already on a D3 supplement as well.

Any other tips or thoughts for why this could be happening??",1,1739111194.0,tonsilstones,1,1.0,False

I take magnesium, potassium, omega 3, vitamin D.

1ilfryv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anemic/comments/1ilfryv/28_year_old_male_low_iron_only/,"28 year old male, low iron only","Hello,
Up to around two years ago (starting around a decade before that) I've just about consistently had high iron levels, so much so that I used to donate blood twice a year to keep it in check.
I then started getting migraines, whose cause was never diagnosed but are well-managed via managing stress, and stopped donating blood by recommendation of my GP.
In the intervening time period, my blood iron levels started stabilizing finally, and generally all my bloodwork would come out fine (except the occasional spike in eosinophil %, allergy-related, since forever).  
About half a year ago, I changed my GP, and he ran a full blood panel, everything seemed as usual except for slightly low Iron (60micg/dl, just shy under the minimum of 65).
Didn't give it much thought and chucked it up to bad eating habits over exams (I have ADHD and both the meds I was taking at the time and hyperfocus can make me forget to eat).
Few months later I did another routine test as my GP wanted to check up on the iron levels, everything seemed to be moving in the right direction again. Ferreting and transferrin (absolute and saturation) went up.  
Which gets me to now, deciding to go back to swimming as my new year's resolution, I was surprised that not much happened to my migraines, and in fact I only had 4 episodes since June 2024 - all of them were quite light and only one required any use of NSAIDs (a single 200mg Advil pill).
But now, I noticed that once I tried to up the difficulty in swimming, I was even getting light-headed just when changing posture from swimming to standing in the pool - a few times I even fell over after getting out of the pool.  
I went in for another blood test, this time transferrin still went up some more (now sitting at 236mg/dl), ferretin too (now 70ng/ml), except for slightly high eosinophil percentage and slightly low neutrophil percentage (tad about the max tad below the min, respectively) all the section related to blood cells is fine and generally the values fall right in the middle of their respective ranges (and have been like that for years going to older tests).
Only other outliers are low Iron (which now has slipped to 43 micg/dl) and severe vitamin D deficiency (8ng/ml).  

When I went in to the GP to get his opinion, he was sick that day and had a different doctor instead, whom didn't seem to care much about the results as I stated other than the cold limbs and postural dizziness I don't feel much - and these are symptoms I've always dealt with so it isn't a big deal (mildly slow vasovagal response, and low resti g heart-rate. Checked in the past, conclusion was it being genetic and no need for medical intervention other than minor lifestyle adjustments).
I did get referred to a gastroentreologist and a neurologist ""at your own discretion"" is what the doctor told me (presumably seeing from my symptoms nothing to be serious).  

I am going to see the gastroentreologist by tbe end of this month, and I'm not too worried about the neurologist as not long ago I switched up my ADHD meds from Attent/Adderall to Vyvanse precisely because the latter should be less appetite-suppressing and less likely to trigger migraines (so far, so good actually).
Is there anything else I might be missing?  
Nutrition-wise I'm basically an omnivoire with strong preference for leafy greens with most meals (in addition to the meat), and I generally avoid (though still sometimes eat) eggs and dairy - the former because I dislike the smell, the latter because too much will cause indigestion.
One confounding factor I'm aware of is drinking lots of coffee and tea, many times it is how I avoid taking my ADHD meds daily (bit of caffeine and CBT works nicely).
But even then, since the past summer I've heavily cut down my coffee and tea consumption.
Mind you, by now even though I've stopped doing sports altogether, the symptoms are only getting worse: light long-lasting headaches (which I don't medicate), lethargy, light-headedness, tiredness, sleeping too much (went from 6.5-7 to 8+).  

Honestly I'm a bit on wits end here, sort of hoping the gastroentreologist will tell my its H.Pylori again, but I'm expecting most likely not - non of the symptoms are present like last time (14-ish years ago).
In general what tests should I be asking for? For example, vitamin D was extremely surprising, I generally go outside enough to never ever have needed supplementing (sun will burn you easily here too, its the Levant).",2,1739111052.0,Anemic,1,1.0,False

In my opinion, AI winners are not going to be huge know-it-all LLMs running on expensive chip farms, but small fast and cheap devices and programs which will be deployed on massive scales and will learn and perform on demand, cheap, fast, and better than clunky LLMs.  The era of Open AI-style boil-the-ocean LLMs is over because these models are expensive, slow to train and learn, and they are often wrong, hallucinate, and do not pay attention to detail, whereas these products/services are the opposite - cheap, fast and better for the intended/specialized use. These picks have a large potential in my opinion, and are the next wave of AI commercialization and deployment.

How is this fair?,"It‚Äôs simply not fair. In every story you hear the one who gets cheated on gets better, makes more, improves and always makes the cheater jealous. So why is my situation so awful?

I met my boyfriend, ‚ÄúElliot‚Äù in the 8th grade. We were good friends for a year before we started dating in the 9th, and continued all throughout highschool and two years of college. He was perfect, honestly amazing. All he would do all day is spend time with me, and when he was with his friends he‚Äôd talk about how amazing our relationship was.

He was tall, and really good-looking, so I felt so special that he loved me. We were in love, meeting everyday, we were eachother first everything and had even begun discussing marriage by our 5th year of dating.

Elliot had honestly never given me a reason to even worry about him cheating ‚Äî until he did.

The night before one of my most important final exams he came over sobbing, and confessed how the night before he got far too drunk and woke up naked in the bed of a random girl. 

I was wrecked. I knew I had to break up with him for this betrayal, so I did. He kept trying ‚Äî flowers, letters everyday. He began sending me money (he knew I had some financial problems) and wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone, begging me to reconsider.

But a cheater is a cheater.

I stayed in bed crying for weeks, bombed my final so badly it almost affected my educational status. To this day (it‚Äôs been 3 years since him and I last spoke) anytime I see flowers, or a rom-com, I get a little hurt each time.

I tried to go out with men, to move on, but I ended up looking for him in everyone. 

My life went downhill after I found out. I was scoring pretty high in all my classes, after I found out though, I dropped multiple grades so I was just passing. 

I quit my job because I never had the energy to get up in the morning. I cut off all my friends because we made them together and their faces made me feel worse.

I barely graduated and moved back home with my parents still grieving.

The one thing I stuck to was keeping no contact. I deleted all his pictures, blocked and deleted his contact, and deleted all my social media.

A few months ago, I had begun feeling better. Waking up every morning didn‚Äôt hurt so much. I got a job waitressing and made some new friends. I even started up my old small business that I quit because everything was too much effort. I had begun earning good money.

Last week, I met up with an old school friend of mine. She messaged me and asked to meet up for coffee. Amid coffee she brought up Elliot.

She asked how I felt about his career now. And I asked what she meant. She told me to forget it, and said nevermind.

He was stuck on my mind since then, so I went home and searched him up.

His business had taken off and he had multiple articles written about him. His salary had grown to 7 figures and he had a gorgeous, tiny girl on his arm.

HOW IS THIS FAIR?? IM THE ONE WHO SUFFERED! HE CHEATED. WHY IS HE WINNING.

I‚Äôve been in bed rotting. I don‚Äôt want to annoy anyone else so I‚Äôm writing on here.

Review:
Right off the bat, this stuff smells incredible. The first whiff totally reminded me of Sauvage Elixir. When you first spray it, you get this burnt coffee and pepper vibe, but that intense kick fades after a couple of minutes, revealing a scent that's super close to Sauvage Elixir. In the air, it‚Äôs pretty much identical. After about an hour, though, it shifts gears with more vanilla and wood notes, dialing back the spices. The drydown isn‚Äôt as similar to Sauvage Elixir, but it‚Äôs still really nice.   A lot of people might even say it smells better. As for how it performs on me, it‚Äôs been just okay so far. I‚Äôll give it another month to see if it gets better. I‚Äôm getting around 4 hours on my skin with a low to medium projection. I‚Äôll update my review later, and if the performance improves, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs definitely worth it. Overall, it smells fantastic and is a solid clone of Sauvage Elixir, just with a little twist in the drydown.

The first thing that struck me was its design. The silver metallic finish has a modern vibe that complements my kitchen decor. It‚Äôs compact enough to fit snugly on my counter without hogging space, which matters when your kitchen feels smaller than your coffee cravings. The build itself feels sturdy, though I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôve been cautious after reading about wear-and-tear issues from other buyers. That said, the 78 oz removable reservoir is a game-changer for me. No more frequent refills, and the handle on the tank makes it super easy to carry to the sink.

On to the brewing performance, which is where things get interesting. Keurig‚Äôs MultiStream Technology promises better extraction of flavor and aroma by using five water streams. I‚Äôve noticed the coffee does taste more robust compared to older Keurig models I‚Äôve tried at friends‚Äô homes. It brews quickly too‚Äîperfect for those mornings when my toddler decides to wake up extra early and turn the kitchen into his personal jungle gym. However, I did notice some inconsistency in the brewing process. Occasionally, the amount of coffee dispensed would be slightly off. It doesn‚Äôt happen often, but when it does, it‚Äôs frustrating.

When it comes to coffee flavor, though, this machine shines. I‚Äôm a fan of bold, strong brews, and the programmable settings let me customize the strength and temperature to my liking. My partner, on the other hand, prefers a milder cup, so the three favorite presets have been a lifesaver for avoiding morning bickering. I‚Äôve even used the ‚ÄúOver Ice‚Äù feature for iced coffee on hotter days, and it works surprisingly well without diluting the flavor.

Cleaning and maintenance? Mixed feelings here. While the parts are easy to disassemble and rinse, the machine does require regular descaling, which can be a bit of a chore. After the first descaling cycle, everything worked fine, but the second one caused some temporary performance issues. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but it‚Äôs something to keep in mind if you‚Äôre not a fan of routine upkeep.

**Pros:**

* Compact design with a modern, metallic finish that looks great in any kitchen.
* 78 oz removable reservoir reduces the hassle of constant refilling.
* MultiStream Technology enhances the flavor and aroma of your coffee.
* Programmable settings for strength, temperature, and size customization.
* Quieter operation compared to older Keurig models.

**Cons:**

* Occasional inconsistency in brewing amount.
* Requires regular descaling, which can sometimes disrupt performance.
* Mug platform may feel undersized for larger cups or travel mugs.
* Some reports of durability issues from long-term users.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to Nespresso‚Äôs Vertuo line, the Keurig K-Supreme Plus offers more flexibility with brew sizes and strength adjustments. However, Nespresso machines are often praised for their richer crema and more luxurious taste, especially for espresso lovers. On the flip side, Keurig‚Äôs reusable My K-Cup filter gives it an edge for eco-conscious users or those who prefer using their own coffee grounds.

The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew is another competitor worth mentioning. While it‚Äôs more affordable and offers dual brewing options (single-serve and full pot), it lacks the advanced features and sleek design of the K-Supreme Plus. Additionally, the brewing speed and flavor extraction on the Keurig are noticeably superior.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

The K-Supreme Plus sits in the mid-to-high price range for single-serve coffee makers. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest option, the customization features, MultiStream Technology, and large water reservoir make it a solid investment for coffee enthusiasts. If you‚Äôre the type who values convenience and enjoys experimenting with different coffee strengths and styles, this machine is worth considering.

Features like the programmable presets and ‚ÄúOver Ice‚Äù option add to its versatility, making it a great choice for households with varied coffee preferences. However, if you‚Äôre someone who prioritizes durability above all else, you might want to weigh the mixed reviews on its longevity before making a decision.

She always does that. I‚Äôve never heard her extend a sincere apology to anyone on this show.

Tisha was right from the very beginning about Mel and hopefully people finally see it. She does not know how to be a real friend.

People really need to go back and watch the show from the beginning. Mel criticized Tisha for calling her too much to check on her as it was a ""reminder"" of what she was going through with Martell. Yet, she laughed in Tisha's face during the episode at the coffee shop saying ""My real friends took me out to dinner and got me out the house."" Tisha was so confused because she tried to do the same for Mel and she refused.

Now, she's doing the exact thing to Nell. It's one thing to be mad with Chris, but what did Nell do to you? I don't want to hear no more about what Mel went through in her marriage for sympathy. ""I was abused"" but you are also emotionally abusive toward your friends.

These Melometers claim Melody is being bullied but I have yet to see that. All I see is her being the bully.

Mel is not pro-woman at all like her new BFF Sunni. And how is Carlos going to tell Destiny she was too harsh on Sunni? Destiny had the same energy for Moses when they met up that she had for Sunni. I want to see Destiny finally find some self-worth and get her ish together. At 40-something years old, you're frolicking around with a 33 year old while facing jail time....girl, focus on your damn son.

Glad Melody is gone. She's so disengaged and Carlos was pandering by not confronting her about her attitude and behavior during the season. It's annoying. Only Kimmi and Destiny showed some heart .


I don't know what it is about Tricia, but she‚Äôs just not it. She didn‚Äôt need to come back next season. Seems deceitful and manipulative. It was very disrespectful of her to have laughed when Ken said ""our kids"" at the graduation party. Marquez is a weird idiot, but she had two kids by him and he is, in fact, their father, not Ken! It wasn't necessary for Ken to throw shade like that and her to laugh about it. Tricia is just as immature as her husband (ex-husband now?).  I'm not interested in her, her family, business etc. nor Ken and Marquez, they all need to go. However, Ken is chasing fame and Marquez seems thirsty for camera time, too.

I'm cross training next week so I ended up with Friday, Saturday and Sunday off this week. I was SO excited to have all this time off to chill and recharge. 

I apparently thought this too loud or something because it's Sunday now and I haven't relaxed at all. 

Husband is STILL sick AF. He took Friday off work entirely, flipped the couch around so it faced the wall and the back of the couch faced out into the livingroom to keep the baby from climbing on him and didn't move all day. 

He did make sure I got to the karaoke event I was planning to go to after my ride flaked 10 minutes before we were set to go so I'll give him that. 

Funny note: his sister was supposed to babysit so we could both go to karaoke but he was too sick. Being sick AF, he was going out of his way to make sure the toddler didn't touch him at all because germs. So this guy asked his sister if she'd still be willing to come over and watch the baby until she went to bed so he wouldn't have to touch/handle her at all. She did not lol 

It took him until nearly midnight to get our toddler down but that didn't surprise me lol he gives up VERY easily if she doesn't go down and just let's her go back to playing. 

Saturday he decided that he'd turn the couch back the normal way. Continued to lay on it, unmoving the entire day. Calling out ""Baaabbeee?! I'm sick!"" Every time the toddler got close to him. He did go out after lunch and wash/dry laundry. A load of which needed a second round because a rogue diaper some how got into the basket and went unnoticed.

So Friday and Saturday I got absolutely nothing done. I was chasing the toddler away from him ever 2 seconds basically all day, while still trying to cook and clean as I went. 

Today (thankfully) he's back at work until 4ish. But now the apartment is absolute disaster and I have roughly a million things to do.

All I wanted to do this weekend was relax, recharge and play stardew valley on the nintendo switch. That's it. That was my big plans for the weekend and I've played maybe an hour this entire time? 

Driving me crazy. I don't even get to rest/relax like that when I'm sick. Like last time I was sick, I felt like shit, could hardly move from the body aches and all but lost my voice. You know what I did? I went to work all week, I still cooked suppers, did dishes and handled all of baby's night time routine/bed time and night wakes. 

There was no laying on the couch on the days at a time, demanding I not be touched and also demanding I get waited on hand and foot because ""I'm So SiCk üò´""
