Respond below with:

* what you want limited to the [100 point bracket](https://www.starbucks.ca/rewards). Feel free to get clever with tips from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/search/?q=100+stars). (At least one person get a bakery thing please, I need it to unlock some more stars.) 

> 100 stars: Get a brewed coffee, bakery item, packaged snack, or other lower-tier reward 

* the closest Starbucks location to you that can do mobile orders
* Be ready to pick up immediately, the order will be under ""jamie"". 

I'll be checking this thread somewhat regularly and will let you know as soon as I put the order in.

Also, don't make any requests other than through this post. I have gotten complaints from people asking me to stop doing this because they were getting harassed for free coffee (because they were mistaken as me or other reasons). It might seem funny but some people are getting pretty pissed off.

Enjoy!

For people who have been following along for the past bunch of years:

Sadly, this will likely be the last time I will be doing this. The points are getting much more difficult to collect and simultaneously devaluing. It's been fun every time though so thanks to everybody chiming in, paying it forward, sending nice notes, and so on!

Lastly, I'm currently at a Starbucks. If anybody is picking up at the location I'm at there'll be something extra. I'm not sure what yet but it'll be something.",1,1731535762.0,vancouver,1,1.0,False

The Buzz on the Spin

  
  


  
  


“I assure you young lady, my son did not engage in any sort of activity as you seem to be...”

  
  


“Then what about the other guy? Big on a human scale is TINY for a Gathara! Did he get it?”

  
  


“No. From my understanding Joseph is not the sort.”

  
  


The Snict sighs in disappointment at that.

  
  


“Hopefully the poor souls got pants in short order.” Observer Wu notes and Janet nods.

  
  


“They did, I helped a bit with that even.”

  
  


“Tell me, how common is it for cloning to be such an issue? This is the second mass cloning event that The Undaunted have been involved in since my ship and I have breached the edge of Cruel Space.”

  
  


“Wu sir, you have to remember that The Galaxy is a very, very big place. With so many people and opportunities that effectively everything that could happen in it IS happening in it and multiple instances at the very least. But they’re spaced so widely apart that you might go your entire life without encountering any of them even once! Meeting a new species for the first time is so common that there’s a shorthand so people don’t accidentally kill each other when having a new species on your ship. BMO, Bipedal Mammal Omnivore. Humans have that label for a reason. Because it’s needed.”

  
  


“And as such organizations that are trying to be part of many different things...”

  
  


“Run into those differently things at a very high rate compared to most. People tend to find what they’re looking for, and if they admit it or not, The Undaunted are usually looking for trouble.”

  
  


“I see, thank you for the explanation.” Observer Wu says. “So was there anything else happening at the time? I doubt the men working as home base control were sitting idle as Joseph and Daniel were making the acquaintance of the cloned men.”

  
  


“Of course they weren’t but I have to go off a bit of guess work here, I was only told what happened to my son and what he told me... it’s not perfect...”

  
  


“Just do what you can, a fair approximation to get the general idea is good to have.”

“Captain, we’re having a last second message from the station. I’m putting it through.” Her communications officer states and Captain Haltarak raises an eyeridge.

  
  


“And it’s about?”

  
  


“Unconventional profit.” Her officer says and she doesn’t need to see the teeth to know there is a massive smile there.

  
  


“As you were.” She answers. Then the screen lights up. The Tret looking Station Administrator nods to them.

  
  


“I’ll get to the point, the large ship that just came in has a population of modified Gathara clones on them. A large amount men. It’s not a profit in money but...”

  
  


“Reverse course, we’re heading back to the station.” Haltarak orders her crew. The Administrator smirks.

  
  


“We’re still talking to them and getting them to calm themselves. They don’t even have names, just numbers. I and my associates believe the best thing for them would be to get them among their own people and learning what it means to be Gathara. Step away from the vats that are producing another five thousand as we speak and be something.”

  
  


“More are being produced?”

  
  


“From what we can summarize. Initial negotiations are a little prickly. They’re understandably reluctant to talk.”

  
  


“Wise of them.” Captain Haltarak states. “Is our previous docking berth still available?”

  
  


“It is. Until this business is resolved the rental fee is waived.”

  
  


“Good.” She states and the contact is cut. Clones. Great.

Back on the ship both Demon and Hoagie were being escorted by the residents back up to the bridge. More and more of the formerly ‘invisible’ Gathara revealed by the black lights.

  
  


“So full Cloaken do not show up under these lights?”

  
  


“Their natural illusions are much more thorough and account for them. You need to get them on the infrared spectrum for the heat that escapes them. They can’t control that.”

  
  


“I see, would being reptiles not play into things?”

  
  


“Normally it does help them, but their movement and the energy from the Axiom they take in heats them to being somewhat warmer than most environments. To say nothing of the habit of wearing clothing giving a distinctive pattern.”

  
  


“So advanced stealth is difficult.”

  
  


“No, but every method of stealth has weaknesses and strengths. We could barely sense you without these lights. But we’d have a better impression of where Cloaken are with their distinct Axiom signature. We have meta-materials that render a person covered in them completely invisible to Axiom detection, or the senses of a being who uses Axiom. But they’re still there. Smoke moves around a gap, they still cast a shadow. Things like that are common stealth weaknesses.”

  
  


“And if something like that is accommodated for, and the effect on Axiom also compensated for?”

  
  


“Oh there’s always a slip up. The Axiom flows and shifts around us. Like smoke in it’s own way. Finding an area of calm that doesn’t seem effected by the surrounding Axiom as much is the telltale sign of very, very good stealth. But some are so keen to such disturbances that they notice that oddity first.”

  
  


“Really?” 242-3-4111 asks in his role of unofficial speaker. They reach the bridge and the ruins and scrapped remains of the combat drone are gone.

  
  


“Why did you use that thing anyways? A rusty rampaging robot with knives and the such is far less intimidating or dangerous than any of you.”

  
  


“We were still hiding. Any species could produce that robot, but it would send a clear message as to you being unwelcome.”

  
  


“Well... yes but it more provoked than discouraged us.”

  
  


“I imagine you are the type that is difficult to discourage.” 242-3-4111 says.

  
  


“You imagine correctly.” Demon states as he goes to the main controls. “Now, we’re going to bring the power up in this thing and start talking to the station. I get that you’re being careful, but swatting away an outstretched hand is just foolish.”

  
  


“It is what this will cost us that I am concerned with.” 242-3-4111 states.

  
  


“Well then, you need not worry. This is called, investment. We are giving up resources now to get more later. By having our station and our people be the first place you think of when you think of safety and plenty, it means you will come here often, likely bringing trade and news with you. Even if the whole of your numbers go their separate ways, you will all know this place as one that was good to you. You will be drawn back.”

  
  


“As resources?”

  
  


“As customers, trading partners and allies. Which are some sort of resources if one squints, but undeniably different from a mound of metal, a pallet of food or a pile of coin.”

  
  


“And if we formally request aid from The Undaunted?”

  
  


“Even better. Because the Station can get reimbursed on top of looking good.”

  
  


“And being paid for it due to lying about how much it cost.” 242-3-4111 notes with a shrewd sound to his voice.

  
  


“That’s called a markup, and that’s assumed as part of the basic fee.” Demon states. “And we have contact. Your friend won’t try to stop us will they?”

  
  


“No, the cameras are working, but look broken. We watched you.”

  
  


“Good to know.” Hoagie says as he directs the large ship to get within docking range of Octarin Spin.

  
  


“... Four One Eleven. There are multiple ships reversing course to dock.”

  
  


“The station is likely calling back other Gathara vessels. I doubt all of you will want to be Undaunted, so they’ll likely be thrilled to take those that don’t.”

  
  


“And if we want neither The Undaunted or other Gathara?”

  
  


“We will find an answer, but those are the two easiest ones.” Hoagie says.

“How many are left here?” The Snict asks.

  
  


“A couple hundred. Mostly in Sectors Two and Seven.” Janet says.

  
  


“So the fighting pits and the Bio-Tech area?” The Snict presses.

  
  


“Yes. Although they can be found all over the station. They even pop in here from time to time.” Janet says before suddenly looking to her communicator. “In fact... we’re going to have one in here shortly. He’s fond of my decaff coffee... but likes it frozen solid and with the mug. It’s very odd.”

  
  


“Frozen? I suppose for a reptile that would drop their internal temperature and work to put them to sleep.” The Snict notes.

  
  


“Ma’am, I have to ask you to leave. You’ve interrupted far too many times and...”

  
  


“I’m done, I won’t say anything more.” She promises.

  
  


“Anyways...”

It had been very easy to convince the Gathara clones to at least speak to the others. Especially after a few looms were repurposed to making clothing of the proper size and strength. Overalls for now, later would come more.

  
  


“Oh you are a handsome little boy aren’t you? How long have you been out of that pod?”

  
  


“Month. We are created full grown. Memories placed within us.” 1821-2-3208 states as he is unsure of what to do or say. “Third cycle is two weeks of age. Fourth is nearly finished.”

  
  


“Do we know who did this? Who is trying to create more?”

  
  


“Dead. Dead and thrown out, some fled.” 1821-2-3208 answers.

  
  


“Hmm... if they show themselves they show themselves. You need a name though. You all need names.” The Gathara woman states.

  
  


“Perhaps borrowing some Cloaken ones might help?” Demon remarks. Things were going well for the moment. Apparently there were old provisions and standards among the Gathara for what to do with orphaned children or men taken as plunder. Something the clones were falling into.

  
  


“Perhaps...” She says. There is a tension. There are a total of four ships that have Gathara on them, but the resources required were simply not enough. The captains agreed they needed to help but could not agree on who would carry how much of the burden, because none of them could support them all. But all of them wanted to seem to be the one who took the greatest burden. A prize of glory. She hadn’t explained it to a level either Demon or Hoagie could fully understand. There were missing assumptions and implications that neither man had been filled in on.

  
  


“Good news.” Hoagie says getting off his communicator. “We have a plan. You are familiar with Zalwore are you not?”

  
  


“We are.”

  
  


“The Undaunted are asking to charter your ships to transport the Gathara men that join up with them to Zalwore. During which time they will also be paying for a ‘cultural prompting’ so that these men have some idea as to what it means to be Gathara. For the actual training, housing and raising we have an arcology that is freshly built and has an enormous amount of space.” Hoagie says.

  
  


“What is an archology?” 1821-2-3208 asks.

  
  


“Arcology not Archology. An Arcology is a city building. Think space station hatchling, but on a planet instead. Technically everything here is one massive building. Like that.” Captain Haltarak says. “Zalwore is a very cold world.”

  
  


“And it’s very easy to make very warm clothing. The biggest advantage though is...”

  
  


“Location. You can get almost anywhere from there. Not to mention Gathara trade fleets move through so often that if they wish to cleave to their own it would be trivial to find a crew and family.” Haltarak says before nodding. “Yes. It is a good place. Cold. But good.”

  
  


“Why is cold a bad thing?” 1821-2-3208 asks.

  
  


“You have never left the ship have you not?”

  
  


“Never, only ship and now this station.” 1821-2-3208 admits.

  
  


“We are reptiles child. Much of our body energy and heat comes from outside. We can use Axiom to warm ourselves, but it exhausts. Makes us seek sleep.” Captain Haltarak says before nodding.

  
  


There is a crackle overhead.

  
  


“We’ve just had a solid dozen different ships just scream out of the Axiom Lane our new friends did. Get on alert. Someone might try something.” Admin announces from overhead and Haltarak followed by her fellow natural born Gathara and then the clones growl.

“A false alarm I hope.”

  
  


“It was not. Those who weren’t killed were back for what they thought was there’s.” Janet says before suddenly smiling. “And we have our next storyteller coming up! The big boy did fight after all.”

  
  


Observer Wu looks to the left to see what looks like an open jacket over a massive frame, huge loose jeans and a series of painted lines across an otherwise invisible chest and highlighting an unseeable face with a large muzzle on it. The unusual thing walks in, visibly ducking as it slips into the Diner.

  
  


“Miss Eastman, my usual please.” A voice that sounds more akin to grinding boulders says.

  
  


“Of course! It’s already ready and...”

  
  


“I’ll cover it if you’re willing to help Janet finish her story.”

  
  


“Story?” The Gathara man asks.

  
  


“He’s here on Official Earth business, that’s the human homeworld by the way, and he needs to know what so many humans have been up to.”

  
  


“So why am I involved?”

  
  


“The day you came to Octarin Spin was an odd one, so Observer Wu here needs to know what an odd day for this station is like before he sees what we consider normal.”

  
  


“For contrast?”

  
  


“Yes that is part of it. Also how other people perceive humans and other such important details.”

  
  


“How do I see humans? Well, you are living proof that strength of will and sheer gall can make up for just any physical disadvantage.” The big and mostly invisible man says.

  
  


“What’s your name for the record?”

  
  


“I was Six Five Two, Three, Five Thousand. Youngest of my cycle. Now I am Sarkonik Translucent Fierce.”

  
  


“Interesting name.”

  
  


It’s whatever name we like for our first name, the middle is a Cloaken name for the whole cycle, then broken down in the thousands for the last. Five thousand is bundled in with the four thousands.” Sarkonic answers.

  
  


“So the one that spoke first with Joseph and Daniel would also be a Translucent Fierce?”

  
  


“He is. He’s on Zalwore now. He took a human name. Bartholomew.” Sarkonic says and Observer Wu nods. “Hmm... I’ll have my usual after. I do like the story of our freedom and independence.”

  
  


“I’m glad to hear it, in both regards.” Observer Wu says. “Incidentally, what kind of life have you found here?”

  
  


“I’m an announcer in The Brawl Yards. My voice carries well and they love to hear it.”

  
  


“Good for you young man.” Wu says with a smile.

# Opening Thoughts

Have you ever taken a job that seemed perfect on paper, only to realize it was a complete mismatch once you were a few months in? I have—and let me tell you, it’s a frustrating and exhausting experience. You go in with high hopes, only to find yourself feeling stuck, unproductive, and questioning your career choices. I’ll never forget the time I took on a project management role at a startup. It sounded exciting, fast-paced, and full of opportunities for growth. But as the weeks went by, I realized the culture was anything but collaborative, and the constant firefighting wasn’t what I had signed up for. I lasted only six months.

This experience taught me one valuable lesson: job satisfaction isn’t just about the paycheck or the title; it’s about alignment—finding a role that matches your values, interests, and long-term goals. And in today’s hyper-connected world, you don’t have to go through the trial-and-error that I did. AI is here to help you make better-informed decisions right from the start.

# The Role of AI in Job Matching

# How AI is Changing the Game

Let’s get one thing straight: AI is not here to steal your job—it’s here to help you find the right job. With a growing number of AI-powered tools designed to assist in job searches, matching candidates with roles that align with their skills, values, and career goals has never been easier. Platforms like **Autojob** and **Sonara** can sift through thousands of job postings in minutes, finding opportunities tailored to your qualifications and preferences. These tools are more than just search engines; they’re personalized career advisors.

At first, I was skeptical about the idea of using AI for something as personal as job hunting. How could a machine, programmed with algorithms, understand the nuances of what I wanted in my career? But after trying it out, I was pleasantly surprised. AI tools don’t just throw random job listings at you—they analyze your resume, your job history, and even your preferences for company culture. They then match you with positions that aren’t just a good fit for your skills, but also for your personality and long-term career aspirations.

# Why You Should Give AI a Try

If you’re like many job seekers today, you might feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of options out there. AI simplifies the process by narrowing down your choices, saving you time and energy. And while it’s not perfect (yet), AI can help you avoid the dreaded mismatch that so many people experience when they rush into a new role without doing their homework.

But be careful—AI is a tool, not a crutch. You still need to do the legwork of assessing whether a role feels right for you. Let AI guide you, but don’t let it make decisions for you.

# Assessing Your Skills and Interests

# Getting to Know Yourself

Before you can find the job of your dreams, you need to have a solid understanding of your own strengths, weaknesses, and passions. This is where many people, including myself, often trip up. We think we know what we’re good at, but sometimes we’re too close to see the bigger picture. That’s where AI can lend a hand.

Tools like **SkillScanner** can analyze your resume, LinkedIn profile, and even your social media to identify patterns in your work history and highlight the skills you might not even realize you have. I remember using one of these tools and finding out that I had a knack for data analysis—a skill I had never considered a strong suit. But once the tool pointed it out, I started to see it. I had been using data to make decisions in almost every job I’d ever had, but I just hadn’t labeled it as a “skill.”

# AI-Driven Skill Assessments

Beyond analyzing your work history, AI can also help you discover hidden talents through online assessments. There are platforms like **Pymetrics** that use neuroscience-based games to evaluate your cognitive and emotional strengths. After taking one of their tests, I realized I had a natural ability for problem-solving under pressure—something I hadn’t fully appreciated about myself before.

These assessments don’t just give you a list of skills—they provide insights into the types of environments where you’re likely to thrive. Are you a natural-born leader? Do you excel in fast-paced, high-pressure situations? Or do you prefer a more structured, predictable work environment? Armed with this information, you’ll be better equipped to find a job that not only matches your skills but also aligns with your work style.

# Understanding Company Culture

# Why Culture Matters More Than You Think

It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of a new job offer, but before you sign on the dotted line, take a moment to think about the company culture. Does it align with your values? Will you fit in with the team? These are important questions to ask because company culture can make or break your job satisfaction.

In my early career, I took a job at a company that was known for its fast growth and innovative approach. It sounded great, but what I didn’t realize was that the company also had a “work hard, play hard” mentality that didn’t sit well with me. I’m more of a “work smart, live balanced” kind of person, and the constant pressure to stay late and attend after-hours events drained me. I lasted less than a year.

# How AI Can Help You Research Company Culture

AI tools like **Glassdoor** and **Comparably** can give you a behind-the-scenes look at what it’s really like to work at a company. These platforms aggregate employee reviews and ratings, offering insights into everything from work-life balance to management styles. But beyond just reading reviews, AI can take it a step further by analyzing patterns in the feedback. For example, if multiple employees mention a lack of growth opportunities or poor communication from leadership, you’ll know it’s a red flag.

I once used an AI-powered tool to dig into a company I was interested in. The reviews were generally positive, but the AI flagged a recurring theme: employees felt like the company’s mission wasn’t clearly communicated, leading to confusion and frustration. That was a dealbreaker for me, and I decided to pass on the job. Without AI, I might not have caught that subtle but important detail.

# Job Descriptions vs. Reality

# The Disconnect Between Job Postings and Actual Roles

We’ve all been there: you find a job posting that sounds perfect, but when you start the job, it’s nothing like what you expected. Maybe the responsibilities are different, or the work environment isn’t what was advertised. This happens more often than you might think. In fact, a recent survey found that 72% of job seekers were surprised by aspects of their new role after starting the job.

# How AI Helps Bridge the Gap

AI can help you avoid this disappointment by analyzing job descriptions and comparing them to actual employee experiences. Tools like **Blind** and **Fishbowl** allow employees to share candid insights about their jobs, and AI can sift through this data to identify potential discrepancies between what’s advertised and what’s real.

For example, I once came across a job posting for a marketing manager role that sounded like a dream. But after using an AI tool to analyze employee feedback, I discovered that many people in the same role were frustrated by the lack of creative freedom. The job turned out to be more about following strict guidelines than coming up with innovative ideas. If I hadn’t done my homework, I would’ve walked into a job that wasn’t right for me.

# Networking with AI Assistance

# The Power of Networking (Even If You're an Introvert)

Networking is one of those necessary evils of job searching. It can be especially daunting for introverts or people who don’t have a large professional network. But here’s where AI can be a game-changer. AI-driven platforms like **LinkedIn**’s **Career Explorer** or **GPT for Sheets** can help you find connections you didn’t even know you had. These tools can map out potential contacts based on your work history, education, and even mutual acquaintances.

# Building Meaningful Connections with AI

I used to dread networking. It felt forced and awkward. But when I started letting AI do some of the heavy lifting, things got a lot easier. For example, I used **GPT for Sheets** to generate a list of people in my field who were connected to someone I already knew. The tool then helped me craft personalized messages for each person, making the outreach feel more natural.

One of those connections turned out to be a key player in helping me land a job I hadn’t even considered. We had an informal chat over coffee, which led to an introduction to a hiring manager. That conversation opened doors I didn’t even know existed, and it all started with a simple AI tool.

# Trial and Error: Internships and Freelancing

# The Value of Short-Term Positions

If you’re not ready to commit to a full-time role, internships and freelance gigs can be a great way to test the waters. These short-term positions allow you to explore different industries, roles, and work environments without the long-term commitment. Plus, they’re a fantastic way to build your resume and expand your network.

# Finding Opportunities with AI

AI can help you find internships and freelance gigs that align with your interests and skills. Tools like **Upwork** and **Freelancer** use AI algorithms to match you with projects that fit your profile. And if you’re looking for internships, platforms like **InternMatch** use AI to connect you with companies that are actively seeking candidates with your background.

I once took on a freelance project through an AI-powered platform that ended up being a game-changer for my career. It was a short-term contract, but it gave me valuable experience in a new industry and led to several full-time job offers down the road. If I hadn’t taken that chance, I might have missed out on some incredible opportunities.

# Decision-Making with AI Insights

# Balancing Data with Gut Instinct

AI can provide you with a wealth of data to help you make informed career decisions, but at the end of the day, you still need to trust your gut. No algorithm can fully capture your personal preferences, intuition, or emotional response to a job offer. It’s about finding a balance between the data AI provides and your own instincts.

# How AI Informed My Decision-Making Process

When I was deciding between two job offers, I used AI tools to compare the companies, the roles, and even the potential for growth. The data pointed me toward one company, but something didn’t feel right. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it, but my gut was telling me to go with the other offer. In the end, I trusted my instincts, and it turned out to be the right choice. The company I chose offered more flexibility and a better work-life balance—something the AI tools hadn’t fully captured.

# Long-Term Career Growth Considerations

# Thinking About the Future

It’s easy to focus on the here and now when you’re job hunting, but it’s important to think about where a role could take you in the future. Will this job help you grow? Does the company offer opportunities for advancement? These are questions you should be asking before you accept any offer.

# Using AI to Predict Career Growth

AI tools like **LinkedIn Career Insights** can help you forecast your career trajectory by analyzing job market trends and identifying roles that are likely to offer long-term growth. These tools can also show you how others in your industry have progressed in their careers, giving you a roadmap for your own journey.

I had a friend who used one of these tools to explore career growth in her field. She realized that her current job didn’t offer much room for advancement, so she made the tough decision to switch industries. It wasn’t an easy choice, but the AI data helped her see the bigger picture, and she’s now thriving in a new role with plenty of opportunities for growth.

# Final Thoughts

# Embrace Technology, But Stay True to Yourself

AI is an incredible tool that can help you find the right job, assess your skills, and even navigate the complex world of networking. But at the end of the day, it’s just that—a tool. It’s up to you to make the final decisions and ensure that your career path aligns with your personal values and goals.

I’ve been through the highs and lows of job searching, and I’ve learned that finding the right job is about more than just matching skills to roles. It’s about understanding yourself, your needs, and your long-term aspirations. AI can guide you along the way, but only you can decide what truly makes you happy and fulfilled.

So take advantage of the technology available to you, but don’t lose sight of who you are and what you want out of your career. With the right balance of AI data and personal intuition, your dream job is just around the corner.

The atmosphere aboard the dreadnought was tense. There were a few moments of negotiation about whether Penny would go over to Gord's ship, or Gord to Penny's but in the end, Gord blinked first. Probably because he knew that Home still had their stardrive pointed at Penny's ship.

The ships connected, Gord and Chloe came over and were led to a conference room right off the airlock. A steward - knowing they were both AIs - offered them coffee or tea, and to her immense surprise, Gord accepted. A few moments after the coffee was delivered, Penny and Zhe came in. As she stepped in, a guard attempted to follow them, and Zhe stared at him and shook her head. His eyes flicked to Penny's and she nodded, and he saluted sharply and stepped back out.

""That was the 'this is insane, but you are the commander, so I will do what you say' salute if I ever saw one."" Gord said, grinning around his coffee. Penny looked at Gord, surprised. Zhe just smirked and flicked her ears.

As they both sat Gord put his coffee down. ""Feeling a little overwhelmed, Empress? It's okay, we're among friends here.""

Penny glared at Gord for the barest split second, then her shoulders slumped and she leaned back in her chair, staring at the ceiling. ""I have *no idea* what I'm doing."" She said to the ceiling. Penny continued, ""Fen left on the expeditionary force - I told her she didn't need to go, but she insisted, then we get an emergency beacon from the **K'laxi** of all people saying that they're breaking away from the Empire, oh and not only that they are fighting against the nanites - which the general public didn't know about - *but now they do*, and that there isn't an *Empress anymore* and what can we do but assume she was killed along with the expeditionary force!"" She tilted her head just enough to see Gord, ""they were destroyed I assume?"" He nodded once. She looked back up at the ceiling. ""I immediately declare myself Empress - along with about a dozen other people across colonial space and now it's a race to see who can build the largest coalition of support and-"" she sighed ""-probably fight a couple of civil wars before the new leader of humanity is declared."" She sat up and locked eyes with Gord. ""Then, I scramble to get whatever ship will let me on out to Home so I can go ask the AIs - who just recently came back and said they were willing to work with us - for help figuring out what *the fuck* is happening, and I get ignored and sure, maybe I overreact a little and sent a couple shots over your bow to get your attention. Someone from out past Jupiter tells me to stuff it, and then Home aims their **stardrive** at me. So **yes** Gord, I am feeling 'a little overwhelmed'"" She trudges over to the sideboard in the conference room, pours a water, downs it in one gulp, pours another, and then sits back down. ""So then, Gord and Chloe, representatives of the AI faction, what do you want to discuss.""

Chloe shifts awkwardly in her seat. ""Well, we-""

""Did you know I was a spy?"" Penny said, unprompted. ""My aim never was for power. I was assigned to watch Fen, keep my superiors apprised about what she was doing - mostly with her K'laxi black projects team - and to try and steer her away from any *actually* damaging courses of action. I wasn't supposed to fall for her!"" It was practically a wail. ""I know she holds a candle for her dead wife and will probably never actually love anyone else, doesn't matter I still loved her! Now, she's gone, and I don't know if she's alive or dead, and the Nanites are acting real strange and the whole thing is going to crash down, and if I survive the next year it'll be an Ancestors provided *miracle*."" She stifled a sob and took another sip of water and sniffed. ""So, if you have *any* idea where Fen went, please, *please* tell me.""

Gord looked at Chloe. There was a second of them staring at each other. Communicating? Just staring? Zhe wasn't sure. Finally Chloe blinked and scoffed. ""Fine."" She said.

""Well Penny - Penelope - *Empress*..."" Gord said, kindly. ""We don't *exactly* know... anymore.""

\*\*\*\*

Fen drifted in and out of conciseness. Her suit had her partially reclined, and she was well supported, and the suit was warm and quiet and she was so tired. So very tired. Was she sleeping, or was she passing out? Did it matter? She blinked and the gray of the virus took up a small portion of the nebula. She blinked again, and half the nebula was gray. Blinking again, it was all gray. Shit, this was bad. ""Suit?"" She said. ""How long has it been since we linked here?""

TWENTY STANDARD SOL HOURS.

Nearly a day. Didn't feel like it. She ached, her limbs felt tired and cold and she wasn't hungry. Shouldn't she be hungry? She drank a little water from the straw near her mouth, and suddenly her mouth was incredibly parched. She sucked the water in greedy slurps until the pouch was empty. It would refill overtime from expelled moisture from her breath, and processed waste, and even from the spare oxygen and hydrogen it could capture from interstellar space, but, she might get one more pouch of water that way. If she was going to survive she needed to do something.

""But what, Fen? What the *fuck* do I do now?"" She said to herself. There was nobody near, nobody who knew where she was - unless Gord or Chloe thought to scan for the backpack's link signature. Supposedly that was possible, but it was difficult, and not terribly accurate and would... require them knowing... she left. Dammit. Chloe knew she left, Fen thought, but she had cut her comm.

Wait a moment, the backpack had enough power for *two* trips, one 'there' and one 'back.' She brought up the link backpack's overlay and... yes, it could link exactly one more time.

But where?

She could link back to Sol, but would anyone be able to find her in time? Did the backpack have a directory of common locations? If she linked in the middle of the shipping lane for Parvati, would they see her, or would she just be another bit of debris destroyed by the stationkeeping lasers of a Starjumper linking in? Scrolling through the settings, Fen saw that it didn't really have a directory. The backpack was clearly one step above a prototype. There was a log of previous addresses, but they didn't detail where they were. Her only option was to wait here, and hope Gord or Chloe put two and two together and got six, or link back to Sol, and scream on comms until she died, or was rescued.

Fen sighed. Was it even a choice?

She toggled the return, and the backpack linked her away from the white hole, and the remains of the nanites.

Fen sat on the forest floor, hugging her knees. Ma sat next to her, leaning her head on Fen's shoulder. ""You should be *proud* hon. You did it."" She straightened up. ""Not only that, but you did it yourself, with your own idea. It wasn't Gord's idea, or Zhe's, or Penny's or mine. It was *yours*.""

Fen smiled as she clutched her knees. ""I am pretty awesome, aren't I?""

""You know I know you are."" Ma said, her ears flicking.

""But Ma, what am I going to do now? Defeating the nanites was just the start. If I get picked up, If I survive, If we can figure out the K'laxi...""

""All decisions you have the privilege, the honor to make, because you took the step to stop the nanites. Humanity is in charge of their destiny again. The other stuff?"" Ma nuzzled Fen's neck. ""That's just details.""

Fen was in space still, but this was different. For one, the yellow-white light of Sol shone on her, warming her suit, not the sharp blue white of the white hole. For another, her comm lit up with dozens of frequencies, all clearing for the emergency trill of her rescue beacon. For a third... three quarters of Fen's view was taken up by the colony ship the AI called Home, only a couple hundred kilometers away.

Of course. She was on Gord's ship before and that was right next to Home. She'd return to the same location, and would naturally still be next to home. Fen sighed and drifted off as red and white sparkles of emergency ships soared towards her.",2,1731535013.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1gqoqbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gqoqbd/theres_a_framed_family_photo_wall_in_my_home/,"There's a framed family photo wall in my home. Recently, I noticed a new one of a complete stranger.","My name is Nick Bannon. I’m about six feet tall. Skinny build. My curly hair and eyebrows are a dark brown, and my eyes are bright blue. A strange start to my story, I know, but it’s only because I know the inevitable. It’s going to happen again. I don’t know where, and I don’t know who to, but I have a feeling it’s been happening for a while. I’m just another small link in a long, long chain.



If there’s a photo in your home that matches the description above, you’re in danger. All I can advise is that you get out. Get out as fast as you can and share my story with somebody, anybody who will believe you. I’ve written it out below, as quickly as I could under the circumstances. I don’t think I have much longer. It’s going to find me soon.



————————————————————



My Mother died two months ago. Lung cancer. We weren’t very close, especially at the end, but I’d been the only family she didn’t despise. Because of this, the majority of her possessions were left to me. This included an old blue truck, a storage unit full of tattered furniture and old clothes, and a split level house at the end of a long country road.



The house itself was in okay shape. There were some exterior walls that looked a bit rough, but it was old. Good bones, as they say. I decided I’d move into it, at least for the time being. I was between jobs, and it felt like as good a place as any to crash for a little bit. I packed what few belongings I had from my shitty studio apartment and left the city in my rearview mirror.



Things were normal for the first few days. It felt good to be away from the chaos that I’d grown accustomed to. My closest neighbor was two miles away, and I barely saw any cars drive by. I’d forgotten the value of silence from time to time. 



However, pretty quickly it got to the point where it was too silent. Soon, every creak made me jump, every gust of wind sounded like an intruder, and it was driving me crazy. I decided that I needed a project. Something to fill the silence. Pass the time. I had a lot of it these days. I looked around at all of Mom’s tacky inspirational wall hangings and her dated velvet furniture and decided that it felt too much like her in there. If I was going to live there, I was going to make it mine.



I had a yard sale that had a pretty great turnout, despite my isolated location. Pretty much everything went, and what didn’t get sold got donated to a local thrift store. I shampooed the carpet, painted the walls, tended to the garden, all things that Mom probably hadn’t done in years. By the time I was finished, the entire house almost looked brand new. I bought some new furniture with the yard sale money, threw up a few horror movie posters, and soon enough this place was starting to feel like mine. 



————————————————————



It had been easy to get rid of Mom’s stuff because, quite frankly, most of it had been ugly. The only things that stuck around were her framed portraits, the ones that climbed the stairs. They were family photos. A dozen semi-familiar faces dotted them sporadically, and I found myself staring at them from time to time, wondering what they were up to now. It felt odd. I’d been alone for so long that the thought of a family this big being *my* family didn’t make sense in my head. 



I started getting in the habit of greeting them each morning. I know, it sounds weird, but grief is a strange thing. I felt comfort in it. As I’d been clearing out everything, I’d found a family photo album. Using that, I’d been able to match a lot of the names to faces. Aunt Grace popped up a lot throughout the frames, as did my Uncle Rob. I even saw myself as a baby a few times. It took a while, but soon I had each of them memorized. That’s why I’d noticed the new photo almost instantly.



Every single one of the frames had a thick, black frame, no matter the photo size. It gave the wall a nice, uniform look. Mother had liked them that way. The new one stood out from the rest. It was made up of plastic roses, each one a different shade of red.



The image inside of the roses was of a woman. She was ice skating alone on some pond, surrounded by brush and thick snow. The photo was taken from a few yards away, through the branches of a dead tree. It was like photographer had been crouching a few yards away. Hiding. 



When I went to take the frame off the wall, I was met with…wetness. The entire frame was covered in some sort of thick, clear goo that had started to pool on the stairs. My stomach churned at the sight of it. I took my shirt off and used it as a sort of glove to carry it to my kitchen table.



I stared at it for a long time. Half of my brain was searching my early memories for the skating woman. Maybe she was a long lost relative, or maybe a friend of Mother’s? But that wouldn’t explain the photo showing up out of nowhere. I’d passed that photo wall dozens of times, and I was almost certain that it hadn’t been there before. It also wouldn’t explain that disgusting goo.



At that point, I was weirded out and confused, but I wasn’t scared. I’d heard about strange things happening in the woods, how it can play tricks on your mind. That had to be it. I tossed the frame into the garbage. I didn’t want it anywhere near me. I thought that’d be the end of it. Just a strange occurrence, nothing more.



That morning, I skipped saying hello to the photos. There was an imposter. It didn’t feel right.



————————————————————



Later that day I decided to take the truck into town and run a few errands I was putting off. I needed to get out of the house. It felt like I had that disgusting goo all over me, even after a shower. Being in town helped a little bit, but not much. At the convenience store, the cashier picked up on my off mood.



“You doin’ okay, sweetie? You look pale.” She said, bagging my groceries. I lied and told her I was fine, and forced our conversation to turn towards the weather.



“I’m just getting sick of those storms,” I said. “I know some people say they help them sleep, but not me”



The woman gave me a weird look. “Storms? What storms? It’s been bone dry for weeks! You sure you’re okay?”



“Oh, uh…yeah. Yeah, I’m fine.” I stammered, grabbing my groceries. I hurried out of there and got in the truck. What had she meant by no storms? I’d been seeing lightning every night pretty much since I’d moved in. Maybe she lived in a different county. Yes. That had to be it. 



I drove around for an hour or two before heading back. The skating woman wouldn’t leave my head. When I finally returned to the house, it had started to get dark. Night time out in the middle of nowhere was no joke. I brought the groceries in and put them away. I cooked a small chicken dinner, cleaned the dishes, and shut the house down for the night. I needed to sleep. It wasn’t until I went to shut off the front porch lights that I noticed it.



The photo of that skater. It was back in its place on the wall, right along with the others. A fresh layer of goo was dripping off of it like slimy teardrops.



*Alright,* I thought. *Now I’m scared.*



————————————————————



I didn’t end up getting much sleep that night. I laid in bed and stared at the ceiling in a daze. The sounds of the old house sounded even louder in the dark. There wasn’t a storm, at least not one that I noticed. In the morning, I checked every single nook and cranny in this house, looking for any sort of explanation on who’d moved the photo while I’d been gone. It had to be an intruder, but there were no signs of forced entry. The windows had been rusted shut years ago, so there was no chance of someone shimmying in that way. All of the doors had been locked as well. Deadbolted.



Outside, I saw no footprints or tire marks that weren’t the truck’s. Nobody else was here but me, at least according to the physical evidence. After a paranoid few hours of searching, I got fed up. I started a fire in the backyard and threw the photo into it. It almost sounded like it was screaming as it went up in smoke. I stood there until I was sure it was charred beyond repair before I doused the flame.



The next day I had someone from SPC Security come out and installed a home alarm system, complete with a tablet that controlled its every move. It was very fancy. The man showed me how to arm and disarm the system, and helped me create an access code. After he left I felt a bit better. At least now I’d know if something in the house was moving while I wasn’t.



The photo hadn’t returned, thank god, but I still felt weird about the photo wall. What had once given me comfort now felt wrong. I took the photos down and put them in a box that I shoved into a closet. The stairwell looked bare afterwards, like I’d ripped all of its teeth out, but I felt good. It felt like I had things under control.



That night, I got into bed with the security tablet laying on my bedside table. I armed the house with my access code, and I drifted off to sleep as the lightning began once more.



————————————————————



The alarm clock read 3:45 a.m when I was startled awake. There was a sound.



*ACK! ACK!*



I squinted through the pitch black, still half asleep. I couldn’t see anything.



*ACK! BLECH! ACK!*



Whatever it was was loud. Really loud. The sound was like a blend of a sick puking cat and a human cough. I rubbed my eyes with some force and peered into the darkness again.



*ACK! ACK! ACK!*



As my eyes began to adjust, I saw it. In the corner. Something was there. Crouching. Vibrating. Twitching. It was hard to make out its shape in the dark. It looked human. At least, it was big enough to be one. The only thing I could see was a tiny red light, right where its eye should be.



Terror had stapled me to the bed. Every fiber of my being wanted to tear out of there, but that…that *thing* was right by the bedroom door.



*ACK!*



This time it was louder. I saw it wretch over, like it’d been punched in the stomach. It smacked its lips as its shoulders twitched back and forth with the sound of crunching, shifting bones.



I noticed the security tablet sitting next to me. Earlier, the guy had said that if I hit the side button three times, the police would automatically be called. It was about a foot away from my reach. Moving as slow as I could manage, I stretched my arm across the bed. My fingers grazed the edge of the screen. I pressed down and started to drag it towards me, but instead of falling onto the bed, it fell onto the floor with a soft clunk.



The shape in the corner jumped up onto its feet with a sharp, guttural inhale. It looked over at me. I made eye contact with its…its eye light. We were both still for a moment, studying each other, until it darted from the room and out into the hallway. I heard a faint *ACK* before the ear-piercing alarm began to go off. It must have moved enough to trigger it.



With tears in my eyes, I reached down to the tablet and shakily clicked the side button three times.



————————————————————



I waited out by the road for the cops. The further from the house, the better. Whatever…*it* was, it was still in there.



Since I lived so far from town, it took longer for the local sheriff to reach me. I’d started to shiver by the time I saw the lights through the trees. This town was small enough to only have a sheriff and a deputy, and they’d both shown up for my call.



“So you saw an intruder in the house?” The sheriff asked. He seemed doubtful. Nothing of that sort happened out here in the sticks. I was sure these guys had never dealt with any *real* crime.



“Yes. I think it’s…he’s still in there. Upstairs.”



The sheriff went inside to look around while the deputy surveyed the property. I remained in my spot by the mailbox. I probably looked crazy, standing out there alone in nothing but my boxers, but I didn’t care. My heart hadn’t stopped its incessant beating, and a cold sweat had formed on my brow. I was just focused on not passing out in front of these cops.



After what felt like years, the sheriff exited the house and met back up with his partner. They exchanged a few words I couldn’t hear before coming to join me again by the road.



The sheriff spoke first. “The house is clear, sir. I looked everywhere, checked all the windows, everything. No signs of forced entry.”



“I didn’t saw nothin’ neither, “ the deputy tacked on. “I checked e’rywhere. No footprints, nuthin’. It’s just you here, sir.”



I couldn’t believe my ears. I wanted to force them back inside, make them check again, make them see what I saw. But I saw that look in the sheriff’s eye. Concern mixed with secondhand embarrassment. Here I was, a paranoid guy in his underwear, lamenting about an intruder in his isolated house. If I kept it up, they might just take me back to the tiny station downtown.



I decided to lie. “I’m embarrassed, officers. I apologize. My Mom died recently, and I just…I must be seeing things. I’m exhausted.” 



The officers looked at me, then at each other. The deputy took a step forward and put a hand on my bare shoulder.



“It’s all good, boy. You’s Mom was a town gem. Everyone loved her. We did at the station, too. She had her fair share of calls down to the station. Was never anything, though. Seems like the apple don’t fall far from the tree, right sheriff?”



The sheriff was not as polite as his deputy. “Get back inside and get some sleep. It looks like you need it. Goodnight, son. Sorry for your loss.”



I waved goodbye with a still-shaking hand as they turned around in my driveway. On their way out, the detective slowed to a stop right by me. He held a flyer out the window.



“Hey. I promised the family I’d hand these to everyone I came across. Keep an eye out, will ya?”



They drove away and disappeared into the trees. I unfolded the flyer. It was a missing poster. There was a thick block of text above a photo.



MISSING: JULIA HELMS

AGE: 32

LAST SEEN: NEAR COPPERHEAD WOODS

ANY INFORMATION SHOULD BE REPORTED TO 1-555-685-0928



I recognized the face in the photo. I’d watched it burn in my fire pit earlier that day.



————————————————————



Mother’s house had become a threat. I couldn’t sleep. I could barely eat. I stopped opening the windows in the morning and mainlined coffee to stay awake. I patrolled the house with a hammer in one hand and a baseball bat in the other. Overkill, I know, but what else could I do? 



After some digging online, I found an article about the missing woman. Julia Helms. According to the Slow Turtle Gazette, she owned a local hobby store called Sew Chic, and had been an avid ice skater. Just last year she’d won a national title. In the attached photos, she was smiling the same way she’d been on my wall. I began to see that face everywhere, especially when I shut my eyes. It was etched into everything.



I was in a strange position. What was I going to do, go down to the station and tell those cops that something was living in my house? That it was leaving pictures of a missing woman on my walls? They’d definitely take me in then, especially considering my little stunt the other night. I didn’t even have the damn photo anymore. Even if I did, having a previously unseen photo of a woman the day she went missing wasn’t a good look. 



That wasn’t all. There was something else that I kept coming back to, something that I just couldn’t let go of. The angle. The way the photographer had been hiding. Waiting. It did the same in my home for three days before it showed up again.



————————————————————



I’d gone to the shop again that morning for food. Julia’s missing posters were taped on every light pole in town. I tried not to look at them, but I still saw her in my periphery. That smile kept passing me at 30 miles per hour, punching me in the gut each time. Mindful of the groceries in the bed of the truck, I slowly upped my speed until I was back in the thick forest. Nobody bothered with the posters out here.



As I approached the house, I noticed something in the front yard. Little bits of white were strewn across my front lawn, like confetti. I parked the truck and approached my porch with extreme caution. The little pieces were everywhere. I picked one up and held it up close, making eye contact with half of my Aunt Grace’s smiling face.



Mother’s photos, once the heart of the house, had been torn to pieces and cast out carelessly on the grass. Some pieces got caught in the wind and blew up and out into the trees.



The inside of the house was trashed. It was like a tornado had come through and destroyed everything in its path. The fridge had been ransacked, and food was thrown on the walls and smeared onto the windows. Furniture was upside down, pillows were ripped open and gutted. There was also the goo coating the floor, making it slippery. It was like the trail a snail leaves behind. I tried not to vomit as I made my way through the first floor, a butter knife clasped in my shaking hand. Don’t laugh. It was the only weapon I could find on short notice.



In the hall closet, the box that I’d put the family photos in was shredded. I checked to see if any survived the carnage, but there weren’t any. That thing had taken each of the photos out of the frames and destroyed them. I couldn’t figure out why, though. What did it want with the frames?



A sound upstairs caught my attention. *ACK! ACK!* *CLUNK!* I rounded the corner just in time to see something tumble down the stairs. It was the security tablet. Shattered. I picked it up, wincing as a piece of broken glass got shoved into my thumb.



ACK! It coughed again, closer this time. It was coming from the top of the steps now. I dropped the tablet onto the ground where it landed with a splash in a pile of goo. There, at the top of the stairs, I saw it. It was shrouded in the darkness of the upstairs hallway, but it was there. I saw its skinny, vibrating body. I saw its bright red eye. I saw…I saw…



The photo wall. It was back. The frames were hanging again, although crooked. All twenty-four of them were there. They covered in a dripping mess that ran down the wall in thick ropes. Now, though, instead of the smiling faces of my family, all I saw looking back at me was…me. They were all photos of me. Sleeping. In each one, the flash was bright enough to wash my skin out.



I remembered those nights. All that lightning.



*BLACH! ECK! ACK!*



It held up its bony hand to block the sun from its eye. There was something embedded in his palm, a sort of…glass ball. It glistened in the light. 



*ACK!*



The glass bulb in its palm was inches from my nose. I heard nothing besides the sound of a small whirring, like something winding up. It was the last thing I heard before I was blinded.



————————————————————



I’m not too sure how to describe this next part. It’s going to sound crazy, but it’s the stone cold truth. The thing in its hand…I guess you could say it’s a camera. Or, maybe it itself is a camera. I still don’t really know for sure. When I came to, the thing had started shaking. It held onto the railing for support as it jerked from left to right, sending dribbles of its spit all over the entry way.



I’d backed myself into the corner of the room, as far away as I could get. My head was pounding. Terrified, I crossed my arms and folded my legs up into my chest. I wanted to make myself as small as possible. I wanted it all to be over. I wanted my Mother.



*ACK! ACK!*



Through my shaking fingers, I watched the thing stumble its way down the final few steps on all fours. It was still coughing, arching its back like a sick cat with each heave. After a few heavy purges of goo, I saw something fall out of its throat and onto my carpet. It was a photo. It was *my* photo. My horrified face took up the entire page.



The thing grabbed the paper from the ground and flattened it. It looked at me with that bright eye for a few moments before reaching over and tossing it in my lap. I noticed what looked to be a smile creep up on its thin lips. It seemed proud of its work.



Before I could even think about my next move, I swung the butterknife. It landed with a dull thunk somewhere on the side of its thick head. An inhuman wail spilled from its wet mouth as it backed into the wall with force. The crash rattled some of the photos of my sleeping body tumbling off the wall. I snuck past the thing as it tugged at the knife handle in its face, taking the steps two at a time.



An armoire that my Mother had bought ages ago still stood in her old craft room upstairs. It was big enough for me to just barely fit inside. I climbed in and shut the doors quietly. 



I’ve been in here ever since.



————————————————————



Like I said at the top, there isn’t much time for me. There aren’t a lot of hiding places in this house. It’s sure to pull open the armoire doors at some point in time. What happens to me then I’m not sure. Perhaps I’ll face the same fate as Julia Helms. Perhaps I’ll find a way to escape, although that seems doubtful.



There’s a crack in the door of the armoire. As I’ve been writing, I’ve peered through it and witnessed that thing pass through this room a few times. Each time, it brings one of the frames from the wall and adds it to a line it started on the floor. It’s laying each one out. At first I wasn’t sure what it was up to, but I think I know now.



I remember Julia’s photo. The frame of roses that it lived in.  I think that thing forced her to choose a frame for her photo, and now it was setting me up to do the same. Not that I’d have much choice. Mother had liked the uniform black, after all.



Please, please remember. My name is Nick Bannon. I’m about six feet tall. Skinny build. My curly hair and eyebrows are a dark brown, and my eyes are bright blue. If you see me in your home, in a thick, black frame…be cautious. Tell mine and Julia’s stories. And if this thing comes for you next, I hope you can kill it. 



I only wounded it, it seems.

This is by no means a criticism but a genuine question that has baffled me for a couple of years. A short info about me: I'm a Pakistani guy working as an engineer in Finland. I have been thinking about these questions for quite some time but I have no answer and couldn't come up with a logical explanation. I'm looking for natives' perspective on these questions:

1. Why is making Finnish connections so difficult? I have been here for 3 years and despite speaking the language at a basic level and being very active with hobbies and social activities. No one seems to be interested. Why is everyone so reserved, and uninterested in making social connections? It is very strange, I even invited people over, offered them meals and coffee but that didn't reciprocate to anything. They just disappeared over time, and I had to initiate the meeting every single time. Eventually it got tiring that I had to put all the effort, the friendships felt one-sided.
2. Do Finns enjoy this silent culture? Or they also suffer from loneliness but got used to it?
3. Do natives also think that their society is closed-off? Or they prefer that over extrovert cultures?
4. Why many people here bottle up their emotions ? Is showing emotions or expressing controversial opinions seen as a weakness?

I have lived in a few different countries as an adult, and despite challenges that come with immigration. All countries seemed to be more open. People there asked me questions, and they were interested in knowing me. Finland is the only place where I have felt that everyone seems bothered that they have to socialize. 

Do war traumas play a role? Or is it related to cold winters,...?

# ""Why did it have to be me?""



Memory Transcription: \[Jane Mitchell, “US impromptu ambassador to the Aliens”\]

Date \[Standardized Human Date\]: \[January 13th, 2011\]



Oh god, oh god, oh god, calm the fuck down Jane, this is just another diplomatic post.



Involving space sheep and space rabbits.



Jesus fucking Christ, why did it have to be me???  
  


By some stroke of bad luck and being near I was the one chosen by the Department of State to be the ambassador to these aliens for now until someone else more experienced enters the picture.



But for now, it's me, some rookie who should not be here, but here I am, and I'm not the only one.



Alongside me is Claire Beaumont, the French ambassador smoking her 5th pack this day. 



Another young ambassador that should not be here and one that will be replaced in some time too, lucky us.



“*You really don't want one*?” She tells me as she shows me the pack of cigarettes, how many packs did she pack for here?



I swear to god if I open her luggage case it's going to be filled with those, that lady isn't going to see past 40.



“*No, and you should cut them, I know we're stressed as shit but calm the fuck down with the cigarettes, I will get secondhand smoke lung cancer from you,*” I tell her as she just snarks and throws the cigarette down, and stomps it just leaving the ash.



Then one of the ""Venlils"" approaches us.



Even though they look almost harmless, being now in one of their ships alone, cut off from Earth, reminds me of the phrase my dad always used to tell me, “Don't judge a book by its cover.” 



Maybe they use this “harmless” look because they have to be more menacing and wrathful, or I'm just going into conspiracy theorist mode.



“*Stop stinking the room you go in human with those smokes*,” it tells us as it walks off, and Claire looks a bit shocked after this.



“*Do you think they are harder on stuff like this back in their home than we already are here, I really hope I didn't accidentally offend them by smoking*” I just sigh at Claire's response.



“*Look I think they don't mind you smoking but that was your 5th pack this day, I think they do mind you filling any room you go with smoke,*” I tell her as she just decides to put her lighter back in her bag begrudgingly. 



“*Look Claire we are all stressed here, for god's sake I don't think we even knew we were going to be in this situation a week ago, and I think I watched too many alien movies the last few weeks for my own sake,*”  I say as I rubbed my eyes.



“*At least I don't feel so dumb now*,” Claire said, as she smiled at me.



“*Shut up,”* I told her, as she just scoffed and muttered “*Putain d'Américain*” quietly but enough to get to the gist of it, whatever that meant,  picked one of the books from the table right in front of us, that was translated into our language.



We continue to wait in this room, as familiar and alien as it is, it almost feels like a lobby in a small clinic, even if I'm in the middle of a spaceship right now.



The room itself isn't that big. But big enough to host several of us, around 17 people of all colors and banners waiting for their turn to get in.



With me ended up being with the smoking hazard that is Claire, well mostly because they have been alongside me since when they took us from New York to here, now waiting patiently for my turn, since the fuckers had the gall to let the Cuban ambassador first.



Maybe I should be counting my blessings. I'm in a way better state of mind now than I was some time ago.



The reception is there staffed by 3 of those bunny things.



Sivkits? I think that's what you call them.



You can see some small decorations in the form of alien plants nearby, a small tv in the upper right corner of us putting some “relaxing music”, something akin to space jazz is the closest I can describe it too.



But the more conspiracy theorist side of me is screaming “MIND CONTROL WAVES” as I remind myself binge binge-watching alien movies and series was not a good idea.



In front of us is a “coffee” table, with some books and pamphlets and not all written in English, I already read some of that stuff. It's just some introductory information about them, where they come from, what they want with us, etc.



Which, for now, seems to be “peaceful,” but the reason they have us here is to discuss more ""in-depth” plans regarding each country and how they want to help us get better.



The best-case scenario is some shit like star trek, I guess, worst case though…..



I don't even want to imagine what the worst case is, probably something akin to the thing.



Fuck I really *really* want to smoke but I think being just alongside Claire for this time was enough for one month.



“*The ambassador of the United States of America*?” One of the sheeps said as I looked at them like a deer looking at headlights, I just raised my hands up.



“*Follow me, the Cuban ambassador is done speaking with the North American Ambassador of the Venlil Republic and you are next*”  Still fucking surprised they let the Cubans in before us, maybe they got offered a better deal than what they have to offer to us?



I quickly try to recompose myself to not let the aliens see some sort of weakness in me, get some grip Jane for fucks sake, you're the ambassador of the United States to these aliens, this is probably the biggest point of my career and I do not want to fuck it up.



Claire just looked at me and said.



“*Bonne chance Jane*” I didn't understand her words, but I think I did understand what I meant.



“*Thank you*” Is all I can say as I quickly start to move, as I pass through a small hallway of offices I quickly see the person that was just before me, the Cuban ambassador looks emotionless, almost like a robot even.



Oh god did they mind-control that man, and force him to serve their evil alien empire, has the mask finally come off???



CALM THE FUCK DOWN JANE.



YOU ARE AN ADULT NOT A TWELVE-YEAR-OLD FOR FUCKS SAKE AND A AMBASSADOR KEEP THAT IN MIND.



I look back and see him smiling, whatever thing that left him emotionless is now gone.



I stop and breathe in and breathe out as the alien in front of me looks confused at me I think.



Look, remember they told you after you get changed for someone more experienced, you would get some long paid vacations by the Department of State. 



I just gotta keep things civil, try to extinguish any American fears, establish good relations, and try to make the best out of this situation we are in right now.



“*Are you ok human, you need something*?” the alien sheep tells me.



“*No, no it's alright I just had to catch my breath there for a second,*” I say as they flick their ears upwards, I've seen them do something like that before, is it something akin to nodding to us?



I should read the book more. I swear there was one in the lobby explaining what their tail and ear flicks meant.



The Sheep quickly stops in front of an office with the door office.



“*Jyvek is awaiting you ambassador,*” They say as they leave me alone, with the door slowly opening revealing a smaller white sheep, clothed in a black suit with a turquoise tie.



It seems so familiar yet so alien at the same time seeing them dress like this, as if I were meeting someone else from another country eager to meet me.



“*Come in Jane, I'm so sorry for leaving you this late, I know how important your nation is on Earth and all, you were supposed to come in earlier but due to some issues with the Cuban ambassador, we had to bring him first*” He quickly tells me as he gets back to his desk and with me sitting in front of him.



It is also so weird to see them talking English as if they were just another human, with this one, Juvek? Speaking with an almost recognizable New England accent, as if they were just another middle-aged guy from Boston or Maine.



“*Miss Jane, are you alright you seemed to zone out for a little bit*?” Jyvek tells me worriedly.



“*To be honest a bit stressed,*” I tell him honestly, dammit what did I just tell myself of showing no signs of weakness????



“*Ah don't worry Miss Jane I think we all share the same sentiment, i've been preparing myself for this day for quite some years as you call them here for this very meeting, so how about we share a nice cup of Vanis, it's the nearest thing I got to your people's tea, I heard stuff like this helps you relax, right*?” Jyvek said.



He then stood up and went to grab the handle of a carafe from a “coffee” look-alike machine, with whatever liquid was there being ready and hot already, as he poured it into two cups and gave one to me.



I then tried to smell it but nothing came, huh weird.



“*Oh yeah if you haven't noticed Jane, we don't really have a good sense of smell, so we don't base our products on the smell but please do try it, it's a great mix of several of our fruits into one steamy relaxing drink,*” He said as he started to drink and looked more relaxed. 



A sense of doubt creeps over me.

I mean there are a billion reasons why I shouldn't be drinking this right now, ranging from health concerns to conspiracy theories, for the sake of not looking like an ass, I decided to take a sip.



Nothing too extraordinary honestly whatever expectations I seemed to have turned out wrong as it just was bland for lack of a term like its almost non-existent smell.



Maybe the aliens taste the different types of fruits differently from us?  
  


Meh, I don't care but I still do have a small placebo effect in calming me down, hey at least it somewhat worked.



“*Thank you for the drink Ambassador Juvek,*” I said to him, trying to appear courteous as one could.



“*It's said Jy-vuk, but you got it almost right Jane, it's always nice to meet with a species that can talk without the need for translators,*” Jyvek told me.



“*Alright then, now let's go onto business, there are many reasons why we are here, Miss Jane, all of them which you probably have heard in our broadcast on earth long ago*” Who wouldn't remember the “transmission”.



On that day I felt my world turn upside down as aliens were now a thing and were coming to Earth.



And had the very bad idea of joining my family in binge-watching alien invasion movies as one of my uncles declared that he would fight till he died or he was unable to continue fighting against the alien invaders.



“*Yes, though your transmission said a lot of things, many of our people don't feel exactly reassured in your intentions of “peace”, since we don't know what to truly expect from you to be plain, and we want something more concrete to truly ease our people's fears*,” I explained to him.



“*No, no it's alright it's your first time meeting aliens of course there are many factors to consider I already know that you humans have a very “creative” imagination when it comes to your alien media, though do be reassured Jane there is nothing like Cthulhu out there,*” Jyvek says laughing at his own joke.



Jesus Christ, it's so weird to see an alien talk so fucking casually like another human this is causing a major culture shock within me, I know they are doing this to try to appear more relatable and more friendly but come on, not even their accent sounds alien its sounds just another human.



“*Not the greatest audience well alright then, if you're looking for any reassurances for your people we can start with one of the main subjects we would like to tackle with you which is environmentalism as you people call it,* 



*We heard of your disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that happened last year and currently have some “solutions” that can help lessen the effects of that spill in the long term, leasing its damage, and as well helping you combat “climate change” as you folks call it, helping you people temperature not go higher than 2°C and even in the best case scenario not get it close to that, preventing many of its long term effects*!”  Jyvek said as he passed me a small dossier



“*This is just barely the “top of the iceberg” of our plans to help you in regards to that problem*”



As I started skimming through it saw several plans for cleanups in the Gulf of Mexico, some plans for electrical plant facilities that produce renewable energy with very low emissions, possible infrastructure plans that would help lessen the carbon footprint of the average person, some railway plans funnily enough and other initiatives for research cooperation with their scientists and ours, some plans regarding agriculture sector, etc.



Though just the tip of the iceberg as they said this seemed honestly very comprehensive and if some people in Congress and Senate would see this they would probably become ardent supporters of this plan while others oppose it.



“*Though obviously we will only do this with the intent approval of your people's nation*”



“*I think this is something good that could start to quell some fears of my people, but what else would you people be interested in helping us with*?” Might as well ask here I guess.



“*We have many things to talk about here, there is a reason we don't have the Canadian ambassador or Mexican ambassador in the office right now since we are going to take a decent while Miss Jane, hopefully, the seating is comfortable, now let's get started*..”

This is all I've got so far. To anyone who follows a similar budget, is there anything I've missed off of my needs that I'd need to factor in? Is there anything specific inside of my wants besides the odd coffee that I've forgotten? Better yet, am I allocating too much money? Could I survive off two shifts a week instead of three?

1gqofm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mid_Century/comments/1gqofm0/anyone_ever_see_a_heywoodwakefield_lazy_susan/,Anyone ever see a Heywood-Wakefield Lazy Susan?,"Anyone ever see one of these?

What I have here is what appears to be a Heywood-Wakefield Lazy Susan.  I bought it from a local H-W specialist antique store where we've bought plenty of H-W from before so they thought we'd like it.  They said they has never seen one before and, like me, can't seem to find it in any catalog or documentation so they couldn't verify its authenticity.  Since it was unique, the right wood/color and not too expensive, we bought it.

The top is indicative of H-W what with the slats having mis-matched patterns and directions although what leads me to believe it's not authentic is the lack of balance you see in the top view with the left side being wider than the right with the two middle slats being offset.  So it looks like it's made up of parts rather than a cohesive design by H-W like you see in their classic lazy Susan coffee table (I have one.)

https://preview.redd.it/4c0ozhqilq0e1.jpg?width=701&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1089d6f840a4af352cf29baf151ed72490c64951

The bottom is similar to the top and has much more balanced slats.  The wood is definitely old and the underside of the top has a series of what look like nail holes (more like nail impressions since they don't go all the way through) regularly spaced about 1 inch from the outer diameter.  Have never seen that so am unsure what those might be.  But the rest of the wood has typical H-W striping and is still old and does not appear to be newly cut.  I've taken the pieces apart and all of them appear to be extremely well made and cut so it's not an amateur job at all which lead me to believe it could be a factory item.  The underside looks very similar to the undersides of my other very real H-W pieces.  (Felt pieces are mine since we have it on top of our large whalebone table.)

https://preview.redd.it/j37e0bd6mq0e1.jpg?width=701&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a82d4fd6e2e66b7db214971b091eb2337efec11

And it has a H-W logo burned into it though it's not complete and there's no indication of a model/series number on any of the pieces.  It makes me think it's a collection of wood pieces of actual H-W furniture put together in an homage with one piece having the logo but that's just a guess.

The bearing plates are definitely old as both the store and I have taken it apart to try and get it to spin more freely but the bearings and plates are quite patina'd and have seen a lot of use.  Another indication the conglomeration of parts and wood is old.  Hard to see in this view but the plate assembly is definitely vintage.

It was about a week after the Hurricane Helene devastation and I was standing in my ruined yard in front of my obviously destroyed home (still displaced for at least another month). This was shortly after the gas stations were just getting reopened and the ICE users were starting to feel like they could move about our town freely again. Maybe this gentleman thought it funny that not only was our house destroyed but we also our poor electric car to deal with...but I just laughed...here's why:

We actually have 3 bolts - while our house got smashed, the cars were amazingly all fine in the driveway. Not only that, we had all topped off knowing the weather ""might"" get bad. Once the stores began reopening, we were able to run our errands and move about town with very little hit to our range (a lot of stop and go and slow driving in the aftermath...our town got hit very hard). The beautiful thing is...just 2 miles down the road, across the river is the downtown area of our border state. It was fine, no big trees to do damage, no power loss AND there is a garage that belongs to our local university that has a whole wall of electric chargers - some Tesla and even more non-Tesla AND they turned off the fees for the garage parking so that charging was FREE. All they asked was that you move your car when it was done charging!!! 1 block away from the garage was the coffee shop with power and internet that we made our home base for the first 2 weeks of chaos. My daughters' ICE car had to be parked while our Bolts did the heavy lifting, with free ""fill ups"" whenever we needed it. The irony is that during that first week when the whole town was without power, we were able to breeze by the cars lined up at gas stations as they were waiting for the power to come back on so they could use the pumps - they literally parked and camped out so they could get gas just as soon as the pumps turned back on.

Maybe I am just super lucky to live in a town where most EVs are Teslas and the EV infrastructure is above average. There are plenty of Tesla specific chargers, but there is also plenty of non-Tesla charging available - the mall (free), the university parking garage (free with the cost of parking...$7 max). Also, our commutes are such that we generally are able to keep all 3 of our Bolts sufficiently charged with 1 level one charger. Maybe the guy in the truck wasn't trying to be a jerk, but with all we had been through with the house I was happy to be able to point out that our EVs had done better than most gas vehicles.

TL/DR - our 3 Chevy Bolts got us through a Hurricane disaster with free charging, no gas pump lines, and no worries about how we would stay mobile through this crisis (you should have seen the truck guys' face when I told him about the free charging)!! After this, I have no EV anxiety at all (range or otherwise)!

Context:

I (24M) was on the phone with my mom (“Margaret,” 46F) discussing life when we got onto the topic of a local college rivalry football game. I mentioned a TikTok video showing the referee’s controversial call that helped the rival team win. Before I even gave my opinion, she launched into a rant about how biased and unfair the call was. When she finished, I simply said I thought the call was valid.

Her response was explosive. She yelled that I didn’t know football, needed to “learn more,” and that I was banned from visiting her house. Then, she hung up. Our entire call lasted 8 minutes.

Over the next 30 minutes, while I cooled off, she bombarded me (and my fiancé, 20M) with angry texts, blocked my number, and unadded me on Facebook. When I tried to apologize later, I realized I was blocked. I felt blindsided and hurt over something so trivial.

The Incident with My Sister:

A couple of days later, I grabbed coffee with my sister (“Jenna,” 22F) at work. She vented about how the rival team’s fans treated her husband, who had worked parking enforcement at the game. I expressed sympathy but said the rival team still won fair and square.

Jenna snapped, accusing me of supporting the rival team and even bringing up traumatic experiences I had as a missionary connected to that school (which I won’t detail here). She also criticized me for being bi and called me “the world’s biggest @h0l3.”

When she was done, I reminded her I didn’t support any team and warned her I could report her to HR for her comments. She stormed off. Later, I apologized via Teams, but she ignored me. The next day, she refused to interact with me outside of work, and I told her that was fine, but I’d only engage professionally going forward.

Follow-Up with My Mom:

Three days later, my mom unblocked me and called after seeing my earlier apology. I thought this was an opportunity to move forward, but instead, she asked me to apologize again. She said I needed to be more “sensitive” because she hates losing and struggles as a “perfectionist.” She blamed me for “egging her on” and dismissed her own role in the fight.

Then, she shared a bizarre story about fighting with someone on Facebook who insulted her football team’s coach. She also mentioned that this same man allegedly locked her in a car years ago when she refused to give him something. I don’t know if the story is true.

Reflecting on this, I feel disgusted by how both my mom and sister refuse to take accountability or manage their emotions. Their behavior is exhausting and toxic. I’m also having second thoughts about reporting my sister to HR because of how bad her comments were. 

TL;DR:

I had two explosive interactions over a football game. My mom blew up at me for saying a referee’s call was valid, sent angry texts, blocked me, and later demanded I apologize because she’s a “perfectionist.” My sister accused me of supporting the rival team, berated me for being bi, and brought up traumatic past experiences in a hurtful way. Both refuse to take accountability, and I’m feeling repulsed by their toxic behavior. Thoughts?",1,1731533084.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

I (22f) had broken up with my bf (24m) (we were together for  three years) during a week-long road trip with friends (and I'm ngl I’m really starting to regret it). For some background info, the friend (23f) who went along with us was one of his college friends, and all three of us had hung out multiple times before this happened. But while in the planning stage, she explained that she wanted some company since her boyfriend (23m) didn’t want to be stuck in a small car with her for that long. It would be a trip from one coast to the other for dental school. Before things were set in stone, I let them know that I would be out of my comfort zone since it would be my first time doing a road trip without family (childish, I know), and to me, it seemed like they understood. Each person had their set section of an itinerary (I did the first section) and sat in the back of the packed car while they sat in the front. The first few days of the trip went well. The middle of it, however, was shaky. On the third day, we stopped by a cafe in the morning for some coffee and breakfast. His friend and I were having a good conversation while eating. Then, when we had split off to the bathroom (she and I went together while my ex waited in the car), my friend's ex had made it back to the car before I did, and when I was walking out, I could see they were talking. When I got to the car, it was silent. When I would try to ask a question or try to initiate conversation, it would just be a cold response from either one of them. Now fast forward to nighttime. After being ignored the whole day, they went out for drinks (and did not come back until 4am, which was not the agreed-upon time). I stayed in the motel room because I was tired and didn’t mind watching the bags yet again. I was so frustrated with how things had gone that day that I made the rash choice of calling and breaking up with him. I told him, “You no longer have a partner if you’re going to treat me like this when you’re with friends. Now repeat it back to me.” And he did. Now I get that I was harsh with how I did it, but when he and his friend came back, he made his friend wait in the hallway and told me that he thinks we should break up and that he isn’t going to change his mind because he ‘knew’ how he felt about breakups and was going to stand his ground. (Which has honestly never happened before about him standing his ground) but I cried, said ok, and we all went to bed. When I woke up, he first asked me, “Do you have the means to get home?” I started crying again because I was under the impression that we would all continue this trip together. Long story short, he ditched me at an airport in a random state where I didn’t know anybody. He had also known that I had never flown before, nor did I know how to navigate an airport. The car ride up there was just crickets  I had to call my sister for help, and she ensured I returned home safely. That night, I had gotten texts from both the friend and him asking if I had gotten home safely. In response, I just ignored them because I was under the impression that if you love someone, you won’t treat them like that. But a week later, he returned for his car (after I had moved my things out of the apartment we lived in together for two years back to my mom's). He didn’t say a word or look me in the eyes. He only spoke to my dog(whom we adopted together and a cute cat that I regretfully let him keep), grabbed his keys, and left. That was four months ago. His birthday was a few months after the breakup, and I wished him a happy birthday. However, when my birthday came up (a month after his) it was crickets. But now, it’s been almost 5 months of no contact, so I made the mistake of sending him a text that said this.

The only perfume I've ever finished is ""Si Passione"" by Armani but I've used and liked (not loved) lots of other things. I really enjoy CP's Fruit Loops for summer. 

Things I *Think* I Hate: anything grandma-adjacent, overt florals that turn powdery? I thought I loved Maison Louis Marie No. 13 Nouvelle Vague (Top note: Muguete, Coconut Waters, Lemon, Mid note: Tuscan Fig, Tonka, Agave, Base note: Vetiver, Amber, Santal) until someone told me I smelled like an old lady :( and then I was too sad to wear it. Now it just sits near my computer and smells pretty in the bottle. 

Possibly related: I did not enjoy these CocoaPink samples previously: Apricot Eyelet, Indian Donuts. The Un-Red smells so good in the bottle but I think it might be too...sexy for me? I don't think I project the vibe necessary to wear it. 

For this winter, I REALLY want to smell as close as possible to a peppermint marshmallow (sweet, mint, vaguely vanilla). I want to embody a peppermint vanilla latte sans coffee. I ordered HoG's Winter Divinity which initially smelled incredible (and still does in the bottle) but it immediately turned to soap on my wrist...sigh. 

Here's my tentative list of samples I'm looking to order from CP this winter: 

* Black Cherry Upside Down Cake

* Black Forest

* Black Marshmallow

* Black Vanilla

* Coeur de Vahine

* Cotton Candy Dreams

* Cranberry Noel

* Destroying Angel

* Earthstar

* Faded Memories

* Fear of Ghosts

* Fear of Spiders

* Genevieve

* Gooey Caramel

* Halloween in Dublin

* Heavenly Vanilla

* Marshmallow Candy Cane Noel

* Marshmallow Fireside

* Midnight Hag

* Nectarine Blossom & Honey

* Pink Bonfire 

* Peppermint Snow Angels

* Witchcraft

* Vintage Halloween

* Vanilla Bean Noel

* Spiritueuse Double Vanilla

I recently asked her if she wanted to go out somewhere maybe and we had a great time; took her out for some coffee and we just talked until the place closed.
We also live quite near so we pretty much see each other almost everyday and hangout a lot.
She smiles all the time when we're together and she laughs at the stupidest shit I say.

So what's the catch you may ask?

I've been depressed since I was 6 (it runs genetically in my family pretty much) and my brain is slowly steering me into screwing it all up.
My favorite thought it likes to serve me is that ""she doesn't really like me and hangs out with me because she's nice"".

But I'm used to thoughts like that, the main problem is (which will sound pathetic) I'm afraid to initiate any physical contact with her, and I'm talking about normal stuff like holding hands or gentle hugs. I've never been in such a situation, to fear doing something so trivial before and I just don't know what to do.

And no, I'm not looking for a girlfriend to cure my depression or some other nonsense, I'm mature enough to not think that having a girlfriend will miraculously fix my head, and don't worry I'm not and won't be trauma dumping on her.",1,1731532761.0,dating,1,1.0,False

I'm not saying you have to behave in a morally flawless manner. That's neither possible to do nor reasonable to expect. But there are countless incredibly easy things you can do to improve our collective lot.

Everyone can wear a mask to prevent the spread of covid and make themself less identifiable to the surveillance state. Everyone can call their representatives to demand change. Everyone can go to websites like freerice.com and give to others at no cost. Everyone who buys from Starbucks can cut back in favor of coffee shops that don't fund genocide. Everyone can write letters of support to political prisoners.

None of these actions on their own will stop fascism, but all of them are worthwhile. All of them count. No one can help everyone, but everyone can help someone. So do that. Help as much as you can.

It was particularly upsetting because he turned me down a lot in the first year, and didn't seem interested in me, with anything we did feeling forced. He got on medication which he claimed killed his libido. Then, after I lost weight and changed quite a lot, he started showing more interest. I doubted that his medication impacted his libido as much as he said. I started to suspect him of cheating after he became distant, started spending long periods of time in the bathroom, and was glued to his phone amongst other things. I caught him looking at porn, which he denied at first, but then said that he was doing to test himself. Then, I caught him staring at what was likely a teenagers behind, when he was struggling to perform with me. I only noticed it after he went silent on me mid conversation. I looked over, saw that he was staring at something, and followed his gaze landing on her behind. She had on juicy bottoms and a small crop top. He aknowledged that he was looking but said he wasn't checking he out, but rather that he was slightly judging her outfit choice, and was also worried because I said I wanted to dress that way and wear juicy bottoms. I don't recall ever saying that I did. In fact, after that happened I went and bought juicy bottoms to try and catch his attention. 

The next time it happened was again during a time he said he had no libido, and was also struggling with me when we tried anything. We were walking towards the escalators at the mall which were straight ahead. I was talking to him and he went silent, so I looked over, and he appeared to be fixated on something. I watched his eyes go up and down slowly, the typical movement of a guy eyeing someone up and down. I looked over and there was a group of women all in dresses, a few of which were tighter and shorter, and he seemed to be looking at the girl in one of the shortest and tightest ones. I confronted him, told him it was disrespectful to do that in front of me, and he denied that he had. He agreed that it would be very disrespectful. I thought the conversation was over but then he started to go on a rant, suggesting that I said he could never look, or never find another woman attractive because he's married. That he still has eyes and he's a man. He asked if, when he's not with me, he can't notice an attractive woman. He also denied that a glance was checking someone out, but rather that oggling is. He called me controlling and insecure. 

There were many other instances of this occuring. When we were checking out at a coffee shop one time, and he appeared to smirk and look a teenage cashier up and down, and then denied that. We were at the airport roughly a year ago and he went silent on me as usual. I looked over, noticed he was fixated on something, and followed his gaze landing on a woman's behind. He kept staring but insisted that he wasn't looking at her, that he was looking at her dog, but his eyes weren't aimed towards her dog. And since when does a dog make someone go quiet? This caused a big argument because I had gained weight, and he had put me down in many arguements over it, and the woman he appeared to be looking at was incredibly thin. I went on about how if he was going to check out other women in front of me, and also put me down over my weight, he should leave me. I mentioned a comment he made during one argument, telling me that guys prefer thinner women, which he said that he didn't mean. I said if that's him then leave me and be with a thinner woman. He started going on a rant about how it's only normal, and biological, to find thinness attractive. That no one is attracted to fat, and if they are it's a fetish. 

He brought up these plus sized juicy models I showed him prior to going on the trip, when I was comparing how my tracksuit looked on me versus them. He made it out that I was bothered by the fact he didn't find them attractive. When, what actually happened was, I was asking him if the outfit looked similar on me as it did them. He kept thinking I was comparing me body to theirs, and telling me that I was smaller, when I told him that's not what I was doing. When I said that one of them was wearing my size he said no way, that she was a lot bigger than me, and that he didn't find her attractive. That she couldn't be close to me in size because of that. I said maybe he's in denial about my size. I also said I found it uncessary that he should comment on whether he found her attractive or not, and that it was rude. I guess he got it in his head that I was upset he didn't find her attractive because of her weight, and he defended himself against that during the argument. When I asked why he was telling me what he was, did it apply to me, he said no and that he still considered me thin. That he was referring to super morbidly obese people. 

Fast forward and we are at the mall and a teenager in a crop top passes to our left, a direction we were not headed in, and he turns his head and looks at her. He says he's just looking around himself. Not long after that we are at another mall and there's a woman with a bbl in front of us that would be hard not to notice. I look over at him and he not only looks when she's in front of us, but keeps looking when she walks to the side of us. I call him out and he denies it, calls me crazy, but then admits to and says how could he not notice it. He said he wasn't checking her out, didn't find her attractive, and denied that he kept staring as she walked off. Then, yesterday, we were at Hollister and I was looking at clothes. I looked over and he was staring in a completely different direction. I asked what he was looking at and he said at clothes. I looked around the corner, and it was the registers, and there was young female employee standing there on her phone. He tried to tell me he wasn't staring that way, but another way, before going on about how I am controlling, and how it's not normal to ask someone where they're staring, and that he can look where he wants to. He denied he was looking at her, said he doesn't do that, but after I said she looked like a teenager he said she looked our age. 

He says he looks at everyone, men and women, and it's just something he does. However, more often than not, he looks at women and younger women at that. I've gone into stores with him only to notice him glance at every single woman in the store, unable to focus on me, or give me his full attention. He started saying it was me noticing attractive women, that I think he is looking because I'm insecure. When, 9 times out of 10, he goes silent on me and I look to see what's going on and catch him staring at a woman. It's crazy because whenever I do any of what he does back, he doesn't like it. He will go silent on me around others, both men and women, and says it's his anxiety. Then, when I've done the same around another guy, he asks me if I'm trying to look single. He asked the same when I walked ahead of him one time, but then he does that to me a lot. A month or two ago I looked at a guy to give him a taste of his own medicine, and I made it really obvious. He confronted me, and I denied it, but he kept going on until I said that I did it, and that I wasn't being serious. He insisted that I was being serious, that I was checking him out, and said that I was smirking even though I was wearing a mask.  ",2,1731532539.0,AITAH,13,1.0,False

1gqnq2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/redlighttherapy/comments/1gqnq2i/rlt_for_energy_focus_amazing_result_so_far/,RLT for energy focus. Amazing result so far.,"Hi everyone,

I finally got a RLT device about a month ago.  I bought a MitoPRO 300X. For years I have had a cheapo little flashlight device form Amazon for small aches and pains and it did work.  It was time to go to something bigger.  It is funny, as of yesterday I was going to post looking for advice as I have been using probably 4-5 times a week for 10 minutes sessions and have not noticed anything.  I leave it on the M1 setting which is 6 wavelengths and I sit shirtless with the device about foot from my torso/face.

Last night I lifted heavy at the gym and my left shoulder was sore so I laid down with my shoulder 6-12 inches away from the Mito for 10 minutes.  My face was picking up light as well.

The rest of the night I had amazing, calm energy and focus.  I am a musician and spend hours in the evening practicing and in the last year or so it has been harder to stay focused and energized.  I always need some coffee and I get tired earlier than I used to.  Last night after the RLT I felt so good.  I practiced for 3 hours straight and never got tired or lost focus.  I wasn't amped up - just calm and focused, yet alert.  The only issue was I didn't sleep that great.  I slept but I can tell it was lighter than normal.  I am thinking I have to continue this but don't want to interrupt sleep.

Has anyone experienced this and have suggestions?  I was thinking maybe 5 minutes of RLT instead of 10?  Maybe try different settings on the Mito?

Seriously, I was thinking of returning the Mito but if I can dial this in, it is a total game changer.  I have spent years trying to get that calm energy.  I am serious about health and exercise and have tried so many supplements and nootropics for focus and energy and can never find anything that truly works.

The windows in the kitchen do not have curtains or blinds.  



I’ve already turned every scene that I could into a night scene but there are 7 that have to take place in the day because the character is making/drinking coffee. 
Coffee is a non negotiable for these scenes, can’t take it out. 



Has anyone dealt with this before? Would it be believable if the windows are dark during the day? I mean maybe it implies that it’s dark out in the morning because daylight savings???",0,1731532302.0,cinematography,4,0.5,False

I recently got my hands on a 078s and have been absolutely loving it so far. However, when  doing my first cleaning of the burrs, I noticed that some of the coffee grounds had ended up in the lubricant. I was able to blow some of it off using the bellows but the rest is stuck in it.

1gqnmdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/school/comments/1gqnmdr/am_i_overreacting/,Am I overreacting?,"I have a band teacher who me and many other students agree is being borderline verbally abusive. He said that we better come to lessons in a threatening tone and said after a drummer dropped their sticks (for the first time and not even during a song) he was going to throw them in his firewood pile and like I think he meant the sticks but it kind of sounded like he meant the kid. He has said this before but in a different tone that was sort of funny. Today he was being really bad. It was so bad that one girl was shaking in her seat and another kid was sitting on the floor crying. Before this he made a bunch of people play one by one and when one girl couldn't do it he aggresively asked her what she had been doing since fourth grade (which is when my district started learning instruments) and she responded playing the trumpet? (which was kind of badass ngl) He also said that if you aren't going to play right (a.k.a perfect in his mind) you shouldn't play and don't come to the concert. (so basically don't play until not playing makes you magically better) He also said that our instruments (which many people had spent 100s if not 1000s of dollars on) wasn't good enough and we should ask for better ones for the winter holidays. He also says that walking on to the stage a MINUTE after the class starts is unacceptable even though the school is pretty big and kids don't have that much time in between classes and have to grab and put together their instrument; even though he says this I have had first period lessons where the lesson didn't started until five minutes until the period is over because he was drinking coffee and talking to his friends about sports. One time someone went out and asked if he was going to come in and said nah ur doing fine by yourself. Mind you this is an in-school elective which has no requirements to take. In my mind it's like a math teacher berating students for not remembering something from last year or not understanding a lesson and blaming them, saying it is their fault, instead of teaching them what they don't understand. He is really old and has tenure but some students are thinking about starting a petition and if that doesn't work not playing at the concert.

No prior symotoms to report. Ate a normal diet (no restrictions given) up until the day before procedure. I followed their instructions as given.

Prep Day was: 1 egg and piece of toast by 9 AM. Clear liquid diet started then. Dulcolax tablets at 2 PM followed by
7 day Miralax supply mixed with 28 oz cold lemon/lime Gatorade at 2 PM. It took over 3 hours for it all to kick in. 6 PM more Miralax mixed with cold Gatorade (tried orange this time). Continued going to the bathroom every 5 to 15 minutes until 2 AM. Slept for 3 hours. Had italian ice, coffee, chicken broth, jello, tea, apple juice, and Gingerale throughout the day. Had no trouble getting the Miralax down. Just sipped it with a straw  Woke up at 6 AM for the 3rd round of Miralax/Gatorade- back to lemon/lime- much less sweet and easier to drink. Stopped having to run to bathroom around 10 AM. Stopped all liquids by 8:15 AM.

Headed to my appointment at 12:45. Checked in and waited for them to call me back to my room. Nurse took my vitals and put in IV. He gave me some electrolytes too since I was feeling really thirsty and had a dry mouth. He eased my anxieties about the sedation- it would be my first time for that- and he assured me I was in good hands. The doc came in to introduce himself and ask me some questions.

I changed into my gown and the anesthesiologist wheeled me to the procedure room where a nurse verified my name, DOB, and procedure I was having done. They asked me to turn to my side and pull my knees up to ny chest which is exactly how I sleep so it was super comfy. The anesthesiologist started putting the propofol in my IV. I remember thinking it looked like milk. He said I was going to feel a tingling in my throat and that it would work fast. That's the last thing I remember before waking up in the recovery room. They immediately asked if I wanted my boyfriend and I said yes! I woke up feeling happy and groggy like I had a nice deep sleep. Stopped at Chick-Fil-A on the way home for a grilled chicken sandwich. No nausea or pain whatsoever. Would totally do it all again.

Just found one tiny polyp that they removed and sent off, and some diverticulosis.

Just wanted to share because I know I was nervous about going so long without real food, and the anesthesia, and both went smoothly!

i’m currently living in NYC, but my partner received a job opportunity in the South Bay - so we’ve decided to make the move. we’re considering living in SF proper, but depending on cost, commute, and apartments - we may live outside SF. 

some questions!

1. if we choose not to live in SF proper - do you have any recs for other areas that are lively and a bit walkable? Basically, our criteria is - we’d like to live next to a coffee shop and small grocery store we can walk to. 

we’ve read downtown mountain view may offer that!

2. for anyone who lives in SF proper - is the commute to South Bay really taxing in your opinion? my partner’s company has a shuttle service from the city. 

3. any advice you’d share with someone moving over? i am trying to be open-minded and not compare SF / bay area to NYC as i know they’re both great places that offer something different. i absolutely love new york, so it’s all a bit emotional - but i’m also excited for a new adventure!

I went in and got tested. everything was fine. they did tell me I have fatty liver and put me on medication(livolin-h hepatotonic).

I am trying to understand how this happened. I am assuming my diet has got something to do with it. I have a very weird diet and lifestyle.

About 6 months of the year I am back home and I cook and eat an animal diet. Typically 1lb steak, 1/2 ground beef or chicken per day. greek yogurt, raw honey, eggs, potatoes etc... no alcohol at all. tea everyday with raw honey, coffee occasionally.

The other half of the year I am in asia, I travel around and my diet is all over the place, usually adapting to the country im in. however I eat out everyday although I try to be healthy. I tend to consume more sugary drinks than normal(coffee usually and smoothies). and more white rice.

I also work out almost every day, weightlifting mostly and martial arts(mma/muaythai) and about an hr of running as well per week.

**What can I do to fix this? I am going back to my animal diet soon, which means usually less sugar and carbs, would this help? Am I consuming too much red meat as well? I usually try to hit 200+ grams of protein also. what should I do? Also to note, I am 29M - 6'1 220-235lbs usually. cheers**",2,1731530985.0,FattyLiverNAFLD,4,1.0,False

While I am officially normal weight, I have some very unpleasant fat deposits that don't go away, no matter how little I eat or how much I work out.   
  
I have for some time tried to reduce them by fasting. This has so far not had any real results. The last two weeks, I've not consumed anything except water and black coffee monday to friday. On the weekends I eat, but eat very little (2 slices of bread, 1/2 apple, 1 glass of juice). Even that felt way too much for trying to lose weight.

This week, I relapsed. While I had nothing on monday, I had a cup of tea and a slice of bread yesterday and a full meal (ca. 600 kcal) today. It feels like I'm an absolute failure.

btw: So far there have been no results beyond a few grams that I instantly regain, whenever I eat on the weekend.

Where can I go from here. How can I loose fat if I'm this weak?

1gqn1ll,https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/1gqn1ll/starter_planet_roast/,Starter Planet Roast,"Based on observation so far.

Gleba:
- You come overprepared to every situation. You showed up to your first date in a full suit. It was at an Applebee's. You had already studied all the material for your entire first year of college the summer beforehand. Your car has enough supplies packed into it for 2 weeks of off-grid survival in a hidden compartment. Parts of your house are fastidiously clean and organized, while others are full of literal piles of stuff.
- Your space platform before you got to Gleba was mostly cargo bays and walls. You didn't get there gracefully- You got there fast and with a shitload of supplies. After you got to Gleba, your space platforms all look like a ribbed dildos covered in landmines. It's the most efficient, after all.
- You have been cooking a big ass bowl of spaghetti on Nauvis. It is unreasonably productive for the amount of time you have spent on this run, and looks like it shouldn't function at all. You can launch 2 rockets a minute with it, sustained. Please lay off of the coffee and get some more sleep.
- You were addicted to at least one Factorio full conversion mod before Space Age and after you finish your third 30 hour Space Age run you will probably return to that full conversion playthrough, complaining that Space Age is too simple to keep you entertained.
- You have more playtime in Factorio than you do hours clocked at your actual engineering job. You consider your job to be good mental downtime for planning your next factory expansion.

Fulgora:
- You are ALSO speedrunning but with an... Uh... different approach. Why would you bother setting up big smelting arrays on Nauvis or lots of blue circuits production when you can just limp to Fulgora and get it all for free from space alien garbage? You'll have to rebuild it all anyways once you get Foundries and EM Plants. Your base can launch 2 rockets a minute for about 3 minutes, at which point your buffers dry up and the bottleneck of having 1 yellow belt of copper plates yanks you back to 2 rockets per hour. You would fix it... But again, what's the point when you have to rebuild everything later anyways?
- Your car is fucking filthy.
- You build tiny tiny space platforms and try to make them as efficient as possible. They regularly half-explode until the 4th or 5th iteration. Your space platform is constantly running out of cargo space, and you have yet to read the tooltip for the cargo bay. You are too busy hand-automating everything.
- Your base is an amalgamation of rails, belts and bots, used in the least efficient manner possible. You use belts to transport stuff long distances, trains to transport stuff short distances, and each requester chest is paired with a provider literally 1km away.
- The mech suit is the best part of the game, hands-down. You roleplay as the engineer as you build your factory in your head. Killing the biters is one of the best parts of the game and you are excited to commit more xenocide on Gleba and Vulcanus, but you need the right tools for the job first. You do not use Artillery or Spidertrons, at least not in automated fashion- You do it yourself because you actually find it fun for some reason. You cannot imagine playing the game without enemies and will probably try a Space Age Deathworld, if you aren't doing one already.

Vulcanus:
- You really like Vanilla Factorio's mechanics and just want more of that. You also aren't going fast- You don't care about when you finish the game, you just want to build cool factories and have a great time. Your Nauvis factory is large and well organized with some spaghetti and bot malls as a treat. It is a lot bigger than it needs to be for what it outputs but it has 2-16 trains and you love watching them snake around. You have no idea how many rockets per minute your base outputs, just that it is more than enough.
- You build slowly, not because you are dumb, but because it never gets old watching your 5000 construction bots manifest another GW of power or red belt of Blue Chips into existence. It may actually be faster for you to build WITHOUT bots because of how distracting they are.
- You build fucking massive space platforms. Your first space platform is over 500 tons and is either an enormous rectangle or shaped like the coolest ship from your favorite Sci-Fi universe. The asteroids tremble before the might of your artificial moon. You will feel no need to upgrade your platform to Fusion power because you already are hauling around 1GW of nuclear power.
- You don't really care about which planet is the BEST to go to first, you care about which one is COOLEST. You cast metal parts from lava and have to slay giant magma worms. You are metal as fuck and Vulcanus is too. Vulcanus is great for making lots of stuff, and you love making lots of stuff.
- You hate the idea of wasting resources and love the idea of productivity and resources reduction early in the game to minimize outpost building. Efficiency modules are underrated and the BMD was the best Space Age addition.
- You want to get the Foundry so you can big base on Nauvis or Gleba later. Or more likely here, on Vulcanus, because Vulcanus is the coolest.
- You hate cliffs and manually clearing enemy nests. You hold a genuine hatred for biters in your heart.

my partner (f in her 30s) is quite into sport and not much into sweets.

She stopped eating sugar „completely“ about a year ago. 
She doesn’t have a medical constitution, but just realized, that she‘s doing way better without the sugar. 
She also doesn’t restrict my eating.
For example, when we went to a fancy cake place I wanted to go to, she also ate cake, but was feeling a little nauseous afterwards.
So she‘s not completely strict-strict, as sometimes she enjoys honey or if I bake something, e.g..

Now to my dilemma: every weekend she makes coffee for us and does a „special blend“. When she made it before she used cocoa powder, but changed to dark chocolate shavings. 
It‘s really really nice, but I realized some days ago that she doesn’t know that there is sugar in them.

She eats her yogurt topped with them and is beaming with joy, when telling me „they don’t contain sugar“. 
They do, she just had the wrong column when checking them.

I really love seeing her happy and I researched before and the chocolate shavings without sugar are 1. expensive and 2. I‘m actually not able to eat them (due to intolerance). 
I also really support her otherwise, when cooking, baking, etc. I check twice as not to include any sugar. 
(I also realize on the other hand that she‘s mostly checking for Glucose and doesn’t care about fructose.)

So WIBTA if I don‘t tell her that there‘s sugar in her new found joy? 

EDIT: to fix typos

2. EDIT: Thanks guys. I think I just needed a nudge to make the right decision. I‘m at her place tomorrow and will talk to her. ",2,1731530553.0,AmItheAsshole,21,0.57,False

First and foremost, we'd like to thank everyone who has come and enjoyed the space so far. Our intention is to be at service to Olympia, and offer a fun and new non-competing addition to the already wonderful downtown. We also love, coffee, alcohol and food. But there are plenty of great restaurants and cafes who have put alot of care into what they provide, so we have decided to make our menu limited.

We're sure there has been alot of curiosity and questions regarding who, what, where and why. To prevent rumors from spreading and get everyone on the same page. Here we are.

GH is owned by a group of locals + born & raised Olympians, military veteran and have years of experience in the hospitality industry.

GH is the result of also being on the reddit platform for the last several years hearing what everyone is asking for. We are not a Co-Op or non profit. We are a small business or restaurant tea house, and we plan on creating jobs, giving back to the community, creating value and provide a place for everybody to meet, network and build connections that can be shared outside of the space. As people tend to gravitate towards people thier supose to meet. 

We hope to fill the role of where do people people go to meet new people? and a place to go when your alone to share in conversation. 

We specializes in a variety of Micro-brewed Exotics Teas, & all teas are supplements. Meaning we were mindful of our amount of  ingredients, but for an example the Capitol Lake Walk has Milk Thistle, and to much can loosen your bowels. We advise to alternate teas and speak with your health care provider about any questions. Not our TeaTenders. 

Our goal is to have the house teas consistent in flavor and always avaliable, bear with us as we have only been open 1 month and will have more available options down the road. We hope others members of the community can help with all inclusive events, paint a canvas or whatever people want to enjoy. We welcome everyone and   are currently open until 10pm every day and hope to have the space for people to enjoy from 10am to 10pm down the road. No dress code, there is a code conduct to be expected. Please be kind to everybody and make a friend. No drama. We hope to see similar atmospheres added to Olympia.


Happy hours & more events to be added down the road. We are family friendly, dog friendly, downtown Olympia food friendly. Just enjoy a $4 tea while enjoying free pool on the weekends or events.

1gqmtrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedSpouse/comments/1gqmtrx/how_to_handle_long_distance_and_transitioning_to/,How to handle long distance and transitioning to medical school ,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years but have known each other for almost four. He moved halfway across the country for medical school this June and I’m still in our home state and have no intention of going out there as I’m planning to enter my own graduate program next year. We’re both pretty independent people, and I don’t mind long distance. But, it’s been more difficult than I expected, and I’m wondering if this is normal for medical school. 

I’ve gone out to visit him three times with about two weeks in total and spent thousands of dollars visiting him and helping him move. I last went about a month and a half ago for a week and I’ll see him in ten days for Thanksgiving week. While I was there, I took off a whole week of work and took care of everything while I was there. I cleaned, cooked, bought more stuff for his apartment, meal prepped frozen meals for him, and did all his laundry. I’m a real acts of service person so it wasn’t a burden to me. HOWEVER he does nothing for me, which I understand because he’s busy and we’re apart. But while I was there if I told him I was hungry and wanted to go out to eat, he studied and ignored me until I was so hungry I was crying because it had been ten hours since we last ate (I need to eat or I’ll go crazy). When I’m back home, he doesn’t tell me anything. He doesn’t ask me about my day, it was a fight to even get him to tell me his schedule so I know when to not call or text him so he can study or go to class. I do think he’s super stressed from the transition and it’s negatively impacting his mental health and that medical school is NOT AT ALL what he thought it would be, but he doesn’t do anything for me or even communicate how he feels. He spends all of his time studying, going to class, or sleeping. And I mean he sleeps a lot. 8-10 hours at night plus a 2+ hour nap every day. I try to send him recipes and make grocery lists for him so feeding himself easier and encourage him to get outside and do things. When I know he’s really down bad I will DoorDash something for him or have a coffee ready for pickup by the medical school. But he doesn’t really talk to me, ask me about my day, carry a conversation, console or reassure me when I’m upset, or help me at all. I sent him my graduate school statement of purpose to take a look at and he didn’t even respond to it. I wish he would just send me $5 and tell me to get a coffee or let me be upset about whatever random thing in my life without getting more upset with me. 

I think that medical school and moving has made him extremely depressed, but I’m not a place to help him and he makes me feel bad about myself because even my attempts to help go unnoticed. I’m wondering if anyone has been in the same position while their partner transitioned to medical school life. ",1,1731530103.0,MedSpouse,1,0.67,False

I miss playing online games and streaming shows or movies with my friends but most of them are busy with relationships now or are taking classes IRL and are honestly too overwhelmed to hang out which is fair of them :,)

are there any clubs that are running things online that could be fun to join?

in case you're in a similar boat looking for friends, feel free to msg!

1gqmruu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gqmruu/in_your_experience_how_important_is_it_for_you/,"In your experience, how important is it for you and your partner to have common interests/share hobbies? ","I’ve seen all kinds of relationships in my life. And well obviously I’ve had a few of them myself. 

Sometimes you see two partners who are complete opposites in character. One of more energetic, outgoing, social, ambitions whereas another one can be calmer, geek-ish, reserved, and does indoor hobbies. 

I’m the latter. And well lately I’ve been thinking about what the ideal partner would look like. I’ve entered relationships before not thinking about this and ultimately it did not work out. But there were some positive experiences of course and lessons that came out of them. 

But I still have this looming question in my head as to whether or not common interests and hobbies are important. Like for me, when I think about being in a relationship, I’d like to find somebody who’s down to binge Kubrick or Scorsese or whatever films with me while we cuddle up, then play some Zelda or some shit afterwards. Go out to a library together or have some coffee when we go out. To summarize, I’d love to the cute geeky girl I can geek out with and have something to do with we both genuinely enjoy.

On the other hand. I’ve been with people I have nothing in common with and had complete opposite character, and the feeling would still turn out to be very intense. The most passionate relationship I had was with somebody who was very fiesta, aggressive, outgoing, extrovert, etc. 

But sometimes we did hit obstacles as to what we wanted to do when together. I wanted to lay back and watch a movie with her, she wanted to go to a bar. This relationship however ended shortly as we both had our toxic traits and well let’s just say I had to call it quits before we both ruined each other lives. So I never really did find out if we were going to make it work despite those obstacles. I suppose one could if they had an open mind and both decide to be open to doing each other hobbies/interests.

But I just wonder if it’s even worth it. Wouldn’t it just be easier to find someone you got chemistry with AND have similar interests? Or is it worth it being with somebody you really vibe with, even if you gotta do shit you don’t want to do?

What has your experience been like? Can polar opposite relationship work in the long run or will they eventually fall apart ?

Diaz melted more snow and made some instant soup, enriched with two fresh eggs. He said to them: ""Look, botijas, lunch will be ready soon.""
The boys were surprised to hear themselves called botijas an exclusively Uruguayan expression for ""boys"" —by a Chilean mountain climber. Lucero explained that his eldest daughter was married to a Uruguayan.
He had visited them in Uruguay.

""What a coincidencel"" one of the boys said.
""I'll tell you an even greater coincidence,"" Diaz said. ""In Santiago, I live on Uruguay Street. And not only that: my mother, who lives in another section of Santiago, also lives on a street called Uruguay.""
There was something more. While in Uru-guay, Diaz had bought a salt shaker that was peculiarly Uruguayan. He took it from his bag and showed it to the boys. They recognized it. Some had identical shakers at
home.
Later Diaz said: ""My purpose was to put. the boys at ease, make them feel at home.
Some of them were angry they had been left behind and would have to spend another night in the plane. Some were anxiety-ridden.
Besides, they had not seen an outsider for seventy days. I believed it was important to treat them as kindly as possible and make their re-entry into civilization as painless as possible. I wanted them to know they had a friend.""
Diaz poured the soup into two plastic glasses. The boys sipped and passed the glasses around. While they sipped, Diaz sliced some salami that his wife had given him. After that, Diaz melted more snow and gave them coffee.

""Delicious,"" a boy said. ""Really delicious.
And what fast service!""

The medical student Zerbino drew him aside. They walked toward the fuselage. Later Diaz said: ""It was then, for the first time, that I saw the cruel reality of survival. There were remains of human bodies all around the fuselage. I did not show surprise or express indignation. I believed that for the psychological sake of the boys, the less said, the less made of it, the better it would be for them.""

They went inside the fuselage. Diaz was sickened by the odor of old unwashed clothing and the pilot's body, which was still trapped in the cockpit. He did not want to see more just then. They returned to the group. There was one cigar left in the box.
Zerbino offered it to Diaz.

""I don't smoke,"" Diaz said, ""but I will keep it for a souvenir.”

1gqmmsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1gqmmsh/creeping_crimson/,Creeping Crimson ,"(I originally posted this story on r/nosleep years ago but despite being one of my favorites and even ending up on the podcast it never quite got there traction I hoped it would. I hope those who creep their cast might enjoy my old writing) 

The Hedges motel and motor lodge was the kind of tucked away place you don't find on purpose. It's not mentioned in any roadside guides or travel pamphlets, it doesn't advertise and it doesn't have a web page for booking - in fact if you blink as you make the turn around the bend where it's nestled you'll miss it all together. 



That said it's not at all an unpleasant looking place. A single story motel and restaurant built with the aesthetic of a log cabin. It sits nestled in a surrounding forest of sweet smelling redwood and pine and when mixed with the scent of rain - like when I went - it seems downright heavenly. The burnt orange of the tree bark surrounding the stained wood buildings stands out - even when darkened by the rain and dim light of dusk. Yet a sinister tone can be felt and glimpsed if you're looking hard enough. The red sign reading - VACANCY - casts its light on the surrounding area, giving the sap leaking from the redwoods the tone of blood seeping from open wounds. 



When my wife and I made the turn that brought that place into our view I was already road weary. We had plans to meet some friends of ours at a cabin; it was getting late and we'd already been on the road a long time with plenty of miles left to go. I should have kept driving, no matter the miles between me and sleep I should have just kept on down the winding road and on to my destination. My empty stomach and heavy eyes had other plans though and I pulled into its parking lot.



I wish I would have blinked. 



___________________________________________________


""Are you sure you want to get a room? I mean I could just take over driving while you get some sleep."" My wife Helen said. I answered her before I spoke by putting the car in park and shutting off the engine. 



""I'm exhausted, and hungry, and honestly I just want a real bed for the night."" I smiled and leaned back in my seat rubbing my hands over my face before continuing. ""Besides, it's getting dark and pouring rain. On these roads, I’d rather not chance it."" 



Helen sighed, ""I suppose you're right."" She looked out of her window and up towards the sky as if diagnosing the weather. ""I hope it clears up a bit by morning."" 



A quick flash of lightning filled the air and thunder rolled above our heads. 



""I think that's the weather gods saying no."" I smiled and grabbed my jacket from the backseat. ""I'll get us a room."" 



___________________________________________________


I shook the rain from my jacket and stepped into the lobby. A portly older man behind the counter looked up from his portable television to greet me with a cheery smile. He groaned as he got to his feet and composed himself by straightening his flannel shirt and running his fingers through his thin silver hair before speaking. 



""Good evening, young fella."" He dropped his hands to the counter and leaned forwards towards me as I approached. ""What can I do ya for?"" 



""Hey there, I'm gonna need a room for two for the night."" I smiled back and took in the decor. I fireplace burned in the other corner of the room and everything still had that log cabin charm inside. I could smell brewing coffee and that added to the warmth of the place. 



""Sign in here."" The old man plopped a huge register down on the counter and held a pen out towards me. The ledger was full of names but only two above mine had the same date.



""Busy night?"" I asked, half joking and hoping the jovial tone came across in my tired voice. 



""Couple others, a family with a couple of kids and them other fellas."" He looked past my shoulder like he was looking for someone as I leaned down to sign. ""T'ween you and me I think them other two might be a little light in the loafers, if ya catch my meaning."" He whispered and met my eyes with a slow nod. 



I chuckled, a bit caught off guard by his antiquated turn of phrase. He stood up straight, looked over my shoulder again and then limply flicked his wrist down as if too further explain.  His eyes flicked around the lobby as if he were going to be caught making his gesture and a hint of worry crept up behind the otherwise cheery face. 



""Yeah..."" I handed him back the pen as I finished writing my name. ""How's the coffee in your restaurant?"" 



""Better than what we got here in the lobby, I’ll tell you that much."" He grabbed the register and put it back under the front desk. He reached behind him and moved his hand along a row of keys before plucking one off and handing it to me. ""Room 1-C, enjoy your stay Mr...."" He paused to lean down beneath the front desk and read my name off the register. ""Mr. Gamble."" 



""Call me Tom."" I said taking the key from him and putting it in my coat pocket. ""Mr. Gamble never really suited me."" The old man laughed heartily at my statement as if he were in on some joke that went over my head. 



""Well Tom, if you need anything just call the front desk and ask for Otis."" He pointed a pudgy thumb at his chest with pride. I nodded and thanked him, as I headed back out into the rain I looked back only once and saw him returned to his seat and watching his little TV with a satisfied smile. 



___________________________________________________


After dropping our things off in the room my wife and went to the restaurant. It was little more than a dining counter being worked by one man who served as both waiter and cook but it would do. As we took our seats we saw the family Otis had mentioned a little further down the counter, the father - a man in his late 30's wearing a polo shirt and board shorts during a thunderstorm - nodded to me as we sat down. His daughter was running around with her arms outstretched making plane sounds as her parents focused on their cheeseburgers. 



""She's adorable."" Helen put her hand on my shoulder and looked over at the little girl with a smile. The girl noticed and became suddenly shy hiding behind her mother’s legs. Helen waved at her anyway and took a seat next to me as I looked over the laminated menu. 



""Sorry, she's shy!"" The girl’s mother chimed in with a soft voice, she too was in her late 30's and far more appropriately dressed for the weather in a heavy jacket and jeans. ""Say hi to the lady, Lydi beans."" 



""Lydi beans"" poked her head out briefly from behind her mother’s legs and waved before retreating. It was an act so adorable that even in my tired and half-starved state it made me smile. 



""Hi, sweetheart."" Helen said looking across me at the little girl before switching her attention back to the mother. ""How old is she?"" 



""Lydia is 6."" She looked down at her daughter as she spoke, the little girl stuck her head out again realizing that she was now the focus of the adult’s attention. 



""And a half!"" she chimed in. 



""...and a smart-elek, sit down and eat your grilled cheese Lydi beans."" Daddy board shorts chimed in. 



""How, you folks doing tonight?"" A gruff voice suddenly came from in front of us and I looked up to see a gaunt bearded man in a greasy apron now standing there as if by magic. ""What can I get you?"" 



""Coffee, and a burger is fine. Hun?"" I tapped Helen on the shoulder and she broke her gaze from the little girl long enough to react. 



""Oh, I’ll just have the same."" 



""You got it."" The cook shuffled back into the kitchen just as the family was finishing up their food. My wife and I said goodnight to them as they passed and they wished the some to us. The daughter Lydia turned around as she stepped out the door and waved goodbye to use before throwing on the hood of her jacket and extending her arms out like a plane wings once again as she ran into the rain with her parents. 



___________________________________________________


After dinner we headed back to the room. I took a nice long shower and Helen laid back on the bed clicking through the channels. When my shower was over and I was getting dressed I noticed that I could hear the family from the restaurant talking in the next room - pretty clearly too considering they were talking at normal volume. 



""Can you believe how thin these walls are?"" I said to Helen as I stepped out of the bathroom in a cloud of steam. 



""I know, right?"" Her eyes looked behind me noticing how fogged up the bathroom was. ""Jesus, did you take a shower or create a sauna?"" 



""There's no vent in there, no window either."" I tossed my towel and rummaged through my bag for my cigarettes and lighter. ""Guess were going to have to skip the sex tonight."" 



""What does a bathroom window have to do with that?"" She said with a confused laugh. 



""No, you goofball, because of the walls."" I found my cigarettes and Zippo finally and zipped my bag up. I turned towards my wife with a smile and held them up in offering.



""No, no, I don't feel like getting up."" She splayed out taking up as much of the bed as possible and closed her eyes. ""Hurry back though, sex is still on the table we just have to be really, really, deathly, quiet."" 



""Maybe they sleep with earplugs?"" I said. I heard my wife laugh as I stepped out beneath the overhang in front of the line of rooms and closed the door behind me. 



___________________________________________________



I sat in a chair by the ice machine and had my cigarette. The storm continued to pound down on the little roadside motel and the red light from the vacancy sign made it look like blood was falling from the sky. My attention was drawn to the other end of the walkway as someone stepped out of 1-A and started heading my direction. He nodded and raised one hand in a wave as he approached, in the other he had an ice bucket. 



""Hey there."" he smiled as he stepped past and opened the ice machine. 



""Hey, how ya doing tonight?"" I took another drag off my cigarette and blew it out into the streaks of red rain. 



""Pretty good."" He set down his filled ice bucket and looked at my cigarette with longing. ""Would you mind if I have one those?"" 



I reached my pack out to him and took one, I lit it for him and sucked in a deep drag with a look of long lost satisfaction. 



""My boyfriend is always on my case to quit, but nothing beats that after a long day."" 



""Amen."" I agreed. ""So are you here with your boyfriend?"" 



""Yup."" He took another drag and scratched his stubble. ""We were just talking about how paper thin these walls are."" 



""No shit!"" I agreed. ""My wife and I were just saying the same thing. Its nuts."" 



""Why do you think they stuck us all together like this? I mean we have to be the only 3 rooms booked. Why would they put us all right next to each other?"" 



""I dunno."" I twirled the cigarette in my hand while I thought. ""Maybe it's easier for the cleaning service. No one around here looked too spry.""



""Yeah, maybe..."" He trailed off clearly thinking deeper about it. ""My name is David by the way."" 



""I'm Tom."" I shook his hand and finished my cigarette. 



""Hey, I found a good movie playing."" I heard someone call from down the walkway. I looked to see a man peeking his head out of David's room. ""Did you get the ice? Wait...are you smoking."" 



""Busted."" I said with a laugh. 



""Yeah, I guess so."" David flicked his cigarette out into the storm and grabbed his ice bucket. ""Guess I better get back. Good to meet you Tom."" 



""You too."" I responded rising from my chair. David ran off to his room and I could hear his boyfriend on his case before he even reached the door. I went back to my room, more than ready to lay down and finally get some sleep. 



___________________________________________________


I hadn't been asleep an hour when I woke to the sound of a PA system kicking on with a screech. My wife and I both sat up in bed confused as hell as to what was happening, but before we could even get our bearings the chanting started. 



It droned out of some unseen speaker and filled the room. The words weren't English - in fact - they weren't any language I recognized. The voice speaking them was low and weighty drawing out each sound as it was made. 



""What the fuck is that?!"" I shouted getting out of bed and hunting around the room. I could hear the family next door waking up too. The voice echoed from their room as well and I realized Daddy board shorts was doing exactly what I was doing only with more expletives. 



I looked over at Helen who had already picked up the phone and had it to her ear. 



""Shit! There's no dial tone."" She slammed the receiver down and got out of bed rushing over to her purse while I continued to hunt for where the sound was coming from. It was reverberating around the room making it hard to track down, I went to flick on a light to help in the search but nothing happened. 



""Are you kidding me, the power is out too!"" I slid my jeans on and got ready to storm to the front desk to ask cheery Mr. Otis exactly what the fuck was going on. 



""No cellphone signal either."" Helen held her phone up to me as if I wouldn't believe her. I could hear Daddy board shorts next door slamming against something - an expletive following each hit. Further down I could hear David or his partner yelling something I couldn't make out. 



""Stay here, I’m going to find out what the fuck is going on."" I reached for the knob but it wouldn't turn. I shouldered against the door but it felt sealed shut. It was like slamming against a brick wall. 



""What are you doing?"" Helen came to my side watched me press pointlessly against the door. 



""It's locked, it's fucking locked."" I gave up and stepped away from the door frustrated, 



""What do you mean it's locked? How is it locked?"" Helen started to check for herself and I didn't bother to stop her. 



""I mean locked, from the outside or something. It won't fucking open!"" 



""Well, grab the key!"" 



""There is no keyhole on the inside of the door, Helen! I turned the lock and the deadbolt already, the thing isn't budging!"" I flipped over a chair even more frustrated. 



""You guys are locked in too?!"" I heard Daddy board shorts yell through the wall. ""What the hell is going on?"" 



""No idea!"" I yelled back. ""Are the guys on the other side of you locked in too?"" 



""Yeah."" He responded and I heard him move away from the wall. 



The chanting felt like it was boring its way into my skull, in a fit of anger I grabbed one of the chairs and threw it against the window as hard as I could. The chair simply bounced off and landed upside down next to the bed, so I picked it up and started slamming it against the window as hard as I could. I could hear my wife screaming at me but didn't care, I didn't like feeling trapped and it was driving me insane fast. I needed out of that room. 



On the fourth hit the chair shattered into pieces, and not a mark was left on the window. 



""It's bulletproof."" Helen walked over and touched the glass. ""It's bulletproof fucking glass, Tom. Why does a hotel room have bullet proof windows?"" 



I opened my mouth to say ""I don't know"" yet again but my response was cut short by the sound of someone screaming bloody murder. Not screaming in anger, or frustration like myself and Daddy board shorts had been, but someone screaming in pure agony. 


___________________________________________________



""What's going on?"" I shouted through the wall. I could hear the little girl Lydia crying on the other side and beyond her the sounds of screams and cries for help. 



""I don't know."" Said more sensible Mommy. ""Jesus, it sounds like someone is killing them in there. Teddy is trying to see from the window."" 



I figured Ted must be Daddy board shorts real name. I walked away from the wall and peeked out through the window, I did my best to crane my neck at an odd angle and see down the walkway but it just wasn't possible - all I saw was crimson rain. Suddenly the screams of pain stopped and only the sounds of the chant remained. 



""Oh god, I can hear one of them crying, he's saying - David's dead. Oh god, did someone die?"" Sensible mommy was talking to me through the wall. I could hear Ted talking to someone one further down the line, presumably David’s boyfriend. I sat on the bed and tried to listen as Helen pressed herself against the wall to hear better. 



""He says - the red came and got him. He's babbling, making no sense."" Helen said, I can just barely hear them. ""Jesus Tom, he's begging for someone to get him out."" 



""Shhhhh, honey. It’ll be fine just cover your ears. Okay?"" Sensible mommy was talking to little Lydia, I could see them cuddled together on the bed in mind’s eye, talking to a wall, confused and scared. 



Then the screams started again, even through the family’s room I could hear him loud and clear begging for help and scrambling around his room like a madman. I could hear things breaking as he desperately tried to get away from something in a locked room with no way out. The girl and her mom next door were crying, and so were Helen and I as we listened to the man's screams die out in pained gurgling as he begged for us to help him. 


___________________________________________________



The next few minutes were a mix of confusion, fear, and desperate attempts for escape. The chanting continued over the hidden PA system as Helen slammed her fists against the window shouting for help. I could hear Ted from next door doing the same thing, just kicking fruitlessly at an unyielding door. I sat on the bed staring at the floor, my thoughts swirling around and trying desperately to find a place to land. I'd never heard anything like the sound of those two men dying and my brain didn't seem capable of processing it. 



""I wonder what movie they watched."" I said just loud enough for Helen to hear. My thoughts had picked a strange place to land. Helen stopped her pounding on the window and came over to the bed.



""What?"" She knelt down in front of me. ""What the hell are you talking about?"" 



""I met one of them outside. His name was David, him and his boyfriend were gonna watch a movie."" I looked up from the floor and met her eyes. ""I wonder what the last movie they watched was."" 



""Tom..."" Helen, collected herself realizing she needed to help me get myself together. ""Tom, you need to snap out of it. I know what your brains doing right now, running in circles. I need you right now though, we have to find a way out of this fucking room."" 



Her words barely had time to sink in when we heard a new sound from next door. Ted and his wife suddenly started shouting through the wall to get our attention. 



""Something is coming through the wall!"" Ted shouted, I could hear the whole family talking and shouting. 



""What the hell is it?"" Helen got up from kneeling in front of me and ran over to our wall to hear well. ""What do you mean it's coming through the wall?"" 



""Jesus Christ, I dont' know."" Sensible mommy was crying as she yelled. I could hear her go back to comforting Lydia, telling her not to look at ""it.""



The sound of the Family's panic suddenly went wild, sobs were replaced by screams and shouts for help. Ted was telling his wife and daughter to get as far back from it as they could, I heard them bump along our shared wall as they attempted to move away. 



Helen lost it in that moment and looked down at me with wild tear filled eyes before grabbing the brass lamp off the nightstand and ripping the chord from the wall. She started using it like a hammer in an attempt to break a hole in the wall. 



""We have to help them."" Helen shouted at me. ""Tom, get the fuck up and help me, we have to do something to help them!!!"" 



I heard Ted scream in pain as whatever they were trying to avoid finally got to him. The sound of Lydia screaming for her father - as I could only assume she was watching him die - finally snapped me out of my trance and I grabbed one of the broken chair legs to help my wife smash a hole in the wall. 



We tore through the wallpaper, stucco and drywall with our make shift tools in a rhythm that made quick work of our side of the wall. Helen slammed the lamp against one of the cross beams and it bounced off nearly hitting me. Teds screams were suddenly cut off and Sensible mommy must have gone into pure protection mode. There was no more screaming or crying as she realized what we were trying to do and we heard her start smashing something against the wall on her side. The hole on our side might be just enough to squeeze Lyida, the crossbeams being the only thing that worried me. Suddenly a hole opened up on Sensible mommy's side too and their room came into view. 



Directly in front of us was the woman I'd seen in the restaurant, her face now pale and streaked with tears. She worked furiously to tear through the wall, like a trapped animal doing whatever it took to protect its young. Over her shoulder I saw something far more disturbing. 



There was a mass of red that looked almost like moss except it pulsed and breathed as it moved closer and closer to them, it had covered most of their room and I could tell they didn't have anywhere to go but through. Offshoots like vines shot out groping blindly and sticking to whatever they touched as it crept closer. The worst part was what was sticking out of the center of the crimson mass. 



It was Ted, his body half melted. His skin was mostly sloughed off and the crimson was crawling all over what meat there was left. His ruined body still reached for its family, a hand outstretched towards his wife as she desperately tried to escape. My eyes met hers, only for a second but it was enough to crush me inside. I worked just as furiously as she and Helen to make enough room to get them through, then I wanted to find a way out of that fucking room. 



I needed to find a way out of that fucking room. 



___________________________________________________



""Mommy, it's really close."" The terror apparent in Lydia's voice sent chills down my spine. There was no way we'd made enough of a hole to fit the mother through and it was dubious as to if Lydia would fit. Still we worked furiously, portions of the wall falling away and piling at our feet. Those damn support beams made the amount of space available for anyone to squeeze through minimal. 



""Okay..."" The Mother said, stopping her work suddenly. ""It's too close, please, please take my daughter. Get her out of here how ever you can."" 



""No!"" Helen screamed, still smashing her lamp against the wall. ""We are all getting out of here."" 



""It's too close, i need to help get Lydia through. If it gets me before I do we'll both die."" Her eyes were filled with tears as she lifted her daughter and told her to climb through the hole. The look of abject terror on her innocent face was enough send tears streaming from my eyes. Helen and I both reached through and took her hands. As Lydia tried her best to squeeze into the hole I could hear her mother speaking behind her. 



""Go honey, it's gonna be okay...it's gonna be..."" Her words turned into screams and Lydia followed suit. The girl was kicking and screaming as I heard her mother flailing wildly behind her and shouting. Lydia screamed for her mother as Helen and I worked together to try and pull her into our room. 



""It hurts, mommy, it hurts!"" She was stuck and yelling for her dying mom. It was too much to bare and I felt like my heart was going to beat out of my chest. 



""Pull Tom!"" Helen was screaming at me! 



""I'm fucking trying she's stuck!"" 



The mother’s screams turned into wet choking sounds and gurgles just like everyone who'd been caught before her, and the creeping crimson mass had nearly finished its meal. It would undoubtedly be looking for the next. 



""You're hurting me!!!!"" Lydia screamed. 



""It's okay honey, just a little more."" Helen tried to sound soothing but her voice was filled with panic. She wasn't moving, then suddenly something was pulling her in the other direction. 



Lydia was no longer screaming words, just screaming. In my head I remembered the first time I saw her pretending to fly around the restaurant. Her shyness, her sweet demeanor. Now here she was stuck in a wall screaming as something I could barely wrap my brain around pulled her towards it to be dissolved into a pile of soft bones. 



""Oh god Tom, she's going the other way. It's got her! It's fucking got her!"" 



""I know, just keep pulling!! Don't give up."" 



The growls of my wife and I's effort mixed with Lydia’s screams of pain. Suddenly the girl came free and we all fell backwards onto the floor. I looked up first and was shocked into silence by what I saw - made all the worse in the dim red light that shown through window. 



""You're going to be okay honey, you're going to be okay."" Helen hadn't looked up yet, and she hadn't noticed the girl was no longer crying or screaming. I tried to tell her, as she lay there with her arms wrapped around the little girl’s body but the words were stuck in my throat. 



When Helen finally sat up and opened her eyes she looked down and saw what had caused me to freeze in my spot on the floor in horror. 



Lydia's lower half was gone, and patches of crimson tendrils were stuck to what was left. Helen's screams and tears came far more freely than my own. 

___________________________________________________


We both staggered against the far wall as the tendrils consumed what was left of Lydia's body; I turned away, unable to watch what was happening. My mind tried to focus on something else other than the sound of her body dissolving less than 2 feet away from me. I scanned the room for anything that could help us get out, anything at all. The chanting was making it hard to focus, it felt with each loop it got just a tiny bit louder and at this point it was like being at a shitty rock concert.



""It's coming through the wall!"" Helen gripped my shoulder and twisted me to see the slime pouring through the hole we'd made and the vine like tendrils reaching through and sticking to the wall with and audible ""thwack."" I returned to scanning the room and as soon as my eyes landed on Helen's hairspray I felt a click in my brain. I hunted around in my pockets for my cigarette lighter and once I felt it in my palm I grabbed Helen by the wrist and drug her with me to grab the spray can. 



""I hope this works like in the fucking movies."" My palms were sweaty as I pulled the lighter from my pocket and when I flicked it I thought it was going to fly out of my hand. It took two tries for the spark to become a flame but once it was there I aimed the hairspray can behind it and walked towards the spreading mass of red hell. 



I pressed down and the stream of hairspray caught the flame sending a jet of fire forward, but the range was short and it didn't touch any of the thing that was starting to cover the whole wall between us and our former neighbors. I started to walk closer and Helen - who'd been gripping my arm like a vise - suddenly let go and started rummaging through my bag. 



I got within range of the thing and tried again to douse it in flame, this attempt was more successful. I watched as the fire licked against the wall burning away the wallpaper and searing the spreading red mass to a charred black. In the dim orange glow of my makeshift flame thrower a small smile must have crossed my face as my heart filled with a feeling of justice no matter how small. It was quickly replaced with fear as the thing made a sound...



...It screamed. Not like a human being would scream mind you. It was more ethereal, it echoed what sounded like a thousand voices through the walls and made it seem like it was all around us. It even drowned out the horrid chanting. I nearly dropped my makeshift weapon to cover my ears but managed to endure, Helen on the other hand stopped her search and clapped her hands over her ears to protect them from the hideous noise. 



""Keep going!"" She screamed. ""Get closer to the door."" I watched her take her hands off her ears and grit her teeth as she returned to tearing through my luggage looking for something. I looked back to see the wall in flames, but he tendrils still spread out, they had started to cover the floor in that disgusting pulsing moss. I pressed down the aerosol can again and started to cover as much of it as I could in fire, the screaming sound continued and Helen and I did our best to press through it. 



I had to step over what was left of Lydia to get to the other side and next to the door. I pointed the flame down and burned the now gorging mass of tendrils and moss that had covered her. I apologized under my breath as I backed up closer to the door. Helen suddenly raised her hand up and in it I saw a yellow canister of lighter fluid, the stuff I used to refill my Zippo. She ran over to me and started squirting the flames on the bed and wall, the burned brighter for a few seconds as the room started to fill with a horrid stench. I then realized we were stuck in a burning room as my eyes started to sting from the smoke that rose up all around us. 



""The door!"" Helen shouted as if trying to explain how we were going to get out. She sprayed the door down with lighter fluid, as much as was left in the canister. I caught on to her lead and turned towards the door with my makeshift flamethrower and set it ablaze. The lighter fluid helped the wood catch quick as Helen ran to the bathroom and started soaking towels in water. I looked over at her while she worked, her mind going a mile a minute in survival mode. I mouthed the words ""I love you"" and saw her make a brief terrified smile before she mouthed them back. 



A tendril flew from the flames and landed against my leg before Helen finished with what she was doing. My leg erupted in pain as soon as it touched me, and I screamed my lungs out before turning my flame thrower on the grasping thing. I burnt my own leg as I torched it free, but the feeling of the fire was nothing compared to the way the crimson set my nerves alight. I could smell my own flesh burning and it was preferable to being taken by that thing. A few more tendrils groped blindly for me, landing with audible smacks against the dresser and the window. 



Helen dodged them as she ran back towards me with two wet towels in her arms. She threw one over me and then leaned down and kissed me. 



""Bust through that fucking door, Tom."" 



___________________________________________________



The things screams felt like they were going to make my ears bleed as I stared at the burning hotel room door like a rival. I pulled the soaking wet towel around me and crossed it over my face like I was doing an impression of classic Dracula. I could feel Helen behind me, wrapped in a towel of her own and ready to follow me through the hole I was hopefully going to make. I looked back towards the shared wall and it was covered in a mixture of the crimson mass and flames that now licked up towards the ceiling. The fire was spreading fast and we had no choice but to try and bust through the door, if the crimson didn't consume us the fire would and either was only moments away. 



I got into a runners stance and took one last look back at Helen whose face held a stern yet encouraging look - as if to say ""You can do this"" and ""You better fucking do this"" at the same time. I lowered my head trying to get it clear of the smoke and took a deep breath, the air was hot and stunk like boiling blood. I let the burning breath out and charged forward putting all my weight into my shoulder. 



I lowered my head as I struck the flaming door and felt it splinter apart despite more resistance than I was hoping. I went spilling through the hole in a dive and rolled off the walkway out into the rain. I threw the towel off and scrambled back towards the door as I tried to stand, my hands were outstretched for Helen as I saw her make a rush towards the hole I’d made. 



She leapt through the fire with her head down much like I had but suddenly fell flat on the surface of the walkway. I heard her crash down hard, it looked as if she'd been drug down mid jump. I ran over to her and as I reached down to help her up I saw the red tendrils embedded into her leg. More fired out from the hole in the door and just beyond it I could see a great flaming mass rise up and take ownership of the scream that had been permeating throughout the hotel. Helen tried to get to her feet but the thing started dragging her backwards, she wrapped her arms around me tight and I did the same to her refusing to let go. 



""The sacrifice must be completed!"" I heard someone yell from the direction of the lobby. I quickly looked to see chubby hotel manager Otis waddling towards us with a knife in his hand. The sight would have been almost humorous under any other circumstance but as he got closer I realized I couldn't hold Helen and fend off that fat little monster at the same time. 



Everything that happened next happened too fast for me to even do anything in reaction. 



""Look what you've done to my motel!!!"" Otis screamed as he lunged forward with the blade. Helen looked me in the eyes for one brief moment and I knew what she was going to do, god help me I knew. She released her grip on me and I tried my best to hold on, I was dragged a few inches across the rain slick wood walkway as the crimson pulled her back towards the room. I felt the knife come down and strike my arm causing me to recoil in pain and lose my grip, as I fell backwards off the walkway from momentum. Helen quickly grabbed the fat little monster by the collar and as I tried to run back over to them. I was too late though, as the crimson pulled Helen's legs with one quick motion and Helen held firm to Otis's collar. I reached out for her as I watched them both vanish into the flames of the room. I could hear Otis screaming in sheer and absolute pain as the thing devoured him or the fire burned him. I'm not sure which. My wife on the other hand, my strong wife, my beautiful Helen, didn't scream. 



The creature howled in either triumph or pain as the room started to collapse down around it. I sat under the red neon light of the no vacancy sign, the no very clearly lit up to keep people away from here while Otis was performing his sacrifice. The chanting still playing through the unburnt speakers in the other rooms slowly winding down as the rain pelted my skin. The fire spread quickly through the hotel as I watched. 



I stood in the rain for hours and watched it burn to the ground.

He is all i have,"So me (25F) and my boyfriend (28M) have been together for 4 years. I moved with him to his hometown a year ago and he bought a house that we made our home. I dont really have a relationship with my family, since i come from an abusive home, but i do have my sisters. They live 4 hours away from us. Last weekend, my boyfriend went to out with his friends, while was at the one girlfriend that i have here so far. Thinking back i always kind of thought that when something horrible happens conserning someone you love, you can feel it in your body somehow.. but no.. that night i slept like a baby at my friends house, and on my way home the next morning i stopped to buy us iced coffees and have a nice breakfast with my boyfriend. The second i saw him i instantly knew he was upset. He looked horrible, and i asked if anything is okay. He said «its not» and my first instict was to ask if his mom was okay, and then when he said yes i just rambled on naming different family members of his asking if they are okay. Until i stopped asking because of his body language. He was ashamed and wouldnt meet my eyes and i knew. Then he told me he has cheated. I was in shock. I kept completely calm (probably only bc of shock) and started asking questions. First of all why: he had no ide. He said he was as shocked as i am. Then i asked if he has wanted to end things but didnt know how to tell me, again no, he still loved me and want to spend his life with me. Honestly i kind of felt sorry for him, i have never seen him like this, he looked destroyed. I left after awhile saying i needed some time. I have been staying with my friend since (since i have school in this city). This happened one and a half weeks ago now. 

Since i didnt get any answers from him as to why, i ended up asked her name and contacting her. She didnt know, and i asked her what her take on the situation was. She said he initiated everything. He came up to her etc (i cant stomach going in to more detail right now). And it was also his idea to go back to OUR PLACE(?!). In the cab he changed his mind last minute and they went to hers. And yeah.. fucked. 

After reading that i felt done with his ass. I sent screenshots to him of what her perspective was i and he tried calling me again and again until i texted him im cant talk. He wrote a lot of messages saying he is baffled at these text and says he must have had a fucking anuerism or something. I stopped talking to him at that point.

Now, im realizing i am so totally fucked. He was the only thing that has ever felt like family to me, he is also my best friend in the whole world, and his house was the first home that ever felt like mine and safe. I am closer to his family than i am my own, and im fucking spiraling so hard. I cant lose this, i just cant. But i cant forgive cheating either, also how can i ever trust him again? He did tell me right away, but still. I am so stuck between a rock and a hard place. I have no one, nothing without him. He is the first person i have ever loved since my mom left me when i was 10, and i spent the first two years of our relationship just letting my guard down and learning to trust him. I refuse to go through that again with someone new. Its only him for me. And it breaks my heart. 

The way i see it i have two options; never see him again and accept that ill never love someone  as much as him and always look back,  thinking about him until im 90 years old, or going back to him and deal with the most horrible betrayal since childhood. I know everyone says they thought they’d never get over someone and they did, but i feel like this is different circumstances since i guess i trauma bonded with him, and maybe what happened is a little bit my fault too, since i put so much pressure on him to be my everything.. and again, his family is my family. His house is the only place that has ever felt like home. I am in total crisis",6,1731529603.0,relationship_advice,21,0.81,False

In a case of economy, almost all TV News/Hosts keep telling the same story in the past few years that how strong the US economy is, how many jobs has created lately, or inflation is low.....

The reality is everything is 1.5X, if not 2X more expensive comparing with 2020. Eggs, milk, breads, a coffee, a burger at cafe.....

a dozen of eggs from $2 --> $4

Black Coffee from Starbucks many years ago $1, now $2 even $3

a causal lunch in a big city could cost your $25-$30 (used to be $15-$20)

With all these, our paycheck mostly stay the same for many. 

The fact is salary is about 25% to 50% up from a few years ago for most working class or middle class, however, everything is 50% to 100% more, not to mention housing or rent.

Me (30F) kind of rekindled relationship with ex (31M) a couple of months ago. We ended things last summer 2023 after nearly a year. He's German and sometimes his verbal communication can be harsh and also his delivery isn't exactly the best. But he has some other great qualities, plans everything to the T so I don't have to worry about it, pays for everything, let's me know about his whereabouts and he's very handsome man although balding a bit. I honestly didn't know how to handle him at that time since he had some deaths in his family and he shut me down. I went three times to meet him and gave him the support I could, but he was still processing those feelings and even the smallest thing I did bothered him and he got verbally combative, I got very upset and instead of communicating I started packing my things up(big mistake) and he broke things off. I cried a lot and he was very upset too for shutting me down, he sent my stuff through post too. We didn't talk for nearly a year. 

I go to Vienna( where he lives) often for work and for interviews and started seeing my stories and started asking me why I'm there, I kept things casual and one day he insisted to meet me even for a few minutes if I could manage only even a coffee. I agreed but I moved to Germany at that time already but we kept in touch, he sent me pictures of his family that things had cooled down abit. 

I had to go to Budapest meanwhile where I lived before for some paperwork and said I'll pass by vienna, he offered his place for me to freshen up from travel and everything, when we met after our breakup it was sweet, he kissed my forehead multiple times and gave me the keys to his apartment and told me in German that he's happy that I'm there. When I finished my sightseeing, he came home cooked for me and I ended up staying over. 

We still kept in touch, he let's me know about his whereabouts always, send me pictures of his friends even when he's with his friends on their stag do, when he's with his dad, cooking w his mom all those things. I ended up visiting vienna again cz I had an interview there, I stayed at his apartment but the old wounds kind of opened up, he has a very bad delivery as told before and it ended up hurting me, with him saying that sometimes I expect him to do everything for me and that i struggle with basic tasks to the point where he said in the future when we have kids it would be a challenge with how i operate things, when in reality I was adjusting to his space, after listening to him complain I physically shut down after that and didn't let him touch me, I also told him that he lacks empathy and he would be a good boss but I would not have him as my partner which hurt him I guess. He didn't apologize but I was crying at night and he thought I slept so he pulled me close, kissed me, wiped my tears and pulled the covers over for me. He really struggles with verbal communication and can only show through actions while I physically block when I get upset. 

The next day morning I was still very sad with all that happened, I made breakfast and he asked me if I would stay over and try to cheer me up with some king julian memes which I love but I didn't react, when all I wanted to was just to hold him. He came downstairs to drop me off and he told me that we don't have to go through the pain and end things and wished me for my work in Vienna. I said vienna is not for me and I wouldn't want to be here( I regret that too :( but everything was just too raw) and left. I had time process everything that happened. Although what he said hurt me, he has so many other good qualities. He's actually a great guy but just struggles with intimacy generally. He still hasnt deleted my number, has kept my things still unlike last time when he sent them back and actively views my social media. I do want to give this a chance but I feel like he's at wrong here and wanted him to apologize but I ended up clearing the interview too and I might have a next round in vienna soon. 

My question is should I reach out to clear out the air when I go to his city for the interview again? Is there a future here? 

I'm sorry for the super long post, just wanted to get it off my chest :)

So today is the first full day of eating after the first shot. Oatmeal & egg whites for breakfast & coffee... totally fine. Hungry for lunch, had the green goddess w/ grilled chicken salad from Panera... can't tell if my tummy is just rumbly/burp-y or if I have to throw up now lol.

  
I have always been overweight/obese, since I was a kid. Except for the time I did the ""Atkins"" diet as a senior in high school (which honestly was disordered eating... or not eating, rather) and lost 50lbs, going from 195 to 145. Along with the weight, I lost every ounce of muscle I had. I worked as a lifeguard at the Y at the time, and I remember going to lift weights for the first time and could barely lift the bar. Then when I left the gym, I could barely lift my arms to fix my hair or set my hands on the steering wheel. No bueno. 

I slowly gained that all back over the years, gained 50lbs with a pregnancy (230lbs) and lost it all (thanks breastfeeding!), but maintained a weight around \~200lbs for a long time. Over the last 10 years I have slowly but surely gained \~70lbs, most of which piled on in the last 4 years. It's been so frustrating, all my labs are normal, my habits hadn't changed, but the weight kept increasing. I tried Metformin first (explosive diarrhea, no thank you ever again), but it did nothing. Tried WW several times, had success once or twice and would lose 20-30lbs and then regain it all, and the last time I tried WW, I lost nothing. 

Fast forward to April 2024, my dr. prescribes me Naltrexone to take in conjunction with the Wellbutrin I already take (aka Contrave). It was amazing how the new rx completely shut down all the ""food noise"", which has helped a lot, mentally. I have effectively quit drinking alcohol, which is pretty cool. I'll still drink occasionally, but when I do I feel absolutely horrid the next day (or days), so I mostly avoid it. I don't feel a want for it anyway. So here we are last week, and I complained to my dr. that the Contrave isn't really working, and so she prescribed the 2.5ml Zepbound injection, the first of which I took yesterday! Stuck right in my belly fat :-D I'm feeling really hopeful that this med will do the trick and really get the ball rolling on significant weight loss. 

SW before starting Contrave back in April: 271  
CW: 261 on Tuesday 11/12/24 before first injection of Zepbound

I had to go to Budapest meanwhile where I lived before for some paperwork and said I'll pass by vienna, he offered his place for me to freshen up from travel and everything, when we met after our breakup it was sweet, he kissed my forehead multiple times and gave me the keys to his apartment and told me in German that he's happy that I'm there. When I finished my sightseeing, he came home cooked for me and I ended up staying over. 

We still kept in touch, he let's me know about his whereabouts always, send me pictures of his friends even when he's with his friends on their stag do, when he's with his dad, cooking w his mom all those things. I ended up visiting vienna again cz I had an interview there, I stayed at his apartment but the old wounds kind of opened up, he has a very bad delivery as told before and it ended up hurting me, with him saying that sometimes I expect him to do everything for me and that i struggle with basic tasks to the point where he said in the future when we have kids it would be a challenge with how i operate things, when in reality I was adjusting to his space, after listening to him complain I physically shut down after that and didn't let him touch me, I also told him that he lacks empathy and he would be a good boss but I would not have him as my partner which hurt him I guess. He didn't apologize but I was crying at night and he thought I slept so he pulled me close, kissed me, wiped my tears and pulled the covers over for me. He really struggles with verbal communication and can only show through actions while I physically block when I get upset. 

The next day morning I was still very sad with all that happened, I made breakfast and he asked me if I would stay over and try to cheer me up with some king julian memes which I love but I didn't react, when all I wanted to was just to hold him. He came downstairs to drop me off and he told me that we don't have to go through the pain and end things and wished me for my work in Vienna. I said vienna is not for me and I wouldn't want to be here( I regret that too :( but everything was just too raw) and left. I had time process everything that happened. Although what he said hurt me, he has so many other good qualities. He's actually a great guy but just struggles with intimacy generally. He still hasnt deleted my number, has kept my things still unlike last time when he sent them back and actively views my social media. I do want to give this a chance but I feel like he's at wrong here and wanted him to apologize but I ended up clearing the interview too and I might have a next round in vienna soon. 

My question is should I reach out to clear out the air when I go to his city for the interview again? Is there a future here? 

I'm sorry for the super long post, just wanted to get it off my chest :)

We ended things last summer 2023 after nearly a year. He's German and sometimes his verbal communication can be harsh and also his delivery isn't exactly the best. But he has some other great qualities, plans everything to the T so I don't have to worry about it, pays for everything, let's me know about his whereabouts and he's very handsome man although balding a bit. I honestly didn't know how to handle him at that time since he had some deaths in his family and he shut me down. I went three times to meet him and gave him the support I could, but he was still processing those feelings and even the smallest thing I did bothered him and he got verbally combative, I got very upset and instead of communicating I started packing my things up(big mistake) and he broke things off. I cried a lot and he was very upset too for shutting me down, he sent my stuff through post too. We didn't talk for nearly a year.

1gqmdvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1gqmdvv/in_your_experience_how_important_is_it_for_you/,"In your experience, how important is it for you and your partner to have common interests/share hobbies? ","I’ve seen all kinds of relationships in my life. And well obviously I’ve had a few of them myself. 

Sometimes you see two partners who are complete opposites in character. One of more energetic, outgoing, social, ambitions whereas another one can be calmer, geek-ish, reserved, and does indoor hobbies. 

I’m the latter. And well lately I’ve been thinking about what the ideal partner would look like. I’ve entered relationships before not thinking about this and ultimately it did not work out. But there were some positive experiences of course and lessons that came out of them. 

But I still have this looming question in my head as to whether or not common interests and hobbies are important. Like for me, when I think about being in a relationship, I’d like to find somebody who’s down to binge Kubrick or Scorsese or whatever films with me while we cuddle up, then play some Zelda or some shit afterwards. Go out to a library together or have some coffee when we go out. To summarize, I’d love to the cute geeky girl I can geek out with and have something to do with we both genuinely enjoy.

On the other hand. I’ve been with people I have nothing in common with and had complete opposite character, and the feeling would still turn out to be very intense. The most passionate relationship I had was with somebody who was very fiesta, aggressive, outgoing, extrovert, etc. 

But sometimes we did hit obstacles as to what we wanted to do when together. I wanted to lay back and watch a movie with her, she wanted to go to a bar. This relationship however ended shortly as we both had our toxic traits and well let’s just say I had to call it quits before we both ruined each other lives. So I never really did find out if we were going to make it work despite those obstacles. I suppose one could if they had an open mind and both decide to be open to doing each other hobbies/interests.

But I just wonder if it’s even worth it. Wouldn’t it just be easier to find someone you got chemistry with AND have similar interests? Or is it worth it being with somebody you really vibe with, even if you gotta do shit you don’t want to do?

What has your experience been like? Can polar opposite relationship work in the long run or will they eventually fall apart ?

1gqmc1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/1gqmc1f/on_neurodiversity_impulse_spending_and_things/,"On neurodiversity, impulse spending, and things being ""just the way you are."" (Long Post!)","Edited to add: Going to add a TL;DR that I don't think will really be helpful but as people are already being petty about post-length, here you go--

""If you're neurodiverse and struggle with impulse spending, you likely do not understand how your own dopamine feedback loop works. By learning more about how your brain processes dopamine and desire, you can train yourself to make better choices. This is not impossible to do, and to say otherwise is a disservice to everyone else in the ADHD, AuDHD, or Autism communities because none of us are actually *incapable* of making changes. To throw in the towel on self-improvement is a choice, not an inevitability""

**And now, on to the post -- which, yes, is long.** 

Hey, folks.

I (35F) am a YNAB-er who has a dual diagnosis of ADHD and also Level 1 Autism (aka, ""mild,"" which implies a much more exciting ""spicy"" Autism is out there somewhere and I'm intrigued).

Often, I notice commenters here and in other budget/YNAB spaces cite a real difficulty with impulse control preventing them from managing their finances better. A significant percentage of the time, I also see people like neurodiversity (specifically ADHD) to the same challenge. I wanted to make a post dispelling some of the myths surrounding these neurotypes and the notion of whether or not they're insurmountable with regard to budgeting. I also want folks who are NOT diagnosed with either of these things but who struggle with impulse control to benefit!

I'd also like to make clear that not all people experience neurodiversity the same ways; I ALSO want to make clear that I am not diagnosing anyone; I ALSO ALSO want to make clear that you can exhibit these traits without a formal ADHD or Autism diagnosis (but more on this last one later...).

I want to organize this post the following way:

1. Symptoms of a neurodiverse or scattered YNAB-er
2. Root causes of behavior
3. Possible adjustments or remedies

**You Might Be A Neurodiverse YNAB-er If...**

* You're regularly continuing to impulse spend and cannot seem to help yourself.
* You get really overwhelmed with things like reconciling or inputting, so you skip doing them.
* You struggle to plan into the future and are constantly still surprised by major expenses.
* You don't document lessons learned somehow, meaning that the same thing that foiled you once (damn you, new tires!) will foil you again.
* You regularly borrow from savings or future categories to buy things now.
* You are always seeking ""the answer"" for how to fix any of the above behaviors, but each new method you try quickly sours or you give up, and you're back at square one.

**Dopamine & Inertia: The Root Causes**

So, folks with ADHD do not create or retain the same amount of dopamine as other people do when completing daily tasks (this is a vast over-simplification, but, work with me).

* **This lack of dopamine accounts for much of the ""inattentive"" and ""hyperactive"" parts of an ADHD diagnosis** \-- restlessness, impulsivity, short attention span, forgetting things.
* **This lack of dopamine also contributes to something called ""executive dysfunction,"" which can make the starting or stopping of tasks challenging** because the brain doesn't release signals to help prompt a person to engage a task or stop a task.
* **A complex mix of dopamine, seratonin, and other neuro-traits can also influence an Autistic person to not experience the same pleasure, pain, joy, etc. responses that an allistic (meaning, neuro-typical) person experiences.** For example, it may simply not feel like a meaningful priority to save up for your mom's birthday present because you don't think much about birthdays. But inevitably, her birthday comes and you do buy a gift and every year it wrecks your budget for the month. All because birthdays simply aren't front of mind for you and you don't feel an emotional tug about them.

Now, when it comes to YNAB, you are probably already connecting the dots. Someone who's been diagnosed with ADHD or Autism may struggle to get traction with budgeting simply because... well, it's not ""fun"" for them and does not produce a meaningfully stimulating response. It's either boring (ADHD), overwhelming (AudHD), or just doesn't have emotional gravitas (Autism).

With this dopamine-deficiency in mind, let's also consider what I'll call ""inertia,"" which is my shorthand for coping mechanisms or routines that arise when a neurodiverse person tries to manage their own environment and neurology through repeated behaviors.

Statistically, we know that many people with substance abuse disorders are neurodiverse. Same with gambling, etc. These are behaviors that produce lightning bolts of dopamine! So it makes sense they'd appeal to people who struggle for that satisfied feeling otherwise. *Impulse spending is also an addictive behavior that feeds the dopamine loop.*

Then, factor in the good ole 'tism, where repeated behaviors are ""safety practices"" or are used to help bring order and regulation to an Autistic or AudHD person's life. Routine is often the beloved friend of the Autist, even when routine doesn't seem to align with organization or making other savvy decisions. Routine is not about being great at making decisions! *Routine is about feeling safe and comfortable making the same decisions over and over.* And so we can see that routine behaviors also feed this dopamine loop.

Now, imagine you are a neurodiverse person (or share these experiences in common with them). You've always spent like you're made of money because it makes you happy to do so in the moment. Even if you feel ashamed or regretful later, the dopamine boost of swiping your credit card is so appealing in the moment that pursuing stasis that way *becomes a repetitive behavior,* and your impulse spending *becomes a routine,* and you struggle to break that routine because *it gives you both dopamine and reliability.*

Then, of course, the dominos fall: You end up on credit card float. You can't get ahead of interest. You become frustrated and overwhelmed, triggering even more issues with executive function and impulsivity and avoidance. Your brain is clinging to its crumbs of dopamine and is terrified at all the things threatening to ruin the little bit of life that felt good. And so you respond to suffering through $300 of INTEREST on your credit card by... buying yourself a little treat. Which both feeds the addictive cycle, the shame cycle, the routine-inertia-cycle, and obviously your debt cycle. So as you're on the run from your growing debt, you're still looking for those dopamine boosts and you're still finding them in all the familiar places.

And notably: Practices that guide you AWAY from those familiar behaviors (impulse spending, pulling from savings, etc.) do NOT give you a dopamine boost. In fact, they seem like dopamine antagonists because they're taking you further away from the thing that gave you the little boost! And not only that, but to engage them feels like wandering in the dark because you have no emotional or neurological pull toward these behaviors. To put better practices in place for an ADHD, AuDHD, or Autistic person might feel like telling an allistic person ""To stay alive you will need to, once an hour, recite the alphabet and hop on one foot two times."" Those behaviors would not make sense to the allistic person -- they don't seem to increase their quality of life! They're weird! They're hard to remember to do! They're uncomfortable if you're otherwise enjoying a snuggle in front of the TV! And yet.

Such is making changes for neurodiverse people.

Last but not least: neurodiverse people are prone to rumination and hyperfixation. That is, once something's on our mind -- or in our Amazon cart -- it's all we can think about. Which makes it even harder to avoid the habituated over-spending.

**What can be done?**

First and foremost, **you have so much more control than you think you do** and it is, indeed, simply a copout to say otherwise. Is making change easy?  No. Is it possible? Yes. **Are your bad habits ""just the way you are""? No. They are coping strategies you developed to navigate your neurology and you can choose to develop new habits.**

But to do so effectively, you need to understand the root causes of why you've not succeeded so far. To be clear, sometimes poverty is just damn poverty and it's horrible. Sometimes you genuinely do not have enough money to meet your needs in any way and the purchase of an iced coffee is literally the only happy thing in your life and in this case, you are not the target audience for my post. Poverty is grinding and hard and painful and you cannot easily will your way out of it.

If you are NOT in poverty, read on.

Let's say you struggle with impulse spending but wish you could change. You regularly pull from savings to cover fun expenses; you blow through your ""fun money"" early in the month; you are drowning in credit card debt, etc.

Here's the pattern you're probably stuck in:

*1. The month starts. You're eager to do well.*

*2. The month prior, you blew through your spending early and you were on scraps for two weeks. It was exhausting. And now that a new month is beginning you want or need to buy all the things you couldn't buy last month. And so you do. And so you already put a significant dent in your finances for the new month right from the start. Further, some of this spend is justified -- you did actively need toothpaste and food! So you don't feel you did anything wrong with this spend.*

*3. After depriving yourself after last month's leanness, it's hard to not want to reward yourself with some Cool Thing you'd been wanting. And so you do. Because it made you feel happier for a minute.*

*4. Maybe you didn't complete step 3! Maybe you just have your eye on some Cool Thing. All last month, you thought about The Cool Thing and wanted it. And now the new month is here, and you're still thinking about The Cool Thing, and it's plaguing you. Every minute you don't put it in your cart and hit ""buy"" is a victory, but you're losing ground. And even if you do NOT ultimately buy the thing, you've spent so long wanting it and thinking about it that NOT purchasing it makes your budget ""the bad guy"" who's in the way of your dopamine. You start to feel resistance toward your budget.*

*5. Whether via route 3 or 4, you're now broke early in the month again or you're mad about budgeting. Either way, you get zero dopamine or happiness from deciding to cook dinner on a Friday night or leaving money for retirement in your retirement category when you'd rather go to a concert. The dopamine monster starts to rear its head, and ultimately, you're off track and over-budget again sooner than you can blink. The cycle then repeats.*

While it's sometimes necessary to buy ""need"" items and have less flexible money left to do so, you're in an avalanche pattern.

**How can you break it?**

1. **Consider medication.** Before I tell you any other strategies, I'm telling you this one. If you struggle with all of the above and you will not pursue an ADHD diagnosis or try medication, you are as foolish as a person on fire claiming to not need an extinguisher. There's no gold medal for people who just sloppily flail through their own lives and refuse to get help or at least get screened -- there's usually just debt and overwhelm. I started taking Vyvanse when I was 31, and it changed my entire life: I felt less stressed, less overwhelmed, and MUCH less likely to do impulsive things just to feel better. My ex-wife, meanwhile, refused to take her Adderall and she was constantly falling apart without it. It's why we are now divorced. She was always a mess; I was trying to make my life better; I am now remarried to someone who takes their mental health seriously.
2. **Find non-purchased things to value.** Stemming from practices like meditation and gratitude journaling, you need to find a way to look at some part of your life and value it. Maybe it's gonna be your spouse and kids. Maybe a pet. Maybe your own health. Whatever it is, you need to find something where you love it enough that engaging it in a positive way gives you some dopamine.

For me, it's my wife and my cats. I love them so much. And when it clicked for me that managing our finances better was a way to care for THEM better and make THEM happy, it became much more enticing to do. Through wish-farming, just this week I surprised my frugal wife with a new iPad. She was over the moon with happiness! Through sinking funds saving, I can comfortably pay for my 15-year-old cat's FOUR MAJOR DENTAL SURGERIES IN ONE MONTH (dear lord) and all his subsequent care. And I feel so good at the vet knowing that no matter WHAT they say, I can say ""Yes, we will do that for him; we can cover that; let's do it.""

It also brings me joy to save for our vacations, because now I realize I'm letting our family down if my desire to buy running socks I don't really need right now takes money away from the trip to Thailand my wife's been dreaming of. It brings me joy to pay our car payments down faster, because I'd rather move closer to being debt free than to buy pizza just because I'm tired. My wife is ten years older than me, and I've realized that prioritizing our finances and retirement are HOW we will get to enjoy our older years together without fear or stress. To me, that realization was worth everything.

But this doesn't have to be an emotional pull that causes value. Maybe you love traveling or video games or working out. And maybe you miss going on vacation, or want to get a new system, or are tired of protein powder bankrupting you (I know I am, sigh). What if your trip could be paid off the moment you reserved your flight? What if you could have that new PC by Christmas? What if you could just sweep protein powder into the rest of your grocery budget and still have money to spare?

I know delayed gratification is challenging. But I promise you, the first time you have a success -- like buying that iPad or managing those vet bills -- the dopamine boost will be SO REAL.

3. **Start Small.** Do NOT start this process of re-framing value with something like a 20K trip to Europe. You'll get discouraged along the way. You want to start with a win. Maybe the first win is getting 1 month ahead on your cellphone bill, and then every month after that, being able to put money in a vacation account. Maybe the first win is getting a batch of frozen groceries to reduce how much fresh produce you need next time you shop, and using the extra money from that to start a wish farm for your PC.

Or maybe, honestly, you wanna go even smaller than that. My first ""wish farm"" was for a nicer ice cream scoop than the one we had. It was only $30, and we could have just bought it. But I used spare change and a few bucks a week to wish-farm it. And when we bought that darn thing out of the Wish Farm instead of our Family Spending, I was so tickled. It inspired me to start saving for my wife's iPad that way.

Pick a small win. And then, go win it. Know your own current ""limit"" too -- if you know you won't hang in there long term, pick a win you can achieve in just a week or two. Maybe something like shaving 5 bucks here and there so that you can buy takeout guilt free. Whatever works for you.

4. **Realize that you are your own worst enemy and your own best friend.** Listen, you didn't download YNAB because you felt good about your spending. You don't come on this sub hoping for magic solutions because you have zero financial stress. And yet-- *you are the cause of your own stress.* You are hurting you! You can change that pattern by seeing managing your money as a form of self-care.

You know what reduces stress? Not being worried about money.

You know what makes crises easier? Having money put aside.

You know what makes the future even more appealing than buying something today? Having a goal and believing you'll actually reach it.

You know what makes it feel less urgent to have happiness RIGHT DANG NOW? Believing that future happiness is possible and that you can and WILL secure it for yourself through making good decisions.

As a personal trainer I love says, ""You are your own most important client. Never, ever miss a meeting.""

You can show yourself love and make your life better. Not by caving to every whim, but by creating a future for yourself. The same way you wouldn't buy every toy in the toy store for a kid if you know you also need to feed and clothe them -- because that's what true care is, right? -- you can't do the same to yourself. **TRUE CARE IS NOT THE SAME THING AS INDULGENCE. SELF CARE IS NOT THE SAME THING AS INDULGENCE.** Sometimes, you create better conditions for yourself to make better decisions simply by setting yourself up for success.

**5. Cut the BS with yourself.** Not to tough-love you, here, but: You ARE making all the choices you make. You ARE choosing to click ""purchase"" on those new Jordans or that mani-pedi you can't afford. You ARE choosing to keep apps on your phone that you can't help but scroll and be tempted by. You ARE choosing to not limit your time on certain websites that you can't resist. You're doing all that. You. Not your ADHD or your Autism or your Personality Of Whatever Kind. Those are just ways your body and brain are organized. It's you who's driving. You, you, you.

To say ""My ADHD made me do it!"" when you refuse to take meds or work on your coping strategies is like hitting someone and saying ""My childhood trauma made me do it!"" You'd tell that person to go to therapy, right? You'd tell them they're causing harm, right? Well. So it is.

There is not a single thing about you except your natural eye color or skin color that's ""just the way you are."" You can choose to work on moving closer to who you want to be.

But you have to value it. You have to find a way to get dopamine from the process of changing. And that will require understanding some simple formulas:

1. Needing Dopamine + Habituated Overspending = **Self Indulgence.**
2. Self Indulgence + No Change = S**hame, Depression, and Financial Insecurity.**
3. Needing Dopamine + Identifying New Dopamine Outlets = **Self Care.**
4. Self Care + Continued Commitment to Growth = **Increasing Amounts of Dopamine and Stability.**

**Summary:**

You're in charge of your own life. Full stop. Crappy money management is NOT ""just how you are."" If you have a neurotype that prompts you to always be seeking dopamine and you've built bad habits (like overspending) to get that dopamine, it can be hard to change but change IS possible. The process of change requires you to find dopamine in other ways, likely by using gratitude or zooming out to get more perspective to identify what it is that you really value about your life. It also might require medication. If you're resistant to that, ask yourself why. If you were diabetic would you just push through without insulin? If you passed out after eating a peanut, would you refuse to get an Epi Pen? Of course not. If managing your dopamine will help you create the life you're dreaming of, talking to your GP about a stimulant medication is more than worth it.

So no, neurodiverse YNAB-ers, you are not doomed to a lifetime of impulse spending. You are in the driver's seat; you just need to choose differently about where you're going and how to get there.

And if you are not willing to do that, at the very least, stop blaming your neurology. You are doing a disservice to everyone out there with a similar neurotype who has, and is, and does, and will continue to find strategies to make good decisions. If you refuse to do the work, that's about you. Not about the community identity we share.",24,1731528874.0,ynab,20,0.83,False

It compared the way different cities have similar architecture, how coffee is the same in different cities, and other attributes — not just cityscapes. It had images throughout curated that were mosaics, showing 9 or so images from different cultures that all looked identical. IIRC it was an independent blog, not the more popular (but similar!) articles from The Atlantic (https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/08/why-every-city-feels-same-now/615556/) or New York Magazine (https://nymag.com/urbanist/article/the-unbearable-sameness-of-cities.html).

Does anyone know the article I’m talking about? It was really excellent, I’d like to save it for reference. Thank you!",1,1731528683.0,tipofmytongue,2,1.0,False
