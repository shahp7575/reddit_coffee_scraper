Yesterday I came home after 1,5hrs overtime in work and then went grocery shopping so I came home much later than usual. Aurelion was sleeping on his floating wood log on the other half of the aquarium and the moment he noticed me, he literally sprinted towards me. He was so excited to see me, wiggling, flaring and even doing spins. 
Safe to say he is familiar with me now ü§£

Who else completes their map with each pee stop, coffee break and overnight stay on each trip?

The downside is, you can‚Äôt always get it to select the right route. In this trip we headed along the Strzelecki and then down Talc Mine Road towards the back way in to Arkaroola before heading to Yunta - this was too off the beaten track for the WikiCamps map to include.

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it‚Äôs not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural.

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all.

1nwrdbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMarketing/comments/1nwrdbw/how_to_build_partnerships_that_actually_close/,How to Build Partnerships That Actually Close Deals,"Partnerships sound amazing on paper - two companies team up, share audiences, and both win. But the reality I‚Äôve seen is that most ‚Äúpartnerships‚Äù end up as coffee chats, endless emails, and no real pipeline impact.

From my experience, partnerships only work when both sides can measure a clear, shared outcome (leads, sign-ups, bookings). They need to start with genuine customer overlap, not just industry overlap - if the audiences don‚Äôt have a reason to care, the whole thing falls flat. It also helps to pilot fast instead of announcing a big ‚Äústrategic alliance.‚Äù One co-marketing campaign or webinar is enough to test if it actually converts. Finally, operational clarity is key: who owns the leads, who does the follow-up, and how is revenue attributed?

Even with those principles, I still feel like partnerships are one of the hardest growth levers to get right in marketing and business development.

Hello all. As I sit here on my couch watching some tv show I‚Äôm not fully invested in, I figured I‚Äôd try once again at reaching out to make a new friend. I‚Äôve recently moved to a new state and know no one here. I like my solitude sure, but I really enjoy engaging with people. I think we as humans need socialization. Whether that‚Äôs something we want to admit to ourselves or not is another matter. üòÖ Personally, I genuinely enjoy talking with others about their interests, hobbies, jobs, etc.

As for me, as you‚Äôve probably heard numerous times over, I am an open book. We can literally talk about the dumbest shit ever and I‚Äôd still find it interesting, because, well‚Ä¶YOU‚ÄôRE interesting.

I myself enjoy reading, I‚Äôm really big on mythology and history. I also enjoy coffee, but not like just drinking it. I like the science and math behind it all. I‚Äôm kind of a geek when it comes to it honestly. I roast when I can, and my espresso machine is my baby. I collect vinyls (or records, but I‚Äôm not snooty about it haha) and I have a few vintage comics I‚Äôve collected at one point or another. I game too, but mostly single player games, not really multiplayer (like I said, I don‚Äôt have much friends haha). I enjoy indie and horror movies mostly, but I‚Äôll watch just about anything (bonus points if you‚Äôve watched the title of my post.) Oh! And I have a dog too! He is my best friend and I‚Äôd do anything for him‚Ä¶

Aaaaaanywho, I guess, I‚Äôll leave it at that with all this and that about me stuff. But what about you? What song can‚Äôt you get enough of right now? What was the last movie you saw? Why are you REALLY here? Inquiring minds would like to know. If you‚Äôd like to talk or shoot the shit sometime, I‚Äôm always open. Feel free to reach out anytime‚Ä¶or not, it‚Äôs really no biggi, just take care of yourself. üòå",1,1759471487.0,discordfriends,0,1.0,False

There is no more red.
There is no more blue.
There is no more right.
There is no more left.
There is no more center.

After yesterday, there is us and there is them.
We have officially been pushed to the point where if we do not recognize that the time for class solidarity is upon us, the democratic American experiment is over. There is a better way out.

And that better way begins with this truth: your neighbors are not your enemies. They are not the architects of the system exploiting us; they are often its casualties. Many are simply misled, manipulated, or misinformed. Do not be cruel. Do not make fun. Open your heart and your mind for dialogue. Solidarity requires that we meet each other with respect, even when we fiercely disagree.

The Spark: Trump and Hegseth at Quantico

Two days ago at Marine Corps Base Quantico, President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed hundreds of generals and admirals. Trump declared that U.S. cities are ‚Äúthe enemy from within,‚Äù specifically naming San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, and said ‚Äúwe should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.‚Äù Hegseth echoed him.

This was not bluster at a campaign rally. It was said in front of global military leadership. It framed American communities not as places to serve, but as warzones to practice on.

That single moment changes the stakes. If we do not organize now, the state will normalize militarizing everyday life against us.

Why a General Strike Is the Right Response

When leaders call citizens the ‚Äúenemy,‚Äù they are not just talking ‚Äî they are preparing us for escalation. History shows us that once this framing is accepted inside military and security institutions, it takes root fast.

A nationwide class-solidarity strike is how ordinary people say: we will not fuel a system that seeks to train its weapons on us. By withholding our labor together, we show that power flows not from corporations or the Pentagon, but from the people who make everything function.

What We‚Äôre Building Toward: A Restorative System
This is not about chaos for chaos‚Äôs sake. We need a vision to unite around:

Democratic capitalism: Shared ownership, cooperative models, strong unions, profit-sharing, and democratic oversight of industries.


Restorative justice: Healing and accountability instead of cages and mass incarceration.


Universal healthcare: Treating care as a right, not a business.


Social systems that restore, not extract: Housing, education, caregiving, and transit designed for dignity.


Demilitarized public life: Protecting our cities from becoming ‚Äútraining grounds,‚Äù reasserting civilian oversight, and drawing hard lines between military and domestic life.


How We Talk to Each Other Matters

If we are going to build solidarity across lines of politics, faith, geography, and identity, how we engage matters as much as what we demand.

Dale Carnegie‚Äôs How to Win Friends and Influence People still offers a roadmap for breaking through hostility and misinformation without mirroring it:
Don‚Äôt criticize or condemn. Lead with empathy, not blame. ‚ÄúThis tragedy is painful for all of us. None of us wants to see violence used for political gain.‚Äù


Appreciate courage across the aisle. Thank anyone‚Äîleft, right, or center‚Äîwho speaks against violence or misinformation. It builds trust.


Arouse an eager want. Show how truth and solidarity benefit them: safer neighborhoods, stable democracy, freedom for their kids.


Be genuinely interested. Ask: ‚ÄúWhat worries you most about this situation?‚Äù Listening is how we discover shared fears and hopes.


Smile, even digitally. Tone matters. A calm opening line defuses hostility before facts are shared.


Respect their dignity. Use names, validate their right to care about the country, and admit mistakes when you make them.


Avoid the argument trap. Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre wrong.‚Äù Say: ‚ÄúI saw that too‚Äîhere‚Äôs what I found in verified reports. Does it match what you‚Äôve seen?‚Äù


On social media:

Lead with humanity, not headlines.


Pause before you post.


Frame corrections as collaboration, not combat.


Celebrate fact-checking wins.


Play the long game‚Äîchange is slow, but seeds planted with respect do grow.


Us and Them ‚Äî Without Dehumanizing Our Neighbors

When I say ‚Äúus and them,‚Äù I don‚Äôt mean Democrats vs. Republicans, rural vs. urban, conservative vs. progressive. Those lines are the distractions keeping us divided while the powerful consolidate control.

The real ‚Äúus‚Äù is every working person, every caregiver, every neighbor trying to keep their family safe. The ‚Äúthem‚Äù is the small elite willing to sacrifice us to profit and power‚Äîeven going so far as to call our communities ‚Äútraining grounds‚Äù for military practice.

Solidarity means we resist being turned against each other. It means rejecting cruelty, even toward those who are misled. It means refusing to mock, belittle, or dismiss. Instead, we lead with dialogue, dignity, and a clear demand: a restorative system for all of us.

The Time Is Now

We are out of time to wait for incremental reform. The speeches at Quantico revealed the direction this government intends to go if left unchallenged.
The only way forward is together.

The only weapon strong enough is solidarity.
The only hope is to build‚Äînot with cruelty, but with courage and compassion.

If we don‚Äôt act, our cities will become their training grounds.

If we do act, our communities can become the foundation of a restorative future.

What To Do Next ‚Äî A Call to Action

Talk to your neighbors. Not on Twitter. Not just in DMs. Knock on a door. Say: ‚ÄúHey, did you see what they said at Quantico? They called our cities training grounds. That affects both of us.‚Äù


Organize at your workplace. A strike is only possible if people coordinate where they already gather. Start a chat thread, a break-room conversation, a text chain.


Withhold labor, withhold consent. Whether it‚Äôs a formal strike, a sick-out, or a slow-down, remember: the machine cannot run without us.


Refuse cruelty. Do not dunk. Do not mock. Do not dehumanize your neighbors. Every time you resist that temptation, you keep the door open for one more person to stand with us instead of against us.


Build networks across lines. Reach out to unions, churches, mutual aid groups, parent circles, recovery meetings, veterans‚Äô organizations. Anyone willing to stand against militarizing American streets belongs in this fight.


Stay loud, stay visible. Share this message. Talk about Quantico everywhere‚Äîcoffee shops, PTA meetings, group chats. Force the story into the open. Silence is how normalization wins.


‚ö° This is the moment.

Trump and Hegseth showed their hand. They see us not as citizens but as obstacles to be subdued.

We have a choice:

Let them practice war games on our neighborhoods.


Or stand together in solidarity, refuse to be their training ground, and demand a restorative system that puts people before profit and power.


The strike is not chaos.
It is discipline.
It is love in action.
It is the people of this country, finally saying together:
You cannot train on us.
You cannot turn us into your enemy.
We are the future‚Äî
and we are already organized.

‚úä Chant It With Me:

Not red, not blue ‚Äî just me and you.
Not left, not right ‚Äî we strike, we fight.
No training grounds, no enemy within.
We are the people, and we will win.

I thought it might be interesting to talk about the cultural differences in each region, so I asked chatgpt to write a summary. Do you think this is accurate? Would love to hear your take!  

Personally I‚Äôve lived in CA and PNW and it does feel pretty spot on. In particular it was interesting to see it calling out the hustle culture in California which I felt is so true (and ultimately why we left). After reading the PNW list it aligns so much with my own hobbies and values (more nature focused outdoorsy lifestyle) so it makes sense why I love living here. 

‚∏ª

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1nwr1ri,https://www.reddit.com/r/BYON_tZERO/comments/1nwr1ri/did_marcus_lemonis_set_a_trap_for_bed_bath_beyond/,Did Marcus Lemonis Set A Trap For Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) Short Sellers?,"* BBBY has a long history of battling short sellers, including lawsuits and naked-short allegations dating back to its Overstock era.
* The recent **warrant dividend** (1 for 10, $15.50 strike, listed on NYSE) creates a new dynamic that could backfire on shorts.
* Options analysis suggests the warrants will open in the **$3.5‚Äì$4.5 range**, potentially spiking higher if volatility expand or the stock continues to move higher.
* Evidence of **heavy shorting** combined with **unexpected buy-side momentum** signals the setup for a near-term squeeze.

**The Long War With Shorts**

Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) has always been a magnet for aggressive short sellers. Long before Marcus Lemonis took the helm, the company‚Äîthen Overstock (OSTK)‚Äîwas infamous for [fighting short campaigns ](https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article_id=227398)and [filing lawsuits against Wall Street firms over naked short selling](https://www.courthousenews.com/overstock-com-settles-short-sales-litigation/). Overstock filed lawsuits, challenged the system, and [uncovered evidence of abusive shorting practices](https://x.com/kshaughnessy2/status/1955238390246363564) and ultimately won millions of dollars even though the courts dismissed key claims.

That history still hangs over BBBY today. The short float has remained stubbornly high, with investors speculating that **substantial naked short positions exist beyond the reported 5.5 million shares sold short**.

**Marcus Lemonis‚Äô Warrant Dividend ‚Äì A Simple Capital Raise or a Strategic Trap?**

The most interesting move yet occurred when Marcus and the BBBY board announced a dividend giving each shareholder **one warrant per 10 shares owned**, exercisable at **$15.50** and expiring in roughly one year. These warrants will be **listed and tradable on the NYSE**.

At first glance, the structure looks straightforward and not too problematic for short sellers:

* Shorts could sidestep by **covering before record date** and re-shorting after (Strategy A).
* Or they could maintain shorts and later **buy warrants in the open market** to make lenders whole (Strategy B).

Either way, shorts thought they had easy outs.

**The Day of Reckoning ‚Äì Record Date Trading**

On the record date (Thursday October 2, 2025), BBBY‚Äôs trading tape told a story: the stock opened above $10, then sold down aggressively to $9.79 on **10x average volume in the first 90 minutes**. This looked like shorts who had temporarily boxed positions unloading long hedges to resume net shorts.

But then came a curveball: at 10:52 a.m., [famed hedge fund manager and meme-stock-maker **Eric Jackson tweeted a photo with Marcus Lemonis in Toronto**](https://x.com/ericjackson/status/1973763085895868713). For those who don‚Äôt know who Eric Jackson is ‚Äì his [involvement in OPEN Technologies caused it to be a 12 bagger in just two months and its still trading 10x higher than it was when he started tweeting about it in mid-July](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/17/why-shares-of-opendoor-have-more-than-doubled-this/). Within minutes, BBBY surged to $10.81 before another wave of heavy selling knocked it back below $10 in a way that looked eerily similar to many short attacks that followed price surges from news or other positive catalysts over the last two years.

Unlike previous years‚Äîwhen shorts easily controlled the tape‚Äîthe difference this time was the **buy-side response**. Momentum built, fueled further by bullish news from BBBY‚Äôs 24%-owned GrainChain, which [announced a major coffee supply-chain contract in Guatemala](https://www.einpresswire.com/article/854642147/grainchain-expands-into-guatemala-to-drive-digital-transformation-in-the-coffee-sector). By the close, BBBY had squeezed to **$11.88 intraday and settled to a close of $11.75**, one of the strongest moves of Lemonis‚Äô tenure.

**Why the Warrants Matter ‚Äì Short Math Gets Ugly**

While the shorts who used Strategy A will have some concerns if the stock continues to trend higher, the biggest problem is for those who chose Strategy B. They‚Äôll have to **buy warrants in the open market** to settle their obligations.

And the math is brutal:

**Estimated BBBY $15.50 Warrant Prices vs. Implied Volatility (1 year, stock $11.75):**

* **80% IV** ‚Üí \~$2.75
* **100% IV** ‚Üí \~$3.68
* **120% IV** ‚Üí \~$4.56
* **140% IV** ‚Üí \~$5.40
* **160% IV** ‚Üí \~$6.20

Even with BBBY trading **below strike**, the warrants hold **$3.5‚Äì$4.5 in time value** at ‚Äúnormal‚Äù volatility similar to BBBY‚Äôs and other meme stocks over the last 12 months. If the Implied Volatility surges to higher levels due to volatility like BBBY experienced Thursday or the stock price pushes toward $15‚Äì16, warrant values accelerate. Above $18‚Äì20, warrants move nearly **dollar-for-dollar with common stock**. **See that even one more trading day like today for BBBY could wipe out the total capital for many short positions.**

Consider this scenario for traders who went short from $9 last week:

* Sold short at $9.00
* If covered today at $11.75 = **-$2.75 loss**
* Plus warrant liability at $3.5+ = another **-$3.5 loss**
* That‚Äôs **\~-$6 lost on a $9 trade**, wiping out two-thirds of capital. If BBBY shares have another gain tomorrow like it did today (+$1.75), those who shorted at $9 would see their capital **completely wiped out** with a $4.50 loss on the stock and more than $4.50 on the warrant.¬†
* With the warrant distribution and trading still 5-6 days away, any continuation of today‚Äôs volatility metrics or increase in BBBY‚Äôs stock price could result in a substantially higher price range for the warrants.¬†
* Any material positive news for BBBY, its 55% owned tZERO Tokenization / Crypto exchange and broker or its 24% owned Grainchain supply chain startup could bring more traders to the BBBY story, driving further demand for the shares.

**Why This Time Could Be Different**

For two years, every bullish spark in BBBY was extinguished by relentless short pressure. But yesterday‚Äôs tape showed something new: **sustained buy-side aggression that overwhelmed shorts**.

Combine that with:

* **High reported short interest** \+ suspected naked positions.
* **Warrant overhang forcing shorts to pay up**.
* **Meme catalysts** (Eric Jackson + Lemonis photo, GrainChain news, tZERO news).
* **Psychological shift**‚Äîtraders now see the warrants as a **short-squeeze accelerant**, not just dilution.

All this creates a reflexive cycle: the higher the volatility, the higher the warrant premiums, the more shorts bleed, the more momentum traders pile in.

**Conclusion** 

Marcus Lemonis may have just engineered one of the most brilliant corporate counterattacks against short sellers in modern market history.

On paper, the warrant dividend looked like dilution. In practice, it has created a **self-reinforcing squeeze mechanism**:

* Shorts now face **rising liabilities** from both the stock and warrants.
* Each uptick in price drives warrant premiums higher, **compounding their pain**.
* Meanwhile, bullish catalysts are hitting the tape (Eric Jackson‚Äôs involvement, GrainChain expansion, BBBY‚Äôs retail relaunch, almost daily news on tokenization and crypto that favors tZERO's patents and expanding business) to help traders understand BBBY's massive latent blockchain operations value.  

This isn‚Äôt business as usual ‚Äî this is the perfect setup for a **classic meme-stock reflexive loop**. Traders pile in, volatility spikes, warrants reprice higher, shorts scramble to cover, and the cycle feeds on itself.

If you‚Äôre waiting on the sidelines, understand this: **every $1 move higher could mean a 20‚Äì40% loss for shorts when you factor in the warrant premium.** That‚Äôs why one more green day like yesterday could **obliterate entire short positions**.

The trap has been sprung. The shorts are cornered. And BBBY‚Äôs upside from here is potentially explosive.

**The window to buy before the crowd figures this out and causes a surge in the price is closing fast. Whether that occurs Friday or one day next week as the warrant distribution process begins, BBBY could be entering one of the most asymmetric squeeze setups since Gamestop's fabled run.**  ",1,1759470770.0,BYON_tZERO,0,1.0,False

1nwqz39,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nwqz39,Really bummed,"So very recently, as in two days ago, I finished my first long-term sit (12 days) taking care of two German Pinschers. I walked them every single day in the morning for an hour and in the evening. I followed every instruction to the letter from the routine list they left for me. I made sure to feed them correctly, I sent them photos and videos every single day showing that they were being well taken care of. I even made sure they're home was immaculate! They had left something in a crock pot, and I only noticed it when it began to mold. I washed that for them even when they told me not to worry about it. I made sure the guest bedrooms' blankets were washed and clean, I vacuumed every other day, by the time they got home, not only was their home spotless, but their fur babies were very well taken care of! I left them a thank-you note, as I do with all of my clients. At the bottom, all I ask for is a good review if they are satisfied with the care received. I even left homemade vegan coffee cake for them because I know they're vegan. I understand not leaving a tip; that is totally optional. Plus, she already didn't seem very happy about my rate because when she booked with me, I was right there, and she kinda sarcastically was like, ""You're rich!"" I laughed it off, but it seemed kind of backhanded. Mind you, I have 15+ years of experience caring for animals. She could have gone with someone who had less experience and was cheaper.

1nwqxik,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nwqxik/the_man_of_gems_part_1_drunkard/,The Man of Gems [Part 1] Drunkard,"   ‚ÄúD1R,‚Äùthe radio buzzed on my shoulder as I was cruising through one of the many suburbs in Wilmington, NC. I thought today would have been one of the very few instances where I‚Äôd actually clock out early, before the sun starts to go underneath the horizon. However, after what I just heard didn‚Äôt give me any bode of confidence.
   
   ‚Äú10-4,‚ÄùI replied, hoping that through some miracle this didn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôd have more interruptions this night, but surely enough the sergeant‚Äôs gruff voice came through the fuzzy radio static.
   
   ‚ÄúGot a breaking and entering I‚Äôd like you to check out. Use some of that expertise you‚Äôre so famous for.‚Äù
   
   ‚ÄúYou sure you need me? I was just following up on a lead and like to go back to the station to file a statement for that car theft case. The silver dodge one.‚Äù
   
   ‚ÄúThat actually works out perfectly,‚Äùhe said with a chuckle and smirk that I knew he was making through the radio.‚ÄùWe just put this suspect in cuffs. You can interrogate ‚Äòem at the station too. And trust me you‚Äôll have a fun time with him. I‚Äôll send you the 10-20,‚Äùhe said before I had any time to object. 
  
   I groaned with a combination of annoyance and tiredness. The sergeant had it out for me ever since I joined the Wilmington PD. I knew it, he knew I knew it, pretty much the whole force knew it. All because I took his nephew‚Äôs spot in the department. Every chance he got he‚Äôd drag me on a crime scene I didn‚Äôt need to be at, and I doubt this was an exception.
   
   Thankfully, however, as I received the location, the drive wasn‚Äôt too far away, just eight to ten minutes from where I was and partially on route to the station. Maybe I would make it home reasonably after all and tuck my daughter in myself for once and not have to apologize to her nanny for staying out late again. It killed me that I didn‚Äôt see Natalie throughout the weekdays, only really spending time with her on the weekends like I‚Äôm a father going through a custody battle. In my head I blamed the sergeant for the crap he put me through, but deep down I knew I wasn‚Äôt clean either. Never had the gall to directly confront him and probably never will. Meredith, the nanny, was understanding for the most part, and she recalls to me everyday how good of a kid she is. Why wouldn‚Äôt she be? She inherited her mother‚Äôs personality after all. After thinking over the apology I might have to deliver to Meredith, it wasn‚Äôt soon until I saw the blaring red and blue lights of two police cruisers in the driveway of one of the more upper class homes in the area. I parked my car behind one of the cruisers and saw a man in a police uniform with a small flashlight in hand waving me down.
   
   ‚ÄúDetective Richards!‚Äùhe called out  from the side of the house that led to the back yard.‚ÄùThe scene‚Äôs out back, this way.‚ÄùAfter getting a better look at him I saw he was, thankfully, not the sergeant, but officer Barbs. He was the junior officer and even a few years younger than me. He probably could‚Äôve counted the amount of calls he‚Äôs taken on two hands. Despite him being a green horn, his naivety and friendly nature was a quality that made him approachable and trusting.
   
   ‚ÄúWhat exactly happened?‚ÄùI asked as I got closer to start trailing him to the fenced area.
   
   ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs definitely an interesting case, but I‚Äôm leaning towards a drunk guy doin‚Äô drunk things.‚Äùhe said pointing at the fence gate where the metal lock was busted open. Looks like it was done with bolt cutters‚ÄùHe supposedly did that to the gate, and then started messin‚Äô with the family‚Äôs back yard.‚Äù
   
   ‚ÄúMessing?‚Äù
  
   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see,‚Äùand then he opened the gate that revealed a peculiar sight. No less ten holes littered the back yard, each about an entire foot deep. A couple who stood near the sliding door wrapped in blankets were speaking to another cop, officer Carter. Looking at how inconsolable they were, it didn‚Äôt look like she was going to get a decent statement out of them. On the other side of the yard were two other officers next to a single oak tree, one of course being the sergeant. Even seeing him caused me to roll my eyes. The other officer, officer Pealing, seemed to be talking to who I assumed was the suspect just out of view behind the oak tree. After navigating around the small pits, making sure not to embarrass myself by tripping on one of them, I made it to the suspect to get a good look at him.
   
   His skin was pale and sweaty, further leading to the obvious conclusion that he dug these holes. His attire was off, to say the least. He wore a simple button shirt, and what looked to be dark red skin tight pants. On his feet were heavy boots that seemed to be in their final days, as one of them was cut open at the toes and the other didn‚Äôt look much better. His clothes in general were very tattered and old, and to put it lightly, he didn‚Äôt act in the right state of mind. He just sat against the tree with his head hunched forward not answering any questions Pealing was asking, only giving some tired groans every once and while.
   
   ‚ÄúYeah, I think he might‚Äôve had a little too much to drink at the pub,‚Äù Pealing said in a bad British accent while standing back up.
   
   ‚ÄúPub?‚Äù I raised an eyebrow.
  
   Pealing jumped a little before turning around,‚ÄùOh, detective Richards! Didn‚Äôt seeya there kid. Before you arrived he was answering some questions, that bein‚Äô in a British accent,‚Äùhe stated now going back to his heavy southern accent. Of all the southerners I‚Äôve met, Pealing was the best to ever do it. He‚Äôd be the spitting image of an American by the standards of someone out of the US. He loved guns, loved America, and was a little overweight. I even saw him wearing a cowboy hat off the clock. Despite his intimidating figure, being well over six feet tall, he was described as the ‚Äúgentle giant‚Äù in the station.
   
   ‚ÄúBritish huh, he have any ID?‚Äù
   
   ‚ÄúNope,‚Äùthe sergeant intervened sternly,‚ÄùHe don‚Äôt have no ID, no wallet, no weapon, no nothin.‚Äù
   
   The sergeant was born just before the end of World War Two. He served in Vietnam, then became and has been a police sergeant for almost two decades. He may be a jackass, but he had his reasons, probably of which mortal man will never know.
   
   ‚ÄúOfficer Barbs and I were the first on scene. Only thing he had was the shovel which he presumably got in there,‚Äùthe Sergeant gestured over to the shed in the corner of the yard against the house. Its door was kicked in and wood chips splintered off its sides and on the lawn. I found it hard to believe someone seemingly so docile had the ability to do that, but I chalked it up to the alcohol or whatever drug in his system giving him a boost and now he‚Äôs hungover.
   
   The sergeant picked him up and started walking him to his cruiser. ‚ÄúPealing and Carter can look into this more when it‚Äôs brighter outside tomorrow. I‚Äôll take this guy to the station and you can see if he‚Äôll tell us anything else about him. C‚Äômon Barbs, we‚Äôre going back to the station.‚Äù   ‚ÄúAlright Serg,‚ÄùThe green horn walked away from the shed and turned to give a final ‚Äútake care‚Äù to me and Pealing before following the sergeant out of the yard.
   
   By this time Carter finished talking to the couple, looking irritated as usual. She was raised in New York and swore like a sailor. Immature, but sincere when she needed to be, and wasn‚Äôt afraid to take life threatening risks too. That led to her once saving some kids in a house fire when a fire truck had gotten into an accident from some idiot who didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôre supposed to pull over for emergency vehicles.
   
   ‚ÄúResidents don‚Äôt know shit. Never seen the man before, and they say nobody ever came snooping around their house. Looks like some drug addict, plain and simple.‚Äù
  
   ‚ÄúMost likely,‚ÄùI agreed.‚ÄùI didn‚Äôt smell any alcohol on him though, so my guess would be heroin, given how he is.‚Äù
   
   It wasn‚Äôt soon after we cooled the nerves of the residents and told them if they had any more issues to call immediately. Then I was following officers Pealing and Carter back to the station. When I walked inside it was just as busy as the morning, a woman filing a missing persons report for her husband, a couple in cuffs waiting to be processed, and officers going to and fro doing many sorts of things, whether it be blood work, witness interviews, or general meetings. I caught officer Barbs exiting one of the interrogation rooms.
   
   ‚ÄúWe got him processed. Physically he‚Äôs fine, only has a scraped knee when the sergeant took em‚Äô to the ground.‚Äù
  
   ‚ÄúBut I assume he‚Äôs still not talking.‚Äù
   
   ‚ÄúNothing but gibberish,‚ÄùBarbs said, shrugging his shoulders.‚ÄùBut hey maybe you‚Äôll have better luck.‚ÄùBarbs excused himself and scooted past me, I assumed to call it a day. I couldn‚Äôt help but feel jealous. I‚Äôd rather do anything than this, my least favorite part of this job: interrogations. 
   
   I was much better suited to examining crime scenes,  following leads, and connecting dots. The process of it appealed to me even when I was a kid. Interrogations on the other usually led to me wasting my time talking to people high off their ass, or too stubborn to snitch out their ‚Äúfriends.‚ÄùI took a deep breath and opened the door into the small room with only a small table and two chairs, one of them being occupied by our British fellow. He was cuffed to the table and his head was faced straight down in his lap, looking decrepit as ever. I took a seat in front of him. I pulled my tape recorder and hit record.

   ‚ÄúThis is Detective Richards, and it‚Äôs June 28th, 1999, 20:39. Hello Sir,‚ÄùI said putting on the best friendly voice I could.‚ÄùMind telling what happened tonight, at least what you remember?‚ÄùThe man groaned after I finished talking, like a child pouting after throwing a tantrum.‚ÄùSir, I can only help you if you‚Äôre willing to talk.‚ÄùThe man slowly lifted his head to show me his face that looked more exhausted than mine. Bags under his bloodshot and teary eyes gave me some pity towards him, but nonetheless I continued.

   ‚ÄúCan you at least tell me your name first?‚Äù

   ‚ÄúAh wa a cowey.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù

   ‚ÄúI said, ah wan a coffee.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúWill you answer my questions if I get you a coffee?‚Äù

   He said nothing, only giving a slow nod, not really looking at me, his eyes glazed over. I exited the room, and headed down the hallway to start pouring him a cup, hoping he wouldn‚Äôt care what kind it was. When I returned though I saw him through the door‚Äôs window he slumped up against it. Before letting out an ‚Äúoh great‚Äù I stopped myself in my tracks. He was cuffed to that table that nailed into the floor. There‚Äôs no way he could‚Äôve, but sure enough it was exactly what I knew it couldn‚Äôt be. He had broken the hand cuffs, the metal chain split open. I told him to sit down, a little nervous, but he complied, slumping back in his chair. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, there are some strong guys that can break through cuffs, I‚Äôm not denying that, but this guy, in his state. The man weighed no more than 180 pounds and was still half asleep. Even if he tried something I should‚Äôve heard some struggle. I wasn‚Äôt that far away. The only solution is that he did it so easily he didn‚Äôt need to struggle. My brain raced with thoughts trying to come up with some other explanation, but another thought came into my head, one equally as confusing and concerning. The sergeant said he had nothing on him when he had been apprehended, so how the hell did he break through that gate lock?

I‚Äôll be in Denver from **Oct 4 ‚Äì Nov 14** to scope out neighborhoods (currently leaning toward Lakewood/west-southwest Denver, but also checking Golden, Wheat Ridge, Arvada, RiNo, Broomfield County etc.) as I prepare for a move. While I‚Äôm out there, I‚Äôd love some guidance from locals and maybe make a few connections along the way.

Subreddit related:

* Pros and cons of the Lakewood/West/Southwest Denver area?
* Other areas you recommend I look into considering my interests?
* Property management company/agent recommendations that can help me find exactly what I'm looking for in the area I want.
* What to be aware of and things to look out for while venturing greater Denver? Good, bad, ugly. PS. I'm not a worry wart nor Karen about city life. Just don't want to aim naively if I can avoid it...

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm into:

* üèçÔ∏è **Riding** ‚Äì dirt bikes & street bikes. Curious where people ride (day trips, trails, meetups). Any local shops that rent out bikes as I do plan on riding Rampart Range for day or two.
* üèïÔ∏è **Outdoors** ‚Äì camping, hiking, exploring close-to-Denver trails (foot/bike) and parks. Skiing, MTB, climbing etc.
* üé∂ **Music** ‚Äì I DJ house/techno and love checking out local events, clubs, and underground scenes.
* üçú **Food** ‚Äì always down for good eats, coffee shops, breweries, and hidden gems.

A few things I‚Äôm hoping to learn while I‚Äôm there:

* Which neighborhoods you think are underrated or overlooked (especially with space for bikes/toys/tools/garage).
* Local spots for house/techno events (clubs, warehouses, collectives).
* Best trails for riding dirt bikes within a reasonable drive of Denver.
* Favorite food/lounge/dive bar spots locals enjoy.
* Community groups or meetups where people are welcoming to newcomers.

If you‚Äôre into any of this, I‚Äôd love to hear your recs ‚Äî and if anyone‚Äôs up for grabbing a food/drink, riding, or hitting an event while I‚Äôm in town, let‚Äôs link up!

For example, my phone key works intermittently, where I have to kill the app and reset to log in. Driver settings are sometimes in random places, and the connectivity seems to go out at least once a month, auto drive sucks and randomly breaks hard on the hwy. 

The thing I‚Äôve liked the most from the Tesla is that in 5 years it‚Äôs never gone into the shop, sure the fit and finish are bad but it just kinda works.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

As for me, as you‚Äôve probably heard numerous times over, I am an open book. We can literally talk about the dumbest shit ever and I‚Äôd still find it interesting, because, well‚Ä¶YOU‚ÄôRE interesting.

I myself enjoy reading, I‚Äôm really big on mythology and history. I also enjoy coffee, but not like just drinking it. I like the science and math behind it all. I‚Äôm kind of a geek when it comes to it honestly. I roast when I can, and my espresso machine is my baby. I collect vinyls (or records, but I‚Äôm not snooty about it haha) and I have a few vintage comics I‚Äôve collected at one point or another. I game too, but mostly single player games, not really multiplayer (like I said, I don‚Äôt have much friends haha). I enjoy indie and horror movies mostly, but I‚Äôll watch just about anything (bonus points if you‚Äôve watched the title of my post.) Oh! And I have a dog too! He is my best friend and I‚Äôd do anything for him‚Ä¶

Aaaaaanywho, I guess, I‚Äôll leave it at that with all this and that about me stuff. But what about you? What song can‚Äôt you get enough of right now? What was the last movie you saw?

I got chewed by the DON the other day too for only being able to do med pass on 16 out of 26 of the residents in my assigned area and berated me for refusing to work solo without a preceptor and for not being used to the job yet and told me that the average days people got used to the job in the facility was 6 days.

I take it in the morning with Matcha and i can swear its not about the L-theanine , im a very caffeine sensitive guy and even small dose of caffeine like coffee or tea can make me jittery and shaky , but taking the butterfly pea flower powder eliminated all of my anxious physical sensations. And its works every damn time unlike L-theanine which is a hit or miss for me and its not that potent i believe.

Now i can not wait to enjoy my cup of matcha and butterfly pea the next morning to reach that state again , it's a very productive and lovely way to enjoy life.

Competitive Start: We'll hit up a top-tier bowling alley in the city for a game or two. I‚Äôm looking for someone who doesn't mind a little friendly rivalry and can handle being high-fived after I (or they!) nail a strike.
Relaxed Debrief: After we‚Äôve settled the score, we‚Äôll transition to a cozy, highly-rated cafe. The goal is quality coffee/tea, good vibes, and a genuinely engaging conversation. I‚Äôm open to discovering a new favorite spot!
The Ideal Match:
Age/Vibe: Generally in their mid-20s to early 30s (flexible) and someone who is mature, positive, and easy to connect with.
Action-Oriented: You're not a flake. You commit to plans, you show up, and you appreciate making the most of a weekend.
Mindset: Open to meeting someone new and interested in building a solid, fun friendship, not just a one-off meetup.

A friend is going through some difficult stresses and has had to move away from the city, coincidentally around the same time I was also moving to a different town.

To kill 2 birds one stone and save her the hassle of listing all their furniture and appliances on market place I suggested I'd buy what I could afford and need.

In fairness, I had to leave some of my personal things at her house for a few weeks as I arranged removalist to pick everything up, as I would have moved by then anyway and it needed a lorry due large amount.

When a few weeks later when everything finally arrives, bear in mind at this point id been sitting in an empty house eating take out for 2 weeks (as her sister had also been living with her, and her move out date as a little after my own) on arrival its as if she had just left everything as is and that was that. What do I mean by that?

Rancid milk bottle in the fridge.
Food particles throughout fridge and freezer from a year or two of use.

Sofa / cushions unwashed.. fair enough on that one it's easy to wash them.

Coffee table dirty stains etc

Microwave full of food stains

Washing machine dirty 

Is that just how some people live? I am really confused by this. I would never leave anything in a state if being sold, even to a stranger.

I love the ocean and the redwoods. I enjoy visiting little cities along the coast when I have the opportunity. Bodega Bay and Mendocino are my favorites. Living near the ocean someday would be a dream come true. 

I enjoy reading, photography, journaling, and junk journaling/scrapbooking. I love music and spend a lot of my free time listening to it. I adore Olivia Dean, Cat Burns, Conan Gray, Mega, and Griff, to name a few of my favorite artists. I also enjoy indie bookstores, botanical gardens, cute coffee shops, art galleries and horror movies.

Soothe yourself with music, with good coffee, with movement, with exercise with sunlight. Make it a goal that you are getting all of this. And show to yourself you are fine without thier validation and thier changing love and thier changing views on you, thuer changing minds on weather they like you or not 


Paint your sorrrow into those trees and empty roads. Forget about it. To heal you must forget about it, only remember they changed their mind about you or they got to know the real insecure you and they were mortified of it, own your insecurity. wear it like a jewel like one wears the battle scars, you were wounded but you came out alive.

I dont know life's meaning, it looked like it was people. But it isnt thier love you should still yearn for child, you are grown up you are on your own adventure. Keep yourself busy and if they have checkout, its thier loss again, your love is immaterial and you will not change it according to thier moods and temperament.

Stand by yourself when no one is standing for you. Learn to lead yourself now that the man is gone and he loves his bachelorness , he doesnt want a woman. Leave darling leave that place which doesnt become better with your coming in ",2,1759467652.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I thought my low energy and burnout was just depression . But it wasn't it just depression that was causing low energy. It was having PMDD, High cortisol, AND eating carbs during the day (of course depression didn't help). Recently I shared what i was experiencing with AI and it helped me figure out the vitamins/supplements to take to reduce PMDD symptoms (still testing but I'm feeling hopeful) and how to solve my low energy during the day. I've listed the supplements and brands below as well as my new energy-changing diet: no carbs during day. only carbs for dinner. during the day I eat only protein and healthy fat. 



Hi Everyone, 

Wanted to share something that recently changed my life for the better. Firstly, I did a test years ago and tested very high for cortisol. This was before any of my PMDD symtoms. Anyway, i wasn't surprised because I'm and anxious and easily stressed person. I never did anthing to address this. 

**Issue number 1**: *High cortisol* 

  
Then I started working a stressful job. Everything was fine until I fell into a deep depression for about a year. It was situational depression. My symptoms were typical symptoms like suicidal ideation, sleeping a lot, abandoning taking care of myself. I sometimes couldn't work full days because I'd feel exhausted, tired, burnt out by 1 or 2 pm. I figured this was my depression. I also started to experience PMDD symptoms for the first time. Every month 1 or 2 weeks before my period, I'd feel weak and Fatigued. Walking up and down stairs was exhausting. And I'm an atheltic person. Worst of all has been mood swings and amplified depression. It would hit me like a wall. I'd really dislike life. I felt emotionally stuck. And I'd want to break up with my bf over little stuff. Every month, I'd find it especially difficult to to control my emotions, like anger and hopelessness. And then once my period started, I literally felt way better. 

**Issue number 2:** *Situational Depression* 

**Issue number 3:** *weird, new symptoms like fatigue and weakness, mood swings, lack of emotional control and lacking energy. Specifically 1 to 2 weeks before my period.* 

I was tired of being in a depressive hell for a year. I'd had enough. I got a therapist and a career coach. And after a couple of months I felt like myself again. I was still dealing with energy and pmdd issues, but I wasn't waking up crying hating my life. In fact i was really high on life and was even working out on my period. There was a solid month where things were really good. 

But then I lost my job. 

I explored a new career which was exciting but realized it wasn't for me and decided to go back to the job I loved (I just hated my boss and was pissed about my company). But it took me 3 months to find a new job in my field. 

And during this time I was mainly anxious. 

Still having PMDD symptoms. Low enery, fatigue, mood swings, etc.   
  
Then I got a job!

I started my new job a couple months ago. Super excited. but still dealing with PMDD, and even though i loved my new job, i noticed that I was burning out and crashing around 1 or 2 pm... this didn't make sense because I wasn't depressed anymore. So why was I crashing? I noticed that if I fasted during the day (just drank coffee and protein creamer) that I'd be able to work all day but felt dehydrated and jittery. This didn't feel sustainable or healthy. And then I'd reach for a snack  mid-day like pretzels or fruit,  I would instantly crash... 

I put my symptoms into chat gpt and they basically told how to address my PMDD and how to address my crashing and I am never going back. 

Since applying what AI has told me to follow.... I didn't even feel my last period creep up other than light cramps. I was surprised by it coming because I didn't have the 1 to 2 week pre-preiod issues I normally get. And the new ""diet"" I'm on means I have energy from 8 am to 5 pm. it feels like night and day. 

**So finally here's what i've been doing:** 



**For PMDD:** 

* **vitamin d liquid** (morning) brand: Thorne vitamin d liquid (buy it. you'll love taking it in liqid form in water every morning
* **fish oil.** (morning or afternoon),  Brand: Carlson, Norwegian, The Very Finest Fish Oil, Natural Lemon) 
* **Daily multivitamin** (morning or afternoon), Brand:  New Chapter, Every Womans One Daily Multivitamin
* **Vitamin** **b12b6** (morning or afternoon), Brand: Youthteory B12b6 essential daily 
* **two glasses of water during work** (vitamin d drops in 1 glass) . 
* **Magnesium glycenate and ashwaghana** at night. Brand: Magnesium + Ashwagandha Tablets

  
**Results: It's only been 1 period but these vitamins/supplements and PMDD symptoms going away cannot be coincidence so I'm really hoping that by sticking to this routine will subside my PMDD symptoms.** I also plan to consider taking addtional vitamin c and calcium . And it says going for walks in the morning and getting a good nights sleep should be priority too. sleep I'm good at. Morning walks...(to be continued. not really a morning person)



**For my diet:**

Due to my high cortisol and PMDD symptoms. Chat gpt recommended I drink or eat protein in the morning, even if not hungry. It also encouraged me to skip carbs and only have protein and fat for lunch. And then eat carbs in the evening for dinner. *I have zero interest in bfast so heres what I eat:* 

**Bfast:** 

8 am - 9 am Black coffee mixed with protein shake. I do a kurig coffee 10 oz and add either a full oikos protein shake from Costco or a Premier Protein shake from costco. 

  
I also take my vitamins and supplements

**Lunch:** 

12 to 2 pm protein and fats: string cheese with avocado and chicken breast (i like deli style meat like columbus), I also like oikos protein yogurt. haven't tried eggs yet but may do it one of these days. 

no carbs. No fruit. no prezels. No ""protein chips."" no popcorn. Only protein or fat. 

  
**Dinner:** 

5:30 -7 pm. tonight I had a bacon cheeseburger with tater tots and secret sauce. it was fire. And I feel fine.

  
  
**results:** literally life changing. This. friggin. works. 

Carbs. Who knew? 

Maybe you, but not me. I'm seriouly so grateful!

i'll post an update on how my PMDD symptoms are doing with my new vitamin and supplement routine. but for diet, its crystal clear my energy issues are gone. it's life changing.

1nwq2wp,https://i.redd.it/u1j3qbdnvtsf1.jpeg,Survivor-Educator Essay: I survived 20 years of captivity-level abuse. Full story is in the comments.,"First thing this morning in mediation training, we were given the Wheel of Needs. As soon as I read through it and sat with it, I felt something hit me in my solar plexus. It is still there now, tight and painful, pressing beneath my rib cage, making it hard to breathe. At fifty years old, 5‚Äô7 and weighing only 120 pounds, I live inside a body that has carried two decades of deprivation. The damage is not just emotional, not just psychological. My body tells the story too.

The Wheel shows the basics every human being requires to live with vitality: safety, rest, empathy, honesty, autonomy, community, sustenance, transcendence, challenge, and meaningful work.

When I looked at it, I realized something devastating. In twenty years together, thirteen of them married, I did not receive a single one of those needs in a healthy or consistent way. Instead, every single one was dismantled, attacked, or inverted into its opposite.

After going over all the abuse I endured, and even knowing I am probably leaving some of it out, I cannot name a single human need that he ever met.

Trigger Warning: Detailed Description of Abuse

He abused me instead of keeping me safe. He lied instead of being honest. He used me instead of respecting me. He manipulated, gaslit, and degraded me until I doubted my own mind. He called me gross, sick, and disgusting so many times that I believed him.

He hurt me physically by pushing me, knocking me down, forcing me, and strangling me multiple times. Once, while I was driving and we were not even arguing, he suddenly put his hands around my neck. He put bruises on me. He lifted the furniture I was sitting on and dropped it. He slammed his hands down on tables and walls. He broke my belongings. My home was never safe.

He hurt me emotionally by turning love into cruelty and attachment into punishment. He hurt me spiritually by hollowing out my sense of meaning and faith in life. He hurt me cognitively by destroying my ability to trust my own memory and thoughts.

He blamed me for his cheating, as if my existence forced him into betrayal. When I cried uncontrollably from the pain of it, he slapped me across the face and made me apologize. My feelings were not allowed to exist, and every act of cruelty was turned back on me as though I had caused it.

He hurt me sexually by treating my body as something he was entitled to rather than someone to cherish. He cheated with both women and men. He snuck out at night to go to massage parlors, escorts, and prostitutes for sex and drugs, often during work hours on lunch and before coming home. He even weaponized yoga, becoming a yoga instructor, cheating with another student in the class, and using poses to shame me, without ever offering support, guidance, or breath work, only judgment and rejection. He is a predator and, know this also, a pedophile.

He hurt me financially by stealing money, controlling our resources, and controlling my employment and opportunities. He destroyed my stability and made us homeless four different times.

He hurt me socially by cutting me off from family, friends, and every support I had. He isolated me completely, moving me away from every community I had built across three states until I had no one left.

He never celebrated me. Not our anniversary, not my birthday, not holidays, not even my accomplishments. Instead, he sabotaged those moments and then blamed me for the wreckage.

He was abusive toward my children. He told them I was sick and crazy. He weaponized them against each other through constant triangulation. He tried to erase their trust in me and in themselves. He interrupted their schooling and my education over and over again. He controlled their access to stability and used neglect, rejection, and cruelty as parenting tactics. He made the home unsafe not only for me but for them. Now that he is gone, my children are closer than ever. We trust each other. We are best friends, and we go everywhere together. That bond is proof that the division was never real, it was created by him.

He poisoned me by putting Roundup in my coffee. He neglected me when I was sick and abandoned me after surgeries. He convinced me I was crazy and pressured me into a five-hour psychiatric evaluation just to prove I was not.

He threatened to kill himself if I left. He threatened to kill me. He tried to drive me to the edge of suicide. He took pictures and videos of me, not kind or loving ones, but only of me at my worst, without my consent, without me knowing, even in the hospital. He woke me up on purpose, making it impossible to rest. He shamed me for resting after long days of work while he did nothing. I resorted to Adderall just to stay awake.

He humiliated me in front of others. He withheld affection, gave me the silent treatment for days, was cold and rejecting. My cats repeatedly got sick while he lived in the home, and once he was gone, they were not sick anymore. He had me committed to a mental institution. He made false allegations against me.

He spun false, ugly, and mean narratives about me behind my back. I never met a single one of his coworkers at any of his many jobs. I was never invited anywhere. He never acknowledged me on social media. His profile pictures were not even his real face because he was hiding and did not want his other supply to see me. He took off his wedding ring without ever discussing it. He told me later it was because it hurt his finger, but I only discovered it because I noticed it was gone.

He isolated me and our children from society. We were taken out of regular life, no parks, no beaches, no movies, no outings, no ordinary experiences at all. We did not do the things most families do. For me, it was like living in a COVID shutdown for twenty years straight. The world kept moving, but I was cut off from it.

He made me so afraid of going outside that even when I tried to step back into the world through the workforce pilot program to work in housing supports, my legs shook just walking across the bridge to the bus stop. I carried that fear into every step. In the end, his abuse sabotaged it, and I lost that job too. I have never been fired before.

For my children, it was all they knew. My two youngest grew up only in survival mode, never knowing what stability or safety felt like. My youngest son has only ever had one birthday party. They were taken out of school, and he interrupted my education over and over again. The message was always the same: we were not allowed to belong to the world outside him. Now, stepping into the world feels like waking up from a coma. I have been away for so long that I am still learning things most people take for granted, even the different kinds of cars on the road are new to me.

He controlled every part of my life. He hurt me in ways I still do not even have words for.

Abuse was not one thing. It was everything.

The Aftermath

What I survived was not ‚Äúgarden-variety DV.‚Äù It was long-term, chronic coercive control and deprivation. It rewired my nervous system in ways most therapists are not trained to treat. And when you finally get out, you go looking for help and realize there is basically none.

On my insurance, there are no trauma-specialized providers who understand coercive control. Many are called ‚Äútrauma-informed,‚Äù but that only means they have taken a training, not that they can treat someone who lived through decades of captivity and slow violence. Survivors like me are left to self-heal, self-educate, and self-resource, often while still living with nothing.

And yet here I am. October 2, not even a year since he finally left on December 5. I am in mediation training, studying the very systems that failed me. People see strength, preparation, moving forward. What they do not see is that my over-preparedness is trauma armor. They do not see how completely I erased my own needs just to survive. They do not see that I am only now beginning to learn I am allowed to have needs again.

Even now, abuse has not ended. My children and I face eviction after my rental home began collapsing structurally; the ceiling sagging, the walls separating, the floors buckling. My landlord refuses to release the inspection report. I lost my home daycare because the home was unsafe, and without income, we are being dragged into eviction court. After twenty years of captivity, the system itself continues the displacement he began.

Why I Share

I write this not only to survive but to educate. Survivors like me exist, though many do not make it out alive. This is not ‚Äúa bad marriage‚Äù or ‚Äúmutual conflict.‚Äù It is captivity-level abuse. It is coercive control. It strips away every human need until nothing is left.

Abuse tried to erase me for twenty years. It failed.

For the last 10 years, I‚Äôve been a consultant helping businesses with tech and supply chain strategy. It was a great career, but I kept running into the same frustrating problem: my smaller clients were getting absolutely hammered by counterfeiters, and there was nothing I could recommend that wasn‚Äôt enterprise-level, six-figure software.

The global counterfeit market is a monster ($300 billion plus for just Pharma and luxury), but all the weapons are in the hands of the giants.

So, I decided to do something about it.

I have taken the leap and I‚Äôm now a one-man-show building TraceSecure, a platform to give SMEs the power to prove the products are authentic. I am using Polygon (a low-cost blockchain) to create unique digital identities for physical products, so anyone from a coffee exporter to a handbag designer can protect their brand.

*Roast my landing page: does the value proposition make sense? Is it clear? Is it compelling? https://tracesecure.co

*Roast my idea: is this a problem worth solving? Am I crazy for trying to tackle this solo?

I am in the ‚Äúpre-revenue, pre-funding, just-a-ton-of-code-and-a-dream‚Äù stage, so your honest feedback now is worth its weight in gold.

Thank you for being a part of the journey.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Hello, welcome to the Rodio, and my ‚ÄúToday I fucked up‚Äù. There is some setting of the scene we gotta go through first. Let‚Äôs introduce the characters and backstory first. I will try to give as much detail without giving too much, as I know at least a few people in my family use Reddit, and god forbid this goes viral, then I'm so royally fucked.¬†

	First, a little about myself, I am a 26 F. I love my family and want to see the best in them, even though they seem to take a lot more than I‚Äôm willing to give sometimes.¬†

	My Mom (37F) \[ she is actually step Mom, but she had adopted me about 3 years into their relationship, and has been more of a Mom than my bio so I just call her Mom\] left my dad after a 6-year relationship, where I do not believe either of them was making smart decisions, seeing as my father is currently 52(-was 43 when they got together). They haven‚Äôt been together for 3 years now. She has had a few relationships (and is currently in one, idk if it 100% matters with everything else going on, but there you go). My grandmother tried to talk to them a few times. ‚ÄúAre you sure you want this?‚Äù and all of that while they were together. My dad was unemployed for the entirety of their relationship. I helped pay bills once I turned 18, but was in a bad relationship (I moved away for a little under a year before moving back in with Mom and Dad), and turns out a lot more people than I had originally attributed it to were likely involved in at least financial manipulation. I helped for realistically 1 year, where I literally withered away and was severely underweight. I moved out of their home when I was 20 and continued to pay a ‚Äústorage fee‚Äù that was the same amount as my rent while I lived there, my phone bill, and a couple of other bills to them until I could move off of their plans, all while living with my boyfriend of the time. Etc. As I moved off their bills, especially the phone, they had their own bombs and crises as I did so. And as is with my ‚Äúcaring community,‚Äù I was constantly guilted and felt like I was leaving them to die if I didn't help them with about ¬Ω, sometimes ¬æ of my checks going to a place I was NO LONGER LIVING (can not stress that enough).¬†

Anyway, my little brother (currently 16) and Gma (76, before she passed {we‚Äôre getting there}) had a grandchildly relationship. My little sibling (Tim) is not related by blood to my dad or grandmother. I don't believe Dad officially adopted L, as Mom did to me and my Big Sibling (Cas 30 y/o).¬†

My Mom and Cas never got to live together, and they don't actually understand one another ( I have lived with both, and tbh, that is an impossible task for anyone, let alone two people who are constantly upset with one another). I know Cas feels like an afterthought to me, as I was adopted first and was able to build a relationship with Tim and Mom. Neither of them, from what I have seen and been told, has really tried to reach out or talk to one another since Mom and Dad broke up.¬†

BS is a good person at heart, but tends to get into their head and makes everything fucking harder. They also tend to not only be a little selfish but somehow have a harder head than a taurus (if you know you know), and they always want to be right, they‚Äôre trying to do and be better, but I think they flop more than they realize.¬†

Now on to the story, so sorry for all the background sssssshhhhhhhhhhhhit.¬†

I got the call 2 weeks ago (now) that my grandmother was not doing well, and I should try to make it to her, as she lives in a state bordering ours, to say my final goodbyes. Both my husband(27M) and I make the plans and coordinate with our small crews (6 people tops) to eek out 2 days to go. The week went by in a haze as my Grandmother helped raise us - by helped I mean she did 70-90% of it, depending on the day, and dad took credit.- and this felt more like I would be going up to see my Mom before she passed.¬†

Gma requested my hubby be there, and I thought as we were leaving for our 4-hour drive there, I got the thought to text my Mom, not having the balls to tell my little brother myself. ( partial f up here ) \[hindsight being 20/20 I should have just had her call outTimand taken them myself but in my greaf I had hardly been able to eat or sleep so I wasn‚Äôt thinking straight\]. I wanted my little sibling to have the chance to see Gma and have that closure if he wanted it. Mom then asked if they would be accepted up there. I told her I wasn‚Äôt sure, but would ask, as her and dad‚Äôs post-breakup relationship has been absolutely minimal on both sides (seems mutual, but idk if that‚Äôs out of fear/grief/traumas/etc). Either way, I don't think she and Dad have had a productive and non-problematic exchange since maybe a year or so after I moved out.¬†

We get there after a long and tense drive. My family (with whom I have kept minimal contact for the past few years, for the previously mentioned) greets me and lets me go to see Gma. My hubby and I are there all that day, mostly being with and watching my sleepy Gma. There is a point in the day when we thought she was going, so I asked if she wanted to see L. She said yes, so I called Mom, giving her the go-ahead and telling her to get there sooner rather than later.¬†

	The next day, we go and spend as much time with them as we can, but I have to go back home for work (like I mentioned, 6 people tops in both our crews), so unfortunately, I feel I have to go and continue on the corporate American hellscape. Mom and my siblings are there with Gpa when Gma passes. My grandfather isn't all there on the best of days, and he just watched his wife pass (they didn't always get along, but I know he loved her and she him very much). Mom asks if she can have a few things from Gma‚Äôs room. Gpa says yes, and so does Cas. She ended up taking a bottle of perfume and a couple of shirts. Less than 2 hours later, after Mom and Tim have left, Gpa is looking for ‚Äúher favorite perfume, the one she wore on dates,‚Äù and can't find it. Cas gets him to describe it, and it's the one Mom took. Mom and Cas don't really get along, or even know each other that well, and I get dragged in after Cas confirms Mom has it. I have a much better but still not perfect relationship with Mom.¬†

	I asked Mom for it back and tried to explain over text, phone, and in person, for the next 2 days, that Gpa didn't realize which one it was.

Less than an hour after Gpa had realized which one it was, and Cas had asked for it back, Mom started arguing with Cas about not wanting to give back the perfume and that it was only fair she got to keep it because she¬† ‚Äúdidn't get to pick at‚Äù Gma‚Äôs jewelry. THAT is when I get dragged into the fighting ring. (She said that exact phrase more times than I can count over those 2 days.)

I then started talking to mom and trying to explain Gpa didn't realize which perfume she had taken, and she reiterated that she felt entitled to it because she didn't get to pick at the jewelry. I explain that we haven't even looked at her jewelry since Gma and Gpa have moved a few times in the last 2 years, and a lot of their things are still in boxes from the most recent moving arrangements. Mom said, ‚ÄúNo, I saw Cas and Dad looking at the jewelry.‚Äù I explained that the only bits of her jewelry we knew where they were located were items she wanted to go to specific people. I explained that most of her items were still in these boxes around Gpa‚Äôs house, and when we found the bulk of Gma‚Äôs jewelry, she could look at and potentially have some then.¬†

She relents and says she can give it back, but she still feels bad that she didn‚Äôt get any jewelry. I explained that she can once we find it, and she still wanted to keep the perfume. I apologise and ask her if she would be cool with splitting up the perfume, and she can have one of the small containers, but Gpa can still have the one his wife owned. She told me it wasn‚Äôt fair that her item was the only thing being asked back. I didn‚Äôt know what to say, so I offered to buy a new bottle of the same perfume that we could divvy up, and she could keep the new bottle, but Gpa should have the one Gma owned if he wanted. She brought up the jewelry again, and I once again explained that she can have some once we find the rest of it. I then make plans for her to come over THE DAY AFTER GMA PASSED to divvy up the perfume, go to Michaels and get bottles, and leave the big bottle with me to give to Gpa when he brought Cas the next day. (Cas doesn‚Äôt have a car, so he would be taking them home).¬†

The next day comes, and I go to pick her and Tim up because she hadn‚Äôt slept well that night. I stop and get muffins for everyone and make coffee when we get to my place. While Tim played video games in the other room, Mom and I sat and talked in circles pretty much until she and Tim decided they wanted to go home. Because of the very long talk and emotional drainage, I actually forgot all about Michaels, and I think she let me. So I drove them home and didn‚Äôt think about the perfume for a couple of hours until hubby came home and asked:¬†

‚ÄúSo where‚Äôs the perfume?‚Äù I curse like a sailor and realize I hadn‚Äôt done half of what we‚Äôd planned the day before.¬†

I texted my mom that night, asking her for it back again, but my mom ghosted me that night. I gave up after a couple of unread messages and decided to deal with it before work the next day. I woke up and texted her asking what her game plan was, and saw her 3 dots pop up and disappear in our texting app. I stalled omw to work, about to give up, and try again after work, when I got a text from Mom.¬†

Mom said, ‚ÄúI don't care who comes to get it. I‚Äôm hurt, so unbelievably hurt, that I was given permission by Gpa and Cas before I left that day, and now I gotta give it back when I was given permission. It‚Äôs HIGHLY insensitive whether it was intended or not. I‚Äôm so hurt, and it feels like that doesn‚Äôt matter here. How would it feel if Gpa asked for her (Gma‚Äôs) jewelry back? I‚Äôm aware of what it is and that Gma is Gpa‚Äôs wife. I don't need a reminder, as if I could forget. But if you want to come get it to make things easier, or send my address to them, you are more than welcome. But don't take any frustrated tones in this message as directed at you; none of it is directed at you, okay? I‚Äôm mad at Cas and Gpa. I‚Äôm literally shaking, I'm so mad right now.‚Äù¬†¬†

I texted back that I would swing by omw to work and we could talk more after work, and that I was sorry she felt hurt. Then call my husband to help calm me down.¬†

I arrive, knock on the door, and wait for her to open it, hopefully with the perfume, maybe a little mad, but I am still willing to run circles with her after work and maybe reach an agreement that makes her happier. Her front door has a screen door on the outside, and usually she would smile and greet you in the doorway. She does not do that this time. I may make myself more of an unfeeling dick here, but I walk in and say: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre hurt, Mom. We can talk about this more after I get off work today. Is that okay?‚Äù Her only response is to hold out her hand and show me its visible shake. I try to apologize again, but as she is walking to her purse to get the perfume inside, she brings up the jewelry again as she slaps the perfume into my hand and hugs me as I am desperately trying not to lose my temper at her. I start to apologise again, and she then says:

‚ÄúWell, I just don't understand. How would you feel if he asked for Gma‚Äôs jewelry back?‚Äù Here, I lose my temper as I shove her away and yell while looking at her boyfriend further in the house, watching this unfold.¬†

‚ÄúWell, Mom, let's be fucking honest here Gpa is the next oldest and most likely next in line to die. And if he asked any of us for them back, we would give them back!‚Äù And storm out the door, breaking my nail in the process. I go to work and get sent home, deemed still not in the right headspace to be working where I work. (No, I will not be giving details here, it will give my family damming evidence that this is me.)¬†

Grandpa and Cas are coming back into town later that same day, but I am in such a haze from the last (now) few days that I kinda just disassociated and kept myself busy until the next morning. The next morning comes, and I get ready to actually go into work after my cluster fuck of a mid-week weekend and finally text my grandfather directly. Where he is staying is in the opposite direction from my work, and I don't have time to run it to him before heading to work if I want to be there on time. So I sent him my work address (on his way out of state), and if he doesn't mind swinging by and giving me a call when he gets there, I'd run it to him. Not a problem.¬†

His reply made my stomach drop: ‚ÄúYou can keep it, darling. Love you‚Äù¬†

	Immediately, I reply, ‚ÄúI thought you wanted it.‚Äù¬†

	‚ÄúNo, Cas might have though.‚Äù I then check and double-check with him about the perfume, making sure he understands what I have and it's not a problem if he wants it. He‚Äôs sure.¬†

	I then check with Cas because what the actual fuck. I send screenshots, and their reply is simply ‚ÄúMaybe he changed his mind, or I misunderstood something‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I really thought he wanted it‚Äù¬†

	I have not tried to talk to Cas or my Mom more about this yet. I don't know how or what to say to my mom or Cas since. I‚Äôm worried my little brother will be mad at me because of all of this. I don't know what to say to Mom or how to confront Cas about all of this, as we hadn't talked for a while before everything with Gma.¬†

	I‚Äôm mostly just here to rant and maybe get some advice because this is how everything with my family goes. It‚Äôs frustrating and exhausting, and somehow, according to everyone who has met my family, I‚Äôm the most mature of them. I am an avid watcher of Smosh reads Reddit, and tbh I‚Äôm so scared that I‚Äôll be on there in a month or so from posting (idk how long exactly it takes them from filming to posting, but that‚Äôs my rough guess) I‚Äôm worried this‚Äôll pop off like nobodies business and I‚Äôm going to be bombarded by my family soon. But that perfume is sitting on my kitchen table and I don't fucking know what to do with it now.¬†

TL:DR I didn't check with my grandfather directly about an item, and it ended with me screaming at my mom. Now I don't know what to do with the perfume/ handle this. ",0,1759466843.0,tifu,4,0.4,False

Please excuse my ignorance. I'm unfamiliar with things, and only recall small things from childhood about the bread. (This was San Francisco in the 90's.)

The family was ""Arabic,"" they served my mom very strong Turkish coffee at least once.

I used to go to get the school bus across from their house. The mom let me eat lemon halves dipped in mounds of sugar. 

She would make bread that looked like what I now know is naan, but it was as wide as the oven itself - she made one very large, flat round - I think. 

I have a faint memory of watching while she was placing the stones.

She would bake it with smooth stones on top. It came out fluffy/chewy, and with burnt charcoal bubbles. I loved it so very much. 

I felt very loved there, too.

Without any other context clues my internet searches haven't been very fruitful.

Thank you for your time and ideas.

I especially enjoy seeing all the colorful things, and screaming manana, carrot, apple, bocolli, galic and strawberrrr on top of my lungs as my assistants navigate through the shop.

Today, mama and dada picked me up from daycare and said we are going shopping. However, when we reached there I realized we had ended up at the wrong shop. 

I tried telling them, I screamed, I refused to sit on the stroller, but they still took me to this weird place full of clothes.
In midst of this, mama brought my biggest annoyance in a large cup, COFFEE! Mama and dada never give me any, but have it all the time, so I hate it. 

I rolled over on the floor marking my protest, but they continued to drink it.

Mama knows my weakness though, and showed me dresses, pants and shoes in my favorite color green, and said we are getting them for me.
That did make me quite happy. 

While I was beaming in joy, we were walking around in this strange place, and there I saw it, my favourite shop, full of colourful things. 
But mama refused to take me there, and said we need to eat instead.

I couldn‚Äôt believe she would miss this opportunity. I continued to scream as we ate there, making sure I remind them that we can still go to the right shop. But they took me back to car, and drove home.

They also seemed quite annoyed. I mean, had they gone to the right shop in the first place, they would have been so much happier. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1nwplmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1nwplmi/bruises_and_breath_heavy_topic/,Bruises and Breath (Heavy Topic),"***Before you read, I want to note that this story covers a heavy topic that may trigger some people. I also want to thank those who read this and take their time to leave suggestions in the comments. This is just a result of my getting carried away on an English assignment that covers a topic I've experienced to some degree. So, please enjoy!***

Cold tears stream down her face; the saltiness burns her dry lips. She lies on the rough carpet in her apartment's living room, her back pressed against the sharp corner of the once pearl white couch.¬†  
  
Her ears are filled with harsh, booming shouts of a man, and her hand covers her bruised left eye. His voice echoes off the thick walls, intensifying her tears. At this point, she cannot make out what the man is saying; the pounding of her heartbeat and her wailing drown out most of the yelling.  
  
After a while, the man's frustrated shouts stop, and he leaves. He slams the door behind him, shaking the apartment floor. She lies on the rough nylon strands that loop through the floor, crying a while longer.¬†  
  
She slowly comes to her feet to grab a fallen wine glass. She scrubs the long streak of red wine that stains her couch. An hour of brushing passes before it‚Äôs nearly white again. The dried salt on her cheeks cracks as she breathes the thick, stained air in her apartment.  
  
A phone set on her coffee table glows a faint blue light before it starts vibrating, shuffling slowly towards the edge. A ringtone plays, and she reaches for the phone, sporting a pick case, and puts it to her ear.¬†  
  
‚ÄúHey, Bestie!‚Äù an obnoxiously high-pitched voice shouts from the speaker, making her flinch and move the phone away  
  
‚ÄúWanna hang out? It will just be me, you, and Nick. I‚Äôm thinking this ice cream place-‚Äù The voice fades out as she thinks about her recent ‚Äòhangout‚Äô with the man.¬†  
  
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she replies blankly, interrupting jabbering her friend.  
  
‚ÄúYay! Nick has been wanting to see you for a while. He‚Äôs gonna be so happy! I mean, so am I, but he‚Äôs been really hoping to-‚Äù  
  
She hangs up the phone. She doesn‚Äôt want to listen to her friend's ramblings.  
  
A twist of the wheel in front of her pulls her into a barren parking lot. A little ice cream shop sits adjacent. It‚Äôs overgrown with vines and has peeling letters at the top; most of the vowels are missing. She walks in and recognizes the short, blonde girl in a flower dress and the tall, handsome man in baggy jeans and a polo next to her. She sits down across from them in the oddly sticky booth.  
  
‚ÄúHey, Jean!‚Äù the petite girl says a little too loudly. ‚ÄúThis place has the BEST ice cream, I saw it on Insta, I haven‚Äôt tried it yet though, so I‚Äôm excited,‚Äù she continues blabbering. Jean feels a light pain in her forehead.  
  
Jean looks at the attractive man in the polo. He stares back, examining her face with detail. Worry paints his face.¬†  
  
‚ÄúHe did it again, didn‚Äôt he?‚Äù He says with an exhausted sigh. ‚ÄúWhy do you do this to yourself?‚Äù¬†  
  
Jean feels embarrassed. She had tried to hide the evidence with makeup, but clearly very poorly. She looks down, too shy to make eye contact.  
  
‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt hit you again, did he?‚Äù Nick asks, rolling up his sleeve like he‚Äôs going to fight someone.¬†  
  
‚ÄúJames is a good guy,‚Äù Jean whispers, ‚ÄúDeep down, I know he can change. He‚Äôs been nice before.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThe only change you see is a facade, a lie, to keep you there. Have you even read the book I gave you?‚Äù James replies quickly, frustrated.  
  
Jean remembers that book. It was given to her after the 4th time she and James broke things off. She only read the first page before getting embarrassed. She doesn‚Äôt need a book to tell her about abuse. Right?  
  
It doesn‚Äôt help that James came back and threw it away a week later. Berating her for having it.  
  
The title was something like, ‚Äú‚Äò-The Devil Doesn‚Äôt Bargain,‚Äô‚Äù Nick interrupts, finishing her thought. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve said this, the book says it. How many times does it need to be said, Jean?‚Äù He exclaims in exasperation, pushing his finger into the table to get his point across.¬†  
  
She looks at the petite girl on the left, now on her phone, avoiding the awkward conversation. Jean can‚Äôt bear the conversation either. ‚ÄúCee, wanna get some ice cream now?‚Äù Asks Jean. Cee slams her phone face down on the grimy table and stands.¬†  
  
‚ÄúYes, please, I am CRAVING some of that Cherry garry or whatever it was called,‚Äù She screams. Nick also gets up. An upset expression subtly takes over his previous irritation; he just lets out a loud sigh and walks over to the counter.  
  
With ice cream in hand, the trio walks out of the shop, the bell on the door ringing behind them as they exit. Cee migrates over toward a nearby bench, and the other two follow. She‚Äôs spouting about something uninteresting‚Äîmost likely some crush from social media. Jean and Nick don‚Äôt pay much attention.  
  
‚ÄúI told you this would happen again,‚Äù Nick says with a deep sigh, licking his ice cream to cool his frustration.  
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to get hurt because of James‚Äôs need to control people. You know I‚Äôm not one to lecture or pressure, but I just want what‚Äôs best for you.‚Äù Jean lets these words ring in her head for a bit, marinating in their meaning.  
  
  
  
The cracking of tiny pebbles underneath the tires vibrates Jean‚Äôs tiny Toyota. Small drops of water start dotting the windshield. A ringing fills her ears as she thinks about James. She tries to drown it out with the radio, but static fills the car instead. The ringing gets louder. When she tries to distract herself, she ends up thinking of the pain instead. Makeup drips onto her baggy white shirt as she starts to cry.  
  
A spark ignites the kindling that covers her heart. Each breath she takes allows the embers to glow. Anxiety whisps around her head like smoke.  
  
Memories of the beatings and fights pour into her thoughts. Years of these memories come and go like a year-long slideshow. He‚Äôs imprinted hate in her heart. She mourns over her lost time, time she was used as a punching bag for the man who supposedly loved her. Her eyes shift to the windshield in front of her.  
  
The glass serves as a mirror in the shallow moonlight, showing a gorgeous woman. Cloudy hazel eyes are framed with long reddish-brown hair that flows down her back. A natural, glowing face streaked with wet makeup stares into the lunar-lit void in front. Her features are covered in tear-covered cuts and bruises, like the French countryside covered in craters and trenches.  
  
Her vision is distorted from the fiery water that burns her eyes and lips. Her foot relaxes forward, and the needle on the dashboard slowly climbs to the right. A voice tells her to do it.  
  
She screams until her lungs and throat start burning, then squeezes even more. Her head starts pounding, and the ringing seems to fill the cabin of her car. Her thoughts break through the pauses between thumps of her heart. She fights the urge to let go.  
  
The screen in the center of the car lights up, and the static on the radio is replaced by a ringtone. The pounding of her heart fills her throat, and the sound fills her ears‚Äîthump thump. Everything seems to grind to a halt‚ÄîThump thump. Her throat and lungs burn with every sharp rise of her chest.  
  
‚ÄúJames,‚Äù she whispers to herself, reading off the screen‚Äîthump thump.  
  
Everything is frozen; at a standstill. Terror fuels the anxiety and hate-filled fire in her heart. She screams louder than ever before; the fire in her heart burns hotter. She can‚Äôt take the pain anymore.  
  
As Jean grasps her thoughts, everything snaps back to speed, and Jean slams on her brakes. Her tires squeal to a stop. She takes heavy breaths, her vision blurred. A green button on the screen gets pressed by her finger.¬†  
  
James's booming voice fills the car. ‚ÄúHey Jean, I have a \*big\* surprise for you!‚Äù The call ends.  
  
Jean parks at the foot of the towering apartment building covered with vines. She sits in the powered-off vehicle under a dim yellow light coming from a somewhat nearby streetlight. A short buzz comes from the cupholder. She picks up her phone and reads the recent notification. ‚ÄúThe devil doesn‚Äôt bargain, Jean. - Nick‚Äù  
  
Her head fills with anxiety like no other. She takes a deep breath and closes her eyes.¬†  
  
‚ÄúThe devil doesn‚Äôt bargain, Jean.‚Äù Nick's voice bounces around her head with a fiery red hue. She remembers the screaming, the fighting, the hell she endured because of James.  
  
Jean's own voice fills her head, ‚ÄúHe can change, I can change him.‚Äù A dark blue hue fills her thoughts. She realizes how wrong she is. A cold tear runs down her face and splashes onto the collar of her shirt. A shiver runs down her back.  
  
She‚Äôs on edge, scared of what might happen when she goes up. Each step towards the apartment door makes her heart beat slightly faster. When she reaches the door, she can feel her heartbeat in her ears. The rhythmic beating of her heart seems to shake the whole building.  
  
She slowly brings her key to the door. She‚Äôs shaking from anxiety and barely gets the door open. The lights are dimmed with subtle, romantic music playing on a nearby speaker. James is seated on the couch in a revealing bathrobe. ‚ÄúSurprise! I got ready just for you.‚Äù He says as he looks at Jean, ignoring the state she‚Äôs in.  
  
He stands and faces Jean with his arms open. Jean makes her decision, he needs to go. She struggles to find what she wants to say. In a second, thousands of iterations of ‚Äò you need to leave‚Äô fill her head. Some polite, some not so much. Jean makes a blunt decision.  
  
‚ÄúGet out.‚Äù She says in a firm but quiet voice while stepping toward James.  
  
‚ÄúGet out of the bathrobe?‚Äù James asks with a raised eyebrow. He shrugs and starts fiddling with the knot at his waist.¬†  
  
Again, her head fills with past fights; she wants him out \*\*\*now\*\*\*.¬†  
  
Through gritted teeth and a fiery tone, Jean demands, ‚ÄúGet out of my apartment.‚Äù  
  
James's laugh fills the room. ‚ÄúAre we doing some kinky role play or something?‚Äù He replies through his booming cackles.  
  
Jean grips the side of her pants in anger. She lets out a deep breath. ‚ÄúLet me be clearer. I want you to leave my life, which starts by you walking out that door.‚Äù¬†  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really going all in, aren‚Äôt you? You have the messy makeup and everything. I thought I got ready for you.‚Äù He says with one last chuckle, not taking anything she says seriously. He grabs her waist with one arm as he continues to untie the knot with the other.  
  
Jean throws his arm off her waist. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not kidding!‚Äù She cries. ‚ÄúGet out. Right, fucking, now.‚Äù  
  
Dumbfounded, James stops untying the knot. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you saying?‚Äù¬†  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying get dressed, pack your things, and leave!‚Äù Jean yells. She feels the fire in her heart grow.  
  
Jean is shaking with anger and terror. James balls up his fists.  
  
‚ÄúIs this because your shit friend is saying I‚Äôm \*no good\* for you? He calls me a shitty boyfriend, doesn‚Äôt he? He never wanted to get to know me, you know? Only say fuck all about me, then never talk to me.‚Äù He yells back, his words piercing the air.¬†  
  
Jean takes a deep breath, trying to calm herself.  
  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because he can see the person you truly are. He unmasked you, and you couldn‚Äôt turn him against me. I didn‚Äôt understand the stuff he said about you, but now I do.‚Äù Jean argues.  
  
‚ÄúWhat am I to you, huh?‚Äù James asks in anger. ‚ÄúBecause all I‚Äôm seeing now is a faceless whore who doesn‚Äôt listen to the man of the house!‚Äù  
  
Jean is shocked by his comment, but fights back. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the Devil incarnate in my eyes. You make my life a living hell. Now get out!‚Äù  
  
They both stand there. Jean slows her breathing, thinking he‚Äôs about to leave. She doesn‚Äôt look away from James. He takes a step back and looks around the room before looking Jean up and down. He starts taking quick breaths as pure rage distorts his face. They lock eyes, and Jean‚Äôs heart drops.  
  
‚ÄúYou Bitch!‚Äù He musters before taking a quick step forward, raising his arms towards Jean‚Äôs neck. Both of his hands are tightly wrapped around Jean‚Äôs throat. He throws profanities and spit around the room as he yells. Jean flails her arms, contacting James‚Äôs arms in the process. He doesn‚Äôt flinch.  
  
‚ÄúThis is what I get for being your boyfriend? I spent my free time getting ready for you today after work. I did that even though you spilled that wine!‚Äù James howls, gripping slightly harder with every word.  
  
Jean‚Äôs face starts to turn a pale blue. Her eyes seem to almost pop out of her head. She‚Äôs lifted off the ground, allowing her to kick James in his gut. They both drop to the ground with a loud thud. Jean‚Äôs attempts to breathe again are interrupted by burning coughs. James regains his bearings and gets on top of Jean.  
  
‚ÄúYou were so easy to control.‚Äù  
  
A throbbing pain fills her left cheek as James throws a punch.  
  
‚ÄúYou were only good for the loving and my laundry.‚Äù  
  
Her jaw takes the next blow, then the side of her head.¬†  
  
‚ÄúI just had to sit and let you do everything.‚Äù  
  
One punch after another. One taunt after another. She screams as blood starts flowing down her face. She tries kicking and punching to no avail.  
  
Minutes of beating go by like hours. James stands up and looks at the carnage ‚Äî \*His\* carnage. He spits in her face as he inspects his bloodied knuckles. He shows no sign of remorse. No sign of regret. Just a face twisted with pure rage.¬†  
  
Pounding at the front door replaces James‚Äôs anger with panic. The explosion of wood and the door hitting the wall are heard as James sprints to another room. Jean‚Äôs eyes roll back into her head as she goes unconscious.  
  
Fire engulfs her, yet a chill flows through her body. Memories in the shape of small pictures fall from the open sky. They crackle as the fire consumes them. Jean catches one. It shows the cuts along her wrists; It burns in her hands, flying up as it turns to ash  
  
She catches another. A blurred arm screams towards the photo‚Äôs point of view. That too burns and levitates up.  
  
Jean stands for hours, looking over the thousands of falling photos. No emotion comes over her; A blank face is all she can express in the precipitation of snapshots.  
  
The photos start falling in smaller quantities until one lone painted rectangle falls. She catches it in the palms of her hands. A red tint blurs the image of James running into another room. It sits in her palms, staying intact, unlike the rest of the prints. She grips each corner and tears the snapshot. As soon as the paper rips in two, a white light engulfs her entire body.  
  
A looming buzz of fluorescent lights and a rhythmic beeping fills Jean‚Äôs ears as she gains consciousness. A nurse rushes in and begins to prepare some equipment. Jean slowly and strenuously props herself up as the nurse checks her vitals.¬†  
  
‚ÄúHow are you feeling, dear?‚Äù the nurse asks in a slight southern accent.¬†  
  
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some people here to visit you! I‚Äôll go get them from the waiting room, okay, honey?‚Äù The nurse rubs Jean‚Äôs shoulder before speeding out of the room.  
  
A half-dozen pairs of heavy clunking footsteps come down the hall towards Jean‚Äôs door. Nick appears surrounded by 5 police officers. He grabs the nearby chair and sits down close to the bed. Jean inspects Nick‚Äôs face. His eyes are red and puffy with purple-ish bags under them. Nick takes a shaky breath of air.  
  
‚ÄúI was so worried. I got a call and they told me what happened,‚Äù Expresses Nick. He grabs Jean's hand with both of his and holds them tight to his face. His shaky breath is the only thing Jean can focus on. A voice is drowned out by her focus. One of the officers clears his throat, and Jean‚Äôs attention shifts.¬†  
  
The officer speaks in a professional tone. ‚ÄúExcuse me, miss, we need to ask you a few questions about what happened last night.‚Äù  
  
The beeping gets faster, and Jean‚Äôs head starts spinning. Her deep breaths are replaced by sharp, shallow ones. She relives the moment and winces at each punch that plays in her head. Her eyes dart around the room before being clouded by thick tears.  
  
Everyone gets a look of panic, and a few officers rush out of the room down the hall. They return with the nurse and another man in a long white coat. The coat reminds Jean of her white couch and the wine stain, which just makes her cry harder.  
  
The officer repeats his question, trying to ignore the panic attack happening in front of him. The nurse glares at him and ushers the officers out of the room. The man in the long coat kneels down to Jean‚Äôs eye level.  
  
A calming voice floats over the room. ‚ÄúDo you think you can take a nice, deep breath for me?‚Äù¬†  
  
Jean closes her eyes and slows her shaky breathing. In. Out. She repeats this, each breath slowing the beating in her chest. She opens her eyes.  
  
‚ÄúWe will leave you two alone for a bit until you are ready.‚Äù The man says. He and the nurse walk out of the room, shutting the curtain and glass door behind them.  
  
Jean relaxes her body and lies back on the bed. She looks at Nick to her left and puts her right hand on his cheek. She feels his shaky breaths in her fingertips. They sit like this for a minute.  
  
‚ÄúThank you for waiting,‚Äù she says, forming a smile. Straining the fresh stitches woven through her head. She asks Nick, ‚ÄúHow long?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here for ‚Äî‚Äù He looks at his wristwatch. ‚Äú14 hours.‚Äù  
  
Tears start streaming down Jean‚Äôs face. Nick leans into a tight hug. She presses her face into his chest. A growing warmth floods her body. She hugs tighter, and so does he. The fire in her heart cools.  
  
Her voice is muffled as she speaks. ‚ÄúI should have listened to you sooner.‚Äù She begins wailing and bawling even harder.  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre stubborn, but you can‚Äôt change people like him.‚Äù  
  
Jean sits up and playfully punches Nick in the chest in retaliation for the ‚Äòstubborn‚Äô comment, laughing through her tears. Nick hands her a handful of nearby tissues that Jean uses to wipe her face and nose with. The pair sits there for a while, laughing and staring at each other.¬†  
  
Nick gets up and walks to the door. He calls over the officers with a wave. They surround the bed, overwhelming Jean slightly, but she is ready to talk.  
  
‚ÄúSorry about that, ma‚Äôam. I am Detective Evans. We have arrested James as of last night. Your neighbor called the police after hearing screams. We need your account to press charges.‚Äù He pulls out a notepad and flips it open, ready to write.  
  
Jean relives last night. She stares blankly at a wall as she explains what happened.  
  
‚ÄúHe grabbed me.‚Äù She says, touching her neck.  
  
Jean looks at Nick and grabs his hand as she proceeds to go through yesterday's events. Each one makes her heart race, but she calms down when Nick tightens his grip on her hand.  
  
When the interrogation is finished, the cops leave, thanking Jean on the way out. The nurse comes in, the man in the coat trailing behind her.  
  
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have y‚Äôall out of here in a bit, just a few more minutes as the doc signs some papers.‚Äù Says the nurse through a cheerful smile. Her bright mood is contagious.  
  
‚ÄúPraise God your jaw didn‚Äôt break. A miracle that is, with the beating you took.‚Äù She says, impressed, before leaving the room with some papers.  
  
Jean slides out of bed with Nick‚Äôs help. Her first few steps are stiff, so she wraps her arm around Nick, and he does the same. With discharge papers in one hand and Nick's waist in the other, they walk out of the hospital.  
  
Jean leans her head on Nick‚Äôs chest. At the same time, a huge weight dissolves from her shoulders. She takes one last deep breath to finally extinguish the hate in her heart.

!

Cold tears stream down her face; the saltiness burns her dry lips. She lies on the rough carpet in her apartment's living room, her back pressed against the sharp corner of the once pearl white couch.   
  
Her ears are filled with harsh, booming shouts of a man, and her hand covers her bruised left eye. His voice echoes off the thick walls, intensifying her tears. At this point, she cannot make out what the man is saying; the pounding of her heartbeat and her wailing drown out most of the yelling.  
  
After a while, the man's frustrated shouts stop, and he leaves. He slams the door behind him, shaking the apartment floor. She lies on the rough nylon strands that loop through the floor, crying a while longer.   
  
She slowly comes to her feet to grab a fallen wine glass. She scrubs the long streak of red wine that stains her couch. An hour of brushing passes before it‚Äôs nearly white again. The dried salt on her cheeks cracks as she breathes the thick, stained air in her apartment.  
  
A phone set on her coffee table glows a faint blue light before it starts vibrating, shuffling slowly towards the edge. A ringtone plays, and she reaches for the phone, sporting a pick case, and puts it to her ear.   
  
‚ÄúHey, Bestie!‚Äù an obnoxiously high-pitched voice shouts from the speaker, making her flinch and move the phone away  
  
‚ÄúWanna hang out? It will just be me, you, and Nick. I‚Äôm thinking this ice cream place-‚Äù The voice fades out as she thinks about her recent ‚Äòhangout‚Äô with the man.   
  
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she replies blankly, interrupting jabbering her friend.  
  
‚ÄúYay! Nick has been wanting to see you for a while. He‚Äôs gonna be so happy! I mean, so am I, but he‚Äôs been really hoping to-‚Äù  
  
She hangs up the phone. She doesn‚Äôt want to listen to her friend's ramblings.  
  
A twist of the wheel in front of her pulls her into a barren parking lot. A little ice cream shop sits adjacent. It‚Äôs overgrown with vines and has peeling letters at the top; most of the vowels are missing. She walks in and recognizes the short, blonde girl in a flower dress and the tall, handsome man in baggy jeans and a polo next to her. She sits down across from them in the oddly sticky booth.  
  
‚ÄúHey, Jean!‚Äù the petite girl says a little too loudly. ‚ÄúThis place has the BEST ice cream, I saw it on Insta, I haven‚Äôt tried it yet though, so I‚Äôm excited,‚Äù she continues blabbering. Jean feels a light pain in her forehead.  
  
Jean looks at the attractive man in the polo. He stares back, examining her face with detail. Worry paints his face.   
  
‚ÄúHe did it again, didn‚Äôt he?‚Äù He says with an exhausted sigh. ‚ÄúWhy do you do this to yourself?‚Äù   
  
Jean feels embarrassed. She had tried to hide the evidence with makeup, but clearly very poorly. She looks down, too shy to make eye contact.  
  
‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt hit you again, did he?‚Äù Nick asks, rolling up his sleeve like he‚Äôs going to fight someone.   
  
‚ÄúJames is a good guy,‚Äù Jean whispers, ‚ÄúDeep down, I know he can change. He‚Äôs been nice before.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThe only change you see is a facade, a lie, to keep you there. Have you even read the book I gave you?‚Äù James replies quickly, frustrated.

Jean takes a deep breath, trying to calm herself.  
  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because he can see the person you truly are. He unmasked you, and you couldn‚Äôt turn him against me. I didn‚Äôt understand the stuff he said about you, but now I do.‚Äù Jean argues.  
  
‚ÄúWhat am I to you, huh?‚Äù James asks in anger. ‚ÄúBecause all I‚Äôm seeing now is a faceless whore who doesn‚Äôt listen to the man of the house!‚Äù  
  
Jean is shocked by his comment, but fights back. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the Devil incarnate in my eyes. You make my life a living hell. Now get out!‚Äù  
  
They both stand there. Jean slows her breathing, thinking he‚Äôs about to leave. She doesn‚Äôt look away from James. He takes a step back and looks around the room before looking Jean up and down. He starts taking quick breaths as pure rage distorts his face. They lock eyes, and Jean‚Äôs heart drops.  
  
‚ÄúYou Bitch!‚Äù He musters before taking a quick step forward, raising his arms towards Jean‚Äôs neck. Both of his hands are tightly wrapped around Jean‚Äôs throat. He throws profanities and spit around the room as he yells. Jean flails her arms, contacting James‚Äôs arms in the process. He doesn‚Äôt flinch.  
  
‚ÄúThis is what I get for being your boyfriend? I spent my free time getting ready for you today after work. I did that even though you spilled that wine!‚Äù James howls, gripping slightly harder with every word.  
  
Jean‚Äôs face starts to turn a pale blue. Her eyes seem to almost pop out of her head. She‚Äôs lifted off the ground, allowing her to kick James in his gut. They both drop to the ground with a loud thud. Jean‚Äôs attempts to breathe again are interrupted by burning coughs. James regains his bearings and gets on top of Jean.  
  
‚ÄúYou were so easy to control.‚Äù  
  
A throbbing pain fills her left cheek as James throws a punch.  
  
‚ÄúYou were only good for the loving and my laundry.‚Äù  
  
Her jaw takes the next blow, then the side of her head.   
  
‚ÄúI just had to sit and let you do everything.‚Äù  
  
One punch after another. One taunt after another. She screams as blood starts flowing down her face. She tries kicking and punching to no avail.  
  
Minutes of beating go by like hours. James stands up and looks at the carnage ‚Äî His carnage. He spits in her face as he inspects his bloodied knuckles. He shows no sign of remorse. No sign of regret. Just a face twisted with pure rage.   
  
Pounding at the front door replaces James‚Äôs anger with panic. The explosion of wood and the door hitting the wall are heard as James sprints to another room. Jean‚Äôs eyes roll back into her head as she goes unconscious.  
  
Fire engulfs her, yet a chill flows through her body. Memories in the shape of small pictures fall from the open sky. They crackle as the fire consumes them. Jean catches one. It shows the cuts along her wrists; It burns in her hands, flying up as it turns to ash  
  
She catches another. A blurred arm screams towards the photo‚Äôs point of view. That too burns and levitates up.  
  
Jean stands for hours, looking over the thousands of falling photos. No emotion comes over her; A blank face is all she can express in the precipitation of snapshots.  
  
The photos start falling in smaller quantities until one lone painted rectangle falls. She catches it in the palms of her hands. A red tint blurs the image of James running into another room. It sits in her palms, staying intact, unlike the rest of the prints. She grips each corner and tears the snapshot. As soon as the paper rips in two, a white light engulfs her entire body.  
  
A looming buzz of fluorescent lights and a rhythmic beeping fills Jean‚Äôs ears as she gains consciousness. A nurse rushes in and begins to prepare some equipment. Jean slowly and strenuously props herself up as the nurse checks her vitals.   
  
‚ÄúHow are you feeling, dear?‚Äù the nurse asks in a slight southern accent.   
  
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some people here to visit you! I‚Äôll go get them from the waiting room, okay, honey?‚Äù The nurse rubs Jean‚Äôs shoulder before speeding out of the room.  
  
A half-dozen pairs of heavy clunking footsteps come down the hall towards Jean‚Äôs door. Nick appears surrounded by 5 police officers. He grabs the nearby chair and sits down close to the bed. Jean inspects Nick‚Äôs face. His eyes are red and puffy with purple-ish bags under them. Nick takes a shaky breath of air.  
  
‚ÄúI was so worried. I got a call and they told me what happened,‚Äù Expresses Nick. He grabs Jean's hand with both of his and holds them tight to his face. His shaky breath is the only thing Jean can focus on. A voice is drowned out by her focus. One of the officers clears his throat, and Jean‚Äôs attention shifts.   
  
The officer speaks in a professional tone. ‚ÄúExcuse me, miss, we need to ask you a few questions about what happened last night.‚Äù  
  
The beeping gets faster, and Jean‚Äôs head starts spinning. Her deep breaths are replaced by sharp, shallow ones. She relives the moment and winces at each punch that plays in her head. Her eyes dart around the room before being clouded by thick tears.  
  
Everyone gets a look of panic, and a few officers rush out of the room down the hall. They return with the nurse and another man in a long white coat. The coat reminds Jean of her white couch and the wine stain, which just makes her cry harder.  
  
The officer repeats his question, trying to ignore the panic attack happening in front of him. The nurse glares at him and ushers the officers out of the room. The man in the long coat kneels down to Jean‚Äôs eye level.  
  
A calming voice floats over the room. ‚ÄúDo you think you can take a nice, deep breath for me?‚Äù   
  
Jean closes her eyes and slows her shaky breathing. In. Out. She repeats this, each breath slowing the beating in her chest. She opens her eyes.  
  
‚ÄúWe will leave you two alone for a bit until you are ready.‚Äù The man says. He and the nurse walk out of the room, shutting the curtain and glass door behind them.  
  
Jean relaxes her body and lies back on the bed. She looks at Nick to her left and puts her right hand on his cheek. She feels his shaky breaths in her fingertips. They sit like this for a minute.  
  
‚ÄúThank you for waiting,‚Äù she says, forming a smile. Straining the fresh stitches woven through her head. She asks Nick, ‚ÄúHow long?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here for ‚Äî‚Äù He looks at his wristwatch. ‚Äú14 hours.‚Äù  
  
Tears start streaming down Jean‚Äôs face. Nick leans into a tight hug. She presses her face into his chest. A growing warmth floods her body. She hugs tighter, and so does he. The fire in her heart cools.  
  
Her voice is muffled as she speaks. ‚ÄúI should have listened to you sooner.‚Äù She begins wailing and bawling even harder.  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre stubborn, but you can‚Äôt change people like him.‚Äù  
  
Jean sits up and playfully punches Nick in the chest in retaliation for the ‚Äòstubborn‚Äô comment, laughing through her tears. Nick hands her a handful of nearby tissues that Jean uses to wipe her face and nose with. The pair sits there for a while, laughing and staring at each other.   
  
Nick gets up and walks to the door. He calls over the officers with a wave. They surround the bed, overwhelming Jean slightly, but she is ready to talk.  
  
‚ÄúSorry about that, ma‚Äôam. I am Detective Evans. We have arrested James as of last night. Your neighbor called the police after hearing screams. We need your account to press charges.‚Äù He pulls out a notepad and flips it open, ready to write.  
  
Jean relives last night. She stares blankly at a wall as she explains what happened.  
  
‚ÄúHe grabbed me.‚Äù She says, touching her neck.  
  
Jean looks at Nick and grabs his hand as she proceeds to go through yesterday's events. Each one makes her heart race, but she calms down when Nick tightens his grip on her hand.  
  
When the interrogation is finished, the cops leave, thanking Jean on the way out. The nurse comes in, the man in the coat trailing behind her.  
  
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have y‚Äôall out of here in a bit, just a few more minutes as the doc signs some papers.‚Äù Says the nurse through a cheerful smile. Her bright mood is contagious.  
  
‚ÄúPraise God your jaw didn‚Äôt break. A miracle that is, with the beating you took.‚Äù She says, impressed, before leaving the room with some papers.  
  
Jean slides out of bed with Nick‚Äôs help. Her first few steps are stiff, so she wraps her arm around Nick, and he does the same. With discharge papers in one hand and Nick's waist in the other, they walk out of the hospital.  
  
Jean leans her head on Nick‚Äôs chest. At the same time, a huge weight dissolves from her shoulders. She takes one last deep breath to finally extinguish the hate in her heart.",3,1759465695.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1nwpisd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1nwpisd/sharing_some_win/,Sharing some Win,"Just throught I would drop in and share some recent wins;

Have been trying this ""dirty fasting"" thing; alternate fasting days with normal eating days, but fasting days still allow a morning coffee, an apple for lunch, and a protien bar before bed - it's about not hating yourself. So far dropped about 1kg/week and feeling pretty good about keeping it going.

I've managed to take my dogs on multiple walks over the past two weeks, something i've not managed for months. It has helped to have increased painkillers, and my Staffy X Shepherd **hauls** my ass along. Then the recovery has only been about a day of increased grief afterward, in the past it would have been 3-5 days of grief.

Wife and I took the kids to the Royal Show yesterday, we did it all day and I managed to walk it with just my cane and ""pop-up tripod stool"" and *lots of rest stops*. Even managed to only eat two dagwood dogs and thats it, just wasnt feeling the need to partake in the junk food (when normally at the Show i would be a bit silly and eat **all** the things!)  
I'm in a bit of pain today, but way less than i expected and planned for.

Going to take the dogs for another walk tomorrow to try and hold the momentum.

Would love to hear some wins others have been having!?  
Sending out much love & look after yourselves!",5,1759465430.0,ChronicPain,0,1.0,False
1nwpih8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DubaiCoffeeLovers/comments/1nwpih8/one_hour_queues_dubais_coffee_shops_become_trendy/,One Hour Queues: Dubai‚Äôs Coffee Shops Become Trendy Hotspots,"Dubai's coffee culture is reaching new heights: at the city's most popular coffee shops, queues and waitlists have become the new normal. As the weather cooled, locals and tourists flocked to trendy venues to enjoy the ambiance, catch up with friends, and of course, post aesthetic shots on social media. At some spots, like Lune Lounge, guests wait in their cars from 20 minutes to an hour‚Äîmany say it's just part of the fun!

The incredible buzz comes not only from great weather, but also thanks to influencers and even royal family members who frequent such places, driving even greater popularity. Caf√© owners say that when influencer friends show up with a camera, hundreds of new guests want to join the ""waitlist."" For many, the main goal is to get that perfect Instagram story and share the moment with friends, feeling part of a trendy community. UAE coffee lovers spend 800‚Äì1300 AED per month on coffee, often picking venues based on social reputation rather than price.

In response, caf√©s are rolling out new apps: now customers can pre-order drinks, send coffee as a gift, or track wait times through their mobile‚Äîeverything to speed up service and make the experience even more enjoyable. Dubai proves that coffee is not just a drink, but a lifestyle and a symbol of contemporary urban culture.",1,1759465399.0,DubaiCoffeeLovers,0,1.0,False
