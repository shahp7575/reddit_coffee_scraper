I’m looking for advice on how to process this situation. My (26F) now ex-boyfriend (26M) and I were together for almost nine years. We started dating in February 2016, and the breakup officially happened on December 16th, 2024.
The breakup stemmed from a fight we had on December 13th. I told him I wanted to break up during an argument, but I didn’t mean it and took it back immediately. The next day, I wanted to apologize and talk things through, but he told me he didn’t want to be in a relationship anymore. He said the past year had been difficult for him, and he felt:
 • I didn’t like him because I was overly critical. 
 • I wasn’t supportive enough when it came to his degree (I was unsure what career paths it would open up because his explanations were vague). 
 • I didn’t move in with him because I couldn’t afford it. He wanted to pay for both of us, but he had just lost his job, and I didn’t feel comfortable with him covering everything. 
 • The final straw was when I gave him an ultimatum to ""make realistic life plans for the future or lose me."" I know that was wrong of me and deeply regret it. 

The breakup was painful but somewhat understandable given the context. However, here’s where I feel hurt and disrespected. I recently found out that the Friday of our fight (the day I initially said I wanted to break up), he told a friend he thought a girl from his university was “cute” and “pretty.”
By the following Wednesday (five days after the fight and two days after the official breakup), he texted his friend saying, “I’m head over heels” and “I feel like I’m 15 again” after having a 30-minute conversation with her. She suggested they grab coffee, and he asked his friend when he should make the move to ask her out. He eventually asked her to grab coffee on January 1st, 2025.
He insists it’s “just coffee” and not a date, and that he isn’t pursuing a new relationship. However, to me, if you feel “head over heels” about someone and you ask them to grab a coffee, it sounds like you want something to happen.
What makes it worse is that when we talked after the breakup, he promised that there was no one else. I had my suspicions and asked him directly, even specifically about that girl, but he denied everything. He later admitted he didn’t want to tell me he had a crush on someone else because he didn’t want me to think that was the reason he ended our relationship.
I understand I wasn’t perfect in our relationship, and I accept that my actions contributed to its end. But after nearly nine years together, I hoped he would’ve taken more time before pursuing someone else... or at least shown more respect to what we had.
I feel like this timeline is too quick and disrespectful to our relationship. I feel hurt by how quickly he moved on. How do I process these feelings and make peace with this situation?

TLDR: After almost nine years together, my ex ended our relationship on December 16th, 2024. On the same day as our fight, he told a friend he thought a girl from his university was cute. Days later, he admitted to being “head over heels” for her and arranged to grab coffee with her. He claims it’s “just coffee” and not a date, but I feel hurt by how quickly he moved on. How do I process these feelings and make peace with this situation?",2,1735999360.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False
1htez0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1htez0v/networking_like_a_pro_building_genuine_connections/,Networking Like a Pro: Building Genuine Connections,"When it comes to networking, I like to think of it not as a corporate game of chess but more like a laid-back coffee chat with a friend. You know, the kind of conversation where you spill your secrets, not just the usual ""what do you do?"" stuff. So, here are some tips on how to network authentically and how it has really given my business a boost.

**1. Be Yourself – No 'Corporate Robot' Allowed**  
Here’s the thing: if you’re not being yourself, then why even bother? People can sniff out fakeness from a mile away. When I started showing up as my true, slightly awkward self – the one who trips over their own words and sometimes mixes up their metaphors – that’s when connections started to flourish. Authenticity creates trust, and trust leads to opportunities. Just last week, I had a conversation with someone who appreciated my quirky sense of humor. We ended up collaborating, and the rest is history!

**2. Listen More Than You Speak**  
It’s tempting to jump into your own elevator pitch, but let’s face it: no one wants to endure a monologue. So, be the friend who lends an ear. When you actively listen to others, you’re not only showing genuine interest, but you’re also gathering nuggets of wisdom that could help your own journey. I once learned about a unique audience engagement idea simply because I was curious about someone else’s work. Their suggestion? Goldmine for my business.

**3. Offer Help Without a Hidden Agenda**  
Networking is often approached with a ""What’s in it for me?"" mentality. Let me just say this: if you want to build strong relationships, flip that script. Be the person who genuinely wants to help. Whether that’s sharing a resource, making a connection, or just offering a word of encouragement, it pays off. Those good vibes come back tenfold. I once reached out to someone just to offer them a tip about a challenge they were facing. Fast forward a month, and they referred a client to me. Amazing how kindness can create ripples, right?

**4. Follow Up – Don’t Let the Good Vibes Fade**  
So, you’ve had a great chat over coffee (or maybe it was a virtual Zoom with a questionable background). What do you do next? Follow up! Whether it’s a quick email saying how much you enjoyed your conversation or sharing an article that reminded you of them, this small gesture keeps the connection alive. I remember sending a random email to a contact about a funny podcast episode we both enjoy. Next thing I know, we’re brainstorming potential joint ventures. Networking can be this wildly serendipitous adventure if you let it.

**5. Join a Community**  
Find groups that align with your interests, whether it’s through social media, local meetups, or church communities. Getting involved in a shared mission not only enhances your network but also bolsters personal growth. I’ve met some of my most supportive friends through various community projects, and many of them have become collaborators in my business.

These tips are not foolproof—there's no magic formula here—but they’ve definitely changed the game for me. Networking isn’t solely about the connections you make; it’s about the relationships you cultivate over time. The opportunities that arise are just the cherry on top of an already fulfilling experience of sharing genuine moments and stories with others.

So, how about you? How can you start connecting authentically in your own circles? Are you ready to embrace the messiness of life and the beauty of community? If you ask me, that’s the way to thrive—business-wise and life-wise.",1,1735999300.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

I’m 21, an ambitious businessman who's hustled my way through the world of e-commerce and exports. I don't come from a business family, but I’ve always had a thing for turning ideas into profit:

2023: Flipped to export-import, bagged ₹2L.
2024: Back to e-commerce with better capital, scaled ₹2L to ₹12L.

I know Facebook Ads inside out and was curious if I could use those skills to help sell properties, especially in Tier 1 cities. But I need insights: How’s the market? What’s working? What isn’t?

Collecting cookies is my favourite part of the game. Seeing the animals interact with the furniture from dancing at a ball to bathing in a luxurious spa really makes the game so much fun. It made me actually sit down and realize how much animals weren’t given a cookie. So I made one for every animal that was missing one.

I can’t drawn, sadly, I have been told I can write, so I will describe the idea as best as possible and I hope it’s enough.

**If you have a idea for a villager cookie, especially those I couldn’t think of, or have a better idea, or a addition to a idea, dont hesitate to comment! Thank you!**

Hey hey welcome to the new list of animal crossing forgotten villagers cookies! We had already a lot of ideas from fellow fans and they are amazing. Why are they so amazing? Well, because you guys think differently then me. We are all different humans with different interests and that makes, the best cookies because that way villagers get cookies with themes I could never think of.  All humans are different, and so are the villagers! So, thank you, everyone that suggested a cookie theme! Your name will be written in the credits of said cookie with your idea. 

Changes made: Alice had already a cookie. Her idea has been given to Naomi. Ike now has a customized cookie. Typos of villager names are now changed. Curlos the sheep who was previously forgotten now not only makes the list but also has a customed cookie. Penelope has a customed cookie. Pietro has now a customed cookie. Edited some ideas to be more specific about cookies for example Tucker and changed Gonzo's idea entirely.

Admiral= Admiral. The only idea I had for admiral was going to be a old vintage wooden ship, and uhm a bit pirates of the caribbean like, but from the bad guys (so i guess the navy) p.o.v xD. There would be wigs and spy glasses you can hold in your hand and map rugs and villagers can spin the world globe…which wasnt invented yet but shhh. (that was around that time when folks realized, hold up, this thing is round not flat)

Agent S=Agent S is i think a perfect fit for undercover stuff. So think about gadgets. Villagers can fly with a jetpack, they can roll under lasers at the 5 star vault to break in so to speak, and there are some sleek outfits in this collection. Inspired by totally spies and action movies alike, this set is sure to blow your socks off. (not literally)

AI=Al’s binge cookie. Cuddle up with a cozy blanket, and expierence home comfort like never before with the Binge cookie. Watching series is what he does best, so expect comfortable new media inspired pyjamas (k.k slyder on the print, or the iconic animal crossing leaf pattern) a popcorn maker and a soda machine. There’s also a lounge couch where six villagers can sit on, so you can gather together to watch that one show with your favourite friends!

Alli=Alli is a fairytale cookie from the fairytale of the snow queen. Picture a new snowy dress, a snow castle made of ice and handheld items that let your villagers cast real ice magic. You can also imagine the colours blue, purple, and dark green to be used a lot.

Anabella=Anabella would like to open her own bed and breakfast! You can now collect parts of her cozy furniture and decorate your campsite to fit the theme. The furniture will mostly be british countryside based with mostly white and beige colours, new kitchenette items like cooking stoves but also fitting decorations to make that bed and breakfast look amazing. You can expect two new outfits for the owner and can give villagers now small suitcases or bags depending on your preference. 

Anchovy=Anchovy’s fishy cookie. It comes with fishing furniture. Based on fishes, so you can have a sea bass table and a octopus chair. The outfits are fish onesies you can wear and the 5 star item is this large, aquarium that stands on the floor and villagers can kinda, hang above it a bit, leaning, looking into the water and smile at the fishes.

Angus= Angus Beef. He should get a cookie that allows you to and I am sorry for all cow villagers, open up a beef restaurant. It would not come with anything bloody, but imagine lovely rustic chairs and tables, with plaid tablecloths and lovely little glasses. It would be very cute. The 5 star cookie reward would be a mechanical bull your villagers can ride.  

Anicotti=Anicotti’s fashion boutique. This set is more about making clothes, rather then selling them like Bree’s lovely cookie. You will see villagers sewing at the tables, size each other up with size measurement labels and can expect some true True Jackson shenigagns from this cookie xD. (man that show was so long ago but so good) 5 star cookie reward will be a office table where your villagers can have a meeting, imagine space for 8 villagers max and you as the boss will stand beside it. It will be great for mulitple story telling purposes. Fashion is not unimportant as the outfits will be Anicotti approved.

Ankha=Travel back to Ankha’s time with this unique cookie. Ankha has recently found a portal and has begun importing goods and clothing from her time. The villagers can be dressed in beautiful linen (common in that time) usually in white colours with bright gems and jewerly details (not so common, at least not for everyone) Imagine a sphinx statue that your villagers can talk to (it wont say much but sometimes they get a either ‘’blessed’’ or a ‘’cursed’’ face from it) The reward is a classical Feluccas. these beautiful boats have sailed the seas since the ancient times and can host up to 6 different villagers, all with different interactions. Someone will wave, another will raise a glass, and two are doing the famous titanic ‘’I am the king of the world’’ scene. xD  I have much love and appreciation for (Ancient) Egypt and I really tried to keep this respectful and accurate. I hope so, at least.  Except the titanic scene but thats just..that had to be there.xD

Annalise=Annelise’s cookie is going to be a hit for bridgerton fans. Shock, and delight, indeed my friends. The carriage is the 5 star reward that takes up around twenty space. ‘’WHAT SO MUCH?!’’ Yeah, because it drives around, in a small circle. The dresses are inspired by the netflix hit show but it wont be a official collab. I don’t know how the area is called but I do know its after Elizabeth I and before Elizabeth II XD. So, imagine ballgowns, uhm, dance floors in a more natural colour, high hats for gentlemen villagers, cakes that rotates and it opens and butterflies come out of it, as the villagers clap, and you have a podium where a villager can stand on, and up to six villagers can kneel around the stage, as if its a coronation. You can also change their emotions to make them look angry to make it look like a uprising xD. Just something I thought of. Yeah. Cute cookie:)

Antonio=Antonio’s run. Antonio’s cookie is going to be inspired by a pretty big sport events; Marathons. Imagine little fences, two kinds. You have one where two villagers can stand behind (imagine mom Annalisa and dad Julian cheering on their kid Filbert) ((ignore genetics, this is a example)) or one fence where one villager stands behind (awh, grandpa dobie came out to watch his grandson filbert! how cute!) the outfits will be two different sport outfits each with fitting numbers on the back like the person is actually participating in a marathon. You can also hold sports drinks. The special item is a ten spaces big running space where five villagers can run in, while three villagers cheer. It also comes with a villager with a camera doing a photo finish. ‘’...they use computers, nowadays…kath…’’ yeah, i know but imagine how cute it would be!! xD

The 5 star item will be a bone related item where the player can summon visions with the bones. Imagine a spooky, skeleton set for this cookie. Not too much like we had, like its a shade darker. Maybe too dark, but I’ll leave that up to you.

He wants to know what the hype is about so he decided: Let me open my own store that way I’ll surely learn. Nope. xD.

If it can make a difference, its worth the try)

I have made up two concepts for the Sheep and whatever you like best is what we do. If you have any adjustions or ideas let me know, and I'll happily change things. It was your idea, after all! I was thinking on doing something food related like the name Curlos reminded me of churros for some reason. This is according to Google a Spanish snack that can tie into the tropical theme you'd like to have. Maybe it can be part of a Spanish restaurant cookie or maybe a street vendor cookie with all sort of food stands set in a street or market. I was also thinking there could be special dance spots where villagers could dance the flamingo which is a Spanish dance and there could be Spanish handheld dishes. But this is just all if you want the Spanish theme, of course xD. If not, we'll look further for something else.

Claudia=She has her own bridal boutique cookie. You can pick out wedding dresses here. The items are in slight blush pink and very pale white. There is this pedestal where a villager will stand on and try on dresses. You can assign a crying couch to it (comes with the cookie) so that it looks like the villager’s entourage is so moved by their beautiful dress that they had to shed a tear..or just sob. xD

The red shoes are placeable and wearable, (two different pairs, but it will look the same pair) if villagers chooses to interact, they will dance with these shoes, and dance a long time.

Ike= ''if i could suggest one, maybe for Ike, he could have a mechanic shop/garage cookie if one doesn't exist already :) his homes are usually garage themed, so it would make sense, some items could be tires, cars, and toolbeds and then the premium 5 star could be a car suspended in the air or something like that :)''-**Darius'**s idea for Ike's cookie. Good idea, Darius! I'd like to go even further into your idea and add the following items and options. Maybe we can add a car that villagers can work on, as if its being repaired. The car you mentioned can indeed be the 5 star premium item and maybe an animal can lower it via the system and smile as if they just finished making the car. We can also add in clothing to fit the garage and maybe some oil stains from gasoline on the clothing to give it a truly unique vibe.

Penelope=  Redditor **Soggyglump** made a amazing idea for Penelope's cookie. They wrote. ''Penelope's beautiful bow cookie. Just pink. And ribbons. Everywhere. The 5 star item is a big. ass. bow.'' Thank you for your comment, Soggyglump! I like this idea because like the other suggestions you paid attention to what Penelope really likes and is about and the bow is a big part of her identiy. I like to add two themes for the cookies with your preference deciding what cookie theme is the best and if they're not your vibe what we could change. The first cookie idea I had was 17th century French ballroom. Very gilded with tons of bows on the dresses and bows everywhere on the furniture. The premium item would be a big bow which also would serve as a throne. The other idea is more modern and would feature modern but cute like pink coloured furniture with bows on them. It would fit well into modern homes alike. The big bow in this case can be a fishtank or a slide for villagers to use or maybe a tv. Let me know what you like best or if you have any other ideas yourself!

Pierce=

Pietro=Pietro's cookie. **Redditor sehotonin wrote:** '' I just need a clown/mime cookie! Not necessarily circus, but clown as in balloon things, a pie in the hand to throw, clown or mime makeup, cool clown statues/dolls. Could also be slightly spooky!'' The cookie idea is very good as I like that the idea of the circus is taking a slight step back and we focus truly on what Pietro is about. He's a clown sheep. I love the cake throwing idea, and the make-up ideas. This cookie will be amazing. I was thinking we can add the cake throwing in a two villager interactions where two villagers stand and one throws the cake and the other is the victim xD. I was also thinking a balloon making interaction could be used by villagers where they briefly make a balloon animal and than they put it away. A lovely idea for a lovely sheep!

Tangy: Tangy’s Orange cookie: The idea is familiar to Merge’s but instead of strawberries we use oranges here. Imagine town builds made of oranges and decorated with cute delicious details. There is also a orange onesie. Because Orange juice is less thick than strawberry juice (or because I didn’t think of this sooner) there will be orange baths available where villagers can bathe in orange juice. They can harvest oranges from interactable trees, and even gift oranges to one another.

Tex: Tex’s texting cookie: Introduce your villagers to painful thumbs and learn them how to take selfies in this cookie that brings smartphones uhm, NookPhones to your villagers! Villagers can be assigned a phone via the clothing section, but can’t interact with it. There are different furniture pieces that will allow them to pull out a phone and use it even if you didn’t give your villagers a phone. For example there is now a dinner table where everyone can be using their phone. Wow. This might be the most realistic idea I had yet… And a couch where two villagers are texting each other, smiling and cackling with joy. And there is also a romantic dinner table where two villagers now use their phone instead of looking at each other. Aw:(. Of course there is also a circle spotlight where villagers can telephone, and even a small walking space so they can walk around and chat with whoever’s calling them.

Is the Breville Barista Express Espresso Machine Worth the Hype? A Deep Dive Review

The Breville Barista Express has become a staple in many home baristas’ kitchens, promising cafe-quality espresso without the cafe price tag. But does it live up to the hype? This in-depth review delves into the machine's design, features, performance, and limitations to help you decide if it's the right espresso machine for you.

## Design and Build Quality: A Solid Foundation for Espresso Excellence

The Breville Barista Express boasts a robust build, primarily constructed from stainless steel.  Available in Black Sesame and Brushed Stainless Steel, its 13.25"""" x 16"""" x 12"""" dimensions and substantial weight convey a sense of durability and quality.  This isn't a lightweight machine; it feels solid and built to last, a crucial factor for a machine that will likely see daily use.

## Functionality and Features:  A Comprehensive Espresso Solution

The Barista Express isn't just aesthetically pleasing; it’s packed with features designed to streamline the espresso-making process.  Let's break down its key functionalities:

### The Integrated Grinder: Precision at Your Fingertips

The built-in conical burr grinder is a significant selling point, offering 16 grind size settings for precise control over your espresso extraction.  A grind amount knob allows you to adjust the quantity of grounds, ensuring consistency. However, it's important to acknowledge a limitation: the grinder's conical burr design, while reliable, might not offer the same level of precision as some higher-end flat burr grinders found in more expensive machines.  This can lead to potential channeling issues if the grind isn't perfectly even.

### Thermojet Heating System: Speed and Consistency

Breville's Thermojet heating system is a standout feature, reaching optimal extraction temperature in approximately 30 seconds. This rapid heating contributes to efficiency and reduces wait times between shots.  The PID temperature control ensures consistent water temperature throughout the brewing process, crucial for achieving optimal espresso extraction.  While incredibly fast, it's worth noting that some users report a slightly slower group head temperature rise compared to other ThermoJet systems.


### Low-Pressure Infusion:  A Gentle Approach to Extraction

The low-pressure pre-infusion feature gently saturates the coffee grounds before the main extraction begins.  This technique helps to ensure even extraction, reducing channeling and maximizing flavor development.

### Additional Convenient Features: Enhancing the Experience

Beyond the core espresso-making capabilities, the Barista Express offers several convenient features:

* **Hot Water Spout:** Perfect for preparing Americanos or long blacks.
* **360-Degree Swivel Steam Wand with Built-in Assist Handle:** This allows for easy milk frothing with various techniques and helps prevent accidental burns.
* **Programmable Volumetrics:**  Allows you to customize shot volumes for consistency.
* **Auto-Purge Function:** Automatically returns the machine to optimal temperature after use.
* **Razor Dosing Tool:** Assists in achieving a level tamp for consistent espresso extraction.


## Performance and Capabilities:  Delivering on the Promise

The Breville Barista Express consistently delivers high-quality espresso. The adjustable settings allow for fine-tuning to your preferences, whether you prefer a bolder or more nuanced flavor profile.  The machine excels in producing excellent microfoam for lattes and cappuccinos, thanks to its efficient steam wand. The 54mm portafilter is a standard size, compatible with most readily available accessories.

## Ease of Use and Maintenance:  Intuitive Operation and Simple Cleaning

The Barista Express boasts an intuitive user interface, with clearly labeled buttons and dials.  Indicator lights provide helpful feedback, although some users find them a bit too bright.  The cleaning process is relatively straightforward, with a cleaning indication light reminding you when maintenance is needed.  Regular cleaning and descaling are essential for maintaining optimal performance.


## Comparison with Other Machines:  Finding Your Perfect Match

The Breville Barista Express competes in a crowded market of home espresso machines.  Compared to other Breville machines with the ThermoJet system, the Barista Express offers a more integrated experience, combining grinding and brewing in one unit. However, other dedicated machines might offer superior steam pressure, or a more advanced grinder.  When compared to other hybrid espresso machines in a similar price range, the Barista Express often stands out due to its ease of use and its combination of features.  However, the limitations of its integrated grinder and slightly lower steam pressure compared to dedicated machines should be considered.

## Pain Points and Addressing Concerns:  Understanding the Limitations

While the Breville Barista Express is a fantastic machine, it's not without its limitations:

* **Grinder Limitations:** The conical burr grinder, while functional, might not be as efficient or precise as higher-end flat burr grinders, potentially leading to channeling in extraction.
* **Steam Pressure:** The steam pressure is lower than dedicated milk frothers, meaning creating extremely textured microfoam might require some practice.
* **Simultaneous Operation:** While the machine switches seamlessly between espresso and steaming functions, you cannot steam milk and pull a shot simultaneously.


## Value for Money:  Weighing the Investment

The Breville Barista Express sits comfortably in the sub-$1000 price range.  Considering its features, build quality, and performance, it represents excellent value for money for home baristas who want a convenient all-in-one solution.  While more expensive machines may offer superior performance in specific areas, the Barista Express provides a well-rounded experience that is difficult to beat at its price point.


## Conclusion:  A Solid Choice for the Aspiring Home Barista

The Breville Barista Express is a strong contender in the home espresso machine market. Its ease of use, comprehensive feature set, and ability to produce excellent espresso and milk foam make it an attractive option for coffee enthusiasts of all skill levels.  While it has some limitations, particularly concerning the integrated grinder and steam pressure, these shortcomings are largely outweighed by its overall performance and user-friendliness.  If you're looking for a reliable, versatile, and relatively easy-to-use espresso machine without breaking the bank, the Breville Barista Express is definitely worth considering.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I use pre-ground coffee with the Breville Barista Express?**

A: While the machine is designed for use with whole beans, you can use pre-ground coffee in a pinch. However, the quality of your espresso will likely suffer due to the lack of control over grind size.

**Q: How often do I need to descale the Breville Barista Express?**

A: Descaling frequency depends on your water hardness and usage.  Consult your machine's manual for specific recommendations, but generally, descaling every 3-6 months is advisable.

**Q: What type of milk is best for frothing with the steam wand?**

A: Cold, whole milk generally produces the best results.  Avoid using ultra-pasteurized milk, as it tends to be harder to froth.

I have a fairly cold kitchen and quartz counters so nothing holds heat very well (my hot coffee is cold within 15 minutes).

I'm a site supervisor for a mid sized company that has a network of mid sized companies we work with. I'm not above helping a fellow company out if it gets my guys hours but lately it's been more hassle then it's worth. Between the top three brass in our company we have close to 80 years combined experience but that means nothing if we do not get clear ideas of what the scope of the work involved. One of the companies we work with has turned into a head hunting firm finding jobs then turning it over to other  companies to man. That's great they take a finders fee get us jobs every one wins. Till they do not get information on the jobs actual requirements or even locations. The customer then looks at me like I should know everything when many times I do not even have the proper address or knowledge of the site. 
Example one: get dispatched  towhat I belive is a local food packaging facility. Do my due diligence  get paid extra for last minute staffing because middle man company called 24 hours before we have to report. Location I was given has no knowledge  of us being needed. Call middle manager  3 hours later he calls back with correct location and company. 10 miles apart and is a seed storage facility  no way related to first company. Make contact with contractor needing our services. I was told 3 days 12 hour shifts nights is what I was told by middle man. Contractor states its 3 days 24 hour manned post  mandatory. One 18 hour shift for my self later I got relief to get 6 hours of rest report back for night coverage and my partner was able to cover days after. 
Example 2 got contracted by same middle man to cover a art gallery. Arrive on scene to discover it's a 3 block festival and we only had 2 guards and free booze tokens being handed out. We were responsible  for watching for gate crashers in addition to our gallery duties.


Long story short we have adopted a policy of interviewing clients to find what best fits their needs. We will never be the cheapest because we care about quality. We are no where near the most expensive in our area but we strive to be the most knowledgeable in our area. Both of the above jobs have now completely cut out middle manager for future jobs because we had a sit down and explained how we could provide open communication and a quality product for them. I will go hungry rather then provide a inferior service. If you do not want to pay our price for the servicees you need then we have competition that would love to provide what you want. (Just remember it costs more to fix problems down the line) When asked why we charge what we do I make it a point to show my customers the rules and regulations I have to follow and show the quality means you pay a little more now so you don't have to pay a lot later and possibly even pay in human life.

There was an L shape layout with tables around the outside, a counter with lots of large Nutella containers, and then crepe making spots in the square area behind the counter. 

The food was fast, affordable, and delicious. They did sweet and savory crepes and maybe some coffee and that was about it from what I remember. 

There was an older gentleman working the counter who I took for the owner, and a younger guy that worked there as well.

ADHD meds worsened sleep and psychosis, they were stopped. Food intolerance tests were inconclusive. GI suspects gluten intolerance despite milk issues. Back problems (including 3 varied back fractures) possibly hinting at gluten intolerance based osteoporosis. Seeking help.


34 / M / from India / BMI 34+ / diagnosis of Asperger's and ADHD

I have strange gut issues and I don't know why

It started around April after I quit my job on leap day Feb 2024. (March was my birthday month so it doesn't count 😝)

I had gastroparesis like symptoms: heartburn, pain in the upper stomach, bloating, farting, feeling like stomach grew smaller etc

I reduced my meal size and increased my meal frequency.

Then I was diagnosed with ADHD and I was put on Atomoxetine (SNRI) 10mg, then titrated to 18mg, but later down to 9mg due to psychosis like symptoms qnd poor sleep caused by excess adrenaline.

I ate normally while on those meds. Then when I stopped them, I started having violent episodes of diarrhoea and I couldn't understand why. I did some experiments and realized it's happening after consuming milk and spicy foods to a lesser extent. 

I went to a GI and he said it's probably food poisoning and put me on 5 days course of Rifaximin 400 (antibiotic) and VSL 3 (for refilling the lost bacteria). 

But even after 2 rounds of the same set of medications, nothing changed. 

I switched to a new more expensive GI.

I told him my symptoms and he recommended a stool routine, occult blood, and a H pylori antigen test (the last one was on my request as I was doubting that)

I also had food intolerance test when switching from GI no 1 to GI no 2. (None of the GI's was named Joe).

All tests came back negative. 

Meanwhile, in real life, the pattern of diarrhoea post milk hasn't changed. So my chai and cappuccino have been replaced with black tea and coffee (and I hate it!).

A pattern with brown bread/multigrain brown bread has also surfaced. 

So my GI no 2 said it's most likely gluten induced intolerance. But then why is it happening with milk? It never happened with  curd (yoghurt) or buttermilk but it has started happening with that also. 

What about Jowar (sorghum)? Yes, diarrhoea triggered with that also.

During this course, I had severe back pain and the MRI revealed several disc bulges and degenerative changes, one Grade 1 retrolisthesis, and 3 different backbone fractures.

I say this in the context of gluten intolerance causing osteoporosis.

I'm treating those with an ortho and a physio. My physiotherapist said my hams got tight and my back muscles spasmed to protect the backbone. 

I'm really worried. Can anybody (especially GI's) shine light on these symptoms? ",1,1735997938.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

It's a hearty culture (even survived accidentally adding baking soda to it a few years ago) that originated from a now 20 year-old Alaskan starter that my friend bakes with at a B&B.
I moved over a year ago to a place with well water, and I haven't made a successful loaf since the move. I initially chalked it up to being too busy to pay attention carefully or a little out of practice. I had been using it in quick breads and coffee cakes just to keep it going, but yesterday, spent time to make a real loaf. 

Process that used to work for me:
Use 1/2 C each of flour, water, starter to create a sponge, rest for 2 hours.
Add 1/2 C oil, 1/4 honey or agave, 1 tsp salt, 2 C bread flour. Knead and let rise under floured cloth 5-8 hours.
Punch down, shape, place in banneton, let rise 1-2 hours or until doubled.
Bake on hot pizza stone heated at 450 F, at temp of 400 F for 55 minutes.

No rise. All condensed. Rechecking the starter and it smells cheesy instead of boozy but no color change or mold. Now seems to have no bubbles.
Changed jars and fed twice since suspecting it had started to die, and there is almost no activity and smells like flour. 
I am super tempted to add a little yeast to give it a boost, but I don't want to mess with the integrity of the original culture.

Currently I am using a Gaggia Magento Prestige but the cleaning every week where I take the machine half apart to be able to clean the brewing group is starting to bother me. I also feel that there is still more to get out of the beans.

I am by no means a coffee expert in the sense that I taste every detail and every change in grind. I do enjoy drinking a good cup of coffee and like to 'experiment' with it. So my eye has fallen on the Ninja Luxe Essential. Are there any redditors here who have experience with this particular model and can say something about the quality?

I am also very interested in brewing a Lungo with this machine, how does that work? My current lungos are about 100ml. With the issue of the Ninja, is it a matter of setting the “size” to L?",1,1735997714.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1hteg9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hteg9e/a_house/,a House,"A few months ago, I started taking walks at night. 

I had not been getting out much since I started my new job, rented a place in a nice, calm part of town and finally got my life something resembling together, after a long period of drifting aimlessly. My whole life, really. Paying the bills on a spacious studio apartment meant sinking every moment I had into work and chores, and I was starting to feel the restlessness that always came to me after too much time spent in cubicles and walls that started closing in on me no matter how nice the wallpaper, and I needed to get out.

It was a nice change of pace, having some time to myself to process and grab a smoke while looking at a clear sky full of stars. My idea of going out used to be getting trashed and spending the next day recovering so I could do it all over again, but I was getting used to crisp air and listening to the thoughts in my head for once, even if they’re sometimes biting.

It’s a nice neighborhood, like I said, with lots of rustic houses lit up by string lights in the gardens, and a few apartment buildings like my own strewn about, so I’m never scared to wander as late as I want, listening to some new album I haven’t had the time to catch up on, or trusty old Cure if nothing else. There are never very many people out this time of year, which makes it peaceful, and the occasional dog-walker or late shift worker always shares a friendly smile, and I’m left to stroll the tiny park areas, enjoying the way nighttime always makes everything more cinematic and moody than the gray daylight of autumn. Slowly I’ve mapped out the entire area on my lazy strolls, taking this way or that, venturing into new, winding streets and always finding something picturesque to see – an unfamiliar greenhouse or a frosty duck pond. I’m not entirely familiar with the area just yet to where I don’t sometimes get a little lost, but I’ve got a pretty good sense of direction and I’m getting there. 

Sounds idyllic, I can hear you say. Why am I writing about this boring stuff?

Well, the other night I found a house I’d never seen before.

It was a regular house -- it is a regular house, perfectly ordinary and normal, if a little out of place with its stark white paint among the red-tiled and wooden-knotted styles of the rest of the neighborhood, but there's all kinds nestled in there. My favorite is a gray-stained one with a roof the size and sharpness of an old church, and a yellow, almost Victorian style one with a little turret. 

I couldn’t tell you why the white-painted house stuck out to me, or why a strange feeling made my skin crawl when I saw it. I just knew it felt unpleasant.

It’s situated at the end of a bend in the road, where the woods behind it meet a highway far away behind the thick of pine trees, and it stands just a little distant to the rest of the neighborhood. the streetlights stop reaching because there's nothing to light up over there. They're doing some construction at the end of the road that looks perpetually not in progress, just scraps of metal and hardware stacked and waiting, and it’s the one area of the neighborhood that doesn’t feel homely. Maybe that's what got to me, that sort of liminal feeling that only industrial structures at night give you.

In any case, after the first time it caught my eye, I started walking past it every time I went out. I don’t know why. Oddities have always drawn me in, and there’s a pleasant little rush in finding strange things at a safe distance, this tiny five minute moment every night that would intrigue me at the start of my walk and get the gears going in my head for some short story or other before I turned back to my quaint neighborhood.

*Theres something wrong with that house*, I’d think every time I passed it, smiling a little at my own silliness. *It's too still. Too stark, somehow. Why are the lights never on?*

Frankly, it was a good question. Even though I'd start walking in the evening, I still had to get up in the morning, so it wasn't like I was out there at three A.M. or anything, and the lights were always on in every other house I’d see. Someone would be preparing for bed, watching TV lazily in the living room, scraping the leftovers from their dinner into a container in the kitchen.

I like watching people. I like throwing quick glances at windows, catching glimpses of their day to day. I live a mostly solitary life, and there’s something fascinating to me about people, their habits and their things, their choice of bookshelves and lamps and pictures lining their walls, the life they’ve accumulated over the years and inhabit daily without thinking about it. It says so much about them, these boxes they live in, their places of safety. I’ve always felt like a solitary observer of everyone around me, taking quiet notes of little details like that, an explorer in a strange world of domesticity I’ve never had myself.

Put it like that, maybe I’m just lonely.

In any case, this house had none of that. Nothing for me to see, to analyze and turn to stories in my head. If there was furniture, I couldn’t see it because these people went to bed at eight every night, and there was nothing on the front lawn, not even a car or a watering hose, just well-kept green grass that felt bare-boned  somehow. Like someone doing the very least of the concept of living. Like someone playing house with no imagination.

Listen, I’m an overthinker, so take all of this with a grain of salt.

I guess that's why I kept obsessing over it, why I kept wandering by first at the start of my route and then sometimes to finish, trying to get anything out of that place at all. Any semblance of personality, of that essence that any other home would give me. Who were the people that lived there? You'd think no one did, but someone kept that lawn well maintained, someone would periodically open and close the blinds on the second floor. I walked by it once in daylight before work, and the blinds in one small window were closed where they had been open the night before, so someone had to have done that. Still no lights on, and the windows were just dark and empty as usual, contrasted by the pristine white paint, as if daylight just couldn't penetrate that place. A child's drawing of a house before they'd gotten bored and wandered off, not bothering to fill in those classical awkward squares for curtains and crude flowerpots.

Just emptiness. 

Interesting to me, because emptiness like that isn’t easily achieved. We leave some kind of traces of ourselves everywhere, whether we like to or not, simply by living. Even the trees outside were anonymous. No fruit, or markings on the bark. No treehouses, no decorations. Just trees, in the most basic sense of the word. It made me think of a poem I liked: *when all you need to know of a place is, do people live there. If they do, you know everything*. I felt like I knew nothing. Not about the house, nor its inhabitants. Nothing about life in general to be honest.

Who keeps a whole house just to visit on occasion? What house would stay uninhabited for long, especially such a spacious one in such a charming neighborhood? Someone had to live there, but they seemed to never be there, and I'm sure that once this thought hit you, you'd also be intrigued. Maybe not as much as me, but you haven't been there.

You haven't felt the nothingness.

I like horror. I love horror actually, it's my favorite genre when it comes to films, books, games, you name it. Creepy podcasts about monsters from folklore, unsettling historical facts about torture and plagues, even just unsolved stories like the Dyatlov pass is my jam, and I’ve read every creepypasta under the sun. It's been a rough time in my life lately, before I finally got this job, and my last relationship was a trainwreck I still haven't recovered from and maybe never will. I haven't been sleeping well... Ever, really. I romanticise things to cope with my fucked up childhood, and I’ve always made up little stories in my head to make the world around me seem less daunting, or more exciting, or just to be anywhere else than where I am. I've been on antidepressants since July. The same kind my mother used to take.

The same kind of ghosts that plague my mind also haunted hers.

I'm telling you all of this to be fully honest, so you know that I have a vivid imagination, that I try to escape the pressing bleakness of reality as much as I can, that I'm not doing well and never really have. So you know, that I'm an unreliable narrator. It feels important, it feels clean, that you know as well as me that it all could have been a trick of my mind, that it all could have a perfectly reasonable, normal explanation. Though I still can't explain what happened that night.

I still don’t really understand.

I was walking a little later than usual, nearer to midnight, because it was a Friday and I didn't have work the next day, but I'd had a mess of a workday earlier. The kind that never seems to end, where things just keep stacking up and everything around you that usually runs smoothly keeps failing, until you think you'll never get out. I finally escaped sometime after eight, and got home to make dinner in a pissed off mood, and burnt that too. It was just one of those days.

My walks were sanctuary though, and I still dragged my ass out into the crisp air after lying around feeling sorry for myself on the couch for a bit, finding nothing good to watch on the TV and hitting every wrong note on my beat up guitar. 

To amuse myself, as usual, I decided to take a tour of the House. Since my discovery of it, it has permanently become the House, capital letters, in my mind. An entity. My own private little Scooby Gang Mystery. The world's most boring horror story, where the only horror was the absence of things instead of anything horrific that was actually there.

Well, until that night, anyway.

That night, I saw something. Something, finally, in the little window where the blinds would move where nothing else did. An outline, a shape, almost imperceptible in the dark, but unmistakably there.

Remember, this is not a spooky neighborhood, and there are still streetlights somewhere in the distance and a neighbouring house, even if it's farther away than usual. There was just enough light from the outside, to make out that shape in the window, and I didn't immediately find it unsettling. It's a damned weird house in my mind, but I can still understand the difference between what's real and what isn't. At least I think I can. I'm not so sure anymore.

""Oh, someone does live there,"" was my immediate thought. ""there goes the theory that it’s uninhabited or for sale.""

My second thought, after getting a little closer, was, ""are they looking at me?""

I couldn't tell, because the shape in the window was all black, something just a little darker than its surrounding. The blinds were pulled all the way up, fully exposing the glass of it, and behind it I could just see someone vaguely human-shaped. Long hair, when I got closer. I think they were looking at me, because I've never felt so watched in my whole life. So seen, so exposed. I can't explain it, because how could I, but it was that prickly feeling up the back of your neck, hair-raising thing that you sometimes get, and then you turn around and someone who was watching you at the bus stop or coming up behind you on a running trail appears, and you think nothing of it. It happens. Just an old reflex from more animalistic times.

It was that, but turned up a million times stronger. Unbearable, almost. More like what a deer caught in headlights must feel just before the car hits and breaks their bones.

I got closer. The shape didn't move. I walked all the way up beside the House where the road bends, and the shape did not move. Did not fix anything in the window, because there was nothing to fix. Didn’t fiddle with the blinds, didn't turn away when they saw me approach and stare. Just stood there, perfectly still, as still as the rest of that House, as still as everything in that weird bubble universe of a garden. Thinking about it then, I realized I'd never seen the trees sway in any breeze.

It stood there as if its only purpose was to stand there. It stood there, as if it was waiting for something. 

It stood there, as if it was waiting for me.

I walked by.

What the hell else was I supposed to do? Stay there, staring back like a freak? People are allowed to stand in their windows, they're allowed to do whatever they want in their homes. I was the weirdo out there, making up nonsense because my mind won't ever shut up, and no matter what, what I felt was irrelevant.

I walked by, because I was scared.

I couldn't get home fast enough, all the time feeling like that watched feeling never left me, that thing boring its gaze into the back of neck. I don't know why I thought of it as a thing. It was a person, clearly, but it was a person as much as that House was a house. rudimentarily. Barely. Emptily.

I got home and I drank three beers, not giving a shit about the warnings on my meds, and fell asleep watching something stupid on TV, some boring talk show about local politics droning me into sleep with its mundanity.

You'd think I had nightmares. That my spooky brain would take this fucked up event and turn it into a feast of horrors, but I didn’t dream anything. I woke up, and the space between the previous night and late morning was entirely empty to me. Not the kind of blackout you get from being drunk, not that. I’ve had my fair share of those over the years and this wasn't blissful darkness. I still had the inexplicable feeling that I had dreamt, that I had been somewhere, the way you go to places in your mind when you dream and understand that time has passed, but that the place was a nothing where something should have been. Just emptiness. Just the House, I suppose.

It was still enough to amuse me. I don't scare easily. You don't get through the kind of shit I've been through by being easily scared. People do, memories sometimes, that cloying feeling of pathological unwellness that rots you from the inside. The hard truths in life do, like the fact that sometimes the people who love you the most will cut you the deepest because they just can’t help themselves. Not people in windows. Not scary stories. Not made up things. Not the things that should scare me, that are designed to. Real intimacy, now that's fucking terrifying if you ask me. This? This was funny. It was exciting. It was something that wasn't boring and mundane when everything else seemed to be, and honestly I couldn't wait to go back.

Now I know why people in horror movies act like idiots. Because they are, because theyre fucked up, because we all have something in our heads that wont let us rest. Because we never quite outgrow that urge to touch a hot stove just to see what happens, just to feel our skin sizzle a little. Some of us don't even have anyone to teach us not to. Some of us have our hands pressed against the burner and held there, and we learn to like it.

So, back I went. I pretended to have a whole Saturday full of things that normal people do,  washing clothes and dishes and catching up on some vacuuming, taking a long bath and reading a magazine, messing around on the computer for a bit. All the while pretending like I wasn't waiting, like I wasn't in standby mode until night time, when I would go back to that House and maybe catch a glimpse of my watcher again. More realistically see nothing and realize that I didn't even see anything the night before. To be honest, I'd also had a beer with dinner. Maybe two, I don't recall. Actually, I’d like not to recall, but I know.

As soon as time came around, around the same time as the night before, I was out the door and lighting up a smoke, saying hello to the rare neighbor on their way to town to have a pub-night with friends or the like. It really is a sleepy little place, and I'm glad, because too much noise and hustle drives me crazy. I hated living in the city. Here I feel like a ghost, a dark, ill-fitting shape of something that's awkwardly settled into an easier life, a vampire in retirement. Out of place, but content.

The House was of course where it always was, waiting for me. Blank, pale face with black, unseeing eyes. nothing in the window. I remember actually sighing, in relief of disappointment, I'm not sure which. And so I stood there, in the dark, by the still trees and my still, empty House and felt a little dejected. A little stupid. I lit a cigarette, and smoked for a bit, still enjoying the vast night, the moon and the stars. I cheered myself up by thinking that it was the weekend after all, and I could play some guitar when I came home, maybe call my friend I haven't heard from in ages and see if she was doing better. I stood there for a while, finishing my cigarette and lighting another, fiddling with my phone. Maybe I was waiting, truth be told.

I was selecting an album to play and stubbing the cigarette out on the ground, and in that movement I saw it, out of the corner of my eye. The shape.

It was standing there again, so still and so dark, and the prickly feeling at the back of my neck came back. I was pretty close to the House, closer than I'd ever gotten before, almost to the gate, and I suppose I wouldn't have heard the blinds open, it's a small noise, but... I think I might have. I should have. I have really good hearing, hypervigilance my doctor calls it, attuned to a pin drop on the floor above me sometimes. 

To the smallest cough, to what feels like peoples thoughts sometimes. It's the world's most annoying superpower, and I always have to plug my ears to get any sleep if I don’t manage to focus on something lulling from the TV. I could hear the faint sounds of music from the house way up the street, and the highway was a muffled buzz masked by the woods, and I could hear all these things as clearly as I always can, but I didn't hear the blinds open, even though I was just a few feet from the source. It's... Whatever, that's normal, I don't know why I'm focusing on that right now.

I'd periodically been looking up at the House, at the window, and a minute ago the blinds that had been closed were open, and the shape was there. It was looking at me.

I knew it was looking at me.

I stood there, frozen for a while, staring up at the thing staring at me, wondering if I was losing my mind with the detached amusement that thought always brings me, and then I shook my head to snap myself out of it.

And the thing shook its head too.

It shook its head like I had shaken mine, black hair swaying a little, and I felt oddly sick. I don't know why. That deer in the headlights feeling was more of a mouse in the lights of semi truck-strong, and I felt... calm. I know that doesnt make sense with everything else I'm telling you here, but it’s what I felt. Something had gone still inside of me. Completely still, and... empty. It crept into me, like a foreign force, like something outside of me, winding its tendrils from the dark and into my body. It wasn't mine. It came from the House.

I walked up a step. I walked another step. Until I was pressed against the gate, against the unusually tall rails that looked almost like prison bars in the shadows, until my hands were pressed against them and I tried my hardest to squint. To see. It was useless. 

There was no light. There was no light at all, and there was none coming from the streetlights that were too far away, or the house up the road that was closest, and it didn't reach here and that wasn't why I could see the shape. I dont know why I thought that was why I could see it the night before, I dont know why I thought that when the light was coming from behind it, only the light wasn’t light, it was more an absence of dark, just slightly lesser than the dark of the rest of that fucking damned place, and I could see the shape because

because it wanted me to see it.

I tilted my head, trying to make sense of it.

It tilted its head. 

At the same time.

No latency.

I ran.

There's no way around it, I hightailed out if there was something chasing me. I'm not a complete moron, there's still some survival skills left in me, rusty as they may be. I ran all the way home, up the stairs and slammed the door behind me, gasping for air against it. My lungs spasmed, and I had a stitch in my side. *I should really stop smoking*, I thought.

I did all the things I said I would do the night before. I cooked, I cleaned, and I called my friend. She seemed far away in that way she always is, but she was glad to hear from me. She let me rattle on about my job and how awful I found it really, in my heart of hearts, and the new apartment that makes it all worth it, makes me feel like a new person. Someone decent and respectable and all those things I told myself once that I didn't need, but secretly craved somewhere inside all along.

It was good to speak to her, good to laugh a little about stupid things. She did seem better, I could hear it in her voice and the way she spoke about the new succulents she had just bought, about how she looked forward to the coming spring and how it would bring with it some much needed sunshine. I hope she stays that way. I hope she stays clean this time.

I stayed away from any mention of the House, pushing it down to the deepest recesses of my mind, where it laid festering like an infected wound all the same. I remained in some strange way frozen all day, having a hard time making any simple decisions, from how to fold the laundry to what to drink in the evening. Coffee or tea? Coffee would keep me up, give me energy for the night. It wouldn’t let me sleep, though, and I knew I needed rest more than anything.

I chose coffee, and already then I must have known. The whole day had been a state of denial. Each task I set up for myself was another way to bargain, to plead for one more moment of normalcy before the inevitable came.

This happened a few hours ago and I am honestly at loss here. I'm currently recovering from a shoulder injury and my sister has been taking care of me. I'm doing much better but I still struggle with things like carrying shopping bags or picking up stuff. Every day I take coffee to go and go for a walk as it helps to alleviate the pain. Today I went to get coffee with my sister and on our walk back home a couple of kids threw a firecracker under my feet. Thankfully it didn't work, otherwise I definitely would have lost my balance (I still struggle with that too sometimes) and I would've fallen on my injured back and who knows what would've happened next. It's black ice all over where we live, so I was relieved I was safe. The kids ran away and I joked to my sister ""Should we chase them?'"" To my surprise she was absolutely oblivious to everything that happened and didn't believe me! And she was literally standing an inch away! I had to point out the firecracker in the snow for her to admit that yes, there was a firecracker and yes, I could've been injured me more. I asked why she didn't believe me immediately when I told her what happened and she just went ""I had to see it for myself"". Even if she didn't see what happened (although I don't know how it was possible with her walking right next to me), I don't understand why wouldn't she believe me. I was hurt by it. It looked like for whatever reason she tried to gaslit me. So I said as much. She apologized a few times, every time saying ""I had to see it for myself"". And this is where I might be the asshole: I said that I'm hurt I had to show her the physical evidence for her to believe me, I can't understand why my word wasn't enough, I could've been injured because of a stupid prank and she's apologizing for the wrong thing.

I was like hang on, Diego Bermudez? Castillo Thermal Shock? Cardamon? Isnt this Milky Cake? They were impressed i knew what it was.

The guys at Driink in Chelmsford Essex have a very small roaster, but access to some interesting green beans. 

My first try got a good hit of Cardamon and Lime, and its similar but not the same as Milky Cake due to the lime element. Its almost like a chocolate lime sweet rather than lime juice too. Very interesting.

The other night, first date , met on Coffee Meets Bagel, she's very fit, works out daily, pics actually were current (shocker!!). She picked a very nice upscale Asian resto, excellent food, good conversation, got along well enough to plan a second date.

I pay the bill, not cheap - $240 w/tip & not a lot of drinks, but I knew that going in.

Here's the part that I feel signals a Taker: there was a LOT of food left over and not because it was bad, just that it all looked so good, we over ordered. She asked that it be boxed and when we get up to leave, she doesn't ask me if I might like some. There were at least 2, maybe 3 boxes in the large bag she wordlessly grabbed after putting on her coat. I drive her home and that's it.

It didn't really bother me in the moment. But later on, driving home, I did reflect on it and decided this is a tell: she's a Taker, perhaps more because of the automatic way she just did it. No checking with me if I might like some, just grab and go, and she's good.

It started around April after I quit my job on leap day Feb 2024. (March was my birthday month so it doesn't count 😝)

I had gastroparesis like symptoms: heartburn, pain in the upper stomach, bloating, farting, feeling like stomach grew smaller etc

I reduced my meal size and increased my meal frequency.

Then I was diagnosed with ADHD and I was put on Atomoxetine (SNRI) 10mg, then titrated to 18mg, but later down to 9mg due to psychosis like symptoms.

I ate normally while on those meds. Then when I stopped them, I started having violent episodes of diarrhoea and I couldn't understand why. I did some experiments and realized it's happening after consuming milk and spicy foods to a lesser extent. 

I went to a GI and he said it's probably food poisoning and put me on 5 days course of Rifaximin 400 (antibiotic) and VSL 3 (for refilling the lost bacteria). 

But even after 2 rounds of the same set of medications, nothing changed. 

I switched to a new more expensive GI.

I told him my symptoms and he recommended a stool routine, occult blood, and a H pylori antigen test (the last one was on my request as I was doubting that)

I also had food intolerance test when switching from GI no 1 to GI no 2. (None of the GI's was named Joe).

All tests came back negative. 

Meanwhile, in real life, the pattern of diarrhoea post milk hasn't changed. So my chai and cappuccino have been replaced with black tea and coffee (and I hate it!).

A pattern with brown bread/multigrain brown bread has also surfaced. 

So my GI no 2 said it's most likely gluten induced intolerance. But then why is it happening with milk? It never happened with  curd (yoghurt) or buttermilk but it has started happening with that also. 

What about Jowar (sorghum)? Yes, diarrhoea triggered with that also.

1hteaak,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1hteaak/how_to_actually_stop_procrastinating_my_story/,How to actually stop procrastinating (my story),"Hey everyone,

I’d like to share with you a story and my own findings on how to actually stop procrastinating.

It’s been a very rocky road to get to where I am now - actually getting work done, not feeling super overwhelmed by the smallest task imaginable and being emotionally healthy (to some extent)

Soo, lets get started. I’ve been a serious procrastinator all through high school, college and even after I finished all that and got my first job. I was a perfectionist and doing any work felt like moving a mountain. I would often wait till the last moment to start studying for exams and then I would rush only to realize I should have started earlier.

In my career after college, trying to start my own business procrastination just really postponed “success” and what I could have been by now. When you are “your own boss” and you set your own tasks with no one to hold you accountable, getting work done was super hard for me. I would stagnate, watch movies in bed, watch stupid TikToks, go for long walks, go get coffee with my friends, watch motivational videos, … you name it, I did it. Instead of sitting down and just starting to do even the tiniest bit of work, I procrastinated like a m\*\*\*\*\*\*rf\*\*\*\*\*r.\*

I only realized I seriously needed to solve that problem when my bank account was getting empty and I had almost no income.

That is when I started to read everything about procrastination, why it happens, how to stop and listening to my body and mind. Only after that I discovered why I do that and how I can solve it.

Soo, without further ado, let me tell you how I actually stopped procrastinating and how you can do it too.

Procrastination doesn’t mean you’re being lazy or you’re bad at managing time. At its core, it’s an emotional issue. We avoid tasks because they feel uncomfortable. Maybe they seem too hard, too boring, or too overwhelming. Instead of dealing with that discomfort, we distract ourselves with things that feel good in the moment, like scrolling through social media or binge-watching movies (for me it was LOTR). There is a really simple thing you need to understand here: procrastination is problem of emotional resistance, and not how much effort you put in.

To stop procrastinating, you don’t need a better to-do list or the latest productivity hack. You need to reframe how you approach the tasks you’ve been avoiding. You can start by recognizing that every “big” task is just a series of small, manageable steps. The problem arises when you look at the entire thing as one huge f\*\*\*\*g mountain. For example, if you need to study for an exam, your brain immediately jumps to hours of effort, stress, and hard work. But in reality, the first step might be as simple as opening your book or sitting down at your desk. That’s it. Once you take that first step, the rest will often fall into place naturally.

The reason tasks feel overwhelming is because we attach too much emotional weight to them. We convince ourselves they’re harder than they really are. This isn’t logical and it usually means our emotions are taking control. To break free of this, you need to disrupt that pattern of thinking. Remind yourself that the task itself is likely far simpler than you believe it is. Studying for a test isn’t really that hard, it’s just reading, reviewing notes, or solving a few problems. Cleaning your room isn’t a massive obstacle, it’s picking up one piece of clothing at a time. By reframing tasks in this way, you take the emotional resistance out of the equation.

Next.

Action is the ultimate cure to procrastination. The hardest part is starting because our emotions are loudest before we begin. But once you take even the smallest action, things become much easier. If you’re stuck watching videos instead of working, don’t tell yourself, “I need to study for five hours.” Instead, just pause the video. That one small action sets everything in motion. Once the video is paused, it’s easier to close the tab. Once the tab is closed, it’s easier to open your book. Before you know it, you’re already working, and the resistance is no longer there.

Procrastination basically fuels on your avoidance and grows stronger the longer you let it direct your life. The key is to stop giving your emotions the power to decide what you do. You control your feelings, not the other way around. Recognize and accept what you are feeling and take control. It’s normal to dread studying and yes, it can feel overwhelming, but it doesn’t reflect reality. The task isn’t as big or difficult as you think it is. By changing your perspective and focusing on the smallest possible step forward, you can break the cycle of avoiding what you need to do and actually get it done.

Remember, the process is really simple: start small, focus on the next achievable action, and let momentum do the rest. Don’t overthink it. Just start. Once you’re moving, everything else becomes easier. The power to beat procrastination isn’t in pushing yourself harder and hating yourself because you’re procrastinating; it’s in understanding the root of the problem and taking control of your emotions.

Thank you!

I can see it can be scary or uncomfortable to meet someone new during a walk. So I see the good thing about getting together in a bar. Or something like that.

1hte4mp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTS/comments/1hte4mp/the_unhinged_and_diabolical_chronicles_of_uts_a/,The Unhinged and Diabolical Chronicles of UTS: A Brain Rot Saga,"Welcome to the University of Technology Sydney, or as the locals call it, the incubator of chaos, where dreams go to die, or if you’re lucky, get transformed into a half-baked startup idea that involves a ridiculous amount of avocado toast and a vague promise of “disrupting the market.” Strap in, because you’re about to enter the unholy pit of caffeine overdoses, existential crises, and the kind of unfiltered ambition that’s more dangerous than a MacBook without a charger.

The legend begins with Dylan, an eager first-year student studying “Creative Industries” (because nothing screams “I’m going places” like having no actual career path but an inexplicable desire to ""create"" something). Dylan, sporting a sweater that probably cost more than his textbooks, was brimming with hope as he entered the shimmering glass fortress that was UTS—a university designed by someone who hated sleep and loved bad angles. It was, as everyone would soon learn, a place where your soul gets quietly sucked out by an endless barrage of presentations, overpriced salads, and people who unironically wear cargo pants to lectures.

Dylan’s first lecture was in Building 6, the one that looked like it was designed by a toddler with a caffeine addiction and a ruler. Upon entering, he noticed something unusual—half the students were hunched over their laptops, typing out emails that were probably more important than the actual lecture. The other half were engaged in an intense, life-altering debate over which brand of kombucha was the most “sustainable.” Dylan immediately felt he had made a terrible mistake.

The lecturer, Dr. Fiona (who had somehow managed to combine both an MBA and a PhD in Being Extra), walked in wearing a blazer that was clearly designed to scream “I’m an entrepreneurial spirit who definitely knows how to code.” She proceeded to tell the class that the future of the industry wasn’t about hard skills—it was about “creative collaboration” and “authentic personal branding.” Dylan, whose understanding of branding was limited to posting memes on his Instagram story, felt both enlightened and terrified.

“Now,” Dr. Fiona continued, “Let’s talk about disrupting the status quo. Anyone here have an idea for a startup? Don’t be shy. This is your moment to pitch your vision.”

At this, Dylan’s mind went blank. He glanced nervously around the room, noticing that everyone else had somehow come prepared with ideas that were both vague and pretentious at the same time. One student pitched a wearable device that would “measure your soul energy” and suggest personalized meditation apps, while another presented a ""new wave"" coffee brand called Bean Revolution, promising ethically sourced beans from “remote villages” that definitely weren’t just wholesale from Alibaba.

Dylan, in a panic, blurted out, “What if we create a platform where people can share their ‘journeys’ with their plants?”

The room went quiet for a solid five seconds. Dr. Fiona’s eyes gleamed like she’d just found the next Uber for self-growth. “I love it, Dylan! We’re going to take over the world with plant-based content!”

From that moment, Dylan’s path was sealed. He was now, according to UTS, a visionary. His new startup, called LeafLifters, was to become the next big thing. The idea was simple: an app that allowed people to post about the ""emotional growth"" of their indoor plants and interact with others on their botanical journeys.

And so, Dylan plunged headfirst into the abyss of start-up culture, where every lecture became an excuse to discuss his latest “pivot” or “user acquisition strategy.” He soon found himself surrounded by a group of equally lost and confused souls, each more entrepreneurial than the last. They’d gather in the UTS library (which was more of a glorified Starbucks with a few books) to “collaborate” on their business plans. These meetings, which were 95% accidentally bumping into each other while looking for a power socket, always included deep discussions about “disrupting” things that didn’t need to be disrupted in the first place.

Kate, a fellow “creative industries” student, proudly announced that she was going to “revolutionize the fashion industry with biodegradable glitter.” This, of course, was followed by an intense debate about which sustainable, non-GMO glitter had the best “sustainability credentials.” Meanwhile, Jared had taken up the noble quest of “re-imagining” the humble lunchbox. His company, “LunchTrek,” promised to make lunchboxes so innovative that they could literally change the way you thought about food, or something.

The university’s culture was a cauldron of this unhinged energy, with students locked in an eternal struggle to outdo each other in their “visionary nonsense.” Dylan’s life became an endless loop of networking, pitching, and trying to figure out how to get more than 12 downloads of his plant app. Eventually, he realized he’d spent more time explaining his “vision” than actually doing any work for his actual degree.

Then there was The Great UTS Cafeteria Incident.

One fateful afternoon, Dylan and his startup crew ventured into the UTS cafeteria, where the food was as questionable as the student body’s ability to differentiate between “business ideas” and “delusions of grandeur.” They sat down with their quinoa bowls (which, they swore, were “locally sourced from inner-city markets”) and began to discuss their disruptive futures.

But as they brainstormed the next big thing—an app to track your “vibes” based on the music you listened to—it quickly became apparent that the coffee machine had broken down. Panic ensued. This was, in fact, an existential crisis. Without their precious flat whites, the students of UTS were forced to reckon with their own inner emptiness.

In that moment, Dylan had an epiphany: ""What if... the app IS the coffee? It’s a mood booster, but in digital form!""

And so, BrewBeats was born, a subscription service that combined playlists with coffee deliveries. No one knew how it worked, and honestly, neither did Dylan. But that didn’t matter, because within a week, they’d secured $100,000 in seed funding from a mysterious VC firm that had probably been run by a guy who once bought stock in GoPro.

As for Dylan’s degree? Well, let’s just say that it was the least important thing about his life now. He graduated not with a deep understanding of his subject but with an impressive portfolio of PowerPoint presentations, each more absurd than the last. By the time he got his diploma, UTS had renamed one of their buildings after him (kind of) for his visionary work in “transforming the plant-planting app industry.”

The End. Or, more accurately, the beginning of more app ideas that no one really needed. But hey, that's UTS. Welcome to the future, where the brain rot is not only real—it's funded.",4,1735996450.0,UTS,0,0.83,False
1hte40a,https://www.reddit.com/r/UWS/comments/1hte40a/the_incredibly_diabolical_tale_of_western_sydney/,"The Incredibly Diabolical Tale of Western Sydney Uni: A Brain Rot Odyssey
","Once upon a time, in the soul-crushing heart of Western Sydney University (WSU), a place more chaotic than a Taco Bell at 3 AM, there existed a cadre of students whose very existence was held together by the brittle thread of energy drinks, questionable decisions, and TikTok trends. These brave souls, the WSU brain rotters, had no time for normality or sanity, only the pure, unfiltered chaos of university life.

It all began in the hallowed halls of Building Z, the architectural equivalent of a poorly-designed potato. The air inside was thick with the scent of overpriced coffee, student loan anxiety, and the faint, mysterious aroma of stale memes. Legend has it, if you hung out near the Communication Building, you'd hear whispers of a cursed lecture theatre—L2.31—that could make anyone lose their sense of time, space, and dignity within 15 minutes.

Our protagonist, Bradley, a self-described ""future influencer"" majoring in ""Marketing Memes,"" was embarking on his first year at WSU. He thought he knew what he was getting into. But Bradley had never met Professor Jenkins, a man so out of touch with reality that he still used a flip phone and referred to the internet as ""the Googles."" Professor Jenkins was known for his lectures on ""Marketing Strategies in the Post-Pandemic Age,"" which mostly involved him showing YouTube videos from 2008 and asking if anyone remembered the Harlem Shake. The class would leave each session with a 30% decrease in IQ, a mental fog so thick you could cut it with a knife (or more realistically, a $5 pasta from the cafeteria).

Bradley, at the time still fresh with hope and delusion, arrived early on his first day to make a good impression. As he walked into the lecture hall, the atmosphere was immediately oppressive. The fluorescent lights flickered like they were auditioning for a role in a low-budget horror film. There, sitting in the front row, was Bridget, the self-proclaimed ""Queen of Energy Drinks,"" clutching a half-empty Monster like it was the Holy Grail. Her eyes were bloodshot, her hands were trembling, and she was already deep into a debate with Kyle, who was enthusiastically explaining how he planned to become a ""full-time gamer and professional influencer"" with a degree in Communications.

""Yo, dude, I swear the only reason I’m here is because I need a Wi-Fi password and a degree for my Instagram bio,"" Kyle announced, his fingers furiously swiping through TikTok for the next viral dance challenge. ""If I get this marketing thing down, I’ll be making bank on sponsored posts in no time.""

Professor Jenkins, meanwhile, was 10 minutes late, having forgotten to get his morning coffee, which was a tragic mistake, because without it, he was about as useful as a potato in a swimming pool. He stumbled into the room, mumbling something about the ""dangers of influencer culture"" and how he once met a guy who made a million dollars selling fidget spinners.

""You know,"" Jenkins slurred, ""the thing about influencers is that they’re like... the modern-day philosophers. Just look at Jake Paul—his insights on life are as profound as any Socratic dialogue.""

The class, heavily under the influence of pre-lecture panic and low blood sugar, nodded enthusiastically. Some students even started typing out ""Jake Paul"" quotes into their notes, mistaking it for academic brilliance.

And so began Bradley’s descent into madness.

By week three, the brain rot had begun to set in. Bradley had long since abandoned any hope of understanding marketing principles or anything remotely related to his degree. His entire existence was consumed by the endless cycle of mid-tier memes, group projects where no one did anything except argue about the best TikTok filter, and the occasional foray into WSU's tragic cafeteria. There, he encountered Greg, the ""grill master"" of the canteen, who was rumored to have once cooked a burger so well-done that it created a new existential crisis for all who ate it.

One fateful afternoon, Bradley, Kyle, and Bridget sat down for a deep philosophical discussion over their daily $5 meal deal (which came with a free existential crisis). Kyle had just finished explaining the finer points of his Minecraft server empire, while Bridget was busy plotting her next TikTok stunt involving a shopping trolley and 18 cans of Red Bull.

Bradley sighed. “I came here to get a degree, but all I’ve got is a mental breakdown and a TikTok following.""

Bridget, her hands shaking from the latest Red Bull infusion, nodded. “Same. I don’t know how I’m gonna put ‘Crisis of the Self’ as a subject on my resume, but I’m definitely gonna do it.”

And thus, the students of WSU continued their tragicomic existence. Their minds rotted away, not from the academic pressures, but from the relentless onslaught of memes, energy drinks, and the dawning realization that their futures were as uncertain as whether Fortnite would ever die.

As for Bradley, he eventually became a TikTok sensation, known for his videos titled “How to Pass a Marketing Degree Without Actually Knowing Anything.” In one viral clip, he confidently declared, “Just slap a hashtag on it, fam, and hope for the best. #UniversityLife #BrainRotForLife.”

And in the end, they all graduated, with varying levels of success, depending on how many TikTok followers they had at the time. Some became influencers, some became baristas, and others… well, others just drifted aimlessly into the abyss of student loan debt, never to be heard from again.

there are almost 30 tables and we were only three waiters yesterday at rush hour. I was inside alone with 10 tables, and I hated every second of it. I made quite some mistakes and I don't know if it's because of anxiety or my OCD, or both, but I can't stop thinking about every single thing I did.

I have chronic guilt and I feel extremely guilty because I feel like I slowed everyone down, the other waiters and mainly the poor barista that had to deal with my mistakes. I apologized to her and she told me it was super okay, that everyone makes mistakes but I still feel bad (also apologized to the waiters). thankfully, although some clients were a little irritated by the wait, when I apologized they were very cool about it too, but I wanted to freaking cry.

if there's any advice on how to cope with this I'd be super thankful. I want to stop worrying so much about mistakes I've made since I can't go back in time to fix them, but my brain doesn't understand that, and also feeling so guilty about everything. also, although I guess I'd have more luck on another subreddit, if you have tips for rush hour I'd be very grateful as well. thanks!!",1,1735996107.0,Anxiety,3,1.0,False

I suggest have the eggs with homemade mayo and mint chutney.

# Mint Chutney

Keto homemade mint chutney

Ingredients:

* 250 gm Mint leaves, washed and chopped
* 100 gm coriander or cilantro leaves, washed and chopped
* Juice of 2 to 3 lemons
* 1 medium red onion, sliced
* 4 to 5 green chilies roughly chopped
* Pink and White, salt to taste
* Red chilly powder to taste
* Few drops of stevia optional

Blend all of the ingredients until they form a fine paste. To this Tuesday Keto Diet Plan meal, some Indian housewives also add a teaspoon of sugar. This chutney keeps for at least a week on the shelf, so always keep it in an airtight container.

# Homemade Mayo

This is my mother-in-law’s recipe, and it’s a favorite of everybody at home.

Ingredients:

* 2 eggs
* Juice of 1 lime
* Half a liter of olive oil (I use Figaro)
* ½ tbsp salt
* 4 drops of artificial sweetener
* ½ teaspoon white vinegar
* ½ tsp white pepper
* ½ tsp black pepper
* ½ tsp mustard powder

Process

1. In a blender, crack the eggs, add the salt, sugar, mustard powder, and black and white pepper.
2. Blend till it becomes a homogeneous liquid, in about 2 minutes.
3. Now open the smaller lid or the opening to pour in the blender.
4. Switch on the blender and slowly start adding the olive oil at a constant speed.
5. Keep running the blender till the paste becomes very thick and the sound of the blender changes.
6. Now switch off the blender and add lime juice and vinegar. Blend some more till the paste moves like a homogeneous paste in the blender.
7. Now fill up some bottles and store them in your refrigerator. You can add this mayo to boiled eggs, boiled chicken, steamed fish, and boiled veggies.

I know, I know, that we can go to a grocery store and pick up a bottle of mayo from there. But the joy you get from cooking for yourself is priceless. And you should take my word for it, as I, for one, am not very fond of spending hours in the kitchen.

Process

1. Make a thick paste of all these dry masalas, with water or oil.
2. Fork the cottage cheese from all sides.
3. Now apply this paste on all sides and let the cottage cheese rest for 15 to 20 minutes.
4. Heat a griddle, add some ghee and fry this piece of cheese by turning it on all sides.
5. When it gets a lovely golden color on all sides, then switch off the stove.
6. If you have the time, before you apply the paste to the cottage cheese, slit it in the middle and apply the mint chutney.

After you are done frying, let it cool down, and now cut it into small cubes. On other days, before adding them to the dish, I also sauté some capsicum or julienned green peppers in the same pan. You can also add a few drops of fresh lime juice at the end, along with the chat masala.

I must add that I am overwhelmed by the response that I got for the Tuesday Keto Diet Plan for Day 1. And like always, I appreciate any constructive feedback that comes my way and will try to learn from it.

A lot ‘Ketoites’ thought that my diet did not adhere to the stringent guidelines of the Keto book. Well, I never claimed that it was. I am a 40-year-old woman in a small Himalayan town who has been bingeing for the past 20 years and is now attempting to get in shape. I try to stay within my macros at all times, I promise.

The important thing to note here is that after having 2 C-sections and living with almost 100 kg of weight, I am today 77 kg and on my way to getting fit.

Yes, for those of you who have been following my tale, I am down another kg since the last time I talked about it (78 kg!). So I think it’s okay if I occasionally break the rules. The critical thing is to stick to the diet and achieve my target weight no matter what.Breakfast

My boyfriend James (25m) and I (23f) are in a large friend group (<10) that has several couples in the group. Ofc as normal, some members of the group are closer to us than others, and one couple (Eliz 23f and Tony 24m) are very good friends of ours and we always end up talking to them at large group hangs. We've a lot in common with them and we share a hobby which we often do together with others from the big group. Because we share a lot of interests we occasionally go on double dates, and both myself and Eliz (and our bfs) hang out 1-2-1 on the reg (eg get coffee/lunch).  

Eliz lives in a house share with 4 others from the large group and one of them, Jack 25m, has started to complain about being ""left out of group hangs"" that are in reality just the Eliz, Tony, James and I going on double dates (we go on no more than 4 a year). 

Recently, Jack has confronted Eliz on several occasions demanding to have himself and his gf included in the ""group hangs"" we are having. They don't do the hobby we share with a larger number of the group and now class that hobby as a ""secret group hang"" they are excluded from too, mostly bc we have a separate gc from the main one as we where asked to by the main group as its a really niche hobby. We never use that gc to organise bar trips or social hangs outside the hobby. 

When Eliz returned home after our last double date Jack accused me of being the reason he and his gf are ""left out"". He specifically claims I purposefully exclude his gf, I have receipts that show I always ask her to stuff I do with Eliz and I and she is busy/says no/doesn't respond. I am normally the one that initiates the double dates bc James has bad organising skills.  Jack made Eliz cry this time and she feels like she's being targeted.

1htdrf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapabilityAdvocate/comments/1htdrf5/using_aba_in_realworld_situations_managing_an/,Using ABA in Real-World Situations: Managing an Angry Starbucks Customer,"Imagine .... it’s a frantic morning at Starbucks. The espresso machines are whirring, baristas are moving faster than a caffeine-jolted squirrel, and mobile orders are stacking up like Tetris blocks. Suddenly, a customer storms the counter like a caffeine-deprived gladiator, waving his coffee cup like it’s a flag of war. “This is NOT my drink! I ordered a triple-shot, extra-foam, oat-milk caramel macchiato!”

A barista’s nightmare? Sure. But it’s also a masterclass opportunity to apply principles of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). After all, if ABA can teach toddlers to manage tantrums, surely it can help with adults losing it over oat milk.

# The Magic of Differential Reinforcement

Differential reinforcement is an ABA strategy to encourage good behavior while quietly sidelining the bad. Turns out, it’s just as effective with demanding customers as it is in therapy sessions. Let’s break it down:

# 1. Reward Calm Like It’s a Triple-Shot Miracle

If the customer manages to express their frustration calmly ...miraculously avoiding an all-caps meltdown... acknowledge it like the behavior MVP it is. “Thank you for letting me know! Let me fix this right away.” Translation: you’re rewarding them for keeping their temper in check with your swift, saint-like service.

Pro tip: Add a warm smile (or at least avoid glaring) to subtly reinforce their *rare* moment of self-control.

# 2. Don’t Reward the Screaming (Even If It’s Tempting to Just Make Them Go Away)

Let’s face it: the yelling, cup-waving spectacle is designed to demand priority service. But if you dive headfirst into appeasement mode without addressing *how* they’re asking, you’re basically training them to be louder next time. Instead, channel your inner therapist: keep your cool and gently redirect. “I understand you’re frustrated, and I want to help. Let’s sort this out.” Professionalism wins over chaos every time—or at least most of the time.

# 3. Redirect to a Happier Ending

Diffuse the situation with a solution that’s both empathetic and, dare we say, strategic. “It seems there was a mix-up. I’ll remake your drink just the way you ordered it, and let me add a pastry for the inconvenience.” Boom—problem solved, frustration redirected, and now they’re holding a croissant instead of rage.

Extra bonus: You’ve not only de-escalated the situation, but you’ve also positioned Starbucks as the coffee shop equivalent of a therapist’s couch.

# Takeaway: Who knew that a triple-shot, extra-foam, oat-milk meltdown could be turned into a teachable moment? By applying ABA principles like differential reinforcement, you can survive ... and maybe even thrive—in the wild world of customer service. Will it stop every coffee-fueled tantrum? Probably not. But hey, at least you’ll have the satisfaction of knowing you’re turning adult tantrums into opportunities for behavioral growth.

1htdhqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoetryWritingClub/comments/1htdhqg/alfred/,Alfred,"I met Alfred in the psych ward 2 days after I was admitted. Alfred is 78 years old and Alfred is chronically depressed. Alfred hates himself. We bonded quickly.
	“Who here's got a goddamn book I can read?!” He sounded like he'd been smoking his entire life.
	He was angry and old and annoying and he always stole people's fruit at lunch. But I just felt bad for him, and I honestly found his attitude to be quite understandable considering the circumstances. I gave him my copy of John Livingston seagull. He didn’t say thank you, instead he simply took the book, said alright, and sat back down at the only empty table in the room. He read it and I sat with him silently watching. I watched him laugh and laugh and laugh. He laughed so hard the nurses told him he needed to quiet down because one of the other patients was having ptsd. As I was watching him I remember how intensely I wanted to know his life story, what he went through, and the series of life events that led up to this current moment that I spend with him now. 
	It doesn’t matter what happens to somebody, what matters is how that person chooses to react, process, grow, and then transform the situation into something for themselves. Alfred was a complete asshole. I don’t care if your wife died because if my wife died I wouldn’t be going around the psych ward telling people how stupid they are because I got the vanilla creamer packet instead of the hazelnut. I don't actually know if his wife died, I don’t actually know anything about him. But Alfred raised hell over that god damn creamer packet. 
	“That's why you probably drink your coffee with over 15 sugars, like it's ok, you can admit you’re a stupid weirdo that doesn’t even like coffee. I'm fine without the creamer! I just like just black coffee! Because I'm not a pussy!”
	He sounded so sassy and annoyed when he said it. I found myself relating to Alfred and his quick remarks throughout the week, which was ironic because we have probably no similar interests. But I completely understand the hopelessness he must feel. I look at his eyes and see so much grief. I knew he was better than a grumpy old man, but he couldn’t figure it out. Speaking about humans in general, we tend to find false happiness in the comfort of being sad. It's hard as hell. 
	Eventually he stopped laughing and put the book down. 
	“Alright. It's weird how you’re sitting there just looking at me like that. Stop being weird, it's a good book, but I don’t like you and I want you to go to a different table.” 
	I knew he didn’t mind me, at least a little bit, because his tone was different when he spoke to me. It was lighter.
	“Don’t care. Do you want to help me prank Laura?” I asked very seriously. Laura is another patient here who doesn’t have any boundaries. She’s whiny, self entitled, and bitter. She’s somewhere in her mid 20s. He looked at me for a good 2 minutes before he said anything. I was patient, I sat there looking back at this wrinkly old man wondering what he’d been through. 
	About 20 minutes later the plan was set. We didn’t have much to work with, and we agreed we wanted the prank to be harmless to hopefully avoid any altercations involving the nurses. Except I had an idea. Every night Laura colors in the quiet room around 6pm. It's a part of her assigned mandatory routine. Alfred and I walked up to nurse Anderson at 6:25. 
	Nurse Anderson was fresh out of high school and somehow he ended up with the responsibility of watching over 15 insane 18-80 year olds. He was there through an internship he said. Anderson was the most nonchalant person I think I've ever met. One time two patients were full on wrestling and he simply stood there waving his hand at them 
	“Hey, don’t do that.” 
	He always sounded like he was trying to make his voice deeper and it wasn’t fooling me. I found him very easy to manipulate during my time in the ward. 
	Alfred asked Nurse Anderson to play The story of my life by the boyband One Direction on the TV in the quiet room so he could watch it after he got his snack. He put up one hell of an act. I had never seen this side of Alfred.
	“PLEASE!!!!!!!” He shouted, drawing others' attention “I’m 78 and I could die any minute now I just want to hear my FAVORITE song by my FAVORITE band because it's my ALL TIME FAVORITE THING EVER” He had me convinced. Anderson agreed as he shuffled behind the counter and put the song on the tv through the computer, he seemed overwhelmed. I think he only agreed because Alfred genuinely was scaring everyone in the room.
	Just like clockwork, Laura comes out of the room shrieking. I immediately knew we shouldn’t have done it. I heard her mention that her least favorite band ever was One direction. I thought it would be funny, I thought she would have her typical backhanded reaction, I never would’ve assumed what happened next. She was shaking and crying in a ball on the floor, shouting the lyrics to the song. Eventually she was sent to her room and nobody saw her the rest of the night. I overheard the nurses gossiping the next day, apparently Laura had a bunch of trauma related to One direction. We had triggered a severe ptsd panic attack. Hard to believe but to each their own, I guess. Laura clearly had deeper issues than I read her for. It really taught me alot about people. I hurt for her. It hurts me that I hurt her. 
	I remember the look on Alfred's face as he watched Laura shaking on the floor. I felt awful. Here I am trying to get this old man to see that life is fun only if you make it fun. I just gave him more trauma. I guess I should have considered the circumstances a little harder. 
To my surprise, the next morning Alfred sat next to me at breakfast. He looked very serious, not like his usual annoyed glare. 
	“Thank you.” He eventually said after looking at me for a moment. Before I could say anything he began again “That was the most fun I've had in the past year, making that plan and shit. Watching that annoying bitch cry on the floor. It's stupid this is stupid, but I know what you're trying to do and it's stupid, but it's nice.”
          The fact that Alfred enjoyed watching Laura go through something like that didn’t sit right with me, but honestly what was I expecting? I don’t really like Alfred, he’s not nice to other people because of his own issues. That's not cool, especially for somebody at the whopping age of 78. But I understand how it feels to be in that mindset. It's almost like you feel like you have nothing to lose so you give up. You give up on trying to be the person you want to be, all because you can't stop chasing yourself through miles in your own mind. Going through everything you've done wrong, every reason why you're an awful terrible person. Convincing yourself you've passed your peak and you've lost the only people who will ever care about you.  You feel like it's not that bad, but people like Alfred have no idea how good it can be. You have nothing to lose if you give yourself nothing to lose. I like writing because I can reflect on these past situations and write what I wish I could tell people. 
	“Take control of your life” I would've said “it can be so bad but why is that in itself a bad thing? There is power in somebody who can grow through their pain. Learn from it.” 
	We could've had a 3 hour long conversation that morning. For all I know, Alfred has no family, no friends, or nobody to go home to after he gets discharged. As I'm staring through my words rereading and recalling Alfred, I worry. I worry about Alfred and I worry about everything I can’t do to help him. I worry about Laura and her apparent attention seeking disorder. I tried my best to get through to Alfred. I don't want anybody to die alone or sad but at the end of the day that's not my responsibility. ​​​​​
	I guess what I learned through this experience is that it's not up to anybody else. Nobody is coming to save you, but you. I don't want to be like Alfred when I'm 78. I don't want to be like Laura when I'm 25. I don't want to be so miserable that I let the misery take over me. I won't let the sadness make me believe that I want to treat other people as poorly as I feel, I won't let it. But sometimes I remember how comfortable it feels to let it. Even though Alfred was a piece of work, I will never forget how he looked at me that morning. It was like we both realized together we weren't alone. Were sitting there with nothing in common. Somehow we were so much alike. Alfred showed me that everyone has more similarities than what first meets the eye. Never ever again will I judge another person. Not until I have a pretend 3 hour long conversation with them in the psych ward.

1htdgzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1htdgzg/dating_is_a_numbers_game_and_you_cant_escape_it/,"Dating is a numbers game, and you can’t escape it ","I’ve been here for a few days, and after reading another very thoughtful post about hours cyclical many folks can be about dating, I thought I’d offer some input on attitudes towards dating, especially us 40+ folk. 

As stated, dating is a numbers game. It’s super rare to find someone you’re very compatible with early on. In fact it’s downright impossible and should be met with skepticism. If you happen to go on one or try dates and suddenly you find someone who you feel really connected with, that’s a sign to take things really slowly and ask lots of questions. 

Dating is like buying a house, you usually have to look at lots of places before making a decision, and even then you’ll put in an offer and get rejected. You’re also never going to get everything you want, so you’ll have to figure out what your deal breakers are vs your wants. Do you want multiple bathrooms? Do you need a pool? What size kitchen are you looking for? Can you give up the dream of a home office if it means you’re getting everything else you desire? There’s a lot to consider. 

The people who find love easier likely cast as wider net. They are on more dating apps and put far less restrictions on there in order to speak to more people before making a decision to meet. They present a positive profile vs “please don’t have kids” “not interested in moms” “No Sagittarius men” etc.

It’s truly arrogant to believe you have a right to finding someone without doing the work. A lady I knew would get so worked up because she’d talk to one guy on an app, things didn’t materialize, so she’d delete the app throwing her hands in the air saying “this isn’t for me”. We old, baby, we’ve gotta go through the shit. 

If you’re a man on dating apps, get a woman to audit your profile. You won’t believe how eager they are to help you look good on there. Well lit pics, some full body ones, and you doing anything other than fishing, being in your car, standing next to your car, or on the couch. A bio is a must as well. Women are very weary of the low effort profiles. 

Ladies, your profile needs at least 3 pics. That’s it. 

First dates in the year of our lord Ryan Reynolds are no longer dinner at some fancy restaurant where you’ll be fake all night, and anxious if she’s just there to eat, or if he just wants to smash. Today’s modern dates are simple because they’re called a “vibe check”. It’s a quick interview to see if you want a proper second date. Coffee, drinks, almost anything that doesn’t involve food that has a waiter bringing it to you. If you’re one of those women who are “I won’t date without dinner” understand whom much is given, much is expected. You’re going to attract men who expect a place for his pickle later that night, so pick your poison. 

The reason for this change is options. We’ve all got way more options at the tip of our fingers now, so no need to go all out with the old fashioned person expecting a free meal date 1. It’s not the money either, couple drinks aren’t cheap these days. It’s the expectation. However, gentlemen, you’re also now paying for two dates this way, but so worth it because you weed out the shitty ones already making demands date 1. But here’s the best part…women over 35 almost ALWAYS demand paying for the next date if they’re having a great time. 

Dating is a process, and you’re going to have to go through all the checkpoints. Think of it as a funnel, and the swiping/meeting part is at the top, and it narrows down with each process. You’ll do lots of talking phases, then first dates, but few second dates, fewer third dates, even fewer genital dates, and then the rare dating phase. This is what it’s supposed to look like, and thinking otherwise is just setting yourself up for failure. 

Finally, it’s not about finding that one person out there for you. Reality is there are plenty of right ones, you just need to find one of them. If it doesn’t work out with this one, there’s another, I promise. You’re not undateable, you’re lazy and cynical. Big difference. 

Now go have some fun out there. 

Edit: many of you are unaware what “numbers game” means. It just means expect to do more activity and not be emotionally attached to the results. Going on one date thinking that’ll determine success isn’t smart. Going on many means more chances at finding the right person. It’s just a business term, not a term to say go be a slut.

1. If I follow the preset profile, does it come out as a concentrate or finished drink. Do I just add milk or cream of choice like a regular coffee or does it require more dilution?

2. What grain size should I use? I do have a burr grinder. 

3. How much do you guys make and how long will it stay in the refrigerator? 

General brewing questions
4. How important is the use of a scale? I don’t currently have one – is this an essential?

5. How important is the choice of water? I have tap water from the sink or filtered water from my refrigerator. Are either of these OK?

As an aside 
I just had the most delicious brew at a high-end restaurant called Buccan in Palm Beach.  It had hints of cinnamon and cayenne, and also dates,  almonds and cashews. I’m not usually a flavored coffee kind of person, but this was outrageous. If I try this, do you add the spices (cinnamon and cayenne) to the grind in the basket?

Then at around 5pm we found a cute coffee place and we stayed there for 2 hours and just talked. We talked about favorite movies, games, books we read as teenagers. 

By this time, we were a bit hungry so we looked for a ramen place since I was craving for something with soup and he was craving for some gyoza. 

Then after, we walked again, until 9pm, talking about extremely niche games we used to play as kids and stories about our travels. He was so cute 😭 The way he became animated talking about a 15 year old game.


We held hands at one point but we didnt kiss 🥹
I think i gained a friend but not exactly a boyfriend? Idk how this is supposed to go so i have no idea where we are 😭 

Idk i felt like i was into him more than he was into me.

I have always purchased ground coffee because I just didn't want to go through the trouble of hand grinding my coffee. I read a lot about how it significantly changes the whole coffee experience but couldn't get myself to go through the whole process. Last month I gave in and bought 1zpresso Q2, and my mind is blown. The experience is similar to what I have had at roasteries and cafes. The coffee I used was La Colombe Nizza medium roast I picked up from US (yes, please judge me). I have enjoyed their ground coffees before, so figured I'll give their coffee beans a try - and I was not disappointed.

Happy to learn any tips or suggestions on some good brewing practices or coffees that you found were helpful. 

P.s.: I am based in Delhi, India - if that helps you in suggesting specialty coffees that I should give a try.",9,1735993085.0,pourover,7,1.0,False

1htd7wm,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/1htd7wm/depo_shot_side_effects/,Depo shot side effects,"Hello, 

I had a miscarriage back in August and due to fertility risks with my body, I got on what I felt was a more garenteed birth control bc unplanned pregnancy isn’t very safe for me now- and I’m not very pill savvy, I’ve already tired the implant and it sucks! So I thought why not.

Since getting it, I’ve had two rounds. My sex drive has died, like no desire of any kind, have to take supplement to feel like my old self type of bad (had a much higher sex drive before, this is very odd for me). I’m so tired! Cant survive without coffee in the morning and by 6pm I’m ready to pass out anyways (if I don’t by 8pm, my whole next day is extreme tired vs normal tired). I bleed a LOT, when my miscarriage bleeding ended I instantly started a period less than a month later and it didn’t stop over 2 months, and now I have my period again since 3.5 weeks ago with just constant mild bleeding and cramping (bummed me out cause I had one period between these two that was normal and 10 days only but then excessive bleeding again this month!). I’m always bloated, more sensitive stomach than before, so lots of foods mess with my digestive track. And the moods! I’ve never been so snappy and angry for nothing, I’m more depressed, insecure and anxious in areas I’m usually not. Very sensitive these days, takes anything and nothing to make me mad or cry panic mode.

Like is this normal? I was hoping for the no period effect, help with hormones and protection for my body with the health issues I have but this seems like a high price for a married woman who used to love being all over her husband and having a busy career life. Now I struggle to exist and feel desire or be period free 😭 

is this anyone else’s experience? If so or not, what was your experience on the shot?",1,1735993029.0,birthcontrol,1,1.0,False

Here though it feels entirely different asking someone even a simple question or initiating small talk feels like scaling a mountain maybe it’s the change of culture or perhaps it’s the fear of rejection in a place where I haven’t quite found my footing whatever it is it’s been isolating I long for the kind of connections that make a place feel like home but figuring out how to rebuild that sense of community and camaraderie when every step feels daunting has been a challenge I never expected

1htd756,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1htd756/i_had_a_massive_panic_attack/,I had a massive panic attack. ,"Good morning, for context, this happened about 5-6 months ago. I work in the funeral industry and have been responsible for organizing and executing funeral honors for deceased veterans. This is a job I’m extremely good at, like to do, and take great pride in, and I’ve done upwards of a thousand. 

I’ve always had depression and was diagnosed with generalized anxiety in addition when I sought treatment, but it didn’t feel like it really “fit” me. I’ve always been a tightly-wound person, and with hindsight, a lot of my involuntary bodily twitches seem to align with that diagnosis, but it was hard for me to accept. 

Anyway, the incident. I was getting ready to do my last funeral of the day, and I was sitting in my van with coworkers minutes before we needed to get staged. All of the sudden, my entire left arm went numb, I was nauseous, I felt sick to my stomach, I had an intense chest pain, and my heart was beating out of my chest. My coworkers were even able to see my chest jutting out, violently. I thought it was a heart attack, but I was clear of mind and was determined to finish the service. I’m used to performing under pressure, and I executed the service as if everything was fine. 

We immediately drove to the ER, running lights, while I kept pumping my left fist, doing breathing exercises, and talking myself through it. I passing my now-wife’s number off so they can inform my family, and had my other coworker call our boss to explain the situation. 

I had these symptoms for an hour and a half, until the nurses put me to sleep. When I woke up and talked about my medical history, they told me it was a panic attack. I was a healthy 23 when it happened, so I thought it was improbable but I didn’t have any other explanation. I’ve had panic attacks before, I got them frequently as a teenager, but not like this. 

Ever since it happened, I found a doctor that prescribed me a medication that prevents these, and also reduced the amount of twitches I’ve been having. I’m terrified of getting my heart rate up, now. I’ve been dodging almost all caffeine, and working out, something I love, has been difficult because I keep feeling my heart rate increase and it reminds me of the hour and a half of sheer pain. 

Has anyone else had similar experiences? I’ve had a doctor question why they ruled out a heart attack because, they did an x-ray, heard I had anxiety, and told me it definitely wasn’t a heart attack. It didn’t help them when I confessed that I had a cup of coffee on the way. ",2,1735992942.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

1htd6r3,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmint/comments/1htd6r3/linux_very_slow_compared_to_windows_cant_make/,Linux very slow compared to windows. can't make sense of this.,"So i have an old acer predator helios lap. The main display of the laptop is broken and i am working with an external monitor. I installed the linux mint yesterday and it was great. It was performing really good. It was using the opensource neuovea driver for my nvidia gpu back then. I was getting really high temperature for the motherboard then (80-90 celcius).

I switched to nvidia 470. Now the weird things start to happen. If i use the ""Joined displays"" option and disable my main laptop monitor. It becomes laggy as hell (i can't click on buttons type of slow, if i move the mouse i have to wait a while to get the monitor update for it kind of slow). If i switch back to the mirrored display with my laptop display. It kind of gets faster but still little slower(no 144hz refresh rate i think) than the open source driver i think. What is happening in these situations? Is there a way to only use the intel integrated gpu for both main display and external display ?

TLDR: neuovea nvidia driver was heating my laptop but it was fast. Switched to nvidia 470 and now the system is slow as hell when using joined displays. But is faster in mirrored display (but i am still not getting the 144hz smoothness).

No other job makes you 'labor share' from your job duties; I think I read an example here on Reddit. 

'The accountant doesn't get sent to fetch coffee, the sales person doesn't get sent to work the production warehouse, the administrative assistant doesn't get sent to do the groundskeeping'  

Actually with a union if you get assigned a job duty that isn't part of your job description a shop steward or union representative comes to the manager and yells at them 'find someone else to do that job, that's not his job!' 

If Amazon really wants to do Labor Share it has to be designed in this way:  
 1. Labor Share is voluntary not mandatory  
 2. Only the associates manager can offer Labor Share to them.  
 3. Labor Share is incentivized with higher pay ($2 more per hour)

1htd5eq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1htd5eq/bringing_in_other_people/,Bringing in other people,"Hey, so there's this guy I'm seeing. It's either a really intense friendship or a partnership - he does a lot of stuff we would do in a partnership, minus the physical intimacy, and our mutual friends have asked about how close we are. Our main mutual seems to think he likes me but is holding back, as it would be a gay relationship. Anyways point is, we spend a lot of time together just the two of us - pretty much 6 to 12 hours almost every day for the last two months. We're also next door neighbors, being part of a very close knit community of houses, kind of a communal living situation

Anyways, the night before yesterday I sent him a text about how much I trust him etc cause some of my friends have been telling me to be careful lately as he ""switched"" on me one night, becoming verbally aggressive - a night he claims not to remember as we had been drinking (it was my birthday). I txted him night before yesterday saying that I know the real him, I know he's a good person and I'll never abandon him (on New Years Eve we spent the night at his and he said he was afraid I'd end up deserting him at some point like everyone else does)

Also something really sweet he's started doing is cooking me food. It's been awkward as all my food is in his fridge so I have to wait until we meet that day to access it. But he always cooks the greatest food, so it works out well. And I even mentioned in the txt how much I appreciate the food

Well yesterday, he said that he'll be cooking for one of the other neighbors now as well. When we went for morning coffee, he had invited a bunch of people around - usually it's just the two of us. I felt a little weird at the lack of a headsup (I haven't mentioned anything about it to him as it would make me sound jealous) so I went home after the coffee. Another reason I went home is cause he said he had watched four episodes ahead in the show we're watching, despite the fact that he said to me the day before I could watch ahead if I want (it's a show he's seen before) and I said I wouldn't watch without him as we're watching it together. Even one of mutuals at coffee told him that that's cheating - the moment he mentioned watching it, she said it. He seemed completely surprised at this

Anyways yesterday when it was time for dinner, he texted me to tell me to invite my nearest housemate to join us. The housemate wasn't available. When I got to pwBPD's, he said that two other friends (a couple) and the friend he'd also be cooking for this weekend were unavailable. Then throughout the meal, he barely said a word. There was a very strange vibe in the air?

I left after that. Txted him asking was there a strange vibe or was I overthinking, and he said that it was my overthinking (that's something he's called me out on a lot)

That night another neighbor called me over, to have some ""sugar"" - something I got introduced to when first meeting pwBPD. He also invited pwBPD over. pwBPD kept telling him he should let him cook for him one week. Again, until yesterday this cooking for me was very much something I viewed as special between the two of us. I know it's stupid to get upset at it but he kept bringing people in yesterday, right in front of me. There was also one point where he mentioned the show Good Omens and said the show was written by one of his favorite authors, Terry Pratchett. I told him the show was done by Neil Gaiman (a former favorite author of mine) and he said the show was done by both of them (truthfully, the show was NG - the books came from both) Didn't really know how to respond so said nothing. Then he said this silence is very eerie. Other guy said the place had definitely gotten quiet during the winter and pwBPD said that people can sense when there's a strange vibe in the room (vibe being the exact word I asked him about in regards to dinner) He left shortly after that

Then around an hour later, pwBPD texted me asking was I still in the guy's room. I said I had gone home. He asked me could I throw him one of the bags but that we wouldn't be chilling as a mutual friend had just finished visiting him and pwBPD's dog had gotten growly. Dude expected me to throw him 100 worth of my stuff, have it all himself and not hang out with me when he had been okay with chilling with someone else? Plus the dog loves me
I told him no - that I share bags, I don't give them away. That the bags would probably still be there next time he actually wants to chill as sugar wasn't an addiction for me, company is what makes me happy
He said he could pop up to mine for a bit but at that point I was so in my head about everything so said let's leave it off, at which point he agreed to let's have a sesh on Monday instead

I told him I need some alone time, so don't worry about me and food tomorrow. He said I can have space and still eat, he'll drop dinner up to me. I thanked him and said he was a good friend, I've just been thinking weirdly all day, to which he said it's cause we had so much alcohol New Years Eve that our thoughts can be fuzzy afterwards

***
How does this whole scenario sound? It's weird he became a mindfuck again the morning after I told him I trust him completely. It's weird he's suddenly started inviting everyone into our things and seems uncomfortable now being alone in a room with me. And tbh, I'm kind of thinking I should just skip food today. All my food's at his but him suddenly getting everyone else involved has kind of ruined how special I found it. Not going to txt him to call off dinner (he'll just say I need to eat) but if he goes knocking on my door with it, I'll pretend not to be home",3,1735992749.0,BPDlovedones,2,0.81,False

The way to get there is always the same (up the road) and the shop's interior always looks the same as well. It doesn't exist in waking life but rather, it seems to be an echo of memories. Like an amalgamation of multiple shops and cafes I worked at or frequented over my life time in different cities. It's always bustling with customers who appear as a blur to me unless I interact with them, then they come into focus. Lol the service is always questionable and the manager is always the same guy and kinda of a rude jerk to staff and customers. 
I just woke from another visit to this place (and never did get my americano and cherry pastry) and can't help but wonder what the hell this is. Astral business? Do you experience something similar? What are your thoughts on this? ",2,1735992659.0,AstralProjection,2,1.0,False
