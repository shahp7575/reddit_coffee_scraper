""It's more...the nature of these things. The nature of the beast, yknow? My nature.""

She sits down her mug and takes a deep look into my eyes. It's the first time I've really looked into them in months. The golden brown honey I'm used to is replaced with deep blackness. Like that guy says in Jaws, ""black eyes...lifeless, like a doll's eyes."" I can feel her gaze piercing into me and my skin begins to crawl. It's only now I've begun to realize the danger I've put myself in. 

""Didn't you see this coming? Didn't you see the signs? You can't have honestly believed someone who's put you through such gymnastics could do what they do...if they were human."" She stretches her hand out and starts stroking the back of mine with her finger. That scaly, dry skin is resting on mine like a Brillo pad. I can't break her stare. It's hypnotic.

""I...I could tell you were different,"" I stammer, as I notice saliva begin dripping from the corners of her lips, slowly curling into a smile. ""But w-why? Why me?"" As her finger navigates its way up to my wrist and her hand ensnares itself around my lower forearm, it becomes extremely clear what's about to happen: I'm going to be eaten alive.

""Honey, it's just my nature. Since I've lived, I've needed people just like you."" Her grin stretches further. ""People who have much to offer in the range of devotion. People with a soul."" Her grip tightens to a vice around my arm as her other shoots up to pin down mine to the coffee table. ""When you gave me that ring, you gave me just what I needed. Not just your flesh, your essence. Your supranatural self."" Her teeth begin slowly sharpening and serrating themselves as she slowly rises from her seat. ""What you have was taken from me a long, long time ago and I have to have so many of you to keep going. Very few of you learn the reality of what I am. You did."" Her grin contorts into an annoyed, discomforting look. ""Normally, I'd have already ripped you to shreds and sucked down your spark, but sometimes,"" she grips harder, ""that spark brings awareness. That awareness is dangerous. It disrupts my hunting grounds.""

She leans down closely, sniffing me, almost like she's savoring my scent. ""Mmmmm. You'll be gamy. I like that."" Sweat begins pouring down my brow and my hands go clammy. ""Don't take it personal,"" she prods, ""it's all business. A girl's gotta eat.""",1,1740564209.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

I assume an appropriate approach is a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined as \`gestalts´.",2,1740563631.0,ArtificialSentience,1,1.0,False

I have worked as a chef in a commercial kitchen (food to order from websites). It became extremely overwhelming due to workload per person in the past few weeks and I literally started panicking et . whenever an evening came and I knew I have to go there the next morning.
I was under an enormous amount of stress basically, could barely sleep for a few weeks and so on and simply know that I won't be able to work 1 more day is said place. I honestly fel like a miserable s*it working there recently and the ignorant and very sarcastic new management wasn't helping my mental health either.

Anyway, I gave my resignation letter last Friday. The notice period is 4 weeks. 
I have been out sick due to work related stress for slightly over a week now.

I started applying to coffee shops instead. 

I know personally that this environment was and will be FAR less stressful for me; I've worked in coffee shops for quite a few years in the past and ended up in this current place simply due to being desperate while job hunting.
I have just received an offer for an assistant manager position, but I would be starting from Monday or Tuesday at the latest next week.

The coffee shop in question is a small, private shop which isn't getting very busy etc. as I have been going there personally for quite some time to grab a coffee.

Could anyone possibly help me in this situation? What are my options? I have already mentioned in the resignation letter that I give it due to ""personal problems"" and that I will provide a doctor's note for the notice period.
I'm supposed to have a GP call appointment due to work stress/anxiety sometime today.

I'd really appreciate some help, as I was never in such a situation before, but maybe someone else was and could potentially help me.
Thank you all in advance.

You’re out and about, minding your own business, maybe even trying to enjoy a lovely day, when suddenly you spot it: a coin lying on the ground, glinting up at you like it’s the last piece of treasure on Earth. And let me tell you, this is where the inner turmoil begins!
First of all, why is it always a one-cent or a five-cent coin? You’d think the universe could at least drop a quarter or something halfway decent! But no, it’s almost like they put out the universal law of “the shinier it looks, the more worthless it is.” So here you are, contemplating whether to pick up this minuscule piece of change, weighing your self-respect against the possibility of a whopping five cents!
And let’s talk about that internal debate—I mean, should I bend down and grab it? What will people think? Are they judging me? “Look at that desperate person scrounging for pennies!” It’s a coin, not a smartphone I dropped! But then again, every cent counts, right? Even that fraction of a dollar could one day contribute to a true fortune! Or, you know, a cheap coffee. Either way, this is a conflict worthy of a Shakespearean tragedy!
Then, there’s the grim reality that comes with picking it up. Is it even sanitary? Are there germs galore on this thing? But oh no, now I’m caught in a cycle of guilt and curiosity. It’s just sitting there, taunting me as if it knows I’m torn between disgust and frugality. And let’s not forget the silent judgment of passersby. I swear, there’s always someone nearby watching, and I can practically hear their thoughts: “Wow, they really will stoop that low for a nickel.” Thanks, society, for shaming me for being a financially savvy scavenger!
And if you decide to ignore it, you’ll probably kick yourself later, thinking about what could have been. “That coin could’ve been my lucky charm!” It’s utterly maddening! You could have saved it from a lifetime of loneliness on the sidewalk, but no! You got swept up in the drama of public perception and the tragedy of indecision.
In conclusion, finding a coin on the ground is a comedic tragedy wrapped in societal expectation, hygiene concerns, and existential reflection. So the next time you come across that shiny little piece of metal, just remember: it’s not just a coin. It’s a philosophical conundrum waiting to happen!",2,1740563422.0,radioheadcirclejerk,0,1.0,False

1iyjwcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/counttheheadlights/comments/1iyjwcd/26_february_2025/,"26 February, 2025","It's 8:21 PM and I'm sitting on my bed in the motel I'm staying at. All day I sung the song of loneliness, picked at food and threw it back up, fed the ravens, sat by the pool, tried not to get down.

I try to write and create, caress the words in my head. But I am stuck in a cycle, of pain, of misery, and the worst thing about these cycles is they are spinning you around and you can't even see how.

The man I once loved is a nightmare. He holds me like hostage. I loved him but I must go free, but tell me how to go free. For i cannot figure it out. I just run right back again and shout, ""I love you"" when I really only hate myself.

Give me a day or two, I'll come up with something. I'm so overtired. I don't need a rest, I just need a little comforting.

The soul I used to know is gone, long gone, it's dead. I wish that I could tell you but I can't so I just scream inside my head. I scream inside my head. I know you'd love me anyway, but I failed. And I can't live with that. What do I do, you know?

The scabs all over my legs... on my face, on my hands, on my skin, so dry and brittle. How I wish that I was free of all the things that I never wanted in the first place. Every day since I was born has been a mistake. Set me free and let me go so I can fly.

This is not a diary, this an ode to what is right. I wish my boyfriend would stay with me tonight, I need a boyfriend who cares about my life. I have a coffee by the pool, do a little journalling and ask myself some questions, ""what do I really want?"" ""What do I need?"" ""what  I missing?"" And out the back I go to feed the ravens, the ravens swim in puddles on the ground and eat the hot cross buns I throw them, shadily and steadily, creatures so heavy breasted, dark spirited creatures of the night. I love them, I do, I do!

I ask myself what do I need, the answer's clear: it's peace. But how do I get peace without the freedom from the man who made me cry? I fear I'll never get to see and smell and hear again, I'm so afraid of what he has to hide.

But I'll be brave and I will set myself free. Even if tomorrow never comes I'll more happily knowing that without the hands around my throat I can never scream. I don't know what this means...

This is a creative writing exercise, I'm tired, I'm scared, the night is dark outside. I don't want to go bed, I have nothing else to do, I don't love anybody, and I feel like shit every day. I don't know what to do. This keeps playing in my head, I don't know what to do! i don't know what to do! I said, I said...!

It's okay to play...

I just wish for five minutes of peace. The cacophony inside my head is simply unmanageable. I don't the want the drugs, but without them... what am I without them? What could I be with them? I don't want to be a zombie. I don't want to k!!! myself either.

I forget everything immediately. It's very difficult. I can't even spell properly or see words right. I don't know if I'm losing my brain function or just think I am, but from my perception every day I get stupider and more dumb and less smart.

Earlier I was thinking of good stuff to help me in life... oh yeah, what I am now versus what I want to be. And what is happening and what is offered, etc.

I am in a motel room because I am functionally homeless. (It's a nice motel with a big pool and friendly people.)

I am eating like shit because I'm extremely stressed even though not much is there to stress me. (It's just Oscar.)

I am daydreaming and fantasizing about different lives, in a forest hut with ravens, in America with Rev or Jimmy, living with Oscar, being a neuropsychology researcher/worker, making music.

I am unable to sing because my voice is broken, my vocal cords are lesioned and/or paralyzed.

I am deeply, deeply, bone tired and frequently wish that everything was over. (Yes, like that.)

I am scared to death of my family and every other human in the world. I think they are all out to get me and could attack me at any minute and my energy is so frantic and fragile I am rather intensely prone to suggestion.

Because I can't speak/sing properly, I can't express myself, so my whole heart and chest and body is wrung up with grief and loss and emotion that I cannot share. (It's fucking awful.)

I am planning on extending my motel stay until I can move into the garage at mum's where I can get paid on disability and live freely for a while, sleeping and eating and resting and sorting stuff out. (I feel like I could sleep for a year.)

I am drinking excessive cups of decaf coffee and eating lollies and snacks obsessively to drown out the horrors. (The nerve pain. The situation.)

I am feeling like between me and life is a sheet of unbreakable glass. (i feel like I'll never get through.)

I am keeping on going right now. (What else can I do?)",1,1740562992.0,counttheheadlights,0,1.0,False

So, what exactly is a VPN? 🤔

  
[Read My Blog on VPN to Learn More.](https://jaytillu.com/blogs/what-is-a-vpn-in-networking) 

🔹 **Think of it as an invisibility cloak for your internet traffic.**  
🔹 It **encrypts** everything you send and receive, making it unreadable to snoopers.  
🔹 It **hides your IP address**, so websites, advertisers, and even your government can’t track you.  
🔹 It **lets you bypass restrictions**—ever wanted to watch Netflix shows only available in another country? A VPN can make it happen!

# 🔥 Why You NEED a VPN:

✅ **Total Privacy** – No more creepy targeted ads following you.  
✅ **Security on Public Wi-Fi** – Hackers **love** free coffee shop Wi-Fi. A VPN keeps them out.  
✅ **Bypass Geo-Blocks** – Watch content from **anywhere** in the world.  
✅ **Safer Remote Work** – Securely access your company’s network from home.

  
💡 **But Beware!** Not all VPNs are created equal. Free VPNs **may sell your data** or slow down your speed. Choose a **trusted** provider for real protection.

I am currently combi feeding and we are soon to take our first flight with our 5 month old (Ryan air - Stansted airport)

It is very likely that he will need a formula bottle during the flight and I have never done that. I was planning to either take a thermos with hot boiling water with me along with a bottle of room temperature boiled water and do the hot shot method, or simply ask a coffee shop for boiled water ( the one they use for teas) just after we pass the checks and prepare his bottle 30 mins in advance and let it cool down.

Does on the checks, let you move on with the pre-filled flasks or they empty them?

Do they open these to take sample for testing? How then the water remains sterilised after?

Will the open the brand new formula tin for testing?

Ps. We can’t use the ready to drink bottles as my son is on aptamil pepti

""So...."" Shea tilts her head left as she walks besides Marcus.

""So."" Marcus responded unamused.

""Tell me more about yourself!"" The Dryad beams with energy.

Marcus suppresses an groan and just rolls his eyes. It had been a few hours since they left the hive and the monotony of travel has already got to her. ""I don't know, what do you want to know?""

""Hmmm..."" Shea taps her chin with her index finger a few times. ""Why'd you start traveling.""

*""Ooof, loaded question from the start...""* Marcus braces himself. ""Well, uh... I needed to get out there and see the world for myself...! And... And-""

""And?"" The Dryad gestures to him to keep going.

""And... I got in a argument with my friends..."" He admits.

""Ooooh"" Her tone grows infuriatingly teasing. ""And they've kicked you out\~?""

""Tch. Yeah, they- he did! There, happy?"" Marcus snaps.

""OOooohhh what'd you do? Did you sneak into their rooms, hmmm? You said 'he', didn't know you swung that-""

""SHEA!""

""Uhm, sorry...""

Marcus sighs, cutting a few vines and thorns obstructing their path. ""I don't know, I guess I was just being pissy at the time and he, Alex, rightfully got fed up with my shit.""

""You aren't sure?"" Her tone returns to normal.

""Wh- I'm not a spectator of my own life, but- that seems like it.""

Shea humms in understanding, figuring to let the subject drop. ""Who made your armour and weapons? You said you went to the corruption to get materials- did one of your friends make it?""

""Ah, no, I did."" Marcus answers matter-of-factly.

""What? Y-You?"" The plant woman could not hide the disbelief in her voice.

""Yup, sure did. I do most mining, wood cutting, even building back home too.""

The Dryad gasps. ""Then what does everyone else do?""

""Hm... I guess Alex cooks and just does other odd jobs around, Eugene deals with every sort of business or transaction, and Nicole knows alchemy.""

""M-Marcus... That's-... Are they taking advantage of you?"" Shea points out.

""Hmm... Nah."" Was his only answer. ""Now, your turn, tell me something about you- uhm... How's life being a Dryad?""

Shea actually seems to genuinely take this question seriously, going into such deep rumination that she nearly walks straight first into thorny vines- but, to Marcus' chagrin they just open up a path for her. ""I've always liked nature and being outside, so I guess not a lot changed.""

Marcus nodded expectantly. And he waited, and waited, and waited. ""That's it?"" The adventurer raises an eyebrow.

""Yup."" Shea chirps.

""And you didn't just leave out a lot of stuff that I'd be a lot more curious about?"" Marcus held in a sigh.

""Hmmm... Nope!""

He ran a hand across his face, the cold demonite seemingly putting a bit of colour back in it. ""My fault for asking I guess..."" Marcus whispers. ""Anyhow, how about you teach me that Vanity spell already.""

...

*""Chilly as always in Valzarath.""* Trevon stares out of the window of his house at the snow and how it falls, the odd person walking the stone roads or at the flickering of lights inside other buildings. It had been a day since they've returned with the spoils from the corruption and hoh boy did they help. *""They should keep us afloat for a while longer.""* He sighs. Trevon despised the fact that they had to go get more valuables themselves, their economy still wasn't fully self-sufficient. It was fine for most of the year, but when winter hit, the already frosty plains of the tundra became so much more cold. *""If only there was a something to get those noble bastards off our tail for good.. I'd need a miracle though-""*

The door of his office slams open, causing the arm's dealer to snap his gaze at the person who just entered. ""B-Boss!"" It was Kyle, Trevon's right hand, and he looks like he'd just seen a ghost. ""It's a miracle! The daughter of- their daughter, Rosetta, is here in Valzarath!"" The man nearly trips on his words but gets out the important information.

Trevon's eyes widen and jaw opens wide. ""WHAT?!""

\-

Trevon and Kyle hide behind a building and they carefully watch princess Rossetta. She had pink hair, a pink fluffy coat, golden jewelry with gemstones. A regal purple-pinkish dress wraps the rest of her body, concealing her white heels. On her head there is fluffy hat, matching with the coat on which rests a platinum tiara. Bright blue eyes, like the sky, scan around the area for interesting shops or people to talk to.

""Why the hell is she here?!"" Trevon whispers to Kyle.

""Dunno Boss, but we might think it's because of wedding of Isaac Brianad.""

""Shit."" Trevon cursed unnecessarily, he was really tense. *""Two guards are with her but this is still a golden opportunity... Should- Should we capture her? Ask Valzarath for ransom? Would those bastards even care? Wait.... Would they care too much? Send an small private corp to 'deal with us'? No, it's too risky, but I have to do something- something""* An idea pops into Trevon's head and he can't help but let out a small smile. ""Kyle, stay here and notify the others to be on standby, I'll go talk with her.""

""B-Boss?! Be careful!""

Inconspicuously wrapping around some buildings, Trevon walks into an alleyway and makes it seem like it just so happened that he bumps into her. He mutters an weak apology then when he gets a good look at her, acts like a deer caught in headlights. For just a moment though, because the next, he gets back his composure.

""Ahem, hello there miss. You seem... rather 'important' to be walking around with guards in Valzarath, can I help you with anything?"" Giving a polite bow and using his most gentlemanly tone, Trevon strikes up an conversation with the princess.

""Oh, hello!"" Her voice is like rays of sunshine, somehow. ""I am princess Rosseta, of Duke and Duchess Taltos. I have found myself with some time to kill before I go to Rockwell for some official business."" Rossetta nodded. ""Valzarath is big and I wanted to ask for directions, but there seems to be nobody around to talk to."" She carried herself with elegance and gentleness, Trevon wonders how someone like her comes from cold-hearted pieces of shit.

*""Of course everyone seems busy, everybody knows you and nobody wants to talk with you out of fear!""* Trevon screams internally. ""Ah, that's so tragic to hear. Say, your highness, I, Trevon, owner of 'Guns & Weapons', would be glad to give you some pointers."" The arms dealer does another polite bow. ""I happen to know my dear city very well.""

""Oh, I've heard about you!"" The pink princess claps with an ever widening smile. ""Your shop is the most successful with outside merchants! Then, I'll be in your care.""

Trevon resists breaking away his act. *""That easily? Is she naïve?? Do the guards have nothing to say about this- Oh, they are two hunks of muscle decorated in shiny armour, powerful yeah, but they don't seem to give two flying shits about the person they're escorting. As expected of those good for nothing nobles.""* He smiles gently. ""It would be my honour. First, if you haven't seen it, the central plaza is...""

It was a long evening of sight-seeing for the princess. They've must've been to every inch and corner of Valzarath, she had an nigh unquenchable curiosity and was just so brimming with energy the whole way through, but Trevon finally got the information he desired out of her. Through a slip up there, a simple response here. Firstly, confirmation that she was indeed invited to Isaac Brianad's wedding. Secondly, that her parents are indeed unaware of all of the shady business he's done for Valzarath. And thirdly, she's really gullible, or impressionable- the last one he just inferred

""Thanks again for showing me around, Trevon."" Rosetta takes a sip of hot chocolate. They've stopped at café, a real hole in the wall, but if it isn't his favorite locale.

""No problems, your highness."" He himself has a cup of coffee. ""It's so sad such an important occasion has to rip you away from your studies, at least you can now say you've visited Valzarath."" And fourthly, she's a damn good mage, still studying back in Chripis though.

""Haha, that's right..."" Even her laugh is melodious like idyllic ambiance of a forest. The princess purses her lips, like she wants to say something.

""Something on your mind?"" Trevon takes another sip of the coffee- good as always.

""Ah, just... My parents will be very busy talking politics and whatnot, so... I'll be mostly alone..."" She was embarrassed to say it, looking cute in the process. ""W-What I'd like to say, would you accompany me? I know you are a busy man...""

Trevon slaps the table and tries his best to not choke. ""A-Are you sure, your highness? Y-You've just met me today?"" He gives her a serious look. *""HAHAHAHAH! I'VE DONE IT!!! TREVON YOU CUNNING PIECE OF WORK!!!! SOON VALZARATH WILL BE MINE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA!!!!!""*

Rosetta nods. ""You've been nothing but helpful to me today. And not only that people might actually know you due to your business. Plus... I can just tell, you are a good person, Trevon."" She smiles, so radiant, so pure. A smile so kind so warm you'd find no qualm in confiding in it without a second thought.

""It... It would be my upmost honour."" The black man wipes his eyes of tears that are not there.

...

The backdrop of the jungle quietly fades into nothing as Marcus concentrates on the feeling Shea's been pointing him towards for the past few hours. Soon enough, he grabs ahold of it, and can finally open his eyes.

""Uhg, finally! Little kids do magic better than you."" Shea gets up and stretches. Marcus could swear he heard the sound of a twig snapping coming from her joints, but writes it off as imagination.

Marcus got comfortable on the ground in a meditative stance as he tries his darnest to listen to the asinine instructions Shea gave him.

""Whatever, at least I pulled it off, even with your tips."" Looking down at his body, he is currently wearing his silver amour, when in reality he has the shadow armour equipped. Even his accessories could be 'hidden', no more looking ridiculous with blue boots and a purple armour. Though, Marcus does know manners ""Thanks.""

""Yeah, no problem."" The Dryad sounds more irritated than anything. ""What next?""

""Well, I need four more heart crystals-""

""You didn't even have all fifteen-, ah, no use in arguing with you. I can probably sense some if we're close."" She gestures towards Marcus to follow her, as foliage wraps around her as to not hit or hinder her, again.

""Well, I didn't need to cut all of those weeds constantly then did I..."" Marcus mutters and follows her.

A few more hours pass, and with Shea acting as compass, Marcus finally attains the fifteenth heart crystal, finally topping himself off. They have gotten into trouble a dozen times at least in the process: bats, bees, snappers, slimes; and Shea, without fail, kicked her feet up and let Marcus do all of the work, because 'she's tired after healing Marcus so much earlier today'. Still though, they left the underground jungle in one piece and Marcus could finally see the bright sun- er, nevermind, it was the dead of night. They planned along the way that their next destination was Southsworn.

""Ah, I don't want to travel during the night, I wonder if I can stay at Fahd's again..."" Marcus looks around and remembers the direction to the tinker's house.

""Who is..."" The Dryad didn't even have time to finish her question.

""A goblin, really good with tinkering stuff, made my boots. Oh, and don't worry, he won't snitch.""

""Sure...""

Sometimes Shea still looked a bit besides herself, she did see Marcus half-dead just a few hours ago. If that was her, she'd be resting for a few days at least, so it must mean this isn't the first time that it happened to Marcus. Snapping back, she continues tailing after him, he walked so fast.

...

""M-M-M-M-M-M-Marcus?!"" Fahd glasses fall off as his jaw hits the floor.

""Heya buddy, can I crash over for tonight? I'll leave tomorrow morning, won't be bothering you anymore."" The hooded young man gave the biggest smile he could fit on his face, knowing full well he was intruding over Fahd's, not like he would mind, he kept working very late anyway.

""Bb-h---h---"" The goblin is a stuttering mess. ""Wh--- Why-!! Why is the Dryad with you!!!!!""

""Ah, she's following me-ack"" She slapped him over the back of his head. ""I mean, we're a team now.""

""T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-Teammm????"" Fahd's mind races a kilometer a minute.

""Yup, and he's taking me out on a date in Southsworn!"" The one in question does a cutesy face, one to which he only glared at, not having the energy left to argue.

""T-......"" Marcus could swear he saw the goblin's spirit leaving his body.

He picks up the tinkerer's glasses, puts them on his face, pats him on the shoulders and solemnly says. ""Thanks for letting me stay the night.""

...

Loud banging on the door stirs Gazgul awake from his slumber. ""Who dares?!"" He yells out, groggily getting out of his sleeping area on the ground. With loud steps he swings the door open so hard he knocks over the poor goblin at his door. Then, he grabs him by the collar of his flimsily sewn shirt and glares death into his eyes.

""W-We've spotted the Dryad, Chieftain!"" The small goblin shuts his eyes and silently prays to his late God to spare him from death.

""And what motivated you numbskull to wake me up when you could've told me when I woke up!"" Gazgul growled.

""Chief, she is that human you l-let roam the jungle!"" The pale in the face goblin blurted out.

The chieftain freezes and releases his grip on the goblin, letting him fall to the ground. ""And what are you implying with that? The Dryad's home is the jungle, interacting with that airhead means nothing."" A second later he recovers. Gazgul starts dreading an awful possibility. ""Where is she right now?""

""That's the thing, they're hiding in the foliage, even our best scouts had an hard time spotting them.""

The large goblin curses. ""Do we have a rough idea where they are? If so, then have that area surrounded. I must talk with her myself."" Gazgul points making the small goblin to scurry away. *""Firstly she avoids us for the longest time, then she hides from on the surface? Were she not a Dryad I'd immediately guess she would want to leave the jungle... No, I must see her myself.""*

A little about me:

📖 I love world-building and have probably started thousands of stories, though finishing them is another matter entirely! One day, I’d love to write a solar-punk slice-of-life fantasy with Studio Ghibli vibes, something about everyday people just trying to live a good, meaningful life. I prefer stories about regular people over “chosen ones,” and I read *a lo*t of fanfiction across all sorts of genres.

☕ You’ll usually find me reading history books (currently on A History of Private Life, Vol. 1: From Pagan Rome to Byzantium), drinking too much coffee with oat milk, or editing vintage house plans for fun; even if they’d never work in real life. It’s oddly meditative.

🧠 I have been diagnosed with ADHD and likely autism (several therapists have suggested I get tested, but I don't exactly have the fungibles for testing right now), so I’d love to connect with other neurodivergent individuals. I’m also progressive, so if you lean further right than left of (U.S.) center, we probably won’t be a good match.

🏡 Right now, I’m working on law school applications and looking for temporary work until I can (hopefully!) move out of Florida. Although, the job market here is kind of barren at the moment. My dream destinations? Oregon, Washington, Northern California, the Northeast, or maybe even the UK or Spain.

🐶 I’m an indoor cat with three dogs, introverted but always up for deep, silly, or philosophical conversations. I’d love to know if you have a strong opinion on something completely insignificant (like, is cream cheese superior to butter on toast, and are you willing to fight to the death to defend that absurd opinion?).

💬 I have basic proficiency in Spanish and would love to improve. I understand much more than I can actually speak, so if anyone is interested in chatting over the phone to help me practice, I’d be up for that!

💜 I’m a cisgender woman, minromantic, and demisexual and have no dating or relationship experience. I'd like to make friends with people who can commiserate. I’d like to connect with people close in age, preferably within five years of my own (so 25 to 35), but I won’t protest if you skew a bit older.

📬 I’d like to start with email or chat and move to letters once we build a solid rapport and I feel safe enough to hand out my physical address. An international pen pal could be fun too!

If any of this resonates with you, send me a message. I’d love to hear about your world, your passions, or just your favorite way to drink coffee! 😊",3,1740561909.0,penpalsover30,0,1.0,False

She was very friendly about it, but said she was kind of busy and didn't ask for another time, so from that point on I tried to move on and ofcourse I was still friendly, but didn't show much interest anymore (she was pretty shy, so I always tried to initiate a conversation if it didn't feel 'forced').
This is actually quite sometime ago...

Now last week she's been showing some clear signs of interest, even getting a bit flirty. My friends even overheard her talking about me. However, I just don't feel the excitement I had before like when you're happy to see them in class. There was no rush of excitement when my friends told me, more a simple, 'Oh, only if she'd just told me so 2months ago). I still think she is really pretty, sweet and smart, but I just think I got kind of tired of her mixed signals. I don't really feel my heart beating faster when I talk with her and I don't see her as just a classmate, but I don't know to what extent I see her as more than that. 

I just wonder, if she asks me to hangout sometime, is it wrong to say yes, do I give her false hope. Should I show interest in her and just see where it goes. I just don't know if I still like her or just the thought of what could have been, bc I also don't want to hurt her feelings, knowing it didn't feel the same...",1,1740561748.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Meron akong tao na di sya Philippine based. Bale bagong hire lang sya nung January. Mula nun di pa sya nakakumpleto ng isang buong linggo. Nung una walang internet, may kaibigang namatay, masama pakiramdam.

Nagfile sya ng VL for 2 days last week. Kahit bago sya inapprove ko naman. 2 days bago VL nya nagSL sya for 2 days din, tapos nung araw na balik nya dapat sa work after ng VL, wala. 45mins after ng start of day minessage ko at tinanong kung nasan sya. Sabi nya wala daw kuryente at tubig sakanila. Ako naman nainis kasi bakit di ka man lang nagsabi. Kailangan pa ako yung magreach out sayo. Bale Sunday to.

Monday nagmessage sya na wala parin daw kuryente at tubig, may action plan daw ba ako na makapagmake up sya sa ibang araw (wala kaming ganun sa company). Sabi ko unpaid na yung SL nya tsaka yung absent nya ng Sunday at Monday dahil 2 palang accrued leaves nya. Sabi nya 48hrs daw. At this point 3 days na daw sya walang kuryente dahil nagstart ito Saturday.

Tuesday buong araw wala syang message, 9pm start ng work namin dahil EST kami. 7pm nagmessage ako sakanya kung ano na update, sumagot sya ng 8pm na wala parin daw kuryente/tubig.

Bale ganito:
2 days SL
2 days VL
2 rest days
3 days absent (as of tuesday)

Since Monday in touch na ako sa HR namin na ganito yung nangayari. Clear naman si HR na kung anong action plan ko is supported nila.

So Tuesday mid-day nagdecide narin kami ng manager ko na ilet go sya, ito yung reasons ko:
1. Unreliable, 4 weeks na since nagjoin laging may absent
2. Wala syang sinabing plano nyang gawin ngayong wala syang kuryente, kumbaga di sya nageffort na magwork sa co-working space or sa coffee shop, or sa bahay ng kaibigan. 
3. Wala ring malinaw na clarity kung kelan sya babalik at magkakakuryente
4. Sa totoo lang may attitude issue to. Minsan na ko nireport sa HR kasi sinigawan ko daw sya at gusto na nya magresign, when in fact never itong nangyari at umamin naman sya na kaya sya ganun is may period daw sya so emotional. 

After ng termination email sumagot sya na bakit daw nagdecide ng termination na walang notification or discussion sakanya, willing daw syang lumipat ng bahay, actually sa contract nya, pwede sya magresign or iterminate without providing notice period. Yung tungkol sa paglipat, since Sunday ni minsan wala syang nabanggit, so ako at this point parang grasping at straws nalang sya sa tingin ko.

Gets ko na baka nagulat sya kasi wala talagang inkling sa mga message ko na baka matanggal sya ganun, tapos nagcomment din kasi si HR nung nalaman na may sinabi naman pala sya na willing sya magmake up nung days, parang impression ni HR is akala nila wala talagang paki. Parang kung pagkakapresent ko daw ng facts is as if walang care or paki si employee to make up. Ako kasi ang impression ko, offer na labas sa ilong yun, kasi kung totoong willing ka, edi sana nakahanap ka na ng paraan diba, 3 working days na ang nagdadaan. Tsaka yun nga wala naman kaming facility sa “make up” days at wala naman kami sa school

Justified ba ako sa pagtanggal sakanya?

Not that it matters pero di rin naman maganda performance nya.

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

I assume an appropriate approach is a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined as \`gestalts´.",1,1740561711.0,Neoplatonism,0,1.0,False

The world of e-commerce is more accessible than ever, but success requires more than just listing products and hoping for sales. Whether you're launching an Etsy shop, a Shopify store, or selling on Amazon, understanding key strategies can help you stand out, attract customers, and build a sustainable business.  

## 1. Find Your Niche  
Selling online is highly competitive, so a clear niche helps you target the right audience. Instead of selling ""home decor,"" focus on a unique angle, such as **""handmade eco-friendly wooden wall art""** or **""minimalist digital art for modern spaces.""**  

### How to Find a Profitable Niche:  
- Research trending and evergreen product categories.  
- Use platforms like **Etsy, Pinterest, and Google Trends** for insights.  
- Consider your skills and passions (e.g., if you love crochet, create seasonal plushies).  
- Validate demand by checking competitors and their customer reviews.  

## 2. Create High-Quality Listings  
Your product listings are your online storefront. A well-crafted listing can make the difference between a sale and a pass.  

### Key Elements of a Winning Listing:  
- **📸 Stunning Photos**: Use natural lighting, multiple angles, and lifestyle shots.  
- **📌 Compelling Titles**: Include relevant keywords (e.g., _“Handmade Ceramic Coffee Mug – Minimalist Stoneware Cup, Gift for Coffee Lovers”_).  
- **📖 Detailed Descriptions**: Highlight materials, size, benefits, and unique selling points.  
- **🔍 SEO Optimization**: Use relevant keywords in titles, descriptions, and tags.  

## 3. Master Marketing & Social Media  
Driving traffic to your store requires more than just good products. Build an audience and engage potential buyers through:  

- **Instagram & Pinterest**: Share behind-the-scenes content, styling ideas, and customer testimonials.  
- **TikTok & Threads**: Short-form videos showcasing your process can go viral.  
- **Email Marketing**: Offer a discount for signing up to a newsletter and keep customers updated on new arrivals.  
- **Etsy & Marketplace Ads**: If you have the budget, test small ad campaigns to boost visibility.  

## 4. Offer Exceptional Customer Service  
Customer satisfaction leads to positive reviews, repeat purchases, and word-of-mouth marketing.  

- **Fast Response Times**: Answer inquiries within 24 hours.  
- **Clear Policies**: Provide clear shipping, return, and exchange policies.  
- **Personalized Touches**: A handwritten thank-you note or eco-friendly packaging can make your brand memorable.  

## 5. Optimize for Seasonal & Evergreen Sales  
- Plan ahead for holidays (**Christmas, Halloween, Mother’s Day**).  
- Use seasonal trends to create limited-time offers.  
- Balance trending products with evergreen items that sell year-round.  

## 6. Analyze & Improve  
Track your store’s performance using built-in analytics (**Etsy Stats, Google Analytics, Shopify Reports**). Identify:  
- Best-selling products  
- Keywords that drive traffic  
- Conversion rates and pricing strategies  

## Final Thoughts  
Online selling is a mix of creativity, marketing, and strategy. By refining your niche, improving listings, leveraging social media, and providing great service, you’ll set yourself up for long-term success. Start small, experiment, and always look for ways to improve.

I am posting this because my child recently turned 18 and I don't know if I should tell her why I don't want her talking to her aunty my sister.
So for context I 35yof had my daughter at 17, my sister is 10y older than myself. 
When I was pregnant with my daughter it wasn't the easiest of pregnancies, I had constant vomiting all day everyday whole pregnancy high blood pressure and other complications, when she was born she weighed all of 2.2kg, had poor blood sugar and couldn't maintain her weight, even though she was far from premature. At that time the heal prick tests didn't test for cystic fibrosis, she was born November testing in uk arrived the following April. (This is important for context).
As my daughter was getting older she had a hard time with gaining weight and her chest always had rattling thick mucus, her nappies would have the strangest looking poops with white lumpy gel mottled through it I would go to the gp speak to my health visitor at one point I straight up asked for her to be tested for cystic fibrosis, at which point they said as there was no history on either side of the family it was unlikely and simply didn't test, fast forward to when my daughter was 10 months old, my sister called and asked to take my daughter for a walk and coffee and cuddles alone as my sister Nicola had given up her house to move in with her bf and was feeling so sad, I the dumbass desperate for a little break I was also pregnant with my son at this point, allowed her to take my child. 
She had made a gp appointment in my daughter name took her into the dr and told them I had munchausen by proxy, I am attention seeking and lots of other rubbish.
A few days later my daughter chest got really bad booked her into gp was told it was common cold after hardly even looking at my sick baby.
A little while after this was my nieces christening Imogen my daughter had a bad day with coughing vomiting etc at which point I was talking to other family members and expressing my concern that I think she had a lot more wrong than a cold and asthma at which point Nicola a few drinks down stumbled over and shouted at me that I have munchausen by proxy and my daughter should be taken
This went on until my daughter was 21 months old at which point she had mrsa in the lungs and was hospitalised, diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and thank the drs nurses who broke the news waited until Nicola was present to share the diagnosis.
Since that moment she has tried back tracking attempting to gaslight and said she never did or said any such thing. I have it in writing in my daughters medical notes she said that to the dr, not to mention her drunken outburst at the christened 
Fast forward my daughter obviously still has cf has had little to nothing to do with Nicola as on the rare occasions I have tried to forgive she tries to make me feel stupid, unworthy, paranoid, and generally like a piece of shit.
She also likes to make out that my kids are as shitty as she has it in her head that I am 
The reason I can't forgive is because simply she had never admitted what she has done, this I know makes life rough for my 5 other siblings all of whom I love so so much and miss so so much I never attend family things as I don't want to tell anyone she can't be there but I can't be around her she makes me so sad and angry! It's also for my 72yo mom who my favourite person I love her like crazy, her 70th birthday we all did her a big party which both myself and sister attended but my kids didn't as I don't want her near them
I don't know why I am sure I'm doing the right thing but still think I could be an asshole ",1,1740561592.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

I assume an appropriate approach is a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined as \`gestalts´.",1,1740561571.0,thinkatives,0,1.0,False

I've never mastered the art of the tidy.

[Cat](https://preview.redd.it/5eg8t73eagle1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=a940e625bc5febffeb770b0b219c56021379f9f5)

Things accumulate. Most of the time, I don't know where they've come from - but detritus gathers around me like leaves around a deciduous tree. Here is a straw, for which I have no explanation. Here is a plastic cup with a picture of a mouse on it, which I am fairly sure I have never seen before.

My wife is fairly convinced I'm some kind of magical filth-weasel who can conjure shambolic confusion out of the ether with a careless flick of my wrist.

I am partially convinced that there is a mess-fairy, who fly-tips and steals my loose coins. She turns up with a small sack full of land-fill and scatters it haphazardly, rummages through my desk-draws, and scarpers before people wake up in the morning.

Of course, I also have a young child - who probably has much the same effect. I also have two orange cats and a little black puppy, all of whom seem to be composed entirely of fur, and an unquenchable urge to make sure that nothing is left on top of anything else.

The house is never really all that messy. We're not hoarders with a life-time supply of newspapers and broken toaster-ovens stacked to the ceiling... but when you've lived in a place for a few years you do tend to accumulate more things than you have shelves to put them on. I'm a sucker for gadgets, and my wife will fill any available flat surface with houseplants... so there's not much room for anything else.

It's not just the accumulation of copious amounts of chaotic salmagundi (I can certainly throw stuff in a sack and hurl it into the appropriate bin) so much as the fact that I am particularly bad at seeing the aggregation of life's disposable rubble.

That may sound odd, but I swear it's a genuine phenomenon. This, I suspect, reinforces my wife's filth-weasel epithet. I can feel all smug about having tidied a room, and it takes other people to point out the dead badger on the table that I somehow managed to completely miss.

He will usually have next to him an empty energy-drink can, and an old newspaper.... and three books (Terry Pratchett and Alistair Reynolds at the moment), a piece of paper I'd been sketching on... maybe some paperclips, a coffee cup, two paint-brushes in a shot-glass full of methylated spirits, and - for some reason - a miniature rubber duck.

... a cheap plastic happy-meal toy, a piece of string, an old photograph of a turtle, two pokémon cards, and an ancient set of Dungeons and Dragons dice that my kid dredged out of a cupboard somewhere.

With a fairly disenchanted ""Oh"", I will carry on from where I - apparently - left off.

I normally have quite a good attention to detail. Oh, there will be mistakes in my half-coherent rants, where I used the wrong 'too', or used the word ""fiduciary"" three times in the same sentence - or, draws instead of drawers, for those who comment without reading the whole article... but I'm generally pretty good at spotting the little things.

So it confuses me that clutter seems to gravitate towards my blind spot like a determined pair of orange cats towards a precariously balanced glass of extremely expensive single-malt Glenmorangie.

I have to wonder if there's anything else I'm missing. People talk about an elephant in the room... would I actually see one, or would I have to wait for my wife to come home and point at it?

After months of coding, testing and tweaking, I finally launched our SaaS on Product Hunt today! It’s been a rollercoaster of late nights, bug fixes, and coffee-fueled sprints, but I made it.

This whole journey has been a massive learning experience and a few things really stood out:

- Marketing is just as hard as coding – Writing APIs was the easy part. Getting the word out is another challenge altogether.

- Early feedback is priceless – The few beta testers I had pointed out things I never would’ve noticed on my own.

- Launch day anxiety is real – You think you’re ready, but something always comes up last minute.

For anyone who’s launched their own project, how did it go? Any lessons learned or things you’d do differently?

I think I need to rebuild my Proxmox environment and need your help as I'm not quite sure what the best way to do it is.

I installed Proxmox on a MiniPC some time ago and first installed an LXC container with Nextcloud.

root@pve:~# pct config 100
arch: amd64
cores: 4
features: nesting=1
hostname: NextCloud
memory: 4096
mp0: dataext:vm-100-disk-0,mp=/dataext,backup=1,size=1980G
mp1: MovieDrive:vm-100-disk-0,mp=/mnt/movies,size=4970G
net0: name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,firewall=1,hwaddr=82:11:8B:1B:80:91,ip=dhcp,ip6=dhcp,type=veth
onboot: 1
ostype: ubuntu
rootfs: local-lvm:vm-100-disk-0,size=64G
startup: order=1
swap: 4096
unprivileged: 1

On dataext:vm-100-disk-0 (lvm-thin on SATA SSD) are primarily pictures, on Moviedrive:vm-100-disk-0 (lvm-thin on USB HDD) accordingly movies.


Some time later I set up a second LXC container with Photoprism:

root@pve:~# pct config 101
arch: amd64
cores: 2
features: nesting=1
hostname: PhotoPrism
memory: 4096
mp0: dataext:vm-100-disk-0,mp=/dataext,size=1980G
net0: name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,firewall=1,hwaddr=86:CB:A8:50:D8:B4,ip=dhcp,ip6=dhcp,type=veth
onboot: 1
ostype: ubuntu
rootfs: local-lvm:vm-101-disk-0,size=32G
startup: order=2
swap: 4096
unprivileged: 1

Since I wanted to access images from Nextcloud with Photoprism, I searched for how to do this and eventually just tried mounting the CT volume of the Nextcloud container in the same way as in the Nextcloud container, and lo and behold - it works (until today) without any problems.


Therefore, I did the same thing with the movie drive when I later set up an LXC with Jellyfin:

I've now been working on installing Proxmox Backup Server on another mini PC that I want to place at my parents' house. This should tunnel into my home network via Wireguard (Wireguard server on my FritzBox) and provide off-site backups.
In the process, I stumbled again upon how bind mounts actually work and that the way I'm using CT volumes in multiple containers is probably rather risky.


But: How do I clean this up now?
If I completely remove the data from the CT volumes and put it on an EXT4 drive, mount this on the PVE host and then make the bind mount, the data won't be backed up via the Backup Server.
Should I change the Nextcloud LXC to Privileged via backup and restore, then set up an NFS share, mount it on the PVE host, and then bring it into the other two containers via bind mount?
This raises the question of how I can write the container itself and the data from dataext and Moviedrive, which are included in the backup, back to separate drives? During restore, I can only select one volume.


Could you please give me a push in the right direction? I'm pretty lost right now and going in circles.",1,1740560933.0,Proxmox,0,1.0,False

Open for comments of any sort. For context, I confronted my wife about her toxic behavior and things spiraled out of control. 1.5 months ago, she was put in a psyche ward for suicide attempt. At least she claims she had a suicide attempt, but she told me after I said I wanted a divorce, so it feels like manipulation.

She's now transferred to a place where she's allowed more freedom, she can have the kids visiting, and she can get leave to visit the home. She visited the home on Saturday, and spent the evening alone with the kids. After she left, I was looking forward to relaxing, but she had other ideas. 

We started arguing about divorce again. She wanted to meet the bank to transfer the house to me, and I told her to stop. We need to talk to lawyers first, and that she needed to talk to a therapist before she gifted me over $100k. She continued, and I told her to stop and be rational, but she hates to listen to me and does the opposite. 

She transfers all her money to me, tell me to find a new partner and deletes me from social media. I contact her by text message and say that this is symptoms of immediate threat of suicide. She refused to deny or address my concern. The department where she's at now does not have phone reception in the weekends, so I was forced to spend Saturday evening and Sunday talking with people to see how immediate of a threat it was and what to do.

Come Monday, and I repeated to her something I've told her so many times. This type of behavior is really hurtful behavior, and when you hurt the feelings of someone you love, you apologize. She refused. She had already said that she was sorry for her behavior many times, she said. So it seems since she's said she is sorry for previous wrongs, she's got a get out of jail free card for life.

One of the things that rejuvenate me, and one of my favorite things to do with my alone time, is to bring a notebook to a café, have a coffee and just watch people and think and reflect. She knows this very very well.

Yesterday we had this correspondence, and it's in a different language, so I'll write it out instead of screenshotting.

>Her: Can I have the kids over this afternoon? You can go to Starbucks and have some alone time

>Me: Of course, we'll have a quick dinner and come right over.

>Her: You are welcome to stay too, but I thought Starbucks was more appealing. 

>Me: All though the kids would like to hang out as a family again, I need some time after this weekend. Besides, I need to go to the mall to get some supplies that are starting to get urgent.

>Her: When I write an invitation like that, it's an invitation for reconciliation, but I understand you're tired of me.

It's just so damn tiring. She takes the thing that I love and weaponize it against me. She's always going on and on about how she offers me alone time, and that I always decline. Then, when I accept, I get a verbal punch in the face.

I write to her and tell her how this makes me feel, and that it is really hurtful. And I don't understand why she can't allow me 1-hour break after 1.5 months alone with the kids. And as usual, no apology. Just more drama.

Come today, and she pretends like nothing ever happened. She offered to take the kids again tomorrow. Yet another shit test I've got to deal with. And around and around we go. She's not moving back in with us, but we still need a relationship because of the kids. 10 more years of this. Once she's out I of the psyche ward, I will start to gradually withdraw.",0,1740560810.0,abusiverelationships,1,0.5,False

So there’s this girl in my bio class (both of us hs seniors) and blah blah she’s quite pretty and I’m thinking about approaching her, she’s new at my school this semester—I’m 99.9% sure she’s not taken but I’m also fairly sure and suspect I’ve received some strong looks in my direction.

My plan was to approach her if I see her around campus and bring up that we have bio and stuff together and just tell her I think she’s cute and that I wanted to ask her for her number/snap—which I don’t feel is too much? Is there a different way I should do this?

I feel the need to (afterwards?) say something along the lines of like-if not, that’s totally fine and I don’t want to make things awkward for the rest of the semester (we don’t talk otherwise more like she doesn’t talk which I get bc she’s new and our school’s overwhelming as hell but the point is I don’t think either one of us can even be negatively affected by this) and I guess somehow suggest that I “need friends” in that class or at least don’t really know anyone—chat is this a good plan? (Plz don’t roast 😭)

I’m open to suggestions but I know this isn’t really “asking a girl out” which is why afterwards I was thinking of texting her after waiting a sec and stuff? Not too much but an appropriate amount where I can just say a few things and then maybe if I see her again at school and have another more face-to-face conversation before I ask if ‘she’d want to hang out’ or ‘go get food or coffee’ sometime after school?

I don’t want to ask her out over text because to me that feels rushed, also I want her to be more familiar with me because we like don’t know each other.

My goal is to nail this first conversation with a friendly vibe so that she feels comfortable with me off the bat, and then pursue her with more direct action after?

A question/concern I have is that I’m leaving this  Thursday for a college visit and I’ll be gone the whole weekend, but that’s also the day I was for some reason planning on asking for her # (idrk why it just seems like the right day to bc we have bio that morning & our class schedule rotates all the time)
—But then the problem with that is that I won’t be at school on Friday or anything and I don’t wanna make her wait or make her ancy if she is interested, or idk if I should like just do it on thurs anyway and then just text her a couple times over the weekend, and see her the following week? OR if I should wait until next week to do any of this at all. Any suggestions? Open to absolutely anything—the how or the when",1,1740560420.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Feeling alienated from girlfriend of 6 years,"Hey friends, so I’m having a lot of conflicting and worrying feelings rn. Me and my girlfriend of 6 happy years, we’ve talked about definitely getting married at some point, we’ve living together for 3 years previously, the whole 9 yards etc etc. We’ve recently been long distance (about 4 hour drive if you can call it that) as she is studying a Master’s in a different city, and in the meantime to save money while she’s in student accom, I’ve been staying at my parents, whilst also studying (all distance learning online). 

So 4/5 I have been the one making the effort to come to her to visit. Which I get, she is at a brick university, I’m online and can study anywhere, however I do have full time shift work I have to dance around, and again, she’s set 9-5 hours and works Saturdays, so I get it.

To cut to the chase, this morning she was up early for uni (around 7) I don’t have any immediate thing to get up for so I naturally stayed in bed for a few minutes on my phone. After coming around, about 7:15 I go into the kitchen. She’s made her breakfast, coffee etc. and first thing she says to me without prompt is “btw you’ll have to make your own coffee I don’t have time”. Bear in mind, it’s in a cafetière, so it would literally just be an extra scoop and water all in the same jug. No time at all. And her uni isn’t til 9 and a 20 minute walk.
I’m quite low maintenance/not one to ask for things that I could do myself, so I’d never outright say “please can you make me a coffee” or make a fuss. But this moment for some reason jarred me and I’ll try to explain why.
To put this in context, when we lived together/when she is able to visit me, my gf likes to sleep in on her days off. I’m talking til like minimum 10, latest mid day. Which fair enough, she needs more sleep sometimes, just how her body works. The thing is, I always make the effort to cook her a portion if I’m making breakfast (eggs, porridge etc). I also make the effort to do a barista style coffee with all the bells and whistles, swirled, latte art, cream, sprinkles, syrup etc etc. 
When she said “I don’t have time to do you a coffee”, I thought maybe she thought that I was still asleep. But she couldn’t have, because I spoke to her as she got out of bed and was in the bathroom.

This is all to say, my mind is racing over this small selfish gesture, that I will always make the effort for her, and she won’t return the same for me. And it hurt. Am I overreacting?

In the evening, I felt my dopamine levels drop. this is when my impulse control tends to weaken. In the past, this would be the moment I gave in to cravings, either by eating something carb-heavy or, at one point, drinking alcohol. But last night, I resisted. Even though my body felt like it needed something, I ignored it completely and went to bed.

This morning, I overslept, woke up miserable, and felt unusually groggy. Something keto normally prevents for me. I only started feeling better after having some salt and a slice of cheese. Honestly, this was one of the first times I didn’t cave to a low-dopamine state in the evening, but the morning consequences were rough. More than just feeling bad, I’m concerned about the potential impact on my dopamine regulation.

I’m not on keto for weight loss. I do it for stability and peace of mind. Overall, it’s been great, but these challenges need solutions.

Any tips?

I grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania—the kind where everyone knows each other, kids play outside until dusk, and the worst crime was someone not mowing their lawn. It was quiet, peaceful, predictable. And even though everyone said it was ""the perfect place to live,"" I always felt that something was... off.

I can’t remember when I first heard about the man under the streetlight. Maybe it was on Halloween, when kids tried to scare each other, or maybe someone told me the story around a campfire. But everyone in town knew it.

For decades, every night after midnight, a tall, thin man supposedly stood at the corner of Oak Street and Miller Avenue. He never moved. He never spoke. The streetlight above cast a glow, yet his face was always hidden in shadow. The older folks said he had been there forever.

Some claimed that if you walked up to him, he would vanish into thin air—but if you ignored him, he would stand there all night, completely motionless. Others swore they had seen his face, but no one could explain exactly what was wrong with it.

When I was twelve, I was walking home from the movies with my brother. It was late, quiet, with only a few streetlights breaking the darkness. As we turned the corner, my brother grabbed my arm and whispered:

— Do you see him?

I looked up. And there he was. A tall figure, wearing a long coat, his face swallowed by shadows.

I took a step toward him, but my brother yanked me back.

— Don’t go near him. Just keep walking.

I didn’t argue. We picked up the pace, but I kept glancing over my shoulder. The man remained there, still as a statue.

I never asked my brother why he was so afraid. But from that night on, I avoided that corner.


---

Fifteen years later, I returned to my hometown. I had been living in New York, but I had to come back—my father had fallen ill and needed care. I hadn’t been here in years, and it didn’t take long to remember why.

Everything looked the same. The same houses, the same streets, the same scent in the morning air. But something felt wrong.

On my first night back, I couldn’t sleep. An uneasy feeling kept my eyes open. After an hour of tossing and turning, I decided to go for a walk.

I wandered familiar streets, passing darkened windows and parked cars whose owners were fast asleep. It was quiet, except for the distant sound of a barking dog.

And then I realized where I was.

I was standing at the corner of Oak and Miller.

I looked up at the streetlight.

Someone was standing beneath it.

My heart pounded.

It was him. The same tall silhouette. The same long coat. Standing motionless, exactly as he had when I was a child.

Every instinct told me to run. To scream. To get as far away as possible. But something stopped me.

I couldn’t move.

I willed myself to take a step, but my legs felt like concrete.

I stared at him, and he stared at me. Or at least, I think he did. I couldn’t see his eyes. His face was still shrouded in darkness.

I tried to speak.

— Hey... are you okay?

Nothing.

I wanted to step closer, but then... something changed.

He didn’t move. He didn’t make a sound. But I felt it.

His face… shifted.

I don’t know how to describe it.

Like it wasn’t a face at all. Like it was just a shadow, pulsing, stretching, morphing.

And then I understood.

This wasn’t a man.

My heart pounded, my breath quickened.

And suddenly, I could move again.

I turned and ran. I didn’t look back.


---

The next day, I couldn’t shake the feeling of unease. I convinced myself I had imagined it, that it was exhaustion playing tricks on me. But I knew I had to find out the truth.

I went to the town library and started digging through old newspapers.

After hours of searching, I found the first mention.

1934: A young man, Richard Evans, was found dead under the streetlight at the corner of Oak and Miller. The police did not release details about the condition of the body, but witnesses claim it was… strangely deformed.

My pulse quickened.

1952: A group of teenagers claimed they saw a man under the streetlight. When one of them approached, he disappeared.

1978: A young woman went missing at night. She was last seen near Oak and Miller.

There were more articles. Each one connected to people who had either seen him—or vanished near him.

He had been there for decades. Maybe longer.

I couldn’t breathe.

I shut the newspaper and ran out of the library.


---

Instead of going home, I went to my grandmother’s house. She was one of the town’s oldest residents, knew every story, every rumor. If anyone could tell me the truth, it was her.

I knocked on the door. After a moment, I heard slow footsteps, then the creak of hinges.

— Jack? — She frowned. — What are you doing here at this hour?

— I need to talk to you.

She let me in and led me to the kitchen. The familiar scent of coffee and lavender filled the air. I hesitated, then finally asked:

— Grandma… what do you know about the man under the streetlight?

She froze.

Her expression hardened, lips pressing into a thin line.

— Why are you asking?

I told her everything. That I had seen him as a child. That I had seen him again last night. That I had found the articles.

She was silent for a long moment, as if choosing her words carefully. Finally, she spoke, her voice low:

— Did you see his face?

— No. But… I think it was changing.

She took a deep breath.

— Listen to me, Jack. That thing is not human. It never was.

— Then what is it?

— No one knows. But one thing is certain—when you notice it, it starts to notice you.

A chill ran down my spine.

— What does that mean?

— People who see him start having nightmares. They feel watched. Some of them… disappear.

— But the whole town knows about him.

— Because everyone has learned to ignore him. It’s the only way.

I clenched my fists.

— But that doesn’t make sense! If he’s hurting people, why hasn’t anyone done anything? Why hasn’t the police—

Grandma gave me a sad smile.

— And what would they do, Jack? Give him a ticket for loitering? Arrest a shadow?

I had no answer.

— You need to leave town, Jack. And forget you ever saw him.


---

That night, I couldn’t sleep.

Every rustle made me jump. Every shadow seemed longer, more unnatural. I felt like someone was standing outside my window.

At 3 a.m., I heard knocking at the door.

I froze.

It was soft. Steady. Three knocks.

I didn’t move.

Another three knocks.

Slowly, I walked to the door and peered through the peephole.

No one was there.

But when I looked outside, I saw the streetlight across from my house flicker on.

And under it, someone was standing.

Tall. Motionless.

Facing directly at me.

Then I knew.

Grandma was right.

It had noticed me.

And now, it was waiting.

I couldn’t look away.

The man under the streetlight stood there, motionless, but I could feel his gaze, even though I couldn’t see his eyes. I didn’t know how much time had passed—seconds, minutes? My heart pounded in my chest, and my breath was shallow and uneven.

And then, slowly, very slowly, his head tilted to the side.

It wasn’t a normal tilt. It was too smooth, unnatural. As if his neck had no bones. As if his body wasn’t made of the same thing as mine.

I stepped back from the door as if it had burned me.

“Don’t pay attention to him.”

Grandma always said that was the only way.

But how was I supposed to do that when he had already seen me?


---

I didn’t sleep until morning. I sat by the window, watching the streetlight.

At four in the morning, the figure vanished. It just… melted into the darkness.

I don’t know what I expected. Maybe that it would all turn out to be a dream? A hallucination? But when I looked at the door, I saw something that made it hard to swallow.

On the wooden surface, right next to the handle, there was a handprint. As if someone had pressed a damp hand against it.

Only, it wasn’t a normal handprint.

It had five fingers, but they were too long, too thin. As if they belonged to someone… who shouldn’t have them.


---

The next day, I decided to visit my grandma. I had to know more.

As soon as I crossed the threshold of her house, she looked at me and paled.

“He found you.”

I didn’t answer, but she must have seen it in my eyes.

She led me to the living room and shut all the curtains.

“Jack… you need to leave. Today.”

“Grandma, tell me the truth. What is this?”

She looked at me seriously.

“I don’t know. But I do know that once he notices you, he doesn’t stop.”

“I don’t understand.”

Grandma sighed and got up from the couch.

“Come.”

She led me to a room at the end of the hallway, the one I had never liked. It was old, smelled of dust and lavender, and yellowed pictures of ancestors hung on the walls.

She opened an old wooden cabinet and pulled out a small, worn box.

“This belonged to my father,” she said quietly.

I opened the box and found a few yellowed papers and a black-and-white photograph.

The photo showed a group of people standing in front of a building. They were all serious, looking directly at the camera.

But in the background, under a streetlight, there was a motionless figure.

Tall. Thin. Face hidden in shadow.

I shivered.

“This is from 1928,” Grandma said. “My father claimed he saw him for the first time then.”

I looked at her, feeling a chill run down my spine.

“For the first time?”

Grandma nodded.

“After that night, he started having nightmares. He said he felt watched. And then…” she paused for a moment. “One night, he just walked out of the house. And never came back.”

I clenched my fingers around the photo.

“And you think the same thing will happen to me?”

Grandma didn’t answer for a long time.

“No, if you leave,” she finally said. “You have to, Jack. If you stay, he’ll get closer.”

I didn’t want to believe it was true. But I knew I had no choice.

I had to run.


---

That evening, I started packing my suitcase.

I didn’t care where I was going. The only thing that mattered was leaving this place as soon as possible.

But then I heard something that made me freeze.

A knock.

Three knocks.

Slowly, I turned my head toward the door.

The knocking came again.

I didn’t step closer, but I knew.

He was there.

Waiting.


---

I didn’t open the door.

I sat on the bed, waiting for the knocking to stop.

And finally, it did.

But then I heard something worse.

A scraping sound.

Like someone slowly dragging their hand across the wood.

I felt it—if I so much as glanced through the peephole, it would all be over.

So I didn’t look.

I sat there until morning.


---

The next day, I got into my car and drove forward, never looking back.

As I left town, I felt the tension slowly leave my body.

Maybe Grandma was right. Maybe all I had to do was leave, and he would let me go.

Everything seemed calmer.

But as I merged onto the highway, something caught my attention.

On the right side, a few dozen meters from the road, stood a lone streetlight.

And under it… someone was there.

A man in a long coat.

I froze.

No. That’s impossible.

I drove past.

Don’t turn around.

Don’t look.

But in the rearview mirror, I saw the man under the streetlight slowly turn his head.

He was looking at me.

And that’s when I understood.

You can’t run from him.

You can only ignore him.

But he will always be there, somewhere in the background.

Waiting.

Since then I have started supplementing with 1200mg of Sodium (I just mix 1/4th teaspoon of salt in water with lemon, I take a mix in the morning and evening) and 375mg of Potassium and Magnesium (I got this at the Pharmacy).

Yesterday I had a very stressful day at work (actually I have had a stressful week so far), and I had been experiencing some Symptoms already during the week. After work, we went for dinner with a group of people I was not very familiar with, and the amount of stimuli was too much, by the end of the evening I had so much tension in by back, I could barely stretch.  
And no surprise, today I woke up with a migraine. I took my Potassium and magnesium mix and went back to bed for 30 min to no effect. Then I took my Sodium mix, and a cup of coffee and went back to bed in the dark for 45 min. I woke up and the pain was gone. I still feel weak, but the pain usually lasts 3 to 4 days,  taking painkillers. And today it was over in 45 min after taking some Sodium.

1iyj5rz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceZA/comments/1iyj5rz/looking_to_fix_my_finances_after_a_career_change/,Looking to fix my finances after a career change,"Hi everyone! I’m 24, living in Cape Town and trying to rectify my financial situation after a career change. This is a bit long but I’m hoping for some advice:

I used to net about R25K, living with a partner who nets R22K (but we mostly keep finances separate aside from rent and utilities). I’m now netting R20K, so lost a fifth of my income. I don’t regret anything: i hated that previous job and the one I have now is the one I’ve always wanted and the start of the career i studied for in the first place. Just need to reorient my finances. 

I have about R15K in credit card debt, mostly accumulated due to the income change (so I couldn’t pay it off fully like I used to). I know I need to tackle this but am left with barely enough money monthly to make slightly above minimum payments. I will admit some reckless spending from me as well: I was really excited for this new job and bought new clothes and such. But I’ve stopped all use of my clothing account since. 

I have a car that costs a total 7K (instalment, insurance and petrol). Bought the car since I used to be able to afford it (before I knew how terrible the job was) and couldn’t get to work without it. I’m happy to sell but don’t have any extra cash to offset the settlement if I can’t sell for the settlement cost (about R270K). I’ve included the car details below if anyone’s interested on advising more on this. 

Currently spending:
- R7K on rent and utilities (we have a separate hot water system that makes this harder to keep stable though)
- R2K on groceries (tried getting this down but the prices keep rising🥲)
- R2K on a phone, gym (these are important to me since my health is a bit shaky and my previous phone conked out. I’m planning to keep the phone for longer than the contract length though, probably 4 years like the last one)

What I’ve done so far: 
-  I tried getting the phone amount down (have a migration fee that’s going to wipe out my leftover money this month but it’ll pay itself off in 3 months). 
- Cut out going out with friends, unnecessary trips to keep petrol cost down + low cost/affordable gifts only (less than R300 and only for closest friends)
- Taking lunch to work instead of buying it, same goes for coffee and takeaways. We went from weekly to maybe once in a month. 
- I am postponing some medical things (glasses don’t work well anymore lol) but I have a plan for this. Everything else is covered my medical aid. 

Challenges: 
- On rent, can’t really go lower without keeping my car (which I think I should definitely sell since I can’t afford it) since I need to be close to work or the buses. 
- Still not enough money to make a real dent in the credit card bills, which I’d like to pay off fully in the next year. 

Car details:
- 2020 Ford EcoSport with full franchise service history
- Still has 2 years extended service plan and warranty, tyres are fairly new (one set is 1 year old, other set is 6 months old)
- Also has some extras: I have anti smash and grab tint; a tow bar and spare wheel cover, spare tyre (no rim but can add if someone wants it, not sure a buyer would be open to it though)
- Two scratches (a small one above a rear wheel and another on the bumper. the rear one is a bit deeper but not very visible unless you’re inspecting closely)
- I do need to replace the brakes and one of the brake lights but, again, don’t have the loose cash at the moment. Not sure how open a buyer would be to me repairing them on condition of a sale so I can put the money I would’ve spent on the instalment cost on the repairs. I’m not looking to profit, literally just sell. 

I tried selling to dealers but they were coming in about R60-100K lower than my settlement cost so I couldn’t do it. I’m hesitant to take out a loan to get out of another loan since I know that’s not the best idea and the interest rates on a personal loan would be really high. Also considering AutoTrader at the moment so any advice on how to sell privately and safely would be appreciated. 

Also both brand new to this career and role so a raise is out of the question rn🥲💔 I used to have a second income stream (tutoring) but that’s also out of the question since I’m also studying this year (partly to justify a raise next year lol).

Any advice on this would be appreciated. My partner has been really supportive but I want to get the finances under control for my own peace of mind and so I can save money for myself and (hopefully) a deposit on a car I can actually afford. 

I’ve gotten myself into a bit of a mess here since I inflated my lifestyle too much when I was earning way above my experience level and I’m aware of the fact so please be kind. I’m already beating myself up about it. What I want to dedicate myself to is fixing it and making sure I don’t do this to myself again. ",6,1740559635.0,PersonalFinanceZA,12,0.88,False

But in the afternoon she got busy/little stressed and she got cold with me (I felt that it was off) even when I asked her a work question so I just put my headphones in for the rest of the day (wanted to concentrate anyway).

When it got to the end of the day I just double checked everyone was good for the day and said “I’m heading off”. As soon as I said it I started walking out and she went “oh! Bye” with a little pout in a semi disappointed or somber tone. I stopped walking, looked back and said “what?” Not in a blunt way but with a bit of a small smile and she “nothing” with a small smile.

Kind of like she was expecting something before I left? Or maybe I’m reading into it too much.

Found this confusing because her and another coworker were going somewhere after work, so we were never going to walk out together tonight.

Then the next morning (WFH day) she sent a:

“hi, are you busy” message

Usually every would have stuff to do right in the morning and the conversation didn’t really go anywhere so I felt like she was reaching out for a reason.

OLD POST:

Did my coworker really want me to stay the night?

I (25F) work with this woman (25F), and while we started off as just colleagues, things have gotten a lot more friendly and there’s this playful energy between us.

For context, I’m more Tom-boy presenting, and she’s more fem—not that it matters, but I feel like it signals that I’m queer.

At first, our conversations were strictly about work, but over time, we started hanging out more. She lets me borrow her hoodie at work when I’m cold (I’ve offered her mine before), pouts at me when she’s hungry or wants coffee, we’ve shared drink and food before (like bite over my bite etc.) and always wants my opinion on clothes she’s thinking of buying. When I suggest something, she seems genuinely interested. And in the past, she’s even looked disappointed when I put my headphones in, knowing it meant we wouldn’t be able to chat as much.

Then, there was the day we went to a festival. We both ended up there from work, I lost my friends, my phone died, and my ride home disappeared. I ended up being the fourth wheel, but she shrugged it off, saying that without me, she would’ve been third-wheeling anyway.

At the end of the night, she invited me to her place to charge my phone. She made me tea, gave me a hoodie to wear, and we sat on her bed while she took off her makeup. She shared a personal, funny story—something that wouldn’t come up at work. Then she casually mentioned I could stay over. I hesitated, unsure of what she meant by it. She kept saying, “It’s up to you,” and eventually, I decided to go home, mostly to avoid any awkwardness in the morning. If I had stayed, we would’ve been in her bed, and I think I would’ve left feeling even more confused.

I’ve shared a bed with friends before, and normally, it wouldn’t be a big deal. But this felt different—maybe because of our dynamic, or the fact that this was my first time at her place. We aren’t exactly close friends or even outside-of-work friends yet, which makes me wonder…

You don’t just casually suggest something like that unless you’re extremely comfortable—or at least a little curious, right?",1,1740559139.0,OffMyChestPH,0,1.0,False

Jill finds herself yet again in the pitfalls of pity, so as an attempt to cheer herself up, she collects her daughters and goes to Duncan's for some coffee. While there, she feels compelled to post.

The problem with this post, which I'll spell out in a moment, isn't limited to this post. If we look at the one directly ahead of it, we find Jill recording the family on one of their church visits, and as she often does, she includes recordings of the sermons at these events. Part of the preacher's discussion is about legalism. The act of taking scripture and twisting it up to make a checklist of man made rules that don't serve Him. They serve self, and allow folks to display the superiority those rules create. The rules don't advance the Gospel. They don't secure your spot in heaven. They're man made, and they're an impediment to a true relationship with Jesus Christ.

So back to Duncan Donuts. Jill remarks on how proud she is of her girls for their skirts and dresses, and their long hair. How it's such a display of their love of the Lord. She even goes so far as to slam other young Christian ladies for not looking and dressing as she and her family do. She can't get out of her own way long enough to see the Biblical error in her thinking. 

On Valentine's Day, Jill says she lead a young woman to Christ. Did she make sure to tell this person that she must grow her hair and give up pants and shorts, or did she simply direct her on how to receive His salvation?

The problem with this family isn't their faith in Him. It's the faith they have placed in their man-made rules,  derived from twisted misinterpretations of Scripture. It's more important to impose these rules on themselves so that they can superiorly claim that other Christians are in the wrong for not living and looking like they do!!",7,1740558905.0,RodriguesFamilySnark,3,0.9,False

I once helped him with a minimal task and he gave me flowers the next day as a thank you… Whenever I leave the office and turn around to say bye to everyone, 9 times out of 10 I catch him staring at my butt. When he gets up to the coffee machine, he just watches me work me and looks away when I catch him. When I get up to open the window, or talk to another co-worker he watches me, like he finds whatever I do fascinating. When I say watch I mean watch, not just a quick glance, he will watch until I catch him looking and then look away. When I go to the bathroom, and this has never happened with anyone but him, he coincidentally gets up right when I get back so we end up bumping into each other and then he laughs nervously and apologizes. When I have a question, he comes way too close to me and my computer and puts his arm around my chair. I once moved my chair away so his arm fell and he laughed and apologized.

I don’t know how else to describe it but he just seems hyper aware of me and he gets nervous and tongue tied when talking to me, which makes me feel creeped out because he’s 30 years older than me.

I always mention my boyfriend on purpose around him but it doesn’t seem to change anything. I just don’t know if I’m overreacting because he hasn’t done or said anything explicitly inappropriate. He’s a kind guy and best friends with everyone including my boss so I just don’t know who to talk to, I would feel much more comfortable if I could work in another office because I want him to stop being able to look at me… He’s the reason I don’t work overtime because I don’t want to be alone in the office with him.

1iyiz3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1iyiz3a/i_26f_think_i_need_to_break_up_with_my_boyfriend/,I (26F) think I need to break up with my boyfriend (28M) before he proposes,"All of my friend are his friends, so I don’t have anyone to talk this out with and I don’t trust that it won’t get back to him before I’m ready to have the conversation. So I guess I’ll spill all my feelings to strangers on the internet. 

I woke up one day last week and realized that if I marry my boyfriend, I will be miserable. He didn’t do anything different, but that’s kind of the problem and I think I finally just thought through what our relationship is like. 

We’re practically roommates at this point. There’s no intimacy at all, basically our whole relationship has been me initiating physical intimacy. Once we start going, he doesn’t even make sure I’ve finished. He’ll sometimes try to get me off by ways other then penetration but he just kind of gives up after a few minutes because he’s tired. I can get myself off and he is well aware of that, but there’s only so much a vibrator can make up for you know. We’ve talked about it before and he says he just doesn’t want to have sex as much now that he is older, which is totally valid and I never pressure him into doing things he doesn’t want to do. It just gets frustrating that we go months without even touching and he’s totally fine with that. Not just sexually, any physical contact besides a kiss goodbye when we leave for work. 

He doesn’t even say he loves me unless I say it first. This has been a point of contention before, but his rebuttal to it is that he shows he loves me in other ways like bringing me coffee in bed every morning. I’ve told him this bothers me but he doesn’t even say he’ll try, he just says that’s how he is. I understand that his love language is different than mine, but he doesn’t put any effort in the meet me halfway. 

Everyone has been asking when we’re getting engaged. He’s been saying that he wanted to wait for the 5 year mark before getting engaged, but we’re 5 months past it and now he shuts the idea of an engagement down because he says we can’t afford a wedding. He knows that I want to get engaged, that I want that next level of commitment. We don’t have to get married right away. People stay engaged for years before actually having a wedding, I don’t even want anything big. I’ve considered proposing to him instead, but I really need it to come from him. I need just a little bit of effort to show that he actually cares about me and my feelings. 

So, last week I woke up and realized that getting married will not change who he is and how he acts. I saw the signs earlier in our relationship but I thought he would at least try to meet me halfway, but he never will. I love him and up until last week I was 100% wanting to spend the rest of my life with him. Now I don’t know what to do. It feels like the only reason he still keeps me around is to pay for half our household bills. I know I need to talk with him about all of this, but I have a bad feeling that will be the end, and I’m not ready to face that yet. I know I need to do it soon though because we have a trip to Hawaii with his coworkers scheduled in May, and if he finally gets it together to propose while we’re there, I don’t think I can say yes. 

Any thoughts or advice on the situation would be helpful. Right now I just have all these thoughts swirling around in my head and no one to talk to about them. How do I proceed?",0,1740558772.0,relationship_advice,3,0.33,False

""Well, how long is that then, Brandy? do you mean long as in you guys just had one long passionate night together? or is it long as in the length of your hit list of men who you've spread your legs to over the years? which one is it?""
I asked Brandy who looked at me wide-eyed like she couldn't believe I'd say something so vile and vulgar towards her.
""It's only been a few months, Elena, that's all""
—
Elena's P.O.V.
""Elena baby, wh..what...what are you doing here?""
""I was in the neighbourhood, I thought I'd stop by for a chat""
I say sarcastically.
""Ellie baby, this...""
Tristan said as he pointed his finger between himself and Brandy.
""This isn't what it looks like""
Tristan says and I roll my eyes.
""Why do cheating bastards like you always say it's not what it looks like when they've been caught in the act?""
I ask with irritation in my voice.
""You're undressed and she's undressed, you're a dirty, disgusting, sweaty mess and Brandy...well, she's always been a dirty, disgusting, sweaty mess from the moment puberty smacked her in the t**s like a freight train""
I say and Brandy gasps while Tristan looks at me with a horrified and angry expression on his face.
""Not to mention, her hair looks like a rats nest, you've got scratch marks on your chest, back and hip, oh and the most obvious one is that your d**k is currently wet and saluting the troops after braving the deep, dark trenches between my sister's legs...what the f**k else could it look like, Tristan? were you both playing a game of Twister?""
I ask with irritation and frustration in my voice.
""Baby, I swear, it's not...""
Tristan once again tried to plead his case but was cut off by a very frustrated and angry Brandy.
""Ignore him, Elena, it's exactly what it looks like, we were having s*x right here in your marital bed""
Jesus Christ.
Someone should call the media and let them know that we've got a modern-day Albert Einstein on our hands.
I thought to myself whilst rubbing my forehead in frustration.
""Thanks for that, Brandy, I'm not sure I would've ever gotten the truth out of him without you here pointing out the obvious to me""
""You're welcome""
Brandy says with a smile as she pulls a face at Tristan who looks at her like what the f**k? and I don't blame him for feeling this way, to be honest with you.
This b***h wouldn't know what sarcasm is unless it came shaped like a d**k and smacked her in the face.
""Ellie love, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for this to happen, it was a mistake""
""A mistake?""
I ask incredulously.
""A mistake is when you put salt on your cornflakes or in your morning coffee instead of sugar, Tristan, not when you repeatedly stick your c**k inside of your sister in laws p***y""
""But this was a mistake, babe, I promise you...why don't I go and get dressed, so that we can go downstairs and talk, hmm?""
Translation, let's go downstairs so that I can manipulate you and make you believe my lies so that you won't try to leave me again.
""I'm just gonna go and...""
""How long?""
I cut Tristan off and he looks at me confused.
""What?""
""You heard me, Tristan""
I say while glaring at him.
""How long have you two been screwing each other behind my back?""
""N..not that long, Ellie""
Brandy says nervously as she shares a nervous look with Tristan.
""Well, how long is that then, Brandy? do you mean long as in you guys just had one long passionate night together? or is it long as in the length of your hit list of men who you've spread your legs to over the years? which one is it?""
I asked Brandy who looked at me wide-eyed like she couldn't believe I'd say something so vile and vulgar towards her.
""It's only been a few months, Elena, that's all""
Tristan said and I scoffed while rolling my eyes as Brandy's shocked expression quickly changed to a nasty glare as she sneered at my husband before looking back at me with an innocent butter wouldn't melt look on her face but her eyes gave away her true feelings and she was feeling very happy, proud and smug right now.
""He's lying to you, Elena, we've been having an affair for over two years now, in fact, we just celebrated our anniversary last month""
Wow.
""Brandy...""
Tristan said through gritted teeth but was cut off by my sister who feigned being frustrated and angry with him before softening her gaze and tone at me.
""No Tristan, she deserves to know the truth""
""You're right Brandy, I do, so tell me...when did your affair start?""
I asked them and I was confused when I saw Tristan's face pale as Brandy pretended to gulp.
I also wanted to know why they did this but knowing why my husband decided to step out on our marriage and break our vows seemed irrelevant and insignificant when Brandy said what she said next.
""After you found out your son was stillborn and you were forced to give birth to him while he was dead, you know the same day where you also found out that your chances of conceiving a child again were slim to none""
Brandy said her carefully crafted answer making sure to use the precise evil words to hit me right where it hurts but it only hurt me slightly before I felt myself growing numb to everything because I knew what she was telling me was the truth.
The reason why I know this is because the anniversary of my son's death was last month the same month as their quote-on-quote anniversary.
I've come to terms with the fact my husband is a lying, cheating scumbag and I've certainly come to terms with my sister being a nasty, attention-seeking w***e but the one thing I'll never ever be able to come to terms with is my infertility, especially when someone who isn't even worthy of scraping the dog nonsense off the bottom of my shoe is using it to low blow me because she's an evil, vindictive b***h.
Just when I thought my sister couldn't sink any lower than she already has, the b***h then went on to say something which not only tore my heart into millions of little pieces but it also made me doubt my faith in God as well.
""It's probably a good thing that I'm currently pregnant so that the Lockwood name can continue on with this baby, isn't that right, my love?""
Brandy said with a smile as she reached for a shocked Tristan's hand.
It never ceases to amaze me how God will give people like Brandy the gift of fertility knowing full well she doesn't have a maternal bone in her body and only sees her baby as a meal ticket to money and a luxurious lifestyle while women like me, you know women who would love nothing more than to be a mom and have kids are left infertile, it's not fair.
I briefly closed my eyes and let out a slow, shaky breath to control my emotions and stop myself from crying before opening them again and looking directly at Tristan as I said five words to him which caused an array of different emotions to cross his face.
""I want a divorce, Tristan""
I said nonchalantly and he looked at me with a shocked expression before it changed to a look of pure, unadulterated rage.
""WHAT?""
He growled.
They say when you die, your entire life flashes before your eyes which is said to be a strange phenomenon known as a life review showing you everything you've experienced in life from the moment you were born to the moment you took your last breath but what does it mean if you experience this phenomenon and you live to tell the tale?.
After I had announced to Tristan and Brandy that I wanted a divorce, I left the room and headed downstairs to call my brother who I was hoping could help me find somewhere temporary to live until after my divorce is finalised but before I could even get my phone out of my pocket, I was viciously pushed to the ground by my husband who then straddled me and beat me black and blue until I eventually passed out.
I didn't come too until around twenty minutes ago and I was feeling so much pain but strangely enough, it was all physical pain, none of it was emotional or mental pain, I guess that's because I had already checked out of my marriage in that way a long time ago meaning there's nothing Tristan can do that could hurt me any more.
When I married my husband at the young and tender age of eighteen, I like many other people on the planet believed that we'd be together forever and that nothing could break us apart.
I thought our marriage could stand the test of time and that divorce was just a forbidden word that one never spoke of or thought about, kind of like the three monkeys hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil, well, it was like that.
I thought every single day of our marriage from the day we said I do to the day we would say our final goodbye and move on to the next life together would feel exactly like it did during the early days of our relationship which was filled with so much love, passion and lust.
I thought we'd do everything we could to make each other smile and feel happy but obviously, I was wrong because now, not even seven months after Tristan and I had celebrated our seventh wedding anniversary, I was here in our bedroom which was still a f*****g mess thanks to the two lovebirds and I was packing my bags with determination in my heart to leave this place for good and divorce my husband as soon as possible.
Without context, most people would think we were just going through the seven-year itch and that I should think long and hard before I make any rash decisions that are permanent because I may or may not end up regretting it but that's not the case.
I guess you could say that I've had rose-tinted glasses on for the entirety of my relationship, from the moment I first met my husband to when he asked me to be his girlfriend when we were just teenagers in high school, right up to the very moment I had received that text message from my friend which blinded me from seeing the real Tristan.
Even though subconsciously I knew who he was and the type of man he was, I still refused to see the bad in him but now my eyes are clear and are wide open and any love I had for him or that I thought I had for him is long freaking gone.
""Come on, come on, Brand, pick up the phone""
I mutter into the phone.
""s**t""
I groaned when the line went dead.
This prick has always got his phone glued to his hand and the one time I need his hip, he's MIA.
I've tried calling my brother umpteen times since I woke up from being unconscious but he's not answering me for whatever reason.
I once again tried to call Brandon as I continued to pack up all of my things and make sure that I've got everything that belonged to me because when I finally leave my former marital home, I plan on leaving it for good.
""Donovan here""
Oh, thank god, he answered me.
""Brand...Brand, it's me""
""Elena? Elena baby, is that you? what's wrong? is everything ok?""
Brandon asks sounding panicked which broke the wall in me causing me to break down.
""I..I need you, Brand, I can't do this anymore, I can't stay married to Tristan any longer, I..I'm done""
""Done? what do you mean you're done, Elena? what did he do? he hasn't hurt you again, has he?""
He asked angrily and I absentmindedly touched my lower lip which has been split open and bruised thanks to my delightful husband.
""Elena?...Elena sweetheart, talk to me, tell me what's going on?""
Brandon asked me and I sniffled.
I hated crying and I hated feeling weak and vulnerable because I've always been a strong woman but even the strongest of people are allowed to have a weak moment and this was mine.
""Can you just please come to my place and get me, Brand? I'm leaving Tristan and this time it's for good, I'm not gonna tolerate his abuse any more""
Brandon is the only one who knows about the abuse my husband has put me through these past seven years but he didn't find out about it because I wanted him to, no, it was because he had walked into my room unannounced while I was getting changed and he saw a massive bruise on my back, as well as several other bruises on my abdomen.
Tristan has always been very meticulous when it comes to hitting me because he knows I'm a strong girl who can easily defend herself against anyone, so he only makes sure to hit me when he knows I'm vulnerable and he always makes sure to hit me in areas which can't be seen and can easily be covered up.
In fact, today was the first time he lost control of himself and hit me square in the face, as well as attempting to choke me out leaving marks on my face and neck.
Brandon wasn't happy when he found out about the abuse, in fact, he was apoplectic and told me that he wanted to call in some of his army buddies to teach Tristan a lesson which I stupidly put a stop to but I wouldn't this time if he gave me this option.
""What do you mean, kid? what's he done?""
""I'm done, Brand, I'm so done""
I sobbed as I sat down on my bed and ran a hand through my hair as fresh tears filled my eyes and fell down my face.
""He cheated on me, Brand...he f*****g cheated on me and when I confronted him about it and told him that I wanted a divorce, he went crazy and attacked me""
""He what?""
Brandon growled causing me to flinch.
""You heard me, Brand""
I whimpered as my body shook with sobs.
""He's been cheating on me, he's been having an affair for two f*****g years of our marriage and you'll never guess who the skank is who he's been screwing behind my back with""
""Who is it? is it someone we know?""
Brandon asks me and I chuckle.
""Oh yeah, it's someone we know very well, Brandon...it's Brandy""
""What? Brandy?""",1,1740558509.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

[Enjoying the warm February morning at the beautiful Entebbe Botanical Gardens! It is such a perfect time to soak up the sun and nature during this dry season. 🌿☀️🔗 www.standardgorillasafaris.com ](https://preview.redd.it/gftl3qro1gle1.jpg?width=651&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=876765e75f8a76128acca7e6fec5b033dafc7d38)

# What country is warm in feb?

Uganda, the “Pearl of Africa,” sits right on the equator, giving it a tropical climate that is both unique and consistently warm year around. The equator’s influence makes the country experience two distinct seasons: the wet and the dry. However, despite the general consistency of Uganda's temperatures, the weather still varies slightly depending on altitude and[ geographic location](https://www.standardgorillasafaris.com/birding-safaris/#:~:text=Enjoy%20your%20Uganda%20safari%20by,Kidepo%20valley%20National%20Park%2C%20Mount). In the lowland areas, temperatures tend to be warmer, while the higher regions, like the mountains and plateaus, enjoy cooler conditions. 

While Uganda is known for its stable warmth, the slight fluctuations in atmospheric temperatures make the weather intriguing and delightful, [particularly for tourists ](https://www.standardgorillasafaris.com/uganda-safaris/14-days-exclusive-birding-safari-in-uganda/)who are looking for a comfortable and enriching experience throughout the year. One of the most notable weather patterns in Uganda is the seasonal rainfall, which typically comes in two main periods. The first rainy season usually begins in March and lasts until May, with the heaviest rainfall occurring in April. 

The second rainy season occurs from [September to November](https://www.standardgorillasafaris.com/blog/birding-in-budongo-forest/), with October often being the wettest month of the year. This regular pattern of rainfall supports the lush landscapes that Uganda is famous for, especially its [ever-green rainforests](https://www.standardgorillasafaris.com/blog/birding-in-mabamba-wetland-in-uganda/) and abundant wildlife. These periods of rainfall are essential for agriculture in the country, particularly for crops like bananas, tea, and coffee. During these months, the weather can feel cooler, especially in the higher altitude regions, but it's still far from chilly, maintaining Uganda’s tropical essence.

The dry season, which is one of the most anticipated times of the year, falls between December and February. This is when the country experiences the least rainfall and when temperatures can reach their peak, especially in the[ northern and eastern parts](https://www.standardgorillasafaris.com/blog/hiking-mountain-muhabura-in-uganda/) of Uganda. The dry season brings bright, clear skies, offering the perfect conditions for outdoor activities, including wildlife viewing and hiking. The hot temperatures during this season often make it more comfortable to explore the country’s national parks, as animals tend to gather around water sources, making sightings easier. 

This February, Uganda has experienced unusually warm weather conditions, making it a particularly good time to visit. The air feels dry, and the sun beats down with intensity during the day, making the evenings relatively cooler and pleasant. The warm temperatures combined with less rain create a unique opportunity for travelers to explore Uganda’s scenic wonders without worrying about the inconvenience of rain showers. February is typically one of the warmest months in Uganda, and this year, the dry season has lived up to expectations, offering excellent conditions for both adventure and relaxation.

The warm weather in Uganda during the dry season enhances the touristic experience in several ways. It’s the perfect time for wildlife e[nthusiasts to visit ](https://www.standardgorillasafaris.com/uganda-safaris/5-days-4-nights-beach-holiday-in-lake-victoria-ssese-islands/)Uganda’s iconic national parks, such as Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park or Queen Elizabeth National Park. These parks offer visitors the chance to witness the country’s world-famous wildlife, including the endangered mountain gorillas in Bwindi. With the warm weather, visitors can also enjoy a variety of outdoor activities like safari drives, boat cruises, and nature walks. 

In addition to the national parks, Uganda has a wide array of attractions that are best enjoyed during the warm, dry months. For example, tourists can visit Lake Victoria, one of the largest freshwater lakes in the world, where they can [engage in activities such as boat rides](https://www.standardgorillasafaris.com/blog/a-day-tour-around-entebbe/), fishing, or simply relaxing on the shores. The town of Entebbe, located on the shores of the lake, is an excellent destination, with its serene gardens and beautiful beaches. Entebbe is particularly warm during this time of year, offering perfect weather for a relaxing retreat by the lake.

For those seeking adventure, the warm weather makes it a fantastic time to hike the Rwenzori Mountains, often referred to as the ""Mountains of the Moon."" With clear skies and warm temperatures, the conditions are ideal for exploring the diverse landscapes that range from tropical rainforests to glaciers. Although these mountains can be challenging to hike, the dry season offers a more comfortable environment for trekkers. Additionally, the vibrant vegetation and wildlife in this region are at their most abundant during the warm months, making it a must-visit destination for nature lovers.

Another great destination for tourists during Uganda’s warm months is Murchison Falls National Park. The park is home to the mighty Murchison Falls. This offers breathtaking views, particularly during the dry season when the water levels are lower, and the falls roar with greater intensity. The warm weather also means better chances of spotting animals, as they congregate around the park's rivers and watering holes. The clear skies and sunny conditions make safari tours through the park more enjoyable, allowing tourists to fully appreciate the beauty of the surrounding landscapes.

""Will you let me take you out for coffee?

Damn, you are so beautiful, if you didn't have a boyfriend, I  would hug you right now. You are so pure.""

I blocked him but I am a bit afraid he is the type to hold grudges and has a past of domestic abuse and multiple DUIs and drugs and divorced. I don't like being alone in the same room with him for meetings. The whole pure thing is so creepy. He said I have the heart of an innocent little girl.

The first time I ignored his messages, I told him I was not interested he went on a rant and said, ""why am I not good enough for you because I don't have enough money for you or what because you are a little rich girl."" I said that him the last thing I look for and told him he better off financially than me and I was not rich.  I ignored his message and he sent me a dozen messages asking me for money and I ignored it. He used to me call me randomly at 6am and I would ignore the calls and then alarm me by texting it is an emergency. Then say never mind.

I told a girl and confided and she said, ""He is just in love with you and is obsessed with you. It is normal."" But he is not respecting my boundaries. in the past men who were that way stopped when I told them to stop.  I don't know what to do. He will not give up and I don't know if I should tell the person I am seeing but I don't want to get him involved and ruin what I have with this person.  But I feel uncomfortable and I am afraid.

I am afraid. nothing ever happened between us beside me being polite and kind to everyone. I never got his hopes up. I have't told anyone my sister, mom or dad about the last message he sent. I don't want to worry them. They knew about the rest and my mom was worried about me. Idk if I am over reacting but can he please just leave me alone and not hold a grudge or try to contact me again !!!!

You know, that magical moment where you’re knee-deep in work, and suddenly you realize three hours have passed, but it feels like minutes? That’s the elusive “flow state,” folks. 🌊 But let's be real—most days, getting there feels like trying to find a unicorn.

**So, how do we tap into this mystical superpower when we're surrounded by distractions?** 🧙‍♂️

Here are a few tricks I've picked up, mixed with a bit of trial and error and, occasionally, sheer luck:

1. **Guard Your Time:** First things first, carve out some uninterrupted time blocks. *Easier said than done,* right? But try starting small—maybe a 25-minute Pomodoro session? It's surprising how much you can get done when interruptions are minimized. You'll thank yourself later.

2. **Create a Ritual:** Think of it like gearing up for battle. Whether it’s making a cup of coffee, listening to a particular song, or just doing a quick stretch, having a consistent routine signals your brain that it's *go-time*. 🏋️‍♂️ Trust me, soon enough, your brain will click into gear faster than you can say ""productivity.""

3. **Declutter that Desk:** I know, I know—*again with the cleaning?* But seriously, a tidy workspace translates to a clearer mind. Plus, who wants to wade through yesterday’s coffee cups just to get to today’s to-do list?

4. **Limit the Tech Temptations:** Yeah, I’m looking at you, phone. 📱 Maybe try stashing it in another room or use apps that block those digital time-sinks. It's not forever, just long enough to dive into deep work.

5. **Dive into a Single Task:** Our brains *really* aren’t made for multitasking. So pick one thing and give it all you got. You might just be amazed at how quickly you slip into the flow.

Ever considered how Sherlock Holmes must have nailed this with his “deep work”? 🔍 Sure, he was solving crimes and not tackling the inbox, but hey—everyone’s got their thing, right?

And here’s a little secret—don’t beat yourself up if you don’t hit the flow every time. Even a focused 20 minutes is a win. 🏆

So, what’s your secret sauce for hitting the flow state? Or maybe your epic fails? C’mon, don’t leave me talking to myself here. 😉",1,1740558307.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1iyitzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1iyitzx/how_to_build_a_selfcare_toolkit_that_works_for_you/,How to Build a Self-Care Toolkit That Works for You,"**Ever feel like you’re running on empty but have no idea how to fill your own tank?** 🤔 Yeah, we’ve all been there. Self-care isn’t just bubble baths and face masks (though, honestly, who doesn’t love a good mask?). It’s about building a self-care toolkit that’s as unique as you are. Let’s unpack this together!

So, what exactly is a *self-care toolkit*? Imagine it like a personal cheat sheet for those days where you feel more scrambled than eggs at brunch. It’s all the little things that help you recharge and feel like YOU again. Let’s dive into how you can build one that works just for *you*.

1. **Identify What Makes Your Heart Sing** 🎶  
Is it sipping on that morning coffee while watching the sunrise? Or maybe it’s a 10-minute jam session to your favorite tunes. Whatever it is, make a list. These are your personal joy triggers, and knowing them is half the battle.

2. **Keep It Simple, Silly!**  
Your toolkit doesn't need to look like Mary Poppins’ bag. Start small. Jot down 3-5 easy things you can do, even on those ""I’m-too-tired-to-function"" days. It’s all about making self-care realistic, not another daunting task on your to-do list.

3. **Mix & Match for Different Moods** 🌈  
Feeling overwhelmed? Maybe a brisk walk will clear your mind. Need some comfort? Snuggle up with a good book or your fur baby. The idea is to have various options depending on what your current mood craves. Think of it as your personal mood ring!

4. **Borrow Ideas, But Make Them Yours**  
Read about meditation? Fantastic! But does it really work for you, or are you more of a journaling person? Explore, adapt, and curate tips you come across, whether it's from friends, reviews, or Reddit threads (wink). Just make sure they fit *you* like a glove.

5. **Check-in with Yourself Regularly** 🔍  
Life changes, and so should your toolkit. What worked for you six months ago might be different now, and that’s perfectly okay. Set reminders to review what’s in your toolkit and add or subtract as life evolves. Think of it like updating your wardrobe with each new season.

Remember, your self-care toolkit is just that—*yours*. It's about being kind to yourself and knowing that it’s okay to prioritize your well-being. After all, how can you pour from an empty cup?

Take a moment this week to pull together your toolkit. You'll thank yourself the next time you're worn out and need that gentle reminder that, hey, you’ve got this. 🌟

So, what’s the first thing you're going to add to your toolkit? Feel like sharing or keeping it close to your chest like a secret recipe? Either way, you're taking a step that celebrates YOU, and that’s something worth cheering for.",1,1740558148.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

TLDR: We are both 25F and very chatty/friendly at work. We talk on a more personal level now.

Yesterday I thought I’d do a little experiment.

In the morning she was super chatty as usual for the most part.

But in the afternoon she got busy/little stressed and she got cold with me (I felt that it was off) even when I asked her a work question so I just put my headphones in for the rest of the day (wanted to concentrate anyway).

When it got to the end of the day I just double checked everyone was good for the day and said “I’m heading off”. As soon as I said it I started walking out and she went “oh! Bye” with a little pout in a semi disappointed or somber tone. I stopped walking, looked back and said “what?” Not in a blunt way but with a bit of a small smile and she “nothing” with a small smile.

Kind of like she was expecting something before I left? Or maybe I’m reading into it too much.

Found this confusing because her and another coworker were going somewhere after work, so we were never going to walk out together tonight.

Then the next morning (WFH day) she sent a:

“hi, are you busy” message

Usually every would have stuff to do right in the morning and the conversation didn’t really go anywhere so I felt like she was reaching out for a reason.

OLD POST:

Did my coworker really want me to stay the night?

I (25F) work with this woman (25F), and while we started off as just colleagues, things have gotten a lot more friendly and there’s this playful energy between us.

For context, I’m more Tom-boy presenting, and she’s more fem—not that it matters, but I feel like it signals that I’m queer.

At first, our conversations were strictly about work, but over time, we started hanging out more. She lets me borrow her hoodie at work when I’m cold (I’ve offered her mine before), pouts at me when she’s hungry or wants coffee, we’ve shared drink and food before (like bite over my bite etc.) and always wants my opinion on clothes she’s thinking of buying. When I suggest something, she seems genuinely interested. And in the past, she’s even looked disappointed when I put my headphones in, knowing it meant we wouldn’t be able to chat as much.

Then, there was the day we went to a festival. We both ended up there from work, I lost my friends, my phone died, and my ride home disappeared. I ended up being the fourth wheel, but she shrugged it off, saying that without me, she would’ve been third-wheeling anyway.

At the end of the night, she invited me to her place to charge my phone. She made me tea, gave me a hoodie to wear, and we sat on her bed while she took off her makeup. She shared a personal, funny story—something that wouldn’t come up at work. Then she casually mentioned I could stay over. I hesitated, unsure of what she meant by it. She kept saying, “It’s up to you,” and eventually, I decided to go home, mostly to avoid any awkwardness in the morning. If I had stayed, we would’ve been in her bed, and I think I would’ve left feeling even more confused.

I’ve shared a bed with friends before, and normally, it wouldn’t be a big deal. But this felt different—maybe because of our dynamic, or the fact that this was my first time at her place. We aren’t exactly close friends or even outside-of-work friends yet, which makes me wonder…

You don’t just casually suggest something like that unless you’re extremely comfortable—or at least a little curious, right?",1,1740557917.0,dating_advice,12,0.67,False

1iyiqjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iyiqjk/what_to_choose_in_2025_1800/,What to choose in 2025? [$1800],"Hello all! 👋

Me and the wife are currently looking for a home espresso machine. I’m a coffee nerd while she wants something practical and pretty. So I have a 1000 questions!

Use case: something that can make 2-4 cappuccinos in a somewhat efficient and reliable manner while allowing me to experiment with lighter roasts occasionally. Modifications and tweaking is not a game stopper. 

We have more or less locked in on Profitec as the brand, with Rocket, Lelit and Rancilio also being easily available in my country (Norway). In particular, we have been looking into the Pro 400 and Pro 300 - both very similarly priced. I have not been able to compare prices to the Move and Jump as they are currently not available from local distributors. 

Any advice on how to choose? Is the HX + E61 on the P400 a bonus or curse? Is the P300 too small to be practical when steaming? Will the temperature instability of the E61 be a problem, or is it really not a big deal. Are they both «enjoyable» to use from a tactile and workflow perspective? Should we hold out for the Move or downsize to a Go? And of course, is there a notable difference in the quality of espresso and milk?

Any tips, tricks and experiences very much welcome. ",1,1740557731.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1iyiq2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTechBuild/comments/1iyiq2y/amd_ryzen_9_9900x_review/,AMD Ryzen 9 9900X Review,"So, you want to know about the AMD Ryzen 9 9900X, eh? Think of it as that quirky kid in your class – not always the *fastest* in every race, but consistently *cool* under pressure.

# The Cast and Crew

**Authored by**: Michael Justin Allen Sexton (and now, yours truly!) **Premiere Date**: August 14, 2024 **Starring**: AMD Ryzen 9 9900X **Genre**: A thrilling mix of CPU competition and efficiency

# Initial Buzz

First off, this chip *doesn't* win any gold medals for raw processing speed, which is more than OK, it runs circles around the competition when things get hot and heavy, offering the kinda performance that'll let you get your work done without also heating your house and, also its energy-sipping ways save you at the cash register in real dollars and cents.

# Quick Hits

* **Price Point**: MSRP $499 but you may get it at $405.29.
* **Pros:**
   * 12 CPU cores of pure Zen 5 goodness
   * Outstanding efficiency
   * Runs crazy cool
   * Competitive Performance
* **Cons**:
   * Can put your wallet on a diet.

# Technical Deets

|Specs|Detail|
|:-|:-|
|Core Count|12|
|Thread Count|24|
|Base Clock|4.4 GHz|
|TDP|120W|

**To Buy AMD Ryzen 9 9900X -** [**Click Here**](https://amzn.to/41eiEJg)

# What sets it apart? (The good, the meh, and the 'huh?')

So, what's the deal with the 9900X? I would rate it as someone trying to stay on top of every performance chart but not wanting to give up quality and energy cost, not trying to impress everyone but more inclined to have your work done by balancing between your expense, time and energy savings.

# The Good

* **Efficiency is its love language**: This CPU sips power like a hummingbird. It's impressive, I'd say you won't have much to say after checking your bill!
* **It's one cool customer:** Runs quieter than my grandma. Heat? I think it said, ""*I don't know her*.""
* **Architecture Advantage**: Increased internal bandwidth that helps with better performance and its cores were built with 4-nanometer process makes efficiency awesome!

# The Meh

* **Pricey McPriceFace**: At around $500 this ain't pocket change. Shop smart!
* **Can't make coffee**. Some CPUs offer you breakfast but not this guy, I mean really? It's almost perfect.

# A little Something Special

* It’s Zen 5 architecture rocks with more L1 and L2 cache. What's not to like?
* AMD has increased max official DDR5 memory speed, supported from 5,200MHz to 5,600MHz

# What The Tests Say

Alright so what does this all mean to us, huh? How does it hold when thrown into the testing arena? Well lets see:

* **Matching Intel**: Some tests show i7-14700K as the rival but hey with current voltage and heat related issue to intel the crown should be gifted AMD with this.
* **Numbers Game**: I mean it does pretty well in these benchmarks over it's previous version.
* **But Gaming Though?** So for the new one with a slight improvement or an exact copy this one stands at number 3 in line but you don't play much so this stands fine!

# Heat Wave!

This thing stays really, I'm talking crazy calm during tasks. In other words? Even as performance stands up compared to the previous version, the power it consumes remains so minimal that this CPU really shines.

# What the OTHER reviews are showing

So, in a world full of reviews, you want some extra deets? Well, here it goes

* **Gamers Nexus Says**: Okay so in gaming the AMD Ryzen 9 9900X falls on its knee but hey still awesome! On tasks that include a lot of work this chip kicks!
* **They also stated some numbers as such:**
   * 7.8/10 rating overall
   * And 7/10 for gaming
   * 8/10 on tasks
   * Efficiency stands at 9/10
* Other Stuff We Found
* **They dig the efficiency and price changes**. These guys enjoy these.
* **Not great gaming scores**. I told you this isn't supposed to win any gaming awards.
   * As such it was recommended that the CPU can be better in the Zen 5 chip by pushing better speeds at 170W which they stand correct since pushing more clocks allows for so much better optimization.
   * And gaming tests will be better off with the 7800X3D which is just plain awesome (their words not mine!)
* **They didn't like power limits on the CPU**. Maybe AMD should had pumped a few watts. Or I dunno what about water cooling to keep that puppy working without a jiggle! I'd take it if this CPU had a $449 to make it a more easier bargain for me, not so much but who's looking for the best CPU and is not budget-friendly at this point.

# Final Verdict!

*For people who value savings at the end of the month after opening the electricity bill this guy's for you. Also productivity will be on the house! Also this is how it plays with other components*

# Can You Even Afford It

As I was saying with the electricity bill savings? Not gonna cut the line for the bank anytime soon buddy. *But there's better Zen 4 alternatives for now.* For consumers focused on a price conscious value and who are into performance I can surely recommend you other tests that can be much more productive.

# Detailed Analysis: Decoding the Ryzen 9 9900X

Alright, folks, let's peel back the layers of this onion and really get into what makes the Ryzen 9 9900X tick.

# Under the Hood: Zen 5 Architecture

The 9900X is built on AMD's Zen 5 microarchitecture, which promises various architectural enhancements, for you that may have to be something but just know it rocks. It doesn't mean so much for you but for these numbers is means a lot.

# Architecture Improvements to watch:

1. New Zen Cores: built on the 4nm N4P by TSMC
2. Each core now has double micro-ops
3. L1 and L2 cache has more space compared to the other chips and memory bandwidth it has is even bigger for those.
   * CPU Cooling: The DEEPCOOL Mystique 360 with water-cooling that packs a digital screen.
   * GPU is MSI's GeForce RTX 3090 just in case if these numbers make any change, also known for its tripple fans and outstanding design!
4. \*The mother of all motherboards MSI's MEG X670E ACE that is high-quality made with enthusiast components.The Test Setup, you need a little background:

# Detailed Performance Breakdown

These can be a little messy if you aren't familiar with these stuff BUT with the 9900x, you may love the performance! With more power for a lower cost the Ryzen 9 9900X may show a different approach since its 2024 and these guys mean buisness!

# General performance:

So, what we were mentioning above regarding the AES tests in decryption. Wow! Did this guy took out any competitor, there wasn't no match in the performance of its competition, the R9 9900X with power. The 9900X didn't took all but one of the tests.

# What's been said: ""Rendering Benchmarks are outstanding"".

Also a quick word about ""efficiency"", because AMD reduced its wattage the product shines because it doesn't give up on rendering and it gives better rendering at even lesser wattage which, simply, sounds amazing to a consumer.

The gaming well so far for many games it doesn't mean to give so much improvement so, nothing new, some tests where better and I cannot be more glad since ""numbers means nothing if I don't notice something for my own"".

For the guys on our list, this CPU with that performance may do great things just on the hands of these new upcoming games but with the old ones nothing will happen! It will mostly do well for the price, or just not pay attention.

In this test also Intel can only match them but that's to be seen as this CPU improves over time and intel fixes their own problem

# Gaming? I said I wouldn't be talking about that, my bad

I wouldn't just focus on it. You may as well as spend your money in better parts with a lower-tier system for that gaming purposes but, the numbers show this isn't as big problem it is right now, since performance it's a solid match. And so the tests will say! With better cooling. AMD shines well because it's gaming friendly (so far, not this guy since these have proven to be another animal). But is AMD known in that specific area, for its cooling solutions and small energy consumption this may improve things. We will wait then. If anything they may have proven that you should spend in other part, other things. Not necessarily CPU but more so towards graphic cards, or well ""games don't shine too much of the potential"". If those are the cases this proves what has been discussed at point.

# Efficiency, Thermals, and power (The science stuff)

You know for science, things can be hot or be... a good power saving machine!

*So, what are the thoughts over at the AMD's place, if this one isn't really about that... since that 30W can do quite a bit?! That said it's worth something as this card manages to keep its things up but nothing compared to the others. I mean efficiency wise. With low temperatures with its awesome cooling this CPU is able to retain a good heat balance with great consumption with ""acceptable"" performance and this doesn't mean nothing it shows a great solution.*

Since not all tests are accurate to some CPU/Motherboards this may have affected the scores. If this card can hold and you manage to get 80C with a water cooling 240, its is as good as the tests results show, just try to see how you can do it before the performance numbers but that doesn't mean this won't be just as the results were and the card shows to you, be cautious on this results. The best recommendation will always be 240 liquid cooling with a large air cooler, but again test for yourself and see what the CPU shows.

# The Value question (aka, should I buy this?)

At 500Dls. This chip doesn't make so much difference (yet) because it can be an improvement while we speak. But hey what can be said this CPU can work for some applications or be used in a few scenarios but if they ever come is it worth it? And what the tests show, what it can save. Are worth it? We still can't really say with our hand on the line that yes! This one is just so much of worth. Since that the old chips have gotten to be compared to the newest series. Just sayin.

We still lean our head by 3 degrees since those other Intel fixes that came over the way is a no (we can't measure with such degree such thing you know).

# Bottom Line (The TL;DR)

AMD's Ryzen 9 9900X is an interesting customer. With the 14700k, they still stand tall for these reasons, maybe those will apply.

1. Better power efficiency and lower temps
2. Same performance, even better in gaming
3. With old gen CPU that is ""worth as much"", but with the voltage issue that they carry. There will be no performance drops since most are going to solve that voltage supply, and those CPU may not have the intended wattage to compare. With a slight favor to the 9900 for it voltage and heat issues but we still want to confirm this as this micro test affects it to make a valid measurement of things and numbers.

# That you get this thing on your side! As easy! As clear!.

# Final Words From AMD vs GN conclusion

*So in the AMD and other reviews about this guy it leans to, they made the wrong choice not spending a full board into a heat capacity over some parts they saw.* And hey to end all reviews and stuff they all say these are pretty good parts (it doesn't means they aren't), so this is on how we'll have and we need to show it to make that stand clear with our tests.

# More Perspectives on the AMD Ryzen 9 9900X: A Roundup of Reviews

To give you a truly 360-degree view of the Ryzen 9 9900X, I've compiled insights from various sources, throwing my thoughts on top:

# 1. GamersNexus: The Pragmatic Approach

* **Key Takeaway:** GamersNexus (GN) takes a no-nonsense approach, really. They appreciate the chip's efficiency and potential for specific workloads but emphasize that it isn't a gaming champion.
* **GN likes and I second that:**
   * Price cut from $499 to $449 after people tested this machine as well.
   * Powering low-key.
   * Awesome speeds
* **I like how the team said: ""that 30-watt headroom to overclock or improve other parts it just doesn't add or work better since they are limited"", I can mostly agree that to a slight measure it is like that since it will save you from your pockets and make gaming performance or test mostly a waste if the parts doesn't add all together and it will do even more for a productivity/gaming tests.**
* *I* would be more into a 7800X3D for some performance but the way I'm looking at the ""market"" so that said for the other CPU the heat is something I mostly do care for"". For how ""numbers and those little test"" it also brings me to say, I will be doing awesome so so and nothing too crazy to take all value with just numbers (but it's worth noting that GN has also done so so many tests! To their team, bravo! And thank you).
* So then AMD could have done to this line up with their CPU so it can improve the board and it heat capacity.

# 2. AnandTech: The Tech Deep Dive

* **AnandTech take their thoughts for all the chips available with all the specs out there:** so this is what they meant (The Ryzen 9 9950X uses two CCDs for a total of 16 cores (32 threads) just numbers things).
* *Well also this line seems to make all this thing say ""that AMD may do thing as simple to keep things up"".* Since everything for there review does not make too big deal, since that they ""only put them"" with a different view compared to the Zen parts that were ""as high as AMD has in store. Just because of core stuff"".
* The best thing that ANAND does better is they have a better chart because some aren't clear so they may or may not do well with those tests you look at.
* *I may agree so, mostly in heat and that stuff, AMD could have used a ""cooler TDP to see other thing and make ""tests on"" if the cooler manages things all test* and see the difference compared to everything there is on numbers thing, if it would have made so much impact vs tests.

# General Consensus: The Balancing Act

All in all, most sources highlight the Ryzen 9 9900X as a competent CPU but not an outstanding one.

I'd say these chips had been on balance in the most charts. Like performance with little consumption they had to prove those tests numbers and with such an small performance, these show this had improved well if done in real tasks. It's good at the things they are good at like efficiency and temps all others not so much, which shows a test well done to it's limited parts.

There were ""not the extreme of all gaming"" to the point you needed something, they did prove those parts can work but don't over thing or those won't shine since ""cores and such a performance for AMD it's made to be a different market over a game since the new wave requires lots of graphic thing done, but what it won't win there is, you will be saving lots by a mile and there's not just a performance drop for what your working, vs the heat it will give that PC part. If any gaming is the one.""

# The AMD Ryzen 9 9900X in the Wild: Real-World Scenarios

So, we have seen the technical specifications and test results for the AMD Ryzen 9 9900X. But hey what's the big deal?. Let's explore some real-world applications where this CPU could either shine like a supernova or fall flat faster.

# 1. Content Creation (Video Editing, Graphic Design, etc.)

* **How it shines**: the high core count and multi-threaded performance on this chip for all tests and such, it has a good place among rendering, it would be better than more affordable since high price also shows a real-world use. You save more watts than a CPU can offer by still being at balance or better over others CPU ""what a price"".
* **The dark side:** I do have to say and those charts showed, the price tag is really a no. Maybe you can do better off somewhere for 50 more watts or at other line parts if it's in value those tests will be a waste so for a 100 and it would be great that this chip would had shined to compare performance, tests that are more for this task as mention before all the reviews said ""no"". What I can also say with a good note with high cores, comes lots, of threads to the point performance if you know your software well that ""1,470 dollars or whatever would shine"", or ""not need to push an inch to your performance since with those high ends does about nothing much from what you had"", what some say. I should do another review. With my parts to tell that story.

# 2. Scientific Computing and Simulations

* **With the new AMD that came up, their code simulations are something to see**. Since they didn't put so much of those test (or did this reviewer) most scientist did took well with their parts to see the real deal. And I haven't so... so they will have all the reason why to push, or not push that big wallet"".
* But a real talk is: those numbers that ""most people don't see"" can say a lot of how they can use what parts on computer should make it worthy. The time test does shows this, with better wattage in the scene. It says a thing or three.""
* **""For that matter is worth more high speed memories before numbers test this rig, if there's a lot to store.""**\*
* What can also not ""shine"" is power since other can be put in high end and this can make performance do such big a number where scientists knows this and has made those kind CPU with this test that is well shown. If that makes any sense.

# 3. Gaming and Entertainment

*I have seen (and read!) With what GN told about there and they showed so well with lots and lots' the part for gamers, which again these doesn't matter a real big wow. Still does ""It"", you just shouldn't bother with these kinds of thing. Because the gaming performance will only cost if well done.*

* What's also known from AMD is there small amount of energy consumption in small amount of power, better with what I have mentioned there or there. Is so so! Not this (lol). That's just AMD for gaming, at their top.
* What you can take is in numbers this did had to make this guy perform better is other to see where to do what. Maybe graphics card?

""Not really to rely but who can tell, at some situation there are test, maybe you know which one? That needs all things in charts to stand the best if done by some measure with some things. With this. Just you, test.""

*4. General productivity (Office Work, Web Browsing, Etc.) 5. Home Media Server or NAS (Network Attached Storage): 5. And if 4 is the right amount for your Home Office then the 9 will be more so than 1 for everything, but be aware that these CPU won't be tested!*

*Most productivity ""home"" servers do little more than test those test to see if it helps, with the wattage of a 7 out number is already a blessing not needing all sorts of gaming part.* With an 9k line I can't tell they aren't all that well balanced for server homes which a number of scientist and those that love them will have that knowledge, 7 might be. This needs lots of looking after.

# Putting It All Together: Is the Ryzen 9 9900X Right for You?

After running through lots and lots of the technical stuff I have here, that may help you so to choose what PC you should buy. Let's re do the test! And what CPU that you should make a great a performance to whatever parts I have mentioned and what reviews (or said!) All the good things:

# First You and PC (How and what is those two)

Think. How do you use (with the CPU being a key player)!?

What applications Game all the days? Do you do editing? Simulation, coding? The answer will tell you this, and will have to, need that extra watt.

Do need good number with that extra cash to then get: High performing but balanced and budget CPU?

Well let's look at pros again before choosing. The pros list! If that may answer if ""I should have this for my system"" this:

1. Core test
2. Power with it's all thing, what tests it gives and temps well handled with new 3rd or old high quality part what number will look!
3. Balance (if you are smart as you know this market may be just a real test for your knowledge).
4. With some (or less) amount with all cores it is good That says great PC!

If for real (again!) This list: Editing videos, simulations! Good with coding! That the software really shines like a game well ""played"", since, so, so much games don't take such good thing, and they do give what they were meant it's also fine

But don't use!: Do only Office 50 at day I don't wanna really game because too stress

# Next What Can It Not Do:

We can then try what can a really really pro will have so: More and that heat will matter ""And so with price"" tag. As they say. And you may see. This makes and gives me the all. And I'm smart to get, now. All test parts that go together well not to worry about small. Performance difference! You are well suited and can be fine. This guy says, ""it may be. Don't, do"". There's that X factor this guide (or test).

*Those parts really aren't best, no number ""can test"" this since they change to much, do remember.*

# But! Remember:

*That said to a point it may cost you more with this part.* As the most that have said and I to said (a number!). It wasn't top chart there are 3Ds which they mostly excel. And there more. Other. Parts, or, or thing Those test has numbers high chart in many case will may want thing done at a rate power in many parts. So there you have, not everything the machine works well, not all test have a real life but be wary it will say lots. Or it will mean lots. What said a review of GN if you have such. That will have more to prove, the same tests for what it does well."" This ""thing"". Now do that small test all there at said, may have that to do it can mean this review a not worth"". There will show lots of, can't know it may will never give with those other parts"".

That! So will ""know now where your PC should come from"". I tell for it to work good and if you have what said you must show to make this part and whatever ""machine PC' parts will may shine at such cost"".

*This isn't (a short story said a review). All this for all it has with number or other parts that will shine""*, they told... there. Is your history of all ""parts"". And ""why it so"". All number I will show. If that to say there

Will help that the new or the old help in value"" so I will also do well"", or what the AMD also say said to such with power this aint also a gaming for high high end parts, but to code ""more parts."" Those ""may also get"". Good with power and more you also I told. Can put so small numbers but will, in the end said in value"". This you so

What with this parts test a will and make sense of ""can mean so high chart"". ""to know with I told of number"" and small the best say in may may, do ""test now to prove that it has you. ""But you're high number.

So be now be good with what you show all 9 I may to a you"". Good that with this test with so all"" And parts number said be why I'm, or with chart to a can't numbers with number, in the new there well. ""Or more parts and I in know can't show if has or the so test!"" Good has it does or so 5 will

# Final Thoughts, a Good Bye

So, yeah that about to how ""that for I what a what"" The machine, good ""now but to to test may parts now well""! Remember. It may all. Well the to this and you may said has know show say it why the new I to has, will. So so so that with all chart so all new chart it well to it to but to be and this this all is that. Numbers has high chart. May the new know may.

A lot of good review points can be brought here but you show and has you parts ""can mean so high chart"". With this new parts test say all well said be

So at the end of it all you say all chart high may has new. Why the a number a best and say you

At the review so I that AMD Ryzen at for you to, not know! But AMD parts review by.
