Down at the Ford place in Clanton he was known as the last man in recent history to pay cash for a new pickup truck. Sixteen thousand cash, for a custom-built, four-wheel drive..........","**Chapter One**  
Billy Ray Cobb was the younger and smaller of the two rednecks. At twenty-three he was already a three-year veteran of the state penitentiary at Parchman. Possession, with intent to sell. He was a lean, tough little punk who had survived prison by somehow maintaining a ready supply of drugs that he sold and sometimes gave to the blacks and the guards for protection. In the year since his release he had continued to prosper, and his small-time narcotics business had elevated him to the position of one of the more affluent rednecks in Ford County. He was a businessman, with employees, obligations, deals, everything but taxes. Down at the Ford place in Clanton he was known as the last man in recent history to pay cash for a new pickup truck. Sixteen thousand cash, for a custom-built, four-wheel drive, canary yellow, luxury Ford pickup. The fancy chrome wheels and mudgrip racing tires had been received in a business deal. The rebel flag hanging across the rear window had been stolen by Cobb from a drunken fraternity boy at an Ole Miss football game. The pickup was Billy Ray's most prized possession. He sat on the tailgate drinking a beer, smoking a joint, watching his friend Willard take his turn with the black girl.  
  Willard was four years older and a dozen years slower. He was generally a harmless sort who had never been in serious trouble and had never been seriously employed. Maybe an occasional fight with a night in jail, but nothing that would distinguish him. He called himself a pulpwood cutter, but a bad back customarily kept him out of the woods. He had hurt his back working on an offshore rig somewhere in the Gulf, and the oil company paid him a nice settlement, which he lost when his ex-wife cleaned him out. His primary vocation was that of a part-time employee of Billy Ray Cobb, who didn't pay much but was liberal with his dope. For the first time in years Willard could always get his hands on something. And he always needed something. He'd been that way since he hurt his back.  
  
  She was ten, and small for her age. She lay on her elbows, which were stuck and bound together with yellow nylon rope. Her legs were spread grotesquely with the right foot tied tight to an oak sapling and the left to a rotting, leaning post of a long-neglected fence. The ski rope had cut into her ankles and the blood ran down her legs. Her face was bloody and swollen, with one eye bulging and closed and the other eye half open so she could see the other white man sitting on the truck. She did not look at the man on top of her. He was breathing hard and sweating and cursing. He was hurting her.  
  
  When he finished, he slapped her and laughed, and the other man laughed in return, then they laughed harder and rolled around the grass by the truck like two crazy men, screaming and laughing. She turned away from them and cried softly, careful to keep herself quiet. She had been slapped earlier for crying and screaming. They promised to kill her if she didn't keep quiet.  
  
  They grew tired of laughing and pulled themselves onto the tailgate, where Willard cleaned himself with the little nigger's shirt, which by now was soaked with blood and sweat. Cobb handed him a cold beer from the cooler and commented on the humidity. They watched her as she sobbed and made strange, quiet sounds, then became still. Cobb's beer was half empty, and it was not cold anymore. He threw it at the girl. It hit her in the stomach, splashing white foam, and it rolled off in the dirt near some other cans, all of which had originated from the same cooler. For two six-packs now they had thrown their half-empty cans at her and laughed. Willard had trouble with the target, but Cobb was fairly accurate. They were not ones to waste beer, but the heavier cans could be felt better and it was great fun to watch the foam shoot everywhere.  
  
  The warm beer mixed with the dark blood and ran down her face and neck into a puddle behind her head. She did not move.  
  
  Willard asked Cobb if he thought she was dead. Cobb opened another beer and explained that she was not dead because niggers generally could not be killed by kicking and beating and raping. It took much more, something like a knife or a gun or a rope to dispose of a nigger. Although he had never taken part in such a killing, he had lived with a bunch of niggers in prison and knew all about them. They were always killing each other, and they always used a weapon of some sort. Those who were just beaten and raped never died. Some of the whites were beaten and raped, and some of them died. But none of the niggers. Their heads were harder. Willard seemed satisfied.  
  
  Willard asked what he planned to do now that they were through with her. Cobb sucked on his joint, chased it with beer, and said he wasn't through. He bounced from the tailgate and staggered across the small clearing to where she was tied. He cursed her and screamed at her to wake up, then he poured cold beer in her face, laughing like a crazy man.  
  
  She watched him as he walked around the tree on her right side, and she stared at him as he stared between her legs. When he lowered his pants she turned to the left and closed her eyes. He was hurting her again.  
  
  She looked out through the woods and saw something -a man running wildly through the vines and underbrush. It was her daddy, yelling and pointing at her and coming desperately to save her. She cried out for him, and he disappeared. She fell asleep.  
  
  When she awoke one of the men was lying under the tailgate, the other under a tree. They were asleep. Her arms and legs were numb. The blood and beer and urine had mixed with the dirt underneath her to form a sticky paste that glued her small body to the ground and crackled when she moved and wiggled. Escape, she thought, but her mightiest efforts moved her only a few inches to the right. Her feet were tied so high her buttocks barely touched the ground. Her legs and arms were so deadened they refused to move.  
  
  She searched the woods for her daddy and quietly called his name. She waited, then slept again.  
  
  When she awoke the second time they were up and moving around. The tall one staggered to her with a small knife. He grabbed her left ankle and sawed furiously on the rope until it gave way. Then he freed the right leg, and she curled into a fetal position with her back to them.  
  
  Cobb strung a length of quarter-inch ski rope over a limb and tied a loop in one end with a slip knot. He grabbed her and put the noose around her head, then walked across the clearing with the other end of the rope and sat on the tailgate, where Willard was smoking a fresh joint and grinning at Cobb for what he was about to do. Cobb pulled the rope tight, then gave a vicious yank, bouncing the little nude body along the ground and stopping it directly under the limb. She gagged and coughed, so he kindly loosened the rope to spare her a few more minutes. He tied the rope to the bumper and opened another beer.  
  
  They sat on the tailgate drinking, smoking, and staring at her. They had been at the lake most of the day, where Cobb had a friend with a boat and some extra girls who were supposed to be easy but turned out to be untouchable. Cobb had been generous with his drugs and beer, but the girls did not reciprocate. Frustrated, they left the lake and were driving to no place in particular when they happened across the girl. She was walking along a gravel road with a sack of groceries when Willard nailed her in the back of the head with a beer can.  
  
  ""You gonna do it?"" asked Willard, his eyes red and glazed.  
  
  Cobb hesitated. ""Naw, I'll let you do it. It was your idea. ""  
  
  Willard took a drag on his joint, then spit and said, ""Wasn't my idea. You're the expert on killin' niggers. Do it. ""  
  
  Cobb untied the rope from the bumper and pulled it tight. It peeled bark from the limb and sprinkled fine bits of elm around the girl, who was watching them carefully now. She coughed.  
  
  Suddenly, she heard something-like a car with loud pipes. The two men turned quickly and looked down the dirt road to the highway in the distance. They cursed and scrambled around, one slamming the tailgate and the other running toward her. He tripped and landed near her. They cursed each other while they grabbed her, removed the rope from her neck, dragged her to the pickup and threw her  
over the tailgate into the bed of the truck. Cobb slapped her and threatened to kill her if she did not lie still and keep quiet. He said he would take her home if she stayed down and did as told; otherwise, they would kill her. They slammed the doors and sped onto the dirt road. She was going home. She passed out.  
  
  Cobb and Willard waved at the Firebird with the loud pipes as it passed them on the narrow dirt road. Willard checked the back to make sure the little nigger was lying down. Cobb turned onto the highway and raced away.  
  
  ""What now?"" Willard asked nervously.  
  
  ""Don't know,"" Cobb answered nervously. ""But we gotta do something fast before she gets blood all over my truck. Look at her back there, she's bleedin' all over the place. ""  
  
  Willard thought for a minute while he finished a beer. ""Let's throw her off a bridge,"" he said proudly.  
  
  ""Good idea. Damned good idea. "" Cobb slammed on the brakes. ""Gimme a beer,"" he ordered Willard, who stumbled out of the truck and fetched two beers from the back.  
  
  ""She's even got blood on the cooler,"" he reported as they raced off again.  
  
  Gwen Hailey sensed something horrible. Normally she would have sent one of the three boys to the store, but they were being punished by their father and had been sentenced to weed-pulling in the garden. Tonya had been to the store before by herself-it was only a mile away-and had proven reliable. But after two hours Gwen sent the boys to look for their little sister. They figured she was down at the Pounders' house playing with the many Pounders kids, or maybe she had ventured past the store to visit her best friend, Bessie Pierson.  
  
  Mr. Bates at the store said she had come and gone an hour earlier. Jarvis, the middle boy, found a sack of groceries beside the road.  
  
  Gwen called her husband at the paper mill, then loaded Carl Lee, Jr. , into the car and began driving the gravel roads around the store. They drove to a settlement of ancient shotgun houses on Graham Plantation to check with an aunt. They stopped at Broadway's store a mile from Bates Grocery and were told by a group of old black men that she had not been seen. They crisscrossed the gravel roads and dusty field roads for three square miles around their house.  
  
  Cobb could not find a bridge unoccupied by niggers with fishing poles. Every bridge they approached had four or five niggers hanging off the sides with large straw hats and cane poles, and under every bridge on the banks there would be another group sitting on buckets with the same straw hats and cane poles, motionless except for an occasional swat at a fly or a slap at a mosquito.  
  
  He was scared now. Willard had passed out and was of no help, and he was left alone to dispose of the girl in such a way that she could never tell. Willard snored as he frantically drove the gravel roads and county roads in search of a bridge or ramp on some river where he could stop and toss her without being seen by half a dozen niggers with straw hats. He looked in the mirror and saw her trying to stand. He slammed his brakes, and she crashed into the front of the bed, just under the window. Willard ricocheted off the dash into the floorboard, where he continued to snore. Cobb cursed them both equally.  
  
  Lake Chatulla was nothing more than a huge, shallow, man-made mudhole with a grass-covered dam running exactly one mile along one end. It sat in the far southwest corner of Ford County, with a few acres in Van Buren County. In the spring it would hold the distinction of being the largest body of water in Mississippi. But by late summer the rains were long gone, and the sun would cook the shallow water until the lake would dehydrate. Its once ambitious shorelines would retreat and move much closer together, creating a depthless basin of reddish brown water. It was fed from all directions by innumerable streams, creeks, sloughs, and a couple of currents large enough to be named rivers. The existence of all these tributaries necessarily gave rise to a good number of bridges near the lake.  
  
  It was over these bridges the yellow pickup flew in an all-out effort to find a suitable place to unload an unwanted passenger. Cobb was desperate. He knew of one other bridge, a narrow wooden one over Foggy Creek. As he approached, he saw niggers with cane poles, so he turned off a side road and stopped the truck. He lowered the tailgate, dragged her out, and threw her in a small ravine lined with kudzu.  
  
  Carl Lee Hailey did not hurry home. Gwen was easily excited, and she had called the mill numerous times when she thought the children had been kidnapped. He punched out at quitting time, and made the thirty-minute drive home in thirty minutes. Anxiety hit him when he turned onto his gravel drive and saw the patrol car parked next to the front porch. Other cars belonging to Owen's family were scattered along the long drive and in the yard, and there was one car he didn't recognize. It had cane poles sticking out the side windows, and there were at least seven straw hats sitting in it.  
  
  Where were Tonya and the boys?  
  
  As he opened the front door he heard Gwen crying. To his right in the small living room he found a crowd huddled above a small figure lying on the couch. The child was covered with wet towels and surrounded by crying relatives. As he moved to the couch the crying stopped and the crowd backed away. Only Gwen stayed by the girl. She softly stroked her hair. He knelt beside the couch and touched the girl's shoulder. He spoke to his daughter, and she tried to smile. Her face was bloody pulp covered with knots and lacerations. Both eyes were swollen shut and bleeding. His eyes watered as he looked at her tiny body, completely wrapped in towels and bleeding from ankles to forehead.  
  
  Carl Lee asked Gwen what happened. She began shaking and wailing, and was led to the kitchen by her brother. Carl Lee stood and turned to the crowd and demanded to know what happened.  
  
  Silence.  
  
  He asked for the third time. The deputy, Willie Hastings, one of Gwen's cousins, stepped forward and told Carl Lee that some people were fishing down by Foggy Creek when they saw Tonya lying in the middle of the road. She told them her daddy's name, and they brought her home.  
  
  Hastings shut up and stared at his feet.  
  
  Carl Lee stared at him and waited. Everyone else stopped breathing and watched the floor.  
  
  ""What happened, Willie?"" Carl Lee yelled as he stared at the deputy.  
  
  Hastings spoke slowly, and while staring out the window repeated what Tonya had told her mother about the white men and their pickup, and the rope and the trees, and being hurt when they got on her. -Hastings stopped when he heard the siren from the ambulance.  
  
  The crowd filed solemnly through the front door and waited on the porch, where they watched the crew unload a stretcher and head for the house.  
  
  The paramedics stopped in the yard when the front door opened and Carl Lee walked out with his daughter in his arms. He whispered gently to her as huge tears dripped from his chin. He walked to the rear of the ambulance and stepped inside. The paramedics closed the door and carefully removed her from his embrace.  
  
  Ozzie Walls was the only black sheriff in Mississippi. There had been a few others in recent history, but for the moment he was the only one. He took great pride in that fact, since Ford County was seventy-four percent white and the other black sheriffs had been from much blacker counties. Not since Reconstruction had a black sheriff been elected in a white county in Mississippi.  
  
  He was raised in Ford County, and he was kin to most of the blacks and a few of the whites. After desegregation in the late sixties, he was a member of the first mixed graduating class at Clanton High School. He wanted to play football nearby at Ole Miss, but there were already two blacks on the team. He starred instead at Alcorn State, and was a defensive tackle for the Rams when a knee injury sent him back to Clanton. He missed football, but enjoyed being the high sheriff, especially at election time when he received more . white votes than his white opponents. The white kids loved him because he was a hero, a football star who had played on TV and had his picture in magazines. Their parents respected him and voted for him because he was a tough cop who did not discriminate between black punks and white  
  
  Sunks. The white politicians supported him because, since e became the sheriff, the Justi  
ce Department stayed out of Ford County. The blacks adored him because he was Ozzie, one of their own.  
  
  He skipped supper and waited in his office at the jail for Hastings to report from the Hailey house. He had a suspect. Billy Ray Cobb was no stranger to the sheriffs office. Ozzie knew he sold drugs-he just couldn't catch him. He also knew Cobb had a mean streak.  
  
  The dispatcher called in the deputies, and as they reported to the jail Ozzie gave them instructions to locate, but not arrest, Billy Ray Cobb. There were twelve deputies in all -nine white and three black. They fanned out across the county in search of a fancy yellow Ford pickup with a rebel flag in the rear window.  
  
  When Hastings arrived he and the sheriff left for the Ford County hospital. As usual, Hastings drove and Ozzie gave orders on the radio. In the waiting room on the second floor they found the Hailey clan. Aunts, uncles, grandparents, friends, and strangers crowded into the small room and some waited in the narrow hallway. There were whispers and quiet tears. Tonya was in surgery.  
  
  Carl Lee sat on a cheap plastic couch in a dark corner with Gwen next to him and the boys next to her. He stared at the floor and did not notice the crowd. Gwen laid her head on his shoulder and cried softly. The boys sat rigidly with their hands on knees, occasionally glancing at their father as if waiting on words of reassurance.  
  
  Ozzie worked his way through the crowd, quietly shaking hands and patting backs and whispering that he would catch them. He knelt before Carl Lee and Gwen. ""How is she?"" he asked. Carl Lee did not see him. Gwen cried louder and the boys sniffed and wiped tears. He patted Gwen on the knee and stood. One of her brothers led Ozzie and Hastings out of the room into the hall, away from the family. He shook Ozzie's hand and thanked him for coming.  
  
  ""How is she?"" Ozzie asked.  
  
  ""Not too good. She's in surgery and most likely will be there for a while. She's got broken fjones and a bad concussion. She's beat up real bad. There's rope burns on her neck like they tried to hang her. ""  
  
  ""Was she raped?"" he asked, certain of the answer.  
  
  ""Yeah. She told her momma they took turns on her and hurt her real bad. Doctors confirmed it. ""  
  
  ""How's Carl Lee and Gwen?""  
  
  ""They're tore up pretty bad. I think they're in shock. Carl Lee ain't said a word since he got here. ""  
  
  JDzzie assured him they would find the two men, and it wouldn't take long, and when they found them they would be locked up someplace safe. The brother suggested he should hide them in another jail, for their own safety.  
  
  Three miles out of Clanton, Ozzie pointed to a gravel driveway. ""Pull in there,"" he told Hastings, who turned off the highway and drove into the front yard of a dilapidated house trailer. It was almost dark.  
  
  Ozzie took his night stick and banged violently on the front door. ""Open up, Bumpous!""  
  
  The trailer shook and Bumpous scrambled to the bathroom to flush a fresh joint.  
  
  ""Open up, Bumpous!"" Ozzie banged. ""I know you're in there. Open up or I'll kick in the door. ""  
  
  Bumpous yanked the door open and Ozzie walked in. ""You know, Bumpous, evertime I visit you I smell somethin' funny and the commode's flushin'. Get some clothes on. I gotta job for you. ""  
  
  ""W-what?""  
  
  ""I'll explain it outside where I can breathe. Just get some clothes on and hurry. ""  
  
  ""What if I don't want to?""  
  
  ""Fine. I'll see your parole officer tomorrow. ""  
  
  ""I'll be out in a minute. ""  
  
  Ozzie smiled and walked to his car. Bobby Bumpous was one of his favorites. Since his parole two years earlier, he had led a reasonably clean life, occasionally succumbing to the lure of an easy drug sale for a quick buck. Ozzie watched him like a hawk and knew of such transactions, and Bumpous knew Ozzie knew; therefore, Bumpous was usually most eager to help his friend, Sheriff Walls. The plan was to eventually use Bumpous to nail Billy Ray Cobb for dealing, but that would be postponed for now.  
  
  After a few minutes he marched outside, still tucking his shirttail and zipping his pants. ""Who you lookin' for?"" he demanded.  
  
  ""Billy Ray Cobb. ""  
  
  ""That's no problem. You can find him without me. ""  
  
  ""Shut up and listen. We think Cobb was involved in a rape this afternoon. A black girl was raped by two white men, and I think Cobb was there. ""  
  
  ""Cobb ain't into rape, Sheriff. He's into drugs, remember?""  
  
  ""Shut up and listen. You find Cobb and spend some time with him. Five minutes ago his truck was spotted at Huey's. Buy him a beer. Shoot some pool, roll dice, whatever. Find out what he did today. Who was he with? Where'd he go? You know how he likes to talk, right?""  
  
  ""Right. ""  
  
  ""Call the dispatcher when you find him. They'll call me. I'll be somewhere close. You understand?""  
  
  ""Sure, Sheriff. No problem. ""  
  
  ""Any questions?""  
  
  ""Yeah. I'm broke. Who's gonna pay for this?""  
  
  Ozzie handed him a twenty and left. Hastings drove in the direction of Huey's, down by the lake.  
  
  ""You sure you can trust him?"" Hastings asked. . ""Who?""  
  
  ""That Bumpous kid. ""  
  
  ""Sure I trust him. He's proved very reliable since he was paroled. He's a good kid tryin' to go straight, for the most part. He supports his local sheriff and would do anything I ask. ""  
  
  ""Why?""  
  
  ""Because I caught him with ten ounces of pot a year ago. He'd been outta jail about a year when I caught his brother with an ounce, and I told him he was lookin' at thirty years. He started cryin' and carryin' on, cried all night in his cell. By mornin' he was ready to talk. Told me his supplier was his brother, Bobby. So I let him go and went to see Bobby. I knocked on his door and I could hear the commode flushin'. He wouldn't come to the door, so I kicked it in. I found him in his underwear in the bathroom tryin' to unstop the commode. There was dope all over the place. Don't know how much he flushed, but most of it was comin' back out in the overflow. Scared him so bad he wet his drawers. ""  
  
  ""You kiddin'?""  
  
  ""Nope. The kid pissed all over himself. He was a sight standin' there with wet drawers, a plunger in one hand, dope in the other, and the room fillin' up with commode water. ""  
  
  ""What'd you do?""  
  
  ""Threatened to kill him. ""  
  
  ""What'd he do?""  
  
  ""Started cryin'. Cried like a baby. Cried 'bout his momma and prison and all this and that. Promised he'd never screw up again. ""  
  
  ""You arrest him?""  
  
  ""Naw, I just couldn't. I talked real ugly to him and threatened him some more. I put him on probation right there in his bathroom. He's been fun to work with ever since. ""  
  
  They drove by Huey's and saw Cobb's truck in the gravel parking lot with a dozen other pickups and four-wheel drives. They parked behind a black church on a hill up the highway from Huey's, where they had a good view of the honky tonk, or tonk, as it was affectionately called by the patrons. Another patrol car hid behind some trees at the other end of the highway. Moments later Bumpous flew by and wheeled into the parking lot. He locked his brakes, spraying gravel and dust, then backed next to Cobb's truck. He looked around and casually entered Huey's. Thirty minutes later the dispatcher advised Ozzie that the informant had found the subject, a male white, at Huey's, an establishment on Highway 305 near the lake. Within minutes two more patrol cars were hidden close by. They waited.  
  
  ""What makes you so sure it's Cobb?"" Hastings asked.  
  
  ""I ain't sure. I just got a hunch. The little girl said it was a truck with shiny wheels and big tires. ""  
  
  ""That narrows it down to two thousand. ""  
  
  ""She also said it was yellow, looked new, and had a big flag hangin' in the rear window. ""  
  
  ""That brings it down to two hundred. ""  
  
  ""Maybe less than that. How many of those are as mean as Billy Ray Cobb?""  
  
  ""What if it ain't him?""  
  
  ""It is. ""  
  
  ""If it ain't?""  
  
  ""We'll know shortly. He's got a big mouth, 'specially when he's drinkin'. ""  
  
  For two hours t  
hey waited and watched pickups come and go. Truck drivers, pulpwood cutters, factory workers, and farmhands parked their pickups and jeeps in the gravel and strutted inside to drink, shoot pool, listen to the band, but mainly to look for stray women. Some would leave and walk next door to Ann's Lounge, where they would stay for a few minutes and return to Huey's. Ann's Lounge was darker both inside and out, and it lacked the colorful beer signs and live music that made Huey's such a hit with the locals. Ann's  
  
  was known for its drug traffic, whereas Huey's had it all- music, women, happy hours, poker machines, dice, dancing, and plenty of fights. One brawl spilled through the door into the parking lot, where a group of wild rednecks kicked and clawed each other at random until they grew winded and returned to the dice table.  
  
  ""Hope that wasn't Bumpous,"" observed the sheriff.  
  
  The restrooms inside were small and nasty, and most of the patrons found it necessary to relieve themselves between the pickups in the parking lot. This was especially true on Mondays when ten-cent beer night drew rednecks from four counties and every truck in the parking lot received at least three sprayings. About once a week an innocent passing motorist would get shocked by something he or she saw in the parking lot, and Ozzie would be forced to make an arrest. Otherwise, he left the places alone.  
  
  Both tonks were in violation of numerous laws. There was gambling, drugs, illegal whiskey, minors, they refused to close on time, etc. Shortly after he was elected the first time Ozzie made the mistake, due in part to a hasty campaign promise, of closing all the honky tonks in the county. It was a horrible mistake. The crime rate soared. The jail was packed. The court dockets multiplied. The rednecks united and drove in caravans to Clanton, where they parked around the courthouse on the square. Hundreds of them. Every night they invaded the square, drinking, fighting, playing loud music, and shouting obscenities at the horrified town folk. Each morning the square resembled a landfill with cans and bottles thrown everywhere. He closed the black tonks too, and break-ins, burglaries, and stabbings tripled in one month. There were two murders in one week.  
  
  Finally, with the city under siege, a group of local ministers met secretly with Ozzie and begged him to ease up on the tonks. He politely reminded them that during the campaign they had insisted on the closings. They admitted they were wrong and pleaded for relief. Yes, they would support him in the next election. Ozzie relented, and life returned to normal in Ford County.  
  
  Ozzie was not pleased that the establishments thrived in his county, but he was convinced beyond any doubt that his law-abiding constituents were much safer when the tonks were open.  
  
  At ten-thirty the dispatcher radioed that the informant was on the phone and wanted to see the sheriff. Ozzie gave his location, and a minute later they watched Bumpous emerge and stagger to his truck. He spun tires, slung gravel, and raced toward the church.  
  
  ""He's drunk,"" said Hastings.  
  
  He wheeled through the church parking lot and came to a screeching stop a few feet from the patrol car. ""Howdy, Sheriff!"" he yelled.  
  
  Ozzie walked to the pickup. ""What took so long?""  
  
  ""You told me to take all night. ""  
  
  ""You found him two hours ago. ""  
  
  ""That's true, Sheriff, but have you ever tried to spend twenty dollars on beer when it's fifty cents a can?""  
  
  ""You drunk?""  
  
  ""Naw, just havin' a good time. Could I have another twenty?""  
  
  ""What'd you find out?""  
  
  "" 'Bout what?""  
  
  ""Cobb!""  
  
  ""Oh, he's in there all right. ""  
  
  ""I know he's in there! What else?""  
  
  Bumpous quit smiling and looked at the tonk in the distance. ""He's laughin' about it, Sheriff. It's a big joke. Said he finally found a nigger who was a virgin. Somebody asked how old she was, and Cobb said eight or nine. Everybody laughed. ""  
  
  Hastings closed his eyes and dropped his head. Ozzie gritted his teeth and looked away. ""What else did he say?""  
  
  ""He's bad drunk. He won't remember any of it in the mornin'. Said she was a cute little nigger. ""  
  
  ""Who was with him?""  
  
  ""Pete Willard. ""  
  
  ""Is he in there?""  
  
  ""Yep, they're both laughin' about it. ""  
  
  ""Where are they?""  
  
  ""Left-hand side, next to the pinball machines. ""  
  
  Ozzie smiled. ""Okay, Bumpous. You did good. Get lost. ""  
  
  Hastings called the dispatcher with the two names. The dispatcher relayed the message to Deputy Looney, who was parked in the street in front of the home of County Judge Percy Bullard. Looney rang the doorbell and handed the judge two affidavits and two arrest warrants. Bullard scribbled on the warrants and returned them to Looney, who thanked His Honor and left. Twenty minutes later Looney handed the warrants to Ozzie behind the church.  
  
  At exactly eleven, the band quit in mid-song, the dice disappeared, the dancers froze, the cue balls stopped rolling, and someone turned on the lights. All eyes followed the big sheriff as he and his men swaggered slowly across the dance floor to a table by the pinball machines. Cobb, Willard, and two others sat in a booth, the table littered with empty beer cans Ozzie walked to the table and grinned at Cobb.  
  
  ""I'm sorry, sir, but we don't allow niggers in here,"" Cobb blurted out, and the four burst into laughter. Ozzie kept grinning.  
  
  When the laughing stopped, Ozzie said, ""You boys havin' a good time, Billy Ray?""  
  
  ""We was. ""  
  
  ""Looks like it. I hate to break things up, but you and Mr. Willard need to come with me. ""  
  
  ""Where we goin'?"" Willard asked.  
  
  ""For a ride. ""  
  
  ""I ain't movin',"" Cobb vowed. With that, the other two scooted from the booth and joined the spectators.  
  
  ""I'm placin' you both under arrest,"" Ozzie said.  
  
  ""You got warrants?"" Cobb asked.  
  
  Hastings produced the warrants, and Ozzie threw them among the beer cans. ""Yeah, we got warrants. Now get up. ""  
  
  Willard stared desperately at Cobb, who sipped a beer and said, ""I ain't goin' to jail. ""  
  
  Looney handed Ozzie the longest, blackest nightstick ever used in Ford County. Willard was panic-stricken. Ozzie cocked it and struck the center of the table, sending beer and cans and foam in all directions. Willard bolted upright, slapped his wrists together and thrust them at Looney, who was waiting with the handcuffs. He was dragged outside and thrown into a patrol car.  
  
  Ozzie tapped his left palm with the stick and grinned at  
  
  Cobb. ""You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be used against you in court. You have the right to a lawyer. If you can't afford one, the state'll furnish one. Any questions?""  
  
  ""Yeah, what time is it?""  
  
  ""Time to go to jail, big man. ""  
  
  ""Go to hell, nigger. ""  
  
  Ozzie grabbed his hair and lifted him from the booth, then drove his face into the floor. He jammed a knee into his spine and slid his nightstick under his throat, and pulled upward while driving the knee deeper into his back. Cobb squealed until the stick began crushing his larynx.  
  
  The handcuffs were slapped into place, and Ozzie dragged him by his hair across the dance floor, out the door, across the gravel and threw him into the back seat with Wil-lard.  
  
  News of the rape spread quickly. More friends and relatives crowded into the waiting room and the halls around it. Tonya was out of surgery and listed as critical. Ozzie talked to Gwen's brother in the hall and told of the arrests. Yes, they were the ones, he was sure.  
  
  Jake Brigance rolled across his wife and staggered to the small bathroom a few feet from his bed, where he searched and groped in the dark for the screaming alarm clock. He found it where he had left it, and killed it with a quick and violent slap. It was 5:30 A. M. , Wednesday, May 15.  
  
  He stood in the dark for a moment, breathless, terrified, his heart pounding rapidly, staring at the fluorescent numbers glowing at him from the face of the clock, a clock he hated. Its piercing scream could be heard down the street. He flirted with  
cardiac arrest every morning at this time when the thing erupted. On occasion, about twice a year, he was successful in shoving Carla onto the floor, and she would maybe turn it off before returning to bed. Most of the time, however, she was not sympathetic. She thought he was crazy for getting up at such an hour.  
  
  The clock sat on the windowsill so that Jake was required to move around a bit before it was silenced. Once up, Jake would not permit himself to crawl back under the covers. It was one of his rules. At one time the alarm was on the nightstand, and the volume was reduced. Carla would reach and turn it off before Jake heard anything. Then he would sleep until seven or eight and ruin his entire day. He would miss being in the office by seven, which was another rule. The alarm stayed in the bathroom and served its purpose.  
  
  Jake stepped to the sink and splashed cold water on'his face and hair. He switched on the light and gasped in horror at the sight in the mirror. His straight brown hair shot in all directions, and the hairline had receded at least two inches during the night. Either that or his forehead had grown. His eyes were matted and swollen with the white stuff packed in the corners. A seam in a blanket left a bright red scar along the left side of his face. He touched, then rubbed it and wondered if it would go away. With his right hand he pushed his hair back and inspected the hairline. At thirty-two, he had no gray hair. Gray hair was not the problem. The problem was pattern baldness, which Jake had richly inherited from both sides of his family. He longed for a full, thick hairline beginning an inch above his eyebrows. He still had plenty of hair, Carla told him. But it wouldn't last long at the rate it was disappearing. She also assured him he was as handsome as ever, and he believed her. She had explained that a receding hairline gave him a look of maturity that was essential for a young attorney. He believed that too.  
  
  But what about old, bald attorneys, or even mature, middle-aged bald attorneys? Why couldn't the hair return after he grew wrinkles and gray sideburns and looked very mature?  
  
  Jake pondered these things in the shower. He took quick showers, and he shaved and dressed quickly. He had to be at the Coffee Shop at 6:00 A. M. -another rule. He turned on lights and slammed and banged drawers and closet doors in an effort to arouse Carla. This was the morning ritual during the summer when she was not teaching school. He had explained to her numerous times that she had all day to catch up on any lost sleep, and that these early moments should be spent together. She moaned and tunneled deeper under the covers. Once dressed, Jake jumped on the bed with all fours and kissed her in the ear, down the neck, and all over the face until she finally swung at him. Then he yanked the covers off the bed and laughed as she curled up and shivered and begged for the blankets. He held them and admired her dark, tanned, thin, almost perfect legs. The bulky nightshirt covered nothing below the waist, and a hundred lewd thoughts danced before him.  
  
  About once a month this ritual would get out of hand. She would not protest, and the blankets would be jointly removed. On those mornings Jake undressed even quicker and broke at least three of his rules. That's how Hanna was conceived.  
  
  But not this morning. He covered his wife, kissed her gently, and turned out the lights. She breathed easier, and fell asleep.  
  
  Down the hall he quietly opened Hanna's door and knelt beside her. She was four, the only child, and there would be no others. She lay in her bed surrounded by dolls and stuffed animals. He kissed her lightly on the cheek. She was as beautiful as her mother, and the two were identical in looks and manners. They had large bluish-gray eyes that could cry instantly, if necessary. They wore their dark hair the same way-had it cut by the same person at the same time. They even dressed alike.  
  
  Jake adored the two women in his life. He kissed the second one goodbye and went to the kitchen to make coffee for Carla. On his way out he released Max, the mutt, into the backyard, where she simultaneously relieved herself and barked at Mrs. Pickle's cat next door.  
  
  Few people attacked the morning like Jake Brigance. He walked briskly to the end of the driveway and got the morning papers for Carla. It was dark, clear, and cool with the promise of summer rapidly approaching.  
  
  He studied the darkness up and down Adams Street, then turned and admired his house. Two homes in Ford County were on the National Register of Historic Places, and Jake Brigance owned one of them. Although it was heavily mortgaged, he was proud of it nonetheless. It was a nineteenth-century Victorian built by a retired railroad man who died on the first Christmas Eve he spent in his new home. The facade was a huge, centered gable with hipped roof over a wide, inset front porch. Under the gable a small portico covered with bargeboard hung gently over the porch. The five supporting pillars were round and painted white and slate blue. Each column bore a handmade floral carving, each with a different flower-daffodils, irises, and sunflowers. The railing between the pillars was filled with lavish lacework. Upstairs, three bay windows opened onto a small balcony, and to the left of the balcony an octagonal tower with stained-glass windows protruded and rose above the gable until it peaked with an iron-crested finial. Below the tower and to the left of the porch, a wide, graceful veranda with ornamental railing extended from the house and served as a carport. The front panels were a collage of gingerbread, cedar shingles, scallops, fish scales, tiny intricate gables, and miniature spindles.

I got quite a few matches, but one local Chinese-Malaysian guy stood out immediately. He was very proactive in messaging me, and once he realized I’m from China, he even switched to Chinese to make me feel more at ease—which I really appreciated.

After chatting for just one day, he asked to meet up. To my surprise, our first meeting was… kind of perfect. He was extremely gentlemanly, thoughtful, and attentive. He chose a really nice restaurant, and judging from the car he drove, he seems to be doing quite well financially.

Right after that first date, he asked to see me again the next day. He spent time introducing me to this country and city, even took me to his favorite restaurant and a cocktail bar where the bartender—who seemed to know him well—joked that I was the *first girl* he ever brought there (though of course, I’m not taking that at face value).

Throughout all our interactions, he has been nothing but kind, warm, considerate, and mature. It all just feels… too good to be true. Is it really possible to meet someone *this* seemingly perfect on the first try? Or should I be worried there’s some kind of catch?

I’d love to hear from local women—what do you think? Is this normal or should I be cautious?",1,1749784017.0,coffeemeetsbagel,0,1.0,False

I’m not surprised to see the faux-surfer hair stink-eye guy sitting with her. St. Clair is talking about classes—what to expect my first day, who.....","We get in line to pay, and I’m surprised by how efficiently it runs. My old school was all about cutting ahead and incensing the lunch ladies, but here everyone waits patiently. I turn back just in time to catch his eyes flicker up and down my body. My breath catches. The beautiful boy is checking me out. He doesn’t realize I’ve caught him. “My mum is American,” he continues smoothly. “My father is French. I was born in San Francisco, and I was raised in London.”  Miraculously, I find my voice. “A true international.  He laughs. “That’s right. I’m not a poseur like the rest of you.”  I’m about to tease him back when I remember: He has a girlfriend. Something evil pokes the pink folds of my brain, forcing me to recall my conversation with Meredith last night. It’s time to change the subject. “What’s your real name? Last night you introduced yourself as—”  “St. Clair is my last name. Étienne is my first.  “Étienne St. Clair.” I try to pronounce it like him, all foreign and posh.  “Terrible, isn’t it?”  
  I’m laughing now. “Étienne is nice. Why don’t people call you that?  “Oh, ‘Étienne is nice.’ How generous of you.”  Another person gets in line behind us, a tiny boy with brown skin, acne, and a thick mat of black hair. The boy is excited to see him, and he smiles back. “Hey, Nikhil. Did you have a nice holiday?” It’s the same question he asked Amanda, but this time his tone is sincere.  
 That’s all it takes for the boy to launch into a story about his trip to Delhi, about the markets and temples and monsoons. (He went on a day trip to the Taj Mahal. I went to Panama City Beach with the rest of Georgia.) Another boy runs up, this one skinny and pale with sticky-uppy hair. Nikhil forgets us and greets his friend with the same enthusiastic babble.  
  St. Clair—I’m determined to call him this before I embarrass myself—turns back to me. “Nikhil is Rashmi’s brother. He’s a freshman this year. She also has a younger sister, Sanjita, who’s a junior, and an older sister, Leela, who graduated two years ago.”  
  
  “Do you have any brothers or sisters?”  
  
  “No. You?”  
  
  “One brother, but he’s back home. In Atlanta. That’s in Georgia. In the South?”  
  
  He raises an eyebrow. “I know where Atlanta is.”  
  
  “Oh. Right.” I hand my meal card to the man behind the register. Like Monsieur Boutin, he wears a pressed white uniform and starched hat. He also has a handlebar mustache. Huh. Didn’t know they had those over here. Chef Handlebar swipes my card and zips it back to me with a quick merci.  
  
  Thank you. Another word I already knew. Excellent.  
  
  On the way back to our table, Amanda watches St. Clair from inside her posse of Pretty Preppy People. I’m not surprised to see the faux-surfer hair stink-eye guy sitting with her. St. Clair is talking about classes—what to expect my first day, who my teachers are—but I’ve stopped listening. All I know is his crooked-tooth smile and his confident swaggery walk.  
  
  I’m just as big a fool as the rest of them.  
  
  chapter four  
  
  The H-through-P line moves slowly. The guy ahead of me is arguing with the guidance counselor. I glance at A-through-G, and see Meredith (Chevalier) and Rashmi (Devi) have already received their class schedules and exchanged them for comparison.  
  
  “But I didn’t ask for theater, I asked for computer science.”  
  
  The squat counselor is patient. “I know, but computer science didn’t fit with your schedule, and your alternate did. Maybe you can take computer science next—”  
  
  “My alternate was computer programming.”  
  
  Hold it. My attention snaps back. Can they do that? Put us in a class we didn’t ask for? I will die—DIE—if I have to take gym again.  
  
  “Actually, David.” The counselor sifts through her papers. “You neglected to fill out your alternate form, so we had to select the class for you. But I think you’ll find—”  
  
  The angry boy snatches his schedule from her hands and stalks off. Yikes. It’s not like it’s her fault. I step forward and say my name as kindly as possible, to make up for the jerk who just left. She gives a dimpled smile back. “I remember you, sweetie. Have a nice first day.” And she hands me a half sheet of yellow paper.  
  
  I hold my breath while I scan it. Phew. No surprises. Senior English, calculus, beginning French, physics, European history, and something dubiously called “La Vie.”  
  
  When I registered, the counselor described “Life” as a senior-only class, similar to a study hall but with occasional guest speakers who will lecture us about balancing checkbooks and renting apartments and baking quiches. Or whatever. I’m just relieved Mom let me take it. One of the decent things about this school is that math, science, and history aren’t required for seniors. Unfortunately, Mom is a purist and refused to let me graduate without another year of all three. “You’ll never get into the right college if you take ceramics,” she warned, frowning over my orientation packet.  
  
  Thanks, Mom. Send me away for some culture in a city known for its art and make me suffer through another math class. I shuffle toward Meredith and Rashmi, feeling like the third wheel but praying for some shared classes. I’m in luck. “Three with me and four with Rash!” Meredith beams and hands back my schedule. Her rainbow-colored plastic rings click against each other.  
  
  Rash. What an unfortunate nickname. They gossip about people I don’t know, and my mind wanders to the other side of the courtyard, where St. Clair waits with Josh in Q-through-Z. I wonder if I have any classes with him.  
  
  I mean, them. Classes with them.  
  
  The rain has stopped, and Josh kicks a puddle in St. Clair’s direction. St. Clair laughs and says something that makes them both laugh even harder. Suddenly I register that St. Clair is shorter than Josh. Much shorter. It’s odd I didn’t notice earlier, but he doesn’t carry himself like a short guy. Most are shy or defensive, or some messed-up combination of the two, but St. Clair is confident and friendly and—  
  
  “Jeez, stare much?”  
  
  “What?” I jerk my head back, but Rashmi’s not talking to me. She’s shaking her head at Meredith, who looks as sheepish as I feel.  
  
  “You’re burning holes into St. Clair’s head. It’s not attractive.”  
  
  “Shut up.” But Meredith smiles at me and shrugs.  
  
  Well. That settles that. As if I needed another reason not to lust. Boy Wonder is officially off-limits. “Don’t say anything to him,” she says. “Please.”  
  
  “Of course,” I say.  
  
  “Because we’re obviously just friends.”  
  
  “Obviously.”  
  
  We mill around until the head of school arrives for her welcome speech. The head is graceful and carries herself like a ballerina. She has a long neck, and her snow-white hair is pulled into a tidy knot that makes her look distinguished rather than elderly. The overall effect is Parisian, although I know from my acceptance letter she’s from Chicago. Her gaze glides across us, her one hundred handpicked pupils. “Welcome to another exciting year at the School of America in Paris. I’m pleased to see so many familiar faces, and I’m even happier to see the new ones.”  
  
  Apparently school speeches are one thing France can’t improve.  
  
  “To the students who attended last year, I invite you all to give a warm welcome to your new freshman class and to the new upperclassmen, as well.”  
  
  A smattering of polite applause. I glance around, and I’m startled to find St. Clair looking at me. He claps and lifts his hands in my direction. I blush and jerk away.  
  
  The head keeps talking. Focus, Anna. Focus. But I feel his stare as if it were the heat of the sun. My skin grows moist with sweat. I slide underneath one of the immaculately pruned trees. Why is he staring? Is he still staring? I think he is. Why why why? Is it a good stare or a bad stare or an indifferent stare?  
  
  But when I finally look, he’s not staring at me at all. He’s biting his pinkie nail.  
  
  The head wraps up, and Rashmi bounds off to jo  
in the guys. Meredith leads me inside for English. The professeur hasn’t arrived yet, so we choose seats in the back. The classroom is smaller than what I’m used to, and it has dark, gleaming trim and tall windows that look like doors. But the desks are the same, and the whiteboard and the wall-mounted pencil sharpener. I concentrate on these familiar items to ease my nerves.  
  
  “You’ll like Professeur Cole,” Meredith says. “She’s hilarious, and she always assigns the best books.”  
  
  “My dad is a novelist.” I blurt this without thinking and immediately regret it.  
  
  “Really? Who?”  
  
  “James Ashley.” That’s his pen name. I guess Oliphant wasn’t romantic enough.  
  
  “Who?”  
  
  The humiliation factor multiplies. “The Decision? The Entrance? They were made into movies. Forget it, they all have vague names like that—”  
  
  She leans forward, excited. “No, my mom loves The Entrance!”  
  
  I wrinkle my nose.  
  
  “They aren’t that bad. I watched The Entrance with her once and totally cried when that girl died of leukemia.”  
  
  “Who died of leukemia?” Rashmi plops her backpack down next to me. St. Clair trails in behind her and takes the seat in front of Meredith.  
  
  “Anna’s dad wrote The Entrance,” Meredith says.  
  
  I cough. “Not something I’m proud of.”  
  
  “I’m sorry, what’s The Entrance?” Rashmi asks.  
  
  “It’s that movie about the boy who helps deliver the baby girl in the elevator, and then he grows up to fall in love with her,” Meredith says as St. Clair leans back in his chair and nabs her schedule. “But the day after their engagement, she’s diagnosed with leukemia.”  
  
  “Her father pushes her down the aisle in a wheelchair,” I continue. “And then she dies on the honeymoon.”  
  
  “Ugh,” Rashmi and St. Clair say together.  
  
  Enough embarrassment. “Where’s Josh?” I ask.  
  
  “He’s a junior,” Rashmi says, as if I should have known this already. “We dropped him off at pre-calc.”  
  
  “Oh.” Our conversation hits a dead end. Lovely.  
  
  “Three classes together, Mer. Give us yours.” St. Clair leans back again and steals my half sheet. “Ooo, beginning French.”  
  
  “Told you.”  
  
  “It’s not so bad.” He hands back my schedule and smiles. “You’ll be reading the breakfast menu without me before you know it.”  
  
  Hmm, maybe I don’t want to learn French.  
  
  Argh! Boys turn girls into such idiots.  
  
  “Bonjour à tous.” A woman wearing a bold turquoise dress strides in and smacks her coffee cup down on the podium. She’s youngish, and she has the blondest hair I’ve ever seen on a teacher. “For the—” Her eyes scan the room until they land on me.  
  
  What? What did I do?  
  
  “For the singular person who doesn’t know me, je m’appelle Professeur Cole.” She gives an exaggerated curtsy, and the class laughs. They swivel around to stare.  
  
  “Hello,” I say in a tiny voice.  
  
  Suspicions confirmed. Out of the twenty-five people present—the entire senior class—I’m the only new student. This means my classmates have yet another advantage over me, because every one of them is familiar with the teachers. The school is so small that each subject is taught by the same professeur in all four grades.  
  
  I wonder what student left to vacate my position? Probably someone cooler than me. Someone with dreadlocks and pinup girl tattoos and connections in the music industry.  
  
  “I see the janitorial staff has ignored my wishes once again,” Professeur Cole says. “Everyone [up.You](http://up.You) know the drill.”  
  
  I don’t, but I push my desk when everyone else starts pushing theirs. We arrange them in a big circle. It’s odd to see all of my classmates at the same time. I take the opportunity to size them up. I don’t think I stand out, but their jeans and shoes and backpacks are more expensive than mine. They look cleaner, shinier.  
  
  No surprise there. My mom is a high school biology teacher, which doesn’t give us a lot of extra spending money. Dad pays for the mortgage and helps with the bills, but it’s not enough, and Mom is too proud to ask for more. She says he’d refuse her anyway and just go buy another elliptical machine.  
  
  There may be some truth to that.  
  
  The rest of the morning passes in a blur. I like Professeur Cole, and my math teacher, Professeur Babineaux, is nice enough. He’s Parisian, and he waggles his eyebrows and spits when he [talks.To](http://talks.To) be fair, I don’t think the spitting is a French thing. I think he just has a lisp. It’s hard to tell with the accent.  
  
  After that, I have beginning French. Professeur Gillet turns out to be another Parisian. Figures. They always send in native speakers for foreign language classes. My Spanish teachers were always rolling their eyes and exclaiming, “¡Aye, dios mio!” whenever I raised my hand. They got frustrated when I couldn’t grasp a concept that seemed obvious to them.  
  
  I stopped raising my hand.  
  
  As predicted, the class is a bunch of freshmen. And me. Oh, and one junior, the angry scheduling guy from this morning. He introduces himself enthusiastically as Dave, and I can tell he’s as relieved as I am to not be the only upperclassman.  
  
  Maybe Dave is pretty cool after all.  
  
  At noon, I follow the stampede to the cafeteria. I avoid the main line and go straight to the counter with the choose-your-own fruit and bread, even though the pasta smells amazing. I’m such a wuss. I’d rather starve than try to order in French. “Oui, oui!” I’d say, pointing at random words on the chalkboard. Then Chef Handlebar would present me with something revolting, and I’d have to buy it out of shame. Of course I meant to order the roasted pigeon! Mmm! Just like Nanna’s.  
  
  Meredith and her friends are lounging at the same table as this morning. I take a deep breath and join them. To my relief, no one looks surprised. Meredith asks St. Clair if he’s seen his girlfriend yet. He relaxes into his chair. “No, but we’re meeting tonight.”  
  
  “Did you see her this summer? Have her classes started? What’s she taking this semester?” She keeps asking questions about Ellie to which he gives short replies. Josh and Rashmi are making out—I can actually see tongue—so I turn to my bread and grapes. How biblical of me.  
  
  The grapes are smaller than I’m used to, and the skin is slightly textured. Is that dirt? I dip my napkin in water and dab at the tiny purple globes. It helps, but they’re still sort of rough. Hmm. St. Clair and Meredith stop talking. I glance up to find them staring at me in matching bemusement. “What?”  
  
  “Nothing,” he says. “Continue your grape bath.”  
  
  “They were dirty.”  
  
  “Have you tried one?” she asks.  
  
  “No, they’ve still got these little mud flecks.” I hold one up to show them. St. Clair plucks it from my fingers and pops it into his mouth. I’m hypnotized by his lips, his throat, as he swallows.  
  
  I hesitate.Would I rather have clean food or his good opinion?  
  
  He picks up another and smiles. “Open up.”  
  
  I open up.  
  
  The grape brushes my lower lip as he slides it in. It explodes in my mouth, and I’m so startled by the juice that I nearly spit it out.The flavor is intense, more like grape candy than actual fruit. To say I’ve tasted nothing like it before is an understatement. Meredith and St. Clair laugh. “Wait until you try them as wine,” she says.  
  
  St. Clair twirls a forkful of pasta. “So. How was French class?”  
  
  The abrupt subject change makes me shudder. “Professeur Gillet is scary. She’s all frown lines.” I tear off a piece of baguette. The crust crackles, and the inside is light and springy. Oh, man. I shove another hunk into my mouth.  
  
  Meredith looks thoughtful. “She can be intimidating at first, but she’s really nice once you get to know her.”  
  
  “Mer is her star pupil,” St. Clair says.  
  
  Rashmi breaks apart from Josh, who looks dazed by the fresh air. “She’s taking advanced French and advanced Spanish,” she adds.  
  
  “Maybe you can  
be my tutor,” I say to Meredith. “I stink at foreign languages. The only reason this place overlooked my Spanish grades was because the head reads my father’s dumb novels.”  
  
  “How do you know?” she asks.  
  
  I roll my eyes. “She mentioned it once or twice in my phone interview.” She kept asking questions about casting decisions for The Lighthouse. Like Dad has any say in that. Or like I care. She didn’t realize my cinematic tastes are a bit more sophisticated.  
  
  “I’d like to learn Italian,” Meredith says. “But they don’t offer it here. I want to go to college in Rome next year. Or maybe London. I could study it there, too.”  
  
  “Surely Rome is a better place to study Italian?” I ask.  
  
  “Yeah, well.” She steals a glance at St. Clair. “I’ve always liked London.”  
  
  Poor Mer. She’s got it bad.  
  
  “What do you want to do?” I ask him. “Where are you going?”  
  
  St. Clair shrugs. It’s slow and full-bodied, surprisingly French. The same shrug the waiter at the restaurant last night gave me when I asked if they served pizza. “Don’t know. It depends, though I’d like to study history.” He leans forward, like he’s about to share a naughty secret. “I’ve always wanted to be one of those blokes they interview on BBC or PBS [specials.You](http://specials.You) know, with the crazy eyebrows and suede elbow patches.”  
  
  Just like me! Sort of. “I want to be on the classic movies channel and discuss Hitchcock and Capra with Robert Osborne. He hosts most of their programs. I mean I know he’s an old dude, but he’s so freaking cool. He knows everything about film.”  
  
  “Really?” He sounds genuinely interested.  
  
  “St. Clair’s head is always in history books the size of dictionaries,” Meredith interrupts. “It’s hard to get him out of his room.”  
  
  “That’s because Ellie’s always in there,” Rashmi says drily.  
  
  “You’re one to talk.” He gestures toward Josh. “Not to mention . . . Henri.”  
  
  “Henri!” Meredith says, and she and St. Clair burst into laughter.  
  
  “One frigging afternoon, and you’ll never let me forget it.” Rashmi glances at Josh, who stabs his pasta.   “Who’s Henri?” I trip over the pronunciation. En-ree.  
  
  “This tour guide on a field trip to Versailles sophomore year,” St. Clair says. “Skinny little bugger, but Rashmi ditched us in the Hall of Mirrors and threw herself at him—”  
  
  “I did not!”  
  
  Meredith shakes her head. “They groped, like, all afternoon. Full public display.”  
  
  “The whole school waited on the bus for two hours, because she forgot what time we were supposed to meet back,” he says.  
  
  “It was NOT two hours—”  
  
  Meredith continues. “Professeur Hansen finally tracked her down behind some shrubbery in the formal gardens, and she had teeth marks all over her neck.”  
  
  “Teeth marks!” St. Clair snorts.  
  
  Rashmi fumes. “Shut up, English Tongue.”  
  
  “Huh?”  
  
  “English Tongue,” she says. “That’s what we all called you after your and Ellie’s breathtaking display at the street fair last spring.” St. Clair tries to protest, but he’s laughing too hard. Meredith and Rashmi continue jabbing back and forth, but . . . I’m lost again. I wonder if Matt is a better kisser now that he has someone more experienced to practice on. He was probably a bad kisser because of me.  
  
  Oh, no.  
  
  I’m a bad kisser. I am, I must be.  
  
  Someday I’ll be awarded a statue shaped like a pair of lips, and it’ll be engraved with the words WORLD’S WORST KISSER. And Matt will give a speech about how he only dated me because he was desperate, but I didn’t put out, so I was a waste of time because Cherrie Milliken liked him all along and she totally puts out. Everyone knows it.  
  
  Oh God. Does Toph think I’m a bad kisser?  
  
  It only happened once. My last night at the movie theater was also the last night before I left for France. It was slow, and we’d been alone in the lobby for most of the evening. Maybe because it was my final shift, maybe because we wouldn’t see each other again for four months, maybe because it felt like a last chance—whatever the reason, we were reckless. We were brave. The flirting escalated all night long, and by the time we were told to go home, we couldn’t walk away. We just kept . . . drawing out the conversation.  
  
  And then, finally, he said he would miss me.  
  
  And then, finally, he kissed me under the buzzing marquee.  
  
  And then I left.  
  
  “Anna? Are you all right?” someone asks.  
  
  The whole table is staring at me.  
  
  Don’t cry. Don’t cry. Don’t cry. “Um.Where’s the bathroom?” The bathroom is my favorite excuse for any situation. No one ever inquires further once you mention it.  
  
  “The toilets are down the hall.” St. Clair looks concerned but doesn’t dare ask. He’s probably afraid I’ll talk about tampon absorbency or mention the dreaded P-word.  
  
  I spend the rest of lunch in a stall. I miss home so much that it physically hurts. My head throbs, my stomach is nauseous, and it’s all so unfair. I never asked to be sent here. I had my own friends and my own inside jokes and my own stolen kisses. I wish my parents had offered me the choice: “Would you like to spend your senior year in Atlanta or Paris?”  
  
  Who knows? Maybe I would have picked Paris.  
  
  What my parents never considered is that I just wanted a choice.  
  
  chapter five  
  
  To: Anna Oliphant  
  
  From: Bridgette Saunderwick  
  
  Subject: Don’t look now but . . .  
  
  ... the bottom right corner of your bed is untucked. HA! Made you look. Now stop smoothing out invisible wrinkles. Seriously. How’s Le Academe du Fraunch? Any hotties I should know about? Speaking of, guess who’s in my calc class?? Drew! He dyed his hair black and got a lip ring. And he’s totally callipygian (look it up, lazy ass). I sat with the usual at lunch, but it wasn’t the same without you. Not to mention freaking Cherrie showed up. She kept flipping her hair around, and I swear I heard you humming that TRESemmé commercial. I’ll gouge out my eyes with Sean’s Darth Maul action figure if she sits with us every day. By the way, your mom hired me to babysit him after school, so I’d better go. Don’t want him to die on my watch.  
  
  You suck. Come home.  
  
  Bridge  
  
  P.S. Tomorrow they’re announcing section leaders in band. Wish me luck. If they give my spot to Kevin Quiggley, I’ll gouge out HIS eyes with Darth Maul.  
  
  Callipygian. Having shapely buttocks. Nice one, Bridge.  
  
  My best friend is a word fiend. One of her most prized possessions is her OED, which she bought for practically nothing at a yard sale two years ago. The Oxford English Dictionary is a twenty-volume set that not only provides definitions of words but their histories as well. Bridge is always throwing big words into conversations, because she loves to watch people squirm and bluff their way around them. I learned a long time ago not to pretend to know what she was talking about. She’d call me on it every time.  
  
  So Bridgette collects words and, apparently, my life.  
  
  I can’t believe Mom hired her to watch Sean. I know she’s the best choice, since we were always watching him together, but still. It’s weird she’s there without me. And it’s weird that she’s talking to my mom while I’m stuck here on the other side of the world. Next she’ll tell me she got a second job at the movie theater.  
  
  Speaking of, Toph hasn’t emailed me in two days. It’s not like I expected him to write every day‚ or even every week, but . . . there was an undeniable something between us. I mean, we kissed. Will this thing—whatever it is—end now that I’m here?  
  
  His real name is Christopher, but he hates being called Chris, so he goes by Toph instead. He has shocking green eyes and wicked sideburns.We’re both left-handed, we both love the fake nacho cheese at the concession stand, and we both hate Cuba Gooding Jr. I’ve crushed on Toph since my first day on the job, when he stuck his head under the ICEE machine and guzzled it straight from the tap to make me laugh. He had Blue Raspberry Mouth for the rest of his shift.  
  
  Not many people can pull off blue teeth. But believe me, Toph can.  
  
  I refresh my inbox—just in case—but nothing new appears. I’ve been planted in front of my computer for several hours, waiting for Bridge to get out of school. I’m glad she emailed me. For some reason, I wanted her to write first. Maybe because I wanted her to think I was so happy and busy that I didn’t have time to talk. When, in reality, I’m sad and alone.  
  
  And hungry. My mini-fridge is empty.  
  
  I had dinner in the cafeteria but avoided the main food line again, stuffing myself with more bread, which only lasts so long. Maybe St. Clair will order breakfast for me again in the morning. Or Meredith; I bet she’d do it.  
  
  I reply to Bridge, telling her about my new sort-of-friends, the crazy cafeteria with restaurant-quality food, and the giant Panthéon down the road. Despite myself, I describe St. Clair, and mention how in physics he leaned over Meredith to borrow a pen from me, right when Professeur Wakefield was assigning lab partners. So the teacher thought he was sitting next to me, and now St. Clair is my lab partner for the WHOLE YEAR.  
  
  Which was the best thing that happened all day.  
  
  I also tell Bridge about the mysterious Life class, La Vie, because she and I spent the entire summer speculating. (Me: “I bet we’ll debate the Big Bang and the Meaning of Life.” Bridge: “Dude, they’ll probably teach you breathing techniques and how to convert food into energy.”) All we did today was sit quietly and work on homework.  
  
  What a pity.  
  
  I spent the period reading the first novel assigned for English. And, wow. If I hadn’t realized I was in France yet, I do now. Because Like Water for Chocolate has sex in it. LOTS of sex. A woman’s desire literally lights a building on fire, and then a soldier throws her naked body onto a horse, and they totally do it while galloping away. There’s no way they would have let me read this back in the Bible Belt. The sexiest we ever got was The Scarlet Letter.  
  
  I must tell Bridge about this book.  
  
  It’s  
almost midnight when I finish the email, but the hallway is still noisy.The juniors and seniors have a lot of freedom because, supposedly, we’re mature enough to handle it. I am, but I have serious doubts as to my classmates.The guy across the hall already has a pyramid of beer bottles stacked outside his door because, in Paris, sixteen-year-olds are allowed to drink wine and beer. You have to be eighteen to get hard liquor.  
  
  Not that I haven’t seen that around here, too.  
  
  I wonder if my mother had any idea it’d be legal for me to get wasted when she agreed to this. She looked pretty surprised when they mentioned it at the Life Skills Seminars, and I got a long lecture on responsibility that night at dinner. But I don’t plan on getting drunk. I’ve always thought beer smells like urine.  
  
  There are a few part-timers who work the front desk, but only one live-in Résidence Director. His name is Nate, and his apartment is on the first floor. He’s in graduate school at some university around here. SOAP must pay him a lot to live with us.  
  
  Nate is in his twenties, and he’s short and pale and has a shaved head. Which sounds strange but is actually attractive. He’s soft-spoken and seems like the kind of guy who’d be a good listener, but his tone exudes responsibility and a don’t-mess-with-me attitude. My parents loved him. He also has a bowl of condoms next to his door.  
  
  I wonder if my parents saw that.  
  
  The freshmen and sophomores are in another dormitory. They have to share rooms, and their floors are divided by sex, and they have tons of supervision. They also have enforced curfews. We don’t.We just have to sign a log whenever we come and go at night so Nate knows we’re still alive.Yeah. I’m sure no one ever takes advantage of this high security.  
  
  I drag myself down the hall to use the bathroom. I take my place in line—there’s always a line, even at midnight—behind Amanda, the girl who attacked St. Clair at breakfast. She smirks at my faded jeans and my vintage Orange Crush T-shirt.  
  
  I didn’t know she lived on my floor. Super.  
  
  We don’t speak. I trace the floral pattern on the wallpaper with my fingers. Résidence Lambert is a peculiar mix of Parisian refinement and teenage practicality. Crystal light fixtures give the dormitory halls a golden glow, but fluorescent bulbs hum inside our bedrooms. The floors are glossy hardwood but lined with industrial-grade rugs. Fresh flowers and Tiffany lamps grace the lobby, but the chairs are ratty love seats, and the tables are carved with initials and rude words.  
  
  “So you’re the new Brandon,” Amanda says.  
  
  “Excuse me?”  
  
  “Brandon. Number twenty-five. He was expelled from school last year; one of the teachers found coke in his backpack.” She looks me over again and frowns. “Where are you from, anyway?” But I know what she’s really asking. She wants to know why they picked someone like me to take his place.  
  
  “Atlanta.”  
  
  “Oh,” she says. As if that explains my complete and utter hick-ness. Screw her. It’s one of the largest cities in America.  
  
  “So you and St. Clair seemed pretty friendly at breakfast.”  
  
  “Um.” Is she threatened by me?  
  
  “I wouldn’t get any ideas if I were you,” she continues. “Not even you’re pretty enough to steal him from his girlfriend.They’ve been together forever.”  
  
  Was that a compliment? Or not? Her emphasizing thing is really getting on my nerves. (My nerves.)  
  
  Amanda gives a fake, bored yawn. “Interesting hair.”  
  
  I touch it self-consciously. “Thanks. My friend bleached it.” Bridge added the thick band to my dark brown hair just last week. Normally, I keep the stripe tucked behind my right ear, but tonight it’s back in a ponytail.  
  
  “Do you like it?” she asks. Universal bitch-speak for I think it’s hideous.  
  
  I drop my hand. “Yeah. That’s why I did it.”  
  
  “You know, I wouldn’t pull it back like [that.You](http://that.You) kinda look like a skunk.”  
  
  “At least she doesn’t reek like one.” Rashmi appears behind me. She’d been visiting Meredith; I’d heard their muffled voices through my walls. “Delightful perfume, Amanda. Use a little more next time. I don’t know if they can smell you in London.”  
  
  Amanda snarls. “Nice glasses.”  
  
  “Good one,” Rashmi deadpans, but I notice she adjusts them anyway. Her nails are electric blue, the same shade as her frames. She turns to me. “I live two floors up, room six-o-one, if you need anything. See you at breakfast.”  
  
  So she doesn’t dislike me! Or maybe she just hates Amanda more. Either way, I’m thankful, and I call goodbye to her retreating figure. She waves a hand and moves into the stairwell as Nate comes out of it. He approaches us in his quiet, friendly manner.  
  
  “Going to bed soon, ladies?”  
  
  Amanda smiles sweetly. “Of course.”  
  
  “Great. Did you have a nice first day, Anna?”  
  
  It’s so peculiar how everyone here already knows my name. “Yeah. Thanks, Nate.”  
  
  He nods as if I’ve said something worth thinking about, and then says good night and moves on to the guys hanging out at the other end of the hallway.  
  
  “I hate it when he does that,” Amanda says.  
  
  “Does what?”  
  
  “Check up on us. What an asshole.” The bathroom door opens, and a tiny redhead maneuvers around Amanda, who just stands there like she’s Queen of the Threshold. The girl must be a junior. I don’t recognize her from the circle of desks in senior English. “God, did you fall in?” Amanda asks. The girl’s pale skin turns pink.  
  
  “She was just using the restroom,” I say.  
  
  Amanda sashays onto the tile, her fuzzy purple slippers slapping against her heels. She yanks the door shut. “Does it look like I care? Skunk Girl?”  
  
  chapter six  
  
  One week into school, and I’m knee-deep in Fancy International Education.  
  
  Professeur Cole’s syllabus is free of the usual Shakespeare and Steinbeck, and instead, we’re focusing on translated works. Every morning she hosts the discussion of Like Water for Chocolate as if we were a book club and not some boring, required class.  
  
  So English is excellent.  
  
  On the other hand, my French teacher is clearly illiterate. How else to explain the fact that despite the name of our textbook—Level One French—Professeur Gillet insists on speaking in French only? She also calls on me a dozen times a day. I never know the answer.  
  
  Dave calls her Madame Guillotine. This is also excellent.  
  
  He’s taken the class before, which is helpful but obviously not really helpful, as he failed it the first go-round. Dave has shaggy hair and pouty lips, and the peculiar combination of tan skin and freckles. Several girls have a crush on him. He’s also in my history class. I’m with the juniors, because the seniors take government, and I’ve already studied it. So I sit between Dave and Josh.  
  
  Josh is quiet and reserved in class, but outside of it, his sense of humor is similar to St. Clair’s. It’s easy to understand why they’re such good friends. Meredith says they idolize each other, Josh because of St. Clair’s innate charisma, and St. Clair because Josh is an astounding artist. I rarely see Josh without his brush pen or sketchbook. His work is incredible—thick bold strokes and teeny exquisite details—and his fingers are always stained with ink.  
  
  But the most notable aspect of my new education is the one that takes place outside of class.The one never mentioned in the glossy brochures. And that is this: attending boarding school is like living inside a high school. I can’t get away. Even when I’m in my bedroom, my ears are blasted by pop music, fistfights over washing machines, and drunk dancing in the stairwell. Meredith claims it’ll settle down once the novelty wears off for the juniors, but I’m not holding my breath.  
  
  However.  
  
  It’s Friday night, and Résidence Lambert has cleared out. My classmates are hitting the bars, and I have peace for the first time. If I close my eyes, I can almost believe I’m back home. Except for the opera. The Opera Diva sings most evenings at the restaurant across the street. For someone with such a huge v  
oice, she’s surprisingly small. She’s also one of those people who shaves her eyebrows and draws them back on with a pencil. She looks like an extra from The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  
  
  Bridge calls as I’m watching Rushmore from the comfort of my mini-bed. It’s the film that launched Wes Anderson. Wes is amazing, a true auteur involved in every aspect of production, with a trademark style recognizable in any frame—wistful and quirky, deadpan and dark. Rushmore is one of my favorites. It’s about a guy named Max Fischer who is obsessed with, among many things, the private school that kicked him out.What would my life be like if I were as passionate about SOAP as Max is about Rushmore Academy? For starters, I probably wouldn’t be alone in my bedroom covered in white pimple cream.  
  
  “Annnnn-uhhhhhh,” Bridge says. “I haaaaate themmmm.”  
  
  She didn’t get section leader in band.Which is lame, because everyone knows she’s the most talented drummer in school. The percussion instructor gave it to Kevin Quiggley, because he thought the guys on the drumline wouldn’t respect Bridge as a leader—because she’s a girl.  
  
  Yeah, well, now they won’t. Jerk.  
  
  So Bridge hates band and hates the instructor and hates Kevin, who is a twerp with a disproportionately large ego. “Just wait,” I say. “Soon you’ll be the next MegWhite or Sheila E., and Kevin Quiggley will brag about how he knew you back when. And then when he approaches you after some big show, expecting special treatment and a backstage pass? You can sashay right past him without so much as a backward glance.”  
  
  I hear the weary smile in her voice. “Why’d you move away again, Banana?”  
  
  “Because my father is made of suck.”  
  
  “The purest strain, dude.”  
  
  We talk until three a.m., so I don’t wake up until early afternoon. I scramble to get dressed before the cafeteria closes. It’s only open for brunch on Saturdays and Sundays. It’s quiet when I arrive, but Rashmi and Josh and St. Clair are seated at their usual table.

1la5irf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/1la5irf/maplestory_withdrawal_syndrome/,Maplestory Withdrawal Syndrome,"Maplestory Withdrawal Syndrome (ICD-X: Digital Dopaminergic Depletion Disorder)

ICD-10 Code: F63.89 — Behavioral addiction, digital gaming-related, specified

1. **Definition**: A neurobehavioral syndrome resulting from abrupt cessation of chronic MapleStory exposure, particularly in individuals previously engaged in endgame bossing, grandis symbol dailies, or prolonged WAPing. Characterized by dopaminergic dysregulation, virtual limbic detachment, and maladaptive real-world coping attempts.
2. **Pathophysiology**:

a. Chronic overstimulation of the mesolimbic reward pathway via mesos, frags, and cubing leads to dopaminergic receptor downregulation.

b. Abrupt cessation results in dopamine deficiency, manifesting as motivational collapse and executive dysfunction.

c. Associated with parasocial detachment (e.g., from VHilla \[dommy mommy\], Cygnus, and Lucid).

3. **Clinical representation**:

a. *Phase I - Crash (0-48 hours)*

1) Psychomotor retardation- Sudden loss of keyboard reflexes, inability to press ""Y"" instinctively.

2) Hypersomnia- Excessive sleeping due to lack of urgent weekly boss resets and WAPing.

3) Hyperphagia- Compensatory overeating of real-life food (esp. junk) in absence of MVP buff timers.

b. *Phase II - Acute Withdrawal (2-7 days)*

*1)* Anhedonia- Inability to experience pleasure from normal stimuli (e.g., human interaction, sunlight).

2) Affective flattening- Inexpressive face due to absence of chair flexing in Monster Park.

3) Severe irritability- Especially when reminded ""it's just a game.""

4) Cravings- Compulsive urge to log in “just to do dailies real quick.”

5) Vivid dreams- Often involve failed 21-SF PB enhancement or failing a Grindstone.

c. *Phase III - Protracted Withdrawal (Weeks+)*

1) Existential confusion- Wondering what to do with hands and life at 10 PM.

2) Auditory hallucinations- Phantom sounds of Carcion music or Cubing SFX.

3) Depersonalization: Feeling like a pre-grandis-bossing scrub in the real world.

4. **Management**:

a. Supportive care: Structured schedules, social re-integration, and exposure to non-pixelated nature.

b. Pharmacologic interventions: None FDA-approved. Experimental use of dopamine agonists (e.g., exercise, coffee, actual social bonding, Cocaine).

c. Relapse prevention: Avoid re-installing Nexon Launcher “just to check cash shop.” This includes ""Steam"" too.

5. **Prognosis**:

a. Most cases resolve with time, peer support, and realization that doing all dailies on 6 champions is not sustainable.

b. However, re-exposure (e.g., Summer/Winter update, Challenger World, or boss rework) carries high risk of relapse.",3,1749783790.0,Maplestory,1,0.67,False

The first date was a overall good experience. but it ended with a bad kiss. He laughed and said you arevnot the best kisser. which has caused me to be a little self-conscious about kissing other people. we had another date now comes forward Halloween. we decide to go trick-or-treating together with his friends. His ex Gf (Q) kept messaging him throughout the night. which caused him to stop paying attention to me and others around him. I told him it felt like he wasn’t interested. I was feeling a little insecure because I know (Q) is a lot skinny than me when i am a bigger girl. We broke it off after we were done trick-or-treating. 
We decided to be friends and then he continued to flirt with me and I told him I felt like he was playing with my emotions so I decided to block him on everything. After we broke it off (Q) message me. Something along the line of this “please be careful with him. And take your time with liam because of his ocd n shit.” A couple months passed by. I’m starting to talk to another guy which quickly ends soon. I unblocked liam. A week after he messaged me. We start talking and decided to get coffee together.  We get coffee and decided to try again. But then he start being self pity and saying he going to hurt me again. I argued that it was my decision to start this again. But it didnt make liam agree so we broke it off again. A week after we were both we hung out again.  We had a really meaningful conversation about everything. We made out in my truck. I felt pretty good after that like we are getting on the right track after everything. But once again the circle repeats itself he does self pity thing. I block him. Over a month i unblock him.

We stopped because i was very emotional invested. We talked as friends but i was short n dry. He followed my ex gf (P). He told he was thinking of message her i told him i was uncomfortable with that. We argued over this. I said if i messaged (Q) how he would feel. He said i would be mad and jealous. I was like okay then you see my point. We drifted apart but he starts messaging occasionally i was short n dry again. Until one night he calls me very upset. He explains that he was messaging (P). And that P was best friends with his ex (Q) and  she told liam that (Q) cheated on him. But i was blind with rage and yelled at him for going behind my back and messaging p. He yells at me saying that he just found out that the LOVE OF HIS LIFE was cheating on. I just hung up n blocked him. That was a month ago but a couple days i had a really bad sexual experience with a guy. I need to just talk to him. I unblock him and call him. I was crying n upset. He calms me down. We been speaking again. I just don’t know what to do with him. It seems like i cant keep him block. It like i am tied with him somehow. I really do like him and dream of a relationship with him.

 I just started to be really careful about avoiding seed oils 2 days ago (although I had mostly cooked at home in ghee/olive oil for the last 3 years, eating out about 30% of the time which would probably mean seed oil exposure or getting a matcha made with oat milk at a coffee shop which usually has seed oils)

And I would.....","**Chapter one**  
  Here is everything I know about France: Madeline and Amélie and Moulin Rouge. The Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe, although I have no idea what the function of either actually is. Napoleon, Marie Antoinette, and a lot of kings named Louis. I’m not sure what they did either, but I think it has something to do with the French Revolution, which has something to do with Bastille Day. The art museum is called the Louvre and it’s shaped like a pyramid and the Mona Lisa lives there along with that statue of the woman missing her arms. And there are cafés or bistros or whatever they call them on every street corner. And mimes. The food is supposed to be good, and the people drink a lot of wine and smoke a lot of cigarettes.  I’ve heard they don’t like Americans, and they don’t like white sneakers.  A few months ago, my father enrolled me in boarding school. His air quotes practically crackled over the phone line as he declared living abroad to be a “good learning experience” and a “keepsake I’d treasure forever.” Yeah. Keepsake. And I would’ve pointed out his misuse of the word had I not already been freaking out.  Since his announcement, I’ve tried yelling, begging, pleading, and crying, but nothing has convinced him otherwise. And now I have a new student visa and a passport, each declaring me: Anna Oliphant, citizen of the United States of America. And now I’m here with my parents—unpacking my belongings in a room smaller than my suitcase—the newest senior at the School of America in Paris.  It’s not that I’m ungrateful. I mean, it’s Paris. The City of Light! The most romantic city in the world! I’m not immune to that. It’s just this whole international boarding school thing is a lot more about my father than it is about me. Ever since he sold out and started writing lame books that were turned into even lamer movies, he’s been trying to impress his big-shot New York friends with how cultured and rich he is.  
  My father isn’t cultured. But he is rich.  It wasn’t always like this.When my parents were still married, we were strictly lower middle class. It was around the time of the divorce that all traces of decency vanished, and his dream of being the next great Southern writer was replaced by his desire to be the next published writer. So he started writing these novels set in Small Town Georgia about folks with Good American Values who Fall in Love and then contract Life-Threatening Diseases and Die.  
  I’m serious.  And it totally depresses me, but the ladies eat it up.They love my father’s books and they love his cable-knit sweaters and they love his bleachy smile and orangey tan. And they have turned him into a bestseller and a total dick.  Two of his books have been made into movies and three more are in production, which is where his real money comes from. Hollywood. And, somehow, this extra cash and pseudo-prestige have warped his brain into thinking that I should live in France. For a year. Alone. I don’t understand why he couldn’t send me to Australia or Ireland or anywhere else where English is the native language. The only French word I know is oui, which means “yes,” and only recently did I learn it’s spelled o-u-i and not w-e-e.  
  
  At least the people in my new school speak English. It was founded for pretentious Americans who don’t like the company of their own children. I mean, really. Who sends their kid to boarding school? It’s so Hogwarts. Only mine doesn’t have cute boy wizards or magic candy or flying lessons.  
  
  Instead, I’m stuck with ninety-nine other students. There are twenty-five people in my entire senior class, as opposed to the six hundred I had back in Atlanta. And I’m studying the same things I studied at Clairemont High except now I’m registered in beginning French.  Oh, yeah. Beginning French. No doubt with the freshmen. I totally rock.  Mom says I need to lose the bitter factor, pronto, but she’s not the one leaving behind her fabulous best friend, Bridgette. Or her fabulous job at the Royal Midtown 14 multiplex. Or Toph, the fabulous boy at the Royal Midtown 14 multiplex.  And I still can’t believe she’s separating me from my brother, Sean, who is only seven and way too young to be left home alone after school. Without me, he’ll probably be kidnapped by that creepy guy down the road who has dirty Coca-Cola towels hanging in his windows. Or Seany will accidentally eat something containing Red Dye #40 and his throat will swell up and no one will be there to drive him to the hospital. He might even die. And I bet they wouldn’t let me fly home for his funeral and I’d have to visit the cemetery alone next year and Dad will have picked out some god-awful granite cherub to go over his grave.  And I hope Dad doesn’t expect me to fill out college applications to Russia or Romania now. My dream is to study film theory in California. I want to be our nation’s greatest female film critic. Someday I’ll be invited to every festival, and I’ll have a major newspaper column and a cool television show and a ridiculously popular website. So far I only have the website, and it’s not so popular.Yet.  
  I just need a little more time to work on it, that’s all.  
  
  “Anna, it’s time.”  
  
  “What?” I glance up from folding my shirts into perfect squares.  
  
  Mom stares at me and twiddles the turtle charm on her necklace. My father, bedecked in a peach polo shirt and white boating shoes, is gazing out my dormitory window. It’s late, but across the street a woman belts out something operatic.  
  
  My parents need to return to their hotel rooms. They both have early morning flights.  
  
  “Oh.” I grip the shirt in my hands a little tighter.  
  
  Dad steps away from the window, and I’m alarmed to discover his eyes are wet. Something about the idea of my father—even if it is my father—on the brink of tears raises a lump in my throat.  
  
  “Well, kiddo. Guess you’re all grown up now.”  
  
  My body is frozen. He pulls my stiff limbs into a bear hug. His grip is frightening. “Take care of yourself. Study hard and make some friends. And watch out for pickpockets,” he adds. “Sometimes they work in pairs.”  
  
  I nod into his shoulder, and he releases me. And then he’s gone.  
  
  My mother lingers behind. “You’ll have a wonderful year here,” she says. “I just know it.” I bite my lip to keep it from quivering, and she sweeps me into her arms. I try to breathe. Inhale. Count to three. Exhale. Her skin smells like grapefruit body lotion. “I’ll call you the moment I get home,” she says.  
  
  Home. Atlanta isn’t my home anymore.  
  
  “I love you, Anna.”  
  
  I’m crying now. “I love you, too. Take care of Seany for me.”  
  
  “Of course.”  
  
  “And Captain Jack,” I say. “Make sure Sean feeds him and changes his bedding and fills his water bottle. And make sure he doesn’t give him too many treats because they make him fat and then he can’t get out of his igloo. But make sure he gives him at least a few every day, because he still needs the vitamin C and he won’t drink the water when I use those vitamin drops—”  
  
  She pulls back and tucks my bleached stripe behind my ear. “I love you,” she says again.  
  
  And then my mother does something that, even after all of the paperwork and plane tickets and presentations, I don’t see coming. Something that would’ve happened in a year anyway, once I left for college, but that no matter how many days or months or years I’ve yearned for it, I am still not prepared for when it actually happens.  
  
  My mother leaves. I am alone.  
  
  chapter two  
  
  I feel it coming, but I can’t stop it.  
  
  PANIC.  
  
  They left me. My parents actually left me! IN FRANCE!  
  
  Meanwhile, Paris is oddly silent. Even the opera singer has packed it in for the night. I cannot lose it. The walls here are thinner than Band-Aids, so if I break down, my neighbors—my new classmates—will hear everything. I’m going to be sick. I’m going to vomit that weird eggplant tapenade I had for dinner, and everyone will hear, and no one will invite me to watch the mimes escape from their invisible boxes, or whatever it is people do here in their spare time.  
  
  I race to my pedestal sink to splash water on my face, but it explodes out and sprays my shirt instead. And now I’m crying harder, because I haven’t unpacked my towels, and wet clothing reminds me of those stupid water rides Bridgette and Matt used to drag me on at Six Flags where the water is the wrong color and it smells like paint and it has a billion trillion bacterial microbes in it. Oh God. What if there are bacterial microbes in the water? Is French water even safe to drink?  
  
  Pathetic. I’m pathetic.  
  
  How many seventeen-year-olds would kill to leave home? My neighbors aren’t experiencing any meltdowns. No crying coming from behind their bedroom walls. I grab a shirt off the bed to blot myself dry, when the solution strikes. My pillow. I collapse face-first into the sound barrier and sob and sob and sob.  
  
  Someone is knocking on my door.  
  
  No. Surely that’s not my door.  
  
  There it is again!  
  
  “Hello?” a girl calls from the hallway. “Hello? Are you okay?”  
  
  No, I’m not okay. GO AWAY. But she calls again, and I’m obligated to crawl off my bed and answer the door. A blonde with long, tight curls waits on the other side. She’s tall and big, but not overweight-big.Volleyball player big. A diamondlike nose ring sparkles in the hall light. “Are you all right?” Her voice is gentle. “I’m Meredith; I live next door. Were those your parents who just left?”  
  
  My puffy eyes signal the affirmative.  
  
  “I cried the first night, too.” She tilts her head, thinks for a moment, and then nods. “Come on. Chocolat chaud.”  
  
  “A chocolate show?” Why would I want to see a chocolate show? My mother has abandoned me and I’m terrified to leave my room and—  
  
  “No.” She smiles. “Chaud. Hot. Hot chocolate, I can make some in my room.”  
  
  Oh.  
  
  Despite myself, I follow. Meredith stops me with her hand like a crossing guard. She’s wearing rings on all five fingers. “Don’t forget your key. The doors automatically lock behind you.”  
  
  “I know.” And I tug the necklace out from underneath my shirt to prove it. I slipped my key onto it during this weekend’s required Life Skills Seminars for new students, when they told us how easy it is to get locked out.  
  
  We enter her room. I gasp. It’s the same impossible size as mine, seven by ten feet, with the same mini-desk, mini-dresser, mini-bed, mini-fridge, mini-sink, and mini-shower. (No mini-toilet, those are shared down the hall.) But . . . unlike my own sterile cage, every inch of wall and ceiling is covered with posters and pictures and shiny wrapping paper and brightly colored flyers written in French.  
  
  “How long have you been here?” I ask.  
  
  Meredith hands me a tissue and I blow my nose, a terrible honk like an angry goose, but she doesn’t flinch or make a face. “I arrived yesterday. This is my fourth year here, so I didn’t have to go to the seminars. I flew in alone, so I’ve just been hanging out, waiting for my friends to show up.” She looks around with her hands on her hips, admiring her handiwork. I spot a pile of magazines, scissors, and tape on her floor and realize it’s a work in progress. “Not bad, eh? White walls don’t do it for me.”  
  
  I circle her room, examining everything. I quickly discover that most of the faces are the same five people: John, Paul, George, Ringo, and some soccer guy I don’t recognize.  
  
  “The Beatles are all I listen to. My friends tease me, but—”  
  
  “Who’s this?” I point to Soccer Guy. He’s wearing red and white, and he’s all dark eyebrows and dark hair. Quite good-looking, actually.  
  
  “Cesc Fàbregas. God, he’s the most incredible passer. Plays for Arsenal. The English football club? No?”  
  
  I shake my head. I don’t keep up with sports, but maybe I should. “Nice legs, though.”  
  
  “I know, right? You could hammer nails with those thighs.”  
  
  While Meredith brews chocolat chaud on her hot plate, I learn she’s also a senior, and that she only plays soccer during the sum  
mer because our school doesn’t have a program, but that she used to rank All-State in Massachusetts. That’s where she’s from, Boston. And she reminds me I should call it “football” here, which—when I think about it—really does make more sense. And she doesn’t seem to mind when I badger her with questions or paw through her things.  
  
  Her room is amazing. In addition to the paraphernalia taped to her walls, she has a dozen china teacups filled with plastic glitter rings, and silver rings with amber stones, and glass rings with pressed flowers. It already looks as if she’s lived here for years.  
  
  I try on a ring with a rubber dinosaur attached. The T-rex flashes red and yellow and blue lights when I squeeze him. “I wish I could have a room like this.” I love it, but I’m too much of a neat freak to have something like it for myself. I need clean walls and a clean desktop and everything put away in its right place at all times.  
  
  Meredith looks pleased with the compliment.  
  
  “Are these your friends?” I place the dinosaur back into its teacup and point to a picture tucked in her mirror. It’s gray and shadowy and printed on thick, glossy paper. Clearly the product of a school photography class. Four people stand before a giant hollow cube, and the abundance of stylish black clothing and deliberately mussed hair reveals Meredith belongs to the resident art clique. For some reason, I’m surprised. I know her room is artsy, and she has all of those rings on her fingers and in her nose, but the rest is clean-cut—lilac sweater, pressed jeans, soft voice. Then there’s the soccer thing, but she’s not a tomboy either.  
  
  She breaks into a wide smile, and her nose ring winks. “Yeah. Ellie took that at La Défense. That’s Josh and St. Clair and me and Rashmi. You’ll meet them tomorrow at breakfast. Well, everyone but Ellie. She graduated last year.”  
  
  The pit of my stomach begins to unclench. Was that an invitation to sit with her?  
  
  “But I’m sure you’ll meet her soon enough, because she’s dating St. Clair. She’s at Parsons Paris now for photography.  I’ve never heard of it, but I nod as if I’ve considered going there myself someday.  
  
  “She’s really talented.” The edge in her voice suggests otherwise, but I don’t push it. “Josh and Rashmi are dating, too,” she adds.  
  
  Ah. Meredith must be single.  
  
  Unfortunately, I can relate. Back home I’d dated my friend Matt for five months. He was tall-ish and funny-ish and had decent-ish hair. It was one of those “since no one better is around, do you wanna make out?” situations. All we’d ever done was kiss, and it wasn’t even that great.Too much spit. I always had to wipe off my chin.  
  
  We broke up when I learned about France, but it wasn’t a big deal. I didn’t cry or send him weepy emails or key his mom’s station wagon. Now he’s going out with Cherrie Milliken, who is in chorus and has shiny shampoo-commercial hair. It doesn’t even bother me.  
  
  Not really.  
  
  Besides, the breakup freed me to lust after Toph, multiplex coworker babe extraordinaire. Not that I didn’t lust after him when I was with Matt, but still. It did make me feel guilty. And things were starting to happen with Toph—they really were—when summer ended. But Matt’s the only guy I’ve ever gone out with, and he barely counts. I once told him I’d dated this guy named Stuart Thistleback at summer camp. Stuart Thistleback had auburn hair and played the stand-up bass, and we were totally in love, but he lived in Chattanooga and we didn’t have our driver’s licenses yet.  
  
  Matt knew I made it up, but he was too nice to say so.  
  
  I’m about to ask Meredith what classes she’s taking, when her phone chirps the first few bars of “Strawberry Fields Forever.” She rolls her eyes and answers. “Mom, it’s midnight here. Six-hour time difference, remember?”  
  
  I glance at her alarm clock, shaped like a yellow submarine, and I’m surprised to find she’s right. I set my long-empty mug of chocolat chaud on her dresser. “I should get going,” I whisper. “Sorry I stayed so long.”  
  
  “Hold on a sec.” Meredith covers the mouthpiece. “It was nice meeting you. See you at breakfast?”  
  
  “Yeah. See ya.” I try to say this casually, but I’m so thrilled that I skip from her room and promptly slam into a wall.  
  
  Whoops. Not a wall. A boy.  
  
  “Oof.” He staggers backward.  
  
  “Sorry! I’m so sorry, I didn’t know you were there.”  
  
  He shakes his head, a little dazed.The first thing I notice is his hair—it’s the first thing I notice about everyone. It’s dark brown and messy and somehow both long and short at the same time. I think of the Beatles, since I’ve just seen them in Meredith’s room. It’s artist hair. Musician hair. I-pretend-I-don’t-care-but-I-really-do hair.  
  
  Beautiful hair.  
  
  “It’s okay, I didn’t see you either. Are you all right, then?”  
  
  Oh my. He’s English.  
  
  “Er. Does Mer live here?”  
  
  Seriously, I don’t know any American girl who can resist an English accent.  
  
  The boy clears his throat. “Meredith Chevalier? Tall girl? Big, curly hair?” Then he looks at me like I’m crazy or half deaf, like my Nanna Oliphant. Nanna just smiles and shakes her head whenever I ask, “What kind of salad dressing would you like?” or “Where did you put Granddad’s false teeth?”  
  
  “I’m sorry.” He takes the smallest step away from me. “You were going to bed.”  
  
  “Yes! Meredith lives there. I’ve just spent two hours with her.” I announce this proudly like my brother, Seany, whenever he finds something disgusting in the yard. “I’m Anna! I’m new here!” Oh God. What. Is with.The scary enthusiasm? My cheeks catch fire, and it’s all so humiliating.  
  
  The beautiful boy gives an amused grin. His teeth are lovely—straight on top and crooked on the bottom, with a touch of overbite. I’m a sucker for smiles like this, due to my own lack of orthodontia. I have a gap between my front teeth the size of a raisin.  
  
  “Étienne,” he says. “I live one floor up.”  
  
  “I live here.” I point dumbly at my room while my mind whirs: French name, English accent, American school. Anna confused.  
  
  He raps twice on Meredith’s door. “Well. I’ll see you around then, Anna.”  
  
  Eh-t-yen says my name like this: Ah-na.  
  
  My heart thump thump thumps in my chest.  
  
  Meredith opens her door. “St. Clair!” she shrieks. She’s still on the phone. They laugh and hug and talk over each other. “Come in! How was your flight? When’d you get here? Have you seen Josh? Mom, I’ve gotta go.”  
  
  Meredith’s phone and door snap shut simultaneously.  
  
  I fumble with the key on my necklace. Two girls in matching pink bathrobes strut behind me, giggling and gossiping. A crowd of guys across the hall snicker and catcall. Meredith and her friend laugh through the thin walls. My heart sinks, and my stomach tightens back up.  
  
  I’m still the new girl. I’m still alone.  
  
  chapter three  
  
  The next morning, I consider stopping by Meredith’s, but I chicken out and walk to breakfast by myself. At least I know where the cafeteria is (Day Two: Life Skills Seminars). I double-check for my meal card and pop open my Hello Kitty umbrella. It’s drizzling. The weather doesn’t give a crap that it’s my first day of school.  
  
  I cross the road with a group of chattering students.They don’t notice me, but together we dodge the puddles. An automobile, small enough to be one of my brother’s toys, whizzes past and sprays a girl in glasses. She swears, and her friends tease her.  
  
  I drop behind.  
  
  The city is pearl gray.The overcast sky and the stone buildings emit the same cold elegance, but ahead of me, the Panthéon shimmers. Its massive dome and impressive columns rise up to crown the top of the neighborhood. Every time I see it, it’s difficult to pull away. It’s as if it were stolen from ancient Rome or, at the very least, Capitol Hill. Nothing I should be able to view from a classroom window.  
  
  I don’t know its purpose, but I assume someone will tell me soon.  
  
  My new neighborhood is the Latin Quarter, or the fifth arrondissement. According to my pocket dictionary, that means district, and the buildings in my arrondissement blend one into another, curving around corners with the sumptuousness of wedding cakes.The sidewalks are crowded with students and tourists, and they’re lined with identical benches and ornate lampposts, bushy trees ringed in metal grates, Gothic cathedrals and tiny crêperies, postcard racks, and curlicue wrought iron balconies.  
  
  If this were a vacation, I’m sure I’d be charmed. I’d buy an Eiffel Tower key chain, take pictures of the cobblestones, and order a platter of escargot. But I’m not on vacation. I am here to live, and I feel small.  
  
  The School of America’s main building is only a two-minute walk from Résidence Lambert, the junior and senior dormitory. The entrance is through a grand archway, set back in a courtyard with manicured trees. Geraniums and ivy trail down from window boxes on each floor, and majestic lion’s heads are carved into the center of the dark green doors, which are three times my height. On either side of the doors hangs a red, white, and blue flag—one American, the other French.  
  
  It looks like a film set. A Little Princess, if it took place in Paris. How can such a school really exist? And how is it possible that I’m enrolled? My father is insane to believe I belong here. I’m struggling to close my umbrella and nudge open one of the heavy wooden doors with my butt, when a preppy guy with faux-surfer hair barges past. He smacks into my umbrella and then shoots me the stink-eye as if: (1) it’s my fault he has the patience of a toddler and (2) he wasn’t already soaked from the rain.  
  
  Two-point deduction for Paris. Suck on that, Preppy Guy.  
  
  The ceiling on the first floor is impossibly high, dripping with chandeliers and frescoed with flirting nymphs and lusting satyrs. It smells faintly of orange cleaning products and dry-erase markers. I follow the squeak of rubber soles toward the cafeteria. Beneath our feet is a marbled mosaic of interlocking sparrows. Mounted on the wall, at the far end of the hall, is a gilded clock that’s chiming  
the hour.  
  
  The whole school is as intimidating as it is impressive. It should be reserved for students with personal bodyguards and Shetland ponies, not someone who buys the majority of her wardrobe at Target.  
  
  Even though I saw it on the school tour, the cafeteria stops me dead. I used to eat lunch in a converted gymnasium that reeked of bleach and jockstraps. It had long tables with preattached benches, and paper cups and plastic straws.The hairnetted ladies who ran the cash registers served frozen pizza and frozen fries and frozen nuggets, and the soda fountains and vending machines provided the rest of my so-called nourishment.  
  
  But this. This could be a restaurant.  
  
  Unlike the historic opulence of the hall, the cafeteria is sleek and modern. It’s packed with round birch tables and plants in hanging baskets. The walls are tangerine and lime, and there’s a dapper Frenchman in a white chef’s hat serving a variety of food that looks suspiciously fresh. There are several cases of bottled drinks, but instead of high-sugar, high-caf colas, they’re filled with juice and a dozen types of mineral water. There’s even a table set up for coffee. Coffee. I know some Starbucks-starved students at Clairemont who’d kill for in-school coffee.  
  
  The chairs are already filled with people gossiping with their friends over the shouting of the chefs and the clattering of the dishes (real china, not plastic). I stall in the doorway. Students brush past me, spiraling out in all directions. My chest squeezes. Should I find a table or should I find breakfast first? And how am I even supposed to order when the menu is in freaking French?  
  
  I’m startled when a voice calls out my name. Oh please oh please oh please . . .  
  
  A scan through the crowd reveals a five-ringed hand waving from across the room. Meredith points to an empty chair beside her, and I weave my way there, grateful and almost painfully relieved.  
  
  “I thought about knocking on your door so we could walk together, but I didn’t know if you were a late sleeper.” Meredith’s eyebrows pinch together with worry. “I’m sorry, I should have [knocked.You](http://knocked.You) look so lost.”  
  
  “Thanks for saving me a spot.” I set down my stuff and take a seat.There are two others at the table and, as promised the night before, they’re from the photograph on her mirror. I’m nervous again and readjust my backpack at my feet.  
  
  “This is Anna, the girl I was telling you about,” Meredith says.  
  
  A lanky guy with short hair and a long nose salutes me with his coffee cup. “Josh,” he says. “And Rashmi.” He nods to the girl next to him, who holds his other hand inside the front pocket of his hoodie. Rashmi has blue-framed glasses and thick black hair that hangs all the way down her back. She gives me only the barest of acknowledgments.  
  
  That’s okay. No big deal.  
  
  “Everyone’s here except for St. Clair.” Meredith cranes her neck around the cafeteria. “He’s usually running late.”  
  
  “Always,” Josh corrects. “Always running late.”  
  
  I clear my throat. “I think I met him last night. In the hallway.”  
  
  “Good hair and an English accent?” Meredith asks.  
  
  “Um.Yeah. I guess.” I try to keep my voice casual.  
  
  Josh smirks. “Everyone’s in luuurve with St. Clair.”  
  
  “Oh, shut up,” Meredith says.  
  
  “I’m not.” Rashmi looks at me for the first time, calculating whether or not I might fall in love with her own boyfriend.  
  
  He lets go of her hand and gives an exaggerated sigh. “Well, I am. I’m asking him to prom. This is our year, I just know it.”  
  
  “This school has a prom?” I ask.  
  
  “God no,” Rashmi says. “Yeah, [Josh.You](http://Josh.You) and St. Clair would look really cute in matching tuxes.”  
  
  “Tails.” The English accent makes Meredith and me jump in our seats. Hallway boy. Beautiful boy. His hair is damp from the rain. “I insist the tuxes have tails, or I’m giving your corsage to Steve Carver instead.”  
  
  “St. Clair!” Josh springs from his seat, and they give each other the classic two-thumps-on-the-back guy hug.  
  
  “No kiss? I’m crushed, mate.”  
  
  “Thought it might miff the ol’ ball and chain. She doesn’t know about us yet.”  
  
  “Whatever,” Rashmi says, but she’s smiling now. It’s a good look for her. She should utilize the corners of her mouth more often.  
  
  Beautiful Hallway Boy (Am I supposed to call him Étienne or St. Clair?) drops his bag and slides into the remaining seat between Rashmi and me. “Anna.” He’s surprised to see me, and I’m startled, too. He remembers me.  
  
  “Nice umbrella. Could’ve used that this morning.” He shakes a hand through his hair, and a drop lands on my bare arm. Words fail me. Unfortunately, my stomach speaks for itself. His eyes pop at the rumble, and I’m alarmed by how big and brown they are. As if he needed any further weapons against the female race.  
  
  Josh must be right. Every girl in school must be in love with him.  
  
  “Sounds terrible. You ought to feed that thing. Unless ...” He pretends to examine me, then comes in close with a whisper. “Unless you’re one of those girls who never eats. Can’t tolerate that, I’m afraid. Have to give you a lifetime table ban.”  
  
  I’m determined to speak rationally in his presence. “I’m not sure how to order.”  
  
  “Easy,” Josh says. “Stand in line. Tell them what you want. Accept delicious goodies. And then give them your meal card and two pints of blood.”  
  
  “I heard they raised it to three pints this year,” Rashmi says.  
  
  “Bone marrow,” Beautiful Hallway Boy says. “Or your left earlobe.”  
  
  “I meant the menu, thank you very much.” I gesture to the chalkboard above one of the chefs. An exquisite, cursive hand has written out the morning’s menu in pink and yellow and white. In French. “Not exactly my first language.”  
  
  “You don’t speak French?” Meredith asks.  
  
  “I’ve taken Spanish for three years. It’s not like I ever thought I’d be moving to Paris.”  
  
  “It’s okay,” Meredith says quickly. “A lot of people here don’t speak French.”  
  
  “But most of them do,” Josh adds.  
  
  “But most of them not very well.” Rashmi looks pointedly at him.  
  
  “You’ll learn the language of food first. The language of love.” Josh rubs his belly like a skinny Buddha. “Oeuf. Egg. Pomme. Apple. Lapin. Rabbit.”  
  
  “Not funny.” Rashmi punches him in the arm. “No wonder Isis bites you. Jerk.”  
  
  I glance at the chalkboard again. It’s still in French. “And, um, until then?”  
  
  “Right.” Beautiful Hallway Boy pushes back his chair. “Come along, then. I haven’t eaten either.” I can’t help but notice several girls gaping at him as we wind our way through the crowd. A blonde with a beaky nose and a teeny tank top coos as soon as we get in line. “Hey, St. Clair. How was your summer?”  
  
  “Hallo, Amanda. Fine.”  
  
  “Did you stay here, or did you go back to London?” She leans over her friend, a short girl with a severe ponytail, and positions herself for maximum cleavage exposure.  
  
  “I stayed with me mum in San Francisco. Did you have a good holiday?” He asks this politely, but I’m pleased to hear the indifference in his voice.  
  
  Amanda flips her hair, and suddenly she’s Cherrie Milliken. Cherrie loves to swish her hair and shake it out and twirl it around her fingers. Bridgette is convinced she spends her weekends standing before oscillating fans, pretending to be a supermodel, but I think she’s too busy soaking her locks in seaweed papaya mud wraps in that never-ending quest for perfect sheen.  
  
  “It was fabulous.” Flip, goes her hair. “I went to Greece for a month, then spent the rest of my summer in Manhattan. My father has an amazing penthouse that overlooks Central Park.”  
  
  Every sentence she says has a word that’s emphasized. I snort to keep from laughing, and Beautiful Hallway Boy gets a strange coughing fit.

I'll be making little houses, some farm fields, and a few other things. The whole diorama will be part of a coffee table I'm building, so it'll be pretty large. Anyways, onto the point. I'm also planning to make a few demons, like Mistress Centipede, out of regular Nendo mannequins. I was debating adding the Predator and Xenomorph to the diorama as otherworldly demons.

Let's set politics aside for a moment and dive into some economic thoughts. One of Trump's key goals is tackling inflation in the US, and he seems dissatisfied with Powell, who prioritizes adjusting interest rates based on inflation and employment data.

As a Chinese citizen, it's a starkly different situation here. Since the pandemic, prices have been dropping year after year, including salaries for some individuals and the real estates' listings. This trend has left me feeling increasingly uncertain based on recent experiences:

1. I recently purchased a shovel for just 0.1 USD, delivery included.
2. During the recent competition among major delivery companies, you could order coffee or bubble tea for as low as 0.2 USD or less. 

While promotions play a role in the aforementioned cases, it's becoming common to find items priced under 0.5 USD with free delivery. Clearly, China is currently grappling with deflation. The question is, which economic challenge—deflation in China or inflation in the US—is potentially more concerning in the **long term**?

What are your thoughts?

Brush your teeth? Wash your face. Make your coffee? Apply serum while it brews.

# 2. Keep your products visible and accessible

Out of sight, out of mind. Keep your skincare next to your toothbrush or coffee mug.

# 3. Use multi-tasking products

Bundles that include masks with collagen, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C help you get multiple benefits in one session.

# 4. Create a “skincare soundtrack”

Make a playlist or podcast that lasts the same length as your routine, it trains your brain to look forward to the process.

# 5. Track your progress with photos or journaling

Nothing builds a habit like seeing results. Try snapping a pic every Sunday night.

1la56p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/spooky_stories/comments/1la56p6/my_new_job/,My new Job,"When I started working the graveyard shift at the local convenience store, I was just looking for a paycheck. But they didn’t hand me a uniform first. They handed me a list of rules.

No one explained them. My manager just said:
“Follow these. Don’t ask questions. If you screw up, you’ll know why.”
He smiled like he was joking, but his eyes weren’t laughing.

Here’s the list. I keep a copy in my back pocket. If you're ever unlucky enough to cover a night shift here, you'll want to do the same.

Rule One: The Man in the Black Suit
If a man in a black suit enters at 1:34 AM, and you cannot make out his face—even if nothing is covering it—go into the back room and lock the door.

Don’t come out until you hear the doorbell chime again.

Don’t try to peek.
Don’t try to take a picture.
Just wait.

Rule Two: The Red Slurpee
If the Slurpee machine starts dispensing a dark red mixture, stop everything.

Hang an “Out of Order” sign on the entire machine—not just the red nozzle.

Get the red-labeled bucket from under the sink (marked “Red Slurpee”).

Cycle the machine into the bucket until it returns to a normal color.

Keep cycling for two full buckets afterward, just to be safe.

If anyone drinks the dark red Slurpee:

Offer them anything to keep them in the store.

Remain calm.

Use the black phone in the back room.

Dial 10711 followed by the store number (for example: 1072110798).

Say: ""Red Slurpee.""

Then follow every single instruction they give you.

Rule Three: Trash Time
Never take out the trash between 1:30 AM and 3:45 AM.
I tell the new hires 2 to 4 AM, just to be safe.

Rule Four: The CDC Guy
If someone from the CDC shows up with no paperwork, and it's not Sunday, tell him you don’t want the delivery.

It’s not milk.
It’s not donuts.
It’s not sandwiches.
It’s not safe.

Rule Five: The Little Girl
Sometimes a little girl shows up alone, usually quiet.

Let her pick what candy she wants.
Do not charge her.

There’s petty cash in the drawer under Register One.
Print a receipt, sign it, and place it in the box beside the cash.

Don’t tell the manager.
They already know.
They never talk about her during the day.

Rule Six: The Vault
Restock the walk-in beverage cooler whenever needed. But remember:

Items are never in the same place twice.

If you need to exit, only leave through the same door you entered.

If you exit a different door, go back in, then leave through the original entrance.

Never take anything with you if you used the wrong door.

Ignore any voices or people on the other side.

They are not customers.
They are not safe.

Rule Seven: The Emergency Outside
If someone runs in screaming for help and begs you to go outside with them:

Do not go.

Tell them you’ll call the police.
If they insist, go into the back and use the black phone again.

Dial 10712 plus your store number.

Say: ""Emergency Outside.""

Follow instructions.

When you hang up, do not return to the front of the store until the black phone rings.

Answer it. The voice will say a code phrase.

For this store, it’s:

“Breakfast Bite, Potato Split Top Bun.”

That’s your sign it’s safe again.
Don’t answer any other phones.

Rule Eight: The Coffee
7-Eleven always keeps coffee fresh.

Back when we had glass pots, it was every 15 minutes. Now it’s 3 hours max with the new system.

If you have the instant brewer:
Never let it run out of beans.

You don’t want to know what happens if it does.

Rule Nine: Pump 1
At exactly 3:33 AM, if a man comes in asking for $6.65 on Pump 1, and gives you a $100 bill:

Take it.

Place the change and signed receipt into the box under Register One.

This helps fund the little girl’s candy.

Don’t ask questions. Just do it.

Rule Ten: The Money
There’s a reason we’re picky about money handling.

If someone asks you to load a card over the phone, hang up.

If a customer tells you to keep a tip, you may keep it.

If someone leaves change and says nothing, print a receipt, sign it, and put it under Register Two.

If you find money that shouldn’t be there, and you haven’t had a customer in a while, put it in the Register Two box with a note:

Amount

Register time (not the wall clock)

The manager will handle it.

He always does.

That’s the list.
I’ve followed every rule.
Some of my coworkers didn’t.

They don’t work here anymore.

Hell… some of them probably aren’t anywhere anymore.

If you get the night shift, don’t screw around.
Don’t play hero.
Don’t test it.

Just follow the rules.

And whatever you do…

Don’t drink the red Slurpee.

I have been so constipated/gassy/sick/bloated over the last week I’ve been glued to the couch with terrible cramping. Turns out the coffee had milk in it and the lactose had lactase enzymes - something I am now sensitive to. 

But damn, was that coffee delicious. I’ve been essentially poisoning myself for the last week and SO miserable,m and crabby, completely relying on my husband to take care of our child and me, but my lizard pregnancy brain still wants that coffee. ",1,1749782078.0,BabyBumps,0,1.0,False

1la4wip,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakewood/comments/1la4wip/all_these_coffee_shops_but_no_vibes_rant/,All these coffee shops but no vibes. [rant],"Friends, neighbors, what are we doing here? The west side of Lakewood has so many coffee shops and somehow they're all bad. A girl just wants to work on her fanfics in a cute little coffee shop with a matcha and a pastry. Is that too much to ask? Here's the rundown:

* Propaganda
   * Honestly not bad for Lakewood but not cozy at all.
   * There simply HAS to be a better way to arrange the seating, they could fit twice the tables in there and make better use of their gorgeous windows. Maybe even booths?
   * Drinks are good at least and the staff is nice.
* Burning River Coffee
   * Nothing kills the vibe like a clumsy armchair. And also looking face-to-face with an 18 year old who vaped his brain into mush from across the store because this place is also a literal smoke shop.
   * Enough with the ""instagram pastries"". They're not good!
* Brewella's
   * So close to greatness but it's always slammed every time I've gone.
   * Cramped as heck (despite the fact that they could add double the tables.)
   * DARK! It's kind of okay in the winter nights but during the day they always have stuff blocking their big beautiful windows. The whole place feels more like a dive than a coffee shop.
* The Blue Cafe
   * The vibe here is downright SINISTER
   * Mismatched color temp lightbulbs, a weird black couch. BLUE NEON? And oppressively bright can lights in that weird back room. 
   * It's somehow too dark and too bright all at once.
* Goodkind
   * Perfect in nearly every way except they will kick you out for having a laptop on the weekend. If you want to sit and chat, it's a really good spot. If you want to study or plan a getaway with your girls or write Dramione fanfic, this is NOT THE PLACE. A real shame.
   * They allow laptops during weekdays but it's the same 10 people who park there for the entire day so good luck getting a seat.
   * Are they ever going to expand into that vacant storefront they're attached to?
   * Vegan options are good at least.
* Root
   * The baristas are mean.
   * Why is everything sticky?
   * I can't give them too much crap, they have a lot of local artists featured, a community pantry, and tons of seating. Unlike Goodkind, they care about the ARTS \[ho hum!\]
   * It's actually maybe the best spot in Lakewood if they weren't so frickin mean. Lots of characters come in and out if you like to people-watch.
* Starbucks
   * Someone tell me why the frickin Starbucks is better than most of the locally owned little coffee shops in town? That's not how it's supposed to be.
   * Baristas are all super nice despite having objectively the worst clientele.
   * What is going on with the seating in this place? Each table is a mile apart from the other. It feels so poorly utilized. 
   * SO MUCH LIGHT!
* Caffeine
   * They hate you and the drinks are bad.
   * Someone walked into H&M and said ""I wish they sold coffee here.""
   * Not a good seat in the entire place.
* La Mocha (Not west, but I go there sometimes)
   * I want to like this place but the seating is sub-par for trying to do any kind of focused work and it's always full of artificial light. Vibes are so off.
   * Not a huge fan of the sugary drinks, especially if I'm trying to lock in.
   * They do artist events though which we must stan.
* Roasted (Not west, but I go there sometimes)
   * Okay on this one, I have to admit, the vibes and coffee are good. It's just so far east from me, I don't usually go there
   * If Lakewood would ever actually commit to protected bike lanes on Madison, maybe I'd go more. \[grrr\]

TL;DR: There's no vibey coffee shops on the west side of Lakewood without some horrible fatal flaw. I feel like we can do better. We can learn about color temperature and feng shui. We can acknowledge the value in making spaces that feel welcoming and cozy. We can commit to making our establishments places people *want* to be, spaces that attract artists and friend groups and families. 

I may have indulged myself in roasting all of these coffee shops, but I think my criticism of them stands. There are so few third spaces that aren't bars in this city. With a little TLC \[and some better attitudes from *some of you*\], I think all of these places could become something great.

What do you think? What did I miss? Is the east side any better? I've been going to Rocky River tbh and it feels like I'm betraying my city :(",2,1749781849.0,lakewood,17,0.55,False

1la4vi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1la4vi5/i_went_to_a_hackathon_with_no_experience_and_no/,I Went To A Hackathon With NO experience and NO Friends.,"So I went to this hackathon solo, not really sure what to expect.

Why did I go? 

Because I was sitting there coding one day and the thought randomly popped into my head ""What if I went to a hackathon?"" One google later badaboom badabing.

 I thought it would be a massive hall with hundreds of sweaty programmers, and since the theme was data science and I'm relatively new to coding, I was pretty worried about whether I'd be useful at all. But I said fuck it, I'll just go alone and try to represent the frontend developer army.

Turns out it was way smaller - about 15 people total. We worked on solutions to Dublin-specific issues. My team tackled traffic problems and the city's over-reliance on cars, while other teams focused on things like the homelessness crisis. We were split into 3 teams total.

**Funny thing:** I actually showed up a day early by mistake because I misread the email. Classic.

The people there had really diverse skill sets, which was reassuring since I'm relatively new to coding. I was worried I wouldn't be able to keep up, but I learned that having thinkers and leaders on teams is just as important as having programmers. Even without tons of experience, there's definitely a place for you.

I was also expecting it to suck based on all the online horror stories about people going to hackathons alone and having terrible times. But honestly, I'm pretty extroverted and social, so going solo wasn't as scary as I thought it would be. Not sure how more introverted people would handle it, but for me it worked out fine.

# My Team Was... Interesting

One girl basically sat down, ignored the rest of us, developed her own app, then left before we presented. She seemed talented but was clearly just there for herself - maybe trying to advance her career, which is fair I guess.

Then there was me, who ended up sort of overseeing the whole project because everyone kept working independently without communicating. I had to sync everything together every couple hours.

The other 3 were data scientists and they were all lovely people. The hardest part was coming up with a creative solution - if I did it again, I'd definitely think of something better.

# Our Solution

We expanded on the Irish government's current idea about transport hubs where people can rent bikes, scooters, or e-cars. But instead of adding e-cars, we suggested focusing on getting people to actually use the bikes and scooters we already have, since our research showed people are just choosing not to use existing facilities.

The solo girl did develop a pretty cool app to visualize the best areas for transport hubs though.

# The Event Itself

Was supposed to be 9am to 9pm but really ended around 5pm, which I was slightly disappointed about since I wanted the full hackathon experience. In hindsight though, it was perfect for a first-timer.

They had snacks throughout (both healthy and sugary options), pizza after presentations, and a little awards show where every team got an award. There was even a professional photographer for LinkedIn posts and social media.

The workspace was really impressive - big, colorful, clean, with plenty of charging stations and presentation areas. I was genuinely surprised something like this was happening in Dublin, especially since I only found out about it by chance. There was a cute little award ceremony where every team got an award which was nice. In fact the whole event was very low stakes and non competitive. Just good vibes and co-operation. 

The solo dev girl who ditched us ended up coming back just in time to collect the trophy, take photos for linkedin, and leave. LOL

# What You'd Need for a Hackathon

* Open mind
* Good understanding of your own skills
* Creative thinking
* Laptop (tablet at worst)
* Water bottle
* Stretch well before/during/after - you'll be hunched over a desk for hours

One teammate brought a laptop raiser which seemed like a smart move. Coffee was provided so no need to bring caffeine.

Overall, really glad I went. Definitely planning to do more of these. 

I wrote this because this was probably one of the more valuable experiences on my dev journey so far and it’s likely to be valuable to you also if you’re anything like me. 

So if you’re on the fence like I was, don’t be. Most of the people there are just trying to connect and are likely good natured. As long as you’re not a complete weirdo you’ll probably have a good time.

1la4u5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentrelinkOz/comments/1la4u5c/centrelink_correctly_outsourced_income_support_to/,"Centrelink ""correctly"" outsourced income support to my partner — please help with the ""financial abuse"" police statement","Disclaimer: 

I have made this post long because certain others won't think through their reflexive responses. I have done this thinking for them! You're welcome.

Post:

I will make the bold assumption that the flood of replies I received to my previous posts on Centrelink's Partner Test alleging ""financial abuse"" were in good faith, had my best interests in heart and were not — banish the thought! — lazy moralising or punching down. That's what they want to discuss, so I'm creating this post for them.

Let's humour the idea that Centrelink was right to cut off my income, resulting in my obvious hardship, and that my partner's lack of ""dependent maintenance"" to me is financial abuse. I'm giving these people the chance to put their money where their mouth is.

Brief context:

I have a disability that doesn't allow me to work enough to support myself financially. (Yes, I have explored WFH options and bootstrapping, thank you!) My partner does not fund my life, despite Centrelink's obviously reasonable assumption that she must. She lives on a modest income. We've always kept finances separate. She works so hard in 12 hour shifts that sometimes, as soon as she gets home, she passes out in her bed with the light on. She also has her own financial obligations, which would make the financial sacrifice of funding me doubly onerous and probably immiserating. Let's assume she's entitled to a future that isn't bleak — it's only fair.

I can only imagine her (non?) resentment at busting herself at work while she hands over coffee money and other leisure money for me to enjoy myself with.

I assume these people worried about ""financial abuse"" would expect something more than mere survival and subsistence on a permanent basis for both of us — no classism or ableism involved!

Caveat:

It could be argued that a single-income couple isn't the norm in 2025 — even with one member earning significantly more. A cost of living crisis makes such a prospect frightening. An onerous financial obligation imposed on the earning member will stress test the couple and see if love really does conquer all. I would hazard a guess that many otherwise committed couples would fold under such pressure or are damaged significantly, possibly with the potential for abuse.

De facto might be considered a narrow and arbitrary category Centrelink imposes on us in order to create financial obligation. You could call the couple we are something else to recognise that we are otherwise committed but resent the financial obligation.

Having my financial autonomy taken away is fine, because I made the error of needing income support, apparently. So if I need to grovel for spending money for treats from my partner, this is only fair.

Lastly, the financial abuse would be removed if Centrelink changed its mind and decided to recognise me as single for the purpose of payment.

I love my partner and would not leave her willingly, except under duress, which Centrelink is imposing on me.

The police charge:

So it has been established that my partner is financially abusive, despite the above. I was without income for two months, resulting in enormous hardship. Even when I work to the full extent of my ability, I don't have nearly enough to be financially stable. The family support I have had to resort to has caused enormous stress to the family member helping out and is not sustainable. The financial precarity has pushed my mental health to the brink questioning what value my life has and why I should keep on going.

By not fulfilling her expected role, she is ""financially abusing"" me. Help me write the police statement and a brief for a subsequent court case. Make sure it's believable enough so that others won't laugh in my face.

""Officer, I am a financial pet of my partner, per Centrelink's decision for her to fund my life. She won't bust herself at work and gladly hand over coffee money for me. I can't work enough to provide for myself and expect her to accommodate my financial needs because 'love conquers all' and she is my true partner. She should make a massive sacrifice by accepting her role as my new income support — but she won't. This is abuse! I demand that you arrest her and throw her in prison. I mean, we even fold laundry together and she says she cares about me. This proves she is a liar and an abuser!

She has less rights than other people because she was born overseas. Please take that into account and be ruthless!""

Dear Neighbors, Artists, Business Owners, and Community Leaders,
I've recently moved to this town and have come to appreciate the quiet strength, history, and
potential in our community. As I walk downtown, I see the bones of a beautiful story that deserves to
be told-and shared.
We live in a place with rich roots, from its logging past to the small businesses working hard to grow
something meaningful here. And yet, many of our walls remain bare. There is little graffiti, little color,
and little visual representation of who we are-or who we're becoming.
But I believe we have artists here-brilliant ones-whose work is waiting to be seen. I've met a few
quietly practicing in studios, garages, and kitchens. I believe our walls could become canvases for
that creativity, giving life to our stories, attracting visitors, and supporting our local economy in the
process.
Here's the idea: Imagine a community-wide art competition, held in our coffee shops, restaurants,
and gathering spaces. Artists from across the region could submit work in categories like heritage,
youth, environment, identity, and imagination. Winners would be awarded the chance to paint a
mural on one of our town's blank downtown walls.
This wouldn't just be about art. It would be about pride. It would be about small business. It would be
about creating places where people want to gather, take photos, eat, explore, and return to. Every
mural would be a new reason to visit-and to stay.
I don't have a full plan or a formal position. I'm just someone who cares and had an idea. If you think

something like this is worth doing, I hope this letter finds its way into the right hands.
If you're an artist, business owner, teacher, parent, student, council member, or simply someone
who wants to help make this place more vibrant-reach out. Take this idea and make it your own.
Let's see what it becomes.

First, thank you.

Your belief in what we’re building, a better, more connected coffee experience, is what keeps us moving forward. Whether you’ve supported us since the original Spinn launch or recently joined by pre-ordering the Spinn 2, your trust and patience have meant everything to us.

We know it’s been quiet recently, and we want to acknowledge that. Our silence hasn’t been from neglect, but from navigating a particularly complex phase in Spinn’s journey. Rather than offer partial updates, we’ve been working behind the scenes on meaningful progress. Today, we want to share where things stand and where we’re headed.

Rest assured that Spinn is operating and we stand by our no questions asked refund policy. We have had a major shift in the support department, which has slowed things up temporarily, but we are getting things back up to speed and truly appreciate your patience during these adjustments.

Where We Are:
The journey to bring Spinn 2 to life has been longer than any of us hoped. We know many of you are eagerly waiting, and we want to assure you:
We are fully committed to fulfilling every pre-order and continuing to evolve the Spinn platform.
In recent months, we’ve faced several macroeconomic and industry-wide challenges. From rising material and manufacturing costs, to shifting trade conditions, these external pressures have added friction to our timeline, but not to our mission.
Spinn is still here, and we are still building. We’re adjusting plans and executing thoughtfully to ensure long-term sustainability, while also protecting the experience you’ve signed up for.

What We’re Doing:
To ensure we continue delivering value to our customers, we’ve taken a number of steps to optimize operations:
We’ve focused resources on core production and support functions.
We’re in the process of expanding operational partnerships to increase flexibility and output.
We’re continuing to strengthen our financial position to support scale-up and delivery planning.
None of this has been easy, but every decision is being made with the long-term health of Spinn and the satisfaction of our customers in mind.

What You Can Expect:
Here’s what we can commit to right now:
Spinn 2 is still in motion
Every machine pre-ordered remains in our delivery plan.
Support for Spinn V1 continues

1la4qht,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1la4qht/tomt_short_story_book_about_cats/,[tomt] Short story book about cats,"Cross posts in what’s this book

Ok, I tried last night about one of my two white whale books I can't find from my childhood and got the answer in literally less than 15 minutes. So, let's try the other.

This was in the early 90's, had to be prior to 95' or 96' for sure. Same time frame as the other book which turned out to have come out in 93'.

It was a collection of stories about cats.

There was one story I remember fairly well. Though I may have details wrong bc I did on the other one. There is a girl at all girls school. She only has one friend. She hates the main teacher who runs the school. The girl has the really nice corner room. She feeds this stray cat outside her window. She loves him. She has a radio she likes as well. Over the course of the story things start going missing including the radio and the cat. She knows it is the headmistress. She knows she hurt the cat. She gets into a huge fight with her and the headmistress is playing coy like she knows nothing of what she is speaking about.

The girl starts fully freaking out and she falls over the coffee table or something and skewers herself on a like spear or something. I don't know, she does accidentally. After her death we start to see the headmistress really did not have any idea about what she was upset about and is quite shaken up. The friend is also super upset. The headmistress wants to help her through this tough time and asks if there is anything she can do. The friend says she would like to move into the corner room in order to be closer to the memories of her friend.

Headmistress agrees so friend goes and starts packing. She stops crying when she gets to her room opens the closet and pulls out a radio, several other objects that were the friends, and a black trash bag with a dead cat in it. She is going to dispose of them and then move into the room she wanted.

It is the only story I remember at all.",1,1749781323.0,tipofmytongue,5,1.0,False
1la4pli,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1la4pli/aitah_for_cutting_off_my_friend_with_no/,AITAH for cutting off my friend with no conversation,"So I had this friend that I met while working at a coffee shop about 6 years ago, we became very close because our shifts were always together 

She always seemed sweet and genuine, there was only one time early in our friendship when I got a weird feeling about her, it was because I was having my breast done and she called me with her friend ( they are both Spanish) making weird comments about me getting my boobs done , then they both started speaking in Spanish knowing I couldn’t understand and laughing , it felt very fake and I knew they were talking shit about me , I didn’t talk to her for 2 months after that and then she reached out and apologized so I forgave her. 

Fast forward to two years ago, I started making really good money, like a lot of money. And everytime I would hang out with her all she would talk about was my money , she would NEVER put in money towards the bill , she’d always expect me to pay for her . And I did like an idiot. 

Anytime I needed a favor , she would want me to give her money, like if I needed a ride somewhere, which I thought was crazy because I am the type of friend who would help my friend out no matter what and expect nothing in return.

My last straw with her was because we went to 6 flags together and I offered to pay for her ticket if she would drive, she said yes and literally got to my house 2 hours before 6 flags closed. It was an hour drive to 6 flags so I said let’s just forget it because there’s no point of going for an hour. She flipped out saying she just got all ready to go so I said whatever. We get there and she wanted me to pay for the parking saying she had no cash on her, then when we got to the park she expected me to pay for her food , I was like what the hell is wrong with this girl. The next day came and she texted me asking me for gas money because it was a far drive . I lost it. I said “I literally paid for your whole night and you’re asking me for more money? Like your embarrassing at this point” 

I stopped talking to her but she would still call me here and there and sometimes I would answer and keep the convo short. 

I got pregnant and COMPLETELY cut her off with no warning , I didn’t want any people around me or my baby that weren’t genuine , I know she definitely wonders why I cut her off , but she also is the type to not think she did anything wrong by always expecting me to pay

**About the 'Episodes 1 to 405 Project'**

*\[Note: YouTube uploads are copyrighted, so enjoy this* [*Imgur Gallery*](https://imgur.com/gallery/mega64-podcast-complete-tRCnuzY) *with links\]*

At the start of each week leading up to The Mega64 Podcast’s 20th Anniversary on September 25, 2026 (and Podcast 1,000 too), we’re revisiting a classic episode exclusively on [r/Mega64](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mega64/), in order of release, starting way back in 2006! Who wants to live in 2025 anyway right now, am I right?

Thanks to the brilliant [u/hadzz46](https://www.reddit.com/user/hadzz46/), we have the incredible [mega64.org](http://mega64.org/) — an excellent archive preserving episodes 1–405 of our beloved show, and these posts will prominently include (right after the chapters) links to each episode. The first 30 are pretty much audio-only, so please bear with! (psst: I highly suggest downloading as you go, just in case).

Obviously this is completely from a place of love and passion with zero profit (and to satisfy the collective OCD of several of us I’m sure), consisting very simply of 1) creating a classic thumbnail, 2) coming up with a classic podcast episode flavour title, and 3) posting the audio and video links here on [r/Mega64](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mega64/) for all to enjoy.

*Important Disclaimer: the keys to this project are ALWAYS available to the crew themselves to take up whenever they like — I’m just here to help, as another fan and passionate archivist, and lend some administrative aid that Mega64 simply might not have the time or resources for themselves. I’m self-outsourcing this entirely to me, and revisiting the show in the process, which is a huge perk of the job, considering how evergreen every episode is (also feels like chewing my food properly this time and getting all the nutrients for a change!).*

This is the perfect time to make these early episodes even more accessible for newcomers who want to start from the very beginning, also known as ‘The Mega64grimage’ — soaring across some of the best years of gaming, film, and the internet itself, before the soulless engagement-based hellscape it’s largely turned into, with Mega64 as one of the last surviving bastions. We must do all we can to help them continue on — the more Internet Soldierz, the better!

Follow along here on [r/Mega64](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mega64/), where — with the community’s blessing, which I’m truly humbled by (Start: [https://www.reddit.com/r/mega64/comments/1jif729/mega64\_podcast\_1\_haggling\_for\_fish](https://www.reddit.com/r/mega64/comments/1jif729/mega64_podcast_1_haggling_for_fish)) — we'll have a classic episode every week until we're well out of this kinda-cursed decade.

Full job description
WANTED: Permanent, full-time Service Mechanic. Must not resemble handsome Squidward. Don’t ask.

Job Summary:

Reporting to the Service Manager, the Service Advisor turns up, takes money off customers, and tries not to piss them off. You’re the face of the service department so... just make us look good, yeah?

If you are a Motorcycle Service Advisor who wants to roll up to work, do your job, have some laughs with your coworkers, and then gtfo, look no further than Barnes Harley-Davidson!

What we offer:

MONEY NOW PLEASE – Best in industry pay. Our incentive-based pay plans for most positions mean you are in charge of what you earn. There is no cap, because that would be rude.

BUT I NEED BENEFITS – Fine. Health, dental, vision, vacation days, paid sick days, mental healthcare, gym membership reimbursement, motorcycle riding courses, crazy staff discounts, free coffee whenever you want, and free lunch every Saturday. Happy now?

I WANT A CAREER – Well, we build them. We have people that go from washing bikes to running dealerships. Just ask that goofy-looking GM walking around the building. If that’s what you want, we will make it happen.

BIG BRAIN TIME – You’re going to end up knowing a lot more than you’ll ever need. Our receptionists know how to change the oil on a bike... which is unnecessary but true. With our internal Barnes University training programs and manufacturer factory training, our brains stay wrinkly.

GOOD PEOPLE – We are hardcore bikers, people who have never touched a motorcycle in their lives, parents, animal-lovers, geeks, foodies, movie buffs, car fanatics, artists, caffeine-addicts, amateur comedians, true crime fans, partakers of the ganja, warlocks, paladins, and more. You’ll make friends here, guaranteed.

Sins of the Saints
chapter 1 Repent
Sarah Marie Esposito lifted her chin, willing the power of the Lord flow over her as she sang her solo during the mass while communion was being served. She was too distracted though and while she could sing this song in her sleep and never miss a note, she felt her heart was in the wrong for not being solely focused on the beautiful lyrics, an ode to Jesus.

Her uncle, her mother’s brother, Father Ippocrate Giannone was conducting the service and at the moment he was the reason she was nervous. He’d approached her earlier, a prideful tilt to his head, his robes swishing with his brusque movements and announced he wanted to see her immediately following mass.

The twenty-five other choir members were all wide-eyed as his judgemental eyes stared down at her. All she could offer was a meek “yes Father Giannone” before he swirled back out of the room with a flourish.

Now watching from the back of the church, in the high loft overlooking the church, she noticed his eyes kept flicking to a man sitting in the front row. She couldn’t see the other man’s face but knew he wasn’t someone from their parish, certain she would have recognized the man from his build alone.

As she stepped back to her place in the choir, her best friend Sophie elbowed her, whispering. “What do you think he wants?”

“I didn’t know the last six times you asked.” She exhaled shakily.

“Do you think he found out we stayed late Thursday night? I mean we were only praying. We locked up right? We didn’t forget to lock the chapel when we left?”

“We locked up, Sophie. He wouldn’t be angry we stayed longer to pray.”

“Did you confess a sin?”

“No.”

The choir director turned and shot them warning glances as the communion service drew to a close and they froze.

By the time Sarah hung her robe and assured Sophie she would meet her back at their apartment, she was decidedly more nervous than previously. Dawdling, offering to tidy the room, she hung back until the last of the choir members left.

Her uncle never was a friendly fellow, despite being a priest. Where some were warm, kind and loving, forgiving transgressions in the name of Jesus, her uncle tended to cast judgements of hell, fire, and brimstone without second thoughts. Her skin more than once felt the whip of his flogger used to punish her for the sins she was undoubtedly committing in her mind.

Since the death of his parents, Ippocrate declared himself the head of the family, which consisted of himself, Zipporah his only sibling, and her daughter Sarah. Zipporah spent more time on her knees praying than Sarah did, and it was saying something. Her mother had been repenting since she’d found herself pregnant at sixteen from the sweet words of a bad boy. Her parents refused to consider adoption for their only child and insisted all children were blessings and forced Zipporah to raise her baby. Then they died when Sarah was only two and it left the mother and child under the watchful and ever condescending eyes of Father Ippocrate.

She was startled by movement near the door since she was supposed to be alone and looked up in alarm. The man with the broad shoulders who’d been sitting in the front row of service was in the choir room.

“Hello,” she nodded nervously. She rarely was near a boy or a man alone. She worked in a dentist office so there were times patients were in the room waiting but this felt different. He was one of the most handsome men she ever saw before. Dark blue eyes, the color of overripe blueberries which would pop on the tongue, bored into her pale brown ones. His hair was thick, black, and glossy, slicked back away from his temples. His shoulders were wide enough she could likely put three of her side to side and there would be room to spare, and he was well over six feet tall and as her eyes perused his frame, trim and fit. Her gaze roving back to his face noted the straight nose and thick lips and she was transfixed as he drew his tongue over the bottom lip which curved into the smallest hint of a smile.

“Scusi,” his thick Italian accent rolled off a tongue which offered a growly voice. His eyes mocked as he caught her looking at his body.

She blushed a hot red, “can I help you?”

“What are you doing?” he asked nodding to the book in her hand.

She swallowed nervously, “I was putting the last of the hymnals away in their proper place. Director Mallorca requested I do so before I go home.”

“And where is home?”

The curious edge to his voice gave her pause and she whispered, “it is not a far walk from here.” She took a breath and rushed out, “can I help you, sir? I need to see my uncle as he’s waiting for me.”

“Sir?” he chuckled, “oh sweet Sarah, is this how you would address me?”

“Do we know each other?” she frowned at him. She couldn’t place him. If anything, his eyes would be ones to remember, she was sure of it.

“Not yet, amoré.”

He stepped further into the room, and she knew her eyes were cartoonishly wide as he moved towards her and from the way he moved she almost wondered if the man floated, his eyes focused on her like a hawk eying it’s prey. She was backed against the shelves of books, her fingers clutched tight around the hymnal in her hand and her breath coming to a full stop. Her eyes closed and she tilted her head away from him as he leaned over her, his nose brushing up the side of her neck as if he were sniffing her, his breath hot in her ear when he whispered.

“So fucking innocent. Almost worth saying a prayer of thanks.” He stood upright and cupped her chin, “I will see you soon.” His lips burned her forehead with a kiss.

Without further ado he stood upright and walked back to the door. She was trembling in terror and an awareness of a man she’d never experienced before. The way he intimately breathed against her neck made goosebumps cover her flesh and she could still feel his lips on her forehead.

“Sarah,” he turned at the door, giving her a hard look, this one scary, menacing and she struggled to catch a breath at his frigid countenance, “you best remain untouched until then or there will be hell to pay.”

With that he disappeared into the church, and she gripped the bookshelf behind her wondering what was happening and why was her heart pounding so hard. Fear was certainly one reason but another emotion, one she never allowed herself to experience before teased her brain. She almost fell to her knees in repentance.

chapter 2 Betrothed
Standing outside her uncle’s office in the rectory of the church she folded her hands in front of her waist and prayed he wasn’t angry with her.

“Are you going to stand out there all day, Sarah?”

“I’m sorry, Father.”

Her uncle, now in his fifties, had greying at his temples and a deep v of frown lines between his eyebrows. He looked impatiently at her, “you took your time.”

“It was my turn to tidy the practice room. I apologize.”

“Sit.”

She took the seat opposite his desk and waited with her hands folded primly on her lap. He gave a deep sigh and then finally lifted his eyes to her.

“We all come into this world born of sin.”

She kept her face neutral as he started what she anticipated was going to be a long, lengthy lecture on whatever mistake she made.

“You are no exception, Sarah.” His hands steepled on his desk as he regarded her coolly. “You know your mother was coerced by your father to do the unforgiveable. It was a joke of course. The young man was egged on by his friends to seduce the virgin in their class,” he inhaled sharply and eyed her with disgust while he regaled her with her origin story, a version she heard more than once in the past. “You were born because your father was the worst kind of man, preying on the vulnerabilities of a woman who was helpless to do nothing but succumb to the wickedness of her teenage hormones and lust like a whore.”

“Yes Father,” she didn’t know how to shut him down once he started.

“Do you know the name Ethan Lucchesi?”

“No. Is he, my father?”

He gave a bitter laugh, “no, though I wouldn’t be surprised if the man doesn’t have a half-dozen illegitimate offspring from his exploits. He is the son of Dagoberto Lucchesi.” When she still appeared uncertain of what he was asking, “do you know what the mafia is, Sarah?”

“I know there are criminal organizations which are called mafia other than this, no.”

“You are sheltered here in Providence,” he said bluntly.

“I choose to live my life to honor God,” she looked down at her feet. Since her private all-girls Catholic school when she was five and her church-affiliated college where she earned her degree as a medical receptionist, she continued to practice the teachings.

“Fat lot of good it’s going to do you now,” her uncle muttered.

She considered perhaps she’d misheard him as he rose and moved to look out the window behind his desk.

“I worked hard to be a man of the cloth. I always felt strongly my chastity was of value to the Lord. I know it pleases him. Your mother was weak letting a man have sex with her. However, our parents felt differently.”

She never heard him speak so bitterly about her grandparents but the way he mentioned them in this moment, she could almost feel the rage rolling off him.

“They felt she was taken advantage of, violated even, despite the fact she parted her legs of her own volition. It didn’t matter the man seduced her or made promises, she chose to get fucked and then knocked up.”

The disgusting word spilling from her uncle’s lips made her gasp.

“When you were born, your mother tried to get your father to take responsibility. Instead, he further humiliated her and caused such a scene she was ready to commit the most egregious of sins and attempted suicide.”

She did not know this part of her mother’s story and felt sick to her stomach, “she tried to kill herself?”

“Yes. The worm who contributed to your creation told her she should end her life because there was no way he would ever accept a child, and he would spend the rest of his life making sure the entire world knew how much of a slut she was. He threatened to release the video online. He was from a high-profile family here in Rhode Island. My father, realizing how much the release of a video of my sister having orgasms at the hands of her defiler would have been detrimental to his business and to my career as a man of God, took matters into his own hands.”

She was at a loss. What on earth was she supposed to say? “Why are you telling me this now?”

“Because you are now twenty-one. Twenty-two in a few months actually. It is time for you to repay the debt.”

“The debt?”

“My father went to Don Dagoberto Lucchesi, the boss of the Lucchesi family and asked him for help with their situation.” He grunted, “my father is roasting in hell right now for paying for a man to be murdered simply because his daughter was a modern-day harlot who could not control her own urges.” He turned to face her completely now, his hands clasped behind his back as he sneered down at her.

“Murder?”

“My father asked Don Lucchesi to get rid of your father to save our family the embarrassment of the actions of your mother. In exchange for a large sum of cash and a betrothal, the Don accepted the offer.”

“Betrothal?” this was a word she knew. She sang frequently at weddings in the church, and she often prepared the banners for announcements of marriage.

“Yes. You were offered as a bride to his eldest son and the second-in-command of the Lucchesi family, Ethan Lucchesi. You have been betrothed to him since you were only days old. Our family was ordered to keep you pure.” He gave a shake of his head, “unfortunately for you, your husband-to-be does not share the values instilled into you since birth. He’s corrupted in the most villainous of ways.”

“Husband-to-be?” Her ears were ringing, and she felt very much like she was underwater struggling to surface from the crushing weight on her chest.

“You will marry Ethan Lucchesi in one week from now.”

“I don’t want to.” She wanted to run out of the room but knew her legs would fail her. She sat trembling.

“You have no choice, Sarah. You were part of the deal to murder your father in exchange for the sanctity of our family. If we renege on the deal, then the three of us, you, your mother, and me, will all be dealt with.”

“Dealt with.”

“Killed, Sarah. You don’t mess with a family like this one and we cannot go against them. They are powerful and dangerous and frankly there is nothing I can do to help you now. They have come to collect their debt. You will be married next Saturday morning here in this church.” He finally gave her a look which bordered sympathetic, “and may God have mercy on your soul.”

Sarah was grateful for her friend. Sophie pulled her tablet onto her lap, snuggling next to Sarah under the blanket in Sarah’s bed offering comfort. When Sarah arrived home two hours ago, dissolving into a fit of tears, her best friend bundled her into bed holding while she cried. Then when Sarah revealed the details of her uncle’s words, despite his order not to tell anyone, Sophie was the requisite amounts of furious, aghast, and terrified for her friend.

If anyone knew how sheltered Sarah was, it was her best friend. Sophie’s parents were as devout as Sarah’s mother and uncle. Sophie’s mother met her father when she was on a spiritual retreat in a quest to decide if she was meant to be a nun or to devote her life in other ways to God. They ran the bookstore associated with the church., Sophie’s aunt was the Sister who ran the school the girls attended. Sophie’s grandfather was a deacon in the church and his wife was the church secretary.

“We’re going to look him up online.”

“I don’t want to do this.” Sarah shivered nervously. “How can they have bartered me, and my life then kept it a secret all this time?”

“I don’t know but Sarah, we prayed on it.” Sophie suddenly made wide eyes, “do you think this is because of Thursday night?”

“What?”

“When we stayed late in church to pray to find true love.”

“Do you think God would answer my prayers to find true love by giving me a mobster for a husband?”

“Maybe he’s a nice mobster?” Sophie asked despite knowing how absurd the question was.

“Pretty sure there is no such thing.” Sarah watched with bated breath as her friend pulled up an internet browser and typed in the name of the man, she was supposed to be marrying the following week.

Freezing at the first image which popped up she whispered, “oh my goodness.”

“What?”

“He’s the guy who came into the choir room today.”

“This guy? When?”

“After you all left, he stopped in. I’m supposed to marry him?” she shivered and pulled her blanket tighter.

“He’s old.” Sophie whispered. “He’s,” she scrolled through a page which highlighted his statistics as if he were a sports athlete, “thirty-five, Sarah. You're engaged to a man who is thirteen years older than you are.” Sophie clicked on the images-icon on her browser and the two girls cocked their heads in the same direction as they regarded the number of photos there.

“I don’t think any of these women are the same ones,” Sarah whispered. “They saved my family from embarrassment by marrying me off to a man-whore?” She tapped her finger on the screen to open a link under one of the photos and they both were wide-eyed at the image under the original one and the byline of the story. It was the man standing with a woman behind him and while parts of the photograph were blurred, what was apparent was they were both naked and Ethan was pointing a weapon.

“Where do you think he had the gun?” Sophie asked her lips pressed together as she stared at the photo.

“Between her boobs?” Sarah offered as she made a gun-shape with her fingers and thumb and tucked them between Sophie’s breasts and then pulled them out in a flash and pulled her thumb back like a trigger.

Sophie howled with laughter at Sarah’s actions. “No! Between his butt cheeks?”

“Not in a million years,” she giggled back. “I watched him walk out of the choir room. His butt was too rounded and tight.”

“You looked at his butt?”

“How could I not? He sniffed me Sophie.”

“Show me?” Sophie laughed. “Show me how he did it.”

She turned Sophie’s head and then ran her nose along her best friend’s neck all the way to her ear and then growled in her ear.

Sophie fanned herself. “How did you not pee yourself?”

“I almost did.”

“Did he really tell you to remain untouched?”

“Yes. The look on his face was scary as hell. Kind of like this one,” she pointed back to the photo where he was glowering at whoever it was who took the picture.

Sophie scrolled through some other photos and clicked on one where Ethan was with three women lounging in a hot tub on a private yacht. “Seriously, Sarah, you should ask him to get an STD test done first. Remember the girl in college who was told she couldn’t have children because she caught the disease?”

“Yes. I felt bad for her. She and her husband were trying so hard until she found out he cheated on her and got her infected. She didn’t know until it was too late. I prayed so hard for her to be cured.”

“Me too.” Sophie clasped her hands around her knees.

The two girls started reading article after article about Ethan Lucchesi and each one was more frightening than the last. Multiple women, a few who fought in the streets over him, were associated with his name. Criminals involved in dealing drugs and guns and something called racketeering which they needed to look up to understand were all known associates of the man. He was suspected of multiple murders and ordering hits on people. Many of the things he was accused of doing were allegedly on behalf of his father. One article even went so far as to say he was more lethal than the patriarch to the Lucchesi family.

They were reading a story now dubbed The Affluent Assassin and it spoke about his billions of dollars net worth and whether many of his homes and cars were gains from illegal activities.

“It’s like this guy gets high on thumbing his nose to everything good and decent in the world. I bet if there was a law which said you shouldn’t punch dogs in the face, he’d make it a sporting event.” Sophie whispered shaking her head incredulously. “He really doesn’t care.”

“I can’t marry this man. His arrogance and hubris are out of this world.”

Sophie paused as Sarah also froze at a point in the story, “does this say his home is in New York and he spends most of his time there?”

“Yes.”

“Are you going to have to move to New York?”

Sarah’s throat felt like it was closing off. This couldn’t be happening. She shook her head vehemently refusing to believe it to be true, “I don’t know. I don’t want to move, Sophie. I have a job. I have a life. I have friends. I don’t want to move away.”

As another fear was unlocked, Sarah wondered if her day could get any worse.

chapter 4 A Call
Sophie was gripping Sarah’s shoulders shaking her frantically, “we live together Sarah. I can’t afford rent without you. We do this together. I might have to move back in with my parents. Sarah, I don’t’ want you to move away.” Sophie started to cry now.

Sarah threw her arms around her friend hugging her tight, “I love you. I don’t want to go. I don’t want to get married.”

“What are we going to do?” Sophie wailed into her shoulder.

“Let’s look to see if he has a house here in Rhode Island,” she pushed Sophie away frantically. “He has to have a place nearby. I can’t move away from you.”

Multiple times they plugged into the browser but there was nothing which linked this man to her home city Providence.

Suddenly her cell phone rang. Sarah noticed the number was not one she was familiar with. A deep sense of foreboding filled her stomach. She stared at it while it rang several times.

“Aren’t you going to answer it?” Sophie whispered.

She shook her head unable to speak. The phone stopped ringing, and she let out a sigh of relief only to choke on her spit when it rang again.

“I think you need to answer it.”

“What if it’s him?”

“Find out what he wants.”

“I’m scared.”

“Just do it.”

She answered the phone with a tentative, “hello.”

“Do not make me wait again, amoré. I am not a patient man.”

“I’m sorry, sir.”

“Ethan.” He spoke bluntly. “You are to call me Ethan. Are you excited for Saturday?”

“Should I be?” she looked at Sophie who was agape in disbelief, of what, Sarah wasn’t sure.

“Yes. Your life is about to change, Sarah.”

“I like my life.” She pressed her lips to try to stop from crying again. She was a woman who could take twenty strikes of her uncle’s flogger without a sound now. She was strong.

“You like working in a dentistry office for a dentist who reports your every action to your uncle? Have you ever done anything without his approval in the past?”

“I do lots of things I want.”

“Name three.”

“I went to the movies last weekend and he didn’t approve. Sophie and I went to the fair a few weeks ago and didn’t get home until late at night. We drank a bottle of wine with our dinner last night.”

“I’m marrying the patron saint of boredom.” He grunted. “I know you’ve never fucked but name three boys you’ve kissed.” At her silence he laughed, “I’m teasing. I know you’ve never kissed a man.”

“I have too,” she blurted out, connecting eyes with a shocked Sophie.

His voice was gruff, “who? Who dared to put their lips on what is mine?”

“I might be a virgin, Ethan,” she found her voice, “but it doesn’t mean a man has never shown interest in me or for me to be interested in a man. I have even been on dates.”

“With whom? I want the names now.”

“Will you be providing me a list of all the women you’ve dated?” She was strangely feeling powerful as she rendered him speechless, “though based on what I’ve seen on the internet, there may be men in the list as well. Will you be providing me a sexual health panel along with the names of your partners? At least all I would need share is the name of a handful of boys who kissed me if we’re making comparative notes.” She looked at the photo again of him naked pointing a weapon. “I don’t have my adventures plastered all over the web for the globe to look at.”

“You kissed more than one man?”

“Multiple,” she wasn’t lying. “I haven’t lived at home or on college campus for nearly eighteen months Ethan. Simply because my uncle has spies in my employer, my choir director, or the people of our community in the city doesn’t mean I don’t still do the things I wish to do.”

“What kind of dates?”

The way the words gritted through his teeth made her snicker against the palm of her hand. “I’ve been on dinner dates, to the movies, walks in the park, coffee dates and even once to a place where music was being played where we slow danced. I didn’t know until today I was betrothed. How was I supposed to know I didn’t need look for a life partner on my own? Though, I am hoping you don’t show up on Saturday and this all goes away.”

“I will be there on Saturday, Sarah. I warn you now do not attempt to live an entire life in a week. If you go on one other date I will know, and you will be punished.”

She clenched her jaw at the threat and her nostrils flared angrily, “I have been punished before.”

“Is that so? I cannot imagine your priest of an uncle, or your saintly mother would be as cruel as I can be.”

She thought of the times her uncle made her lift her shirt so he could punish her with his flogger leaving raised welts on her skin which sometimes broke open. Her mother never once stopped him despite Sarah enduring the strikes since she was a mere five years old.

“Is there a purpose to your call this evening, aside from threatening me to keep my chastity lest I be beaten by a thug who likes to be photographed in various forms of undress with more women than there are in my entire congregation?”

“You are not educated as to who I am yet, amoré.”

“I am not your love. I do not want to marry you. I do not want any of this. I won’t be going on dates this week, Ethan because I’m going to be on my knees praying for God to save me from the devil. I will be fasting, praying, reading my bible day and night for a way to get out of this horrible situation. You are not a good man, Ethan Lucchesi and I deserve a good man. I believe in my heart, it is what God wants for me.”

His dark chuckle caused goosebumps to rise along her skin. “You are right about one thing, I am not a good man but what God wants is irrelevant. You are mine and not even if He descended from heaven itself and stood at the altar would He be able to rip what is rightfully mine from my grip.”

“You’re a beast.”

“You’re right. I am. The Beast if you will.”

Her heart thundered at his words and Sarah considered perhaps she shouldn’t have been so emboldened by the faceless telephone conversation because his parting words nearly made her faint.

“You’re going to see how much of an animal I am on Saturday night when we begin our honeymoon. If you should pray for anything this week, may I suggest you pray for stamina and endurance. You’re going to need it.”

One day an elderly couple came in with their GenX age daughter. It was difficult to hear the elderly couple because of their quieter voices, mask, plastic barriers, and coffee grinder that was next to me. The elderly couple started asking about pastries we didn’t carry but I was able to hear the older woman say peach which I assumed meant she was asking about a fresh peach, which we didn’t have either but I said we have oranges and bananas if she wanted fruit. 

At that point their daughter snaps at me with a very condescending tone with “No she’s asking for a pie. You know a pie? Ever heard of a pie? They’re shaped like this *makes gesture of what the size of a pie would be* and have fruit fillings??” Just like super rude and belittling, and my heart kinda drops because, obviously, it’s not nice to be talked to like you’re an idiot. So I just politely say “sorry no we don’t have that”. Finally, they order their coffees along with and the daughter got an avocado bagel so I go into the back to make the bagel. As the daughter didn’t not look like the “I enjoy spicy food” type, once the bagel was toasted I absolutely packed it with red chili flakes put avocado on top of the layer of red chilies to hide them. Added the other seasonings along with the regular amount of red chili flakes that are supposed to go on top of the avocado.

A few weeks later the same trio came in and the daughter got an avocado bagel again, this time without chili flakes 😎

Edit: I want to clarify that only avocado bagel on the menu listed all the ingredients (avocado, S&P, feta, red chili flakes) so if there was a risk of allergy to red chilies she would have been aware of them being on the bagel. Also it was only the daughter that got the bagel not her parents",14,1749780808.0,pettyrevenge,2,0.86,False
1la4k1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewRequests/comments/1la4k1e/looking_for_feedback_on_spacesaving_furniture/,Looking for feedback on space-saving furniture + fitness hybrid concept,"Hi everyone! I’m currently participating in a high school summer entrepreneurship program where we go through the full process of developing a product idea. I’d really appreciate your honest thoughts on the early-stage concept I’m working on.

**The concept:**  
It’s a multi-functional piece of furniture, like a coffee table or ottoman, that also works as a compact workout station. It’s designed to blend into small living spaces like studio apartments, and can support exercises like:

* Resistance band workouts (back, shoulders, arms, glutes)
* Bodyweight exercises (incline/decline pushups, tricep dips, step-ups)
* Core exercises (planks, leg raises, seated twists)

The idea is to remove the visual and physical clutter of traditional workout gear and make it easier to stay active in tight spaces without needing to rearrange your home or buy multiple pieces of equipment.

**What I'd love feedback on:**

* Do you think there’s a real need or audience for something like this?
* What concerns or drawbacks do you immediately see?
* If you live in a small space or value low-effort fitness setups, is this something *you* or someone you know might use?
* Any ideas for how it could be improved or made more appealing?

This is very early-stage, and I’m not selling anything, I’m just trying to make the concept stronger by learning what people actually care about.

Thanks in advance for any feedback you’re willing to share, even short comments are super helpful!",1,1749780762.0,ReviewRequests,0,1.0,False

Suddenly I got diagnosed with pcos and got acne and all that stuff it was new to me as its the first time in 25years old to get acne and to have a missed period. I got my periods while I was studying 5th std lol.

I went back to a strict pcos diet, like stopped eating diary, gluten, white rice, any high carb item like deep fried, sugary item and junk foods (im a south indian and I couldnt even eat dosa, rarely idli).
Exercised and did yoga, drank everyday morning spearmint tea. Lots of veggies and fish.

Omega and vitamin D + B12 supplement. No meat. Only fish, prawn and egg for protein.

Instead of paneer ate tofu.
Slept for more than 8 hours, before 12am to bed. I did all this and my period became 28 days regular for straight 5 months before that I didnt get my periods for more than 60days.

My doc gave me some med to get that month alone and due to routine change it was super regular for continuous 5 months, without taking meds.

Then, on this month, due to a lot of birthday parties and outing I ate a lot of sweets and I went easy on me like I used to eat just quinoa roti, this time I started eating normal chapathi. Ate like a normal girl one time cow milk coffee bla bla and slept late but still it was 8 hrs plus.

And wasnt very strict on my workout routine as well as my work was tight this month. Guess what, I didnt get my periods this month, its already 20 days late and there are no signs. Just PMS pain for straight 20 days.


Like wth seriously I go little out of my crazy diet and this shit would disappear??? So I cant catch a break, should eat like a crazy person my entire fucking life.


My life is so fucked up, how am i not supposed to get stressed when my body is torturing me like this. I’m pretty sure if I go back to my crazy ass diet i would be fine, but at what cost….

1la4ffn,https://youtu.be/au8QYNmLKvs,3 Very Scary TRUE RV Roadside Assistance Horror Stories,"# ""The Man on County Road 19"":

I was cruising along a deserted Texas backroad in my old RV, the kind of road where the horizon stretches forever and the only signs of life are tumbleweeds and the occasional buzzard circling overhead. The trip was my chance to unplug, to escape the noise of the city and find some peace. The RV, a beat-up rental I’d nicknamed “The Beast,” rattled with every mile, but I trusted it to get me through. Then, with a deafening bang, the whole thing lurched hard to the left, nearly throwing me out of the driver’s seat. My heart slammed against my ribs as I wrestled the wheel, pulling onto the gravel shoulder. The front left tire was gone—shredded into strips of rubber dangling like torn flesh. I sat there, hands shaking, staring at the mess. This was not part of the plan.I stepped out, my boots crunching on the loose gravel, the air thick with the smell of hot rubber and dust. I walked around the RV, inspecting the damage. The rim was bent, and the tire was beyond repair. I pulled out my phone, hoping for a signal, but the screen mocked me with zero bars. Of course. I’d read about these dead zones in Texas, but I didn’t think I’d be stuck in one. Digging through the glovebox, I found the satellite phone the rental company had insisted I take. It felt clunky in my hand, like something from a 90s sci-fi movie. I dialed the roadside assistance number taped to the dashboard.It rang for what felt like forever before a woman answered, her voice flat and tired. “Roadside assistance. What’s the problem?”“My tire blew out,” I said, trying to sound calm. “I’m on some backroad in Texas, near mile marker 247. No cell service out here.”She sighed, like I was the tenth stranded idiot she’d talked to that day. “Alright, we’ll send someone. Could be two, maybe three hours. Stay with the vehicle. Got a name for the road?”I glanced at the crumpled map on the passenger seat. “It’s County Road 19, I think.”“Got it. Stay put,” she said, and the line went dead.I climbed back into the RV, locking the door behind me. The interior was cramped but familiar—worn leather seats, a tiny kitchenette with a coffee-stained counter, and a fold-out bed in the back. The dashboard lights cast a faint green glow, making the space feel smaller, more claustrophobic. I checked my watch: 6:47 p.m. The sun was dipping low, and shadows were creeping across the road. I sipped water from a plastic bottle, trying to shake the uneasy feeling settling in my chest. Being stuck out here, alone, with no way to call for help except that clunky satellite phone, made my skin crawl.An hour dragged by. I kept glancing at the side mirrors, half-expecting something to appear. Then I heard it—a low, throaty rumble, like an engine growling in the distance. Headlights flashed in my rearview mirror, and a beat-up pickup truck pulled up behind me, its paint chipped and rusted. My stomach knotted. The roadside assistance woman said two hours at least. This was too soon.A man stepped out of the truck, tall and wiry, with a tangled mess of hair and a beard that looked like it hadn’t seen a razor in years. His flannel shirt was stained, and his jeans hung loose on his frame. He walked toward my RV, his boots scraping the gravel with slow, deliberate steps. My pulse quickened. I double-checked the lock on the door, my fingers fumbling. He stopped at the driver’s side window and knocked—three sharp raps that made me jump.I cracked the window an inch, just enough to hear him. “You okay in there?” he asked, his voice low, with a drawl that felt too calm, too practiced. His eyes were locked on mine, unblinking, like a predator sizing up prey.“I’m fine,” I said, forcing my voice to stay steady. “Roadside assistance is coming.”He leaned closer, his fingers gripping the edge of the window frame, dirt caked under his nails. “That so? This road’s no place to be stuck, you know. Lonely spot. Bad things happen out here.” His lips twitched into a smile, but it was all teeth, no warmth.“I’m good,” I said, sharper this time. “Thanks for checking.”He didn’t budge, just stood there, his gaze drilling into me. “Sure you don’t need a hand? I got tools in my truck. Could fix that tire real quick.” His voice was smooth, but it sent a shiver down my spine.“No, really, I’m fine,” I said, my hand hovering near the window crank, ready to shut it. “They’re on their way.”He tilted his head, like he was studying me. “Alright, suit yourself. I’ll be right over there if you change your mind.” He jerked his thumb toward his truck and walked back, but he didn’t get in. Instead, he leaned against the hood, pulling out a cigarette and lighting it. The orange glow flickered in the growing darkness, and he just stood there, watching my RV.My heart was hammering now. I slammed the window shut and locked it, my hands shaking so bad I dropped the crank. I checked the door again, then the back entrance, making sure every lock was secure. The satellite phone sat on the passenger seat, useless unless I needed to call again. I turned off the interior lights, hoping he’d think I was asleep or not paying attention. The darkness inside the RV felt suffocating, but I didn’t want him seeing me.Minutes crawled by. I sat in the driver’s seat, barely breathing, listening for any sound. Then I heard it—footsteps, slow and heavy, crunching on the gravel. They weren’t coming from the road. They were circling the RV, moving from the back toward the side. My chest tightened. I grabbed the flashlight from under the seat, its weight cold and solid in my hand. The footsteps stopped near the back door, and then I heard something else—a low, guttural growl, like a dog or maybe a coyote. My blood ran cold. I didn’t know what was worse: the man or whatever was out there with him.I crept to the side window, pulling the curtain back just a sliver. The flashlight beam shook in my hand as I aimed it outside. Nothing. Just darkness and the faint outline of cacti. The footsteps started again, closer now, right by the door. The growl came again, louder, more aggressive. I flicked off the flashlight and sank to the floor, my back against the driver’s seat, trying not to make a sound. The footsteps paused, then faded, like he’d walked back to his truck. I waited, counting my breaths, praying he was gone.Another hour passed, or maybe it just felt like it. Headlights lit up the road again, and a tow truck rolled up, its yellow beacon flashing like a lifeline. A man climbed out, stocky, with a grease-stained jumpsuit and a toolbox in hand. “You the one with the tire?” he called, his voice gruff but not threatening.I opened the door, relief flooding through me. “Yes, thank you,” I said, stepping out. My eyes darted to the pickup truck. The creepy man was still there, leaning against his hood, the cigarette glow pulsing like a heartbeat.The tow truck guy noticed my glance. His name tag read Joe. “That fella bother you?” he asked, keeping his voice low as he set up a jack under the RV.“He offered to help,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “But he’s just… standing there. Watching.”Joe’s jaw tightened as he worked the jack. “Yeah, well, keep your doors locked. Guys like him hang around these roads, looking for folks like you. Stranded. Easy targets.” He grabbed a wrench, his movements quick and practiced. “Heard stories ‘round here. People go missing sometimes. RVs, cars, doesn’t matter. Cops find the vehicles later, empty. No trace.”My stomach lurched. “Missing?” I asked, my voice shaking.He nodded, not looking up from the tire. “Yeah. Last year, a couple in an RV like yours vanished ‘bout twenty miles from here. Found their rig, but no sign of them. Folks say there’s people out here who know these roads better than the cops do.” He glanced at the pickup truck. “Just watch yourself, alright?”I nodded, my eyes locked on the man. He hadn’t moved, just stood there, staring. Joe finished the tire in under twenty minutes, wiping his hands on a rag. “You’re good to go,” he said. “Get outta here fast. Don’t stop for anyone, no matter what they say.”“Thanks,” I said, climbing back into the RV. My hands were still trembling as I started the engine. The pickup truck’s headlights flicked on as I pulled away, and in my rearview mirror, I saw it start to follow. My heart raced. I pressed the gas harder, the RV groaning as it picked up speed. The truck stayed behind me, its lights never fading, a constant shadow in my mirrors.Fifteen miles down the road, the engine sputtered. A sharp, chemical smell hit my nose—gasoline. I glanced at the fuel gauge, and my heart sank. The needle was dropping fast, way too fast. I pulled over, my hands shaking as I grabbed the flashlight and stepped out. Under the RV, a dark puddle spread across the gravel, the stench of fuel overwhelming. A leak. I cursed, kicking the gravel, and grabbed the satellite phone again.“It’s me,” I said when the roadside assistance woman answered. “The RV’s leaking fuel now. I’m maybe fifteen miles from where I was, still on County Road 19.”She sighed again. “Alright, we’ll send someone. Stay inside. Lock the doors. Could be another hour.”I hung up, my chest tight with panic. I locked the doors and checked the windows, my eyes scanning the darkness. That’s when I saw it—the pickup truck, parked a hundred yards back, its lights off but its shape unmistakable. My blood ran cold. I turned off all the RV’s lights, crouching low in the driver’s seat, clutching the flashlight like it could save me.Minutes passed, maybe ten, maybe twenty. Then I heard the footsteps again, slow and deliberate, crunching closer. A shadow moved outside the driver’s side window, tall and lean. The door handle jiggled, just once, soft but unmistakable. My heart stopped. I gripped the flashlight tighter, my knuckles white.“Go away!” I shouted, my voice cracking with fear.The shadow froze, then shifted. I heard the crunch of gravel as he stepped back, but he didn’t leave. I could feel his eyes on the RV, like a weight pressing down. I stayed low, barely breathing, waiting for him to try again. The satellite phone sat useless in my lap. I didn’t dare move to call again, not with him so close.Another set of headlights finally appeared, cutting through the darkness. A new tow truck pulled up, and a woman stepped out, her flashlight sweeping the area. “You okay in there?” she called, her voice firm but kind.I opened the door, nearly sobbing with relief. “Yeah,” I said, my voice shaky. “There’s a guy—he’s been following me. He tried the door.”Her name tag read Lisa. She glanced at the pickup truck, which was pulling away now, its taillights fading into the night. “You’re lucky,” she said, her face grim as she knelt to check the fuel line. “We got a call last month, same road. Guy like that was involved. Cops think he’s been targeting RVs, waiting for breakdowns. They’ve been trying to catch him, but he knows these roads too well.”My knees felt weak. “Targeting?” I asked, my voice barely audible.She nodded, her hands moving fast with a wrench. “Yeah. Last one was a family. RV broke down, and they were gone by morning. Found the vehicle, nothing else. You don’t wanna know the rest.” She patched the fuel line, her movements quick and precise. “This’ll hold till you get to a town. There’s a gas station twenty miles up, well-lit, lots of people. Go straight there and don’t stop.”I nodded, my hands still trembling as I climbed back into the RV. “Thank you,” I said, my voice barely holding together.“Don’t thank me yet,” Lisa said, standing up. “If you see that truck again, call the cops. And I mean right away.”I started the engine, the RV rumbling to life. The pickup truck was gone, but I kept checking my mirrors, expecting those headlights to reappear. I drove faster than I should have, the patched fuel line holding just enough to get me to the gas station. When I pulled into the lot, surrounded by bright lights and a few late-night truckers, I finally let myself breathe. I parked and sat there, gripping the wheel, my heart still pounding.I never saw the man again, but Lisa’s words burned in my mind. People vanish on these roads, their vehicles left behind like ghosts. I don’t know if I escaped a bad tire and a fuel leak or something far worse. All I know is I’ll never drive that stretch of Texas again, not for anything.

  


# ""The Man in the Desert"":

I was cruising along a desolate stretch of Nevada desert in my old RV, the kind with faded stripes and a creaky frame, heading for a small town I’d seen on the map. The road was a ribbon of cracked asphalt, cutting through endless sand and scrub. Everything felt calm until a deafening bang jolted me. The RV lurched hard to the right, tires screeching. My heart slammed against my ribs as I wrestled the steering wheel, barely managing to pull onto the gravel shoulder. Dust clouded around me as I stopped. I climbed out, legs shaky, and saw the back tire in ruins—rubber shredded, rim bent, pieces strewn across the road like a crime scene. I had no spare. The nearest town was 50 miles away. I checked my phone: no signal, just a blank screen mocking me. My stomach knotted up, tight and cold.Back inside the RV, I locked every door and checked the windows twice. The silence out there was heavy, broken only by the faint hum of the cooling engine. I decided to wait for a passing car, someone who could help or at least point me to a signal. I sat at the little dinette table, sipping warm water from a bottle, staring at the curtains. Hours crawled by. Not a single headlight broke the darkness. The desert felt alive, watching me. Every creak of the RV’s frame or rustle outside made my pulse spike. I kept the lights off, not wanting to draw attention, but my eyes darted to every shadow. My mind churned with stories I’d heard—people stranded, never seen again. I pushed the thoughts away, but they clung like damp cloth.It must’ve been near midnight when I heard it: a slow crunch of gravel, deliberate, like someone stepping carefully. My breath caught. I froze, listening. Another crunch, closer. Then a beam of light sliced through the curtains, sweeping across the interior. A sharp knock on the door made me jump, my water bottle tipping over, spilling across the table. I didn’t move. Another knock, harder. “Hey, you in there?” a man’s voice called, rough but steady, like he was used to talking over engines. I stayed silent, heart pounding so loud I thought he’d hear it. “Saw your RV from the road,” he said. “You need help?” I crept to the door, gripping the edge of the counter. My phone was useless, and no one else was coming. I cracked the door an inch, just enough to see him. He was tall, maybe six-foot-two, wearing a stained denim jacket and jeans that looked like they’d seen better days. His face was half-hidden in the glow of his flashlight, but his eyes caught me—dark, restless, flicking from me to the RV’s interior. “Flat tire, right?” he said, not really asking. I nodded, throat tight. “I can fix it,” he said, “got tools and a spare in my truck.” I hadn’t heard a truck pull up. That made my skin prickle.“You with roadside assistance?” I asked, voice barely steady. He shook his head, smiling a little, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “Just passing by. I help out sometimes.” He gestured to a beat-up pickup parked a ways off, half-hidden in the dark. I hadn’t seen it before, and that made my chest tighten. “Okay,” I said, not sure I had a choice. “How long will it take?” He shrugged. “Couple hours, maybe. Gotta jack it up, swap the tire.” I nodded, keeping the door barely open. “Stay inside,” he said. “Safer that way.” The way he said it, like he knew something I didn’t, made my stomach twist.I locked the door again and sat by the window, peeking through a slit in the curtain. He moved slowly, setting up a jack and pulling tools from a rusty box. His flashlight bobbed, casting long shadows that danced across the sand. I kept a kitchen knife under the table, my fingers brushing its handle for comfort. “Where you headed?” he called out, not looking up as he worked the lug nuts. His voice carried an edge, like he was testing me. “Just a town up the road,” I said, keeping it vague. He chuckled, low and dry. “Smart. Folks get lost out here. Not a good place to be alone.” My mouth went dry. I didn’t answer.He worked for what felt like forever, the clank of tools and his low humming filling the night. Every so often, he’d stop, stand straight, and stare into the darkness, like he heard something. Once, he turned toward the RV, his eyes locked on the window where I sat. I ducked back, heart racing, sure he’d seen me. “You ever hear stories about this road?” he said suddenly, his voice cutting through the quiet. “People say things happen out here. Folks stop, then… poof. Gone.” He laughed, but it wasn’t funny. I gripped the knife tighter, my knuckles white.The longer he was there, the worse it felt. His truck’s cab was dark, but I swore I saw movement inside once, like someone else was there. I blinked, and it was gone, but the thought wouldn’t leave. He kept glancing around, not just at the RV but beyond it, into the desert. “Almost done,” he called, but his tone was off, like he was stalling. My mind raced. Was he really fixing the tire? Was he waiting for something—or someone? I checked the locks again, my hands sweaty, the knife now in my lap.Finally, he stood, wiping his hands on a rag. “All set,” he said, walking to the door. I opened it a crack, staying behind it. “How much?” I asked, voice shaking. He named a price—high, but I didn’t care. I shoved cash through the gap, avoiding his eyes. He counted it slowly, one bill at a time, his fingers smudged with grease. “You’re lucky I came by,” he said, looking at me too long. “Lots of types out here. Not all of ’em are good.” His smile was thin, like he knew a secret. I mumbled thanks and shut the door, sliding the deadbolt hard.He walked back to his truck, but before he climbed in, he stopped, staring at the RV. His flashlight clicked off, and for a second, I thought I saw another figure in the dark, just beyond his truck. My breath stopped. Was someone else out there? He didn’t seem to notice, or maybe he did and didn’t care. His engine roared, and his taillights faded into the night. But the feeling of eyes on me stayed.I didn’t move for hours. Every sound—a scrape, a rustle, a faint tap on the RV’s side—made me jump. I kept the knife close, imagining him coming back, or worse, someone he’d called. My mind played tricks: was that a footstep? A hand brushing the window? I checked the locks again, my hands trembling so bad I dropped the knife once. The new tire held, but I didn’t trust it—or him. What if he’d done something to it? What if he was waiting down the road?When the sky finally lightened, I started the RV, my hands still shaking. The engine coughed but caught, and I drove fast, eyes glued to the rearview mirror. Nothing followed, but I couldn’t shake the fear, like the desert itself was holding its breath. I reached the town, found a mechanic, and had every inch of that tire checked. It was fine, but I wasn’t. His words echoed: “Not all of ’em are good.” I never drove that road again, and I never forgot how close I felt to something I couldn’t name.

  


# ""Red X"":

My husband, David, and I had been crisscrossing the country in our RV, ""Wanderer,"" for three weeks, chasing the open road. We’d seen mountains, deserts, and forests, but we craved something quieter—a secluded beach in Texas, far from crowded campgrounds. The GPS led us down a narrow, unpaved road to a stretch of coastline near Padre Island, where the sand stretched endless and empty. It felt perfect, until the RV coughed, shuddered, and died. I turned the key again and again—nothing. David popped the hood, cursing softly. “Battery’s dead,” he said, wiping sweat from his brow. We checked our phones. No bars. The satellite phone we’d bought for emergencies? Left on our kitchen counter back home. My stomach twisted as the sky darkened, shadows creeping over the dunes.We stood by the RV, debating what to do. No cars had passed in hours. The beach was a mile from the nearest road, and walking in the dark felt like asking for trouble. Headlights flickered in the distance, growing brighter. Relief washed over me, but it was short-lived. An old pickup truck, rusted and rattling, pulled up. A heavyset man climbed out, his flannel shirt stained with grease. “Y’all stuck?” he called, his voice friendly but loud. A woman, thin and pale, stayed by the passenger door, her eyes scanning us. He introduced himself as Tom; she was Anna. Something about her stare—sharp, unblinking—made my skin crawl. “Battery’s gone,” David said, gesturing to the hood. Tom ambled over, peering at the engine. “Yup, dead as can be. I got a CB radio in the truck. Can call for a tow, but ain’t nobody coming out here till morning.”“Morning?” My voice cracked. Anna spoke up, her tone flat, almost bored. “Roadside folks don’t drive these parts at night. Too far out.” Tom nodded, scratching his beard. “Y’all can wait in your RV, but it’s safer at our camp. Got a fire, food. Just up the beach.” David squeezed my hand, his eyes asking what I thought. I didn’t trust them, but staying alone, exposed, felt worse. “Okay,” I said, forcing a smile. “Thanks.” We grabbed our backpacks, locked the RV, and followed their truck, its taillights glowing red through the dust.Their campsite was a quarter-mile away, tucked behind a dune. A small fire crackled, surrounded by a sagging tent, a cooler, and two folding chairs. A tarp covered a pile of gear—boxes, ropes, and what looked like a gas can. Tom tossed a log on the fire, sparks snapping into the air. “Sit,” he said, pointing to the chairs. Anna pulled out a pot and started heating canned beans, her movements quick and mechanical. “This beach has stories,” Tom said, settling into a chair with a creak. “Folks come here, camp, and poof—gone. Locals say it’s cursed.” Anna shot him a glance, her lips tight. I forced a laugh. “Just stories, right?” Tom’s grin widened, showing crooked teeth. “Sure. Just stories.”We ate the beans in silence, the fire’s heat doing little to ease the chill in my bones. Anna barely spoke, her eyes flicking between us and the darkness. Every rustle in the dunes made me jump. Tom kept talking, his voice too loud, about campers who vanished, their RVs found empty, wallets and gear missing. “Probably wandered off, got lost,” he said, but his eyes lingered on us, like he was testing our reactions. Anna stood abruptly, muttering about checking the tent. Her shadow moved inside, and I caught her glancing back, her face half-lit, expressionless.After dinner, Tom offered us sleeping bags to crash by the fire. “Safer than walking back,” he said. David nodded, but I saw the tension in his jaw. We lay down, the fire’s glow fading to embers. I couldn’t sleep, my heart pounding. David’s breathing slowed, but I stayed alert, staring at the stars. Then, whispers drifted from the tent. I held my breath, straining to hear. “...too nosy,” Tom hissed. “They saw the map.” Anna’s voice was low. “Get it done before the tow comes. Clean.” My blood ran cold. Map? What map? I nudged David, my hand shaking. His eyes snapped open. “Listen,” I whispered, barely audible. “They’re planning something.”We waited, pretending to sleep, until the whispers stopped. The tent zipper rasped, and Anna’s silhouette slipped out, heading toward the truck. I grabbed David’s arm. “We need to check the RV. Now.” We crept away, using the dunes for cover, the sand muffling our steps. The RV loomed ahead, its door slightly ajar. My heart sank. Inside, our bags were torn open—wallets gone, clothes scattered. I swept my flashlight across the floor and froze. Under the driver’s seat, a hunting knife glinted, its blade etched with scratches. Not ours. Tucked beside it was a folded map, marked with red Xs along the coast. A newspaper clipping slipped out, its headline screaming: “Couple Vanishes from Texas Beach, RV Found Abandoned.” My hands shook so hard I dropped the flashlight.“They did this,” I whispered, voice breaking. David’s face was pale, his eyes wide. “The battery—it wasn’t dead. They cut the cables.” He pointed to the frayed wires under the dash. Footsteps crunched outside, heavy and deliberate. “Y’all okay in there?” Tom’s voice, too close, sent ice down my spine. We ducked behind the counter, my pulse hammering. The door creaked wider, and Tom stepped in, his boots scuffing the floor. A pistol gleamed in his hand, catching the moonlight. “Come out,” he said, his tone no longer friendly. “We need to talk.” Anna appeared behind him, holding a flashlight, her face a mask of calm.David gripped a wrench from the toolbox, his knuckles white. I fumbled in a drawer, my fingers closing around our flare gun. “Stay back,” I shouted, aiming it at Tom. He laughed, a low, ugly sound. “You ain’t got the guts, lady.” He stepped closer, raising the pistol. David lunged, swinging the wrench. It cracked against Tom’s forearm, and the gun skidded across the floor. Anna screamed, rushing me, her nails clawing at my arm. I stumbled back, aimed the flare gun skyward, and pulled the trigger. A red streak roared into the sky, bursting like a scream.Tom tackled David, fists slamming into his ribs. I grabbed a frying pan from the counter, swinging it at Anna’s shoulder. She yelped, falling back, her flashlight rolling across the floor. David wrestled Tom to the ground, pinning his arms. Headlights flashed outside—a park ranger’s truck, tires crunching sand. “Freeze!” a voice bellowed. A ranger burst in, gun drawn, his flashlight blinding. Tom and Anna froze, their faces twisting in rage. “Drop the wrench!” the ranger ordered. David obeyed, hands up. I spilled everything—the cut cables, the stolen wallets, the knife, the map, the clipping. The ranger’s eyes narrowed as he cuffed Tom and Anna, radioing for backup.At the ranger station, we learned the truth. Tom and Anna were wanted for a string of robberies along the coast, targeting RVers in remote spots. Their truck held stolen gear—jewelry, cash, even a watch matching a missing camper’s description. The map’s red Xs marked their hits, and the clipping was one of many they kept, like trophies. The ranger confirmed our battery cables were sliced clean, a trap to keep us stranded. “You’re lucky,” he said. “That flare saved your lives. Another hour, and…” He didn’t finish.David and I don’t camp remote anymore. We got Wanderer fixed, but every creak of its frame reminds me of that night—their fake smiles, the whispers, the glint of that knife. I still see Anna’s cold stare in my nightmares, hear Tom’s laugh. We were minutes from becoming another headline, another X on their map. Now, we stick to crowded campgrounds, keep a charged satellite phone, and trust no one offering help on a lonely road. Freedom’s not worth that kind of fear.",1,1749780363.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

I've been dialing my Flair Pro2 and Kingrinder K6 for the past few days. The shots were either too fast or too slow, and grinding light roast coffee with a hand grinder is really painful. After days of torture and running out of beans, I bought some dark roast espresso beans from a local roaster, and recalibrated my grinder since I used the drill yesterday and it sorta changed the zero point.

And it finally WORKED. I used 18g beans and 30 clicks, water temp 92C. Following the process I read online, I pre-infuse at 2-3 bar for about 10s until liquid dropped, then add to 5-6 bar and hold it until the total liquid weight is \~2/3 of expected weight, about 28g. Then bring the pressure back to 2-3 bar until 42g. I was so happy because this time I can actually control the pressure to stay at the sweet spot.

The results was astonishingly good. When I drank the espresso, it was so sweet and round and balanced I couldn't believe I actually made it. Added 70g milk to the rest after first sip, and the result is still good. I'm just so happy I finally made a decent shot!",2,1749780315.0,FlairEspresso,2,1.0,False

# ❗Please do not look if you wish to remain unspoiled! ❗

>>!Episode opens on George out west. He’s meeting a go between and wants to buy land from a bunch of miners. He wants the land, not the mines but the miners are insisting on a meeting. !<

>>!It seems like it’s March 1884. There’s a snow storm but several characters remark that it should be spring by now “cherry blossoms not snowstorms” which implies early March. There’s a snow fight. Larry and Gladys go out for a walk but it’s really subterfuge for Gladys to meet Billy. Billy wants to marry her and she says she loves him but won’t tell her mother until her father is back from out west. She assures Billy that her father will support them. !<

>>!Agnes and Ada are in a full blown battle for control. Ada is hosting temperance people. Agnes refuses to let them use her silver, etc. Many good one liners for Agnes and the Q&A after had strong implications that the fights only get worse as time goes on. They do have some touching moments together too, but mostly it’s a big sisterly battle for control. !<

>>!Oscar is annoyed that Ada thinks he should work for money. He spends most of his days laying around and drinking right now, but in the trailer for the rest of the season he seems to get back in touch with his old boyfriend who implies he’ll help him. !<

>>!Jack gets warned that he’s acting above his station by Adelheid after a footman at the Russell house is forced by Larry to serve Jack coffee. Larry seems to be helping him with the clock but also wants to take all the first meetings himself without Jack, even though Larry (bless him) cannot identify a damn thing about the invention drawings. !<

>>!Bertha talks with Singer Sargent while he starts Gladys’s painting. They discuss his recent work Madame X the scandal of which Bertha says will only drive up his prices (she also describes the painting in a way that felt super gay to me which I loved). Sargent says that he wishes he had her confidence. Bertha replies that she wishes she’d had her confidence when she was his age. !<

>>!Gladys is learning how to play her mother’s game (a little). Larry’s heading to the opera and Bertha forbids Gladys to go. Gladys replies that surely Bertha would like her to be nice to her duke when he comes to stay soon? Bertha glares and agrees Gladys can go. !<

>>!At the opera Billy and Gladys sit together in Mrs. FIsh’s box. Mrs. Fish and Billy’s mother chat about Billy’s intention to marry Gladys. Mrs. Fish is skeptical and implies Bertha’s someone to be reckoned with. This proves true in a later scene with both women are at the Russells house for a Met event. Mrs. Carlton says that she and Bertha will soon have something else to celebrate other than the Met’s success and will be toasting an engagement perhaps? Bertha shuts her down HARD and later speaks to Larry about it all. Bertha’s definitely Queen Bee at the moment, in a way she hasn’t been in Season 1 or 2 (though clearly wanted to be). Mrs. Fish seems almost afraid of her at times. !<

>>!Meanwhile Aurora never makes it to the opera because Charles comes home late to tell her he’s been cheating on her with a widow and wants Aurora to divorce him. Aurora doesn’t want to divorce him because it will ruin her life. He doesn’t seem to care. Aurora’s not wrong though, later when she tells Agnes, Ada, and Marian about the divorce Agnes implies it’s true that Aurora wouldn’t be invited even to her own dinner parties (“she might prefer to come to dinner alone”) and Ada doesn’t disagree. (Marian looks askance.) !<

>>!Ada suggests to Marian that Larry come to dinner to try to inspire Oscar to have more of a spirit of hard work. This does not work, but does lead to some cute moment for the couple. Notably however, they’re not a couple yet. In an earlier scene Marian asks Larry to be patient with things. She’s only recently broke off her engagement and wants to stay out of the limelight. He agrees and later confesses his love for Marian to Gladys, just as Marian confesses her love of Larry to Peggy. !<

>>!Peggy meanwhile is very ill. She comes to help with the temperance meeting and ends up bedridden for the episode. Agnes calls a white Doctor but he refuses to see Peggy after coming, so they call for Peggy’s parents. !<

>>!Gladys and Bertha have a full blown fight in Bertha’s bedroom. Bertha thinks she’s childish and foolish. Gladys insists she knows her own mind and is an adult. Bertha thinks Billy is generally useless and to be the Duchess of Buckingham would be amazing. Gladys, furious, packs a bag and fleas the house. Larry earlier implied that perhaps she and Billy should elope? The episode ends with her running away into the night. !<",20,1749780236.0,thegildedage,9,1.0,False

1la4ajh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmltheAsshoIe/comments/1la4ajh/my_friend_exchanged_a_group_of_close_friends_for/,My friend exchanged a group of close friends for a girl and does not understand what he is to blame for and why he lost all his friends.,"The story will be quite long, I tried to explain everything clearly, I hope you will understand me (all names will be changed for anonymity purposes). And so I want to start by saying that I have a friend - let it be Jan. At one point, Jan began to walk less with the company (in total, we have 2 companies- ours (it consists of my boyfriend Artem, my two best friends Medi and Clara, and Jan himself) and a second company consisting of about 13 people, I will call this company ""volleyball players"" because we often play all together in volleyball. The man began to walk more with his new friends, let them be Misha and Dasha. Jan liked Dasha and Misha, too. Misha asked Jan from the very beginning if he would mind if he confessed to Dasha, which Jan did not mind. After that, Ian himself was the first to come up and confessed his feelings to Dasha. Jan officially left our company ""volleyball players"", did not warn anyone, just silently took and left there. I wrote to Jan, ""Jan, you're acting like a complete asshole, you're changing your close friends for bad company, for Misha (whom even my boyfriend has stopped communicating with, even though they've known each other since childhood and have been friends for 8 years), and Dasha (a former friend with whom they just changed interests and decided to stop communication, and later Dasha calls me names (to this day)."" To which Jan later told me that I was giving him a choice, that I shouldn't actually do that, and best friends don't do that (we've known each other for almost 3 years, their mothers were friends with Medi, and they've known Artyom for 2-3 years for sure). We decided to sort out the situation, the Media gathered everyone in our place (including our company ""volleyball players""), all the people came and the showdown began. I talked to Jan separately and explained that he had no choice, and that's why I told him that if he adopted the behavior of these people, we would stop communicating because I didn't like them. After that, I asked, ""do you have any more questions for me?"" to which the man replied, ""No, there aren't any."" After that, he went to Misha, talked to him, and he started complaining about me again. I once again walked away and talked to him separately, we agreed on the understanding of my words, and I added that it was time for Jan to make any decisions on his own and think for himself, so that next time he could answer for himself and not someone else for him. Later it turns out that after this conversation in the coffee, Dasha told Jan to ""stop talking to them."" Dasha and Medi also talked that day and agreed on their opinions, in the end they held out their hands to each other and said that name-calling from one side would be hypocrisy. Over time, Jan began to drift away. After that, he and I had a quarrel, because Clara and I approached him and talked about how it would not be bad for us to go for a walk at 3 (me, Jan and Clara), which Jan was busy all week ahead (although it was not typical for him and he could always combine communication between people). I freaked out, my conversations with the man were not heard, I left there and started crying. After this act, the person received 2 blunders (in my understanding, 3 blunders are the cessation of communication). I want to make it clear right away that mistakes are credited for serious human mistakes that I myself consider wrong in relation to me, the first mistake was a long time ago). We talked, I said that I didn't want to go out anymore and we didn't communicate with him that day anymore. The next day, I informed him about the 2 miss (he is aware of the 3 miss rule). To which he indignantly told me why I gave it to him, I explained - he understood. Then there was another situation when Jan called me names in correspondence when we were talking with him. I didn't like it because she's my close friend, so I explained everything clearly to Jan, and we had a fight, but he understood. Misha doesn't communicate with them anymore, they stopped communicating because of Jan's act with Dasha. Now we have agreed to meet on the 18th (everyone was free that day and it was the perfect date for everyone to get together and discuss everything).

On average my ZZZ builds spend more days cooking in the mines than my HSR or Genshin ones, even hyper-relying on the music vendor, but the ratios seem absolutely awful by comparison.

Examples: 

My Evelyn (80cr/113cd) can't get above 110-120ish cdmg for the life of me, and I literally don't have a cdmg% mainstat piece that rolled more than once into cr% even though I've spent an eternity farming discs; not even offpieces. Her 2p's are so bad that I literally get more crit ratio just going 2 random pieces for the last slots. (Brimstone wengine)

My Ellen, being my oldest character, barely scrapes by at 76/131 currently, before today it was 78/125. (no crit weapon)

Recently my Yixuan managed to get a 80/110 ratio with a temporary 2p/2p combo but again, it seems awfully low.

My Ellen seems fine by me for my ZZZ standards but on Genshin or HSR my DPS usually reach well above 200 cdmg% in most cases unless I don't run a crit mainpiece. A 120%-ish cdmg build I usually reach by accident with random supports while not even going for crit subs, and in ZZZ I can barely push past it.

I'd honestly appreciate some example ratios to reference, not including 5-critroll godpiece builds, of course.

I got two recently that make me chuckle, and also prove that some people always have someone to complain about, but they still gave me 10s, so like I'm not mad. But definitely baffled. Especially because surveys go out a day later, and most people aren't filling them out the same day they get them.

The first said I needed to be more professional, because professionals don't say things like ""easy peazy lemon squeezy"". Now I've probably said that across all my jobs (all customer service based) over the last decade or more. I've definitely worked with a manager who has said it before too. It just baffled me that someone felt strongly enough to say something about it. But some people don't like fun energy so like, I get it, someone was bound to be annoyed eventually.

The other though is the one that truly baffled me. As someone in service, we usually try to fill the awkward silence of the transaction waiting for the program to load, etc. especially since In my line, they really care about building member relationships and trust, I'll usually do the friendly conversation. Including just asking if they have anything going on for the rest of the day. Very basic question. I know I get asked regularly at the coffee shop.

But turning that ad into a real, on-brand creative is a whole other task: you have to write a brief, explain the ""vibe"" to a designer, and hope they get it right.

And that's how your 'Ad Inspiration' folder becomes a digital graveyard where great ideas go to die.

Well, we got sick of that loop. So we built a feature that makes your swipe file obsolete.

# Introducing: Create from the Inspiration Library

Instead of just screenshotting ads, you can now legally 'remix' them for your brand.

**Here’s how it works:** You browse ads in our Inspirations tab—a massive library of high-performing ads. When you find one you like, you just hover and click **'Create a Similar Ad.'**

That’s it.

The AI instantly understands the layout, structure, and style of that ad. It then takes you to our Composer where you feed it your product info and brand assets.

In seconds, comes out out a variety of on-brand creatives that follow the same winning formula.

You just skipped the entire creative briefing and design process, and went from ""Ooh, I like that ad"" to ""Here are 4 on-brand versions to test"" in less time than it takes to make coffee.

Finally, your inspiration can do something besides collect digital dust.

She was someone I once imagined would be in my bridal party — we’ve been close for a long time. I’ve driven over an hour to see her, spent time with her family, invited her to stay with me so we could hang out, and always tried to maintain the friendship by checking in and showing up for her.

Here’s where I’m struggling: every time I check in, she’ll vent or talk about what’s going on in her life, but never really asks about me. If I try to share something — especially about my relationship — she’ll often respond in an extremely harsh or blunt way. I get that she’s a straightforward person, but after 8 years of friendship, I feel like she should know me well enough to realize I’m more sensitive and deserve a little more care in how things are said.

The last straw for me was my 30th birthday. I’m not someone who expects a big deal from friends, but I was hoping she’d want to grab lunch or coffee — just something small to celebrate. Instead, she texted me that day but focused mostly on her own birthday and the plans she was making. I reminded her I’d love to celebrate together, and she invited me to something she planned for herself, even though she knew I had already invited her to something that day (which she declined). I ended up crying on my birthday, feeling really let down.

She said we’d celebrate later, but I didn’t hear from her for months. Then just this past week, she asked to see me this weekend — which I couldn’t do — and I asked her for other dates. She never replied.

I’m tired of putting in the effort. I constantly engage with her content (Instagram, TikTok, etc.) but she never checks in with me. She doesn’t know what’s happening in my life because she never asks. And honestly, the reason I don’t feel like I can have a conversation with her is that anytime I’ve brought up being upset in the past, she’s responded harshly or defensively. I can’t imagine how she’d react if I said, “Hey, you made me feel really hurt and unseen.”

I don’t feel safe being that vulnerable with her anymore. I don’t want to open up just to be shut down or invalidated — again. So part of me thinks it’s better just to step away without a confrontation. But part of me wonders… would I be the asshole for doing that?",22,1749779231.0,AITAH,31,1.0,False

""Seriously? You're worked up about him shaving?"" my best friend Lucy let out an exasperated laugh. ""Since when is that a crime?""  
  
""He never shaves at night,"" I said quietly.  
  
""Oh come on, maybe he had a dinner meeting!""  
  
I shook my head firmly.  
  
""Lucy, you know Nathan. Home by seven, lights out by eleven - the man runs like clockwork. He hasn't done a business dinner in years.""  
  
""Right, because he's too busy being madly in love with you,"" Lucy countered, her expression softening. ""Emma, please tell me you're not actually worried about this?""  
  
I caught myself and managed a small laugh.  
  
""Of course not.""  
  
As if on cue, my phone lit up with Nathan's call.  
  
""Sweetheart, Jenny mentioned you hardly touched your lunch. I've had Mark pick up some of your favorites from Bella's Kitchen. Get some food in you, take a little walk before your nap - and hey, I grabbed us tickets to that new Broadway show you've been wanting to see.""  
  
His voice carried that gentle warmth he reserved just for me, like someone speaking to their most precious person in the world.  
  
Lucy was listening in, shaking her head in disbelief.  
  
""God, if anyone at Pierce & Associates could hear their ice-cold CEO right now...""  
  
I couldn't blame her amazement. The Nathan Pierce that everyone else knew was all sharp suits and sharper decisions, the ruthless Wall Street legend who'd built an empire before forty. Sure, people knew he was devoted to his wife - but they had no idea just how deep that devotion ran.  
  
We'd been together for ten years, married for five, and this tender, attentive version of Nathan had always been mine alone. He could recite my coffee order in his sleep, knew exactly which designer's new collection would catch my eye, could tell from a single text if I was having a rough day...  
  
Last summer, I stormed out after a fight about his overprotective streak. Spent the night at The Plaza. When I came home the next morning, I found him on our living room couch, still in yesterday's suit, looking like he'd aged years overnight. The moment he saw me, he crossed the room in three strides and pulled me close, his voice breaking: ""I'm so sorry, baby. Never again.""  
  
Then there was that weekend at the Hamptons last year. Our vacation villa caught fire while he was out grabbing my favorite ice cream. He tried to charge into the burning building - it took three security guards and the local firefighters to hold him back. Only when he heard me screaming his name from the pool house did he stop fighting them, his designer suit singed and smoking.  
  
He still has a scar above his eyebrow from that night. Every time I see it, my heart twists, but he just gives me that soft smile and says, ""My battle scar from being Emma Pierce's hero.""  
  
That's the thing about Nathan's love for me. It's my constant, my true north - more reliable than gravity itself.  
  
And God knows I love him just as fiercely.  
  
Which is exactly why something as small as him shaving before bed...  
  
I noticed it instantly.  
  


Chapter 2

They say Cancers are born worriers. Mix that with my mom's perfectionist DNA, and you've got someone who sees a red flag in every tiny change to routine.  
  
Normally when a guy shaves at night, he's heading to a business dinner. But Nathan? He's got his routine down to a science - dinner at one of his regular spots, then straight home. No cocktail hours, no networking events, nothing.  
  
So what could possibly make Manhattan's most powerful CEO break his golden rule? Was there some crisis at Pierce & Associates he was shielding me from?  
  
I had to see for myself. If everything was fine, great. If not, we'd face it together.  
  
I called Sarah. We'd been roommates all through Harvard, and now she was CFO at Pierce & Associates. Back when her family lost everything in the 2008 crash, I'd helped her get back on her feet and convinced Nathan to give her a shot at the firm.  
  
She practically sprinted across the marble lobby when she saw me.  
  
""Emma!"" She pulled me into a hug before whisking me toward the private elevator. ""You need to visit more often! The whole office lights up when you're here. Even Nathan's death glare takes a vacation.""  
  
I couldn't help but smile. ""Everything okay around here lately?""  
  
""Better than okay - huge news!""  
  
""What?"" My stomach dropped.  
  
""We doubled our profits! Everyone's getting massive bonuses!"" Sarah's whole face lit up. That's what I've always loved about her - life knocked her down hard, but she never lost that sparkle.  
  
Nathan was stuck in meetings, so Sarah walked me to his corner office. As we passed the executive floor, I noticed a cluster of unfamiliar faces - all young, female, and looking like they'd stepped off a magazine cover.  
  
A nasty little thought crept in: Was this why he'd suddenly started caring about evening grooming?  
  
I immediately felt sick at myself. This was Nathan Pierce, for God's sake. The same man who'd hosted the Miss Manhattan pageant at our venue and spent the whole evening answering work emails in his office.  
  
""You okay? You've got that look,"" Sarah nudged me.  
  
I bit my lip. ""New assistants?""  
  
""What? Oh - the PR team. Business is booming, so Nathan set up a dedicated external relations department. His idea, actually - said it was the only way to keep his promise about being home for dinner every night.""  
  
She gave me that knowing look. ""Emma Pierce, you were literally on Vanity Fair's '30 Under 30' list. Are you seriously worried about the PR girls?""  
  
""I know, I know, I'm being ridiculous,"" I laughed weakly.  
  
Sarah squeezed my arm. ""Your overthinking is going to give you premature wrinkles. Relax - they handle client events. Nathan barely knows their names.""  
  
After she left, I sank into Nathan's chair, staring at the gallery of our photos on his desk. Photos from our vineyard wedding, our Amalfi Coast anniversary, casual shots of me laughing in Central Park...  
  
So the company was thriving. No other woman. Maybe he just got a fancy new electric razor from his Birchbox. Maybe he just felt like it.  
  
Lucy and Sarah kept telling me if I hadn't married someone as steady as Nathan, my anxiety would've landed me in therapy years ago.  
  
Then came a soft knock.  
  
A woman entered, head slightly bowed, setting down a cup of artisan tea with picture-perfect precision.  
  
""Mrs. Pierce, please don't hesitate if you need anything else.""  
  
My blood ran cold.  
  
Claire Morrison. Nathan's executive assistant.  
  
I hadn't expected to see her.  
  
She was still here.  
  


Chapter 3

A few years ago, Nathan came home looking like he'd seen a ghost. I knew something was wrong the moment he walked through our apartment door.  
  
He sat on our Italian leather sofa for what felt like hours before he finally spoke. He'd run into the family of the drunk driver who killed his parents.  
  
The accident happened when Nathan was at Harvard. His parents were stopped at a red light on the Mass Pike when a drunk driver plowed into them at full speed. All three died instantly.  
  
Claire Morrison was that driver's daughter.  
  
Nathan had discovered this three months after his HR team hired her as his executive assistant.  
  
I'd never seen him so shaken - his hands trembling, eyes bloodshot. ""Emma, I can't... every time I see her, all I can think about is that night. Sometimes I just want to..."" His voice cracked. This was Nathan Pierce - the man who could make or break companies without blinking - completely undone.  
  
I pulled him close, running my fingers through his hair. ""Hey, it's okay. You don't have to handle this alone. You can have HR transfer her, give her a great recommendation.""  
  
That was the first time I'd ever seen the ruthless CEO of Pierce & Associates break down like a lost child, holding onto me like I was his anchor to reality.  
  
When I carefully broached the subject a few weeks later, he seemed back to his usual composed self.  
  
""I had her moved to Operations on a different floor.""  
  
""Why keep her at all? Are you sure you're okay with this?""  
  
His expression was surprisingly peaceful. ""You were right - I can't let the past control me forever. Maybe this is my chance to grow beyond it. I'm fine, really.""  
  
After that, during my occasional office visits, Claire vanished from sight. Nathan never mentioned her again. I thought he'd finally found his peace with it.  
  
Until today, when she walked into his corner office.  
  
""I thought Melissa was your assistant now?""  
  
Claire gave that nervous smile she'd perfected. ""She's on maternity leave. A few of us from Operations are rotating coverage.""  
  
""That must be quite the adjustment,"" I said diplomatically.  
  
Claire Morrison wasn't exactly Manhattan executive material. Small-boned, almost delicate, with plain features and off-the-rack clothes. She had this permanent deer-in-headlights look - like someone who spent their life trying not to be noticed.  
  
She dipped her head slightly. ""Mrs. Pierce, I should get back to the front desk.""  
  
As she turned, I caught sight of something on her neck - several distinctive red marks.  
  
Unmistakably hickeys.  
  
Nathan returned from his board meeting looking every inch the power player in his bespoke Tom Ford suit.  
  
He leaned against the doorframe of his office, just watching me with that smile that still made my heart skip. ""Finally decided to grace Pierce & Associates with your presence?""  
  
I walked over and slipped into his arms. ""Maybe I should visit more often. Your entire staff lights up when I'm here.""  
  
He tweaked my nose playfully. ""They better not light up too much.""  
  
I chose my next words carefully. ""Claire brought me coffee earlier.""  
  
He stilled for a moment before managing a quiet ""Mm.""  
  
""She's filling in as your assistant. Nathan, you don't have to explain - I know you've worked through this.""  
  
I looked up at him. ""Mom always said you had incredible resilience. Look at you now - running this empire, handling everything so perfectly. She knew exactly what you'd become.""  
  
His dark eyes held mine for a long moment before he bent to brush his lips against my forehead.  
  
""Emma,"" he murmured against my skin, ""that's all because of you.""

1la3z9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BesteverAI/comments/1la3z9m/what_do_you_do_when_you_see_a_killer_ad_your_ad/,What do you do when you see a killer ad? Your ad swipe file is useless. This new Bestever AI feature turns inspiration into actual ads in 60 seconds.,"We all do it. See a killer ad, screenshot it, and think, ""We should do something like this.""

But turning that ad into a real, on-brand creative is a whole other task: you have to write a brief, explain the ""vibe"" to a designer, and hope they get it right.

And that's how your 'Ad Inspiration' folder becomes a digital graveyard where great ideas go to die.

Well, we got sick of that loop. So we built a feature that makes your swipe file obsolete.

# Introducing: Create from the Inspiration Library

  
Instead of just screenshotting ads, you can now legally 'remix' them for your brand.

**Here’s how it works:** You browse ads in our Inspirations tab—a massive library of high-performing ads. When you find one you like, you just hover and click **'Create a Similar Ad.'**

That’s it.

The AI instantly understands the layout, structure, and style of that ad. It then takes you to our Composer where you feed it your product info and brand assets.

In seconds, comes out out a variety of on-brand creatives that follow the same winning formula.

You just skipped the entire creative briefing and design process, and went from ""Ooh, I like that ad"" to ""Here are 4 on-brand versions to test"" in less time than it takes to make coffee.

Finally, your inspiration can do something besides collect digital dust.

It's something that makes me feel like a 'normal' drinker. It lasts for an hour and it satisfies. I know that I'm going to leave when it's finished and move on with the rest of the day/evening.

I know it isn't for everyone but people watching and soaking in the ambience of a cozy pub waa always the real reason for me drinking in the first place. I genuinely don't like the feeling of losing my cognitive functions to alcohol and never really did. 

I believe it was once the anaesthetic effects took place that things became 'interesting' a few litres later.

No diuretic is also a bonus unlike some other soft drinks or coffee. But Aa would laugh at this or say I wasn't a real alcoholic to begin with, or even worse. That I was killing people.

Airport prices are insane so I limit myself to the one item, did not even have a cup of coffee. I even put a dollar in the tip cup, don’t ask me why.  You hand me a croissant, I pay for the croissant,  for what am I tipping you?  But you know that guilty feeling you get now if you don’t tip for everything. So I sit down to eat it and I see they charged me, with no notice or asking permission, an additional 3% for an “employee benefits and retention surcharge”. Which by the way they follow up by saying this is not a tip and it does not go directly to the staff.  Well what the hell is it then? Who gets it?  It‘s not even optional and I wasn’t notified.  It’s just there on the receipt.  Yes It’s only a few cents, because I was alone and had one item.  What if I was with my family and we all had a full lunch?  Since when is the customer forced to pay for a company to retain its employees and pay their benefits?   This is BS

Ive been doing great and cherishing my very few, genuine friendship circle until my child started school this year in a totally different state as we just moved up here a few months ago.

My child is much more social than me and has a couple of besties thank goodness. The mums of my child's friends know me and each other. They put the effort to be early to both school drop off and pick ups for some parenting chit chat, etc

As a good introvert I avoid small talk like the plague XD although I know that's the only way I can get deeper in friendships down the track..oh dear..

The other mums are now a tight circle since our kids play with each other well. I eventually force myself to chat to them, more in a one on one setting of course, and am friendly and have had good, lengthy chats.

Nowadays when i get to the school they are now always together chatting. Sometimes I know they've seen me, but I can also see they look at me then turn their heads and keep on chatting amongst themselves like I am invisible. Sometimes I pass by some of then and say ""morning, or hi"" and they sometimes just throw me a somewhat awkward smile only (no greeting at all) or totally ignore me oO

I have now started to ignore them as well, passing by and making myself busy with my other little one or something else..

How awkward!!! If I am chatting to someone and I see another person who I know I always wave a ""hi"" from distance, or say ""morning"" and keep on chatting as that is not hard! Or I also try to include people, introduce them to each other, etc Since I know how bad it feels to be an outsider, I do my best to include everyone and love connecting people, and I would love to find another person who's like that too, but havent had any luc so far..haha

Im now starting to feel for my school kid as I have a feeling he is starting to miss playdates outside school, birthdays or get togethers with his buddies as ive been hearing the mums are getting together for coffees and playdates outside school ...

It hurts me to do that to my kid, but at the same time it's so painful to have to put the effort as they don't seem to be my tribe at all...argh!

I have this friend, she is a fellow hairstylist and she has been coming for me for free. She has been buying her own product and we have been going black for a while. 

Then she wanted a full checkerboard of black And vibrant red. A full head of colour blocking, and sectioning of a vibrant fashion red. This was only a couple months back. 

She is now coming to me for a full colour correction, she was a level 1N on top of a level 1N. Her appointments for the correction has been 5 hours each time per month, and she isnt accepting the fact that we are going to have to get there slowly if she wants to still have hair. We got her to a warm level 5, and she is now again pestering me for another service because she is saying its ""too coppery"" she wants to go for a level 6 gold but not red.

1la3umc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1la3umc/my_father_is_a_different_person_that_i_struggle/,My father is a different person that I struggle to accept,"My father is newly retired and seventy years old. We have had a great relationship that began after I was exiting my teens. We quickly became very good friends and have always been very open with each other.

A couple years ago I decided to make a short film about my mother who passed away when I was very young, from a drug overdose. It was obviously a very painful time for my father who was also using back then but I still expected him to be that open person.

To my surprise, I quickly began seeing my father exhibit brain blocks. Whenever I would ask him about the past, he would get lost in a sea of ""uh""s, as if his brain was short circuiting or subconsciously working hard to keep those memories blocked. It was a very frustrating time for us both, as I thought I was owed my mother's story and was angry with my father for ultimately not delivering the way I had hoped.

We eventually moved past this. I began to understand that this was a bigger issue with who my father has become overtime; that it wasn't just about my mother but rather his brain has become broken.

It is hard to explain what being around my father has become. He is still operating his day to day in a normal way but constantly darting, constantly getting distracted, and even physically jittering. Unless it's late at night and he's lost all his energy, he operates like a ball of nerves. He can't completely sit still.

He grabs at things as a tick, interrupts me sometimes, and just generally seems uncomfortable even though he would tell you he's fine. It can be very difficult to be around and sadly it makes me temperamental at times, snapping at him to relax. I don't do well at all around really anxious people.

I ultimately know that this is not something I can just be angry about, express to him, and then just like that he will change. I have actually suggested he stop drinking two large cups of coffee in the morning because I think it exacerbates his situation; and that maybe he should try meditation.

On top of this; he cannot do for himself. He wants to write; he can't. He wants to travel overseas; he finds excuses not to. He also grabs at his phone constantly, again, like a tick.

This is honestly really hard to convey completely. I just wish my father were stronger for himself. I wish he had a more confident stride and disposition. He just seems wound and uncomfortable. I sometimes wonder if it's legitimate adhd plus a fried brain. I really don't know. I want to stop getting angry at him. I want him to find some peace with himself.

It feels a bit like role reversal. I need help, advice; I don't know. I end up feeling like a terrible person when I snap. I get my anger from my mother. It's all f\*cked.

TLDR; My father has become very anxious and scatter brained in his older years and I struggle to help and be around it, to the point where I am mean to him. Need advice.",1,1749778578.0,AgingParents,3,1.0,False

1la3s45,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1la3s45,Kuršų Katės - Photos from a week in Lithuania and Latvia,"Mods deleted my last post because I tagged it ias a trip report and I did not include enough/any text lol, so I am happy to re-post with a bit more of a trip report.

*A couple of my friends wanted to get together for a weekend in Copenhagen, and I figured that while I was across the Atlantic, I might as well go to some places I'd never been before. 

*I didn't spend enough time anywhere and will have to go back someday, but I sometimes enjoy fast-paced solo travel and had a great time overall. This probably would have been a miserable trip for or with most anyone else, so I can't say I recommend this itinerary, but it worked for me. 

*I flew in and out of Riga, convenient SAS/AirBaltic codeshare and connection through Copenhagen 

*Basic Itinerary:

*Day 1 (26 May): Early morning flight from Copenhagen to Riga, drive to Klaipėda, overnight in Klaipėda. 
*Day 2: morning in Klaipėda, take ferry to Curonian Spit, overnight in Nida. 
*Day 3: Morning on Curonian Spit, then Drive to Kaunas along the Panemunė Road, overnight in Kaunas.
*Day 4: Drive to Vilnius via Trakai, overnight in Vilnius
*Day 5: in Vilnius. 
*Day 6: Drive to Riga with detours to Molėtai and Cesis
*Day 7: in Riga
*Day 8 (June 2): Fly home

*You may, as a matter of course, blame a German for convincing me that road-tripping is a good way to tour parts of Europe. The driving was fine, unremarkable for the most part except for the abundance of speed cameras, and the fact that they were apparently re-doing every road everywhere all at once in Vilnius so that was rough. I didn't drive much in the cities, just parked at the hotel and got about on foot. 

So, what did I do?

*1. I went to Kemeri Bog National Park and struggled to pay for parking without a European cell phone number or an eSim that included more than just data. The bog was awesome, saw lots of birds and bugs and a couple of lizards sunning themselves on the boardwalk. 

*2. I saw the Ventas Rumba, the widest waterfall in Europe, in Kuldīga. I also saw some fish jumping over the rapids. Got some coffee at the café featured in the first photo.

*3. I followed Google maps advice to take a ""shortcut"" around Liepaja, which actually turned out to be much longer because it was mostly a gravel road. Drove through some very rural areas, and saw a sign for a village called Rude, which I thought was funny, given the somewhat rude advice Google maps had just given me.

*4. I waited for 5 minutes near the Latvia/Lithuania border because only one lane of the road was open. Shortly thereafter I spotted a weird viking ship in a field in the fog as I drove towards Klaipėda. Anyone tell me what's up with that? 

*5. I had some delicious ¿cheese fingers? and pikeperch at a great restaurant in Klaipėda, and stayed at a hotel right next to the Black Ghost sculpture, because it was next to the ferry terminal. It turned out to not actually be the car ferry terminal I was meant to use the next day, but it was an excellent spot, would stay there again. 

*6. I found a photograph of my grandfather's uncle in the History Museum of Lithuania Minor in Klaipėda. Great museum, really enjoyed it. 

*7. I took the ferry over to the Curonian spit, climbed an exhausting dune, and had a nice afternoon on the beach in Nida, where I took the opportunity to moon Russia. Here I also saw a legless lizard, on the path in the forest. Tried šaltibarščiai, it was alright. I'm sorry, Lithuanians, but I can't stand the color, it reminds me too much of that amoxicillin shit. Flavor was fine, good even, but I had to close my eyes 😆

*8. I went to Kaunas but spent very little time in the city because I got distracted by too many castles and beautiful old churches along the road on the way there. Ate a good burger at a breaking-bad themed burger joint and wandered around the boulevard and cathedral and sculpture park during the long twilight hours. 

*9. I went to the Lithuanian Ethnographic Museum, climbed the observation tower overlooking the Kaunas lagoon, and saw some neat old furniture with joinery that reminded me of my grandfather's work. Had my first kibinai here. 

*10. I spent an afternoon in Trakai, visited the castles, got more kibinai.

*11. In Vilnius, I climbed up to the Gediminas Castle, walked around the old town, went to the Vilna Gaon Museum of Jewish History with a gallery of paintings by Samuel Bak a holocaust survivor from Vilnius who now lives within an hours drive of me in the US. Good art. 

*12. I also went to Užupis at the recommendation of a friend, ate cepelenai. Užupis was cool, got lots of cat related photos there. I was then convinced to go see King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard by some Finnish hipsters who'd traveled there for the show--I'd previously heard it was happening and was vaguely familiar with the band and the venue, Lukiškės Prison, sounded fucken cool, which it was. It was a good show--I went on the second of the three nights they played. I heard that it rained on the first night, which would have been a real bummer, dude. Got a Hesburger before the show, decent fast food burger. 

*13. I stopped for coffee in Molėtai, and because the nearby Ethnocosmology Museum would not open until a bit later in the day, I instead climbed the also nearby observation tower in Labanoras Park for a pretty excellent view and a little vertigo on the side. 

*14. I might have been yelled at by an automated security system when I crossed the Daugava at the hydroelectric dam, parked in the little parking area on the north bank, and walked onto the grass to try to get a nice photo of the dam; I am a bit of an infrastructure nerd so just thought the dam was cool, but I left immediately after the speakers started yelling. I am not a Russian spy, just a weird tourist who works with engineers.

*15. I went to Cesis Castle, which was probably the most unique and memorable castle I've ever visited (and I have visited a fair few) solely due to the fact that when you pay for entrance, they hand you a lantern with a candle and say ""you'll need this, it's dark in the towers,"" which it was. Good shit, 10/10.

*16. I had some great food at a restaurant in the countryside outside Sigulda, recommended by a local.  Fish stew, blood sausage, and some kind of pulled pork/barley pudding that was really good. As I was finishing dinner, the Cool Cars Club rolled up in their dozens and immediately occupied the parking lot and all of the other outdoor tables at the restaurant. Took me a while to pay lol but got to see and appreciate a few really nice sports cars, including a Lamborghini, a Maserati, and a McLaren, before I got back on the road to Riga in my rental car

*17. I learned how to use the Bolt scooters in Riga and had a great time scooting into and around the city from my cheap accomodations a few km from the center.

*18. I spent a couple of hours at the Museum of the Occupation of Latvia. Fantastic museum, very information-dense, learned a lot. Went to an upscale Italian restaurant for lunch because I had a hankering for pesto and they delivered. I googled up a good wine pairing and it worked pretty well. 

*19. Hesburger is an even better decent fast food burger after a couple two three beers. 

*20. Boarded my early morning flight out of Riga while reading the news about Ukraine's badass drone strikes in Russia. Mentally encouraged the pilots to hit the throttle.

Was wondering if someone has had similar experience and if they ended up having type 2 or if their numbers got better after time. I am going to get my bloodwork done soon. I had diet controlled gestational diabetes. I am slightly overweight with a bmi of 26.5. My numbers are worse now than when I was pregnant. 

I will be 4 months postpartum next week. I started checking my numbers out of curiosity and my fasting number is a bit high about half of the week around 5.8-6.0 (even if I ate super healthy the day before). I may get a normal fasting number 2-3 times a week. It also seems to take some time for my body to bring down my sugars if I had a treat or a carb heavy meal. For instance I had pizza tonight (3 slices unfortunately, I didn’t get a chance to eat much during the day due to being super busy, they were thin crust though) and it has been 3.5 hours I am still reading 7.2. 

With this being said, I am pretty sleep deprived (usually getting 4-5 hours a night. 3 on a bad, 6 on a good), and have a few stressors in my life at the moment causing me anxiety. I also am having 2-3 black coffees a a day (I take my fasting number before my coffee).

I am just wondering what other people’s experiences have been?",1,1749778148.0,GestationalDiabetes,0,1.0,False

I've tried tapering so carefully that I used a kitchen scale to measure out the instant coffee in grams, and managed to get down to about 2/3 my normal amount without headaches. Progress, right? But when I stayed on this reduced level for around SIX WEEKS, I was getting depression symptoms. I struggled to do anything at work, lost interest in my hobbies, etc. It was absolutely ridiculous with no sign of ever letting up. So I gave up. Day one of my old intake level and I was cured. All this over drinking 2/3 of a cup instead of 1 cup. I don't know how other people get lucky enough to quit in a single week.

I'm afraid if I ever tried going cold turkey I'd get the headaches \*and\* depression, potentially for months on end. I'd lose my job.

I don't want to be tied to this instant coffee habit forever. It's a pain in the ass when I'm traveling for work, it costs money, and I'm dependent on this product always being available and always having a means of heating up water before \~10 AM.

1la3iyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpellcasterReviews/comments/1la3iyu/success_adjacent_story_maybe/,Success adjacent story (maybe?),"Disclaimer: I’m not sure if this post will be approved because it’s not exactly a review. I tried posting it from a burner account so I can remain anonymous, but it never was approved and I think this is an important post to share. I will probably delete this later. 

I wanted to comment on my experience and what might be considered “success”. This might be more of a cautionary tale, you decide (I’m writing this on mobile so forgive the typos):

Like many here I have been dealing with a broken heart from a “right person wrong time” situation. Back in October/November I started seeing all the jokes on TikTok to “hire the Etsy witch”. I thought it was a silly thing to do. I never wanted to mess with free will, but because my connection was so positive, I felt OK entertaining this. I found one that was like $10 with positive reviews. Did it. Moved on with my life. Didnt think much about it. A few weeks after that, he reached out. We spoke on the phone for hours. Talked about maybe getting coffee. But… he had also met someone. So I fully started to crash out.

Then I went down the rabbit hole. Found a TikTok witch. She did a reading. It was very accurate. The energy was in my favor so she didn’t think I needed a full on love spell. We cast a sweetener spell. She said apples could be a sign things were working. Shortly after that, I was traveling and a flight attendant gave me a fruit plate for free- it was mainly apples. My mind was blown. He and I kept talking but still weren’t seeing eachother.

I went deeper down the rabbit hole. I found this subreddit. Bought a road opener spell from someone recommended here. At the same time someone connected me to someone for a love spell. I was addicted so I did that (later found out this person was probably a scam thanks to this group). Regardless- a few weeks after that, we were seeing each other and working things out. The other person was gone. My mind was blown.

One month back together-ish he started to get distant. Same problems as before (fear of commitment). We decided to take some time apart. I crashed out again. Bought a commitment spell from one of my previous casters. Nothing. Bought a reading from someone recommended from here. It didn’t resonate but they assured me this was future. Bought a communication spell from this same person. Nothing. Tried another caster that said we needed to clear the energy because I layered too much work and then do three different types of work. Nothing.

At this point I’m coming out of the haze and realize that:

1.	⁠Nothing is ever going to work if I don’t just chill and work with one person and wait for stuff to manifest
2.	⁠Maybe this is all sus in general, it’s such an easy thing to get played with because there never is a guarantee and so many caveats of people saying “oh well it didn’t work because YOU didn’t detach and wait for it manifest”

I decided to do a final Hail Mary- found one last caster. She did a consultation and analysis. Told me I needed to heal before any of this stuff could even maybe work. I got a heart healing spell from her. Weeks passed and I had no confirmation it was even done. Was a little frustrated, considered maybe I’d been scammed. Then one day at like 3am I woke up, wide awake, felt very well rested like I could start the day, but went back to sleep because, hello, it was 3. Started my day the next day and had an email from her- the spell had been cast late the night before and it was successful. Coincidence that I had also woken up that night at 3 am, feeling very rested? I don’t know, maybe. Ever since then I’ve felt lighter. No longer obsessed. More at peace. I still have feelings towards my sp and still miss him at times, but it doesn’t consume me like before. I don’t think I’m sad anymore. 

So I’m not sure where I stand on this stuff - maybe I’ve been scammed multiple times. Maybe they have worked. I’ll never really know. But cautionary tale- don’t get sucked into this rabbit hole because it is so easy to become obsessed and just start throwing away money $20 here, $50 there… it all adds up. Don’t let people prey on your broken heart, or anger, or fears.

1la3i6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1la3i6g/modifying_diet_for_cholesterol_control/,Modifying diet for cholesterol control,"Had my first physical in three years and my cholesterol is up: overall is 210 and LDL is 146.  Triglycerides and HDL are all good.   I’m otherwise healthy-BP and resting heart rate good, not obese, no other health conditions, gym 3 times a week, run 5 miles a week.  I believe that red meat/cold cuts are the culprit.  A typical day for me would look like this:


Black coffee (no sugar no cream) and water all day long


Breakfast typically 3 pan fried eggs (canola oil as non-stick) topped with spicy guacamole, a non fat vanilla yogurt and a couple of spoonfuls of peanut butter


I work from home primarily so I would usually just snack throughout the day on the following: cold cuts (pepperoni/salami) cheese, peanuts, apples, grapes.


Dinner would oftentimes be cooking myself a cheeseburger on the grill and eating it with salsa and spicy guacamole.  


Basically I try to eat primarily protein and moderate carbs and very little to no simple sugars, but obviously the reliance on cold cuts and red meat is a problem in terms of cholesterol.  I’ve already started by swapping out the cold cuts and cheese for canned tuna (in water) mixed with spicy guacamole.  Last night I grilled skinless chicken breasts in place of burgers.  

What I’m unsure about is the eggs (I’ve read a lot of conflicting information on eggs and cholesterol) and the peanuts/peanut butter as they do have a fair amount of saturated fat.  I’d be interested in some critique of my diet and insight on the connection between eggs and plant based saturated fats and cholesterol.

I hate the university I'm at and it's not a good fit for me academically or emotionally and I feel like I can't handle any more, but if I take any breaks or even reduce enrollment I lose my scholarship. What do I do?

I just finished my freshman year with decent grades (3.9 out of 4) and am working on my own guided research project in a genetics lab now, but I just can't take it right now. I know I love the subject I study and I'm *good* at it because I've taken coursework in it outside of college before, but I can't function. It's not the right time for me and it will be eventually, but I don't know if it's one of those ""if you're going through hell keep going"" type of thing or a ""drive with the check engine light flashing and see how far you get"" type of thing. Getting to now is a hell of a long story, but I went to a really good high school and worked hard but wasn't quite good enough to get into a decent college outright. I was given a guaranteed transfer option from my first-choice institution, but financial aid fell through this month and I couldn't go (>100k in loans). I didn't have a backup plan because I thought the college I was at would be tolerable, and I really don't know what to do. One of my parents has been having pretty significant health issues within the last half-year out of the blue and needs to retire and that's going to infinitely complicate financial status and potential aid for any future or further enrollment and how much they can help me. 

I ran myself into the ground both semesters to get good grades, and I hate college. I've only ever known to run myself into the ground, and my takeaway for something not working is to try even harder. I tried to make the best of it did the whole college schebang of joining clubs and whatnot to make friends and have fun, but nothing clicked and I couldn't handle it. It was a nightmare. I hated everyone and everything, and I've never felt more alone in my entire life. All I did was study or be incredibly anxious about failing while procrastinating, and I couldn't eat or sleep or do anything because I was so afraid of failing while hating what I was doing. I kept gagging when I tried to eat because it was just another task but if I had nothing but coffee all day by 2PM I'd be shaking so badly I could barely type. It took me a month and I'm a bit better, but I still can't sleep, and I'm incredibly worried about what I'm going to do with myself and I can't focus on anything. I'm not a bad student, but all joy I felt when learning is gone. I nearly failed the last two weeks of the semester across the board but had anticipated this happening and ""banked"" my grades so that I'd be fine. I didn't want to do that at all, but I couldn't get myself together. More of this is lined up for all future semesters. It's not that school is too hard, but I don't have any way to balance myself. I had a system going in both semesters and I wasn't happy in the slightest but I was functional and I had my life together but I couldn't keep up, think of a house of cards and the slight wind that blows them all down is being sick for two days or something.

The research lab I'm in is amazing and I cannot even begin to put into words how important their support because it's the closest thing to genuine unconditional support I've ever gotten before (story I think for another post). I screwed up, and they didn't care. They said that they understood, and that they wanted me to succeed no matter what. I know I want to be a scientist and I should be doing exactly what I love, but I can't get myself together and I can't focus. I need a break, but I can't take one. I can't stay at the current institution I'm in because other than the lab, there isn't anything there for me. I tried to make it work but man cannot subsist off of a laboratory alone and they don't have what I desperately need to succeed and be happy. 

I'm at a crossroads. I know that I'll still continue to be miserable at the current university and if I continue it's not going to get any better, but I'm so afraid of losing what I have if I try and stop. I can't keep doing this. I want to defer a year and I have a plan but really need to get it together so I don't lose value as a student (which I may anyway) but if my plan to transfer doesn't work, I lose everything. The scholarship is small, but it will be stupid of me to lose it. I haven't tried talking to anyone in admin or even for advice because I don't have a concrete plan and this would be a major exception. I'm so afraid of making a mistake at this point because I feel like I'll end up with even more catastrophic consequences, but I need to change something.

**Local Startups vs AI Takeover**  
Picture Mississippi's budding entrepreneurs waking up one morning to find their coffee brewed by AI, only to check their balances and realize their precious startup dream is now part of a large neural network. Dramatic? Maybe, but still, AI's rise invariably means new challenges and opportunities for these brave business champions. 

**Opportunity or Omen?**  
AI can offer powerful tools to streamline operations, analyze huge datasets, and develop next-gen products. But it also brings the threat of automation replacing human roles or even making some startups obsolete overnight. The challenge for Mississippi businesses is to harness AI's potential without becoming just another line of code.
