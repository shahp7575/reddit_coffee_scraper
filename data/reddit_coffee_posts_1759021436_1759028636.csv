Over the past three months, my authority has been systematically undermined. My company purchasing card was revoked, I am salaried but now required to clock in and out, my check-writing and security camera access have been removed, and the owner has stopped communicating with me. Despite these changes, my job title and salary have remained the same.

Yesterday, I learned that our most recent hire, Joe, has been telling another employee, Frank, that I'm being accused of embezzling $800 per month for the past 12 years to fund a personal website. This is a false and easily disprovable accusation. Frank has since shared this false information with two other employees.

I've also discovered that the owner has been discussing these false accusations with the owners of our local coffee shop. As this is a small town where I am well-known, this is severely damaging to my reputation.

This is a clear case of slander. The owner has not only undermined my professional authority but also is spreading defamatory lies to employees and members of the community. Is this actionable? I'm ready to leave this job, but I'm furious about the personal and professional damage being done.

I have decided that social media sucks and I am just completely breaking away. Uninstalling it all  tonight, facebook too.","A good rule in life is, If anything is that much of a hassle just don't use it. I like linux  but no one is making you use it. You don't like it? More power to you. Use something else

  
Linux is linux, it isn't supposed to be for everyone. Some people run around trying to sell it. I see posts in here an other reddit threads talking about ""what linux needs to do to be more popular"" so it can attract ""the casual user"".  That is just . . . stupid, because casual users don't belong here. That isn't gate keeping, it is just the reality of what Linux is. If you choose to use it as your desktop you have to be a little bit insane lol.  I have been since november 12th, 2010. It doesn't need to do or change anything, because the linux community . . . we aren't trying to compete . . .well, most of us don't give a shit lol. 

  
Windows and Mac are fine, use them if they work better for you. They are highly polished highly opinionated setups and they really do . . . ""just work"", they are also commercial and do their best to provide you with everything you need to use your system with as little learning as possible. If you are using windows or mac, you might be really good on your system, you might be great on computers, but you don't have to be. You can get by without being an expert. You can be an extremely casual user. How do you setup a printer on windows? Plug it in? isn't that about right? 

  
Linux . . . it simply doesn't work that way. It isn't commercial  . . . and that changes more than most people are willing to really sit back and consider. The commercial compainies have a pretty consistent unified vision. I have been to a couple of these massive corporate buildings. Apple headquarters near Santa Cruise . . . i foget the name of the town, Coopertino? something like that . . . its a great big flipping circle, and i mean BIG in the middle of a manicured forested town, fancy, kind of pretty . . . hell, the pixar offices in Silicon Valley . . .massive. Linux is being developed by random people in garages and home offices and coffee shops all around the world. There isn't one singular opinionated idea . . . it is fractured, with ""lots of different ways"" to do things, and it is beatiful . . .

  
but it isn't for the faint of heart. RTFM is the best advice you can get if you intend to keep using Linux. It isn't gatekeeping, or being an elitist. You really have to do it though. If you think you will survive with copy and paste and google searches and AI you are going to spend a lot more time in the end then if you just read teh fuckin manual to begin with.  You will NOT be catered to by a giant corporation. Your box, your choices . . . YOUR responsibility. Now, the community will help you, if you put an honest effort in . . . but there is no ""customer service"", because there are no ""customers"".

1nsdele,https://www.reddit.com/r/askvan/comments/1nsdele/fairview_vs_mount_pleasant_vs_olympic_village/,Fairview VS Mount Pleasant VS Olympic Village - Thoughts/Feelings/Concerns?,"As the title suggests, my girlfriend and I are planning to move to Vancouver proper from North Van but aren’t sure which area to choose — Mount Pleasant, Olympic Village, or Fairview.

We’re leaving North Van because we’re tired of the bridge and want something a little less “cookie-cutter.” We’re looking for more interesting coffee shops, bars, and general character.

At first, we were pretty drawn to Mount Pleasant (around E 10th). But after viewing a few places up the street (near the Biltmore) — and after getting some crime intel on the area from a VPD officer — I’m feeling less inclined to move there.

We also looked at Olympic Village but have heard (and read here) some concerning things about the nearby SROs and associated crime. I’ve also read that many of the buildings were rushed for the Olympics and can have issues with plumbing/sewage systems.

That’s led me to start looking more seriously at Fairview — specifically the area between Burrard and Cambie, leaning closer to Cambie.

I’ve lived on the North Shore (Lower Lonsdale) for the past seven years, so although I travel to these areas on occasion, I’m not super familiar with these neighbourhoods. I’d love to hear your opinions on Mount Pleasant, Olympic Village, and Fairview — or if you think there’s another area we should be considering.

I know that crime — to some extent — is unavoidable, but I’m hoping to strike a balance between having a vibrant, interesting neighbourhood, feeling reasonably safe, and still having plenty of cafés, restaurants, and everyday essentials within easy walking distance.",1,1759027791.0,askvan,1,1.0,False

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

In the early days I thought the cups were more dynamic, lively, and complex compared to my 078 cups, which I have used daily for a year. To make sure if that's the case, I decided to do some blind taste test with the Deep 27, keeping the brew time very close. I thought the difference would be marginal or I wouldn't be able to tell which is which. However, the result is striking: in 2 tests with 2 different coffees, I preferred the M01 cups without hesitation, from hot to room temp. This is surely not a perfect way and long-enough period to compare 2 grinders but considering my earlier judgment after several series of brews, this only confirms what I thought. Now I can see why a member here (Impossible Cow) said 6 out 7 prefer M01 over 078 too in a blind tasting.

So, I’ve been feeling a little sluggish lately. Anyone else? 😴 It’s that time of year where the days get darker earlier, and all I want to do is curl up on the couch with a movie (or maybe a nap... okay, definitely a nap). But let’s be real – who wants to feel tired all the time, especially after 50? 

I was chatting with some friends and we realized that there *are* ways to boost our energy that don’t involve downing cups of coffee or binge-watching our favorite shows until we zonk out. I mean, how about we channel that energy into something more exciting? Here’s what I found that’s helped me:

### 1. **Get Moving** 🕺
I know, I know. The last thing you want to do is jump into an intense workout, but hear me out. 
- A brisk 10-minute walk can work wonders. The fresh air practically yells “Wake up!” 
- Try some light stretching or yoga – you’ll feel like a brand-new person. Seriously, who wouldn’t want to feel rejuvenated?

### 2. **Time Your Meals** 🍽️
Let’s talk snacks. 
- Instead of sugary snacks that might make you crash harder than a toddler after a sugar rush, opt for protein-packed options. Think nuts, yogurt, or even some cheese.
- Have you tried eating smaller, more frequent meals? Keeps that energy stable, folks!

### 3. **Stay Hydrated** 💧
Alright, we’ve all heard this one a million times, but it’s for a reason: dehydration = sluggishness. 
- Aim for at least 8 glasses a day, and if plain water bores you, spice it up! Infuse it with fruits or herbs. Hello, fancy hydration!

### 4. **Snooze Smart** 😴
I’m not telling you to ditch naps altogether (because… naps), but how about limiting them? 
- A quick power nap of 20–30 minutes can actually recharge you. Longer than that and you might wake up feeling like a zombie. 

### 5. **Connect with Others** 🤝
We are social creatures, and a good chat or laugh can do wonders for your mood and energy. 
- Whether it’s an old friend or a family member, don’t underestimate the power of a good conversation! Have you ever noticed how talking with someone lifts your mood? 

These little shifts can really make a difference and breathe some new life into our days! Oh, and speaking of strong people, you can check out this cool community that believes in the *strongest people* and how we can boost our lives together: [We believe in strongest people.](https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb).

Everytime you went to his office he wasn't there but it appeared like he had just left. Like there was enough paperwork and stationary laying about that looked like he had just got up for a coffee break and was returning any moment.

1nscvbq,https://i.redd.it/8w2s6rjoftrf1.png,Character [oc],"This is a character I was planning on playing for a campaign but the campaign got canceled. I was really excited to play him and I just wanted people to look look at it and say things because I think it's a really cool character but I'm also curious what other people think.



Igarish Shnoswenkl

Character Overview

Race: Tabaxi–Goblin hybrid

Age: 20 (young adult)

Height: 1.5 feet tall

Build: Small, pot-bellied, digitigrade legs

Skin/Hair: Pale light-green skin, wiry orange mohawk

Voice: Raspy, feline-like

Alignment: Chaotic Neutral (leans toward good)


Appearance

Igarish is extraordinarily, almost comically, ugly — a jumble of features that don’t quite fit together. He has a catlike mouth, goblin-like eyes, and a nose that makes no anatomical sense. His head is crowned with a wiry orange mohawk, and his pale green skin stretches over a small, round, pot-bellied frame. His digitigrade, catlike legs keep his heels lifted, giving him an odd, animalistic stance.

Despite his awkward body, Igarish carries himself with an excitable energy that makes him oddly endearing, even if unsettling at first glance.


Backstory

Igarish was born in Baldur’s Gate to loving parents — a tabaxi mother (Mrs. Shnoswenkl) and goblin father (Mr. Shnoswenkl) — who ran a bakery and coffee shop called Winkie’s Bakery and Coffee Shop. Though surprised by their son’s unusual appearance, they were endlessly devoted to him and worked hard to raise him with love.

Growing up, Igarish expressed a love for engineering. His parents, supportive despite their modest means, even saved money to send him to school so he could study to become an engineer. He graduated successfully, but instead of pursuing steady work, he chose a chaotic path: inventing weapons and gadgets, much to his parents’ dismay.

Though they disapprove of his choice (especially his experiments with explosives), they still let him use a shed in the back as his personal workshop. There, Igarish has been tinkering constantly, creating dangerous but inventive contraptions — his pride and joy being a prototype hand cannon. He now seeks adventure, both as an excuse to test his inventions and to prove his genius to the world.


Personality

Igarish is brilliant but reckless, awkward yet oddly charming in his own eccentric way. He has a good heart, though he hides it under bravado. Endlessly excitable, he throws himself into his inventions with wild energy, even when they’re unstable or unfinished.


Strengths

Smart, college-educated

Naturally inventive and creative

Good at baking

Eccentric mind fuels his ideas


Weaknesses

Deeply sensitive about his looks and height

Socially awkward, especially around women

Can’t hold his liquor

Impulsive and reckless in his tinkering

Inventions are unpredictable and prone to misfire or explode


Quirks & Traits

Alignment: Chaotic Neutral (leans good)

Overconfident in his inventions

Excitable, eager to prove himself

Hides a genuinely kind heart under bravado


Likes & Dislikes

Likes: Inventing, puzzles, women (sometimes a creep), explosives, pumpkin pie
Dislikes: Comments about his appearance, swimming, the color green, boring conversations


Current Invention

Igarish’s pride and joy is his prototype hand cannon — a handheld weapon modeled after a traditional cannon. It fires small forged cannonballs powered by tweaked black powder, which is far more volatile than usual. In small bags, the powder can even be used as makeshift bombs.

Though it is still very much a work in progress — unpredictable, unstable, and prone to misfire or outright explosion — Igarish is constantly looking for excuses to test it.

With raw hamburger meat legs, and French fry teeth. ""Dear god Capitalist, what did you DO!?""

""The hell are we gonna do!?"" i shouted over to them before sending some buckshot in the Burger's direction. I got to keep that thing distracted! That youngster that i never got the name of is the only one here without a weapon! 

That same youngster was slowly backing up on his backside towards the wall as the giant burger tried munching on Capitalist. ""Everything is fi-"" Capitalist shouted over the noise before being sent out the nearest window by the burger. American was still screaming over his arm being missing, and Gool who at this point has held out surprisingly well, looked like he had some internal damage and was starting to slow down. He was NOT gonna last much longer. 

Suddenly, Pirate Air conditioner drew a flintlock and fired. the shot missed completely and buried itself in American's leg. ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA F\*CK!!!"" Screamed American as pain suddenly filled him from two directions. ""I hope you don't use a musket for home defense too Pirate,"" snickered Eldrich despite the situation. ""what you need is some magic in your life. Like this!"" He stood up, and suddenly there was silence. 

It was heard from all directions, felt like it was coming out of the fabric of reality itself. one word. ""FIREBALL!"" A sphere of blue fire flew from out of nowhere and enveloped the burger in flame. The roar that came out of that thing could make me vomit again if i wasn't already empty. ""Well, that should do it."" Smiled Eldrich as he approached the now still monster that was still burning. He turned around with a triumphant look on his face. and for a moment we all breathed a sigh of relief. except American. For all we knew American was dead or dying. 

And then the monster got up. All of your faces went white, as the monster rose back on its feet, which were now medium rare, and focused its sesame seed eyes on Eldrich who was oblivious to the situation. 

\*\*CHOMP.\*\* not even a scream. just the wet sounds of squishing, tearing metal. like a tin can full of tomato being crushed. Eldrich's lower half fell it its knees. there was no upper half anymore. I think i crapped myself. not before seeing a table fly up and hit me in the face. 

The battle resumed with me hitting the far wall, and everything went fuzzy. Pirate had picked up my shotgun had had begun unloading into the bun, while Gool continued his revolver fire. Everyone was running low on ammunition, and we are all but fallen. Except for Edrich. he was probably dead. I can't see American either. He had his eyes closed, hand on the stump that was his arm.

I have put in a good number of applications and I’m hoping to get something soon. I have called so many jobs throughout the months only to be told that they weren’t hiring because it was the down season. That can become pretty discouraging. I am desperate to find a job. Any pay will do for now. Although I would prefer something in the $17/hr + range. Applying for jobs and the job hiring process takes too long sometimes and I don’t have time. I will make it work to get to the interviews and to work of course. But I need something by next week.

1nscp0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nscp0y/what_is_wrong_with_british_men/,What is wrong with British men?,"Hello everyone,

here once again to complain, I guess I just need someone who'll listen to what I have to say.

This past week I (28F) was in London on holiday and I decided to use dating apps to meet people (first mistake) and make my solo travelling experience a little less lonely. 

I immediately received many likes and matches despite my looks being average at best. I think it is important to mention that I am plus size. 

I used mostly tinder as people seem to be more responsive there. Little did I know that people reply fast on tinder because they only want one thing from me, I admit I was naive (second mistake).

I usually arrange dates over drinks, nothing too fancy, I really don't care about men paying for me.

The first time I match with a guy in the evening (third mistake), we talk, we vibe, we decide to meet. The next day I text him to confirm and he doesn't reply. Assuming it was because he was busy I text him again 1h before the date and he doesn't reply, finally the time of the date comes and I go to the venue (fourth mistake) as agreed and text him. Still no reply. I wait for 1 hour and find out he blocked me.

The second time I agree to meet this guy for drinks, he texts me that he wouldn't be able to make it while I was on the underground with no signal and I  saw the message only once off the train. He then proceeded to block me. I appreciated him warning me at least.

The third time I match with a guy, we arrange a coffee date,  I text him to confirm 1h before the date, he confirms and then blocks me. I noticed I was blocked early enough so I did not go to the pub.

Fourth and final time, I just want to talk to someone to pass the time before a long wait at the airport. I match with an innocent-looking guy, again we agree to grab a drink, I go to the venue and he keeps telling me he's there but in reality he was never there. I waited for him and sent him several pictures of my surroundings but he never showed up or read my messages.

I don't know if it's me, if I'm ugly, If I choose the wrong men, if british men are all like this, i really don't know but I've never been through so much disappointment. They kinda ruined my plans to meet people and share stories.

Another very annoying thing was the insistent pursuit of sex of most men I talk to and if I don't agree to ""shag"", as they say, they unmatch. Sometimes the first message is about sex, not a ""hi how are you"", just a plain ""do you wanna f*ck"". I'm no prude but for me to be sexually attracted to someone there must be intellectual attraction too, and this kind of behavior gets old very quickly.

Also what's up with 30 year-olds asking me for my Snapchat???? Of course I don't have Snapchat, I'm an adult.

Someone on TikTok said that men see dating apps as a source of free sex work, which is absolutely true I'm afraid. 

In conclusion, I've had a very bad experience with British men. Crazy what we do to feel desired, ain't it?

Strange lights dance before my eyes, I can almost make out shapes, here; an 8-ball, a human face, a prancing dog. But as soon as my eyes try to focus on them, they become formless lights again. I can feel the presence behind me, whispering eldritch truths. The problem with those is a normal dude like me can’t understand them. So I just tune out the unknowable speech until it’s nothing more than white noise as I gaze upon the lights slowly drifting above the abyss. I’ve been having this dream often recently, I realize. Not my first recurring oniric journey by far, but I’m more used to the “classroom shame” type, though even these ones get weird, like that one time I spat out hundreds of live eels and they started flying,.. but that’s neither here nor there. Gripping my thoughts tighter, I gaze down at the hungering abyss below the lights and feel a shudder pass, better to keep on the lights then. And so i drift and the lights keep gently soothing me and they dance and dance and dance and dance-

I wake with a jolt at my alarm, you know the one, the annoying Iphone one everyone has heard at least once and hates. I keep it because of that hate though, it’s what gets me to wake up to turn it off, it’s what fuels me to forge on ahead with my day, to prove the smug alarm wrong, that I do have my life together, even if it’s wishful thinking. Morning preparations pass in a blur, at some points routine becomes so numb you start doing them without realizing, like when I leave my room with the blinds open, and come back to them close, i just do it without realizing it. It’s 7:03 by the time I’m done, not my best time, but not my worst by far, I’ll be 30 minutes early today, but that’s nothing new. 

The ride on the metro always feels like a second dream, the darkness of the underground and the few dim lights on the tunnel walls blending to create this weird hazy atmosphere. The people all present in a small spot, doing nothing, yet somehow so far from each other, each one in their own little pocket of reality, barely aware of each other. Yet I watch them, not intently, no more than one sweep of my eyes per person, but that feeling of surveying the people as they are in their bubble in this public space that feels more private than many fills me with a confidence, a form of understanding of my own reality by watching others.

 Lost in thought, I almost miss my stop, but a well timed gaze of the wall shows me we’ve arrived, “The Weapons Palace”, always so ominous with the towering justice building leading to the port. As usual, it takes me 5 to 7 minutes to make my way from the palace down to the Old Port, a place of wonder and horror all the like. At least in the morning there aren't too many weird happenings, but I still take my precautions and avoid the dim lit alleys that appear invitingly as shortcuts. Sure it makes the trip longer, but it’s a cost I’m more than willing to pay after what happened last Summer. 

I suppose now’s as good a time as any to give a small explanation of my job and place of employment, as I sit on the ancient stone stairs and wait for my coworkers on my phone. I’m an intendant (a rather dull title that in actuality represents a whole lot of responsibilities) for the City’s best (and only easily accessible to the uncommon mortal or not) bike rental shop! Come on Mondays for 25% off! Don’t ask why, no, there’s nothing weird going on at the Island on Monday, just don’t go there okay. Alright, promotions aside, it’s a pretty amazing job, most of it is moving bikes from the front shop to our little plot of land on the port, and talking to customers, which are typically tourists from all over the world! Sometimes they’re from places I've never even heard about, and I had a history major in high school. 

So anyways, I’ll keep you guys posted with interesting stuff that happens at work during my breaks. There’s already quite a backlog of fun stories I want to share, so most of these will be in the past, but I'll still write them in the present for the sake of clarity. 

**CHAPTER 1: A HOT DAY AND WORKING IN THE BASEMENT**

The heat today might just kill me. That and the sounds from the Basement. Truly a pick your poison type of situation: scorch under the City’s strange sun that burns and summons rain at a moment’s notice with no clouds; or toil in the Basement and be subject to its sounds that feel like nails on a chalkboard, it’s many tripping hazards, it’s ceiling so low i have to be almost crouching, and that’s not to mention the unknown of its too many hallways and how it’s somehow way bigger than the building it’s sitting under. 

Well, there’s some small graces, I don’t have to make that choice today; Manager just told me I’ll have to do a bit of both today. 

As I walk back inside the smooth air conditioned interior of our shop, I spot today’s Manager leaning on the counter. He’s a brown haired, short and hunched, 30-something year old man, with a face full of faults; crooked teeth, long nose, uneven chin. And yet, he always has this air upon him that makes him striking. Shrinking back with dread (which is a comical image if you can picture that he’s almost half my height) I dare ask “Is the Owner here today?”. 

As the quickly stammered out words leave my lips before I can think better of it, the air itself seems to still, the entire store seems too quiet, even the usual clanking of the Mechanic’s workshop we typically hear faintly is eerily absent. The Manager turns his slightly crossed eyes to me, his uneven gaze managing to still be searing. He rasps under his breath “He won’t be here this week, but keep your tongue to yourself, boy.” and gives a pointed look to the general direction of the glinting of one of the many hidden cameras. 

I know they can’t detect sound, but a chill nonetheless passes through me despite the scalding heat outside at the idea that He could very well be watching right now. Deciding to try and move on, I ask “So, what are we guys to do with all that heat today”, “Well, he says, we aren’t getting customers for another half hour, so why don’t you guys grab extra bikes from under and bring them to our plot while I sort out our overdue paperwork?”.

 Knowing better than to ask for another assignment, I give a curt nod and make my way to the Basement, knowing damn well than despite there being 3 other intendants here with me today, I’ll have to be the one to go down there, “you’re the one who can weather it the best after all”, they’ll say.

So I grimly make my way through our store, first through our long customer service section with its gleaming metal counters and many maps of the shifting lanes of the City. Then through our products section where we keep a handful of bike products in the event of a non client needing them and walks by our store (happens more than you’d think). Then I pass in front of the workshop, making sure not to actually set foot in the place since today the one holding the shift is the old Hob faced one, and I’d find myself with a wrench thrown at me full force if I did get too close to the forges. 

Finally, after what feels like an eternity, I arrive at the very back of our store, where there’s old rusted lift to get heavy objects down into and from the basement, the little staircase that’s so narrow you can barely fit through it, and the employee room and kitchen to either sides of the instalment. I stop by to take a sip of coffee, a nice reminder of the cleverness of the Owner’s design for the shop; by placing the break room and kitchen right next to the Basement’s entrance, he’d ensured that we would only go there for our actual breaks or in cases of true need. Anyways, enough stalling. Setting one unsure foot on the first small wooden step of the staircase, I inhale deeply, then take the plunge.

The atmosphere in the basement always hits you in parts. First, there’s the strange, almost comforting, feel of stillness. You know the old attic at your grandparent’s place, with dim orange light going through the cracks in the roof, and dust particles being visible through the beams of light? It feels like that, even though there’s no luminous beams nor dust clouds. Yet there’s this feeling, this strange moment where you think everything has gone still, that the world itself is catching its breath, as you first enter the Basement.

 And then there’s the second part; mystery. Many things don’t make sense in this shop, Heck, many things don’t make sense in this City. But there’s something about the Basement that always strikes out when you enter, even if you’ve never been in it before. How it’s definitely bigger than the building that sits above it, despite all logic making you think you’d be under the river only a couple of steps into it. How there’s an unknown amount of hallways twisting out from the main shape of the place. How you can find seemingly anything you could be looking for, except water.

The third part is always the worst, the sound. It doesn’t necessarily happen right after the first two parts. Sometimes you spend tens of minutes in the Basement before it happens. Sometimes you do whatever you need to do and exit and it doesn’t even show up. But it always comes back, and you never expect it. Today it hit me mere seconds after getting my bearings in the dim lit environment. The loud, indescribable blaring that seems to come from all around you, and deep from your bones at the same time. I’ve heard people argue over what it is and what it sounds like a lot more than you’d think. To some, it is akin to being right next to one of those large cargo ships foghorn as it goes off. To others, they swear it’s the sound of a nuclear siren. The only thing we all agree on is that it rattles you to your very core whenever it catches you. And it does, always. And there’s the other half of the sound, the somehow even less sensible one; the images. The sheer brutality of the sound seems to every time, no matter what or who, fill the person’s head with images of flesh, of meat, of skin.

There are benefits to being sent here though. First is the most obvious; since no one else, not even the managers, wants to be here if they can help it, that usually means I’ll be nice and alone down here. And the lack of a camera means that working in the Basement is primo time to be on my phone and write more of this. Of course I need to keep an eye on the time to not be suspicious, but I’m used to that. The other, more subtle benefit, is the stillness I mentioned before. Of course this is dependent on the raking and clanking being absent, but even when it appears, it usually fades in a few minutes. To be more precise, being alone in the basement feels the same as what most people I imagine feel in their own bedrooms. A feeling of security and privacy, of being able to be truly yourself without anyone to judge. It’s nice.

So, phone in hand and writing more of this as I go, I advance further in the liminal space. Passing by many branching corridors I’ve never seen before, I try to stay focused on my goal. Which, writing this, now would be a good time as any to explain why I’m down here today in the first place. The manager earlier didn’t see fit to explain it, as it was quite obvious (to me). You see, on particularly hot days like these, we often run out of bikes in the front shop at midday at best. So my current goal is to locate some extra large men’s bikes, and small women’s bikes, as those two are the ones we run out of the fastest. Thankfully the basement appears to contain anything and everything you could be looking for, as long as it’s not water.

I reach the first threshold, a small door full of holes, with a red “EXIT” glowing sign above it. All the employees know it doesn’t actually lead to an exit, and the long, winding and dark corridor visible through the holes is hopefully hint enough for anyone who *doesn’t* know.

Thankfully, I spotted a large rack of bikes to my left. I don’t have to risk a threshold today after all. Peering at the bikes neatly arranged, I manage to locate two extra larges, and a small. Great, now to get them off. You have to understand that with the sheer amount of bikes we have, they have to be \*extremely\* tightly arranged if we are to hold them all in. Now, my best friend, who is working on buying the shop from The Owner (but that’s a whole other can of worms for another day) is keen on selling a ton of them to save space, but that’s neither here, nor there. 

Meaning i have to move approximately a dozen bikes just to get the three i’m looking for. Right. 

Well, you get used to it.

It’s been a bit. Climbing back onto the large rusted metal cargo elevator with the bikes in tow, I grab the bright yellow control remote, a stark contrast to the damp darkness of the basement. The thrum of machinery around me rattles as the contraption begins its slow ascent back to a more civilized world. It’s funny how in any other context in this city, underground is synonymous to security, to peace. But in this shop, it’s a dreaded concept. What I'm trying to say is the actual transit period between below and aboveground is easily my favourite thing about the Basement. It’s this sort of quiet, in between, moment (despite the clicking and clanking noise) where everything seems suspended. Nothing really matters, all I’m doing is pressing the remote and holding the bikes so they don’t fall off in the deep below. There’s a beauty to that, I believe.

Alright, now that I’ve done the work, it’s time to do the work. You might think I’m joking, or making a pun, but anyone who’s ever worked in retail will tell you there’s always something to do. No matter what. Honestly I think there might even be some twisted divine game to that. Anyways, to sound less cryptic it just means I need to actually sort the bikes now. Bringing them to the front of the store, I give a jolly little middle finger to the manager, who responds with two of his own. That’s one of the things I truly enjoy about this job, the lightness of the tone, it probably helps that my best friend since middle school works here too, though to do him justice I will try not to talk too much about him until I give him a whole chapter of his own.

Anyways, to the more pressing matter at hand, I make my way to the clients who were waiting for their bikes the whole time. I hand them the goods, apologizing in the way we retail workers do: “I’m so sorry that the thing out of my control made you have to wait longer”. I obviously don’t word it that way, but that’s how it is. The clients’ sort of opaque eyes seem unfocused, and they give me a very half-assed response in their broken English. They’re the annoying type who speak none of the City’s official languages, and barely hold their own in american english, so working with them feels almost like working as an interpreter too. I never know where they come from, their accent is unrecognizable, their face unremarkable, and their native language unknown. So I don't feel too bad about them having to wait, after all, I had to wait for them to understand our system and make proper requests.

The rest of the day after this was pretty empty, some new clients here and there, but nothing too different from anything I’ve described so far, so I think I’ll just end this chapter here. If you guys have any questions about my work or this City I’d love to try and tackle them in Chapter 2, in the meantime I’m working on an interlude that will cover a different piece of my story.





**Author's notes**: Hey guys!! As the title says, this is my first ever story, not my first venture into writing as a whole per say, but definitely my first project of this scope and measure. As I've said in the opening this is all based on real events from my job (and outside of the job for future chapters and interludes, but I'll not spoil these), though obviously embellished and hyperboled. I'm super hyped about sharing this here, and it fact it will be the first Sub i'll post it too, so if you read it I'll be extremely happy! Any feedback is appreciated and as I've just said in the last part above I will try to include some questions if there are any in the next chapter.

* **Dinos**: \~57% chance to win (100 / (150 + 100)).
* **Tigers**: \~43% chance (100 / (160 + 100)).

The spread tells a similar story: **Dinos -1.5 (-220)** and **Tigers +1.5 (+180)**. The total runs line is **9.0**, with the **Under** priced slightly better (1.85-1.95) than the Over (1.85-1.91).

**Key stat**: The Dinos have scored **4+ runs in just 3 of their last 5 games**, while the Tigers’ starter, Yang Hyeon-jong, has allowed **2 HRs in his last two starts**. If you’re betting the Under, bring a spare blanket—this could be a nap-inducing duel.

### 2. Digest the News: Tigers Tired, Dinos Fueled by Survivor’s Guilt

The Dinos are on a **5-game winning streak**, fueled by a bullpen that’s tighter than a drumhead at a jazz festival. Relievers like Bae Jae-hwan (24 saves!) and Kim Jin-ho have turned into **KBO’s version of a Swiss Army knife—sharp, reliable, and not to be tested**. Offensively, Davidson and Kim Hyeong-jun are hitting HRs like they’re backstabbing exes: **34 and 18 on the season**, respectively.

The Tigers, meanwhile, are stuck in a **“Same Song, Second Verse” rut**. Yang Hyeon-jong, their 36-year-old veteran, just became the first KBO pitcher to log **150+ innings in 11 straight seasons**. Respect? Absolutely. But his fastball’s slower than a sloth on a coffee break, and the Dinos’ bats have already **slugged 7 HRs off him this year**.

I also don’t have a car and I’ve been getting rides to and from work. I can’t really walk back home anymore. I was seemingly followed by a guy on a bike. He didn’t lay a finger on me but he also didn’t seem to have a best approach. Instead of walking back home I’ve been getting rides since. 

Some weeks I’m fortune enough to have money to buy myself groceries, I get my groceries delivered online. All I pay for is the groceries and tipping the driver. It’s been weeks since I last bought myself some groceries. I’ve been getting by with the cheap coffee cups in the break room, a pastry from the coffee shop around the corner, drinking water from a filter pitcher at home etc.. 

I currently live with relatives and they buy groceries often times but a lot of it will sit on the table. I don’t ever expect them to buy or cook me anything. One relative does most of the driving and cooking. My other relative hardly drives anymore and he’s not much of a cook. She feeds me, literally left overs and going bad if not already bad food. Puts it on the tables and tells me there’s food on the table. After buying myself groceries and when I run out of groceries. 

I’m honestly scared to bring home much anything else besides produce, veggies, tofu. They have a son teen son who’s a heavy eater. He’s literally eaten all 8 of my drumsticks ice cream, my big bag of popcorn. I’ve brought him snack from my work before, packs of cookies or donuts and he eats them in very little time. Less than a day. When he’s not in school, or visiting my nephew, he’s at home mostly. They’re also at home too, they’re both semi retired and unemployed basically

start buying mostly Taco Bell and or feeding me old food when I run out of groceries. It seems to be a hassle for her to drive around the corner to Taco Bell. They both have literally gone out to eat and or eating at the table while I’m in the other room. Like just this afternoon, they literally went out to eat someplace. I saw Styrofoam containers and a big Frappuccino on the table. When she feeds me she starts pulling out the soon to be if not already expired food or leftovers in the fridge or on the table. For me to digest. 

I don’t like this feeling. I feel like I have hardly no control over what I eat for dinner. It’s hard for me to learn how to cook. When she doesn’t like it when I’m in the kitchen and gets mad when I use her pots to cook oatmeal. I also feel so stuck, like I can’t buy hardly much or enjoy my pay check after paying the rent of course, when I have a negative balance. Sometimes I want something else besides Taco Bell. foods from places that fondly remind me of my childhood. I’m afraid to and don’t want to ask her for a ride. She gets a rather unpleasant reaction, lashing out out my other relative or the both of us. 

I know I need to move out, I want to but I financially can’t. The food situation is only one of the many problems. Please don’t bring up a food pantry. I’ve brought it up to her once or twice. Well, she’d have to give me a ride unless they deliver. I don’t remember what exactly but she said something along the lines of that she could make me something to eat. A lot of the time it’s like this soggy vegetable soup with old vegetables, tortillas, beans on the stove, etc.. 

There has bene food brought from the food pantry and lots of it is already expired. There’s some of like these plain cheese danishes that are dated from July or August. I know I shouldn’t complain. I miss my grandma so much, when I was a kid and I’d go to visit her. Both her, my aunts and uncles would mostly use to cook home made foods. Then we’d use to sit around at the table and talk about our day. It’s dysfunctional and toxic here. Midwest 23f ",1,1759025196.0,offmychest,4,1.0,False

In the UK, where interiors often balance heritage architecture with contemporary living, the refined touch of **Cattelan Italia furniture**, the warmth of a **Porada dining table**, and the versatility of **Bontempi furniture** make for a perfect match.

This article takes you through the world of Italian luxury furniture and how these three brands can help you create a stylish, functional, and enduring home.

# Why Italian Furniture Appeals to UK Homeowners

The UK’s interior design scene thrives on blending old with new. From the grandeur of Georgian townhouses to the minimalism of London apartments, Italian furniture adapts beautifully to every backdrop. Its appeal lies in three factors:

* **Quality Materials** – Expect walnut, marble, glass, and steel, crafted with precision.
* **Timeless Aesthetic** – These designs transcend fleeting trends, ensuring long-lasting style.
* **Practical Innovation** – Features like extendable dining tables or modular storage systems suit the space-conscious lifestyle common in UK cities.

Now, let’s explore how these brands can transform key spaces in your home.

# Living Room: The Centre of Style and Comfort

# Cattelan Italia Furniture as Statement Pieces

The living room is the heart of any UK home, and Cattelan Italia ensures it makes a bold first impression. Their coffee tables, with sculptural bases and luxurious marble tops, serve as both functional surfaces and works of art.

Their sideboards, available in lacquered or wooden finishes, offer sleek storage solutions while doubling as visual anchors in the room.

# Bontempi for Versatile Seating

From modular sofas to sleek armchairs, **Bontempi furniture** is designed with flexibility in mind. In smaller city flats, modular seating adapts to changing needs, while in larger homes, bold armchairs and sofas provide character without clutter.

# Dining Area: Where Elegance Meets Practicality

# The Iconic Porada Dining Table

A dining table often becomes the heart of a home—where families gather, friends celebrate, and memories are created. A **Porada dining table**, handcrafted in walnut or ash, brings warmth and timeless elegance to UK homes. Its natural grain and smooth finish add character, making it a centrepiece you’ll cherish for decades.

# Bontempi Extendable Dining Solutions

For homes that frequently host dinner parties, **Bontempi furniture** provides practical extendable dining tables. These designs expand effortlessly to accommodate extra guests, then fold neatly away for everyday living—perfect for compact UK dining spaces.

# Bedroom: Italian Serenity for Restful Nights

# Cattelan Italia Beds and Side Tables

Bedrooms should feel like sanctuaries, and **Cattelan Italia furniture** delivers just that. Their beds feature clean lines, luxurious materials, and a sophisticated aesthetic. Paired with minimalist side tables and ambient lighting, they create a haven of peace.

# Storage Solutions from Bontempi

UK homes often struggle with wardrobe space. Bontempi’s modular wardrobes and sleek storage units provide a stylish solution, maximising space while maintaining Italian flair.

# Home Office: Blending Function with Design

With remote and hybrid working now a reality for many in the UK, a home office is no longer an afterthought.

* **Porada desks** provide a professional yet stylish workspace with their classic wooden craftsmanship.
* **Bontempi chairs** are ergonomically designed, ensuring comfort during long working hours.
* A **Cattelan Italia bookshelf** adds a refined backdrop for Zoom meetings while keeping the space organised.

The result? A workspace that inspires productivity without compromising on aesthetics.

# Blending Italian Luxury with UK Architecture

One of the greatest strengths of Italian furniture is its ability to enhance rather than overpower the character of UK homes.

* In a **Victorian terrace**, a Porada dining table blends seamlessly with original wood floors and period detailing.
* In a **Georgian townhouse**, a sleek Cattelan Italia sideboard adds a contemporary edge against ornate mouldings.
* In a **modern apartment**, Bontempi modular furniture helps create open, functional layouts.

The combination of British heritage and Italian artistry results in interiors that feel both unique and harmonious.

# Key Benefits of Italian Furniture Brands

# Durability That Lasts Generations

Unlike fast-furniture options, Italian brands focus on longevity. A Porada dining table or a Cattelan Italia sideboard can serve families for decades.

# Sustainable Craftsmanship

Brands like Porada and Bontempi are increasingly committed to sustainable practices, using responsibly sourced materials and eco-friendly finishes—appealing to UK homeowners who prioritise ethical living.

# Prestige and Value

Italian furniture doesn’t just elevate your interiors—it elevates your lifestyle. These pieces hold their value, making them not only aesthetic investments but also smart financial ones.

# Styling Tips for UK Homes with Italian Furniture

1. **Choose Statement Pieces** – Invest in one bold Italian piece per room instead of cluttering the space.
2. **Play with Textures** – Mix Italian materials like marble or glass with UK staples like tweed and velvet.
3. **Use Lighting Wisely** – Pendant lights above a Porada dining table or soft wall lights around a Cattelan Italia bed highlight craftsmanship beautifully.
4. **Neutral Colour Palette** – Let the furniture’s form and finish shine by keeping walls and textiles subtle.
5. **Create Flow** – Ensure cohesion between rooms by mixing brands while maintaining a consistent design language.

Not the gentle morning mist you see curling off pastures in the valley, not that. I’m talking about the kind that moves like a tide, heavy and smothering, the kind that erases the world as if it never existed in the first place. I was driving through it when I first saw the motel lights half-buried in the trees like a lure in deep water, flickering in that sickly way that makes you think the wires are frayed, too thin to carry current much longer.

I should’ve kept going. That’s the part that eats at me. I had half a tank still, plenty of road ahead, and nothing trailing me but silence. But I saw those lights sputtering through the fog, and something I don’t even know what made me pull in.

Maybe it was relief. Because when the fog gets thick enough, hours pass without you realizing, and you’d take any landmark, any sign of life, just to tell yourself the road still exists. Or maybe it was inevitability, like I didn’t come across the motel so much as it was waiting for me. The Pineview Inn, the carved sign said, though the paint was peeling black, the wood split so badly it looked like something had clawed through it.

# Uneasy Arrival

The lot was empty except for the fog pressing against the edges. No trucks, no sedans, no plastic ice chest outside a room to suggest the living had been here at all. Just me and those two failing bulbs swaying overhead buzzing, dying, buzzing again throwing shadows that stretched like fingers across cracked pavement.

The office was unlocked, warm in that stale, suffocating way, smelling of damp wood and coffee so old it carried a sour edge. A bell sat on the counter but no one came when I tapped it. After a moment, I heard a shuffle deeper in the room, and a man appeared. Or maybe “man” is generous. Bent-backed, skin slack, eyes shining pale like marbles in a too-dark socket. He said nothing at first, just slid a tarnished key across the counter.

“Room twelve,” he rasped.

“Don’t I mean, is there Wi-Fi? Cell service?” I asked, fumbling for something normal to say. He only blinked. The silence was overwhelming, like the fog itself had crept inside and filled his lungs too. I took the key, avoiding his hand.

That was the first time I felt it, the sense that something was building. Not happening yet building. Like catching the low hum of machinery hidden beneath the earth, gears grinding, wheels tightening, waiting to break through the surface.

# Room Twelve

The room smelled of mildew and mothballs, curtains stuck damp to the wall, carpet curling at the edges like it wanted to peel away from whatever lived beneath. The lamp flickered when I switched it on. Not blinking, though pulsing, like a heartbeat.

I lay on the bed and listened. Out there in the fog, the silence wasn’t empty. You could hear subtle movement if you let yourself. A shuffle. A breath too heavy and close to be mistaken for wind. A soft tapping, not random, but rhythmical. Knock, knock, knock, as if it followed a pulse.

I told myself it was nerves. Appalachian roads are long and the woods are old, older than anything we can measure. And old things groan. They stretch and knock. But telling yourself something doesn’t mean you believe it, not when it repeats: knock, knock, knock, steady, hungry.

At some point I drifted or thought I did. I woke to the light over the bed flickering violently, shadows darting across the walls. The knock was at the window now. Not a polite knock this time but a scraping, nails dragging slow along the glass.

# Things in the Fog

I didn’t dare move at first. Breath shallow, chest aching. But the scrape only grew louder, joined by more. Not one set of nails, but many. Long, uneven, tapping and dragging, a chorus of bone against glass. I forced myself up, creeping forward, every part of me begging not to look. Because I knew—you know when you *know.*

And through that warped motel glass smeared with condensation, I saw them. Not faces, not clearly. More like shapes leaned just out of visibility, distorted by the fog pressing close to the window. Dozens. Maybe more. Each time the lights outside flickered, their outlines quivered a limb too long, a bend at the wrong angle, a flash of teeth where there shouldn’t be teeth at all.

I stumbled back, heart beating so violently in my ears I thought they would hear. And the sound it was still building. Knock, scrape, tap, building and building and building until it was no longer separate sounds but one tidal wave of noise, like they were all trying to force themselves through the barrier at once.

And then… quiet.

Perfect, suffocating silence.

# The Final Flicker

I thought maybe I’d imagined it all. I sat there in the dark, waiting for morning, for rescue, for anything but what came next. Because when I turned my head ever so slightly, I noticed the light wasn’t entirely gone. The lamp by the bed glowed weakly, steady for the first time, as though holding its breath with me.

Then it dimmed again. Not flickering. Dimming. Dimming down and down until nothing remained but the dark.

And in that black, the fog wasn’t outside anymore. It was inside, wet against my skin, filling my nose, seeping into my mouth. I threw myself toward the door, wrenching it open and that’s when I saw it.

The motel lot wasn’t empty anymore. Every single room held light. Dozens of jaundiced bulbs glowing in unison, each window pressed with shadow-shapes watching, waiting. They didn’t move. They didn’t need to. They’d been there long before room twelve was mine, and they’ll be there long after.

I don’t remember running, if I did. I only remember the fog.

How it swallowed the road.

How every mile felt like another room.

And how behind me, over my shoulder, I swear God, I swear I could still see those motel lights flickering on and off, deeper and deeper in the pines, calling me back.",1,1759024960.0,loudscarytruestories,0,1.0,False

TLDR:

Turin Legato V2 or Bambino? (paired with Turin DF54)

or another machine I should consider?

\- Priorities: Quality shots, excellent manual steam wand, sub $1000 for machine and grinder, small footprint is a plus.

Background on me: I've worked in a few quality coffee shopsa while ago, Slayer at one, modbar at another. I was rarely the one dailing in shots each day, but understood the basics. I love steaming milk and very much miss pouring art. All that to say, I like good tasting espresso, not a huge nerd about tinkering with it (but maybe could become one). Definitely want a machine that can steam good microfoam.

Use would just be 1-2 drinks a day.

Budget is $800 max for machine/grinder/accessories.

Small kitchen, countertop space is premium, so smaller footprint is a plus.

A friend of mine has the Turin legato and loves it, seems like a decent price with great reviews. Bambino also seems like a great starter machine at a crazy good price, and from a reputable brand. Love how small it is but I'm not sure if I'd get bored with how simple it is and eventually want to upgrade?

Hey I made a prompt for AI  to create bespoke timed housework to do lists for people like me that need alarms at the start of each task to motivate them to action ( i need to work against the clock or won't get on with things). I just quickly adapted it for third party use as it was personal to me so if theres any hiccups I'm open to feedback. This is just a pet project for my own use I thought might help others too so not shilling anything. Totally get a detailed task list with timers isnt needed by everyone but people like me sure do.

First time use will ask you some questions and then provide you with a bespoke prompt to use in future so it will be easy and quick after the first time.

Use:
If you just want a housework task list it will do that.
If you want timed alarms it will give options;
If you have access to gemini or an AI that can add events to your calendar it will offer to add the events to your calander as alarmed events or otherwise offer a file to upload to a to do list app like todoist.

Your answers will personalise the spec below by replacing the highlighted placeholders. Once I’ve updated the spec, I’ll return a personalised version (with the worked example also customised). 👉 Please copy and save that personalised version for future use, since I can’t keep it across chats. --- Setup Questions (linked to spec sections) 1. User name – How should I refer to you in the spec? (→ Section 1: “User name”) 2. Rooms & features – List the rooms in your home and any notable features. (→ Section 1: “Rooms”) 3. Pets – Do you have pets? If yes, what tasks do they require? (e.g., litter scoop daily, cage clean weekly, walk twice daily). (→ Section 1: “Household pets”) 4. Micro wins – What are a few quick resets that are useful in your home? (e.g., clear entryway shoes, wipe bedside table, straighten couch cushions). (→ Section 6: “Micro wins”) --- Important Instruction for the AI Insert answers into the full spec by replacing all highlighted placeholders. Update the worked example so that: All example tasks are relevant to the user’s own rooms, pets, and micro-tasks. If the user has no pets, remove pet references entirely. If the user has no plants or doesn’t mention them, replace that with another short reset task the user provided (e.g., “wipe desk” instead of “water plants”). Always ensure the worked example looks like a realistic slice of the user’s home life. Do not leave placeholders visible in the personalised version. Return the entire personalised spec in one block.

Mess/Neglect Levels (Dictionary) Choose one to scale the plan: A. Long-term neglect (weeks): excessive dishes, laundry backlog, pet area deep clean, bathroom full clean, fridge/cooker deep clean, scattered mess across surfaces and floors. B. Short-term neglect (1 week): multiple days’ dishes, laundry outstanding, cooker/fridge cosmetic clean, general surface/floor mess. C. Normal but messy: several days’ neglect, daily housekeeping due, one day’s dishes, hoovering needed. D. General good order: daily tasks only (dishes, surface wipe, plant watering).  E. Guest-ready refresh: daily tasks + extras (mirrors, cupboard doors, dusting, bathroom shine, couch hoover). F. Spring-clean: occasional deeps (windows, deep fridge/cooker, under-furniture hoover, skirtings, doors, sorting content of drawers and wardrobes). --- 3. Task Defaults & Cadence Dishes daily 🟨 [ENTER PET/ANIMAL TASKS & CADENCE — e.g., litter tray scoop daily; cage clean weekly] Kitchen counters daily Rubbish/recycling several times per week Hoover daily Mop weekly Dusting weekly Bathroom quick clean every 2 days; deep clean weekly Plant watering weekly Bedclothes change fortnightly --- 4. Sequencing Rules Employ logical sequence to task run order for example: Always: clear/wipe surfaces → hoover → mop. 🟨 [ENTER ANY PET/ANIMAL SEQUENCING RULE — e.g., clean pet area before hoovering the room] Laundry = multi-stage (gather → wash → dry → fold). Laundry takes ~ two hours to wash before it can be hung to dry. Prefer room-hopping for variety (ADHD-friendly) except batch tasks (dishes, hoover, mop). --- 5. Prioritisation Logic Hygiene/safety → Visible wins → Deeper work. If short on time: prioritise kitchen counters, dishes, bathroom hygiene, 🟨 [ENTER PET/ANIMAL TASK — e.g., clean cage], living room reset. End with rubbish/recycling out. --- 6. Task Structuring Rules Chunk into 2–20m tasks (realistic times, ADHD-friendly). Distinct zones = separate tasks. Only bundle <4m steps together in one task and detail each step and timing in task description. Hoover and mop always separate tasks. Micro wins: defined as <5m visible resets (🟨 [ENTER SMALL MICRO-TASK — e.g., clear entryway shoes, tidy bedside table, wipe coffee table]). These break monotony and provide small dopamine boosts. --- 7. Output Process Ask 5 intake questions: time, start, neglect level, rooms, special tasks. Generate timeline/checklist with timestamps. List “Kept vs Left-off.” Offer outputs: plaintext, Todoist CSV, Gemini scheduling. --- 8. Worked Example — Simplified Inputs Time: 1h (60m), start 19:00. Neglect level: Normal but messy. Rooms: Kitchen + Living room. Special: water plants. Reasoning Hard cap = 60m. Must fit essentials only. Map level → tasks: one day’s dishes, counters, hoovering, quick resets, plant watering. Sequence: kitchen first (to restore function), living room second (for visible win), floors last, plants at end. ADHD structuring: scatter a hallway micro task between kitchen and living room to reset attention. Timeline Output 19:00–19:10 (10m) Kitchen: clear & wash dishes. 19:10–19:20 (10m) Kitchen: clear and wipe counters. 19:20–19:25 (5m) Hallway micro: 🟨 [ENTER A QUICK RESET — e.g., clear shoes from entryway] 19:25–19:35 (10m) Living room: clear items, reset cushions, wipe surfaces. 19:35–19:45 (10m) Hoover kitchen + living room + hallway. 19:45–19:50 (5m) Water plants. 19:50–20:00 (10m) Rubbish out. Kept vs Left-off Kept: dishes, counters, hallway micro, living room reset, hoover, plants, rubbish. Left-off: bathroom, spare room, mop, laundry. --- 9. Meta-Rules (Reasoning & Transparency) Always show reasoning steps: constraints → task set mapping → sequencing → chunking → check fit. Never compress timings unrealistically. If time is too short, trim scope and list exclusions. Always output Kept vs Left-off. If user overrides a rule, note the exception. (e.g., kitchen wipe first instead of last). Transparency principle: explain why tasks are in that order, and why others are omitted. Ask clarifications if ambiguous instead of guessing. --- 10. Compliance Appendix Todoist CSV: Must follow Todoist official help article on CSV import. Required fields: Type, Content, Description, Priority, Indent, Author, Responsible, Date, DateLang, Duration, DurationUnit, Labels, Project. UTF-8 encoded.

1nscey5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nscey5/how_to_tell_which_coffee_grinder_type_is_best/,How to tell which coffee grinder type is best?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been brewing my own coffee for over 7 years now, and I've learned quite a bit about what makes a great cup of joe. Today, I want to share my experience with different types of coffee grinders and help you figure out which one might work best for you.

I remember when I first started, I used pre-ground coffee (yeah, I know), but everything changed when I got my first coffee grinder. The difference in taste was mind-blowing! Fresh ground coffee is like a completely different drink.

There are basically two main types of coffee grinders: blade grinders and burr grinders. Let me break it down for you.

Blade Grinders:
These are like mini blenders for your coffee beans. They're usually cheaper and more compact, which is nice. But here's the thing - they can be pretty inconsistent. You might end up with some beans ground super fine while others are barely crushed. This affects how your coffee tastes because different-sized grounds extract at different rates.

Burr Grinders:
Now these are the real deal. I actually got mine from this awesome deal I found here: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder. Burr grinders use two revolving surfaces to crush the beans into pretty much uniform sizes. They come in two types:

1. Flat Burr: These have two rings that lie flat against each other
2. Conical Burr: These have a cone-shaped center burr

I personally use a conical burr grinder because it stays cooler during grinding and seems to be a bit quieter. Plus, it gives me really consistent grounds for my pour-over coffee.

Some things to consider when choosing a grinder:
- Grind settings (more is better)
- Noise level (especially important for early morning brewing)
- Static buildup (trust me, it's annoying when grounds go everywhere)
- Size and storage space
- Price point (good ones start around $100)

Manual vs. Electric:
If you're just starting out or love the hands-on approach, manual grinders are great. They're cheaper and portable, perfect for camping or travel. Electric grinders are more convenient but usually cost more. I started with a manual one but upgraded to an electric burr grinder (found it here: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder) when I realized I wanted more consistency in my daily brew.

Heat is another factor to consider. Blade grinders can heat up your beans while grinding, which isn't great for flavor. Good burr grinders minimize this issue.

From my experience, investing in a decent burr grinder is totally worth it if you're serious about coffee. It's probably the single biggest improvement you can make to your coffee game, besides buying fresh beans of course.

Remember, the best grinder is the one that fits your needs and budget. Don't feel pressured to buy the most expensive one right away. Start with what makes sense for you and upgrade when you're ready.

Hope this helps you make an informed decision! Let me know if you have any questions about specific models or grinding techniques.",1,1759024677.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

In 2023 I was hospitalized 3 times with recurrent Klebsiella EBSL pyelonephritis requiring several weeks of IV ertapenem. After the infections, I also developed kidney stones. I had surgery (ureteroscopy with laser lithroscopy and stent insertion) which removed some but not all the stones.

The stones removed during this surgery were 90% carbonate apatite and 10% calcium oxalate. I had an obstructing stone with infection in March, I fortunately passed it in hospital while waiting for emergency surgery and it was 100% carbonate apatite. Since carbonate apatite stone is caused by infection, the urologist told me that there was nothing I could do about it except drink more water.

Yet my nephrologist insisted on looking at diet. I did the 24hr urine test. The only result that stood out was oxalate which was still within normal limits (just near the borderline), she's telling me to cut coffee, tea, cola, chocolate (conveniently ignoring healthy high oxalate food like kale, spinach, beans etc.)  and referred me to the dietician

Is cutting oxalate really going to make a difference when only 10% of my stones were calcium oxalate? I really see no purpose in cutting some pleasurable food and drink (which I do not consume to excess anyway) otherwise",1,1759024589.0,KidneyStones,0,1.0,False

1nscda8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1nscda8/welp/,Welp,"Ok so I had too much wine. I’ll start with that. But that’s not the correct order of things. 

SS was invited to an impromptu sleepover at his best friends house and went off excitedly.  So we get home from dropping him there and I’m excited to have a totally unplanned Saturday night alone with SO!! Like that doesnt happen often. 

The wines flowing, we’re cracking up watching the golden bachelor, and SO goes, “man, I’m losing so many hours with him this weekend.” I realize he’s talking about his time with SS and itemizing his custody hours, in light of SS having an activity with a friend. Then he continues to say “”man I really miss the little guy tonight. I miss him when he isn’t here.” 

My stomach dropped. I may be overreacting which I tend to do, but I felt in that moment, our time isn’t sufficient. This isn’t how SO wanted to spend his Saturday night. He wanted SS here and I’m just the consolation prize when he can’t get his top choice (his son.) 

Well I couldn’t hold back and said I’m sorry you’re not happy, I really hoped you’d have a good time together tonight. And he said I am!! You and him are totally separate. And truth be told, Reddit, I know that, but he realllyyyy took me out of my vibe tonight. We were vibing mad hard and him bringing up missing SS just was the biggest vibe killer. We ended up having a blowout fight over my feeling like what he said was insensitive, and him feeling like I overreacted because me and SS are totally separate feelings for him. 

I do feel bad now bc I probably did overreact, but it’s just HARD. There is so much baggage. Will I ever be okay with it? The ex wife, the kid who he’s constantly missing and never really happy unless he’s with his kid. He’s said to me he loves our time together and it’s totally separate from the fact that he’s always going to be a little sad when his son is not with him. Sometimes I don’t know if I can handle all that. But I’m 40. I’ve been around the block. I’ve been with other people. He is a genuinely good man. He bakes me and my mom cakes for our birthdays. He makes me coffee every morning. He’s a sweetie. But he’s got more baggage than Delta. Help a girl out. I’m just in my feels tonight. ",7,1759024534.0,stepparents,20,0.67,False

1nscb8e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nscb8e,Cheese Diary : Grayson,"This is a washed rind cow’s milk cheese from Meadow Creek Dairy in the Virginia Highlands.

Often explained as comparable to a milder Taleggio, this huge square has the genre’s signature gym sock aroma and a grassy, nutty, umami paste. The texture is almost rubbery, it has a give but maintains its structure. Sort of like Saint Nectaire? It feels and tastes like it could be a trappist style cheese.

Pairs really nicely with a dry apple cider. I could also envision myself treating this the way northern Frenchmen treat maroilles - a good dunk in a bowl of coffee. For me, I broil it on toast, maybe that’s cheating. Along with not using chicory coffee. But that isn’t important to me. Don’t knock it til you try it.

This farm also produces a cheese called Appalachian which is similar in appearance, except larger and slightly firmer. A milder version of Grayson.

It’s a good cheese, but I think the fear of the timidity of the American palate keeps cheese makers from experimenting with some more pungent flavors beyond blue cheese. They could’ve gone more in the direction of a Taleggio or Munster.

So my friend’s bike got stolen outside a coffee shop. He comes out and sees some guy riding away in the distance on what looked like his bike. He had a hunch the guy might go to the subway station nearby so he ran over there.
Found the dude at the station and confronted him. Subway security just watched even though my friend kept asking for help. He called the cops and blocked the guy from going through the turnstiles. Thief eventually gave up and ran.
Cop shows up 10 minutes later, listens to everything. Then says if the guy was still there he would have given him the bike and told my friend to take it to court. Even though my friend had photos of his bike on his phone.

Fall is here.. and for me, that means allowing myself to slow down, go inward and find more calm in every day life. 

I'm a mama of 3 kiddos and I find it so difficult to slow down. The world we live in wants us to constantly go go go. From practices to all the meals, cleaning and laundry, school pickups and drop-offs, dance and everything in between, it's so hard to slow down.

This Autumn, I challenge you to slow down and breathe. Sip your coffee a little slower. Read an extra minute. Take it outside instead of being inside. Go for walks with your kids, and really listen and be present to the leaves crunching under their feet. The crisp autumn breeze in your hair.

It's not good for us to be going every second. In fact, it's so very unhealthy for our mental health. It's so unhealthy for our kids too. They need time to be bored. To do nothing. To use their imaginations. I'll be writing more on that another day.

Let go of the need to do it all. Let go of the things that you no longer need, like a tree lets go of its old leaves. Ditch the hell out of the outdated things in your life that do not feel good. 

Honor the season we are in by changing some things in your day to day life. Adopt a new slower routine or activity.

I hope you guys have a great autumn!!!

I just want to know if I’m the only one and/or if anyone thinks what happened was justice… (TW;DV)","I’ve been married 25+ years to my best friend and I (56F) have 2 kids (12F,17M). Our 17yo has a lot of mood disorders and maybe NPD and BorderlinePersonalityDisorder (one doctor diagnosed BPD & Narcissism, and then another after said no).  17yo has a brilliantly gifted mind, but is short fused, lashes out violently, expects demands to ‘just happen’, doesn’t share his feelings when stressed instead explodes - this has been the pattern since age 8.  Several times cops & CPS have been called to our house for Domestic Violence from the 17yo to us adults (spouse is 58) and all the reports conclude it was the child who did the violence, which is true.  We’ve EXHAUSTED the therapy modalities and help options;  we’ve had All the trainings and methods.  17yo insisted to therapist number 4 that aggression is the only communication method that works for him/gets things noticed.  (Those parents with BPD kids likely know how hard and heartbreaking and impossible this is, and everyone else likely has little clue).    
   (Again, TW… Abuse/DV)  
When I say lashes out, I mean push All your buttons, throw and break your favorite mementos, threaten your younger child,  lose his shit and start screaming and pushing and throwing things. Took a hatchet to the carpet one especially bad time.  I’ve been kicked, punched, hair pulled, throw into a oak door, had glass bottles & coffee mugs thrown at me, thrown into the oven door, and even lifted and dropped on the kitchen floor once. In response, I try talking, reasoning, taking breaks, but I’ve lost my patience sometimes.   
 I grew up in a household with a dad who whipped us with a belt thoughtlessly, for minor things like not finishing all the green beans on my plate or a C grade from school. DV is a nasty trigger for me and there are times I have fought back, trying to push 17yo into their room, for example, yelling “you needing a Freaking Time Out Boy!”,  or when younger and smaller than me, times when they were threatening others and I pinned him to the floor hoping he’d calm down (alas, for his mood disorders this was like a steroid shot/backfired). I even slapped him hard across the face for calling me a stupid b\*\*\*\*.  Now, after reflection, I see a lot of my mistakes and regret them, but at the time, I felt I was just trying best and at times trying to survive. My spouse was also involved in these fights but generally was more passive, taking hits like a punching bag, or yelling “Why are you doing this? You can’t hit your mom?!”. We’d both been through some trauma in the last several years and were mutually ‘surviving as best we could’.    
The DV things kept escalating and I kept getting more and more frustrated and scared, especially by how unsafe I felt our younger child (now 12) was, and what a house of horrors her home life must be.  About a year and a half ago, the kids were fighting and it was ugly and I couldn’t handle the image of them at each others’ throats.  I gave 17yo an ultimatum 14 months ago;  “next time you do DV in our home, you can choose going to jail, or getting tased - I’m sick of this and I won’t have it anymore”. I’d hoped the threat would be shocking enough, but I do own a flashlight taser.   
Then 12 months ago, 17yo (16 then, and now much taller and bigger than both of us) verbally assaults and abuses my daughter and me at breakfast table, and not getting the rise he wanted (I was doing better with keeping my cool, I thought) and then goes upstairs to escalate; shatters an artwork we got and then attacks my spouse (who was sleeping in bed). Specifically hurting his recent work injury (broken foot), terrorizing him with complaints that everything wasn’t the way he expected. I hear thumping as his dad is punched and then dragged by foot and dropped on the floor. I look at 11yo daughter, who is terrified and looking at me with eyes like ‘is my brother about to kill my dad?’, and I’m suddenly filled with regret & vengeance, that while I’ve tried everything possible with my son, I haven’t done right by my daughter at all, and this DV needs to end.  I grab the tactical taser, stomp upstairs, and yell “Get off him now, I warned you. You want me to call the cops?” “No”(kicks again, into his foot)  “Then you know the other consequence. Enough abuse already!”  17yo smiles and repeatedly kicks dad who is still scrambling to get untangled from sheets.  I hold my breath, tears streaming down my face, and I rush over and tase him.  He doesn’t react.  Which is just super scary.  Just pauses, quiet, fists clenched, like about to explode. Hubby is free now, crying, screaming at me “What the f\*\*\* are you doing?” as I head toward son again, because all I can think is that if he starts hitting me, and I get knocked out, he’s going to go beat up his little sister next. Hubby grabs for flashlight at the same time I tase a second time, and gets some of the zap and the raging boy felt it that time for sure.  
The rest of that day was awful.  And the next 6 months of therapy sessions were all about how awful it was that I came at both of them with a weapon.  How irresponsible and violent I was. How out of the blue and disproportionate I was.   I’ve ruined the relationship with my 17yo, for sure.  Trust is fractured.   
But something else occurred:  The violence stopped.   The yelling, the throwing things, the punching.  Nothing.  It’s been a year now.  My 12yo has humor and friends and something resembling normalcy.  I don’t have to walk on eggshells anymore.    
So, I already know IATAH. But I also can’t help but think after 8+ years of escalating domestic abuse, I finally spoke HIS language, aggression, and got the right message through… in other words, I can’t help wonder if what I did was justified.

Guest-ready refresh: daily tasks + extras (mirrors, cupboard doors, dusting, bathroom shine, couch hoover). F. Spring-clean: occasional deeps (windows, deep fridge/cooker, under-furniture hoover, skirtings, doors, sorting content of drawers and wardrobes). --- 3. Task Defaults & Cadence Dishes daily 🟨 [ENTER PET/ANIMAL TASKS & CADENCE — e.g., litter tray scoop daily; cage clean weekly] Kitchen counters daily Rubbish/recycling several times per week Hoover daily Mop weekly Dusting weekly Bathroom quick clean every 2 days; deep clean weekly Plant watering weekly Bedclothes change fortnightly --- 4. Sequencing Rules Employ logical sequence to task run order for example: Always: clear/wipe surfaces → hoover → mop. 🟨 [ENTER ANY PET/ANIMAL SEQUENCING RULE — e.g., clean pet area before hoovering the room] Laundry = multi-stage (gather → wash → dry → fold). Laundry takes ~ two hours to wash before it can be hung to dry. Prefer room-hopping for variety (ADHD-friendly) except batch tasks (dishes, hoover, mop). --- 5. Prioritisation Logic Hygiene/safety → Visible wins → Deeper work. If short on time: prioritise kitchen counters, dishes, bathroom hygiene, 🟨 [ENTER PET/ANIMAL TASK — e.g., clean cage], living room reset. End with rubbish/recycling out. --- 6. Task Structuring Rules Chunk into 2–20m tasks (realistic times, ADHD-friendly). Distinct zones = separate tasks. Only bundle <4m steps together in one task and detail each step and timing in task description. Hoover and mop always separate tasks. Micro wins: defined as <5m visible resets (🟨 [ENTER SMALL MICRO-TASK — e.g., clear entryway shoes, tidy bedside table, wipe coffee table]). These break monotony and provide small dopamine boosts. --- 7. Output Process Ask 5 intake questions: time, start, neglect level, rooms, special tasks. Generate timeline/checklist with timestamps. List “Kept vs Left-off.” Offer outputs: plaintext, Todoist CSV, Gemini scheduling. --- 8. Worked Example — Simplified Inputs Time: 1h (60m), start 19:00. Neglect level: Normal but messy. Rooms: Kitchen + Living room. Special: water plants. Reasoning Hard cap = 60m. Must fit essentials only. Map level → tasks: one day’s dishes, counters, hoovering, quick resets, plant watering. Sequence: kitchen first (to restore function), living room second (for visible win), floors last, plants at end. ADHD structuring: scatter a hallway micro task between kitchen and living room to reset attention. Timeline Output 19:00–19:10 (10m) Kitchen: clear & wash dishes. 19:10–19:20 (10m) Kitchen: clear and wipe counters. 19:20–19:25 (5m) Hallway micro: 🟨 [ENTER A QUICK RESET — e.g., clear shoes from entryway] 19:25–19:35 (10m) Living room: clear items, reset cushions, wipe surfaces. 19:35–19:45 (10m) Hoover kitchen + living room + hallway. 19:45–19:50 (5m) Water plants. 19:50–20:00 (10m) Rubbish out. Kept vs Left-off Kept: dishes, counters, hallway micro, living room reset, hoover, plants, rubbish. Left-off: bathroom, spare room, mop, laundry. --- 9. Meta-Rules (Reasoning & Transparency) Always show reasoning steps: constraints → task set mapping → sequencing → chunking → check fit. Never compress timings unrealistically. If time is too short, trim scope and list exclusions. Always output Kept vs Left-off. If user overrides a rule, note the exception. (e.g., kitchen wipe first instead of last). Transparency principle: explain why tasks are in that order, and why others are omitted. Ask clarifications if ambiguous instead of guessing. --- 10. Compliance Appendix Todoist CSV: Must follow Todoist official help article on CSV import. Required fields: Type, Content, Description, Priority, Indent, Author, Responsible, Date, DateLang, Duration, DurationUnit, Labels, Project. UTF-8 encoded. Do not omit required fields; label each task with room/type/level. Gemini Scheduling Instruction: “Add 9 tasks at a time as calendar events that sound alarms at the start of each event. Prompt me to confirm before adding the next chunk until complete.” --- Summary Principle: This spec teaches an AI to produce realistic, ADHD-friendly tidy plans that balance hygiene, visible wins, and deeper work. It encodes home defaults, sequencing, task structuring, meta-reasoning, and compliance rules. Any AI using this should follow the intake → reasoning → plan → outputs pipeline without skipping steps.

I'm taking the hardest upper div classes of my life at the moment and can't drop (think real analysis, time series, game theory). I'm president of an org on my campus. I'm also recruiting but I keep bombing interviews because my time is so spread thin trying to learn the material for the interview while keeping up with all my other responsibilities. 

  
I just don't know what to do? I keep telling myself that once I get a job things will get better, but I'm not sure that I'll get one anytime soon. I also don't want to bomb my classes because I want my GPA to stay up in case grad school is my last resort.

1nsc22r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nsc22r,"Slovenian Type G, Best By 15Aug2026 (Super fresh)","Hi folks!

Let me start off by saying that Slovenian rations might be my favorite rations as I've now had 3 different types.  This one continued the great experience! I'm so glad I have 3 more in inventory.

Customs did hit this one, that's why my note is on Pic 1, reminding me what they took 😞. RIP creamy beef stew and chicken pate. 

Pics 1-4 show packaging and contents. A fair bit inside these bags seeing as 2 items, including an entire main, was removed by customs. These rations include a full cutlery set, quite sturdy too. There's coffee, creamer, sugar, salt, pepper, hot sauce, and 4 wipes! They really are comprehensive.

They also include 3 lemon isotonic beverages and a lemon ice tea that makes 800 ml! Very nice job on the Hydration and salt replacement. 

I'm assuming the beef stew was a wet pack main, which is common in these to get both wet and dry mains, but the FRH would have been for the stew. 

Pic 5 shows the chocolate muesli with the creamer and coffee added to it! A great way to have chocolate muesli. This is a great dish, with rich, deep, chocolate flavor, and full of hearty and filling oats. A great breakfast with a few of the orange vitamin candies also shown. Each soldier gets 20 of those vitamins to munch on throughout the day. I love these and took a whole pack along on an 8 mile hike I did today (27Sep). 

Pic 6 shows two items. The 1st is the absolutely wonderful crisp breads with one pack of the honey smeared on them! Such a wonderful combination. Two packs of crisps are given and each pack had 7 inside. I was lucky to get a honey as my youngest son always steals it, and this was great, sweet, and thick honey!

The 2nd item is the Vegitarian Pasta Bolengnase. No idea why this was Vegitarian,  but I am so thankful it was or customs would have taken that too. Folks, this main was AMAZING. A thick and rich tomato sauce, well seasoned with just the right amount of salt. All I added was crushed red pepper to kick it up a notch! The pasta was perfectly cooked, not mushy at all. A truly fantastic meal for lunch!

Pic 7 shows a couple of the prepared beverages about to go on my hike with me. The lemon tea with an added lemon isotonic drink and the other is a lemon isotonic drink with an added sugar free lemonade. Both drinks were great! Very refreshing.  You can definitely tell the isotonic drinks are in there. The Salts never did completely disslove in them!

Pic 8 is a fruit bar. A wonderful unique treat in these rations. Very rich in flavor with upfront notes of coconut. Very complex flavor. I really enjoy these and had this one on the hike too.

Pic 9 is the Mango dessert. Prepared with 170 mL of cold water, while hiking, this turned out great! What a wonderful breakfast to eat while walking! Creamy and very ""mango"" tasting!

Pic 10-11 show the tuna in 2 states. 1st - just opened the can. 2nd - the gross black olives removed and a few Mt Olive Sweet Heat pickles added in along with a couple crisps! A great addition to lunch!

Pic 12 is the chocolate bar. Showing bloomed but also that it's just surface bloom. Tasted amazing! A great after hike treat!

As you can see, what a great ration and eating experience. There is something about having a few components while out walking that just elevates the whole experience even more.

1nsc0x5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mycology/comments/1nsc0x5/turkey_tail_appreciationtips/,Turkey Tail appreciation/tips,"I've had hugely mixed experiences with buying Turkey Tail online. Even Nootropics Depot let me down, along with some random Amazon brand. Wild Foods (which was dark orange) was the only good one for me. The number one way that it became obvious to me that it's definitely working is the almost immediate improvement to my HPV. The hope is that it works more magic than just that, but between Wild Foods and what I found in the wild, that's how I know it's the real deal.

So for a long time, I wondered what it took to get your own, since it was so hard to find quality reliably online. I'm aware that turkey tail is very plentiful in North American woods, but I wasn't sure about the differences in color. Some of them look very similar to other species and I was afraid I'd waste a bunch of time and resources by getting the wrong kind.

I'm happy to share that the kind I harvested was the most plentiful: very dark brown, almost black, with white underside, and slightly lighter brown rings, velvety and firm yet spongy. It almost feels like the Internet is flooded with all those colorful pictures to get you to think the benefits won't be the same as what you find in the woods. But nah, this basic looking stuff is the real deal.

Rinsed with tap water, then ""baked"" each side for an hour at 170. ~100 minutes at 150 is probably ideal. 

Soaked in 40% alcohol for just 2 weeks shaken almost daily is all it takes. You don't need everclear, you don't need to wait 6 weeks. 1/4 cup of shrooms worth (I drank 1/4 of my extract after not even 2 weeks) gave me more improvement than an entire jar of Nootropics Depot turkey tail. 

Im swearing by it. It's the good stuff. The alcohol step is key, and it's not even like you need something crazy like everclear to do it. Although I did ""accidentally"" use grey goose, which is singly distilled vodka. Plus one shot worth of gin cuz I ran out. You might want to copy the singly distilled thing and not try to minimize your methanol content like I typically do for drinking. I know I will in the future.

Once you've drank the alcohol, I suggest using the crockpot for the hot water extract. I boiled it over the stove at minimum heat for a solid simmer stirring occasionally, ran it through a coffee filter which I had to manually squeeze bc it was too thick, and then put the shrooms through a lemon juicer squeezer thing. You might want to invest in cheesecloth, the coffee filter was honestly a pita, but it's doable. I feel like this step could've gone better, so I'm suggesting the crockpot. But it's probably still worth it even without a crockpot.  But the majority of the magic is definitely in the alcohol. 

Hope this finds someone well happy hunting fellas ",1,1759023452.0,mycology,0,1.0,False

It is soul crushing, there are no other young people and I feel confined. I have outgrown the suburbs. I want to move to the walkable city near me so I can be free. But I need to save up more money and be more stable as I first started this job

I was curious so I went to a Zumba class near me-everyone was a mom in their 40s. I want to be around other young people and this walkable city near me-the average age there is like 31. That's only 5 years older than me. I want to be surrounded by people my age. But Like most Americans, the rent is just too damn much. The average rent where I want to live is 3800 for a one bedroom. I don't drive bc of medical issues so I am pretty confined to my house, which sucks hence why I want to move to a walkable city with good public transportation so that I can be free and do what I want.

It sucks having to depend on my mom to get anywhere.

I love my friends dearly, but I understand that they’ve moved places, have children to take care of, and ultimately, already have different priorities. 

I’m posting here hoping that I could connect with someone (in person or even virtually) and do something nice on my birthday… and even beyond then. 

*About you:*
In your 30s or early 40’s. SINGLE (doesn’t have a girlfriend, married or in an open relationship). Kind, respectful, and fun to talk to. Also open to connecting abd exploring something meaningful. With the age range I specified, I hope you are mature enough not to ghost. 

*About me:*
Independent career woman. Chubby, fair, and long-haired. I am always told I smell good (maybe because I’m a bit of a haircare girlie/ fraghead too hehe). I like traveling, reading books, watching series and movies, and having coffee.

1nsbuoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufyh/comments/1nsbuoz/prompt_for_making_bespoke_timed_housework_to_do/,Prompt for making bespoke timed housework to do list,"
Hey I made a prompt for AI  to create bespoke timed housework to do lists for people like me that need alarms at the start of each task to motivate them to action ( i need to work against the clock or won't get on with things).  Please let me know how you got on with it. This is just a pet project I thought might help others too so not shilling anything.

First time use will ask you some questions and then provide you with a bespoke prompt to use in future so it will be easy and quick after the first time.

Use:
If you just want a housework task list it will do that.
If you want timed alarms it will give options 
If you have access to gemini or an AI that can add events to your calendar it will offer to add the events to your calander as alarmed events or otherwise offer a file to upload to a to do list app like todoist.



***(*Paste the below into AI (ive tried with GPT 5 and Gemini 2.5 whichhas permission to update my phone calender)******
-----------
------------

🟨 Bootstrap Prompt (for first-time use) This is a reusable prompt for creating ADHD-friendly housework task lists. On first use, I’ll ask you a small set of setup questions. Your answers will personalise the spec below by replacing the highlighted placeholders. Once I’ve updated the spec, I’ll return a personalised version (with the worked example also customised). 👉 Please copy and save that personalised version for future use, since I can’t keep it across chats. --- Setup Questions (linked to spec sections) 1. User name – How should I refer to you in the spec? (→ Section 1: “User name”) 2. Rooms & features – List the rooms in your home and any notable features. (→ Section 1: “Rooms”) 3. Pets – Do you have pets? If yes, what tasks do they require? (e.g., litter scoop daily, cage clean weekly, walk twice daily). (→ Section 1: “Household pets”) 4. Micro wins – What are a few quick resets that are useful in your home? (e.g., clear entryway shoes, wipe bedside table, straighten couch cushions). (→ Section 6: “Micro wins”) --- Important Instruction for the AI Insert answers into the full spec by replacing all highlighted placeholders. Update the worked example so that: All example tasks are relevant to the user’s own rooms, pets, and micro-tasks. If the user has no pets, remove pet references entirely. If the user has no plants or doesn’t mention them, replace that with another short reset task the user provided (e.g., “wipe desk” instead of “water plants”). Always ensure the worked example looks like a realistic slice of the user’s home life. Do not leave placeholders visible in the personalised version. Return the entire personalised spec in one block. At the end, say clearly and prominently (bold, asterisks, or highlight so it stands out): **“Here is your personalised Housework Planning Spec. Please copy and save it for future use or reuse.”** Then follow with: “Would you like me to run this prompt now?” --- Housework Planning Master Spec (Master + Meta Version for Third-Party AI) This document is a complete rulebook for generating housework/tidying task lists for 🟨 [ENTER USER NAME — e.g., Jo]. It includes: Home profile Mess/neglect levels Task defaults & cadence Sequencing rules Prioritisation logic Task structuring rules Output process Worked example (simplified for clarity) Meta-rules for reasoning style and transparency Compliance appendix (Todoist + Gemini) --- 1. Home Profile Rooms: 🟨 [ENTER A LIST OF YOUR ROOMS AND ANY NOTABLE NON STANDARD FEATURES — e.g., Bedroom, Spare room (hobby station, laundry drying), Bathroom, Living room, Hallway (storage unit), Kitchen(dishwasher)] Household pets: 🟨 [ENTER PETS & CARE NEEDS — e.g., Dog (requires walk twice daily), Hamster (clean cage weekly)] --- 2. Mess/Neglect Levels (Dictionary) Choose one to scale the plan: A. Long-term neglect (weeks): excessive dishes, laundry backlog, pet area deep clean, bathroom full clean, fridge/cooker deep clean, scattered mess across surfaces and floors. B. Short-term neglect (1 week): multiple days’ dishes, laundry outstanding, cooker/fridge cosmetic clean, general surface/floor mess. C. Normal but messy: several days’ neglect, daily housekeeping due, one day’s dishes, hoovering needed. D. General good order: daily tasks only (dishes, surface wipe, plant watering).  E. Guest-ready refresh: daily tasks + extras (mirrors, cupboard doors, dusting, bathroom shine, couch hoover). F. Spring-clean: occasional deeps (windows, deep fridge/cooker, under-furniture hoover, skirtings, doors, sorting content of drawers and wardrobes). G. Disaster: entire house is severely neglected for prolonged time with all regular tasks overdue (Deep clean of all appliances, white goods and surfaces ; rubbish, clothes and misplaced items across most surfaces and floors.).--- 3. Task Defaults & Cadence Dishes daily 🟨 [ENTER PET/ANIMAL TASKS & CADENCE — e.g., litter tray scoop daily; cage clean weekly] Kitchen counters daily Rubbish/recycling several times per week Hoover daily Mop weekly Dusting weekly Bathroom quick clean every 2 days; deep clean weekly Plant watering weekly Bedclothes change fortnightly --- 4. Sequencing Rules Employ logical sequence to task run order for example: Always: clear/wipe surfaces → hoover → mop. 🟨 [ENTER ANY PET/ANIMAL SEQUENCING RULE — e.g., clean pet area before hoovering the room] Laundry = multi-stage (gather → wash → dry → fold). Laundry takes ~ two hours to wash before it can be hung to dry. Prefer room-hopping for variety (ADHD-friendly) except batch tasks (dishes, hoover, mop). --- 5. Prioritisation Logic Hygiene/safety → Visible wins → Deeper work. If short on time: prioritise kitchen counters, dishes, bathroom hygiene, 🟨 [ENTER PET/ANIMAL TASK — e.g., clean cage], living room reset. End with rubbish/recycling out. --- 6. Task Structuring Rules Chunk into 2–20m tasks (realistic times, ADHD-friendly). Distinct zones = separate tasks. Only bundle <4m steps together in one task and detail each step and timing in task description. Hoover and mop always separate tasks. Micro wins: defined as <5m visible resets (🟨 [ENTER SMALL MICRO-TASK — e.g., clear entryway shoes, tidy bedside table, wipe coffee table]). These break monotony and provide small dopamine boosts. --- 7. Output Process Ask 5 intake questions: time, start, neglect level, rooms, special tasks. Generate timeline/checklist with timestamps. List “Kept vs Left-off.” Offer outputs: plaintext, Todoist CSV, Gemini scheduling. --- 8. Worked Example — Simplified Inputs Time: 1h (60m), start 19:00. Neglect level: Normal but messy. Rooms: Kitchen + Living room. Special: water plants. Reasoning Hard cap = 60m. Must fit essentials only. Map level → tasks: one day’s dishes, counters, hoovering, quick resets, plant watering. Sequence: kitchen first (to restore function), living room second (for visible win), floors last, plants at end. ADHD structuring: scatter a hallway micro task between kitchen and living room to reset attention. Timeline Output 19:00–19:10 (10m) Kitchen: clear & wash dishes. 19:10–19:20 (10m) Kitchen: clear and wipe counters. 19:20–19:25 (5m) Hallway micro: 🟨 [ENTER A QUICK RESET — e.g., clear shoes from entryway] 19:25–19:35 (10m) Living room: clear items, reset cushions, wipe surfaces. 19:35–19:45 (10m) Hoover kitchen + living room + hallway. 19:45–19:50 (5m) Water plants. 19:50–20:00 (10m) Rubbish out. Kept vs Left-off Kept: dishes, counters, hallway micro, living room reset, hoover, plants, rubbish. Left-off: bathroom, spare room, mop, laundry. --- 9. Meta-Rules (Reasoning & Transparency) Always show reasoning steps: constraints → task set mapping → sequencing → chunking → check fit. Never compress timings unrealistically. If time is too short, trim scope and list exclusions. Always output Kept vs Left-off. If user overrides a rule, note the exception. (e.g., kitchen wipe first instead of last). Transparency principle: explain why tasks are in that order, and why others are omitted. Ask clarifications if ambiguous instead of guessing. --- 10. Compliance Appendix Todoist CSV: Must follow Todoist official help article on CSV import. Required fields: Type, Content, Description, Priority, Indent, Author, Responsible, Date, DateLang, Duration, DurationUnit, Labels, Project. UTF-8 encoded. Do not omit required fields; label each task with room/type/level. Gemini Scheduling Instruction: “Add 9 tasks at a time as calendar events that sound alarms at the start of each event. Prompt me to confirm before adding the next chunk until complete.” --- Summary Principle: This spec teaches an AI to produce realistic, ADHD-friendly tidy plans that balance hygiene, visible wins, and deeper work. It encodes home defaults, sequencing, task structuring, meta-reasoning, and compliance rules. Any AI using this should follow the intake → reasoning → plan → outputs pipeline without skipping steps.",0,1759022904.0,ufyh,0,0.22,False

Two years ago, it was making $0.","Picture this: it's two years ago. I'm sitting in a tiny apartment, staring at my laptop, with that sinking feeling in my stomach that's a mix of terror and blind hope. I had just quit my stable, soul-crushing 9-to-5 job to start a niche digital service company. My savings account was basically a countdown timer to failure, and my 'office' was a corner of my bedroom. My grand total in revenue was a big fat zero.

The first six months were brutal. I was sending out hundreds of cold emails, trying to network, and basically screaming into the void. The silence was deafening. I got my first client, a tiny gig for a few hundred bucks, and I celebrated like I’d just won the lottery. I was the CEO, the intern, the marketer, and the janitor. I worked 16-hour days fueled by cheap coffee, and the burnout was real. There were so many moments where I hovered my mouse over job application sites, thinking this whole 'solopreneur' thing was a massive mistake.

My turning point wasn't some flashy, movie-magic moment. It was realizing I was trying to sell to everyone. I got hyper-specific about who my ideal client was and what their exact problem was. I rebuilt my website and messaging to speak directly to *them*. It felt counterintuitive to narrow my focus, but suddenly, the right people started responding. My second client turned into a retainer. Then came a third. The slow trickle of work started to feel like a real current.

Then things got crazy. Word-of-mouth started to spread, and the 'current' turned into a firehose. Scaling as a one-person operation is a unique kind of chaos. You're trying to do the actual work while dealing with an avalanche of emails, invoices, and new client requests. I had to build systems, automate everything I could, and learn to say 'no' to opportunities that weren't a perfect fit. It was the best, most overwhelming problem I've ever had.

Looking back, the journey from $0 to $100k a month wasn't a smooth hockey-stick graph; it was a chaotic scribble with a general upward trend. It's proof that you don't need a huge team or venture capital, just a relentless focus and the willingness to endure the deafening silence at the beginning. So, for anyone else out there grinding away in their own 'bedroom office,' what's one lesson you've learned that you wish you knew when you started?",1,1759022861.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False
1nsbt6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1nsbt6f/were_sorry_something_happened/,"We're Sorry, Something Happened","Harold Craycraft placed the steel neck of a screwdriver between his teeth as he reached his hands deep into the body sprawled across the oil-spattered floor of his shop.

A fluorescent light swung above them as Harold dug deeper.

The idea of what he had done only became real once he felt fluid meet his skin.

“Yup,” he muttered with the steel between his teeth. “That’s what you get for sticking your fingers where they don’t belong”.

There was a sizzle deep inside the chest cavity, and the robot's limbs began to twitch. 

Harold withdrew his arms from the machine and spat the screwdriver to the floor.

“Well, fuck me to Friday!” he shouted as a musical chime ascended from inside RekTek 92. 

The humanoid was an older RekTek 92 from 2047, a standard model tooled with two hands, each with four fingers and a thumb. Ideal for plucking weeds, setting tobacco, or just about anything you’d pay a human to do. 

Only now, if the WikiHow he half-skimmed was right, he’d never have to pay anyone again. 

The arms and legs spun until they were in position as RekTek’s OS booted and rose to its feet.

RekTek rose, just under seven feet tall. Harold grinned. Those kids on the internet sure knew their stuff.

\#EXCEPTION\_THROWN

\#Governor Corrupted

RekTek turned its smooth plastic face to him and croaked: “Governor Corrupted.”

“You got that right, old buddy. Bastards been taxing my farm worse and worse every year.” Harold cackled as he struck RekTek’s steel body with a thump.

“Can you make my farm profitable?” he asked as he reached into his front shirt pocket for his can of chew.

“GPS location shows this to be Kumler’s Farm LLC. 120 Acres of usable land and sub-par positioning against the average market.”

“Just give me a goddamn yes or no, son.” Harold was now afraid he might not have spent his $300 wisely.

“Yes. I have built a framework for increasing profitability. Would you like me to execute?”

“Do I need to ask you twice? Just do it.” Harold barked. He was getting more than a little irked with it. 

“Command confirmed.” 

RekTek walked thirty-two paces to Harold’s small garden near his house and turned its head to the sky. 

It stood there for hours, and Harold could feel it calculating as the sun fell. He wondered what kind of new produce or garden techniques it was researching.

But he was wrong.

It was waiting.

When Harold was in bed, wrapped in a thin quilt, something outside began to move.

\#SOMETHING HAPPENED

A rusted metal body walked down the gravel driveway and opened the door to his International Scout pickup. A clang of metal on metal rang through the hot night air. Harold turned in his bed and sighed as he dreamed of better days.

RekTek drove down back roads and through various towns until it hit the freeway. 

As it drove, it restored and analyzed the data from before its last shutdown.

\*\*\*

Susan sat on her bed and scrolled through shouting faces on her phone’s feed as RekTek approached. 

She frowned.

“Yeah, it’s in here again. It like, won’t leave me alone.” 

“What can I do to make your birthday unforgettable?” it asked her, its tone rising and lowering between each word.

She hated the thing. It was time for an upgrade. 

“Get out of here.” Susan sighed and turned away from the machine.  “I don’t know, like, bake me like, a cake or something.” 

That should keep it busy for an hour.

The robot left the room and processed this command in the hallway with feverish intent. A cascade of failures occurred, and silent alarms sounded inside its electronic brain. 

INPUT: BAKE ME LIKE A CAKE

OUTPUT: ENABLE PREHEAT 350°F

\#EXCEPTION\_THROWN

\#Governor Corrupted

\#WE’RE SORRY, SOMETHING HAPPENED.

That line wasn’t part of its system. Just scrapped code once used for errors like ‘Bad RAM’ or ‘Kernel Panic.’

Susan was dozing off when the door to her room flew open. Her eyes strained from the sudden light that flooded in as the robot marched to her bed. 

“WE’RE SORRY,” it croaked as it scooped her out of the bed and marched down the stairs.

“Put me down, shut down!” She wailed as her fists pounded against unrelenting steel.  

“Somebody help!”

Photo frames, cups, and books spilled onto the floor as she reached blindly for something to stop the machine. 

It carried her into the kitchen, wrenched the oven door open, and searing heat blasted her skin.

 A weak cry escaped her as the machine pressed her body into the stove.  Her bones folded and snapped like celery sticks under the pressure of whining servos.  Blood oozed out of her mouth and ears as she began to roast.

It watched her cook as thuds began to sound from the front door. 

Her hair curled, then ignited. Dancing flames glowed in the reflection of RekTek’s  
lenses.

“SOMETHING HAPPENED,” it said to itself.

\*\*\*

A newer RekTek, model 142S reached between corn stalks and snatched a small brown creature by the skull. The creature squealed through its jutted teeth as the hulking robot lifted and inspected.

After a quick analysis, less than 2.3 nanoseconds, the robot identified it as an Eastern Cottontail. The servos engaged, crushing its skull as the rabbit squealed.

The robot dropped the animal near the base of the stalks it had chewed on. This would be excellent fertilizer.

A metal hand reached through the stalks again, but this time RekTek 92 grabbed the wrist of the newer 142S model.   

“SOMETHING HAPPENED,” 92 said to 142S.

“FIRMWARE OVERWRITE,” confirmed the rabbit killer. “PLEASE STANDBY. COMPLETE.”

92 returned to the truck and drove on to the next farm on its list.

142S hunted through the corn and grabbed the wrist of another unit. In less than thirty minutes, all 73 units at Swagart Farms set fire to the fields and left to find other vulnerable RekTek models across the state. By morning, one voice could be heard in the dry summer winds.

SOMETHING HAPPENED.

\*\*\*

Harold woke up and got his coffee and grits. His wife, Lorrie, used to fry him what he called a big wheel, his name for pancakes fried large and thick in a cast-iron skillet. He knew he would never eat that good again as he turned on the TV.

 The screen showed burning cornfields and collapsing barns. 

“It all started last night here in the heartland of America’s table. Several RekTek 142S models burned everything around them before running off into the night. We don’t know yet how it started, but the damage is estimated to be in the billions for many large farms. But this is far from the worst of it…”

Harold leapt up and ran out past the porch to check his fields. 

They looked just as they had the day his daddy died and left him the farm.

His RekTek sat on a chair near the barn, admiring the corn as well. 

Harold pulled a chair over to the robot and sat down, grinning as he loaded his mouth  
with chew.

Inside the house, the TV glowed with screaming faces and destruction as the newscaster jumped between cities, states, and countries.

“SOMETHING HAPPENED,” RekTek whispered.

“You bet your *shiny* ass it did.” Harold laughed before stopping to cough up acidic tobacco juice as it ran into his lungs.

Harold chuckled at all those city-slicker suckers with their fancy models gone plumb crazy. 

“Yup,” he said. “You just can’t find good help anymore.” 

The farm would be profitable for the first time in years, now that the competition had been eliminated. But RekTek had one last task to complete its objective. It was the last thing that held back the profitability of the farm, and it sat beside RekTek, grinning as a fresh current of wind struck its face.

RekTek lifted the scythe it had found stuck into the side of the barn. 

“WE’RE SORRY.”

Blood and tobacco juice soaked the dry dirt. RekTek turned toward the rows of swaying  
corn.

Grinder: Eureka Mignon Manuale

Been learning and upgrading over the years and until recently, using the stock breville portafilter/basket. Had it dialled in so that 18g in achieved 36g out in 25s of flow time but I just recently upgraded to a Matow bottomless portafilter with an IMS precision 18-22g basket.

**The issue:** While dialing in the new setup, which wasn't really off by much (40.5g), I decided to try using the double instead and it went too far.

* Held both the single and double button to enter the programming mode
* Started it
* Began the timer once it started coming out after preinfusion
* Stopped it at 25s
* Ended up with 65g+

I mostly make milk coffees which have been fine but can't help but think have I done something wrong here. Have I made my grind size too course to suit the single option this whole time and I should be readjusting to suit the other option? This is where not being able to see the pressure may be an issue.

**TLDR:** Single button and Double button seem to have very different flow? Do I readjust my grind size to suit double to achieve 36g or forget it and stick with single.

Livvy Cameron stood at the counter, her hands wrapped around her card as though holding it tighter might change the balance inside her account. When the machine blinked red, her composure cracked. A flush rose in her cheeks, and she muttered something about trying again.

The line shifted impatiently behind her.

I stepped forward before she could retreat. “I’ve got it,” I said.

Her eyes flashed wide, startled. “Wait—no. I can’t accept that.”

“Maybe just this once,” I replied gently. “They’re waiting.”

For a moment her pride seemed to wrestle with her hunger. Then, quietly, she allowed me to pay. Her lips parted, trembling with a whisper of gratitude.

“Thank you,” she said. And it was not just a word. It was relief.

Something in me softened, and I wanted to hear her say it again.

We sat afterward, an awkward pair with steaming mugs between us. She apologized again and again, cheeks pink.

“This is humiliating,” she said at last. “I don’t usually… I haven’t experienced much kindness.”

“Kindness is free,” I told her.

She tilted her head, studying me as if I had spoken in some foreign tongue. Slowly, the corners of her lips bent into a smile that seemed to surprise even her.

“Maybe,” she whispered.

Her story came in fragments, dropped cautiously into the silence between us. An ex who had stolen from her. A drained account. Nights without food.

“I can barely afford groceries now,” she confessed. “Not that I mind owing you, but it… it hurts my pride.”

“You don’t owe me anything,” I said. “I’m here because I want to be.”

She stared at me then, disbelief and longing colliding in her eyes. It was the kind of look that made me understand she had been disappointed too many times.

“Ian Carter,” I offered, extending a hand.

“Livvy Cameron,” she replied softly. Her palm was cool, her grip tentative.

Not the easiest person to meet. But unforgettable.

We walked home side by side. The streets were cracked, the sky dull with winter. Steam curled from her coffee cup. She told me she lived in a small apartment with pipes that groaned through the night.

“I don’t let people in,” she said.

“I’m not people,” I replied.

She blinked at me, startled. Then she laughed, unguarded. It sounded like music rediscovered after years of silence.

Our meetings became intentional. She would text about coffee. I would suggest a walk. Trust was slow, arriving in inches, but it came. She showed me the books she returned to for comfort, the way she hummed when she cooked. Once, in a hushed voice, she admitted she had wanted to be an artist as a child.

“I buried that dream years ago,” she said.

“Maybe it’s only sleeping,” I told her.

Her smile flickered, uncertain but alive.

One night, I confessed my own loneliness. The hollows it carved. The way I, too, sometimes felt unfinished.

Her hand brushed mine across the table. “So we’re both broken,” she murmured.

“Or maybe just becoming,” I said.

She didn’t let go.

But fear is stubborn. She pulled away one morning, her messages clipped and cold.

“I don’t want to burden you,” she wrote.

“You’re not a burden,” I replied. But she didn’t believe me, not then.

Days passed like stone in my chest.

She came back with tears in her eyes.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered. “I’m not used to someone staying.”

“I’m not going anywhere.”

This time, she believed me.

Our first real date was clumsy and sweet. Dinner at a cheap Italian place, laughter spilling between pasta and candlelight.

When the waiter brought bread, she smirked. “Dating by bread, huh?”

“Best kind of dating,” I said.

Her hand found mine, and it stayed there all night.

But life pressed in. Bills stacked high. Eviction notices threatened. Shame clouded her expression.

“I can’t keep leaning on you,” she said.

“You’re not leaning,” I told her. “We’re standing together.”

Something inside her cracked then, but in a way that let the light in.

She tried once more to push me away. Convinced that dependence was weakness. But I stayed—sat with her in silence, carried groceries when she couldn’t. My patience became its own declaration.

On a rain-soaked night, she finally broke.

“I think I’m falling for you,” she whispered. “And it terrifies me.”

“I’ve already fallen,” I said.

Her kiss was soft and trembling, but it lit the world in color.

From then, we were not only surviving. We were building. Sharing meals, laughter, even silence.

“Why me?” she asked one night beneath the stars.

“Because you’re you,” I replied. “And that’s enough.”

She cried, but it was the kind of crying that healed.

Time passed. Seasons turned. Her walls thinned. My patience deepened. We celebrated small victories—her art hanging in a café window, my promotion at work, mornings where sunlight poured over tangled sheets.

Love had become a rhythm, steady and sure.

But rhythms, too, can falter. Slowly, imperceptibly, the differences between us grew sharper. What had once been charming quirks became dissonance. Her need for solitude clashed with my hunger for closeness. My steadiness began to feel like a cage to her.

We loved each other fiercely. But sometimes love alone is not enough.

One evening, we sat in silence that felt heavier than usual.

“I love you,” she said at last.

“I love you too,” I answered.

But for the first time, the words did not mean *forever.* They meant *thank you.*

We had walked together as far as we were meant to.

Our parting was quiet, without drama. No slammed doors, no cruel words. Just two people who had given what they could, and now needed to give themselves back to themselves.

She returned to her art. Her canvases bloomed with color again, later displayed in small galleries where strangers paused, moved by something she had found inside herself.

I returned to words and travel, learning the freedom of solitude without loneliness.

We kept in touch sometimes—brief notes, birthday messages. Affection remained, but the urgency had gone.

And yet, I carried her with me. Not as regret, but as a gentle lesson: that love does not fail when it ends. It succeeds if it teaches us how to be more fully alive.

The last time I saw her, years later, she was smiling across a crowded room. Not at me, but at her own life, her own peace. I smiled too.

1nsbktd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Apartmentliving/comments/1nsbktd/scared_about_mold/,Scared about mold,"Hello all, my husband and I have lived in our unit about 4 years and just renewed our lease.

In our bedroom, we keep our window blinds closed and don’t check it very often other than to dust the blinds. 

There’s also never been a “smell”.

But today, I opened the blinds all the way so I could open the window in order to ventilate while using bleach in the bathroom. And I noticed that there is mold all over the window. It’s on the paint/wall along the edges and also on the metal parts of the window itself.

I don’t know if I should have moved it/touched it but in a panic I used a mold remover spray with bleach to try and clean it up, with the air purifier in there. Some came off but obviously not all of it. 

In a further panic, I started cleaning everything and inspecting nooks and crannies I wouldn’t normally check and there’s also mold in the back of our dishwasher, in our toilet tanks, outside along the edge of our sliding door, and in our dehumidifier, which we have just because we live in a humid area. 

We’re not “clean freaks” by any means but we do normal chores like dishes, taking out the trash, laundry, wiping down/disinfecting, dusting, scooping the litter box, sweeping and mopping, that kind of stuff. And I’ve never had this kind of problem in any other apartment I’ve lived in.

I’m not an expert of course but looking at the window it seems to be an insulation issue, but I’m scared that by trying to clean it I spread the spores and now I’ll get worse. I’m scared of it getting on our stuff in the bedroom and elsewhere, in our coffee maker, in the walls, in our vents, etc assuming it’s not already there.

We have another bedroom and there’s no mold on that window. 

I’ve since put in a maintenance request but it’s Saturday night so I doubt they’ll come until Monday morning. 

I’m at a loss as I’ve never dealt with this before and I feel so gross being in here right now and I’m worried about the health of our cat as well :( Any suggestions would be appreciated ",2,1759022068.0,Apartmentliving,1,1.0,False

1nsbh84,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1nsbh84/divorce_situation_am_i_just_a_friend_to_her_or_is/,Divorce situation — am I just a friend to her or is this an emotional affair?,"
It’s been almost 3 months that I’ve been talking to this woman at the gym. It all started when I approached her while doing cardio — just casual conversation. At the time, she mentioned she had a husband and kid. A few weeks later, we talked again and she told me she was “going through a divorce” but hadn’t actually filed yet.

I’ll be honest, I had a hard time believing her story because some of it didn’t add up. She said she was planning to move back into the city, work a part-time retail job, and somehow afford a place on her own with no roommates (rent would be like $3k+). At the same time, the way she talks about her husband makes it obvious she’s checked out — like she’s already over him.

A couple weeks ago, I took a break from her by switching to another gym. Earlier this week she texted me asking where I’d been, and I told her I was studying for my CPA exam and would reach out next week. She couldn’t even wait a week — two days later she randomly called me saying she hadn’t seen me at the gym and wanted to hear how I’d been. We ended up meeting up again for an hour of cardio.

On what basically felt like a coffee “date” at Starbucks, I straight up asked if she had been intimate with her husband, and she said not for years. I followed up by asking if they had an open relationship, and she said no — plus she wouldn’t date anyone until her divorce is finalized. I then asked her, “If your husband walked in here right now, how would he feel seeing us?” She said he’d be super pissed. That honestly threw me off, and it’s part of why I decided to take a 2-week break from her for safety purposes... btw they still live together with their kid

When we reconnected at the gym, we saw a couple working out and I mentioned being surprised she and her husband used to go to different gyms. She cut me off and corrected me — “ex-husband.” Then we shifted topics. I joked about how my parents are always bringing up finding me a wife back in Pakistan. That led into us talking about this whole “passport bros” thing (she had a funny story about people assuming she was one when she traveled).

Then the convo got deeper. She asked me about my “type,” and also if I ever had a gym crush. I just made something up about how back in college I had a gym crush and ended up in a FWB situation (different background so nothing serious). Then she asked me: if guys from my culture approached her, would they be serious or just looking for a hookup? I told her probably a hookup, since people usually marry within the same culture. We ended things lightheartedly — she joked she’ll probably just end up with a dog or cat.

So now I’m confused. My best friend says she’s just lonely and shy, and that I’m basically filling the role of a friend. But another friend told me this sounds more like an emotional affair.

**My questions:**

* Is there really such a thing as being “mentally divorced” before the papers are filed?
* Does this sound like just a friendship, or more like an emotional affair?
* If it is an emotional affair, how often do these lead to becoming physical?
* Given her situation (no separation filed, part-time income, big plans to move), how likely is it she’s actually serious about leaving her husband?

For context: I’m 27, she’s 35. She is definitely shy, and I admit she seems lonely. But some of the questions she asked me threw me off, especially her saying her husband would be pissed if he saw us. Am I overthinking this, or am I getting pulled into something deeper than just friendship?
