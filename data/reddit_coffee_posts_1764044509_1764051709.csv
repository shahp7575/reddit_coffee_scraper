\-2.3-second extraction, 18g in, 46.7g out.  
\-Preheat for 30 minutes to 1 hour; the cup is warmed on top of the machine.  
\-Puck prep- spray dose, into grinder \[Rancilio Rocky\], wdt, distribution, tamp, shot.  
\-Body of the shot is great, nice and full, mouth feel is velvety. The crema does not immediately dissipate and is structurally sound. There is still crema 4 minutes post pull.   
\-puck does not come out of the portafilter in one piece.

I occasionally pull amazing shots doing exactly the same thing with the exact same coffee. I can't explain the inconsistency I'm getting. When I've ground finer, the mouth feel and flavor have not been good, and often during the pull there's evidence of channeling, which I note due to spraying from the bottomless portafilter, which was not observed in this shot.

At the beginning of this year I graduated college and got a new job using my degree and much better pay. (like triple) However I honestly enjoyed my previous job so much better and was thinking about just picking up a couple shifts here and there just for fun. I know this sounds like a silly question but I don’t know I just wondered if anyone else has had a situation like this where it’s hard to move on from a high school/college job even though it’s probably for the better.

I’ve had her and her family over a couple of times for bbqs and she is always the first to leave. She has invited me to a few outings but always seems in a hurry. The last one was a 30 minute ticketed event that we spent time getting ready for and getting there and she didn’t want to hang out or even get coffee before/after. She also applied for a promotion that I applied to and didn’t tell me. I found out from someone else. It’s weird but she will talk to me about her life and marriage, etc and invite me to do things, but there is no real effort or depth and when we do have opportunities to hang out, she cuts it short. In any event, after a lot of thinking, I did not invite her to Friendsgiving this year because hosting is a lot of work and expensive. I think it’s rude to show up, eat, and leave asap. I feel guilty a bit but it’s Thanksgiving and I don’t want to deal with her obligatory appearance. I’d like to be closer friends but am not sure how or whether to try to bridge this gap.

They blocked my colleagues from using a toilet because it’s apparently only for “big doctors/ Bada Saheb” . They blocked JMS from drinking coffee from coffee machine in doctors room,"When some of my friends went to relax during a break and have a cup of coffee one Cardiologist consultant came and told them that they can’t use it 

The consultant told that it’s only for “Doctors”. When those guys told that they were also Doctors, the Consultant said that he only considers DM / MCH Doctors to be “real doctors” and rest are insignificant

All this for a 10-20 rupees coffee

When some junior MBBS MOs went to ask for salary hike because salary hasn’t been updated in the last 6 years the MO Incharge who himself is an MBBS grad told them that they’re paying MBBS doctors more than their “Aukaat” (level) and they deserve to be paid way less and he said that MBBS has to ideally change diapers and hold urine ports as per our qualifications and can’t request for any clinical exposure or salary hikes 

In one of the Mumbai hospitals I’ve seen on Cardiologist abuse and harass junior doctors so badly even when nothing is wrong. He came for rounds and started yelling at me for no reason. Then he asked me for T3,T4,TSh reports. 

The sisters hadn’t collected it but I had it pulled up on my phone so I told him the report values from the hospital supplied mobile app for investigations.

He started abusing me in his mother tongue and told “I don’t know where these uneducated lowlives come from” 

After abusing me asked me he just scribbled on the progress notes and left. He also used to abuse me if the computer slows down when he’s trying to add charges to the patient for consultation in the ward as if it was my mistake. He told the sisters that the junior doctors keep messing with the computers. 

I remember when one of my seniors got diagnosed with CAD and underwent PCI, he has taken a few days leave

The Assistant to my HOD (who just became his assistant because she was in an illegal relationship with him while the HOD was married to someone else) (she didn’t do any other course other than MBBS) was angry that the doctor got Medical Leave. 

She was like, “ why are we paying these guys while they’re sick and not working?”, “ we shouldn’t pay them but dismiss them and then re-hire them after they are well and shouldn’t offer any medical leaves”. 

I’ve been harassed and humiliated during internship for wearing good looking formal pants and Shirt. The SR’s ego got hurt and he made me push beds alone for CT scans and X Rays

On top of all of this doctors salaries are a joke in India now and we are prone to get beaten by most of the population who are brainwashed by movies and media to hate on anybody who is scientific and educated. India rewards the jobless, unproductive and rowdy gangs while the educated get humiliated, overworked and underpaid 

These same toxic guys become HOD, DEAN, DIRECTOR, IMA President , etc . Do you think they’ll do anything for the betterment of doctors ? lol

A lying politician or a dictator is anyday better than any of the doctor seniors that I’ve seen especially from southern states like TN and western states like GJ. These states have the most toxic senior doctors in India as per my experience.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **UEFA Champions League: Benfica vs. Ajax – A Match for the Ages (or at Least a Point)**  
*By Your Humble Sportswriter, Who Still Thinks the Ball is Round*

**The Setup:**  
Benfica and Ajax, two teams currently sitting at 0-4-0 in the group stage (because apparently, 0-4-0 is a thing in soccer), clash in a must-win showdown. The stakes? Survival. The drama? High. The odds? Let’s just say the bookmakers are throwing confetti for the underdog.

**The Numbers (Because We All Love a Good Spread):**

* **Moneyline:** Benfica is the slight favorite at **+2.00** (implied probability: 50%), while Ajax sits at **+3.70** (27%). The draw? A cozy **+3.50** (28.57%).
* **Spread:** Benfica -0.5 (1.81–2.05 odds), Ajax +0.5 (1.89–2.05). Basically, it’s a 50-50 toss-up whether either team can avoid a loss.
* **Totals:** Over 2.5 goals is the pick at **1.70–1.91**, while Under 2.5 is a less exciting **2.12–2.15**.

**Why Benfica Might Win (or Why You Should Bet on Them):**  
José Mourinho promised to bring Rodrigo Rêgo into the squad, which is either a masterstroke or a desperate Hail Mary. Benfica’s attack?

The issue is that I’m in school, and have classes the entire weekday, and I’m only available Saturday and Sunday. This will be the case for the next year as well. I can do open, midday and close shifts, but only Saturday and Sunday. And I don’t think I’m able to make the 18 hr mark.. my classes are stem oriented and very work/lab heavy, and takes up a lot of hours per week. The large gap I have during the day before one class is spent doing homework/prep for another class, and right after that other class, the large gap after is spent doing homework/prep for the previous class.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

# **Proof of work**
## **The team**
At Kraken, onchain data isn’t just numbers, it’s the pulse of crypto. The Onchain team lives where code meets capital, turning raw blockchain data into insight, strategy, and alpha.
We’re looking for a Data Analyst, Onchain, a true degen who’s fluent in wallets, mempools, and market structure, and who can translate that intuition into data models and dashboards that shape how Kraken builds and trades onchain.
If you decompile smart contracts for fun, monitor DEX volume before coffee, and have opinions about MEV, this is your scene. You’ll help Kraken understand where liquidity lives, how capital moves, and what signals the next trade, product, or market entry.
## **The opportunity**
  * Partner with product, trading, and data teams to uncover insights across the full onchain user journey from first trade to long-term retention.
  * Build and maintain datasets capturing wallet activity, liquidity movement, feature usage, and trading behavior.
  * Design metrics and dashboards in dbt and BI tools that reveal trends in user growth, engagement, and trading activity.
  * Analyze funnels, LTV, and retention metrics to inform product strategy and optimize user experience.
  * Investigate onchain signals ( wallet clustering, transaction flow, and capital allocation) to identify growth opportunities.
  * Develop frameworks to attribute trading performance and ROI across products, markets, and user segments.
  * Collaborate with engineers to scale onchain data pipelines and improve data quality and accessibility.
  * Communicate insights clearly and visually, translating complex blockchain data into simple, actionable stories.


## **Skills you should HODL**
  * 3+ years in product or trading analytics, ideally within crypto, fintech, or data-driven trading environments.
  * Strong grasp of onchain fundamentals — wallets, DEXs, liquidity, bridges, and token mechanics.
  * Proficiency in SQL, Python (pandas, matplotlib, plotly), and dbt for modeling and analysis.
  * Capable of creating intuitive dashboards and visualizations to communicate complex insights clearly
  * Familiarity with onchain data sources (Dune, Flipside, Nansen, APIs, or subgraphs).
  * Proven ability to measure user behavior and product health through LTV, retention, funnel, and engagement metrics.
  * Strong communicator who can align data insights with product and trading strategies.
  * You’re crypto-native — curious, analytical, and hands-on with the tools and products you analyze.


## **Nice to haves**
  * Experience modeling MEV flows, liquidity provisioning, or token distribution mechanics.
  * Exposure to algo trading, onchain market-making, or portfolio attribution systems.
  * Contributions to open-source DeFi analytics or onchain dashboards.

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for the vinyl weekend pass shows on 11/26, 11/28, and 11/29. the broadway/capitol hill area around club vinyl is honestly a nightmare to park in when there's a big multi-day event like this, so a little planning is clutch.  
  
first thing's first: the local insider move is to check out Prked. it's an app where people rent out their private driveways or garages right next to the venue . it's often a short walk, way cheaper than the day-of lots, and lets you skip the worst of the traffic bottleneck on broadway entirely by parking a block over .  
  
if you prefer a formal garage, your best bet is to pre-book a spot online using a service like spothero or parkchirp . this is super smart because it guarantees your spot and price, which helps a lot since they raise rates for big event nights . solid, close options are the evans east lot (1120 acoma st), which is cheap around $7.99 , and the chancery garage (1120 lincoln st), around $8.99 . there are a ton of other nearby structures too, like the 1065 lincoln lot, the 1081 lincoln st lot, and the art garage (1200 lincoln) .  
  
for the brave souls going the street parking route, you can often find decent spots if you head south down broadway or dive into the residential side streets about 1 to 3 blocks away from vinyl . you could try the diagonal spots near 11th avenue by metropolis coffee or even go further over towards santa fe if you don't mind a longer walk . just make absolutely sure you feed the meter correctly using the paybyphone app —denver is super aggressive with tickets and you do not want one of those ridiculous private lot non-compliance fees . also, avoid those temporary “cash only, twenty bucks to park” lots with guys collecting money in the lot; locals say those spots can feel sketchy and it's better to stick with a proper garage or marked street spot .  
  
get there on the early side if you're trying for the popular street spots or the closest lots—they fill up fast . the worst of the traffic from the event crowd will be between 9:00 pm and 10:30 pm, since the show starts late at 10:00 pm . a final heads up: if you end up on a dark side street, maybe bring a steering wheel lock for peace of mind, just an extra precaution . hope this helps and you have a sick weekend.",1,1764050792.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

Between the waiting in line, the Rs. 250+ price tag, and the hassle of getting there, your ""coffee break"" often feels more like a chore.

But for us coffee lovers, compromising on flavor isn't an option. We want that rich, nutty aroma and that smooth, velvety finish—something generic instant coffee just doesn't deliver.

The good news? The [instant coffee](https://www.kettleberry.in/shop) game in India has changed. You no longer need an expensive espresso machine or a barista certification to enjoy a gourmet cup. Here is how you can upgrade your morning ritual and why making the switch to premium hazelnut instant coffee is the best decision you’ll make this year.

https://preview.redd.it/zedwugpfgc3g1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff63139f15992eb4a20cca00966d9da8ce75f145

# Why Hazelnut? The Comfort Flavor We Crave

There is a reason hazelnut is one of the most ordered flavors globally. It pairs perfectly with the natural bitterness of coffee beans, adding a layer of roasted, buttery sweetness that feels like a warm hug in a mug.

Unlike sugary syrups that mask the taste of bad coffee, a high-quality hazelnut infusion enhances the bean's natural profile. It’s indulgent without being heavy—perfect for a morning wake-up call or a mid-afternoon dessert substitute.

# The Secret is in the Bean (Not the Chicory)

If you have tried making flavored coffee at home and it tasted ""watery"" or ""burnt,"" the culprit was likely the beans.

Most commercial instant coffees in India are a mix of Robusta beans (which can be harsh) and chicory (a root filler used to cut costs). To get that true cafe experience, you need to look for **100% Arabica coffee**. Arabica beans are grown at higher altitudes, resulting in a smoother, more complex flavor profile with zero bitterness.

This is where brands like [**Kettleberry** ](https://www.kettleberry.in/)are revolutionizing the market. By using Grade-AAA Arabica beans and infusing them with natural hazelnut flavors, they eliminate the need for chicory or added sugars. You get a pure, clean cup that dissolves instantly but tastes like it was brewed for minutes.

# Recipe: The ""2-Minute Barista"" Hazelnut Latte

Ready to ditch the cafe queue? Here is the fool-proof recipe for a cafe-style latte right in your kitchen.

**What you need:**

* 1 tsp **Kettleberry Hazelnut Instant Coffee**
* 1 cup Milk (Dairy, Oat, or Almond work best)
* 1 tsp Sugar or Honey (Optional—the hazelnut adds a natural sweetness!)
* Ice cubes (for the cold version)

**Instructions:**

1. **The Mix:** Add the coffee powder and sweetener to your cup. Add a splash of warm water and stir until dissolved. You’ll immediately smell the roasted hazelnut aroma.
2. **The Froth:** If you have a frother, whisk your milk until creamy. If not, shake your milk in a jar for 30 seconds before pouring.
3. **The Pour:** Pour the milk over your coffee base.
   * *Hot:* Pour gently for a creamy latte.
   * *Cold:* Pour over a glass full of ice for a refreshing Hazelnut Frappe.

# Where to Find the Real Deal?

You don’t need to scour gourmet grocery stores to find premium blends anymore. The freshest batches are often found online, directly from the roasters who prioritize quality over mass production.

If you are ready to elevate your mornings, you can[ **buy hazelnut instant coffee powder online in India**](https://www.kettleberry.in/product/buy-hazelnut-instant-coffee) directly from Kettleberry.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

You're probably wondering whether to grab a laptop stand or invest in an adjustable height desk. Let's break down both options so you can figure out what works best for your setup.

## The Quick Answer

A laptop stand wins for most people because it's affordable, portable, and gets the job done. An adjustable height desk is great if you want to switch between sitting and standing throughout the day, but it's a bigger investment.

## Why Laptop Stands Are Pretty Awesome

Laptop stands elevate your screen to eye level, which stops you from looking down all day. This simple fix can seriously reduce neck strain and back pain. They're lightweight, fit in a backpack, and work anywhere - your bedroom, coffee shop, or dorm room.

The best part? They're budget-friendly. You can find quality ergonomic laptop stands for under $50. If you want to check out some solid options, [here's where you can browse different laptop stands](https://athomewave.com/laptop-stand) that fit various needs and budgets.

Most portable laptop stands fold flat and weigh less than a pound. You can pair them with any regular desk you already own, plus an external keyboard and mouse for a complete ergonomic workstation.

## What About Adjustable Height Desks?

Standing desks let you alternate between sitting and standing, which keeps your body moving. They take up the same space as a regular desk and can help with circulation and energy levels.

The downside? They cost anywhere from $200 to $1,000+. They're also heavy and stay in one spot. If you're renting or move around a lot, that's something to consider.

## Which One Should You Get?

Go with a laptop stand if you want an affordable ergonomic setup that travels with you. Perfect for students, remote workers, or anyone who works in different locations.

Choose an adjustable desk if you have a permanent workspace, want the sitting-standing flexibility, and can spend a few hundred bucks.

## The Bottom Line

Both options improve your posture and comfort, but laptop stands offer the best value for most people. They solve the main problem - getting your screen at the right height - without breaking the bank. You can always upgrade to a standing desk later if you want.

Ive struggled a bit with falling asleep my whole life but like… I’ve gotten used to it. I have ADHD (diagnosed but unmedicated) and I believe it’s cause of that. I usually take melatonin cause of it (usually 2.5 mg, but ive upped that to 5 mg lately) to fall asleep. 

But lately I’ve been struggling to sleep a lot more. The past month or so I keep waking up during the night. Multiple times, and there’s never any reason for me to be waking up. And some nights its almost impossible to actually fall asleep. And nothing works to KEEP me asleep. I took 2 tylenol pm’s yesterday (which will usually absolutely knock me out). I woke up 8 times during the night, one of which for just under an hour. It took me 2 hours after taking it to fall asleep when it usually takes about 45 minutes. I just want to fall and stay asleep. Its exhuasting and annoying.

I don’t drink coffee often. It doesn’t work cause of my ADHD so I only drink it ocasionally for the taste. I have a good diet. I go to the gym. I don’t know what could be causing my restlessness. Please help. Thx.",1,1764050184.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

FADE IN:



INT. VOID OF NOTHINGNESS – UNKNOWN TIME



A deep, cliché narrator voice cuts through and does the cliche narrator describes the world while nothing is one screen



NARRATOR (V.O.)

Long ago...



A young GIRL (around 8) interrupts, curious and impatient.



GIRL (O.S.)

How long?



The NARRATOR sighs, disappointed.



NARRATOR (V.O.)

Between the clicking noise the sun started making, and the scientist who discovered inter-dimensional travel and used it to be a bad influence on his grandson.

Now, may I continue?



GIRL (O.S.)

I guess.



Another sigh. He’s losing patience.



NARRATOR (V.O.)

Kids these days... Not that there are many fleshy ones left.

(clears throat)

Ahem.



EXT. FANTASY WORLD – DAY



A beautiful, vibrant fantasy landscape appears. The camera FLIES through it, bumping into rocks, rustling through tall grass, and zooming over glowing rivers. But the camera is piloting terribly



NARRATOR (V.O.)

There was a world... populated by creatures of wonder and mythical rules...

But it was programmed. Also who programmed this damn thing?! 



The horizon glitches and peels away with an array of light blue squares, revealing a massive QUEUE of SCI-FI CHARACTERS waiting beneath towering GUARDS with high-tech weapons.



A YOUNG BOY blurts out, interrupting again.



BOY (O.S.)

What do you mean by that? 



The NARRATOR sighs louder — this time, truly irritated.



NARRATOR (V.O.)

Shut up and listen!



His tone drips with disdain. The GIRL snaps back.



GIRL (O.S.)

You don’t tell us what to do, fossil!



The NARRATOR SCREAMS. A sci-fi BLAST echoes. Chaos erupts — laser noises, explosions, the sound of energy weapons clashing.



A WHOOSH cuts through the noise. The BOY shouts in protest.



BOY (O.S.)

HEY, NO ROCKET BOOTS!!



NARRATOR (V.O.)

Heh... heheh... HEYAA!







The chaos of the OS battle fades away.



A vast mechanical waiting queue stretches endlessly. Three people are assigned to each other.



DIESEL, an adrenaline junkie chasing the thrill of “true adventure.” He’s pure chaos and hatred for the normal (AKA Zareek)



SARAH, a young woman who’s left the complex world behind — she hates politics. She’s pure nihilism 



ZAREEK, a man in his thirties who tagged along with Diesel and Sarah to escape the feeling that everyone back home was better than him. He’s pure “When can I get back to the couch?”

INT. DAY — WAITING QUEUE



Sarah stands in front of a guard. Her eyes glow blue, revealing the eyeball inside her skull — she’s being scanned.



The guard’s eyes flicker with the same glow as he completes the scan.



A loud CLANKING OF METAL ON METAL echoes through the queue.



A massive spider-like robot stomps into view, its upper body humanoid, its legs metallic and sharp. It’s movements are speedy and frantic.



ROBOT

(toneless)

Terrorist spotted.



Its arm transforms into a massive cannon, locking onto Sarah.



The guard steps in front of the beam.



GUARD

Whoa, whoa, calm down clanker!



His eyes flash again, projecting a holographic image of Sarah’s identification papers.



GUARD

She’s not a terrorist!



The robot hesitates, its mechanical face twisting — confused, then oddly… sad.



ROBOT

I am sorry for the potentially dangerous son-ar-io.

I will head to the reprogramming cen-tre.



The strange annunciation of its words sends a chill down Zareek’s spine.



The familiar CLANK CLANK CLANK of its legs fades away.



GUARD

(grumbling)

Fucking circuit chewing cog creature...

(then, louder)

Alright, head through.



He gestures toward the fantasy realm beyond the gate.



EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS – DAY

 

DIESEL’S HAND brushes frantically across the frame, wiping away the previous scene like dust. The image dissolves into a cloud, which is shown to be ZAREEK’S FLASHBACK.



The trio rides on a carriage clattering down a dirt path.



ZAREEK

What gives?!



DIESEL

Your flashbacks are STUPID, and it doesn’t help that your ANNOYING cursed amulet makes us see them! So STOP reminiscing about something that was ONLY A MONTH AGO!!! 



ZAREEK

You know, while we’re here, we don’t have to do things the right way. We can be a little lazy. And my amulet is fashionable! 



DIESEL

Tch.



The carriage stops abruptly.



The CARRIAGE DRIVER turns, his booming southern drawl echoing.



CARRIAGE DRIVER

Well, here ye stop!!



The trio steps off and heads into a bustling city square filled with color, sound, and life.



DIESEL

Why are we here again?



SARAH

We ran out of AH-pehels. So we’re here to buy AH-pehels. We’re going to trade coin for AH-pehel.



DIESEL

Please stop pronouncing “apple” like that.



SARAH

No.



DIESEL walks up to a nearby fruit vendor after passing shops like: “Ye Olde Tax Fraud” – sells fake ledgers and discount shell companies. “Potions R Us” – everything’s labeled “probably healing.” “Target (Actual Target)” – archery range disguised as a department store. “Reincarnation Station” – 10% off if you died stupidly.“Spoiler Scrolls” – fortune teller spoils upcoming plot twists for gold.“Goblin King’s Wings” – slogan: “We kidnapped the flavor!”“Tavern & Error” – glitchy sign constantly flickers 404 ALE NOT FOUND.“Yeast Mode Bakery” – tagline: “Bread stronger than your dad.”“Coffee & Consequences” – baristas in full executioner gear.

“Frogurt of the Gods” – mascot: an actual frog screaming in divine ecstasy.“Apple Store (not that one)” – they literally just sell apples. Bad ones.

“Quest Diagnostics” – “Get tested for plot relevance.” “Wish.com — Literal Edition” – everything you buy comes cursed.“Rent-a-Sidekick” – hourly charge, no refunds if they die heroically.“Therapy for Sentient Blades” – lobby full of whispering swords.“Cloud 9 Storage” – ethereal vapor warehouse for rent.“Fantasy DMV” – line of dragons renewing flight licenses.“The Loan Ranger” – one masked guy aggressively offering microloans.

“iScroll” – overpriced magic tablets, 1% more battery life than a rock.“Runescape Repair” – actual runes being hammered by goblins.“A.I. (Actual Imps)” – small creatures yelling ideas at businessmen.“Department of Unfinished Quests” – filled with people waiting eternally.“Ministry of Overcompensation” – all employees wear massive pauldrons.”Fantasy HOA” – bans dragons, noise, and emotional expression.“Local Oracle Union” – picketing with signs saying “THE END IS NEAR (AGAIN).”“Taxidermy & Taxes” – “We skin your wallet too!”“The Existential Deli” – every sandwich questions its purpose.“Used Dreams” – shelves of glowing, slightly depressed orbs “The Pun Forge” – blacksmiths only make weapons with pun names.

Btw if this is trimmed you animators HAVE to put a sign in the background saying: “Couldn’t fit all visual gags :( -Kai”



DIESEL

Do you have apples?



A brash lady in a Russian accent is lighting a cigarette behind the booth.



LADY

I’m busy.



DIESEL

OK. You’re not supposed to have a cig though. This is fantasy IDIOT



DIESEL walks around bored as all hell and notices a wanted poster for a goblin building a bio weapon that would turn all life forms into goblins. The Goblin is disgusting and repulsive. The freak is also dancing in one of the paintings on the poster



“WANTED ALIVE SO WE CAN TORTURE THAT FUCKER! don’t ask how he’s dancing in a painting. His freaky knows no bounds” The poster reads.



DIESEL

Y’all should see this! 



The other two strut over to DIESEL.



ZAREEK

5,000 gold?! If its worth that much it must be hard work… You sure? 

DIESEL

NONSENSE! This is easy gold! 

SARAH

If it gets political I’m out. It also better be a grounded simple adventure. No crazy shit. 



DIESEL

And when we get back we buy our AH-pehels.



SARAH and ZAREEK look confused.



DIESEL

Yeah and now you realize how bad a joke that was, SAR-RAH. 



SARAH looks mildly annoyed



SARAH

Whatever…



The TRIO starts walking from door to door asking people if they’ve seen the GOBLIN in a minute long montage. The montage ends and they’re in a forest.



SARAH kicks a pebble. It screams and sprouts legs, scurrying away.



SARAH

This quest sucks.



ZAREEK

Pppppfffffttt…… Can we do something else? This is so boring it’s unholy.



SARAH

Yeah, if Zareek thinks something is lame it’s either the best or the absolute worst. And I’m going with worst.



DIESEL

Oh, com’on! This is real adventure. 



SARAH

Dude…. We’re in a forest looking for a goblin that we’re not allowed to kill... This sucks ass. 



As SARAH is speaking a GRIFFIN flies away with a living and screaming mushroom that it plucked off a tree. ZAREEK hears that and looks behind to see it happen while SARAH is just about done with her sentence.



DIESEL

Well, I like sucking ass 



A cluster of TREES stop rustling, turn their bark-faces, and look at DIESEL like he just said the corniest thing in the entire forest. One mutters, “Wow… brother thinks he’s spicy.” Another whispers, “Someone get this man a personality.” A third snorts, “I’ve seen liches smoother than that.” Another goes, “Can somebody please show him the way OUT of the forest?” And lastly one cackles “Somebody tell that guy his third grader humor is not tuff.”



SARAH

Gross



DIESEL

Shut and be patient. 



ZAREEK

Guys I just saw a GRIFFIN.. Yeah, A GRIFFIN. Eat a LIVING MUSHROOM. Also I thought Diesel’s thing was to be an adrenaline junkie… Why are you defending this “adventure”?



DIESEL looks like he’s at his wits end. 



DIESEL

Okay…. Let’s just go to a few more doors. Mmkay?



SARAH crosses her arms. 



SARAH

Fine.



DIESEL Sighs and points to a fairy tale looking hut.



DIESEL 

Let’s head into this fairy tale-esque hut. 



ZAREEK

Cool



The TRIO walks up to the door and knock. An elderly woman answers. The woman licks her lips by flicking her tongue like a lizard REALLY quickly and it’s freakish to watch.



Woman

HELLOOOO deeries! How may me helping youuoououououououou?! 



SARAH interrupts her.



SARAH

That’s enough. No one should pronounce you like that.



DIESEL

Ahem,. We’re looking for a goblin-



The elder woman interrupts joyfully



Woman

OOOOHHHHHH! I know! You see, I’m an elder god and I’m omniscient and that gobly is over 13 Nimnoots there, then take a left at 65 feet, when you’ve gone 0.0005 miles take a right then at 0.03 meters over there you’ll see him. 



The woman’s face distorts and her teeth become sharp and creepy looking.



Woman

OH, AND ALSO,, if you stop by Gleebglorb’s house, tell ‘em to stop texting me. We had our divorce like 13 years ago.



The tiro exchange glances then it cuts to black and then shows the trio walking through the forest using the woman’s instructions.



DIESEL Is yelling at the others



DIESEL

Fuck y’all! (Semi incoherent babbling) LOOK WHO WAS RRRRIIIIIIIIIGHT!! DIESEL!! I’MMMM the best. Y’ALL ARE DUMB AND WERE WHINNING!! I’M BETTER THAN YOU COCKSUCKERS- 



SARAH interrupts his rant



SARAH

Can you please shut up? You shot our swear count up like 300. We’re not Rick And Morty.



ZAREEK

Heeeyyy that’s the second time we mentioned them.



SARAH and DIESEL look annoyed

SARAH & DIESEL 

SCREW YOU ZARREEK.



SARAH & DIESEL become not understandable as they say different things to diss ZAREEK.



The scene cuts to them at the location the insane woman told them to go



EXT. FOREST CLEARING – DAY – BUNKER



The trio stands before the structure.

It’s just a plain metal bunker. No magic. No glow. No runes. Just a bunker with a steel door in the dirt. There are some vines on it but nothing other than that.



ZAREEK

(confused)

It’s… just a bunker.



SARAH spins toward him like he just kicked a puppy.



SARAH

“Just a bunker?” JUST a bunker?! We’re in a fantasy world, you braindead fruit snack! A bunker is basically an extinction-level event of weirdness! IDIOT!!



Diesel recoils like she just slapped him.



DIESEL

Whoa— okay, that was… kinda a lot, Sarah.





SARAH

…Shit…. You’re right.

I still hate you, Zareek. You give off “eats crayons” energy.



Zareek just sighs



ZAREEK

Stop fucking around, lets get this door open.



The camera cuts to black and fades with Zareek opening the door. When this happens, the characters switch to rotoscope and their eyes squint weirdly. The camera then cuts to what the trio is looking at: A bunch of goblins are in a makeshift lab that looks out of Breaking Bad with three goblins in the back watching Breaking Bad and directing the others to imitate it perfectly. One goblin stirs blue goop while checking the show to make sure they’re doing it “right,” and tries to get it the correct color and and grabs a bottle of bleach and shakes it in frantically but it’s empty and he looks inside the bottle with tears in his eyes. One goblin is dressed as Walter White. It’s such a poor attempt though he looks like Adolf Hitler and other goblins stare in disgust. Two goblins are snickering about the “Walter White.” 



Goblin 1

Is it-No it can’t just be me. That Walter White looks like Hitler, doesn’t he? 



The other goblin speaks out in a guttural and deep voice



Goblin 2

Yeah, y-yeah. He does. You’re not wrong, Jasmin.



Jasmin sounds even angrier and points at “Walter White.”



Jasmin

Look, he even got a ketchup stain on his arm!



Goblin 2

Yeah it looks like an armband. I-I-I-I-I-I-W-W-W-W-We have to tell him



Jasmin

Agreed.



SARAH

(sucks air in through her teeth — the universal “yikes” sound)

Lets just kill ‘em, right? 



The others nod. 



ZAREEK

Mmhm. 



DIESEL

Yeah, I mean, nobody wants to tell some their shirt is inside out let alone that their accidentally dressed as……. Ya know…

It’s gotten to where I can barely order coffee or answer a question a store worker asks me.
I don’t have any friends or connections because I feel afraid of everyone. Hate phone calls too and I can only type messages.

Because of that mismatch, I’m not sure if partnering up is going to work . Naisip ko din lng na if things between us can go back to how they were after this

Context: 
•	Me + my boyfriend are planning a small coffee & matcha pop-up. almost every day nag titimpla kame and nageexperiment ng drinks. Nakita ko yung sarili ko na nageenjoy ako sa ginagawa ko. And this idea comes up after our trip to vietnam also with my friends. 
•	I already own most of the equipment. 
•	I told the idea to my friends and gusto ko sila iinvolve. Pero nung tumagal I’ve realized I don’t feel the same drive from them. Kasi una wala naman silang equipments and all. Pumupunta sila dito sa apartment namin to try yung mga drinks na gagawin ko. 
•	And yung responsibility ng bawat isa hati siya ako mostly yung may alam ng drinks ako din yung nageedit ng logo and pang posting. Yung isa magtitimpla din yung isa mostly siya yung sa social media and cashier. 
•	Our pop-up date is set for December 2nd week. But I’m not sure things are aligned enough for everyone to pull their weight. Ayoko naman magresent kapag tumagal kasi mas madami akong gagawin and mostly yung resources samin ng bf ko we also have the car for transportation.

Previous Attempts:

I just brought up the issue of profit-sharing very recently and I know it probably should have been said earlier.

•	I proposed that me + my BF handle the pop-up ourselves for now, because of how much we’ve already invested
•	Also I tried to explain when it comes to profit is big deal for me kasi pano mo masusustain yung business if hindi yon nag mamatter sayo. 
•	But one friend pushed back, saying profit “shouldn’t matter so much” and she says parang this is for fun and gusto nya lng magtinda tinda. And the other friend told me na sana sinabi ng maaga hindi yung may mga plano and all na. Gets ko naman and mali talaga ako don. Lately naiisip ko nadin sabihin sakanila pero ayoko sirain yung nabuo naming plano. Siguro hinanap ko lng din talaga yung same drive sa pagtitimpla kasi as of now kame lng naman yung may equipments. And yung magiging profit is divide by 4 pero yung gagawin ng bawat isa is hindi naman same.

But consistency doesn’t start when the market opens, it starts with what you do before it.

Here’s my exact morning routine that keeps me sharp and emotionally neutral before every trading session:



4:30 AM – Wake Up (2 hrs before market open)

Just movement, get vertical, hydrate, and reset.



4:40 AM – Cold shower

Instantly wake up the body. Reminds me I’m in control before the market even opens.



4:50 AM – Light cardio or stretching (15-20 min)

Nothing crazy. Just enough to get blood flowing and mind alert. A moving body makes for a focused trader. I do have sciatica issues, so I do focus a lot on back and hip mobility.



5:15 AM – Breathwork (4-7-8 pattern, 10 cycles) or (4-4-4-4 box breathing)

Inhale 4 sec



Hold 7 sec



Exhale 8 sec

It’s simple, but it flips your nervous system from reactive to calm, which is where all good trading happens.



6:00 AM – Black coffee + silence

No screens yet. I let caffeine hit while staying off stimulation.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

My friend (male in his 30s) has been with his partner (male in his 20s) for under a year.

They’ve had issues from very early on (my friend caught his boyfriend still on dating apps, and on another occasion caught him out trying to buy a substance he was meant to have quit with the dealer conveniently being his ex).

I’ve dated manipulative people myself so could tell instantly that this guy was using lies and emotional manipulation to flip blame onto my friend who easily internalises blame in situations like this.

But no amount of logic could convince him that his partners reasons for both these things were lies.

I ended up limiting the level of advice I’d give after that because it didn’t seem helpful. But I worried this would create a perfect environment for this guy to isolate my friend from everyone and so gradually started making more effort and eventually met the partner.

Cut to now, we had a nice night for my friends bday that his partner had organised. All seemed well but after everyone left, the partner allegedly choked my friend. 

So I went around to take my friend for coffee, he said he was definitely choked, and that he was going to talk to the partner first and then take up my offer to come stay with me.

I wasn’t there for that convo but after that my friend has started changing his tune about it. Saying it was actually an accident and that the bf just ‘pressed his forearm into my neck accidentally because he was trying to get my phone’. And as usual, the partner is flipping this now to say that my friend overreacted which led to their housemate (who overheard things) filing a police report. 

The cops came but both my friend and his partner denied it so it went nowhere. The partner is now making himself out to be the victim and my friend is falling for it.

My friend still spent the night at my place but I could just tell he was shifting from feeling like the victim to feeling as though he was at fault. No amount of telling him he is not at fault changed anything. Now the partner isnt even willing to admit that he choked my friend by accident, he’s straight up gaslighting him by saying nothing happened.

But regardless my friend went back home the next day and now it seems like they’re going to try and have space but in seperate rooms at the same apartment.

I know full well I can’t save someone who doesn’t want to be saved. But with this alleged violence in the back of my mind I can’t help but worry that taking a step back could be giving up too easily. I’m trying not to be pushy but I also don’t know how else to handle this without entertaining any of these lies or excuses or delusions that the relationship is salvageable.

Tl;dr my friend has walked back a claim that his partner choked him. I feel uncomfortable with them staying together but don’t want to overstep or pester my friend to see reason. What, if anything, can I do to help him wake up and leave?

I’m a 33-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

Thanks!",0,1764048997.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,0.5,False
1p64fc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1p64fc6/former_best_friend_distanced_herself_from_me_and/,former best friend distanced herself from me and is now saying it's our fault. i want to cut her off.,"problem/goal: should i cut off my friend?

context: i'm 3rd year in college, and been friends with this girl since our freshman year. we were originally 4 in our friend group, including 2 other boys. she has the horrible habit of freeloading and procrastinating things that are way past the deadline. sometimes she'd do homework that were due a month before and the submission bins are no longer open, but she would email the teachers her submissions. now, our friend group grew to add 4 more people, all girls. this has been happening for a while, since her highschool days from what her mother told me.

i've tried everything for her because i used to fail my senior high and now i'm doing my best to make it up in college. i've tried reminding her about homeworks and quizzes constantly, i've done her homework for her at some points, let her freeload in some group works because she said she wasn't feeling mentally well, and it reached a point where she would pay me to do her assignments but she wouldn't even pay me on time. she'd buy expensive personal items and delay her payments, even paying in installments. i've had 3 interventions with her, where me and my male friend would sit her down and talk about her work ethic affecting our grades as high achievers. she would always do the same thing, cry, say sorry about her work even though she's trying her best, and then say she'll do better next term or semester. then she'd avoid us for a few days. during our midterms on our last semester for 2nd year, she pulled down my grade so bad due to her late replies and late submissions for group works. i really cried. i told her that i'd be more strict with her, and around that time i'd start to message her mother if she wasn't replying, was late to class (my class rep or teachers always asked me where she was), or had missings. i was really ruthless around that time, because i felt like i was at the point of someone just actively abusing my kindness and my urge to help others since our 2nd year was nearing it's end and it was already the 3rd year of our friendship. she knew how important my grades were to me.

additionally, her mother is a stay at home wife, with her dad being a seaman. her boyfriend is a foreigner living in the PH and can't enroll in college, but the same age as us due to discrimination. she had HIM doing her work when it wasn't me. before her mother, i'd involve her boyfriend because they were usually on a discord call together since they lived cities away. whenever i talked to him, he'd tell me that he'll do her work instead because she was crying or having a mental breakdown due to the pile of schoolworks she has. the term where she pulled down my grade, she had her boyfriend do her late groupworks, and after nonstop messaging teachers about how she wasn't contributing, i told one of the professors that her boyfriend was doing her works. she ended up failing 2 classes because that prof recieved other complaints about her and handled 2 of our subjects.

me and my male friend have told her that since our 3rd year started, we will no longer assist her with any academics. we really did everything for her, outside of academics. we're not really rich students, but since she's an only child she gets a lot of money. her boyfriend also gives her a hefty allowance since he doesn't go to college. whenever she'd talk about wanting a drinks we'd suggest pick up coffee and she'd complain it's too far. when we wanted to go to the mall, we asked to commute and she hated na siksikan dun. when she wanted to save money to buy certain products, we'd suggest that she eats with us near a palengke with many restaurants, but complained that the food made her stomach hurt (we ate the same things) and never came back after the first time. if she didn't eat and said she has no money, i'd buy her food despite my small allowance. i really did everything for her, like a mom. my male friend wanted to stop at an earlier time before the 2nd semester of our 2nd year started, but i really insisted she just needed a little more push when it was far from that.

now, we don't really avoid her. she's distanced herself from us and is saying that we were the ones that cut her off. her new friend that she's latched on are the new people that joined our friend group, she walks with them to pick up coffee, she talks to them about how she thinks we don't like her, and it makes me so mad to think she's trying to better academically now. how come when me and my friend did everything for her, she didn't change? how come she's saying we distanced when she did that first? my genuine actions that i put so much effort into for 2 years are being twisted all because i set boundaries. the times where i helped but she refused to move felt like emotional abuse or manipulation. i have a really soft heart, and for the start of the 3rd year i chose myself instead of others this time, and that's being attacked.

additionally, because me and my friend are poorer than her, she indirectly judges where we eat. we choose to eat at karenderya because we can't afford to eat mcdonalds or go to starbucks as often as she does. when i tell her i bought 1 gun skin from a bundle because i can't afford the bundle, she immediately tells me that she's about to buy the entire bundle. she once asked me why im not going to a concert that her mother paid 18K for, and i can't even reach 12k within 6 months of saving my baon.

she's telling her ""new friends"" this: ""cuz for them they stripped me away fully eh. sayo i rlly feel like your there even tho i do my assignments alone."" her friends tell me what she says about me and my friend, they tell us that they're annoyed about her work ethic and that she removed me and my friend from her close friends sa instagram despite her still being on our lists.

we don't take academic problems personally because they're still our friends, but for some reason she does. we've informed her before that we still want to be her friend but can't help her with academic related problems. now, she's taking it personally.

i so badly want to confront her about the things she said to our friends about me and my male friends, but i don't know if it's a good idea to cut her off because our friend group are also close friends with her. the things she's saying are hurting my heart because i really tried all my efforts with her, and she takes it another way.",2,1764048954.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False

Hey everyone, I'm hitting a sourcing wall for my new cafe. I have a great local coffee roaster, but I'm struggling to find a dedicated wholesale matcha supplier. I want the quality  to be real good, as matcha lattes are a huge part of our menu concept.
I've been comparing a few options. I got samples from my general food service distributor, and the matcha was  not great. I also got a sample from a smaller online supplier, One With Tea, and the quality (color, taste) was better. My concern is relying on a smaller, specialist company for a core product. For those of you who've built a strong matcha program, have you had good experiences with niche suppliers like this?",2,1764048866.0,smallbusiness,2,1.0,False
1p64e7q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p64e7q,Contraste (*) Milan,"Been wanting to go here for quite some time. 

Did the riflessioni menu which I only saw another 2 tables get out of our whole seating. I kinda get it, the restaurant has some signature hits that you’d want to get. Part of me even wishes I had done the riflesso but it seemed to be more in the spirit of the restaurant to go with the more far-out option. 

First few dishes I was a little skeptical. Further than that I wondered whether or not the meal would even approach my lofty expectations. By the time I hit the first fish course of Bonito, marrow, plankton and sauerkraut I was feeling pretty immersed. 

I think you go and try this if you want to buy in. Big time buy in. Basically I was closing my eyes the whole time and trying to synthesize whatever was on the plate, disregarding the constituent parts, and trying to taste each dish as a single thought or memory. Something to consider, they asked something of you. This may not be everyone’s idea of a good time/spend.

The menu fostered this notion well. Mid-meal tasting the baba… which had been soaked in orange wine, paired with a glass of the same orange wine, and dry ingredients served in a glass to mimic scent profile of that wine was in no way subtle. 

Not to say it was unwelcome. I really appreciated the invitation to freak out a bit. These people are letting it fly. 

12ᵗʰ NOVEMBER 2025

Hops, grapefruit, basil seeds, fusillone and parmesan
Plantain, pakchoi and oysters
Green beans, strawberry and dulse
Atlantic bonito, bone marrow, plankton and sauerkraut
Mango, lobster, coffee and olives
Chestnut, prosciutto and tuna bottarga
Pork, black cabbage, peanuts and wasabi
Pineapple, potatoes and coffee
Peanuts, tendons, caviar, passionfruit and roast
Bread and orange wine
Watermelon, clams and chicken
Veal liver, lavender, kimchi and pine nuts
Canard, tomato, bergamot and beans
Macambo, corn, chipotle and mullet bottarga
Scallop, prickly pear leaf, elderflower and cardamom
Caviar pasta, garlic, evo oil, chili pepper and aged chocolate
Roses cake with vanilla ice-cream

Some beautiful bites, for sure the bonito, lobster, pork, pineapple/potato, tendon, bread, duck, scallop. 

The caviar pasta, which was essentially an aglio olio with cocoa on top, as the pre-dessert/penultimate course was absolutely tremendous. 

After a beautifully attentive service we shot the shit with chef and some of the staff out front for a while.
I thought things were beautiful. I really love the story these guys are telling and the compassion with which they do it. 100% worth *, could be ** but honestly rather them be * and keep being bold.

1p64dbl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p64dbl,"Ginza Shinohara (Tokyo, **, Tabelog Gold, Oct 2025)","My second visit to Ginza Shinohara but had dinner instead of lunch this trip. It was recently the chef's birthday in October and the restaurant was packed with a bunch of regulars who brought gifts. My friend whose a regular invited me and we were seated near the middle centre of the L shape counter so got a great view. I was the only foreigner and saw a few familiar faces from my previous visit and from my recent visit to Kitagawa. 

The hospitality provided by Shinohara and his team is still the outstanding, they were always quick to react to guests and would often check in on guests if they needed anything. The restaurant was lively as my previous visit but I got to interact more with the chef as my friend was frequently discussing dishes with the chef. It was one of the regular's birthday so he was provided with a complimentary bottle of champagne and a large birthday cake at the end. Another guest had a few dietary requirements so his had to be handled differently which didn't cause any problems during the dinner. 

The meal cost starts at 35,000 yen with a few addon options which was another 15,000. As we sat down we were all offered a welcome drink of Gyokyuro tea and once everybody had arrived diner shortly began - 

1. Trio of crustaceans with trio of Chrysanthemum, Ise Lobster, Blue Crab & Hairy Crab served with vinegar jelly - favourite was the hairy crab but they were all good. 
2. Tai (sea bream), matsutake mushroom and egg tofu soup - the tai and matsutake pairing was delightful 
3. Anago hand roll with yuba egg and cucumber - nicely cooked anago
4. Hassun with ginko nuts, tofu with beans and shiitake, persimmon namasu, octopus with leaves, fig with sesame sauce, simmered abalone, enoki mushroom Shonai Fu with cheese, kombu cured scallops Sawara with daikon - symbolising mid autumn moon festival with its arrangement, the dishes are prepared to highlight the season's bountiful harvests - the hassun is always impressive at Shinohara, a lot of mini bites going on and we are given free reign in how to tackle the course. My favourites were the persimmon and enoki mushroom. 
5. Candied chestnut and sweet potatoes in syrup - nice balance of sweet and savoury 
6. Ayu Grilled with uruka soy sauce and its head fried separately - Great cook and the soy sauce helps to enhance the fish flavour.  
7. (Addon) Botan ebi in Shaoxing wine with uni - the Shaoxing wines aroma and shrimp's strong sweetness make it a very enjoyable dish
8. Monaka filled with Grilled foie gras, dried Persimmon &andwhiskey jelly  - a staple at Shinohara, unique combination which I enjoy every bite. 
9. two varieties of matsutake, one from Hida takayama and another from Yunnan china - slight textural differences but I preferred Miyagi's stronger flavour. Both variants are prepared simply but are packed full of flavour 
10. Fried Suppon (shoft shelled turtle) - the cooking method was tweaked since last I came and I felt it tasted juicier and flavourful than the first time. 
11. Uni & Yamagata dashi somen - delicate dashi flavour inspired from Yamagata region 
12. Hotpot of Wild boar meat in Ise lobster broth with green onion and mushroom - The broth has a rich umami flavour and the boar meat has soaked up these delicious juices making it one of my favourites of the evening. 
13. Masutake rice with layered pickles and an addon of Hida beef chateaubriand - my third portion of matsutake rice of the day, I don't think I can ever get tired of it. the beef is cooked perfectly and seasoned well. my friend was getting full so he opted to only have half portion. 
14. Autumn salmon and ikura rice porridge  - like the texture of ikura and rice, flavour was ok
15. Soybean coffee kuzu manju - chewy manju with coffee flavour was delicious
16. Matcha

Overall I enjoyed the meal more than the my first visit. I would attribute the seasonal ingredients being the main factor but it seemed like most of the regulars agreed todays course was one of their favourites. The meal wasn't life changing by any means, but was very enjoyable due to the service and price performance is still great.",6,1764048760.0,finedining,0,1.0,False

Many home brewers struggle with inconsistent shots, weak milk foam, or confusing equipment, so I will be building guides that are practical, technique-focused, and easy to follow for anyone looking to brew coffee specifically home brewers.

I’d love feedback on a few things:

* Which parts of home coffee brewing do you find most confusing or frustrating?
* What kind of content would you like to see more of — brewing guides, equipment reviews, troubleshooting tips, or something else?
* Do you think a dedicated resource like this adds real value for home coffee enthusiasts?

We were very close at the beginning which led to me becoming crazy and falling for him. People who were in his frat would ask him if I was his girlfriend because we spent so much time together. I never expressed those feelings though bc it’s never a question if a guy likes you if he likes you. Normal friendship stuff occurred with other girls that caused a shift in our friendship. I went from unplanned sleepovers on his couch to not even going to birthday dinners. At some point due to other people we distanced our selves the last year and half but remained friends on paper. We have both graduated and are back in our hometown. I know he doesn’t like me romantically bc our norm was him showing me hot girls who were messaging him and even showed interest in my roommate at some point back when we were in college. So, now we’re back and after a long time of distance we see eachother every other weekend getting food, coffee, and shopping. Plans are initiated by him and also include our friend from school who also lives in the same town. Don’t get me wrong, I love hanging out and being friends with them. My only qualm is how he went so long picking our other friends over me but now that we’re back in our city it’s like the past year didn’t happen. I care a lot about him and our friendship but I think because a little part of me will always like him a little bit romantically I question everything when it comes to him. I can’t fathom a guy like him good looking, very smart, good job, and passionate casually wants my company. Especially when he has friends from high school always going out and a bunch of girls in his phone. In a nutshell I can’t pinpoint why he chooses to spend time with me when he so simply ignored me a couple months ago. I think he is the coolest guy good fashion sense great music that I get from him that impresses other men when I meet them. So maybe he’s actually a bad person who likes my attention.

“I’m sorry, there's nothing I can do for you, the War’s over”, replied the Colonel.

“Wait, hold on just a minute, I didn't come all the way here just to pack it in and go home, give me something god-damnit”.

Colonel Stutz tensed his face, and shot me a look that’d pin a rottweiler’s tail between its legs.

“How about you stand at attention lieutenant…” he searched my eyes in hopes he could find my name. I was almost too hesitant to respond.

“...Morning. I-it’s Lieutenant Morning” I managed to screech out.

“Well anyways Lieutenant, I dont got nothing for ya. Our goal right now is to get our asses back home before our wives find a new husband. You should be fucking happy you’re not face up in the mud right now.”

My heart broke. I’m the only Lieutenant in my regiment who hasn’t seen combat. I'm the fool of an officer who showed up to the greatest war this world has ever seen a week after it ended. I should have enlisted and shipped out as soon as the Americans got involved, but instead I stayed at west point.

My eyes began to drag across my face, my fists clenched to the sides of my leg, I was holding back every emotion I had behind my sullen sorry face.

Colonel Stutz eyed me, lowering his temper like a tea pot being taken off the stove.

“Look, I get you want to be involved, but there is no more fighting. We showed up 5 months ago and kaiser tucked his tail and surrendered. We’re all ready to put the great war behind us.”

“Sir you stamped your name in the history books, Let me stamp mine, Everyone in this regiment has been fighting since day 1 of the American campaign, let me help clean it up at the very least. I know we’re heading home but if you could reassign me to a unit that is staying here. I heard a rumor from some of the enlisted that General Pershing wants men for his American Expeditionary Forces, I just want to be able to go home having accomplished something…anything.” I wasn’t sure if I was allowed to talk but the words slipped past my lips.

Colonel Stutz breathed an exasperated sigh, I could tell he felt sorry for me, “I don’t know what you hope to accomplish, but I’ll reassign you to AEF. Grab your bags and speak with CPT mann up at HQ, Hopefully they decide to send you home”

“Thank you sir”

I picked up my bags and left Col Stutz’s offices. Walking out onto a primitive road in the meuse argonne forest I smelled this putrid scent, coming from the east. Even the bloated dead cows in the field back home in Colorado didn't give off this stench. It smelled like sulfur imbued with notes of rotten acorns. Waves of trucks and Mark IV tanks passed by, with soldiers hunched over in the back. They were heading west. I paused for a moment and wondered if I had made a mistake of not following them. Unwittingly my legs moved east towards 1st army HQ.

The smell grew stronger now, the putrid stench of corpses and chemical weapons blighted the fields. I walked along the tree-line careful to not get caught on any barbed wire, passing bodies stacked chest high. They were smoldering, their uniforms melted into their skin until I couldn't tell where their clothes started and their bodies began. “Jesus” I exclaimed as I began to feel my stomach retch. At that moment I saw a white dove a couple yards in front of me pecking and pulling at a hunk of flesh that looked like rotted minced meat.

I arrived at HQ and after asking around for directions, I found myself at CPT Mann’s tent unsure if the proper protocol was to knock. I mean I can’t really knock right? It's a canvas tent. I opted to smack the flap and blurted out “Lieutenant Morning here to report to CPT Mann” from inside the faded tent I heard “enter”.

Walking inside there was a wooden cot, a small work tool chest with papers strewn all over it, and a slated crate, upon which CPT Mann sat with a type writer. “DING!”, the type writer sounded off, which queued Captain Mann to look up at me.

I tried to stand at attention but my head craned sideways on the roof of the tent, I hunched back over. “Sir, I am to be reassigned to the AEF, I’ve come to report”

“Ah, well….orders for the contingent to occupy Westphalia have already been assigned. To update that manning roster with another officer would require me to resubmit to the general and I’d rather not, It’d be easier for me to actually put you under an attache”.

“Well sir I’d actually like to go with the AEF to westphalia, you see i just got here and was hoping to…”

He wasn't listening, he pressed a new piece of paper into the rollers of the typewriter. The machine clacked faster than the ink could dry. Before I could attempt to regain his attention he pushed the carriage home, rolled out the new orders, and shoved it into my hands.

“Hermannstadt? Wallachia? What the fuck?” I scrunched my eyes and craned my neck forward at my new assignment. I was sure what I was reading must have been a mistake. Inquisitively I asked “Why on earth would they want to send an American to the Carpathians?”

“Well, as you know the great wars have grown and shrunk borders.The kingdom of Transylvania is already accustomed to this crap.” he starts to wipe off his desk of crumbs only occasionally looking back at me to see im still somewhat paying attention. “Look Hal im not gonna bore you with the history. Just know the days of kings are over, if you ask me that's what this whole war was about. Your job is to make sure that the town of Hermannstadt safely goes into the hands of the Romanians, a job that's easier said than done.”

To be honest I hadn't considered what this war was about, I'm not here for a purpose I suppose, I just didn't want to be the only one without a story to tell of the great war. I wondered for a moment what my role was, if I really am needed. “The armistice is signed, why would this job be easier said than done?”

He starts digging into his footlocker, frantically looking for something. I try to pry around his shoulder to see what paper he could possibly produce to explain why this job is going to be more difficult than I had initially thought.

“Ah! Here it is!” as he pulls out a tin of tuna. He pierces the tin with his knife and sucks the juice from the lid. “Mm” he mutters as he starts sucking his lips, the tuna dripping over his half shaven gritty face. He once again raises his knife to the lid and pries it open in the most unorganized way. All I could think was that my future was in this man's hand.

“Well.. As I had said there are many claims to that god forsaken land, The austrians, hungarians, romanians, and most importantly the saxons.”

“The saxons?” I said, “Like anglo-saxons?”

“No, Transylvanian saxons, they settled the lands in the cities and marshes, knowing they could farm the lands those gypsies couldn't. The Saxons are, as you could understand lieutenant, sympathetic to the Germans and their occupation of the carpathians”

Once again I found myself disappointed by the strings fate has woven me. Relegation to side projects seemed beneath my constitution. I grasped my orders and looked up in understanding of my task, I knew there was no point in arguing this time.

CPT Mann looked up at me, “I understand this is disappointing for you. But you and I find ourselves in a similar situation. I have spent this war hunkered over my desk at the beck and call of administration. I will be joining you in the mission to the carpathians. Hermannstadt will be the linchpin to the joint consolidation of Romania. And you are the sole custodian of its formation. I’ll be giving you a platoon, consisting of no more than 25 men”.

—“25 Men!? How do you expect me t-“

“25 men is more than sufficient for a PEACE keeping mission lieutenant morning, now as I was saying, we will begin our preparations and move out via a train. You and I will see to it that we make all necessary preparations for the upcoming journey and eventual success of this mission”.

The next week consisted of preparations. A wireless radio was given to my platoon, and with it a radio operator from the communications branch of the army. He would train me in the use and logistics of this system. I learned the basics of Morse code in order to communicate properly over the telegraph.

I also met with my assistant platoon leader, a sergeant by the name of Jack O’toole, when I arrived at the mess hall. He was a large man with a knotted and mangled Glasgow scar running across his left cheek. He had worn leathery pock marked skin, sand swept hair and light hazel eyes. A handsome fella in his own right with the rugged looks of a Coloradan outdoorsman. Upon my first sight he had a group of men surrounding him, preaching fieldcraft to his soldiers like a priest waxes poetically in sermon. His men were transfixed on every word as if a spell had been cast over them. A natural born leader, or a leader born from the battlefield, I have not yet surmised. Once he finished his sermon I pulled him aside.

We went over the plan for transit to Hermannstadt. He quietly absorbed every word of my direction via train routes. He was smart, intuitive, forthright in his words, and he understood my intent before the thought left my lips, ready to make the preparations needed. I could not have asked for a better platoon sergeant. I smiled at him, but he continued in his stoic expression. Possibly because of his Glasgow smile he never felt the need to smile from his lips.

Finally after a week of preparations we were ready to disembark for the carpathians, for the mission that awaited.

After 4 days of travel we arrived at the footsteps of Hermannstadt. I had gotten to know my platoon better in that time. O’Toole was a kind man who imparted his wisdom on anyone willing to hear it. I find myself bewildered at his stature, he could not be more than 21 years of age but still he commands a solemn and deep respect. With every sentence he flushes a parable from his experience either as a soldier or a field hand in Michigan. I can't help but feel like he was robbed of his youth by those who had appointed him to his position in the great war, and I oftentimes wondered what he would be like if he had stayed in Michigan to take care of his younger brothers.

I also had many conversations with my two squad leaders. Corporal Pike was a firm and loud mouthed brigand. If there ever were something to say you could be damned sure Pike would be the first to make his thoughts known. His preferred form of communication was harsh unabridged honesty laced with the horns of satyrism. If CPL Pike was an honest devil then CPL Bush was a stoic philosopher. We’re all certain CPL Bush grew up as a quaker due to the silent way he skulks between the formation whispering the movements of the day as the spirit beckons.

The train hisses to a halt and my platoon begins their tasks of unloading our gear. I walk across the platform and see a strange woman, with silhouetted black hair that laid curled across her collar bones like an upturned set of ram’s horns. Skin nearly translucent I could make out blue veins creeping along her chest under a soft complexion. She had powerful green eyes, rounded mouth, and upturned nose atop a face that looked like it belonged carved into stone in a gallery of fine arts. I stared for an inappropriate amount of time, too short to appreciate her beauty yet too long to remain respectful. She waved, beckoning me over.

“Good evening, Herr Morning, I am Lucia, the translator for you and company during your occupation of Hermanstaddt” Her voice was kind and inquisitive.

“Oh well we're not really here to occupy this country, It’s more like a post-conflict transfer of power I suppose” My voice kind of trembled off, as if my lungs ran out of air deeming the rest of my sentence too dull to draw another breath.

“I can tell you’re quick with the tongue. Politics should be easy for you.” Even as she cuts me with an insult the words do not sound calloused. Her thick vaguely eastern european/german accent was altogether too charming. “Not to worry, I’ll be doing the most of the talking and I’ll make sure you sound…presentable.”

“Yes well…While those words bring me some relief I’m sure we will be up to the challenge of diplomatic relations” a voice from the platform cut me off.

–”These GOD-DAMNED CARTS, a year man! We’ve been stacking bodies on these fucking carts for a year and they always break like this! With no replacements and no tools to fix them! Now were in bram stokers nightmare in the middle of winter fiddle fucking around with these damned things..” CPL Pike’s voice trails off in the distance as he runs to the other side of the platform.

She regarded me with the steady, unblinking patience of an owl studying a field mouse in the open. In that brief, wordless moment, we understood one another.

I hear shouting from CPT Mann behind me. “Lt Hal Morning!” He yells finally catching my attention away from Lucia. “We’re in the thick of it now aren't we? Listen. I’ll be headed off to the next stop in kruhnen. Settle your men near St. Michaels and get your telegraph set up, we’ll make contact tomorrow morning around 0900.”

We hug goodbye and begin stretching our legs to our makeshift headquarters to the south of the city. We round the corner of the pine curtain and see a prudent looking castle sitting atop a hill. There were no adornments, banners, or markings of any kind. Just a simple stone castle gleaming the city to the north.

“St. Michaels..” mutters Lucia. I lean in forward pressing my curiosity. “A church? Why would a church need to be fortified in such a way? It’s got walls, ramparts, slits”

“But you must know,” Lucia whispered. “This land and its souls have been contested for much longer than you can imagine.”

I replied, “Like the crusades? I read on my way over here that the ottoman empire did not reach this part of the carpathians until the 16th century, this castle looks much older, it looks positively medieval, 8th or 9th century at most”. Lucia stayed in her demeanor.

“You might know history, you might know buildings, but that does not mean you know this city”

–”Im sorry Lucia I just”

Lucia interrupted “I’m sure you see just a normal European city but I must warn you that we are used to strange faces telling us who owns these mountains. You are correct in that the church moved on these lands centuries ago, St. Michaels is like a rock bearing against waves of the ocean, slowly being eroded away.”

“So you are the waves?” I asked

“No Herr Morning.” Lucia side-eyed me from beneath the curtains of her hair, “we pay the price, the same as any church or invader.”

I did not dare continue this conversation, I fear I have made one too many waves in this conversation already. Though the curiosity of just what the hell she means by all that is gnawing at my tongue. I find myself replaying her words in my mind on our short approach up to the church, I look at the clouded moonswept mountains in the distance. As a coloradan I am plenty used to mountains but these ones are entirely different. They curl across the landscape like a great wreath surrounding the city. I begin to feel insignificant as their roots poetically drag my eyes across its many faces. We begin our preparations at the foot of the hill leading up to saint michaels.

I begin to give billeting orders to the men, making sure to give Private Halsin orders to set up the radio in my shack so I can receive contact at 9:00am sharp. I settle into bed, as the day's events race in my mind I finally drift off to sleep.

CLICK…..BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP…BEEEEEEEP. I begin to wake up, expecting light but only seeing the moon shine through the window. On the table in the front of the room I see the radio begin its transmission. Click BEEP BEEP click click BEEEEP. It sounds distorted like it's low on power. I try to get up to receive the transmission but I can't move. The beeps are getting longer, stretched across the wire burning itself into the frequency as my ears begin to resonate against the bouncing harmonics. I feel like a singing bowl being scraped past the point of fluidity. My eyeballs burn from the sensation.

From the corner of my room a face seemingly appears from the curtain of shadow. Its skin is porcelain, fitted onto its thin face like a geisha’s mask. It’s positively smooth with no pores, blemishes, or detail, like the first pass of an oiled painting. I rub my eyes to adjust my focus onto the figure. But my eyesight never fully returns, I look into the corner and just see a static grey. My tongue folds into my mouth and wriggles in the back of my throat like a fresh caught eel in a net. My body begins to feel shallow as fear slowly overcomes my still body.

I suddenly wake up, the day light pushes its way into my room, with no sign of the monster that was once there. I immediately slap my hands onto my inner thigh. Relieved that somehow I had managed to fight off this nightmare without pissing myself.

“Sweet Mary, mother of Joseph"". I crash back onto the firm mattress. Rubbing my hands across my face I feel a faint sense of moisture perspiring from my face. A nightmare to be sure but an extremely vivid one. Unfurling the sheets the chill from my fallow residence seeps into my bed. I inhale sharply as I press my feet upon the icy wooden floor of my shack.

Walking out onto the front steps, the air was stolen from my lungs and whisked off into the frigid morning air.

I wandered over to the camp my soldiers had begun to settle into, I'm always amazed at what soldiers can do with a barren patch of land in so little time. There was a fire blazing in the center of 8 large and medium sized tents. These tents have been dug into the field just outside the walls of saint michaels. The sides of the canvas had been fortified with logs and moss for insulation against the cold winter winds that howl through the night.

Inside the tents they managed to scrounge together carpets that laid flat against the dirt, stoves to keep the tents warm, and cots that were fashioned into bunk beds. I suspected that Sergeant O'toole had a hand in these plans, he is after-all the fieldcraft expert.

Stepping down into the carved out pit they all stood up. ""There's no need for that gentlemen, as you were"". One of the soldiers dragged a stool near me and asked, ""Are you joining us for breakfast sir?” I pulled the stool between my legs and mounted the cold ply wood close to the fire. ""I might as well, this smells better than the hard tack I got left over...where did you manage to get these eggs anyways?"" SGT O’Toole piped up “We bought them when we stopped in Vienna because” –

Suddenly the entire camp repeated the same phrase “Always stock up on supplies when you can!”

Sergeant O’toole rolled his eyes “Correct! I'm glad you’ve all been listening! You all should be glad we did because this town seems to be short on chickens. I'd guess it’s the wolves, they were making a hell of a noise last night.”

they went back to their earlier discussion. ""I'm telling you we need to move the camp SGT"" CPL Bush said. CPL Pike chortled while mixing his eggs. ""What? ya 'fraid a skeleton's gonna come up from the ground and pluck your pretty little eyes out?"". The gang began to stir with their opinions on the matter, timidly talking about the skeleton.

I had been completely lost so I figured I'd ask ""A skeleton you say? where'd you find it?"". CPL Pike between stabbing motions of his eggs pointed back to his tent with the handle of his fork. There lay a skull on top of his chest. ""I'm calling him PVT Hamlet, he's watchin’ my treasure"". SGT O'toole rose to the occasion and replied ""I'm shocked you call your shit stained undies treasure, I'm even more shocked you know Hamlet"". The camp roared with laughter, even I couldn't hold back a smile.

O'Toole looked up from his breakfast, confidently taking a swig of his coffee and began to speak again before any one else could seize the moment of conversation ""this is an old potter's field Pike, we have to be respectful"". CPL Pike visibly confused began to open his mouth, O'Toole once again interjected ""A potters field for anyone unaware is a mass burial site originating from the new testament. Somethin about priests buying a field with the 30 pieces of silver judas gave them before he committed suicide. These fields are more common than ya think.""

The mood sharply turned serious. the quaker CPL Bush looked down at his feet and muttered a bible verse. "" 'It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.' And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter's field, to be a burying place for strangers. For this the field was called Aceldama, that is, the field of blood, even to this day"". A sallow tint washed across the faces of all my soldiers. eyes began to well with water like a wine cup filled to the brim but not yet overflowing. I can tell these men are lost in the events of the war.

I've had the misfortune of seeing piles of bodies littering the fields of the forest, many of those soldiers are unrecognizable as humans let alone individuals. There will be no way for their deeds to be written down in the glory of the great war.

Their identities are completely ripped from the corpse they are now. In a way it's the most heroic death, many of them sacrificed themselves knowing their names would slip into a void of the eternal subconscious. I feel a pinch of shame for thinking like this, saddened I was not there in the battles these boys fought. I feel like I had somehow failed them, but I also wondered if I would have been amongst the nameless corpses.

""Alright boys lets get this camp moved"" the raspy groans bellowed back at O'Tooles command like children being told to wash before supper. I began to walk back to my shack in order to make first contact with CPT Mann.

The cold seized me the moment I stepped out of the warm pit, my boots crunching over the frozen earth as I made my way uphill toward my new shelter. My thoughts drifted, almost hypnotically, to the boys and everything they had endured. They were so accustomed to death that skeletons, guts, even shattered skulls drew laughter. Yet the instant the talk turned to graves, or the quiet weight of remembering the dead, the mirth drained from them. The contrast lingered with me, unsettling and unresolved.

By the time I surfaced from those thoughts, my feet were already brushing against the shack’s crooked doorstep.

My pocket watch was about to strike 9 so I choreographed a message to be sent out, practicing my hand strokes until I felt I got the timing right. The message would read ""We set camp at church, will talk with translator today""

I was dreadfully slow at this, I felt like I got a hang of it in Germany but compared to the pros I was barely even an amateur. I would let PVT Pint do this but I believe a commander should write his own messages, and I'm sure I'll get better....hopefully.

My pen and paper were at the ready to transcribe the incoming message which shortly followed ""I Will come meet you on sunday, good luck."" With my first official report via radio handled I went about the business of doing my own version of setting up camp before Lucia arrived.

I cleared out the cobwebs, tidied up my chest, and began to sweep out the stove. The stove pipe was too clogged for a fire last night, if i had attempted to use it the ashes and soot would have clouded this whole room in a fine black powder. I should have gotten to work on this before I fell asleep since the room was deadly cold last night.

I was fastly running out of time, Lucia would be here any moment and I still needed to chop wood for the night. I looked around and saw the place was still a bit of a stye, in the back of my head i couldn't help but to be embarrassed if Lucia saw my shack in this state.

Time had run out though, I heard Lucia calling from the circular stone walls that surrounded my Head Quarters.

Lucia was wearing something more traditional for Romania today, a blouse with a sort of intricately patterned apron around a long skirt that baffled past her knees, a large woolen padded coat, and a cotton hood around her black hair that highlighted her bright green eyes and soft features. She was absolutely stunning. I wanted to compliment her but I couldn't, it wouldn't be right to compliment a lady who works for me, no matter how stunning she is.

""Good morning Herr morning"" a joke i had heard a thousand times back home especially at school from the other kids. In this instance it took on a different tone, she was teasing me, and god help me I liked it.

""ha...ha"" I replied, looking her dead in the face. I didn't have a comeback, I'm not as experienced in teasing as SGT O'Toole, maybe i should ask him to teach me how.

I spoke again, ""I figured we start in hermannstadt today"" Lucia nodded in agreement. I grabbed my holster for the Colt 1911 and my woolen jacket I strode out into the yard and onto the horse CPT Mann left me.

As soon as I reached out to Lucia to pull her onto the horse she swatted away my hand and hopped up behind the saddle. I didn't say anything as she wrapped her arms around my stomach and pressed her face into my back. The warmth was a new but strangely familiar feeling. As the horse began its slow trot to town CPL Pike and PVT Halsin noticed us riding in their direction. As soon as I passed them I could hear whistling, hootin, and all manner of hollering. God those boys piss me off sometimes but I can't help but to love them. They won't love me so much when I come back and let 'em know they just volunteered themselves for latrine duties.

The road winded into town, the buildings grew denser, the streets began to fill with people going about their business. Lucia and I were deep in conversation, she wanted to know all about life back home. ""It's terribly boring. I promise you, my dad and mom owned a number of businesses in town. They moved to CO a few years before I was born in order to take advantage of all the wealth from the mining industry. The wealth eventually found them and I grew up in a big house with 6 older brothers"".

Lucia wriggled in the back. ""My lord, the Mornings have a big family, I can't imagine what it's like to grow up with 6 older brothers, It must have been wonderful"".

""That's not the half of it. My father also had 6 older brothers and one younger sister. I guess its a curse of the family to have 7 sons until you get a daughter. My mom was worn out by the time I came along though"". Lucia jerked in the back, her head separated from my shoulders and I could feel her staring through me. ""seventh child of a seventh child, this explains a lot about you"".

""like what? that I'm cursed with younger brother syndrome"". The horse beckoned towards the city center.

""No Herr Morning, in Dacia this is an omen, you are meant to have a meaningful life, whether this is a curse or a blessing is up to you"" She pointed to the big church in the plaza ""this will be our first stop"" the horse began to veer towards the building almost by instinct. We stopped near the doors to the church and I swung my leg over the front leaping on to the cobblestones. As I went to grab the reins, Lucia pulled my body close to her, and pushed off my shoulders to ease herself down onto the ground.

""I thought you didn't want help on or off the horse"". Lucia fixed her hair and patted down her skirt, ""pfft if i want help I'll make it clear i want help, I'm not Cinderella and you are not prince charming, the only one of us that resembles a fairy tale is your noble steed"" She patted the face of the horse, smiling into his big eyes. ""He is quite a good horse isn't he? I've been wrestling with what to call him"".

Lucia began to walk towards the big oak doors of the cathedral while I was still yammering on ""maybe chestnut? it matches his fur."" Lucia let out a groan, ""too predictable"". I thought for a moment and quickly replied, ""Bullseye, that's a proper name for a horse where I'm from"" she just shaked her head. ""Lucia is a good name"", she stopped in her tracks and fear crept up my spine. I didn't mean any harm by it. I was just trying my hand at teasing but it's too late now. She turned back at me ""oh so you want to ride me huh?"" she grasped her hips and beckoned them.

I began to stammer like a half wit desperately clawing back my words when she yelped and smacked her ass laughing incredulously at me. ""torturing you is easy, it takes the fun out of it"". She composed herself as she walked into the church.

We entered the precipice of the cathedral, a glamorous white stoned structure with gold trimmings adorning the artifices. The pews lined the great hall filtering the pillars that rose gently towards the pulpit. To the side was a shallow enclave with red candles facing a great stone sarcophagus, with a priest praying before it. The hobnails on my boots clanked against the granite beneath my feet as I paced towards the priest with Lucia to my side. We pensively waited for him for a moment before he signed the cross, finishing his prayer.

“Apologies, I seem to have lost track of time” He broke the silence with a thick brogueish accent. I was never a devoutly religious man, at this point I scarcely imagine I could even call myself a believer. “Prayers always seemed to be a bit one sided for me father” I replied half heartedly, mostly because I wanted to make it clear I was here on business not for conversion.

“Ah! A non-believer I see!” he said almost gleefully “It’s quite alright my boy, you are correct, the conversations most of us have with god are indeed one sided”. He was a tall man, nearly my height, but he was thin, almost delicate looking. He had brown and grey haired sideburns wrapping all the way to his chin.

“That’s what I love about god my dear boy. His silence is what makes him god is it not?” I shot him an inquisitive look, He smiled at me, moving tapestries from one end of the church to the other, finally replying “oh please, I’m realistic as well as an idealist. God is one of the few influences in our lives who never requires a price for his love. You are given his salvation from the very moment you sprout your little wings and fly from your mothers womb. None of this is for him, it's for you and all other living beings to give a peaceful place to receive his grace. Nothing more, nothing less, you are as welcome here as any Pope”

He gestures silently to the cathedral that I must admit is quite serene. “I suppose I don't meet many of your type, most of the religious folks I’ve met in Colorado have been god-fearin’. They would pounce at the opportunity to judge passerbys from high atop their milk crates on a crowded sidewalk downtown”.

He finally moved the last tapestry and sat on the pew ushering us to sit beside him. “I have had the misfortune of meeting many like that myself, even from my own congregation. I don't believe God favors those who preach in such a manner.”

I paused for a moment peering at the cross behind him. Jesus slouched against the nails driven into his hands with blood trickling from the wound left by a spear.

He looked behind me “It’s an interesting sigil for Christianity isn't it? Our savior being betrayed, tortured, and murdered. His fearful expression scared me as a boy I admit. The bones of the saints and the holy sacraments seemed positively medieval to me. For a long time I believed these were just shocking images used by the church as a bit of an advertisement""

He said advertisement weird. Ad-vert-is-ment. British people sure have a funny way of talking, he continued into his sermon. “It wasn't until I had already taken my vows that it had dawned on me. It represents the sacrifice, a promise God made to the people of the world paid by the blood of his only son. We choose it as a reliquary to never forget our place in that contract. Though i think the meaning has been lost over the 2 millenniums”.

“You said you don't like people on the milk crates spreading the word of god, forgive me but is that not dissimilar to the catholic church?”. The priest chuckled “I appreciate your candidness Left-tenant morning. You are absolutely correct in some cases. The men who choose to use god’s name to further their own ideas of morality and status are taking the lord's name in vain, that is, using the name of god for your own vanity in hopes to elevate yourself, not the lord”. I’d been taken aback, not just by the silly way he pronounced lieutenant, but also by the fact he knew my rank and title. “Your father, how did you know who I was?”

“You are here to shepherd this town through a tumultuous time in its history, your name has become known to me because I am known to the people”. I had looked at Lucia who had been quiet all this time and she simply shrugged back at me. Lucia peered from over my lap and took the opportunity to get the conversation back on track, hoping to save me from salvation no doubt. “Father Simon, speaking of the people” she said in almost a whisper. “My little white dove here would like to know how he can help rebuild this city under new Romanian leadership”.

Father Simon straightened his stole around his shoulders. Pulling himself together as a representative of the church. “Ah, pardon me Lucia for straying off topic. Hermannstadt is facing a number of concerns, and we have far too few resources to address them after sending a quarter of our young men off to war”.

He pushed himself off the mahogany pew and shuffled to the pulpit grabbing a piece of paper and a pair of crescent moon shaped glasses. “Food for the winter is our main worry, we had to give up most of our stores for the war effort. There has also been some growing violence amongst the Saxons returning home from the war, particularly against those who deserted or did not wish to fight”.

Lucia began to discuss the town's logistical needs with father Simon, making a short list of supplies we’d need to request from the newly appointed Romanian government. I wasn’t sure yet how responsive the new government would be to supplying the city, or even if they could. Politics in any country, especially a new one, could be incredibly hard to navigate. I’d need Lucia’s help drafting a memo that I could send through my chain of command. In the meantime I’ll see if we can scrounge any extra classes of supply from the US army’s logistics branch.

As for the tension between the saxon’s and the deserters I will have to put it on the back burner. I wish I could do something but I can’t just punish people for their feelings. Though I steadied myself for the real possibility we will need to play sheriff in order to keep the peace.

Once we had finished with the work we came for, Father Simon gained our attention once more “I'm sorry Lucia but I thought you’d ought to know in case you feel you can be of any help, one of my Parishioners, Mrs. Coman, has a worrying case of a missing child. Her 10 year old son left one morning and never returned”.

Lucia nodded. “Herr Morning, I believe this would be a good task for you and your men, finding a child of Hermannstadt may help you gain the trust of its people. Besides, I'm sure Constantin has just wandered off, as he does from time to time.”

She was right. I am an outsider here and I know the people of Hermannstadt rightfully associate myself and my men with the war that took so much from them. I nodded, and said my goodbyes to Father Simon.",2,1764048132.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1p644eo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalMarketingHelp/comments/1p644eo/what_finally_helped_me_grow_after_daily_posting/,What finally helped me grow after daily posting failed,"I burned myself out early in my creator journey. I kept hearing *“post every day,”* so I did… and all it did was drain me out. The problem wasn’t consistency. The problem was I had literally no system, just pressure of posting daily...

Once I switched to batching, everything GOT SO EASY. My brain finally had room to breathe, and growth became so much predictable.

Here’s the exact process I use to turn one weekend into a full month of content without feeling like my entire life revolves around filming!!

**STEP 1: STACK YOUR RAW CLIPS**  
Stop filming “posts.” Start filming themes. Treat every clip like a puzzle piece you can reuse later.  
I shoot simple stuff: setting up my camera, talking to a friend, grabbing coffee, journaling, walking around, typing, working quietly, sunlight shots, transitions, my tools.  
It all becomes reusable B-roll and storytelling footage.

**STEP 2: RECORD FOR REPURPOSING**  
Creators waste so much time hunting for the “perfect shot.” Instead, I capture motion, mood, and multiple angles so one moment can turn into ten different edits.  
I’ll film the same topic in two moods (motivational vs relatable), or shoot the same routine and narrate it with different lessons later.  
This is how pros get more out of less.

**STEP 3: WIN THE FIRST 3 SECONDS**  
If the hook fails, nothing else matters.  
These are the ones that consistently perform for me:  
• “Here’s what I wish I learned sooner about \_\_\_.”  
• “Nobody told me this when I started \_\_\_.”  
• “You’re probably making this mistake…”  
• “Watch this before you quit \_\_\_.”  
• “This simple shift changed everything for me.”  
They aren’t clickbait yk, they’re curiosity openers. *(wink ;)*

**STEP 4: BUILD CONTENT CHAINS**  
People think every post has to be a masterpiece. Nopes.  
Your content should like FEED itself.

Think of it like this:  
• 1 story + 1 lesson + 1 how-to = 3 reels  
• 1 trend + 1 reaction + 1 tip = 3 reels  
• 1 carousel + 1 reel + 1 story = 1 mini-campaign

By doing this, i managed to turn 1 weekend suddenly turns into a month of consistency.

**STEP 5: DESIGN A CREATOR DAY**  
Don’t *“find time.”* Block it.

I mean:  
Morning: shoot all B-roll  
Afternoon: script & film  
Night: edit or caption  
Next day: schedule everything, then rest

Discipline isn’t about being chained to your phone. It’s about protecting your creative bursts instead of killing them with daily pressure.

You don’t need to post more.

I burned myself out early in my creator journey. I kept hearing *“post every day,”* so I did… and all it did was drain me out. The problem wasn’t consistency. The problem was I had literally no system, just pressure of posting daily...

Once I switched to batching, everything GOT SO EASY. My brain finally had room to breathe, and growth became so much predictable.

Here’s the exact process I use to turn one weekend into a full month of content without feeling like my entire life revolves around filming!!

**STEP 1: STACK YOUR RAW CLIPS**  
Stop filming “posts.” Start filming themes. Treat every clip like a puzzle piece you can reuse later.  
I shoot simple stuff: setting up my camera, talking to a friend, grabbing coffee, journaling, walking around, typing, working quietly, sunlight shots, transitions, my tools.  
It all becomes reusable B-roll and storytelling footage.

**STEP 2: RECORD FOR REPURPOSING**  
Creators waste so much time hunting for the “perfect shot.” Instead, I capture motion, mood, and multiple angles so one moment can turn into ten different edits.  
I’ll film the same topic in two moods (motivational vs relatable), or shoot the same routine and narrate it with different lessons later.  
This is how pros get more out of less.

**STEP 3: WIN THE FIRST 3 SECONDS**  
If the hook fails, nothing else matters.  
These are the ones that consistently perform for me:  
• “Here’s what I wish I learned sooner about \_\_\_.”  
• “Nobody told me this when I started \_\_\_.”  
• “You’re probably making this mistake…”  
• “Watch this before you quit \_\_\_.”  
• “This simple shift changed everything for me.”  
They aren’t clickbait yk, they’re curiosity openers. *(wink ;)*

**STEP 4: BUILD CONTENT CHAINS**  
People think every post has to be a masterpiece. Nopes.  
Your content should like FEED itself.

Think of it like this:  
• 1 story + 1 lesson + 1 how-to = 3 reels  
• 1 trend + 1 reaction + 1 tip = 3 reels  
• 1 carousel + 1 reel + 1 story = 1 mini-campaign

By doing this, i managed to turn 1 weekend suddenly turns into a month of consistency.

**STEP 5: DESIGN A CREATOR DAY**  
Don’t *“find time.”* Block it.

I mean:  
Morning: shoot all B-roll  
Afternoon: script & film  
Night: edit or caption  
Next day: schedule everything, then rest

Discipline isn’t about being chained to your phone. It’s about protecting your creative bursts instead of killing them with daily pressure.

1p640uz,https://classautonomy.info/iww-iu640-restaurant-worker-manifesto/,IWW IU640 Restaurant Worker Manifesto,"[IU640 Members of SE Michigan](https://industrialworker.org/restaurant-worker-manifesto/) || The restaurant industry stands at the frontlines of a new labor movement. A [recent report](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/sites/default/files-d8/2025-03/labor_action_tracker_2024_final-rev.pdf) reveals that the highest concentration of strikes in recent years has come from the food service sector. From fast food counters to fine dining kitchens, workers are rising up. These struggles are not isolated incidents but signs of a broader transformation — a wave of unionism sweeping through the food service sector.

# Why Organize Restaurants?

Most restaurants are small shops, a structure that presents unique opportunities for dynamic and decentralized organizing. Within a framework of [solidarity unionism](https://organizing.work/2018/09/what-solidarity-unionism-also-isnt-a-reply-to-don-white/) — where workers take collective action independently of formal recognition or contracts — restaurant workers can take swift and effective action on their own terms.



The labor movement doesn’t just need a revival; it needs [more and better organizers](https://libcom.org/library/introduction-more-better-organizers). The food sector is rich soil for growing [new leaders](https://industrialworker.org/level-up/). Many workers enter food service at young ages and often transition to other industries over time, spreading the skills and experiences gained through organizing. This makes restaurants training grounds for a new generation of militant, thoughtful, and strategic unionists.

# Building a Diverse and Powerful Coalition

Restaurant work is disproportionately held by marginalized communities — immigrants, LGBTQ+ individuals, BIPOC workers, women, and others. This makes the food industry a vital terrain for building a multiracial, gender-inclusive, and intersectional labor movement. Organizing here can empower communities that have long borne the brunt of exploitation, exclusion, and precarity.

# Restaurants as Sites of Resistance

Restaurants have also become battlegrounds in the fight for immigrant rights. ICE raids target these workplaces more frequently than many other sectors, threatening workers and communities. Organizing in these spaces is a form of resistance against the criminalization of immigrants.

Moreover, airports — where food service workers are often employed — are [sites of deportation](https://www.wcax.com/2025/08/06/protesters-decry-ice-deportation-flights-burlington-airport/). Organizing airport food workers opens a strategic front in the struggle against immigrant deportation and state violence. Workers can use their power on the job to disrupt these operations and stand in solidarity with those targeted by the state.

# Restaurants as Revolutionary Social Spaces

Restaurants, cafes, pubs, and similar establishments are not just workplaces — they are social hubs where people come together to share meals, ideas, and experiences. These spaces play a vital role in the cultural and political fabric of our communities. When we organize these workplaces, we aren’t just building a revolutionary movement among workers; we are also claiming and transforming these spaces into centers of [social and political life](https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/mangrove-nine-arrested/).

By holding space for others to gather, converse, and organize, food service workers extend the reach of our movements beyond the shop floor. We turn everyday places into sites of resistance, mutual aid, and collective imagination.

Assh\*\*e Chef. By Jefferson Pierce.

# A History of Resistance

The food service industry has long been a flashpoint in broader social and political struggles. Historic job actions in restaurants have helped reshape society:

* [Sit-downs](https://www.chron.com/this-forgotten-day-in-houston/article/54-years-ago-Freedom-Riders-jailed-after-sit-in-6440082.php) at [segregated lunch counters ](https://www.wttw.com/timemachine/jack-spratt-coffee-shop-sit)during the Civil Rights Movement played a [pivotal role](http://www.kentucky.com/news/special-reports/article210149579.html) in dismantling racial segregation.
* The Stonewall Rebellion, often cited as a turning point in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights, [erupted at a pub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots) where workers and patrons resisted police violence.
* Hiring halls were used as a tool to desegregate waitstaff in Detroit restaurants.
* Boycotts and pickets were leveraged to desegregate workplaces and build equitable [employment systems](https://www.searchablemuseum.com/dont-buy-where-you-cant-work/).
* Restaurant workers have engaged in direct action by [refusing service to police officers ](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ohio-restaurant-closed-after-employees-refused-to-make-500-tacos-for-cops/)as a protest against police brutality.
* Workers have fought for and won the right to [express their religious beliefs](https://libcom.org/news/article.php/iww-starbucks-100206) on the job, asserting their dignity and autonomy in the workplace.

These examples show that food service jobs are not just sites of economic struggle — they are arenas for broader social transformation.

# Conclusion

The food service sector is not just ripe for organizing — it is essential. It holds the potential to revitalize the labor movement, diversify its leadership, and root it in communities that face intersecting oppressions. It is time for restaurant workers to take the lead in shaping a new era of labor power.

**Militant and democratic shopfloor committees are the building blocks for a new social and economic order. Organize with your co-workers. Link your struggle to others. And together, let’s lay the foundation for revolutionary industrial unions that can transform the food service industry — and society as a whole.**",3,1764047600.0,Waiters,0,1.0,False

I built **The Café Academy**, a platform designed to help home baristas make better coffee at home. I provide clear, step-by-step guides on espresso, milk steaming, bean selection, and equipment use, so that anyone can consistently brew coffee that tastes like it came from a café.

I created this because I want coffee drinkers to enjoy the **same great drink every time they brew**. Many home brewers struggle with inconsistent shots, weak milk foam, or confusing equipment, so I will be building guides that are practical, technique-focused, and easy to follow for anyone looking to brew coffee specifically home brewers.

I’d love feedback on a few things:

* Which parts of home coffee brewing do you find most confusing or frustrating?
* What kind of content would you like to see more of — brewing guides, equipment reviews, troubleshooting tips, or something else?
* Do you think a dedicated resource like this adds real value for home coffee enthusiasts?

Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated — I want to make this as useful as possible for the community!

* **Profile photos are live** — you can now upload your pic instead of using an URL
* **Availability got smarter** — cleaner schedule display, better formatting, and a more polished booking experience overall. It gets also automatically pulled out from Calcom if you link it.
* **Mobile experience improved** — especially on iOS where everything used to randomly zoom in like it wanted attention.
* **App got a glow-up** — refreshed backgrounds, tidier cards, better spacing, improved typography… basically the whole place looks less like a prototype and more like something you can proudly show students.

Still building everything with the same goal: give teachers a clean, trustworthy personal space to showcase their work and bring their own students — without fees, gimmicks, or platform lock-in.

I’m visiting China soon and decided to focus on the Jiangsu Zhejiang Shanghai region. I only have seven days, so I narrowed it down to Shanghai, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. I want the trip to feel relaxed instead of rushing through too many places, so here is my current plan.

Day 1 to Day 3: Shanghai

I will start in Shanghai and stay for three nights.

On the first day I want to walk around the Bund and take in the skyline at night. I’ll probably visit Yu Garden the next morning and then head to the French Concession in the afternoon for a slow walk and some coffee.

One of the days I plan to go up Shanghai Tower or Shanghai World Financial Center. I also want to try a few breakfast places and maybe check out some small museums or just wander around the side streets.

Day 4 to Day 5: Suzhou

On day four I will take the high speed train to Suzhou. The ride looks very short and easy.

I plan to visit the Humble Administrator’s Garden and walk along Pingjiang Road. I want to try some local snacks there as well.

The next morning I might visit another garden or take a boat ride on one of the canals. I will probably stay here for just one night before heading to Hangzhou.

Day 6 to Day 7: Hangzhou

I will end the trip in Hangzhou.

My main plan is to spend time around West Lake. I want to walk part of the lake and then visit Lingyin Temple.

If the weather is nice, I might take a small boat on the lake or visit a tea village like Meijiawu for a couple of hours. In the evening I may go to Hefang Street for food and souvenirs.

I will fly out after my second night here.

Apps I prepared before the trip

Alipay — seems like the easiest way to pay for things.

Didi — in case I need a ride when I’m tired or carrying luggage.

RedteaGO — so I have data as soon as I land in Shanghai.

This is my current plan. If anyone familiar with these cities thinks I’m missing something important or has simple suggestions that can make the trip smoother, I would really appreciate your advice. Thanks in advance.

At first I was considering Timemore 064s and Lagom casa as they are ~$500 when on sale and I have read good reviews about both. However, I’m not sure if the grinders would be a much of an upgrade from my Specialita.

I kept looking and found the Mazzer Philos which is ~$1500 which includes both sets of burrs. I also saw the Lagom P80 is ~$1760. Both reputable and solid companies and grinder reviews from what I’ve read so far.

I love the aesthetic appeal of the P80 since it looks like something I would find in a science lab (think microscope). I saw the P64 a long time ago but was not ready to justify spending that much money on an entry level espresso grinder. The P80 wouldn’t require swapping out burrs between espresso and filter coffee which is a plus for me. If the Mazzer was still $1000 before the price hike earlier this year, I would probably be leaning much more heavily towards that.

If I got a p80 or another grinder, what machine recommendations would be a viable upgrade from the infuser? I am based in the USA.

Santa Clara government periodically publishes health inspection score and publish it at SCCDineOut website, but it is quite clunky when you want to search near you, for example.

REGARDING JANE — Chapter 6:
The Morning After


Jane woke at 10:12.
For a moment she thought the number was accusing her—too late, too soft, too much of a surrender—but the feeling dissolved when her phone lit up like a misfired distress beacon on her bedside table.
Seven missed calls from Rami.
 Two texts.
 One reply from Dad (timestamped 2:19 a.m. New Mexico time).
 One missed call from Mum.
 And someone knocking on her door.
A gentle knock.
 More suggestion than demand.
“Jane? Just… checking in.”
Claude. With coffee, obviously.
She pushed her hair off her face, did the bare minimum to resemble a functioning organism, and cracked open the door.
Claude stood in a soft jumper, holding a takeaway cup in both hands like he was carrying a bird he didn’t want to startle. His expression was open, patient—worried only in the way people get when they genuinely like you and don’t have an agenda.
She stepped aside. Let him in.
He sat at her little table by the single-pane window that overlooked Walm Lane, and she curled around the coffee at the edge of the bed. The studio was still today—no shifting furniture, no humming corners, no cryptic commentary.
Just a room.
 Mercifully just a room.
When she finally spoke, she offered him only what she could articulate: the fog, the overwhelm, the sense of slipping sideways from herself. Not the drawer. Not the seven-point sun. Not the way the world had tilted and then politely reset.
Claude listened with his whole body.
 No prying.
 No suggestions.
 Just present.
“At least,” he murmured, “you’re here.”
When she ducked into the bathroom to get dressed, Claude’s attention drifted. His eyes lingered a second too long on the drawer—the one that sometimes shifted half an inch to remind her she wasn’t imagining things. His brow furrowed. Not recognition. Not fear. Something adjacent.
By the time she came back out, boots in hand, Claude was already standing.
“Fresh air?” he asked softly.
She nodded.
—
The walk down Walm Lane was quiet, softened by late-morning slush and the low hum of the A5 filtering through the cold. Buses groaned like old gods; someone scraped ice off a windscreen using what looked suspiciously like an Oyster card.
Jane breathed in air that smelled like wet brick, diesel, and yesterday’s newsprint.
Exactly what she needed.
As they approached Chichele Road, she spotted Rami through the deli window, stacking pastries with theatrical focus—the kind of focus that meant I’m pretending not to worry about you.
She lifted a hand.
 A small wave.
 An apology without words.
Rami startled, met her eyes, and relief softened every part of his face. He mouthed: Later.
 She nodded: Not yet.
She didn’t go inside.
Instead, she slipped into the tiny pharmacy next door—the one with the flickering green cross that never blinked the same pattern twice. Claude waited outside, hands tucked in his pockets, watching the street.
Inside, fluorescent lights hummed with the resigned energy of pharmacies everywhere. Shelves offered the standard necessities of mortal life: toothpaste, plasters, shampoo, dry shampoo, deodorant, ibuprofen.
She grabbed what she needed—lavender shampoo, cotton rounds, toothpaste.
Then she paused in the children’s aisle.
A purple bottle of cold syrup sat on the shelf, its cartoon moon wearing a nightcap.
The moon blinked.
A slow, companionable blink.
 As if to say, You’re alright, love. Keep going.
Jane blinked back.
The moon’s smile widened by a barely perceptible degree.
 Reassuring.
 Ridiculous.
 Perfect.
She placed the bottle in her basket with reverence normally reserved for holy objects.
By the time she turned away, the label was perfectly still again.
She didn’t look back.
Claude saw her emerge, read the shift in her posture, and didn’t ask. He didn’t need to.
—
They walked back up Walm Lane at a soft pace. No glitches in the air, no reality bending at the edges—just London doing its November thing: cold, grey, a bit damp, but steady.
Movement itself acted like medicine.
Claude matched her step for step. At one point she felt her posture shift—shoulders lowering, jaw unclenching—and Claude gave her the smallest, quietest nod.
Recognition.
 Not reward.
 Just: I see you.
It was enough.
When they reached her building, he lingered just long enough to confirm she wasn’t going to dissolve again.
She offered him a tiny, tired half-smile.
“Thanks,” she murmured.
“Any time,” he answered, and meant every syllable.
She slipped inside. Locked the door. Set the pharmacy bag on the counter. The studio held its breath—still, ordinary, a room waiting for her to come back into herself.
Jane pressed her forehead to the wall and exhaled a long, honest breath. The kind that doesn’t fix anything, but makes fixing possible later.
It wasn’t a good day.
 Not a catastrophic one either.
 Just… shitty and survivable.
Sometimes that’s all the universe offers.
 Sometimes that’s all she can ask of it.
She stripped off her clothes and stepped toward the shower.
Tomorrow could try again.

1p63evi,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1p63evi/my45_two_older_sisters_5561_are_excluding_my/,My(45) two older sisters (55&61) are excluding my family,"I’m a 45-year-old single mom with a 12-year-old daughter and a 16-year-old son. I have two older sisters, 55 and 61. We’re half-siblings (same mom), but we grew up close. Our mom passed almost 30 years ago, and my oldest sister even took me in when I was 16. I’ve had a rocky adulthood—on and off living with her—especially during my divorce. I definitely overstayed my welcome back then, but I’m fully independent now and doing well. I became a nurse, moved into clinical research, and have built a stable life for my kids.

Both of my sisters are very financially successful. One has been CEO of multiple startups and the other is a global head at her company. They easily make triple my income. They’re also empty nesters now, which I know plays into their lifestyle.

Here’s the issue:
They have started planning and taking family trips—Mallorca, Thanksgiving in Italy, etc.—and I’m just… not invited. These trips are way outside my budget, but they aren’t even mentioned to me until after the fact. When my middle sister visits (she comes to town to see her adult daughter), she’ll go out constantly with my oldest sister—fancy restaurants, wine, etc.—and my kids and I are never included. I can’t always afford these places, but even when I could meet up, we’re just not asked. Meanwhile, my kids see the Instagram posts and ask why they never get invited to see their cousins.

It makes me feel terrible. I’m not asking them to bankroll anything. Even a picnic, a coffee, a visit to a park—something that includes my kids—would go a long way. Instead, it looks like they only want to spend time with each other and exclude us completely.

On top of that, my middle sister recently reinvented herself as a “fashion/skin-care influencer for empty nesters.” I cringe through her videos, but I still watch them to help her views. None of it resonates with me—I’m not an empty nester, we have different bodies, and my skin is ten years younger than hers. She says she doesn’t feel “supported” by me, even though I’m watching all her content behind the scenes.

What really pushed me over the edge is that now my kids are asking why we’re always left out. They want to see their cousins, and I have no explanation that doesn’t make my sisters look cruel. So I finally sent a group message telling them this exclusion is hurtful and that it’s unacceptable—especially now that the kids are aware of it.

I genuinely don’t know if I’m missing something, if they’ve quietly written me off, if it’s a money thing, an age-phase thing, or something else entirely.

Is this normal sibling drifting, or is this straight-up exclusion? And was I wrong to call it out?",3,1764045651.0,FamilyIssues,3,0.81,False
1p63ev8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypersonaldevelopment/comments/1p63ev8/learn_to_be_grateful_in_difficult_moments/,Learn to Be Grateful in Difficult Moments,"In life, we often find ourselves navigating through challenging circumstances. Whether it's a personal setback, a professional hurdle, or unexpected life changes, difficulties are a universal experience. In these moments, practicing gratitude can be a powerful tool that transforms our perspective and supports our emotional well-being. Learning to be grateful, especially when times are tough, enables us to cultivate resilience and find beauty even amid hardship.

https://preview.redd.it/52jkufld1c3g1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b694e2c0687e99b4d024971ae6d4bdacbe3efd12



Gratitude is more than simply expressing thanks; it’s a profound way of looking at life that can redefine our experiences. By focusing on what we appreciate, even in difficult times, we shift our mindset from one of scarcity to abundance. This shift not only alleviates negativity but also brightens our outlook on life. When adversity strikes, it becomes essential to recognize the silver linings that still exist around us.



It may seem counterintuitive to be thankful during hard times, but this attitude can serve as a lifeline. When we consciously choose to appreciate the small things—like a warm cup of coffee, a good book, or even the simple act of breathing—we create a buffer against stress and anxiety. Gratitude encourages us to pause and reflect rather than react impulsively to our circumstances, allowing us to respond more thoughtfully.



The Power of Perspective



Gratitude fosters a change in perspective, a critical element when facing challenges. Instead of dwelling on what we lack or what’s going wrong, we begin to shift our focus towards what we still have. This can lead to greater satisfaction in life and a decrease in feelings of helplessness. Through this lens, we find ourselves embracing the present instead of obsessing over the past or worrying about the future.



Every challenge carries within it the seeds of opportunity. This perspective is where gratitude becomes particularly valuable. It allows us to redefine our experiences as chances for growth, self-discovery, and empowerment. By acknowledging our strengths and the lessons we learn from adversity, we cultivate a sense of purpose that propels us forward.



Building Resilience



Practicing gratitude introduces resilience, particularly in the face of hardship. When we regularly take stock of the positives, no matter how small, we build a reservoir of strength that we can draw upon during tough times. Resilient individuals are not those who experience no difficulties; rather, they are those who navigate challenges with a sense of hope and determination.



A key aspect of resilience is the ability to adapt and bounce back after setbacks. By fostering gratitude, we train our minds to seek out the silver linings that co-exist with difficulties. This resilience doesn’t mean ignoring our struggles; instead, it empowers us to acknowledge them while still choosing to appreciate other aspects of our lives.



Daily Gratitude Practices



Incorporating gratitude into your daily routine can greatly enhance your ability to remain positive during challenging times. Start simple: keep a gratitude journal where you write down three things each day for which you are thankful. They can be as simple as a compliment received, a moment of laughter, or the warmth of sunlight streaming through your window. This practice can create a habit of looking for the good.



Additionally, consider expressing gratitude to others more often. A simple ""thank you"" can brighten someone's day and foster connections, which is especially valuable during times of struggle. Sharing your appreciation not only uplifts others but also strengthens your own sense of community and belonging.



Mindfulness can also play a significant role in cultivating gratitude. By being present in the moment, you can appreciate the beauty around you—whether it’s the sound of rain, a child's laughter, or the aroma of your favorite meal cooking. Embracing mindfulness helps you pause and savor those fleeting moments, creating space for gratefulness in your heart.



Positive Affirmations



Using positive affirmations can further enhance your gratitude practice. Start each day with a statement that resonates with you, such as “I am grateful for the strength I possess” or “I embrace the lessons that my challenges teach me.” Reciting these affirmations fosters a positive mindset, encouraging you to carry gratitude with you throughout the day.



As you embark on this journey of learning to be grateful, remember that it’s a gradual process. There will be days when it feels challenging to appreciate anything, and that’s perfectly acceptable. The key is to keep returning to the practice, giving yourself grace and kindness along the way.



In conclusion, learning to be grateful in difficult moments is a journey of self-discovery and resilience. By consciously shifting our focus towards appreciation, we can transform our experience of challenges and foster a mindset that embraces possibility. Cultivating gratitude supports emotional well-being and encourages us to find joy in the present. No matter how tough the situation may seem, there is always something to be grateful for—allow this awareness to guide you.",1,1764045650.0,mypersonaldevelopment,0,1.0,False

**Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You Didn’t Sign Up For**  
Let’s cut through the chaos. The numbers scream louder than Ajax’s transfer budget during a sale. Benfica is the favorite here, with implied probabilities hovering around **52-53%** (thanks to decimal odds of \~1.91). Ajax? They’re priced at **25-27%**, which statistically means they’re about as likely to win this game as a vegan at a steakhouse. The draw? A meager **27-28%**, which is basically the sportsbook’s way of saying, “We’re not betting on a tie either.”

The spread lines are equally brutal. Benfica is -0.5 at most books, meaning they’re expected to win outright. If you back Ajax, you’re essentially betting they’ll lose by *less than a goal*—a bar so low it might as well be a free kick to the face.

**Team News: Injuries, Interim Managers, and José’s Midlife Crisis**  
Ajax is a cautionary tale. Since October 26, they’ve managed **zero wins** in eight games. Their manager resigned mid-season (apparently, John Heitinga’s exit strategy was “walk out the door”). Interim manager Fred Grim? He’s 63 years old and made his debut by losing to Excelsior—a team that sounds like a spreadsheet error. Oh, and Steven Berghuis is injured. That’s it. The rest of the squad? Healthy! Think of it as a one-man show… with a very sad audience.

Benfica, meanwhile, is José Mourinho’s latest experiment in futility. The “Special One” has four European losses in a row, which is about as special as a used coffee cup. Their attack is missing **Luuk de Jong’s teammate, Lukebakio**, who’s out for weeks after some mysterious injury (we assume it’s

He knew there was only one solution - to turn to the all-knowing oracle of modern dating: T̶i̶n̶d̶e̶r̶ Reddit lol.

With his trusty cup of sea salt coffee in hand, he set out to find someone who shared his thirst for knowledge, someone who could keep up with his quirks, and someone who he could eventually take on 'friendly' and ‘wholesome’ dates (whatever that means). He wasn't in a rush to jump into anything too serious too soon, but he knew that someday, he wanted to find someone he could build a meaningful and caring partnership.

So if you’re into third wave coffee, perpetual curiosity, and the full spectrum of nerdy pursuits, this particular vertical human might be worth your time. Dating really does feel like job hunting sometimes, doesn’t it? LOL! You either get guys who hasn’t moved on with their exes, who sends nsfw stuff right away or you get a friendly one so I figured why not lean into the absurdity and write this like a bloody resume. The joke entertained me, at least.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

##About me

An old soul as older people I spoke with would say, into small business and investments, 2nd year law student (took a LOA atm), can drive a fucking 10 wheeler truck lol (/s towards people looking for someone with wheels), no ex-cheating issues or sabit, can provide a certificate of no jowa (kahit wala naman talagang ganon haha). Last relationship (6 years) was 3 years ago and dated someone last year but didn’t worked out.

- I'm 5'9"", physically fit and active, resides in QC. I would say that average level attractive yet clean and very hygienic

- I'm an INTJ-T Arch, Aries, if you’re into MBTI and believes in that people only have 12 personalities.

- Loves to read history, finance and self-help books not because I’m smart rich but I believe about continous learning and motivate myself along the way.

-  I'm the kind of person who doesn't follow the herd blindly, even if it means standing alone in a field of conformity. My principles are like a compass, always pointing me in the right direction, even if it's not the most popular route. In short, I'm not afraid to swim against the current, as long as it's in line with my beliefs.

-  You could say that my communication style is like a triple-layered cake: serious, meaningful, and sprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. Sure, I may come off as really awkward at times, but that's just my way of keeping things interesting. After all, who wants a bland and flavorless conversation when you can have a deliciously complex one? So, if you're looking for someone who can engage in a thoughtful discussion, crack a few jokes, and still leave you with something to ponder, then look no further.

- I'm what you might call a clean freak with a creative streak. As someone who's a bit OC (okay, maybe more than a bit), I can't stand to see a messy or cluttered home. But don't worry, I'm not the type to wait around for someone else to do the dirty work. I take pride in noticing when something needs to be done and taking care of it without being asked - it's like a satisfying little victory every time. And when it comes to interior design and home decor, I'm practically a pro. I'm always on the hunt for the latest and greatest tools and gadgets to keep things looking fresh and stylish. So if you're looking for someone to spruce up your space and keep things sparkling clean, I'm your go-to guy.

- I'm not in the business of putting people down - unless we're talking about the volume on the stereo (badum-tss!). But seriously, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, even when it's not the easiest thing to do. After all, life is hard enough without having to deal with someone else's negativity. So let's lift each other up instead of tearing each other down, shall we?

- I set long-term feasible goals and actively pursue them.

##Pros:

- Respoņsible (Good credit score, no debts, no criminal records, and self-reliant)

- Curious type of person, who's ready to listen and craves to learn a lot of things

- Doesn't do drugs and is not a heavy drinker/alcoholic.

- Respects your views and accept healthy criticism. Respects personal space and time

- Actually appreciating the things you'll do for me, and showing it. If you cooked a big dinner, saying thank you is nice. Doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen is even nicer, and in my opinion, should be the norm. The cook doesn't clean. If someone does something for me, I'll show them that their effort was appreciated instead of just accepting their generosity and then running off back to whatever I'm doing.

- Accepts respònsibility or has accountability for one's own action and does not try to blame everything or everyone else. 

- No addiction/s, drugs, tattoos and not into online games

##My preference:

- Someone who has a strong passion for accurate and comprehensive learning, maintains a normal BMI, physically active and is beautiful and easy on the eyes - I believe that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes (no offense intended towards plus-size women!).

- High standards for what she wants and is not afraid to communicate it.

- Craves knowledge too. Love and isn't afraid to try new things

- Passionate and proud about something they've been working on/have done/are planning to do

- Confident about what they want but isn't in-your-face about it.

—and ideally, someone who enjoys staying active too, so we can share more than just deep conversations—maybe runs, hikes, or muay thai sessions together. Shared passions make connections even stronger.

Let's take a break from stressing over the mundane and focus on the important stuff - like what will make us happy for the rest of our lives! Share your thoughtys on how we can achieve that and let's get this happiness train moving! Send me your pic and I'll send mine to get started.

**Edit, 11/22/2025**

Posting again to try to find the right match. I’ve connected with some great people through here, but the timing or connection hasn’t always worked out.

I’m hoping to meet someone who stays active, has self-assurance, maintains a healthy weight, and lives substance-free. I’d also like to avoid situations where someone is still recovering from a recent relationship, as I’m beyond the age where I want to be a transitional person for someone.

It would be helpful if we could share pictures relatively soon to gauge whether there’s physical chemistry before spending a lot of time getting to know each other.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,1764045255.0,PhR4Dating,0,0.67,False

It was simple and it probably stung her that she couldn't give a more extravagant feast but she doesn't know that was my top 1 birthday celebration. The greatest 7th birthday ever.

But after a few years life slowly became comfortable for us. Cakes are getting bigger and so too does the guest list. The moment was being spread thin to more people until it became less meaningful to me.

I only saw my birthdays as an excuse to invite guests for the occasional gathering and chatter, until my 24th birthday. I still have that bday post from my mother with the tag and have to pass gratitudes to everyone who greets in the comments but that's easy to manage but tbh I hardly know these people, forcing myself to respond since not doing so people will rumor around how rude I am to my mother.

***-Early morning***

Mail finally came through. Susie worries too much, but I cherish every letter she sends me. Last week's been hell, Krauts are dug in deep. Our constant shellings have made sleep almost non-existent, not like were getting much anyway. 



France is dreary, the constant rain makes keeping the injured comfortable dicey. I pray it lets up soon.



**Sept. 10th** 

***-Dawn*** 

Morales high today. 



We managed to break their defensive lines and are making a push deeper. More Krauts throwing down their guns than I expected. Henry's family hails from the home country, apparently most prisoners we got are Czech. Heavy casualties on their side. Orders came down to save on resources.



***-Mid Day***

Command told us to ditch the S.I. helmets in favor of more discreet ones. SS Snipers have been taking potshots at crosses the closer we get to the village. 



Storm clouds are finally breaking, sun should follow soon.



**Sept. 12th**

***-Early Evening***

We took the village but it came at a cost. About 2 dozen injured and 5 missing as last call. The caught us off guard, fuckin buzzsaws cut through most of C Company. Had to mercy two of em, one kid couldn't have been older than 19. Kept asking for his father, telling me sorry when he saw he was getting blood on my shirt.



Henry managed to find a kraut stash, along with some schnapps. We got the bottle to most of the field medics, anything to keep the nerves at bay. 



***-Late Evening***

While clearing one of the ruined buildings we found some more stragglers. Shot them dead on the spot.



**Sept. 13th**

***-Break of Dawn***

Supplies finally came through. We actually got eggs with breakfast. Coffee tasted like shit but what could I expect? We’re only in France.



Krauts on full retreat, but rumors spread of a counter attack forming. Once we are finished with our duties, we will be made into a labor force. The sun is hot but it beats the constant wailing from the field hospital in the church. 



***-Early Evening***

I didn't realize how devastating our cannons had been. By the time dinner was called, we had two stacks of kraut bodies that were damn near head-height. One of the soldiers I found was holding a photo of a young woman, reminds me of Susie. 



Lord, I pray I get to see her again.



After we ate, Henry managed to find a couple more bottles off the dead. Despite his size, the boy can surely drink his schnapps. The number of losses are lower than expected, most of us are still in high spirits. Doesn't make the ones we lost any easier though. I just hope this confidence holds once the cold starts setting in.



Tomorrow tank divisions should be coming in from the rear to give us some much needed support. Who knows, at the rate we're going, maybe we'll be home by Christmas. 



***-Late Evening***

Sleep is a luxury these days. It seems the moment we get a hold of things in the church something else goes wrong. 



One man was seen trying to go back to the front, it took us 15 minutes to explain to him he was missing an arm and was going home. He just kept shouting how we were cowards, he felt fine he said.



That's the last thing we need, sick and injured men spooking the already fragile mental state of our boys. Most of them came during the first wave that hit Omaha. Looks like they aged 20 years in the past 2 months. 



**Sept. 14th**

***-Early Morning***

Still no sign of a counter attack. Patrols have been hitting small packs of resistance in the woods that border this once beautiful village. After what we've put it through, it looks closer to a shanty town now.



Carbine and machine gun fire can be heard throughout the morning. A small detachment got hit with some mortars, one man's legs were blown clean off his body. We found them a couple yards away, sticking out of the mud like some old slap stick comedy.



Henry found it hilarious. 



Cant scold him for finding some joy in this chaos, the sight was rather unusual. By the time lunch rolled around, we were back building up defenses. If the krauts were stupid enough to try and take this rock again, we were gonna give them hell.



***-Mid Day***

Tanks rolled in around 2, followed by beer trucks and some British paratroopers. We were tasked with assisting their medical staff as needed, the whole platoon looked like hammered shit.



Despite the look, Tommy's one tough S.O.B. 



On their way to us, they managed to liberate some whiskey. The way Henry was getting buddy buddy with the Brits, you'd almost expect his place to be by their side. I swear if the krauts paid their troops in alcohol instead of cigarettes, we'd lose Henry in an instant. 



**Sept. 15th**

***-Break of Dawn***

Woke up this morning to Pastor Louis reading the last rights of the dead krauts who didn't make it through the night. You'd be surprised how far French hospitality goes. 



Most of the civilians fled when we began our siege. A couple families stayed back, they took refuge in the church. To our luck, one of the men with us was the local doctor. With the way he's been helping, I'd expect Uncle Sam to start giving him a paycheck.



I offered our host some cigarettes as a thank you for letting us commandeer his temple. For a man of faith, he smokes like a chimney. In exchange for the tobacco, he let me into his personal stash of coffee he's kept hidden. 



Not too long into our breakfast, Henry woke up and joined us, still groggy from yesterday's festivities. 



I told him he smelled like a whore house, getting a chuckle out of the pastor. I wish some of the old kooks back home had the same sense of humor as Louis here. 



Henry told us that Tommy reported seeing signs of a wolf pack being active in the area. Dugouts of dead krauts looked like they had been picked clean. 



Louis looked troubled at this, told us no wolves had been in the area for years. I explained to him they most likely were displaced during our artillery barrages. He mumbled something under his breath before returning to his morning routine. 



Henry and I both just chalked it up to nerves. He keeps to himself mostly, I think that's why we work so well together. God only knows the horrors he's had to endure since the start of this god awful war. 



***-Mid Day***

Recon discovered a small armored convoy just north of our position, they're sending the shermans out already. Our supply line is in danger of getting cut off, any trucks coming to evac the seriously injured are a no-show. Orders came down to sit tight and buckle down. 



The downtime isn't as pleasant as we were hoping. We make small talk with those who are awake, keeping them comfortable and calm as time drags on. Pastor Louis seems thrilled we will be staying longer, I wish I held the same excitement as he did. Now we play the waiting game, trying our damndest to keep the rot from setting in on some of the more seriously wounded. The smell of the church resembles hot cheese and curdled milk. They writhe in agony, and our only solution for their cries is more morphine and sulfa powder, which is running low along with fresh dressings. 



***-Early Evening***

Henry's been keeping spirits high, he even managed to get a couple chuckles from Pastor Louis. Who would've thought a surgeon like me would be getting drunk with a french priest and some kid from southern ohio? I gotta say, not how I pictured all this unfolding. If you're reading this Susie, please know I think about you every day. Your photo and Henry's booze stash are the only things I really have to look forward to while here. 



**Sept.16th**

***-Early Morning***

Heard a wolf crying early this morning, guess Tommy was right. Was having a dream I was back home, Wish it hadn't woken me up. Henry couldn't sleep either so we decided to push through with more pisspoor coffee and a couple german cigarettes. Might take a habit home with me before this is all done. I see why Louis is never seen without one.



Henry got word from one of the RTO's that our trucks are about 2 days out, roads got blown to shit. Just our damn luck. Shermans were fine, one lost its tracks and had to be abandoned. 



Found myself re-reading the letters Susie sent me. I wish my hand writing was as elegant as hers. Hopefully the ring I got waiting for her will make up for my bad correspondence, keeping a happy face in these letters is getting harder and harder to manage. Cant have her worried sick over me.



 I'll be alright, just gotta keep on keeping on. One foot in front of the other as Ma used to say.



Louis didn't come out for breakfast like he usually does, rough night for all us I guess. Saw the doctor and him arguing before turning in. They aren't our captives, if they want to leave no one here would blame them.



***-Mid Day***

A couple of the prisoners are missing, apparently a small group managed to slip through the line and booked it into the woods last night. Patrols getting sent out now, Henry volunteered despite my protests. 



We need all able bodied medics in peak condition, if a stray round were to take him out, we'd be in a world of hurt.



His booze must be running low because he's getting more antsy by the hour. Maybe some time in the field might do him some good, realizing how blessed we are to have the option to stay back. Getting shot is at the bottom of my list of priorities.



***-Early Evening*** 

Remains found just outside the woodline. One prisoner survived, looks like they hit a patch of landmines. Odd thing is, there doesn't appear to be any signs of an explosion, just the aftermath.



Entrails had been sent into the trees, Henry described it as looking like some hellish mobile. Not much to bring back, burned the remains at the spot. 



The Kraut was huddled in an old uprooted stump, clutching a rosary and reciting some prayers. Managed to get him back to the barn, Henry's trying to calm him down now. He keeps repeating something in German, won't take his eyes off the woodline. 



Weird, all this is just weird. His back looked like he was dragged 50 miles behind a truck. Large strips of flesh were missing, along with 2 inch deep holes along his shoulder blade. Muscle got severed, leaving his left arm dead by his side. Not much we could do other than pack the wounds and hope for the best.



Could have been from a wolf, but the size was closer to a bear. Teeth matched with a canine bite though.  



Tried having Henry translate what he was saying, kept freaking out when we tried getting him to recount what happened. One thing that stood out was the phrase “groser zahn”, he kept repeating that over and over again. Apparently it translates to “big tooth”. 



Could a pack of wolves really do this much damage to the feared Wehrmacht? 



Planning on setting up some precautions around the church, last thing we need is a pack of wild animals with a taste for blood wandering about.



***-Late Evening*** 

Pastor Louis managed to calm the man down a bit, afterwards he looked like he had just seen the devil himself. Told me to give the man what he needed, I didn't have the heart to tell him we were on strict orders to keep the prisoners, not treat them.



I pray the trucks get here swiftly. I'm ready to leave this awful place far behind me. I pity the families that will return to see their homes and history as nothing more than piles of burning rubble.



Dinner was cold and tasteless. Never been a fan of cabbage, nor soup. Henry suggested adding bits of bread to help with the flavor, it just made the mush more solid. 



\-Note to self: never take cooking advice from a man with a drinking problem. Guarantee the cooks could serve up fried rats and Henry would go hog wild. I'd kill for a nice cut of steak right about now. 



Dessert was the usual, cigarettes and old booze. I was right, Henry's stash is officially running low.



Pastor Louis actually joined us tonight, I think it's the first time I've seen him since we tended to the Lucky Kraut. His once hopeful expression has been replaced with a more somber tone. We offered him some food but he politely declined, instead holding up a half empty bottle.



As we drank, I could tell something was bothering Louis. He didn't take his eyes off the fire. Each inhale of his cigarette seemed shaky and troubled, and all attempts at conversation were cut short. 



Finally, after his third cigarette, he started telling us a story about his grandfather.



Long ago, back when his grandfather was just a bishop at the church, a harsh winter hit. Sickness spread, killing off most of the livestock. Food was scarce and people were frightened. 



On top of the dire circumstances, the ground was frozen solid, resulting in the bodies laying out in the open for days on end.



It wasn't long before they started going missing, being dragged off in the night, followed by sightings of a large, hungry animal. 



He claims a spirit started stalking the village.



Their remains would be found just outside the treeline, picked clean and arranged in odd formations. The skulls were found shattered like egg shells, entrails impossibly high in the trees. 



Word began to spread, and the people grew more weary of the woods. Curfews were set in place, and hunters wouldn't be allowed to venture in unless accompanied by another and a pack of dogs. 



Then, one night, a little girl went missing. Her mother came downstairs to see the front window smashed in, and a large black mass, holding the child in its mouth. Before she could react, it scampered off into the treeline. By the time his grandfather found the poor woman, frostbite had taken most of her fingers. 



It was growing more bold. Reports came in of it pulling children and men alike out of their beds, dragging them into the woodline to feast on their blood and bones. 



It had gotten so bad that even the dogs would shake and whimper when taken out to hunt game. 



The people thought they were cursed, and death itself was preying on them.



While coming home late from the grieving mothers house,  he saw it, dragging one of the larger hunting dogs by the scruff of its neck. He described it as having the eyes of a madman, yet the snout of a wild animal. It stood a good 10 feet tall and was covered in thick, oily black fur. 



Henry interjected around this part of the story, mocking Louis and saying how foolish he was for believing in such silly tales as werewolves and monsters. 



Unbothered, he continued, never taking his eyes off the fire.



It just stood there, staring at him. Before his grandfather could react, it clutched the dog in its jaws and disappeared into the night, darting into the woods on all fours, the poor animal screaming in terror like a wild banshee.



I found myself being enamored by his story. Something in the way he shuddered recounting the events, almost like he himself had come face to face with the abomination. 



I asked what they did to stop the attacks from continuing, getting a concerning look from Henry. Before he could put his two cents in, I hit him hard in the shoulder. He muttered something along the lines of ‘crazy old men’ before getting up and heading to bed.



Pastor Louis said someone had the idea of making a deal with the spirit. The villagers would take offerings to the woodline, dumping the dead bodies and scraps in a pile as a sign of good faith to whatever was hunting them. Sometimes even entire deer were left, despite how the meat was so desperately needed.



For the most part, it worked, but if the sacrifice wasn't up to par, it would take someone, leaving their remains scattered about in those odd patterns. 



Over the decades, the practice was slowly forgotten, and the spirit was thought to have left. Now, Louis believed it had returned. He called it Remusius, the Wild Man. 



After he was finished, we both sat in silence. 



I have to admit, I'm not a superstitious man, but the way Louis kept rocking, maybe there's some truth hidden in this folk tale. 



Now, are we being hunted by some magical beast that eats flesh and crunches bones?



 I don't believe so, I think this is just a way for the locals to scare their children from wandering out late at night. 



My grandfather used to tell us stories of the Wendigo, a mythical creature that would hunt the woods of Appalachia. Usually, these were thinly veiled cautionary tales about the dangers of greed, starvation, and what happens when man consumes man, the cardinal sin of every culture across the globe.



As I got older, he told me how the depictions of these creatures matched what happened to a person's body after being slowly starved for months on end.



Just as I use this journal, these stories are ways to cope with the brutality the world often brings.



I'm left alone by the fire now, the only thing to accompany me Is the smell of snow being carried on the wind. Soon, we will experience our first frost. 



Trucks are only a few days out. Lord, please protect those boys and give them a safe and swift travel



**Sept.17th**

**-Dawn**

I found it hard getting to sleep last night. My dreams were of the woods. I was alone, cold and naked, being followed by something just outside my field of view. 



I would awake right as it made its presence known, drenched in sweat and shivering violently. 



No more ghost stories before bed.



Henry avoided Louis and I for most of the morning. From the looks of him, he didn't get much sleep either. Other than refilling his coffee passive aggressively, he didn't so much as make eye contact with us. 



I get things are hard here, they're hard on all of us, but that doesn't give him a right to shut us out just because he's scared. It isn't our fault we are in this mess, i didn’t hold a gun to his head, telling him to enlist or else. Like myself, it was a stupid, rash decision based on emotion.



Maybe I'm too hard on the kid, he's only 20 and has more life experience than most people I know in their late 50s. Besides, at the time, he probably thought he was doing something brave.



I think Susie's worrying has officially rubbed off on me. If I intend on making it home in one piece, I need to keep my mind steady. No room for doubt, only foolish hope i guess. 



***-Early Morning***

Started packing up what we could from the church. Lost two more last night to fever. Henry had gotten close with one of the men. Told him we can't get attached, but what can I expect? 



There are a few here I myself have made false promises to, not out of spite, rather pity. What else am I supposed to do when a man's entrails are littered across the ground and there's nothing to do? Tell him he's made the ultimate sacrifice? That uncle sam is proud? 



No. I go back to the same routine as Henry, lying to their faces that they're fine, we’re here to help we say, while administering a lethal amount of morphine to stop them from sobbing. 



At least their final moments will be painless…



Oh god Susie, I just want to be back home with you. I can feel myself cracking from the pressure. I think you were right. I should've stuck with my brothers at the infirmary on base. I could’ve stayed far away from this carnage and death. What the hell was I thinking?



Now, I'm the unfortunate soul that has to pick through the corpses, watching them slip to madness as the sickness spreads. Unrelenting. Uncaring. Dying cold and alone thousands of miles from loved ones. Mothers sending letters to sons that will never receive them, letters unfinished to sweethearts sending the same false promises i send susie. 



I'll be alright.



I'll make it home.



Don't you worry.



We collect their letters, trying our best to finish what they couldn’t. False hope, everything we do is built on false hope…



It isn't even mid-day yet and I'm already feeling myself growing thirsty.



\-***High Noon***

Chores go by too swiftly with all the anxious able bodies standing about. It seems we aren't the only ones anxious to get moving. Henry and I will most likely go back to the front lines in about 2 weeks time, resupplying and tagging along the next shipment of young men. 



Those who are with us now however, they have a long while before they'll have warm beds and good food. 



Rumors are being whispered that they won't rest until Paris is taken and secured. These same men tell stories of the Red Army, originally thought to be on the run, making an emese comeback and slowly regaining territory from the Krauts. 



I spent some time day dreaming of when we see soviet soldiers emerging from the front lines, with fresh bottles of Vodka and legions of Russian crafted armor made from american parts, bringing peace to the west as we quell the savageness of the east.



Maybe at the end of all this, at the end of the fighting, end of the discourse, brother killing brother, the world will finally emerge united under the bloodshed. Under the unified loss of a million, billion lives. Maybe this will be the war to end all wars. Maybe, just maybe.



***-Early Evening***

Henry's finally out of his mood, now he's an addict in desperate need of a fix. Although we had a bottle and a half left of the brits whiskey, im guessing he finished it after chores.



Pastor Louis gathered us before dinner, making sure we were alone and in private. Before Henry or I could question his motives, he led us to an old root cellar at the back of the church. He had kept it mostly hidden under some rubble, stating tonight was cause for celebration. 



When we entered the small, dirtfloor room, we could see why he kept it hidden. From mud the ceiling, safe from the war just outside, housed a massive wine reserve. The dirt and dust coated bottles were breathtakingly beautiful, and I felt myself almost grow emotional from the sight. 



The doctor and his wife joined us, along with their little girl. We gathered a few field medics and proceeded to celebrate. What exactly, I couldn't tell you, I was so drunk off wine I had almost forgotten where we were. 



***-Late Evening*** 

The night was filled with singing, dancing, even a couple of the sergeants allowed their men to cut loose. Before long, our celebration had leaked from the rootseller and was overspilling into the courtyard. Henry and I chased one another like schoolboys, prancing about gaily as if we had no cares in the world. By the time midnight had struck, the party was slowly fizzling out.



Before we turned in, Henry, The Doctor, Louis and myself all shared stories of years gone by. 



Louis spoke of his time before priesthood, where his habits almost landed him in a mad house. 



Henry told the story of how an unruly mustang almost bucked him onto a barbed wire fence, only being saved by his fathers quick reaction, pulling the boy to safety at the last moment. 



The Doctor reminisced when he had served in the great war, meeting his wife in a similar field hospital we were running. After it was over, they set up shop here, helping for little to no charge for those in need.



I told them about you Susie. I showed them the ring, told them how excited I am to finally start a life with you once I'm home. Told them about Ma, the boys, our little piece of heaven waiting. Told them they all had a place if they found themselves on our side of the world.



I used to drink to forget my pain, but you taught me to cherish every moment we have in this life. 



Now, I drink in remembrance. Those dark urges are still present, but quieter and more manageable. You ground me Susie, it may be the wine talking, but I love you. I need to tell you that more. You deserve the man you see me to be. 



**Sept. 18th**

***-Dawn***

Something got into the church last night. Around 3 am it broke down our barricade and slaughtered 3 men. 



We caught a glimpse of it with a man clutched in its jaws, back turned toward us.



It stood at least 12 feet tall, bipedal, unlike anything I've ever encountered in my 26 years of living. We shot at it twice, Henry’s shot missing but capturing its attention away from the others. 



That mouth, dripping wet with fangs as long as carpenter nails. It bore us down with no fear, no shift in posture. Its proportions felt wrong and unnatural.



I took the second shot, grazing its head. That was enough to startle it into a retreat, disappearing in the direction of the woods.



The noise, oh god, that awful wail it released. I thought I had struck a child with how unnerved I was by its guttural shriek. When the others came, it was long gone. By daybreak, we found their remains near the woodline, similar to the Germans who tried escaping two days prior. 



The C.O. shooed Louis off half way through his account, and when ours matched that of the Mad Priest, words like court-martialed and committed for battle fatigue were thrown about. 



But I know what I saw. Could smell the rot emitting off that foul creature, and watched as it dropped on all fours and scampered off like a beast from hell itself. The survivors didn't see much, but attested the attack wasn't kraut in nature.



I'm not a superstitious man, but that thing scared me.



***-Early Morning*** 



The trucks are less than 2 hours out and I'm beside myself trying to get everyone ready for the move.

How does something like this happen? How could we be so stupid as to let our guard down? Those men and their well beings fall on my shoulders, they are my responsibility, and I failed them. 



\-***Noon***

The Doctor's daughter is missing.



Henry wants to stay, I don't know what to do.



I spoke with Louis after loading the last of the men on board. He thinks she's alive, and it's baiting us into the forest. I asked him if he could use a rifle, he said he could. 



***-Early Evening***

We are setting up a small camp on the outskirts of the woods. Two men offered to stay back with us in search of the girl, but we were given strict orders to rendezvous in 3 hours with artillery, or suffer the consequences that follow desertion. 



Luckily, she was safe. 



We found her in a small clearing, playing without a care in the world. Bones littered the edges of the foliage, with what appeared to be an elk skull hanging from a young tree branch. 



She had decided to go exploring. She had gotten lost but said she knew we were coming. The doctor left with the other two, but we decided to stay.



Something is out here, something old and vicious in spirit. Louis and I think we know how to stop it, Henry says he knows how to track it if this works. We don't aim to kill it, if it can be killed. We just want it gone. 



Henry confided in us while we were wiring the explosives that he kept having nightmares of the beast we saw. Every night it was the same, being cold, naked and alone as it hunted us. Now, we attempt to hunt it, armed and ready this time.



Even as I write this I can't help but feel a bit foolish. 



Maybe this is all in our heads, a case of mass hysteria. That would explain everything perfectly, I had a nervous breakdown and hallucinated this demon in sight of a brutal massacre of innocent, helpless men. Louis’s story just amplified its effect, feeding into our paranoia and exhaustion.



But I believe what I saw, and I can't let my fear allow another innocent life to be lost. Im a steady shot, Henry is too brave for his own good, and Pastor Louis… 



He's a good man. He shouldn't go at this alone.



I Love You Susie, and when I get home, I'm making you my wife. I'll be the man you need me to be, and the father our child will be proud of. One who's not scared to fight off the monsters.

Palagi ako nag iipon. After I finished saving for my emergency fund good for 12 months, I save about 65% of my salary and invest some of it in mp2, putting it on digi banks para sa interest, and pay some insurances. Planning to invest in mutual funds and buy some land na rin for future investments. lahat ng tira on my money ay sa bills na. I make pretty okay income wise. not much, but comfy for someone who's single and lives alone. I also do freelance work on the side so may extra income din. Di lang talaga ako magastos. I work from home (so no need to buy a car), don't go out, and rarely buy wants kasi usually needs lang binibili ko. I also don't shop branded items unless worth it. At kung bibili man ako, I make sure na kailangan ko talaga, like my phone, sabi ko bibili lang ako pag di na talaga pwede maidaan sa phone repair yung phone ko lol. (I've been using this for about 5 years and still not lagging so mukhang I'm not changing it anytime soon haha.) when it comes to beauty care naman, I prefer to learn and do them myself like tailoring my own clothes, cleaning my own nails, or cutting my own hair instead of going to salons every few months. I also don't like going to coffee shops, so di ko trip mag SB every week haha. I cook most of my meals and rarely eat out unless may kasama. I have a credit card but I only use it for convenience, and I always pay on time and in full before the due date if ever gagamitin since ayoko magka utang.

Siguro the only non-negotiables for me would be, paying for grab if ever lalabas ako, or when I give gifts to super close friends/relatives.

With what I earn and save, I can easily buy anything I want, travel whenever I want or treat myself whenever, pero I just prefer to save my money kasi naprapraning ako sa future and I always want to be prepared. I never wanna be broke or have money problems.

Sometimes I feel like I might be saving too much and I might be missing out on a lot in life? my cousins and friends na same age ko, they get the latest gadgets, have their own cars, branded clothes and travel every few months. Kaya ko rin naman, pero parang I prefer not to? Di ko rin maiiwasan yung unting self pity tho, na para bang ""ay sana may ganyan din ako"" eh I can get it if I want it naman, kaso iniisip ko rin kasi yung future ko, and I prefer to build first before getting my wants.

Makes me wonder, am I doing this whole road-to-financial-stability thing correctly? or baka nasobrahan na. Should I be enjoying my money? Will I regret not enjoying my money now while I'm still young?

Would love some thoughts. TIA!",31,1764044904.0,adultingph,30,0.95,False

# Being Lady Luck was not just a title; it was a relentless burden. After much contemplation, I resolved to experience life anew as a privileged heiress, a position that promised ease and indulgence.

Yet, fate had other plans. My mother had been disowned by her affluent family, all because she had failed to bear a son.

My father, Nathan Hoffman, regarded her growing belly with a look of utter disdain, as if it were a mere inconvenience. “Stop wasting your energy. You’ll never have a son,” he declared coldly, his voice laced with a harsh finality.

The color drained from my mother’s face, a palpable wave of despair washing over her. “No… I’ll give you a son…” she whispered, desperation creeping into her tone.

I felt an overwhelming wave of sympathy for her in that moment. It was then that I resolved to help her acquire 1.5 billion dollars—an amount that might just impress those heartless individuals who had turned their backs on her.

\*\*\*

My name is Meredith Hoffman. In my previous existence, I was known as Lady Luck, a being who wielded fortune like a weapon.

In this life, however, my aspirations were more grounded. I simply wished to be a wealthy heiress, basking in luxury and pleasure.

I found myself reincarnated within the womb of Chelsea Terrell, a woman caught in a web of familial expectations and societal pressures.

And here I was, still a girl.

My father, Nathan Hoffman, a titan in the world of business with a net worth in the billions, was fixated on the idea of a male heir to carry forth his legacy.

At this moment, I floated in warm amniotic fluid, enveloped in a cocoon of safety, while the muffled sounds of my mother’s quiet sobs echoed around me.

Seated across from her was my grandmother, Matilda Hoffman, a woman whose presence radiated authority. She cradled a coffee cup in her hands, leisurely skimming the foam as if time were an endless resource.

“Chelsea, what Nathan says goes for me, too,” she stated, her tone devoid of warmth.

“You need to abort this child.”

My mother’s sobs ceased abruptly.

She lifted her head, her eyes swollen and red, her voice trembling as she pleaded, “Matilda, the ultrasound can be wrong, can’t it? What if… What if I’m carrying a son?”

Matilda’s patience snapped as she slammed her coffee cup down on the table, the sound reverberating through the room like a thunderclap.

“No what ifs.

“Lorelei is four months pregnant. The doctor checked and confirmed it’s a boy.”

Lorelei Sutton was my father’s mistress, a fact that twisted like a knife in my mother’s heart.

Mom gripped her dress so tightly that her knuckles turned ghostly white.

“Just because she’s having a son, I have to get rid of my unborn baby?” she challenged, her voice rising with indignation.

A cold voice sliced through the tension from the doorway. “Yes!”

It was Nathan, striding in with an air of authority that chilled the room.

He fixed his gaze on my mother, his eyes devoid of any warmth or compassion. “Chelsea, don’t make this awkward for yourself,” he admonished.

With a swift motion, he retrieved a document from his suit pocket and tossed it onto the table with a casual flick of his wrist.

“Sign it, and this villa plus 1.5 million dollars are yours. It’s more than enough to ensure you live in comfort for the rest of your life.”

My mother’s eyes locked onto the document, the words “Divorce Agreement” searing into her mind like a brand.

Her body swayed, and for a moment, it seemed as though she might collapse under the weight of his betrayal.

1.5 million dollars.

To rid himself of his wife, who was seven months pregnant with his child.

How generous of him.

Mom let out a bitter laugh, a sound that was more of a choked sob than anything else. “Nathan, this is your child, too.

“How could you be so heartless?”

Nathan frowned, clearly irritated by her emotional response.

“I told you we needed a male heir.

“If you can’t give birth to a son, you have to step aside.”

His tone dripped with self-righteousness, an arrogance that made my heart ache for my mother.

In that moment, I could feel her heart racing, a sharp, overwhelming pain piercing through the amniotic fluid that surrounded me.

No. She couldn’t remain passive in the face of such cruelty.

I focused all my energy, sending a thought directly into her mind.

“Mom, don’t cry.

“Agree to the divorce first. Just hold them off.”

Mom froze, her eyes wide with shock.

She looked around as if searching for the source of the voice.

“You can’t see me. I’m in your belly.

“I’m your daughter, and I’m Lady Luck, here to help you.”

Her eyes widened further, a mixture of disbelief and awe washing over her.

Instinctively, she placed a trembling hand on her belly, as if to connect with me.

Matilda, growing impatient with the silence, interjected sharply.

“Chelsea, you have one day to think about it.

“If you haven’t signed by this time tomorrow, you’ll regret it.”

With that, she and Nathan turned on their heels, leaving my mother alone in the room, the door clicking shut behind them.

Mom stood there, frozen in place, the weight of their words heavy in the air.

After what felt like an eternity, she finally spoke, her voice quivering. “You… you were the one talking to me just now?”

“Yes. Mom, it’s me,” I replied, my voice a steady beacon in the storm of her emotions.

“Don’t be scared. I’m with you. No one can bully us.”

Tears began to fall from her eyes again, but this time they were tinged with hope rather than despair.

She wiped them away, her resolve hardening as she picked up the divorce agreement from the table and tore it into shreds, the sound of paper ripping echoing like a declaration of war.

She murmured defiantly, “Do you think you can cast us aside with just 1.5 million dollars? Not a chance!”

“Mom, open your stock trading app,” I instructed her, my voice firm.

“Do as I say—go all in on stock code 002594.”

This mental connection drained me more than I anticipated, but I knew that my mother’s stunned expression was a testament to her realization that the guidance from her unborn daughter was her only lifeline.

With a shaky breath, she poured her last 15,000 dollars into that stock, her heart racing with a mix of fear and hope.

After placing her bet, she collapsed onto the sofa, her palms clammy with sweat, the weight of her decision pressing down on her.

The following day, the stock market opened with a bang.

That stock soared unexpectedly, breaking through daily limits one, two, and three times in a row.

In just three days, her initial investment of 15,000 dollars had transformed into a staggering 30,000 dollars.

Chelsea stared at the numbers in her account, her hands trembling with excitement, her heart pounding with disbelief.

For the first time, she truly felt the extraordinary power that coursed through me, a power that could change everything.",1,1764044740.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

I have been dreading telling my mom based on previous reactions anything I do that seems to go out of my way for my boyfriend is me “ not respecting myself.” My boyfriend gives me the whole world, is always coming over to see me, comes to see me for lunch at my campus, helps me with homework, is always willing to go with me to run errand some are even for my mom ( going to get her meds or picking up lunch or things for her office), never asks for a dime or anything in return. I try to do everything I can to repay him for all this but am often made to feel guilty by my mother. She knows my boyfriend well enough since he is over all the time and they have known each other since both him and I were in high school. Whenever he is not over for even a day during his off days she gets suspicious and tries to insinuate that he doesn’t care about me and guilt trip me into feeling some kind of way that he couldn’t come over when I know that he is either helping his own family or just taking personal rest and even when I tell her that she still makes comments about it. It is very hard for me to stick up for myself but really only when it comes to her, I get choked up when it comes to confronting her or when she gets mad about grades or money. So you can probably understand why I am uneasy about telling her I was invited and want to go and be there with my boyfriend and his family, as I am not over to see them as much as he is over to see my family. My mom likes to host Thanksgiving every year as well as Christmas ( which my boyfriend has come to before) in the past few years it was held at my Aunts house and then we were on vacation and did not have a proper sit down dinner. So this will be the first time in a while we have had Thanksgiving together. I really want to be there for my family too as Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays so my boyfriend and I came to a compromise, We would go to his families house for dinner and then if it was not to late at night he would come with me to my house for desserts and coffee. I think this is a fair solution as it still fits both our families in, if all goes well, if it gets too late for us to go to my house I am not too concerned, but if we have the chance to go I would like too. My boyfriend agreed, which just left telling my mom. I am actually kind of scared to tell her because my mom does so much for me and spoils the shit out of me and I couldn’t be more grateful, I try to do everything I can to help her in return ( running errands, cleaning the house, doing laundry, taking care of the dog, grocery shopping etc. ) but I can’t please everyone all the time ( I am an avid people pleaser and try to take care of everyones feelings) so I do what I can. I am afraid she will hold my grades and the things she has paid for over my head to make me stay for Thanksgiving. I will try to stand up to her tomorrow, but any advice would be appreciated. 

Short version: Am I wrong for telling my mom I want to be there for my boyfriend’s Thanksgiving after he is always there for me and my family? - she’s a narcissasitic and guilt tripping mother, what do I do? ",1,1764044681.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

1p63371,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_lionheartclinic/comments/1p63371/how_to_manage_hot_flashes_during_menopause/,How to Manage Hot Flashes During Menopause,"Hot flashes are one of the most common and noticeable symptoms of menopause. They can strike anytime — day or night — leaving women feeling flushed, sweaty, and uncomfortable. While hot flashes are a normal part of the menopausal transition, they can disrupt daily life, affect sleep, and even impact emotional well-being. Fortunately, there are several effective ways to manage and reduce them naturally and medically.

https://preview.redd.it/9pptvhk6yb3g1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=145901393cf030bacfeb9c829b49694499e827b6

[](https://lionheartclinic.com/new-patients/)

What Are Hot Flashes and Why Do They Happen?

Hot flashes occur due to hormonal changes — primarily a drop in estrogen levels — that affect the body’s temperature regulation. During menopause, the hypothalamus (your internal thermostat) becomes more sensitive to slight changes in body temperature, triggering sudden heat waves, sweating, and flushing.

Each woman’s experience is different. Some may have mild, occasional flashes, while others deal with frequent and intense episodes. The key to managing them lies in understanding your body and adopting a combination of lifestyle and dietary adjustments.

1. Keep Your Cool

Managing body temperature is one of the simplest ways to minimize hot flashes.

• Dress in layers: Wear lightweight, breathable fabrics like cotton or linen so you can easily adjust when a flash hits.

• Stay in cool environments: Keep a fan nearby or lower your room temperature, especially while sleeping.

• Cold water therapy: Sipping cold water or applying a cool towel on your neck can provide instant relief during a flash.

• Avoid overheating triggers: Hot rooms, saunas, and direct sunlight can worsen symptoms.

2. Identify and Avoid Triggers

Certain foods, drinks, and habits can trigger or intensify hot flashes. Tracking these triggers helps you manage them better. Common triggers include:

[• Spicy foods](https://lionheartclinic.com/new-patients/)

[• Caffeine (coffee, tea, and energy drinks)](https://lionheartclinic.com/new-patients/)

[• Alcohol](https://lionheartclinic.com/new-patients/)

[• Smoking](https://lionheartclinic.com/new-patients/)

[• Stress or anxiety](https://lionheartclinic.com/new-patients/)

Try keeping a symptom diary to note what you eat and when hot flashes occur. Over time, patterns become clear, helping you make informed choices.

Mom let out a bitter laugh, a sound that was more of a choked sob than anything else. “Nathan, this is your child, too.

“How could you be so heartless?”

Nathan frowned, clearly irritated by her emotional response.

“I told you we needed a male heir.

“If you can’t give birth to a son, you have to step aside.”

His tone dripped with self-righteousness, an arrogance that made my heart ache for my mother.

In that moment, I could feel her heart racing, a sharp, overwhelming pain piercing through the amniotic fluid that surrounded me.

No. She couldn’t remain passive in the face of such cruelty.

I focused all my energy, sending a thought directly into her mind.

“Mom, don’t cry.

“Agree to the divorce first. Just hold them off.”

Mom froze, her eyes wide with shock.

She looked around as if searching for the source of the voice.

“You can’t see me. I’m in your belly.

“I’m your daughter, and I’m Lady Luck, here to help you.”

Her eyes widened further, a mixture of disbelief and awe washing over her.

Instinctively, she placed a trembling hand on her belly, as if to connect with me.

Matilda, growing impatient with the silence, interjected sharply.

“Chelsea, you have one day to think about it.

“If you haven’t signed by this time tomorrow, you’ll regret it.”

With that, she and Nathan turned on their heels, leaving my mother alone in the room, the door clicking shut behind them.

Mom stood there, frozen in place, the weight of their words heavy in the air.

After what felt like an eternity, she finally spoke, her voice quivering. “You… you were the one talking to me just now?”

“Yes. Mom, it’s me,” I replied, my voice a steady beacon in the storm of her emotions.

“Don’t be scared. I’m with you. No one can bully us.”

Tears began to fall from her eyes again, but this time they were tinged with hope rather than despair.

She wiped them away, her resolve hardening as she picked up the divorce agreement from the table and tore it into shreds, the sound of paper ripping echoing like a declaration of war.

She murmured defiantly, “Do you think you can cast us aside with just 1.5 million dollars? Not a chance!”

“Mom, open your stock trading app,” I instructed her, my voice firm.

“Do as I say—go all in on stock code 002594.”

This mental connection drained me more than I anticipated, but I knew that my mother’s stunned expression was a testament to her realization that the guidance from her unborn daughter was her only lifeline.

With a shaky breath, she poured her last 15,000 dollars into that stock, her heart racing with a mix of fear and hope.

After placing her bet, she collapsed onto the sofa, her palms clammy with sweat, the weight of her decision pressing down on her.

The following day, the stock market opened with a bang.

That stock soared unexpectedly, breaking through daily limits one, two, and three times in a row.

In just three days, her initial investment of 15,000 dollars had transformed into a staggering 30,000 dollars.

Chelsea stared at the numbers in her account, her hands trembling with excitement, her heart pounding with disbelief.

For the first time, she truly felt the extraordinary power that coursed through me, a power that could change everything.",1,1764044529.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False
