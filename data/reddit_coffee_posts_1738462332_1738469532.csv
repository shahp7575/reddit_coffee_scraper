Puerto Ricans in Space     
presents     
     
### **The Tea Rebellion of Casa Montalvo**     
     
**Part 1: The Encroachment**

The harbormaster at San Juan did not expect the tea. Neither did Sebasti√°n Montalvo.

A single ship, bearing a flag of the East India Company, had slipped into the harbor under the cover of dawn. Its cargo‚Äîtea leaves, dried and pressed into tight bricks‚Äîwas smuggled ashore with haste. The dockworkers, accustomed to sacks of coffee beans perfuming the air with their familiar, earthy aroma, paused to sniff at the alien scent. It was subtle, floral‚Äîunmistakably foreign.

Word traveled fast. The Puerto Rican Coffee Cartel, a council of landowners and merchants led by Montalvo himself, had kept the island‚Äôs veins filled with coffee for generations. The cartel was more than commerce‚Äîit was culture, identity, power. Tea was a quiet invasion, a threat wrapped in delicate leaves.

By midday, the intelligentsia council had convened deep within Casa Montalvo, the mountain stronghold carved into the cliffs above the rainforest. Sebasti√°n, draped in the fine linen of the old Spanish elite, sat at the head of the chamber. Maps of trade routes, intercepted messages, and diagrams of port shipments lay scattered across the long table before him.

‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ pollutant,‚Äù he sneered, ‚Äúwill be eradicated before it takes root.‚Äù

The council murmured in agreement. Coffee was the pulse of the island, the rhythm of morning prayers and midnight conspiracies. Tea? Tea was soft, a beverage for poets and courtiers, not revolutionaries.

But one revolutionary had already set his sights on it.

**Part 2: Puerto Rican Robin Hood**

He had many names. To the poor, he was El Vengador del Pueblo. To Sebasti√°n‚Äôs enforcers, he was a ghost, a nuisance, a myth that refused to die.

Puerto Rican Robin Hood did not steal for wealth‚Äîhe stole for balance.

That night, beneath a sky soaked in the scent of concrete and storm, he and his band of thieves slipped past the harbor guards, dismantled the locks on the tea shipments, and vanished into the night with the crates in tow.

By dawn, the tea had flooded the barrios. In small clay mugs and battered tin cups, people sipped uncertainly. Some welcomed the change, warming their hands around new flavors. Others spat it onto the ground, offended by its smoothness, its lack of bite.

But the loyalists‚Äîthe coffee faithful‚Äîwere the angriest of all.

‚Äú¬°Esto es una maldita traici√≥n!‚Äù one shouted, hurling a cup into the dirt. The old woman beside him wept. ‚ÄúHave we not suffered enough?‚Äù

By midday, the crates had been found and seized by Montalvo‚Äôs guards. The cartel moved swiftly, reclaiming their territory.

But Puerto Rican Robin Hood did not let insults go unanswered.

**Part 3: The Return to Casa Montalvo**

The fortress at Casa Montalvo was as much a statement as it was a defense. Built into the cliffs, it oversaw the jungle with an unblinking gaze, its stone walls lined with guards who drank espresso so thick it clung to their teeth.

Breaking in was suicide.

Breaking in twice was legend.

Under the cover of night, Robin Hood infiltrated the stronghold. He moved through the old tunnels, tunnels carved by enslaved hands centuries before, tunnels that the cartel had forgotten existed. The scent of roasted beans lingered in the air, masking his movements as he weaved through the granite hallways.

The tea was stored in the great hall, its crates piled like forgotten treasure. A brazier had been lit‚ÄîMontalvo intended to burn it, to erase the heresy from his domain.

Robin Hood had minutes.

A single, well-placed spark ignited a nearby stack of Puerto Rican crowns. The room erupted into pandemonium. In the chaos, he grabbed what he could‚Äîtwo sacks of tea, perhaps three‚Äîbefore leaping onto the stone balcony.

The guards saw him too late. He fought off the bolder of the few then leaped from the parapet, disappearing into the trees below.

By the time Montalvo reached the smoldering hall, the scent of burning cash mingled with the faint floral ghost of tea.

Robin Hood had won the night. But the war for Puerto Rico‚Äôs soul had only begun.

Im not completely inactive, i do a decent amount of walking but I admit it could be better. But could both of those really cause symptoms so scary?
My heart palpitations have been around since high school. 4 years ago, the worst would be my heart skipping every 2 beats for maybe 5 minutes after a long day.  Then i could go about my day like normal after. 
3 years ago it started skippimg every other beat for 5 minutes just after going to school? I went to a cardiologist and they found nothing. 
I figured that would be it. But now the palpitations have gotten bad. 
Last year sometimes my heart would skip every other beat for as long as 30 minutes straight. It would especially get bad on my period. I figured it was anemia. But my doctor said my anemia wasnt actually that bad. 
Tonight they were bad. All i did was go to a coffee shop with friends and draw all day. On my way home, my heart skipped beats while also following an inconsistent rhythm. It would speed up and slow down. Three fast beets two slow beats. Every other beat. 
But the reason ive let people convince me it‚Äôs anxiety is because these ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù would only result in some minor pinching in the chest. No pain. Dizziness. Shaking and brain fog. Which are all things i get when im anxious too. I breath fine too. And laying down on my back helps a lot. But tonight was really scary.

This 22-inch champagne beauty promised a solution to all my travel woes. The moment it arrived, I was eager to take it out for a spin‚Äîliterally.

This is one of those bags that instantly makes an impression. The champagne color is sleek and stylish, and the polyester fabric feels both lightweight and durable. It boasts a water-repellent Duraguard coating, which came in handy when I unknowingly dragged it through a rain-soaked street. Surprisingly, not a drop seeped through. Plus, the stain-resistant feature meant no worries about those inevitable coffee spills while waiting at the airport.

[Check Travelpro Maxlite 5 price on Amazon now.](https://bagsby.com/product-reviews/travelpro-401172235-review-lightweight-luggage-b0b72bl6sx/)

**Design & Build Quality**

The design? Sophisticated yet functional. Although the bag is lightweight at just 5.4 pounds, the material doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy or cheap. I‚Äôve taken it through domestic flights, international train rides, and even across cobblestone streets in Europe. It held up remarkably well, with only minor scuff marks on the wheels. However, the zippers, while ergonomic and smooth, could be a bit more heavy-duty. I did notice slight fraying on the zipper seams after multiple uses.

**Wheels & Mobility**

With two high-performance ball-bearing wheels instead of four spinner ones, I was initially skeptical about its mobility. But boy, was I wrong! The wheels glide like butter on smooth surfaces, and their stability on uneven terrain is impressive. During a mad dash to catch a connecting flight, this bag didn‚Äôt wobble or tip once. Still, it‚Äôs worth noting that spinner wheels would make maneuvering in tight spaces easier.

**Handles & Comfort**

The PowerScope Lite telescoping handle is a winner. It has adjustable stops at 38 and 42.5 inches, catering to both petite and tall travelers. I often find carry-on handles either too short or uncomfortably long, but this one felt just right. The grip is ergonomically designed, making it comfortable to pull even when the bag is fully packed. The top and side carry handles are padded, providing extra convenience when lifting into overhead bins.

**Security Features**

While the zippers are generally durable, they lack built-in locks. This isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker, as I use TSA-approved luggage locks, but it‚Äôs something to consider. The absence of advanced security features like anti-theft zippers might make some travelers uneasy, especially on international trips.

**Organization & Compartments**

Now, let‚Äôs talk about packing efficiency. I‚Äôm a chronic over-packer, and this bag‚Äôs expandable feature (up to 2 inches) was a blessing. Inside, you‚Äôll find adjustable hold-down straps, a full-length interior lid pocket, and a side accessory pocket. These compartments made organizing a breeze. Two exterior compartments were perfect for stashing my travel documents and a light jacket. However, the interior plaid fabric design wasn‚Äôt my favorite. It‚Äôs functional, yes, but not the most aesthetically pleasing.

**Controls & Features**

Although this isn‚Äôt a tech-heavy bag, its intuitive features make it user-friendly. The expandable zipper mechanism works smoothly, and the overall design prioritizes practicality over unnecessary frills.

**Durability**

After several trips, the bag has maintained its shape and functionality. That said, the feet at the bottom could use a redesign. They tend to wear out quickly, especially if you frequently check the bag in at airlines. I‚Äôve also noticed that the stitching around some seams is starting to loosen, though not enough to compromise the bag‚Äôs integrity.

**Water Resistance**

The Duraguard coating works wonders. During one particularly chaotic trip, I accidentally left the bag outside while it drizzled. Everything inside stayed dry. This feature makes it suitable for all-weather travel.

**Pros**

* Lightweight and easy to maneuver.
* Expandable capacity for extra packing space.
* Stain-resistant and water-repellent material.
* Comfortable telescoping handle with adjustable stops.
* Durable wheels that glide smoothly on various surfaces.

**Cons**

* Feet at the bottom prone to wear and tear.
* Zippers could be more robust for long-term use.
* Lacks built-in security features like TSA locks.
* Interior design is functional but not visually appealing.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to Samsonite's Omni PC Hardside Spinner, the Travelpro Maxlite 5 offers better weight management but lacks the rigidity of a hard-shell suitcase. The Samsonite is more suitable for protecting fragile items, while the Maxlite 5 excels in flexibility and lightweight travel. Against the Away Bigger Carry-On, Travelpro is more budget-friendly but misses out on the sleek design and built-in battery features of the Away.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

While the Maxlite 5 may not be the cheapest carry-on on the market, its features justify the price. The lightweight design, ample organizational space, and overall durability make it a worthwhile investment. It‚Äôs perfect for frequent travelers who need reliability without breaking the bank. That said, if you‚Äôre someone who needs extra security features or a more modern design, you may want to explore other options.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

i told myself i would focus on myself this year.

yet, here i am,
writing about you.

i lay awake at night,
and i think about the night you left.
i think about how you laid here with me,
holding me as i sobbed in your arms. 
i think about how i stared at your face,
trying to memorize it.
i think about how you sat in my pink dining room chairs and shattered my heart.
how i reached for my mug and the coffee spilled across my counter, staining the pristine marble brown. 

i think about when you left.
how you held my hands and said,
""I don't want you to think it's because I fell out of love with you.""
i hate it.
i wish you hadn't said that. 
because if you had fallen out of love with me,
at least i could reason that.
but i can't reason this.
i can't reason you leaving me because of how your parents felt about me. 

all i can think about is how i think you made the stupidest decision ever, letting something as incredible as our love pass you by.

all i can think about is how i want to go back.
i want you to reach out, to apologize.
to say ""Let's try again. ""

i've written countless poems,
hoping you'll see.
i want you to see them.
i want you to see how badly i'm hurting.

i know you've been watching my socials.

i want you to see my words and know that
deep down,
there's still a part of me that would forgive you.

maybe you'll see this, maybe you won't.

I walked back to my place shivering. The sun wasn‚Äôt high enough to properly heat up the day yet. Usually, this was my favourite time of day‚Äîthe basement suite didn‚Äôt have AC and turned borderline uninhabitable by the afternoon‚Äîbut I found myself wishing I could hit reset on the whole day.

It would be so nice if I woke up and realized this was only some messed up dream.

Instead, my wet socks squished inside my wet shoes and I dripped onto the sidewalk as I moved. In my pocket, my phone was fried. A new one would be hundreds of dollars that I absolutely did not have, especially since I was now out of a job.¬†

From the ancient payphone out front, I had called my boss and left a message about a burst pipe before locking the front door and tucking my key on top of the ice machine in front. Though I didn‚Äôt know his reply, I was sure I was out of a job. If (by some miracle) I wasn‚Äôt fired or sued, I really didn‚Äôt know I could return to the gas station and ever stand there comfortably after what that woman had done.¬†

I shivered again. Trouble, it seemed, had a way of finding me.¬†

By the time I got back to my place, my wet socks and shoes had done a number on my heels. A raw, red ache at the backs of my heels screamed at me. When I took off my shoes, I didn‚Äôt doubt that I‚Äôd have blisters that would make my life hell for the rest of the week. I fumbled with my key and opened the door.

Inside, Art was at the table. He shovelled a forkful of eggs into his mouth and didn‚Äôt look up from his phone. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre back early.‚Äù

I stood in the entryway. Water dropped from my shirt to the floor. ‚ÄúHi, Art.‚Äù

Finally, Art looked up. A bit of egg fell off his fork. He lifted his brow. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs raining?‚Äù

With a sigh, I kicked off my shoes. ‚ÄúNot exactly.‚Äù

I helped myself to a mug of coffee from the pot Art had made‚Äîa small comfort, even if Art complained that he wanted to warm his own cup up‚Äîand sat at the table across from him. I told him about my morning: the woman, the water, losing/quitting my job. He leaned in as I recounted it all to him.

When I was finished, Art pressed his lips together and rubbed his brow. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre sure it‚Äôs related to all this?‚Äù

‚ÄúNow that you mention it, I‚Äôm sure it was just a leaking pipe.‚Äù

He rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I meant. I just‚Äîwe don‚Äôt really know anything about the bigger picture here. Do we know it‚Äôs connected or could it just be a coincidence? Fisher said that magic was coming back.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was asking about the sword, Art.‚Äù I frowned. The warm coffee burned my fingers through the mug. ‚ÄúBut I have been thinking about that. Random magic, I mean. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs out there or how soon to expect it.‚Äù

My head hurt. I hadn‚Äôt had my coffee at the usual time, and now a wicked headache was coming to punish me for that. The sun streaming in through the small window only added to my frustration. I wanted a cool, dark room to rest in. All I had was this sweltering basement suite that got too much light and somehow was even hotter than outside.

As terrible as the place was, I also had to figure out how I‚Äôd scrape together enough to pay rent by month‚Äôs end because the basement that smelled like mildew was better than being homeless or moving back in with my mother in the middle of nowhere.

‚ÄúMartin?‚Äù Art asked. ‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúJust thinking through this month.‚Äù The thought of the looming bills and prospect of having to go back out and drop off resumes made my chest tighten.

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù Art gave me a wan smile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get back on your feet.‚Äù

My stomach twisted. He didn‚Äôt get it, not really. Even though he turned his back on his father‚Äîand I admired him for that, I really did‚Äîhe didn‚Äôt understand what it was like to always not have quite enough. He‚Äôd been making enough to cover his half of the rent through odd jobs and some tutoring, but he never seemed particularly concerned by (or even really aware of) the fact that we were both dangerously close to the wire.¬†

I finished my coffee and set it down on the table. It wasn‚Äôt even eight in the morning yet and my day felt longer than some weeks.

Art hesitated. ‚ÄúI should get going for work, but if you need I could call in sick?‚Äù

I waved him off. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

He looked visibly relieved.

I would be fine. I had to be. I had time before I‚Äôd have to be at the lab. At least I could catch some extra sleep.

1ifok14,https://i.redd.it/kz1jewsxenge1.jpeg,Review - explos√£o de papaya da astral torrefa√ß√£o,"Modera√ß√£o, adiciona a tag review a√≠ pra n√≥s meu chapa :D


Antes de come√ßar a review, quero ressaltar que antes de qualquer coisa, fui atr√°s de informa√ß√£o primeiro e, diante disso, eis minhas conclus√µes/review.

Obs: Eu n√£o sei como descrever esse cheiro de outra forma, mas quem j√° comprou caf√© descafeinado em gr√£os, vai entender qual √© o cheiro. Se algu√©m souber descrever tal sensorial, comenta ai por favor!

O caf√© chegou 30/01/25 com data de torra 23/01/2025.
Conforme meu post anterior, ao abrir o pacote estranhei um pouco o cheiro de caf√© descafeinado, mas ate ai, beleza. 

De cara, fiz uma moagem media fina, mesmo aroma de cafe decaf. segui a receita do froid662 pra b75, fez um bloom meio timido, 0 aroma novamente, passei a receita e fui pra x√≠cara. 

O sensorial foi ficando ok a medida que o caf√© esfriou e realmente deu a nota de papaya quando estava praticamente em temperatura ambiente. 

Mais tarde, fiz um v60 usando uma moagem media com 3 despejos, quase omesmo resultado do b75, s√≥ n ficou tao doce quanto no v60. 

Ate ent√£o, o sensorial tava meio fraco, s√≥ ficando legal com o caf√© em temperatura ambiente e o retrogosto tambem me lembrando o gosto do cheiro de caf√© descafeinado.

No p√≥s almoco, resolvi fazer um cupping comparando os 3 heirlooms que est√£o aqui, sendo eles: 
 Heirloom 74158 natural (Hyuga) - 15d de torra¬π
 Heirloom lavado(Hyuga) - 15d de torra¬π
Heirloom explos√£o de papaya (astral) - 9d de torra

Pro cupping, segui a recomenda√ß√£o de 1:18 na moagem grossa quebrando a costa aos 4m e provando os caf√©s em diferentes temperaturas at√© ficar frio.

Dos 3, somente o astral n√£o formou crosta  e estava claramente com gosto oxidado, pedi minha mae pra experimentar e ela detestou, disse que estava com gosto de coisa velha. Pra mim, me lembrou um caf√© tradicional sem amargor, totalmente flat com a √∫nica nota sendo esse ""oxidado"" que eu n√£o sei explicar.

Fiz a receita pra caf√©s velhos indicada pelo Lance neste v√≠deo [aqui](https://youtu.be/jz9fH5ODVFU?si=3dT0kmnm4iC-YYVl) √© o sensorial saiu, mas novamente, por que diabos um grao com torra nova precisa de uma receita dessas pra ficar com o sensorial acima da m√©dia? 

Eu eventualmente testo caf√©s com torra relativamente nova nessa receita pra testar o sensorial usando  a t√©cnica do bypass e simplesmente  precisa diluir em quase 240ml de √°gua pra legal(o dobro do indicado pra graos velhos).

Ainda vou fazer mais uns testes, mas aparentemente eu recebi um caf√© bem meme. Veja bem, ele at√© entrega algum sensorial na x√≠cara se voc√™ der uma for√ßada, mas concordam que √© estranho pra caramba um caf√© com 9d de torra n dar crosta no cupping, n demonstrar notal sensorial alguma no cupping exceto o cheiro/gosto do cheiro de caf√© descafeinado e precisar de receitas criativas pra ficar acima da m√©dia? 

Eu estou aberto a sugest√µes de como testar os graos, inclusive vou congelar umas 40g de kd p comparar no curso de degusta√ß√£o que farei na academia do cafe.

¬π Os meus cafes do hyuga est√£o com data de torra 06/01, ficando 7d descansando(tempo de entrega + bancada aqui em casa) e congelados no dia 13/01. Foram descongelados dia 24/01 e devido a isso contam apenas 15d da data de torra, pois esse foi o tempo que o caf√© ficou armazenado em temperatura ambiente. 

Como eu sei que alguns colegas do grupo junto comigo tiveram problemas com gosto de queimado nos Heirloom do hyuga, vou relatar brevemente o sensorial que me entregaram no cupping de hoje.


74158 - formou uma crosta bem espessa e o arom√°tico estava t√≠mido. No paladar, a nota de ma√ß√£ com uma leve acidez e sem o gosto de super extra√≠do/ queimado / amargo.

Heirloom - Crosta espessa, arom√°tico, notas evidentes e claras. Pra mim j√° deve sair bom, assim que preparar no b75/v60 posto aqui.",2,1738468343.0,cafebrasil,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been depressed a long time, probably for over half of my life at this point from severe trauma in my childhood. I‚Äôve grown up, kinda flamed out, and I‚Äôm not so much sad as just‚Ä¶bored with life.

Like, I realized how futile suicide and self harm truly are, but I‚Äôve also realized how futile a lot of daily life seems to be. My entire life I‚Äôve never drank, never smoked, never used drugs. Not for any moral standpoint but purely because I never really liked the taste. Alcohol doesn‚Äôt taste as good as water, tea, or coffee. Cigarettes are expensive, and vape juice kinda just tastes‚Ä¶mediocre. Weed was only kinda fun with friends, and even then, it wasn‚Äôt too fun to begin with.

I made it a point to try them all though, just because I wanted to understand the people that did them. But none of the habits could ever stick.

For two years I‚Äôve been in a blind rut. Day in, day out, I do absolutely nothing. No work, no school, no job of any kind. I have no purpose, no friends, no excitement, no hardship, no motivation, no will.

And then, out of the blue last night, I had a dream. And when I woke up, the only thing on my mind was, ‚ÄúGod, I really should just start smoking again.‚Äù

And I thought about it, because obviously I know the evidence behind why it‚Äôs bad (I‚Äôve researched it extensively). And I‚Äôve never felt the urge to do anything like that before. But when I really, truly thought about it‚Ä¶I honestly couldn‚Äôt think of a reason why I shouldn‚Äôt. And now I realize that there‚Äôs a lot of things that make me feel that way.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I start driving faster?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I start drinking more?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I go hookup with random strangers?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I do drugs again?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I go out and party?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I get into physical fights with people just for the thrill of it?‚Äù

Idk maybe I just lack meaning in my life. But I think I understand how people get addicted to things like meth or heroine now.

1ifoeym,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1ifoeym/itinerary_review_please/,itinerary review please,"Hi! A friend and I are heading to Costa Rica for 8 days for the first time. And I would very much appreciate counsel!

A couple of questions:

1. What are your overall thoughts to our itinerary?
2. Haven't booked any tours, but would love to: zipline, white water raft, bird watch for my novice self, a night tour, coffee (if time). Where would you recommend ziplining, or honestly any of the tours?
3. For our last day and a half, kind of wanted to check out the Nicoya Peninsula to get close to the Blue zones. Tamarindo? Nosara? Tambor? Cobano? Or should I modify this trip and add a day to either La Fortuna, Monteverde, or Manuel Antonio instead?

Thanks in advanceeee!

I have a channel that is currently sitting around 275k subscribers.   
I took a long break from posting consistently, and am stuck in a lovely and crappy place known as overthinking land, in the country of ""where do I go next""?   
The videos that took off were little shorts where I play a barman and all of his regulars.   
But the thing is, I never wanted the content to be about drinking. It was meant to be satire, and a fun way to poke at an industry that tends to take itself WAYYY to seriously.   
  
My question is this:   
Pre-covid I was a full-time magician & mind-reader. I pivoted in 2020, bought a fourplex and started running 3 airbnbs form it. I stopped performing live shows as frequently. Come 2021 I focused on YT and TT. Both grew really quickly, and I stuck in the lane of the bar skits content.   
  
The views are primarily on shorts, and anytime I post a skit that is longform, it doesn't do nearly as well in terms of views as I'd hope.   
  
I'm dedicated to going back to doing YT full time again, and hope to inspire an audience of primarily young men, to challenge their stories, grow to be better all under an umbrella of comedy and magical elements woven throughout, against the backdrop of ""the bar"".   
  
Can the community here come together and help me with an actionable plan, so I can GTFO of my head, and start posting again, so that I can inspire others, help people to laugh and smile more, and remember not to take any of this so seriously?   
  
What is my channel going into 2025? What are my content buckets? What is my value prop? How can I leverage my various talents and writing chops to create a massive community with engaged hearts (not just eyeballs)? Can you help me include my love for travel & adventure somewhere, so that I can eventually lean into companies to sponsor my trip to XYZ, to either bartend, perform magic, or whatever? 

Thanks in advance,   
Sorry if this came off like a pile of unmedicated neuro-spicy overwhelm, I'm 2 coffees and half a snickers into my evening...Buckled in for the ride.

I've slept perfectly my entire life before having a child. Could sleep whenever whatever all night through. 

My daughter is a horrible sleeper even at 1.5 years old now. however, my husband takes over at night just to help me get an opportunity to sleep because I had her ina foreign country with no help and I slept maybe 1-2 hours a night for months and I have like PTSD regarding sleep now as silly as that sounds. After he took over I began sleeping about 6ish hours at least although I'd like 7-8.

Flash forward to now and my life is hell. I stopped breatfeeding about a month ago and I got a long period, lots of chin acne, and now horrible insomnia. I wake after 2-3 hours of light sleep and my heart is racing like I drank 5 coffees and I can't sleep no matter what meditation, drink, relaxing, getting up, yoga, whatever. I do yoga in the day and get out and don't drink caffeine and I can typically fall asleep (who knows now though...) but I'm waking after a couple hours as if I'm running. I know it seems liek anxiety and this situation makes me anxious sure, but I know this is chemical or physical because I can literally feel my body freaking out. 

I tried melatonin and it actually is around when this started. I actually wish I never took it because I feel like it made everything way worse. When I took it I would wake earlier and earlier each time so I quit taking it and now I'm still stuck after a week waking up early as hell. I tried a valerian sleep thing and like melatonin it seemed to help one night and the. I feel worse. I want to detox my body from all this and not take anything because I think the supplements actually harmed my slee a lot. However, I'm so scarred this is my life forever now. I got a chickenpox vaccine booster (I was low titer and it's at daycare) and that's literally the only other weird thing. Weaning, that, I was sick with the flu and hand foot mouth last month, and supplements. I don't know what to do and I'm starting to become severely depressed over it. 

Anyone know anything about these factors and can it get better? 

I see a doctor Monday but most doctors just disregard everything as anxiety so I don't have much hope. I live in small town in France and finding a doctor at ALL even in surrounding cities is almost impossible (they don't answer the phone or email and just say no new patients) so she's my only choice.

I was lucky enough to go through this cycle of self-inflicted violence from August until November 26th, and then stopped completely. However, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm currently struggling with:

1. I‚Äôm aware of the amazing effects sobriety has brought me, especially now that I‚Äôve hit the 60 day mark, but there was always one thing on my ‚Äòalcohol bucket list‚Äô (I guess) that I never got to try- coffee and alcohol. Like a properly made cocktail or whatever with both. 

Obviously, here are my mental road blocks:
A. I have an addictive personality, and am currently struggling with other substances right now anyway. 

B. Officially at day 73! I was lucky enough to learn I needed to manipulate myself into doing something so reprehensible while drunk that my own moral code would feel it, stopping my urges and craving altogether. 

C. Once in a while I get alcohol related dreams, and I almost drink but then stop (I was a heavy binge drinker), so that‚Äôs no fun/scary,  sometimes but I know it‚Äôs not unusual. Same thing with sweets/chocolate cravings. I got one of those dreams this week, after contemplating my coffee/alcohol idea. 

D. I can‚Äôt tell if my coffee alcohol idea is backed by what motive of mine, hence my question. This feels like an exam where it says pick the BEST answer, but all the choices are checkboxes. Anyway, here are the potential motivations I‚Äôve thought up so far, so if there‚Äôs any feedback from y‚Äôall, I‚Äôd love it! 


- malevolent subconscious addiction creeping up, and I need to proactively and COMPLETELY shut it down if I want to maintain sobriety

- one drink wouldn‚Äôt hurt, and it‚Äôs a combo I‚Äôve always wanted. Culture/religion take effect here too, in almost always surrounded by non drinkers

- the beginning of a slippery slope path that leads back to binge drinking

- but I‚Äôm 21, and if I really am committing to a life of never trying coffee and alcohol, that‚Äôs something I need to accept now so I don‚Äôt have this argument with myself in the future 

These are the current intent ideas I have, and yes I know it may seem trivial given that this is literally something as dumb as coffee and alcohol, but I would still be incredibly appreciative of anyone‚Äôs comments/feedback/opinions!

	‚Ä¢	Finding the right lighting (especially in early morning conditions)
	‚Ä¢	Composing shots that feel natural and balanced
	‚Ä¢	Editing techniques that enhance the image without overdoing it

Lately, my mom wants to do everything with me. For context, she works a desk job at home every day except Monday. I work an active (physically and mentally) job and do not work at home any days. 

When the weekend rolls around, she wants to do things. I do not want to do anything. I'm exhausted. I'm an extreme introvert working an extroverted job and all I want to do is recover in my house, read, catch up on writing, drink coffee, nap, and watch TV with the dog. 

She gets really upset that I don't do anything with her. But we literally live together. We do everything together. Here's a list of things we do together every week just at home:  
‚Ä¢ In the morning, first thing I do before work is say hello to her in her office. We chat and I'm sometimes a few minutes late leaving for work.  
‚Ä¢ Most days we send a few texts during work. Some none at all. I don't really have time to text.  
‚Ä¢ When I come home, the first thing I do is say hello again. We'll chat for another few minutes and I usually go decompress in my room or on the couch.  
‚Ä¢ We eat dinner together every single night  
‚Ä¢ We watch TV together after dinner every single night  
‚Ä¢ We go to bed at the same time and say goodnight together every single night  
‚Ä¢ On the weekends, in the morning, we drink coffee and talk together
‚Ä¢ We clean the house together on Sunday 


I don't have many friends in the area anymore so maybe once every other month I go meet someone for dinner on a weeknight, like seriously mild stuff. I also stay over until late at work a few times a year. So it's not like I'm going out all the time and she rarely sees me or talks to me. 

I prefer to do my shopping directly after work, and schedule a pick up if I can (except the grocery store), so that's when I prefer to get things done. Not on the weekend. Walking and looking around Target is *not* something I like to do. 

Am I being an asshole? I am posting this here because we're all around the same age. If I was on my own, I think this would be vastly different. But right now I wish more than ever I had my own apartment/space. 

**Edit: I just want to add, I love my mom.** I'm very grateful I can spend time with her. I love eating dinner and watching TV with her and chatting with her all the time. But I'm also an adult with my own preferences and likes/dislikes.",18,1738466070.0,Zillennials,11,0.95,False

However, I have the best intentions to take 1-2 days off a week to try reset and give everything a break. I find that half way through these days I've intended to take off that I feel like taking my medication.

Almost similar feels as if you were wanting coffee but were trying to stop caffine. 

It's not because I have significant amount of stuff to get done of these days off however the biggest consideration for me is simply how the meds make my mood better so on off days I'm feeling quite flat. 

I know you have to way up the balance of choosing to take a day off with all the side effects such as anxiety, depression etc OR just be okay with not taking a break for a period of time. 

I think there's a sense of feeling bad for relying on my medication even though I probably shouldn't. 

Not asking for medical advice however just wanted to put the feels out there for see what others thoughts were. 

Perhaps there is a sense of having withdraws on days off!?

1ifnuhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ifnuhf/let_me_32f_tell_you_what_an_age_gap_relationship/,Let me (32F) tell you what an age gap relationship (47M) is really like.,"We met at work and worked very closely together. Both single, no kids, never married. We have been dating for 2 years and met when I was 28 and he was 43. 

Here are some great things that I attribute to his age: 

* They aren't trying to decide what they want. Their vision of wife and kids (or whatever it is they want) is clear.
* Taking the initiative to plan dates.
* You won't catch them trying to split the bill.
* Smarter.
* Stable in their careers. Have actual skills.
* Better problem solving.
* Not trying to deceive or play games.
* More comfortable as a leader, not looking for ""mommy.""

Here are some challenges that I've had in this relationship that I didn't anticipate: 

* Severe anxiety about ""forever."" The idea of growing old together no longer lives in reality, and I'm concerned about **being alone when I'm old.**
* All men objectify women, but I truly believe this gets worse as they age and not better. Younger men are out meeting women, dating, getting laid. **Older men are in their homes with their phones and a pipe dream.** We can't get through one -ONE- episode of Love Is Blind without him commenting on how hot the women are.
* Younger will always be better no matter how young you are. Older men put a premium on youth, and it's hard to believe that there is a difference between 28 and 25 to them, but believe me, there is. There is no consideration of their age. **They all believe they are 25** on the inside and out. 
* Less flexible and open-minded. They have a particular type of woman/life/lifestyle that they have adopted/dreamt about and they have a hard time deviating from that.
* It's extremely difficult to socialize with his family and friends. Everyone views me as a child, and I feel like I'll never really fit in. His brother constantly asks me if I have to use the bathroom when we are out like I haven't been pissing for 32 years. I have a successful career, home, etc. But they really **can't ever fully respect you as a person**.
* No matter how beautiful you are, no matter how astronomically you are out of his league, **it isn't enough.** Your presence just emboldens them. 

But by far, the **most significant unanticipated challenge** is the way that everything is blamed on the age gap. His close ex suggested we model our wedding menu after a meal they had in Italy? Totally cool because they've been ""just friends"" for 10 years long now. Friend who made fun of me to my face because of the part of the country I was born in? Oh that's just his ol pal who has been like that for ages. Difficult to live with? Oh that's just because he has lived alone for so long. Can't stop commenting on hot women in public? It's just been so long since he has been in a relationship, he can't help it. It just becomes so hard to discern serious issues from small challenges. 

Anyway, if you're a woman in her 40s laughing at my post, I get it. If you're a woman in her 20s, my message to you is: it can be a bit of fun, and I know how hard it is to date the coffee-date, loser men out there, but long-term, it might be worth sifting through the garbage out there to find someone within 5 years of you.

TL;DR Age gap relationships can have a lot of love, but are ripe for gaslighting. ",7,1738465961.0,relationships,30,0.57,False

For context I‚Äôve been with my partner since September, so This is our first winter together. I‚Äôm a first responder and I work night shifts. I‚Äôve always struggled with seasonal depression and I was recently diagnosed with Anemia. I dread the winter months because All of these factors combined cause me to be excessively fatigued and sluggish. This time of year is significantly hard on me physically and mentally. I did warn him about this beforehand but I think he underestimated how much it would actually affect me. 

He‚Äôs been getting frustrated about me falling asleep and being sluggish when we hang out. He says that it‚Äôs disheartening that he only sees me 1-2 times a week and when he does see me, I‚Äôm falling asleep. I also don‚Äôt drive at the moment so he typically picks me up (sometimes I‚Äôll uber to him if I can afford it). So I see the frustration. I‚Äôm not sleeping the entire time- but I will doze off if we‚Äôre watching TV.  I try to reassure him that it‚Äôs nothing personal, I physically can‚Äôt help it and I‚Äôm trying my best. I‚Äôve been taking my iron pills, I‚Äôll try to get coffee before we hang out, etc. But it‚Äôs still difficult. 

It‚Äôs beginning to cause tension in our relationship because he feels like he‚Äôs doing most of the heavy lifting and not getting much in return. His frustration then in turn puts me in a bad mood. I do see where he‚Äôs coming from but I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I feel bad enough because of what I‚Äôm going through in the first place, and now I feel even worse because of how he‚Äôs reacting to it. It‚Äôs creating this really helpless feeling‚Ä¶..I‚Äôve never had someone upset at me for something I couldn‚Äôt control.

For the tank, I'm hoping to go no-tech but if that doesn't work after observation then I'd go low-tech.

‚Ä¢ I'm living in warm climate so no need for heater.

‚Ä¢ Specially so since the tank will be placed in a roofed balcony where it will get plenty of morning and late afternoon sun. So no need for additional lighting either.

‚Ä¢ Oxygen..... I forgot to consider this. I have moss and lots of plants, will they be enough? Or should I get an o2 pump? or do I need co2 instead?

‚Ä¢ I don't think I'd be needing filter either since I'll be partial-changing the water weekly to water my plant pots. + I want to get snails and shrimps.

For tank friends, this is where I'm really lost. Idk how much population a 3gal can hold but I'm hoping to get a pair of nerite snails, 1or2 pairs of neocardina shrimps, and idk what fish to have. I'll be caring for the tank but I'm mainly setting it up for my mom and she likes looking at eye-catching fishes like goldfish and betta. But I read that goldfish tends to wreck planted set ups and bettas are aggressive fish friends. Any recos what pretty fish would be appropriate for my tank?

edit: I thought its a 3 gal and sad I couldnt put fish then I realised I never really measured it nor filled it to the top so I went and it's a 16x8x10in and if I'm not wrong from lack of coffee then it's a 6gal, and partially filled, 5gal right? RIGHT?! please be right I want fish.

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ifn9pg,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1ifn9pg/first_time_buyer_i_could_use_some_help/,First time buyer ... I could use some help!,"Hello,

Thank you for reading my post! I currently drink my coffee from a Philips Senseo coffee pad machine. I have been doing this for many years, but now I am starting to get bored by the watery taste. I am looking forward to a better coffee experience and decided to go look for a bean machine. And this is where my journey starts.

I quickly noticed there are uncountable coffee machines, so I am trying to narrow down my choices. But now I am stuck and could really use some help and advice. Let's get started.

**Current situation**

I use a Philips Senseo pad machine for my coffee. For my cups of tea I use a Philps water cooker. Where both machines are positioned, I only have 2 power sockets available. Both machines use 1 power socket each.

**Which beverages**

With my new machine (yet to buy) I would like to be able to make the same cup size of coffee as my Philips Senseo does (can you tell me if that is called Americano, Lungo or something else?) and occasionally it would be nice if I could drink a cappuccino. I don't need any other milk drink or exotic coffee formats. Just a simple cup of coffee like my Senseo but made from beans, and occasionally a cappuccino.

Since I have only 2 power sockets available to make my coffee, tea and occasional cappuccino, I have these 3 options:

\- the new machine makes all the beverages: coffee, tea, cappuccino (1 power socket)  
\- the new machine makes coffee and tea, and besides I use a separate milk frother (2 power sockets)  
\- the new machine makes coffee and cappuccino, and besides I use a separate water cooker for tea (2 power sockets)

**Preferences**

There are 3 preferences I have. The process of making a cup of coffee should be as easy and fast as possible. Cleaning should take as less time as possible. This is why I am not sure if I should buy a machine with milk options, since these machines require more cleaning as I understand correctly.

My last preference is that I prefer not to buy a machine that requires a new expensive water filter every other month. I am not sure though if this is a realistic preference. Perhaps every machine needs a water filter that needs to be replaced every other month? Maybe someone can explain this?

**Maintenance versus price**

I am struggling with the following. Should I better buy an expensive machine that in case of failure must be repaired at high costs, or should I buy a cheaper machine that I can throw away in case it fails after a few years. I think I like the last option better.

An example: I could buy a Jura form $ 800 and if it fails (outside warranty period) have it repaired for about $ 300. Or I could buy a machine between $ 400 and $ 500 and just buy a new one in case it fails (outside warranty period). Any thoughts on this?

**What would you advice?**

So now that you have some idea of what I am looking for, I hope you can give me some advice.

I have been told that De'Longhi makes good quality machines. Based on my input, could you advice me a specific De'Longhi machine? The thing I am most worried about is the milk cleaning part. I do not like cleaning parts and small tubes. But as far as I have seen, all De'Longhi machines seem to have milk options and there are no models without milk options. So if I would go for a De'Longhi machine, which one would be the easiest to clean and maintain?

Then there is the Siemens and Bosch machines. I noticed some of their machines, like [Siemens EQ300](https://www.siemens-home.bsh-group.com/uk/en/product/coffee-machine/automated-freestanding/eq3-fully-automatic-bean-to-cup-coffee-machine/TF301G19), have a simple steaming pipe you can pull down to make a cappuccino. In the videos it seems quite easy, like even a total noob like me could do it. Also it seems quite easy to clean. What are your thoughts about these machines? Are they any good?

If you are still reading, thank you very much!!! I hope you can give me some useful advice. Although I mentioned De'Longhi and Siemens/Bosch as possible options, I am open to any other suggestion. I am a total noob on this matter and any advice is very welcome. Hopefully with your input I will soon be able to enjoy a nice cup of coffee! :-)",0,1738464042.0,superautomatic,5,0.5,False
1ifn9he,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ifn9he,Practically new machine is disgusting inside after just a few uses [Mr. Coffee Steam Espresso],"I'll start by saying I know very little about espresso machines. I've used the automatic ones in coffee shops but not much else I got a Mr. Coffee espresso machine with steam wand for Christmas. I know it's significantly simpler than what the folks on this sub tend to use, but it's what I was gifted so I wanted to make it work. 

I used it maybe 4-5 times and noticed a burning smell. Tried running hot water through the steam wand and it only got worse. After looking inside I noticed some sort of buildup, and every time I run anything through it, theres bits of something in the water. 

The only thing that should've gotten in this reservoir is water but I'm wondering if milk somehow got in as well. I've tried a water/vinegar mixture, a coffee pot cleaner to remove lime buildup, and even an industrial coffee pot cleaner. It's still full of gunk. I can't get into the reservoir to actually clean it. 

I'm about ready to consider it a lost cause but would love to be able to use it since it was gifted to me. It's practically new. Photos attached of the machine, the inside, and the buildup I've gotten out of it through repeatedly cleaning. 

If it is a lot cause, any recommendations for a budget-friendly espresso machine with steam wand? I loved having this thing functional for the few days it wasn't nasty",0,1738464020.0,espresso,3,0.5,False

Do you *have* to add milk to that? 

*Well, I could just add water and make an Americano.*

That sounds good. [Why wasn't that your first inclination?]

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Creating a home decor aesthetic kitchen is a delightful endeavor, blending functionality with style to transform one of the most important spaces in your home. A well-curated kitchen not only enhances your cooking experience but also reflects your personal taste. Let's delve into the secrets of achieving an aesthetic that resonates with warmth, elegance, and modern charm.

Key elements to consider when designing your home decor aesthetic kitchen include:

- **Color Palette:** Opt for soft hues like sage green, muted pastels, or classic whites that evoke a serene atmosphere. Accents of richer colors can be introduced through accessories to create a vibrant contrast.
- **Natural Materials:** Incorporating natural wood, stone countertops, and metal fixtures adds a rustic touch. These materials enhance the visual appeal and durability of your kitchen, making it both stylish and practical.
- **Open Shelving:** Ditching the traditional cabinets for open shelving can create a sense of space and accessibility. Use this opportunity to display aesthetically pleasing dishware, plants, or cookbooks, showcasing your personality.
- **Lighting:** Invest in statement pendant lights or under-cabinet lighting to create a warm ambiance. Layered lighting allows for both tasks and mood, ensuring that your kitchen remains inviting throughout the day.
- **Functional Decor:** Decorate with items that serve a purpose. Consider stylish canisters for storage, decorative cutting boards, or vintage utensils that add charm while keeping your kitchen organized.

To truly embody the home decor aesthetic kitchen, pay attention to details and choose pieces that evoke a cohesive theme. Infusing your personality into the design will make your kitchen a space where you enjoy spending time, whether cooking, entertaining, or simply enjoying a coffee break.

Embrace the intersection of utility and aesthetics in your kitchen decor, and watch as it becomes the heart of your home!

**--**

I've been in the BDSM community for over 20 years, starting out as a sub. Learned a lot over the years, so I do understand both sides of the dynamic. Because of my background, I'm more of a FemDomme, with a side order of Findomme, meaning money isn't a huge issue for me. Little sends make me happy too.

I am more of the Mommy Domme type, definitely not into humiliation, but can accommodate small amounts of it when necessary. I like to have normal chats about all sorts of things: the paranormal, movies, WWE, politics and so on. In other words, real things not just kink. 

I am faceless, until such time as my sub deserves to see my face.

I accept only via Throne (link in my bio).

If any of this interests you, feel free to send a DM stating your intention. Tribute will be expected once a dynamic is established. Chatting for more than 5 minutes will require a 'coffee' send at minimum.

Best,

Today was the big day: the ski train to winter park. I live in Golden, so the train is kind of dumb for me. It doesn‚Äôt matter though because it‚Äôs the coolest thing ever. We started the day by driving to federal center to get on the first W line of the day at 5:57. Highway 6 west was already looking pretty heavy going to merge onto I-70, so I was feeling great that I wasn‚Äôt headed for I-70. If you need to drive to Union, you‚Äôll probably be best paying for a garage to park for the day. Amtrak has a list of garages in the area here: https://www.amtrak.com/stations/den.html
I would recommend the light rail if it makes sense for you though. The light rail cost $2.75 or free if you have an EcoPass through work like I do. The light rail actually arrived at 6:04 and got to Union station at 6:35 or so. It‚Äôs a five minute walk to the ski train from there. The ski train leaves from the main area of Union, track 5 on the day I went. There‚Äôs lots of Amtrak employees and volunteers helping direct people onto the train and getting skis loaded. Thanks to the train nerd volunteers! Information about that: https://winterparkexpress.org/recruiting.html They have ski racks that look very much like those at ski resorts. It seems to me that skis without a bag is the easiest move if you are going for a day trip. Bringing your boots on with you and suiting up in Moffat Tunnel is the easiest. You can leave stuff at your seat for the day. The Amtrak folks are clearly working really hard to give people a good experience and make this train happen. In particular, the conductor Antonio is clearly working his ass off for a good experience and on time departure. 

On to the train. Y‚Äôall, I‚Äôve lived in Germany for about a year and a half and traveled a lot by train in Europe. This train is significantly nicer than even first class in Europe. Big spacious seats that recline a lot with a foot rest. All seats have outlets. The lounge car has got snacks, coffee, and alcohol for purchase and has gigantic overhead windows. The train was sold out (405 people!!), but there was a fancy ass seat for everyone. It was scheduled to leave at 7, and it left at 7 sharp. I paid $60 a person round trip. That‚Äôs obviously steeper than the Snowstang, but seeing how nice this train is, no complaints from me. This was really a luxury experience. 

The train goes north from Union station then turns west to pass through Arvada. As a resident of the west suburbs, I was hoping that they could add another stop in Arvada. Seeing how much effort it is to herd a bunch of people holding long sticks that are not used to riding trains onto the train, I now worry that a second stop may be difficult. Maybe they can get creative, like loading people into waiting cars and attaching those cars to the train in Arvada. As full as this one is, maybe we aren‚Äôt so far off from supporting a second train from Arvada. The volunteers came through with a brochure about the route, so I‚Äôve attached a photo of that to describe the rest of the route. Around the mouth of Coal Creek Canyon, we saw approximately 7 billion elk. The train arrived at Winter Park at 8:40, 30 minutes before scheduled. 

You meet some characters on public transit, and this time, I had a chat with quite the character. There was a teenager who was headed to winter park to skin up to Pano. He said he was talking the train instead of driving because he lost his license because of a DUI a few weeks back coming home from Loveland. I asked him why he didn‚Äôt just take the Snowstang to Loveland if he has a pass there, but he said his dad confiscated his pass because of that incident. He claimed that it all went down because someone hot boxed his car in the Loveland parking lot, but I don‚Äôt know if I believe it. His red ski bag absolutely reeked of marijuana when it got unpacked from under the train. To each their own I guess. 

The train rolled back into the Winter Park station around 4:15 to load back up. We were scheduled to go at 4:35, but had a 20 minute delay getting going because of a computer issue. The view down into Denver is really cool in the dark with all the city lights. We had to stop for a freight train to pass just before crossing Hwy 93. About a mile from Union station, the train stopped and then started going backwards. I think they briefly had us stopped in a train yard, presumably to let something else pass. We then backed into Union station to arrive at 7:10 (scheduled 7:05)

I will totally take the train again. Super unique and fun experience.

""Strong Language

My friend James and I decided to never re-tell the events of this hunting trip but I felt it necessary to tell people in order to move on. I have spoken with him and he reluctantly agreed that it wouldn‚Äôt hurt, I am going to be heavy on the detail in case any of you guys pick something up just know I changed our names but no one else‚Äôs.

I had recently quit my job and started doing a course, I was sick of my job at the time and wanted to study and get a proper formal qualification as I never went to university and kicked myself for it. My friend James is a small business owner that is somewhat seasonal so he had time during the winter. I was on a break from the private college who shut down twice a year so we decided that since neither of us had shot a deer that year and we would try to fill our freezer with venison in our downtime.

We had both just recently received our ‚ÄúR License‚Äù which allows us to hunt in State Forests in NSW, Australia, these forests usually have some kind of pine plantation on them, they are used by the government owned forestry corporation and there are hundreds in my state of NSW, Australia covering millions of acres. The forest we had chose was Mt David State Forest is located on the other side of the Blue Mountains and is about 16,615 acres. We had chose this massive expanse of land as I had heard good things from several friends about it and it reportedly had wild pigs and fallow deer on it.

So the trip was planned and on a frosty Friday morning in July (southern hemisphere remember) we set off for what was supposed to be a four day hunt.

The drive was great we spent the few hour trip talking about life, previous hunting trips etc. When we got near where we were supposed to be mobile reception dropped out which was of no surprise, most places you go hunting has zero reception.

It was about 11am at this time, the trip was slow due to my mate‚Äôs incredibly large addiction to coffee and his seemingly miniscule bladder, I think we stopped three times.

We had been driving on dirt roads for a few kilometers now and we were starting to come up to some pine plantations but we weren‚Äôt sure where to turn in so we kept following what we thought was the entry road. It was here the first weird thing happened, we rounded a bend in the road to reveal a man sitting in a ute (Pickup truck for our American friends) with a huge dog on the back. It was strange, we hadn‚Äôt passed a vehicle in miles and yet here this guy was drinking a can of beer at 11 something in the morning. It was as if he was waiting for something or someone. I mean why would you just be sitting there on a dirt road in the middle of the day doing nothing?
We slowly rolled alongside him, said G‚Äôday and asked him where the entry to the forest was, he was approximately in his 60‚Äôs and had a big full grey beard, he had all of his teeth and a dark blue jumper which us Aussies would call a Sloppy Joe and blue jeans. He started telling us that there had been deer around and blah blah just general stuff you talk to strangers about when in the country whilst he sipped away on his beer. Eventually after ten minutes of talking he offered to show us the entry to the forest. As we were following him James mentioned how strange it was to be in the middle of nowhere and to come across a man just parked on the road and that he was almost overly keen to help, but I pointed out we were in the country and people are generally more helpful and friendly.

Once we got into the forest the man pulled over and I again pulled alongside him and at this point we kind of did introductions he said his name was Slim, I said I was Kevin and introduced my mate James. At this point he offered to show us around the forest and where we could possibly camp. I said thanks but we‚Äôd be fine but he insisted so I felt obliged to do so just to entertain him.

Whilst following him around the pine plantations made day turn to dusk it is really dark amongst 20-30m high pine trees and gives it an eery feeling. James pipes up and goes: ‚ÄúThere is no fucking way we are camping where he suggested, we don‚Äôt know who he is, we have all our gear here, he could want to know where we‚Äôd camp so he could come back and steal our stuff!‚Äù

I somewhat agreed but in that moment I felt he was just an old bored bloke that was happy to see some new faces.

During the half hour or so drive Slim would stop and tell us the good camp sites. Finally he shows us a big open clearing and says that is where most people camp. By the time he was done with the tour we wanted to get set up but had agreed to not camp where he said in fear of getting our gear knocked off. So we thanked him profusely and that is when the first instance we got that our instincts may be right when just about as he was getting back in his car he pauses and asks: ‚ÄúSo where do you think you blokes will camp?‚Äù I shut up not knowing what to say when James goes: ‚ÄúMate, we‚Äôre not sure yet we will probably have a drive around some more and worry about that later on today, it won‚Äôt take us long to set up once we‚Äôve gone for more of a look around.‚Äù ‚ÄúI really think you blokes should camp in the clearing, that is where every other mongrel camps‚Äù Slim said authoritatively.

Slim kind of got a bit agitated at this point and narrowed his eyes towards James staring him in the eyes. ‚ÄúWell you bloody well better hurry up and decide, it gets mighty dark and cold mighty quick in this forest so you pair will want to get nice and bloody warm.‚Äù Slim barked. James thanked him for his concern and we hopped back in the car and waited until he drove off.

James sat in the car and whispered: ‚ÄúWhat the fuck man?‚Äù I looked and shrugged not knowing what to say but feeling far less comfortable than I did 45 seconds before.

Once we were certain Slim was gone we started looking for a concealed camping spot, somewhere out of the way and a place he didn‚Äôt show us. After what seemed like forever driving up and down these forestry roads and scratching the shit out of my year old 4wd on blackberry and other shrubs we found this little track that went into the forest about 50m and then there was a clearing. The best part was that we couldn‚Äôt be seen from any road and we were happy with that.

So we set up camp, James had his dome swag and tarp, I had a new dome tent that I had never set up before so it took a bit to get going and in the tent I had my flat swag as bedding but at the end of it I was looking and thinking how cool the camp looked and snapped a photo on my phone of the camp which would later save our asses from spending a night out in sub zero temps with just out hunting gear.

With camp set up we looked at the maps I had downloaded on my phone to see where the no/hunting zones were and where best to hunt, we decided our course of action, loaded our rifles and walked away from camp.

After a good scout about we saw next to nothing other than a feral sheep that had gotten itself caught up in some blackberries which we freed and it ran off into the edge of the pine plantation. We decided to make our way back to camp whilst we still had daylight left.

We headed back in the direction we confidently thought camp was and when we got to where we thought it should be we couldn‚Äôt find it. No worries we will do a lap around we must have missed the track we said. We walked and looked and walked for 3 hours, luckily we had head lamps as this made life easier, well ok we were still lost but it was comforting to have light. After a while we switched down to one headlamp so we didn‚Äôt run the batteries out of them both. At this point James had the shits because I should have marked a waypoint to camp on my phone‚Äôs GPS software. I had franticly been looking at my phone trying to find phone reception so I could get some google earth images to work out where we were in relation to the clearing we picked but no luck. It was then it struck me that I had taken a picture of camp and it should have GPS info in the meta-data. Luckily for us the app we were required to use, PDF Maps had an image import feature that I found and this gave us our waypoint back to camp and so we went.

We arrived back got the fire started and James opens the Captain Morgan spiced rum which over the course of the night we had pretty much drank the bottle due to James‚Äôs liberal servings. (I‚Äôll point out that at this point all of our hunting gear was locked in the car with ammunition locked in a separate container per NSW firearms laws)

We decided that it was time to go to bed at around 11:30pm as we needed to be up around 5:30am to be hunting before first light. That is when I noticed something odd, My swag was all set up, I could have sworn I had placed the sleeping bag under the canvas flap of the swag but there was my sleeping bag rolled up in its own bag on one side of the tent. I put this down to my imagining of setting my bed up properly and more than a few drinks so I drunkenly set it up and went to bed.

5:25am my alarm goes off echoing in my hungover head, I hate mornings, I get up, my head hurts and I dry reach from tiredness and too much drink from the evening before. Our plan was to get up, go for a hunt and come back light the fire and cook brekky so we get set and head off on our hunt, we had scouted this area and walked there before light so we could be in place as we thought the deer may be feeding in this area but when we got there we could hear the drone of a diesel engine just puttering away, we couldn‚Äôt see it but it sounded close so that was that hunt screwed up and we went and tried another spot. We get to this spot and now it is about 6:15am and we see nothing yet we hear the diesel puttering away and seemingly as close as it was before even though we could barely hear it when we first go there. This didn‚Äôt strike us as unsual it was a Saturday morning and there was bound to be other hunters out there but aside from Slim and the sound of the diesel we had seen no trace of anybody.

We call it quits and go back to camp for breakfast, this is when things take a turn for the strange. We get back to camp and the fire was raging, stacked with wood that was burning hot and strong as if it had been going for a while this was really weird, we didn‚Äôt light it, the fire went out throughout the night, it was not burning in the morning, it didn‚Äôt even have any warm embers as we had limited firewood and were conservative with how much we burnt so it was just about out before we went to bed the night before.

James and I looked at each other we couldn‚Äôt explain it, we hadn‚Äôt even stacked wood on the fire in anticipation for when we got back, we are never that organised. At this point I remembered my sleeping bag being rolled up and ran to my tent, unzipped it and not only was the sleeping bag rolled up again my swag had been flipped around so the open end, where you place a pillow is facing the front of the tent and not the back. I DID NOT DO THIS. I called James to come check it out and I called again he eventually answered: ‚ÄúAhh Kevin, y.y.you might want to come check this out‚Äù he kind of whimpered. I stood up, zipped my tent and walked over to the front of the car where James was looking at the still frosty windscreen of my 4wd, where I noticed someone had written something into the frost:

‚ÄúSTAY WARM BUT DON‚ÄôT BURN‚Äù

At this point I went off: ‚ÄúJAMES YOU PRICK! Don‚Äôt fuck about like that after this shit happened with the fire and my swag.‚Äù But I knew he didn‚Äôt write it, he was too shocked, he can‚Äôt go this long without laughing if he was messing about. I think I just wanted it to be a joke but the look on his face said he was not joking and as time went on it would be proven he wasn‚Äôt joking.

After my outburst, James he turned to me and just screamed in my face not like a girly scream but a massive guttural scream that came from deep down in his chest he screamed for what seemed like a minute but I was sure it was only a few seconds, I jumped back‚Ä¶ it scared the shit out of me. At this point he threw down his backpack and stormed off into dark pine plantation next to us.

I was pretty freaked out, I‚Äôve known James for 10 years or more and he has never behaved erratically like this in the past. I didn‚Äôt follow him though, maybe I should have. I just felt he needed a moment and it was probably the shock of what had happened at camp combined with the stresses of home life and business.

I was going to start packing up camp as to me there was no way we were staying, someone had found us and was fucking with us big time and who knows how far they would take it.

It was then I looked into the flames and they grabbed 100% of my attention. There was nothing extraordinary about the fire but I walked closer feeling the warmth on my skin; not that I was cold anymore as adrenaline was still surging through my body with the events that had just transpired but I was fixated into the flames. I just sat down by the fire and watched the flames.

I put it down to a bit of shock but I didn‚Äôt feel I was frozen in fear I just couldn‚Äôt think of anything else better to do, I felt compelled to watch the fire.

I was there maybe 10-15 minutes when James comes back and sat in his camp chair next to mine not saying a word. The fire eventually died down to embers, it was about 11:30am this stage when I snapped out of the sleep-like trance and I heard that diesel 4wd in the distance get louder and louder to the point I could tell it was driving right by us on the road.

At this point we both sort of tilted our heads to listen whilst looking in the direction of the vehicle‚Äôs engine noise waiting for it to come through our hidden track but it just droned on past us and eventually out of ear shot. It must have just been another hunter or visitor to the forest - after all diesel 4wds in the bush are one of the most common types of vehicle.

I was fully alert by this stage and feeling much more at ease, I turned to James and asked him how he was which he replied with half a smile on his face:

‚ÄúFuck this guy, who the fuck does he think he is trying to fuck with us, just because we don‚Äôt live out in inbred country he thinks he can fuck with us and we‚Äôll just move on out of his precious hunting grounds?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell Fuck that I ain‚Äôt going nowhere.‚Äù

I was surprised by his apparent anger and protest of what had happened as James is definitely not a guy who loves a fight and really he was not a usually an angry guy, but who can blame him for being angry after someone had disrespected us and messed with our camp whilst we weren‚Äôt there. It is one of the rules of camping: Unless you need help you do not go into another camp when it‚Äôs unattended. It is rude and will get you a beating if you wander into the wrong person‚Äôs camp.

So at this point, I asked James if he wanted to move camp, which before I sat down at the fire I was determined to do but now I wasn‚Äôt so concerned for some strange reason. He said no let‚Äôs give it another night as he rummaged around in the esky pulling out bacon and eggs for breakfast even though at this stage it was closer to lunch.

I had started to rationalise it and thought about what had happened and if it was really that bad: My sleeping bag was rolled up. We heard a vehicle in the distance but never saw it. The fire was burning when we got back to camp. STAY WARM BUT DON‚ÄôT BURN was inscribed in the frost of my windscreen. My bed was messed with. It is weird the stay warm thing made sense with the fire going, the bed thing is also strange but somewhat non-threatening the only threatening thing was the Don‚Äôt Burn part of the message. But was it a threat or a warning? I didn‚Äôt know. I really didn‚Äôt.

After what turned out to be brunch we talked about what we should do. James suggested that we just go about our business and see if anything else happens, he said it could have been kids coming through trying to scare us and they‚Äôve moved on, I hadn‚Äôt told him about how my sleeping bag was rolled up the night before yet but I sort of was nonchalant about the whole thing now and didn‚Äôt really care nor did I feel in that much danger, I was just a bit spooked out. I don‚Äôt know why my feelings changed so quickly as when James stormed off I was determined that we were leaving or at the very least, moving camp.

He said ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll stay just another night‚Äù.

I agreed and said we should just explore around the camp to see if we missed a cabin or other campers in the area.

So we stayed together and we looked around seeing nothing out of the ordinary in the immediate vicinity of camp but we followed the clearing which was long and narrow to one end and doubled back past camp to check if anything had happened (nothing did) and walked to the other end.

Once we got back to camp we decided to see what was on the other side of pine plantation. We had our rifles with us incase we saw some deer and to make sure they couldn‚Äôt be stolen. When we got to the other side of the pine plantation there was a beautiful clearing it was circular and covered on all sides as if someone just decided to clear and mow the area. It was a bit odd that this clearing was here, it didn‚Äôt seem like it was supposed to belong. Whilst pondering about the existence of this clearning I heard crashing on the opposite side of the clearing and into the brush. I quickly raised my rifle to see if it was a deer but what I saw couldn‚Äôt have been be further from a deer. I just caught a quick glimpse of blue jeans and workboots for like two steps that disappeared into the thick scrub. I screamed out: ‚ÄúHEY YOU COME BACK‚Äù

To which all we heard in reply was maniacal giggling.

I looked at James he was already looking at me and I suggested we go back to camp he/she/it might double back there to mess with us.

So we headed back to camp but came in a different way to the way we left and we stalked up on camp as if it was a deer we were about to shoot.

Both of us had our rifles in hand which I realised was odd as we‚Äôd usually have them slung over our shoulder I guess we were wary as to what happened.

Camp started to come into view, first the top of our 4wd then the top of my tent and then the whole of camp came into view: Nothing was amiss, just the fire gently smoking it‚Äôs last bits of wood away, everything seemed in its place and my tent had not been touched.

At this point I was slightly freaked out, James was as calm as he had been since he walked off into the bush by himself.

I was curious about this and asked him why he screamed into my face and stormed off.

His reply was:

‚ÄúWhat the fuck do you mean? You are the one who yelled at me and you walked off!‚Äù

I got real mad and barked at him:

‚ÄúMate don‚Äôt bullshit me, you screamed in my fucking face and walked off down there‚Äù - Pointing towards the pine plantation we had not long walked through.

‚ÄúLike Fuck I did, I came by and sat at the fire after you had your little tanty (tantrum)!‚Äù

I just went quiet, I knew full well the opposite happened and wasn‚Äôt about to push the issue any further. I‚Äôm a skeptical guy, I don‚Äôt believe in ghosts, afterlife or any of that crap I knew how it went down and he definitely went into the bush whilst I stayed by the fire.

At this point I went and said to James that we should pack up and leave before dark. We haven‚Äôt seen a deer or pig and we are wasting our time here to be terrorised by whoever we saw in the clearing.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be a bitch man, nothing has happened let‚Äôs just go get our deer, I didn‚Äôt come here to come back empty handed and my freezer is empty‚Äù James demanded. I thought maybe he was right but I was still unsure. But I went along maybe it was just stress that is leading us to clash.

We hung around camp for an hour before gearing up to go on another hunt.

We walked straight down the road our track came off and down the bottom of the forest where the pine met a clearing and it then when to native gum scrub.

I felt safer when I had my rifle in my hand. I thought to myself at least if something happens I have some form of defense.

Over the top of the clearing we come across what seemed to be some old sheds from what must have once been a farm.

It looked like people would often camp here and Slim did point this area out to us during his tour.

We walked up to the sheds to investigate.

There was a dead wombat lying near the shed, it had been dead for a while but wasn‚Äôt smelly as it was the middle of winter.

Everything seemed normal and we moved on down the gully to sit out dusk and see if any deer would come out to feed.

We saw nothing but a few kangaroos and a wombat that walked within 5m of us so we knew we weren‚Äôt scaring the deer off as the other animals didn‚Äôt notice us.

We headed back with what we thought would be enough time to get back to camp before dark.

As we approached the sheds that‚Äôs when the truly weird shit happened, the wombat was gone, someone had moved it, you could even see the depression in the grass where it was once lying.

Now James started to get freaked out as he ordered: ‚ÄúCome on lets go back to camp‚Äù He started to march quickly back in the direction of camp. He was walking so fast I had trouble keeping up with him and he didn‚Äôt slow the entire way back I was always about 5m behind him.

We get back to camp just on dark. The fire was stacked with wood and covered with unmistakeable smell of diesel fuel as if we interrupted someone trying to light it quickly.

James completely ignored that when he pulled out his headlamp and was looking around camp as if he was looking for something. I felt compelled to do the same. My bed hadn‚Äôt been touched, James‚Äôs had pine cones laid over his swag in an arrow shape pointing towards the car this was weird but now we knew someone had been there. I looked over at my car and on the bonnet of the car was a small pool of liquid. It was blood.

There it was the wombat hanging upside down from one of its rear back legs in the tree over my 4wd spinning ever so slightly in the cold breeze. It‚Äôs entrails had been torn out hanging about a metre lower than the wombat‚Äôs upside down head. The blood was slowly running down its guts and dripping onto the bonnet of my car. That is when I noticed it had something in its mouth, it took me a while to work out what it was. It was a sock, more specifically it was one of my socks a black sock with blue on the heel and toes.

I called over to James and he saw it - he got mad, he just started shooting at the wombat in what must have been fear and anger, it was the first physical thing that had been left there. the first thing that both of us could truly know that it wasn‚Äôt either one of us, the first real proof that we were a part of some psycho‚Äôs reign of terror.

James calls it:

‚ÄúYou were right let‚Äôs pack up and get the fuck out of here.‚Äù

We both keep our rifles slung over our shoulders whilst we hurriedly pack up camp and prepare to leave that is when we hear the drone of the diesel coming up to our location. I sneak over to the track and hide behind a tree anticipating the 4wd to pass me so I can confirm it is this Slim guy. I chamber a round in my rifle and wait.

I finally start to see light crack through the trees ‚Äúhe is not far away now‚Äù I think to myself.

He is going slow maybe 10km/h as if he is looking for something. As he approaches my location he stops and I get my first confirmation it was Slim. He still doesn‚Äôt know I am there as I peak my head around the corner watching what he does.

He has his interior light on and is looking down at his lap which I find odd but then he lifts up what must be be a smoke as he licks down the side of it and puts it in his mouth and lights it up then he drives on but this time he nails it and by the time I lost sight of him he must have been doing 60km/h.

Did he know I was watching him? WTF it was so weird that he stopped exactly where I was hiding.

By the time I get back James has most of the truck packed, his swag, my swag are in the back so is all the other camping gear we just have to pack up the tent and his tarp and we‚Äôll be out of here.

That is when we heard the diesel again but saw no lights, we then heard yelling:

‚ÄúYOU BETTER LEAVE RIGHT NOW BOYS YOU DON‚ÄôT WANNA GET BURNT‚Äù ‚ÄúLEAVE NOW OR BURN HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA‚Äù ‚ÄúLEAVE NO OR BURN HAHAHAHA, LEAVE NOW OR BURN HAHAHAHA‚Äù The voice said this over and over as we rush to the pack up. We left the tent and tarp there we didn‚Äôt care about that, we had everything else and we were both proper scared now.

We jump in our car and we fucking nail it towards what we think is the exit of the forest.

We bloody got lost again! I drive and drive for about 45 mins and I‚Äôm driving as fast as I can without crashing.

We then saw something we didn‚Äôt expect to see: Rural Fire Service Trucks.

They saw us too I honked my horn at them but they kept driving. Seeing as we were so lost we decided to follow them thinking they will be able to tell us how to get out.

So we followed the two trucks and sure enough they bloody drove straight to our camp site where there was Slim‚Äôs ute waiting for them.

We didn‚Äôt know what to do at this stage other than get out and see what the commotion was about. We were more comfortable knowing there was six firies there and that is when we pulled up and walked down the track to what was left of our campsite.

The whole camp was set on fire my tent was no more just a melted black mass on the ground the trees where James‚Äôs tarp was tied to were burning and once the firies were well on the way to extinguishing the fire the Chief started questioning us as to why we burnt the area.

The fire chief barks at us: ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you put your fire out before you bloody left?‚Äú ‚ÄúIf it wasn‚Äôt for Slim radioing HQ the whole forest could have bloody went up!‚Äù ‚ÄúFucking city wankers coming here not having a clue, don‚Äôt ever come here again, we mean it you ain‚Äôt fucking welcome around here again!‚Äù

I looked over at Slim wanting to kill him he looked back at me with an evil look on his face as he mouthed ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say a fucking word.‚Äù His stare was so intense, I could have swore he said out loud: ‚ÄúBurn you cunts‚Äù but no one reacted so I must have imagined it but James would later confirm he thought he heard him say it as well. Due to this we didn‚Äôt protest to the accusations, Slim was well and truly under our skin now.

The firies put the last of the fire out and begrudgingly said we could follow them out and they directed us back to Oberon.

We got into Oberon late that night and checked into the local pub which had rooms to let at about 9pm.

As we were walking back to our car to get some clothes we saw the last person we wanted leaning up against the street rolling a smoke with a beer can on the bonnet.

We stopped dead in our tracks he raised his eyes over his rollie to look at us, an evil smile rolled across his face and then started that maniacal giggling that we heard back in the clearing.

We didn‚Äôt even bother returning the keys to the pub we just hopped in our car and drove back to Sydney and would later post the keys back to the pub.

When we were unpacking our gear we found a note that was tucked into a spare pair of boots I had and it read: ‚ÄúFeeling hot? See ya next time boys!‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know exactly what happened or what we did to Slim or even who Slim was but there was some spooky shit that went on that weekend and we can‚Äôt explain it.

We both have nightmares about it all the time.

Everytime I see a 4wd like Slim‚Äôs I tremble. It‚Äôs so strange It‚Äôs so scary but for some weird reason both of us have talked about the next time we go back there.

I feel drawn to the place and so does James but we swore if we ever went back we would go together and we must try to fight the urge.

Does anyone have any thoughts on what happened and why we feel compelled to go back? Anybody have any idea of the James swearing blind (Still to this day) that I was the one who in fact walked off after we came back to the lit fire and message?

I would love answers as right now I have none but I just feel I need to go back!

Should we?""",3,1738462547.0,mrballen,1,1.0,False

Boring,"I know this is not news to any of you I‚Äôm sure but I was out this evening for a friends birthday - we are all pretty big drinkers (well, I‚Äôm not anymore üòÅ). The first hour or two were fun - it was nice to catch up with people and talk and laugh. Then everyone slowly started descending into being sloppy and out of it (drunk). The conversations no longer felt like normal conversations, it was like I couldn‚Äôt understand the timing of things. The jokes weren‚Äôt funny and honestly I started to feel annoyed by the way people were interacting with me. 

I‚Äôm not judging at all because I know that this was me and is anyone who is drinking but it was just really frustrating to stop enjoying others company this evening because of the slide into sloppy madness. 

This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve noticed it and it does make going out in the evening a struggle for me. Currently my approach has been to leave once I notice ‚Äòthe change‚Äô happen. I‚Äôve realised that I much prefer sober centred activities (walk, lunch, coffee, gaming, museum, exercise) to the nighttime stuff. 

Just some thoughts. Hope everyone‚Äôs having a good weekend.

The early bird gets the worm, and the saying seems to ring true when it comes to some of our most successful public figures and their morning habits.
While it‚Äôs an Aussie habit to rise with the sun, high-flyers seem to take that one step further, with a study of over 1000 US CEOs by Inc. magazine in 2022 finding 64 per cent wake up by 6am or earlier.

But breakfast TV host Natalie Barr is partway through her working day on the television screen by then, woken by her alarm at an eye-watering 2.40am to make it to Seven‚Äôs Sunrise studio in time for cameras to start rolling at 5.30am.

Barr‚Äôs secret to the surviving her perfect early wakeup is planning- and a coffee by 3am.

‚ÄúI think after 22 years of this shift, my body starts getting ready to get up somewhere around 2.00am and I wake up, stare at the ceiling, toss and turn, debate trying to go back to sleep, give up and get up somewhere before 2.30am,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI always put my clothes out in the bathroom the night before because, hey, every minute counts and I love organisation.‚Äù

For star NRL player and Manly Sea Eagles captain Tom Trbojevich, stretches and an ice-cold shower get him started to take on the day, while Australian Olympic Committee boss Matt Caroll has a more leisurely start, strolling along Sydney‚Äôs Balmoral Beach with his pooch Marge.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better to have a time for clear thoughts before the calls, the texts and the emails commence,‚Äù Carroll said.

From morning exercise to the first coffee of the day, we reveal how some of our top talent in the boardroom, on-screen and on the sporting field start their days.

CHRIS MINNS
Premier Chris Minns starts his morning at 5am with a quick 30-minute exercise burst either at home or at the gym. Kettle bells are an old favourite and there‚Äôs a focus on body weights.

At 5:30am he checks in with his staff and reads all the newspapers and gets on top of what‚Äôs running across the radio. If there‚Äôs any issues that have arisen overnight, he prepares himself to respond.

‚ÄúEvery morning is different,‚Äù Mr Minns said.

‚ÄúIf I have morning TV and radio interviews they are usually early. If I have a press conference, I‚Äôll be reading materials.‚Äù

Otherwise, the NSW leader spends the rest of his morning in the office for meetings or out at events.

‚ÄúIn between all that I‚Äôll get the kids to school,‚Äù he said.

ANTHONY ALBANESE

The Prime Minister‚Äôs morning starts by 6am, if not before.

He reads news summaries and listens to the morning news bulletins, before taking the First Dog, cavoodle Toto, outside before feeding her from 6.30am.

By 7am Mr Albanese is usually making a coffee and checking the country‚Äôs newspapers again, at 7.10am he‚Äôll start the first of the day‚Äôs interviews ‚Äì usually on radio ‚Äì or moving to his first engagement of the day.

At 8am he holds a briefing with his team where the rest of the day‚Äôs agenda is spelt out, and if there‚Äôs time, he‚Äôll take Toto for a walk and make calls.

Likewise, if not whisked away to an event or an interview, he‚Äôll have eggs for breakfast.

Exercise in the morning can be difficult to fit in and depends on where in the country or the world the Prime Minister is, but when in Canberra he‚Äôll sometimes start the day with a swim.

PETER DUTTON

Australia‚Äôs federal Opposition Leader starts his day at 4.30am with exercise between five and six o‚Äôclock.

Mr Dutton, who doesn‚Äôt drink coffee, opts for either peppermint tea or an English breakfast tea next, and also reads the papers after waking up

‚ÄúHe likes the gym and he likes to walk. He will walk seven to 10 kilometres when he can,‚Äù Mr Dutton‚Äôs camp revealed.

‚ÄúIf we are limited on time, he will try to go to the gym. Rowing, cycling, some weight work, talking on the treadmill.‚Äù

Then it‚Äôs time for an office meeting usually between 6-7am before breakfast after which a day of engagements begins.

Although not a part of his morning routine, Mr Dutton is also an avid meditator, meditating daily before bed.

‚ÄúHe meditates but he generally does that in the evening before he goes to bed. It helps him sleep and relax. He‚Äôs been a big advocate for that,‚Äù a team member said.

JOHN SYMOND

It‚Äôs a waterfront start for the Aussie Home Loans founder, who‚Äôll wake each day inside ‚ÄòWingadal‚Äô, his $200m Point Piper home.

‚ÄúI get up at 5:45 every morning, shower and freshen up. I‚Äôm a poor sleeper, I always have been ever since I was a teenager,‚Äù Mr Symond said.

‚ÄúI get up two to three times a night, so it means I‚Äôm also an early riser. I also make sure I don‚Äôt look at my phone during the night.‚Äù

Next, it‚Äôs a pit stop at Double Bay for a coffee for half an hour at 6.30am, where he meets with half a dozen of friends he‚Äôs collected over the years

‚ÄúThey vary from someone who cleans my car to successful business owners, you name it,‚Äù Mr Symond said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a work thing and we talk about anything ‚Äì headlines, politics, cars. It‚Äôs to relax.‚Äù

Mr Symond then hits the gym with his personal trainer for 45 minutes, and is home by 8am to freshen up before starting his workday with emails at 9 and his first meeting of the day within his home office by 9.30am.

MATT CARROLL

Matt Carroll steps out in a phone-free cocoon at 6am every day, leaving the mobile at home to walk his dog in the ‚Äúmost beautiful spot in the world‚Äù.

The Australian Olympic Committee CEO, who has held a number of high-flying positions over three decades including as CEO of NSW Rugby Union, the Waratahs, the A-League and Australian Sailing, makes a deliberate choice to start the working day free from any distractions.

‚ÄúI start the morning with a walk down the hill, around the oval and along the boardwalk at Balmoral. It‚Äôs the most beautiful spot in the world,‚Äù Mr Carroll said.

‚ÄúJust 30 minutes, with (pet spoodle) Marge, and I don‚Äôt take the phone. You see so many people on their phones when they could be enjoying the view.

‚ÄúI just find it relaxes the brain before getting into the day.‚Äù

Mr Carroll, who heads off to work at 7.30 each morning, has announced he will step down during 2025 after five years at the AOC.

KERRIE MATHER

The Venues NSW CEO is a business powerhouse used to smashing through corporate glass ceilings.

After a 25-year career at Macquarie Group, she was appointed Managing Director and CEO at Sydney Airport from 2009 to 2018, when a $3.8 million salary made her one of Australia‚Äôs highest paid female executives.

Ms Mather was later appointed CEO of the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust, becoming the first female to hold the position in its 160-year history.

Now as CEO of Venues NSW ‚Äì a government agency that manages stadiums and entertainment centres ‚Äì Ms Mathers has a regular routine to start each day.

‚ÄúI like to start my mornings with a brisk walk,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWe live in one of the great cities of the world and getting outside to enjoy it is the perfect way to start the day.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm an early riser and too often late-to-bed given the nature of our business. But I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.

‚ÄúMy favourite early mornings are at the SCG, waiting for the gates to open before the New Year‚Äôs Pink Test, with anticipation building and a sense of eerie quiet before the excitement begins.‚Äù

WESTPAC CEO ANTHONY MILLER

Sport-loving Westpac CEO Anthony Miller, who took over at the bank pre-Christmas, has been a stickler for routine since his formative years.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm usually up at 5am ‚Äì swim training in my younger years drilled the early starts into me and they‚Äôre hard to drop,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThese days the exercise routine is a bit more relaxed ‚Äì a body weight workout, and I‚Äôm also trying to change things up by adding a boxing class.

‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs into the office by around 7am, with a double espresso as an essential kickstarter and maybe one more later on if it‚Äôs a big day.

‚ÄúIn footy season one of the first things I read on Monday mornings is the rugby league coverage in the Daily Tele to get a good roundup of the weekend‚Äôs games.

‚ÄúOf course, I‚Äôll also skim through the news and finance coverage across papers and online as well.

‚ÄúDuring the day I really try to build in half an hour around lunchtime to myself, to think about priorities and focus.‚Äù

Mr Miller joined Westpac in 2020 from Deutsche Bank where he was CEO of Australia & NZ and Co-Head of Investment Bank, Asia Pacific.

Earlier in his career he was a partner at Goldman Sachs, joining that company in 2001.

HOME AND AWAY STAR ADA NICODEMOU

There are three non-negotiables for the Home and Away star in the morning- coffee, something to eat and a load of washing on.

‚ÄúAs soon as I wake up I go upstairs and first thing that I do is turn the coffee machine on, then have my probiotic,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the one thing that I don‚Äôt skip ever, my coffee. I have a double espresso with two dollops of cream and I always make my first one myself.‚Äù

Next up it‚Äôs the washing and getting her son Johnas up and ready for school.

Then it‚Äôs off to work for Nicodemou to play Summer Bay‚Äôs Leah Patterson with a 6am call time which kicks off in the makeup chair with coffee number two.

‚ÄúThe make-up room is a great place to be in the morning,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always quite loud in there. There‚Äôs a lot of laughter and supposedly I‚Äôm the loudest. It is a really great way to start the day.‚Äù

While Nicodemou dabbles in meditation at home when she can squeeze it in, this year she plans on slowing her morning routine down.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do meditation enough,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúAnd at the moment, I feel like wonder woman in the morning and I turn up to work exhausted because I‚Äôve already done 15,000 jobs.

‚ÄúI need to breathe. Slow it down a little.‚Äù",0,1738462371.0,aussie,0,0.25,False
