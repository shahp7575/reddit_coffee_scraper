1k0gu0x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k0gu0x,YOKOHAMA HYATT REGENCY 2025,"YOKOHAMA HYATT REVIEW – 4.5/5

Our stay at the Yokohama Hyatt was a great experience overall.

Hotel Staff:
The staff were excellent—very attentive, respectful, and always eager to help. Their hospitality really stood out and made our stay feel special.

Location:
While it’s a bit removed from the busier parts of Yokohama, the location is peaceful and quiet, which we appreciated. There’s a Lawson right across from the lobby and a 7-11 just a 2-minute walk away. The subway is about a 5-minute walk, and multiple bus stops are right outside the hotel, making it convenient to get around.

Club Lounge:
The lounge itself is a bit small and can get crowded at times. Breakfast was okay—fairly standard for Japan, with a consistent but tasty buffet. Coffee was a highlight! I especially loved the cappuccinos from the espresso machine. The lounge is open from 7am–8pm, which was super convenient—we often stopped in to grab a drink while dropping off bags or freshening up during the day.

Room (Twin Room):
Our twin room on the 19th floor was very comfortable for a family of three. Spacious by Japan standards, with a great ocean view. The beds were comfortable, although the pillows were a bit too soft for my taste. Amenities were top-notch—the Tea Tree products (A+ brand) were amazing and a big hit with my wife and daughter. Chromecast was a huge bonus—we could easily stream our shows after a long day. Daily cleaning was much appreciated; coming back to a tidy room with fresh linens and that clean scent was always nice. Also, we definitely made good use of the coffee maker every morning!

Final Thoughts:
Overall, a great stay. The attention to detail, quality service, and relaxing environment make the Yokohama Hyatt a solid choice. Just a few small things (like the lounge size and pillow preference) kept it from being a perfect 5—but we’d absolutely stay here again!",1,1744798206.0,hyatt,0,1.0,False

Sooo, we absolutely wanted to know more about Anne Rice's witches after we read *Merrick* last month, so we will start this new adventure by reading her *Lives of the Mayfair Witches* series! 

The series can be read as a **standalone**, there is no need to have any previous knowledge of Anne Rice's other works, so if you would like to give this (big) read a try you are welcome!

[**Book blurb**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11901.The_Witching_Hour)

>!On the veranda of a great New Orleans house, now faded, a mute and fragile woman sits rocking... and The Witching Hour begins.!<

>!It begins in our time with a rescue at sea.  Rowan Mayfair, a beautiful woman, a brilliant practitioner of neurosurgery—aware that she has special powers but unaware that she comes from an ancient line of witches—finds the drowned body of a man off the coast of California and brings him to life.  He is Michael Curry, who was born in New Orleans and orphaned in childhood by fire on Christmas Eve, who pulled himself up from poverty, and who now, in his brief interval of death, has acquired a sensory power that mystifies and frightens him.!<

>!As these two, fiercely drawn to each other, fall in love and—in passionate alliance—set out to solve the mystery of her past and his unwelcome gift, the novel moves backward and forward in time from today's New Orleans and San Francisco to long-ago Amsterdam and a château in the France of Louis XIV.  An intricate tale of evil unfolds—an evil unleashed in seventeenth-century Scotland, where the first ""witch,"" Suzanne of the Mayfair, conjures up the spirit she names Lasher... a creation that spells her own destruction and torments each of her descendants in turn.!<

>!From the coffee plantations of Port au Prince, where the great Mayfair fortune is made and the legacy of their dark power is almost destroyed, to Civil War New Orleans, as Julien—the clan's only male to be endowed with occult powers—provides for the dynasty its foothold in America, the dark, luminous story encompasses dramas of seduction and death, episodes of tenderness and healing.  And always—through peril and escape, tension and release—there swirl around us the echoes of eternal war: innocence versus the corruption of the spirit, sanity against madness, life against death.  With a dreamlike power, the novel draws us, through circuitous, twilight paths, to the present and Rowan's increasingly inspired and risky moves in the merciless game that binds her to her heritage. And in New Orleans, on Christmas Eve, this strangest of family sagas is brought to its startling climax.!<

1k0gqp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SophiaShay7/comments/1k0gqp6/in_progress/,In progress,"Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) is the most common form of systemic Mast Cell Disease and is known to cause Dysautonomia in some but not all patients. Histamine, serotonin, and dopamine are all neurotransmitters that play a role in regulating sleep-wake cycles and helping the brain transition from sleep to wakefulness. A histamine dump happens when your body produces too much histamine that builds up in the brain. Histamine dumps often happen late at night or early in the morning. You might suddenly feel changes in body temperature, itchiness, or blood pressure changes as your histamine levels rise.

Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) is an immunological condition in which mast cells, a type of white blood cell, inappropriately and excessively release chemical mediators, such as histamine, resulting in a range of chronic symptoms, sometimes including anaphylaxis or near-anaphylaxis attacks. Primary symptoms include cardiovascular, dermatological, gastrointestinal, neurological, and respiratory problems.

[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome](https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-treatments/related-conditions/mcas)

>Patients who suffer from MCAS may experience symptoms in 2 or more organ systems and may mistake physical symptoms for other conditions. In the gastrointestinal tract, symptoms may include diarrhea, constipation, general abdominal discomfort, GERD, bloating/distension and cramping. Neurologic MCAS symptoms may mimic other conditions and appear as OCD-like thoughts and behaviors, mood swings, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and fatigue. Some people who suffer from MCAS experience more typical allergy-like symptoms including wheezing, rashes, hives, skin flushing/itching, and sinusitis. Other skin conditions like cysts, cystic acne, and edema are also common occurrences. Reactions to heat, altitude, alcohol, artificial dyes/additives and certain environmental allergens like pollen and mold all fit under the MCAS umbrella of symptoms. Reproductive system conditions like unusual menstrual cycles and endometriosis; fibromyalgia-like joint pain; and blood pressure/heart-rate dysregulation are all possible symptoms as well. Indeed, MCAS can and does exist alongside other common conditions like IBS, mood disorders, SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth), POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) and others, making diagnosis complex.

>Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) presents with heterogenous multisystemic inflammatory and allergic manifestations. MCAS is characterized by patterns of aberrant mast cell (MC) overactivity. Mast cell activation disease (MCAD), which includes MCAS and mastocytosis, is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, including various types of dysautonomia, neuropathy (including small fiber neuropathy), myalgia, migraine, headache, cognitive dysfunction, restless legs syndrome, sleep disturbance, non-pulsatile tinnitus, depression, generalized anxiety, and panic attacks. MCAS is the most common variant of MCAD and has an estimated prevalence of 17% in the general population. Despite a significant prevalence, this hyperactive immune disorder is usually not considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with multisystemic symptoms. This is in part due to its relatively recent discovery (2007) and it is generally not included in medical school curriculum .

H1 and H2 Histamine Blocker Protocol for MCAS:

>H1 and H2 histamine receptors are two main classes of histamine receptors that are involved in many different bodily functions:                                             

>●H1 histamine receptors.                                                   
These receptors are found in many tissues, including immune cells, smooth muscle, and endothelium. They play a role in regulating vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, and atrial muscle contractility. H1 receptors are also involved in cellular migration and nociception. Antihistamines that bind to H1 receptors are often used to treat allergies and allergic rhinitis, such as hives, itchy skin, itchy eyes, runny nose, and sneezing.  

>Commonly used H1 antagonists currently available in the United States are cetirizine, levocetirizine, desloratadine, loratadine, and fexofenadine.                                                   

>●H2 histamine receptors.                                                  
These receptors are mainly found in gastric parietal cells but are also present in vascular smooth muscle, neutrophils, suppressor T cells, the CNS, and the heart. H2 receptors are primarily involved in stimulating gastric acid secretion, which is closely linked to the development of peptic ulcers. H2 receptors also modify airway mucus production and vascular permeability. Antihistamines that bind to H2 receptors are often used to treat upper gastrointestinal conditions caused by excessive stomach acid, such as gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) and peptic ulcers. 

>Commonly used H2 antagonists currently available in the United States are cimetidine, famotidine
and nizatidine.

Mast Cell Stabilizers and Other Medications:

>Mast cell stabilizers are medications that can help treat a range of symptoms by limiting calcium flow across the mast cell membrane. This prevents the release of vasoactive substances and degranulation. 
Mast cell stabilizers are often prescribed in combination with histamine blockers. These medications include Cromolyn, Ketotifen, Lodoxamide, 
Nedocromil, Pemirolast, and Epinastine hydrochloride.

>[Other medications used are included here](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/mast-cell-activation-syndrome). They include Montelukast, Singular, and Xolair.

It may be a Histamine Intolerance (HIT) instead or MCAS. Because histamine intolerance involves the mast cells, it is often confused with mast cell activation. The difference, however, is that with MCAS, mast cells secrete multiple mediators in addition to histamine—whereas in histamine intolerance, the mast cells release only histamines and nothing else.

If your Allergist/Immunologist is unable to perform the necessary tests, you may need a referral to a Hematologist who specializes in MCAS.

Many people recommend an elimination diet or a low histamine diet. 

[Food Compatibility List-Histamine/MCAS](https://www.mastzellaktivierung.info/downloads/foodlist/SIGHI-FoodList_EN_Histamin_alphabetisch_inKategorien.pdf)

[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome and Diet](https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthfacts/8114)

Diamine oxidase (DAO) is an enzyme that breaks down histamine in the gut, and DAO supplements may help with symptoms of histamine intolerance. When using DAO, it is important to first lower the histamine levels. Therefore, we recommend following a low-histamine diet for at least two weeks before starting DAO. After these two weeks, you can begin taking DAO three times a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner) while still following a low-histamine diet.

There is no cure for MCAS, but treatments can help manage symptoms. These include avoiding triggers, taking medications that block chemicals released by mast cells, managing stress levels, speaking with a mental health professional, and having self-injectable epinephrine at all times. Some medications that can trigger Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) symptoms include: opioids, antibiotics, NSAIDs, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, alcohol-containing medicines, intravenous vancomycin, neuromuscular junction blocking agents, and local anesthetics.

If your Allergist/Immunologist is unable to perform the necessary tests, you may need a referral to a Hematologist who specializes in MCAS.

How can I get tested for MCAS? 
                                                                        
●Your allergist/Immunologist can diagnose Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) by considering a patient's symptom history, physical exam, and lab tests. A diagnosis is appropriate if symptoms are recurrent, accompanied by increased mast cell-derived chemical mediators, and responsive to treatment. 

●Blood or urine tests.                                                 
These tests can measure mast cell mediators, such as tryptase, histamine, or prostaglandins, which increase during an episode. However, tryptase levels can be elevated in other conditions, so levels alone don't indicate MCAS. A patient should be tested multiple times, both when feeling well and during an episode.                                                                      

●Other factors that may be considered include:              
○An allergy skin test or allergy blood tests to rule out other causes of symptoms.                                          
○A trial of treatment using inhibitors of mast cell mediators, such as antihistamines or other drugs that block chemicals released by mast cells.       

I would research H1 and H2 histamine blockers. There are plenty that are available over the counter. It's recommended to take double the normal dose, one dose of each antihistamine, morning and evening. Many people have recommended cetirizine or Xyzol for H1 and famotidine for H2. 

[Best Antihistamine For Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS)](https://www.drbrucehoffman.com/post/best-antihistamine-for-mast-cell-activation-syndrome)

My symptoms didn't completely line up with MCAS initially. My symptoms have continued to get worse with dry, itchy, watery, and goopy eyes and reactions to certain foods after eating. I started drinking my favorite hazelnut coffee I haven't had in nine months because I switched brands. Now I'm having MCAS symptoms. I'm itchy, sneezing, and have a runny nose after eating or drinking things that don't agree with me. I'm allergic to the fillers in my thyroid medication.

I started the MCAS protocol. I'm took Cetirizine for H1 and Famotidine for H2. I took one dose of each morning and evening. It caused worsening tachycardia and adrenaline or histamine dumps. I was also extremely nauseous. That never happened before. I switched to taking one dose of each Cetirizine and Famotidine in the morning only. My new and worsening symptoms didn't improve. I had to stop. 
I learned that in some people, MCAS symptoms are too severe that OTC medications don't work. And/or we're allergic to the fillers in the OTCs. That's what happened to me.  I take Fluticasone and Hydroxyzine for MCAS. Omeprazole for Gerd (it's a PPI that also acts as a mast cell stabilizer). 

>Please read. This is very important: 

>There are a lot of symptoms associated with MCAS. A lot! ...And many of the symptoms in MCAS can be attributed to other conditions! Some people have primarily gut symptoms, others experience respiratory symptoms; some have more skin issues, and others have significant cognitive issues.  

>Testing for MCAS is not very accurate at this time, primarily due to the short-lived nature of the molecules that we can test for, so we have to rely on a collection of symptoms and the response to treatments to make a diagnosis. 

>Instead of reading through the list of symptoms, however, I recommend starting with the questionnaire below. It is based off the questionnaire found in Dr. Lawrence Afrin’s 2014 article, [A concise, practical guide to diagnostic assessment for mast cell activation disease.](https://www.wjgnet.com/2218-6204/full/v3/i1/1.htm). I just simplified the language in the list, and categorized the questions differently (to make it easier to fill out)!

>The questionnaire at the end of this article is one of the more validated ways to diagnose suspected MCAS. It is based off symptoms, medical history, and test results. It will take 5-10 minutes to complete, and there is no need to share email information – completing it will just give you a score.

>We must remember that MCAS is still a poorly understood condition, and information is constantly evolving. Right now, we don’t have good tests to definitively diagnose MCAS.

>The questionnaire is at the bottom of this link:

>[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS)-Collaborative Medicine](https://www.collaborativemed.com/mast-cell-activation-syndrome-mcas-diagnosis/)

>This link details MCAS, what it is, what causes it, tests to diagnose it, why testing is often unreliable, and how to treat MCAS with a multifaceted approach. Although it's from a functional medicine doctor, it is the most comprehensive source I've found.

>Some individuals who contract COVID-19 are experiencing symptoms like extreme fatigue, brain fog, chest pain and palpitations, shortness of breath, headaches, sleep disruptions, GI issues, and even rashes that continue on for weeks after the initial COVID-19 infection has cleared up - and in many cases these are even lasting for months, or years. These symptoms tend to also worsen after any sort of physical or mental exertion. The medical community has termed this “Long-COVID” or “COVID Long-Hauler Syndrome.” In fact, a surprising rate of about 30% of COVID-19 patients experiences these long-term symptoms after the initial COVID infection. It also resembles the symptom list of those living with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS).

>The prevalence of MCAS is similar to that of severe cases within the Covid-19-infected population. Much of Covid-19’s hyperinflammation is concordant with manners of inflammation which MC activation can drive. Drugs with activity against MCs or their mediators have preliminarily been observed to be helpful in Covid-19 patients. None of the authors’ treated MCAS patients with Covid-19 suffered severe infection, let alone mortality.

>Studies are now suggesting that there is a connection between long haulers and MCAS, finding that the symptoms of long haulers occur because the COVID-19 virus actually triggers mast cells to activate (MCAS) and the subsequent cytokine storms. “Long COVID’ describes post-COVID-19 syndrome when symptoms persist for more than 12 weeks after initial infection with no alternative diagnosis. Both mast cell activation syndrome and long COVID cause multiple symptoms. It is theorized that COVID-19 infection could lead to exaggeration of existing undiagnosed mast cell activation syndrome, or could activate normal mast cells owing to the persistence of viral particles.”

Since then, they have deleted their account, and I am unable to post this as a comment. So here it the post:   
  
  
 **I’m not going to get into what I do for a living. That’s not the point of this post.**

This is for the **girls and guys in DZ** who want *more*.  
Who feel like they’re starting from the margins.  
Who want out—but want to do it with **dignity, excellence, and heart**.  
  
**Networking? Hard.**  
  
I lived, walked, and breathed the question: *“How can I reach X, Y, Z and actually speak to them?”*  
Entrepreneurs, political figures, CEOs—you name it. my southern ""Goutlo/Gali"" did not hold me back. My struggling student outfits did not hold me back. having no car did not hold me back. not knowing fine dining etiquette did not hold me back. I am there; 20; and ready to learn. TEACH me, is what I would utter at the dullest moment and people seemed to react very well. i am 30 and it is still my philosophy. 

I leveraged every tool I had: AIESEC, the school's student club, decent English, solid communication skills… and yes, being pretty helped.

But the **real currency**?  
  
My ability to talk to *anyone* about *anything*—politics, tech, history, you name it.  
And when I didn’t know jack about something, I’d smile, say I was having a blonde moment, and let people explain.  
Especially men—they loved it. Some made it their mission to teach me things.

Older established women—not the catty type—offered guidance, support, and mentorship.  
Many said they saw younger versions of themselves in me. That was very empowering.

At 21—ten years ago—I landed a freelance translation gig with a transnational agro-food company **while at the airport** on my way to an event I’d gotten into through networking.

That gig paid 8–12 million per assignment. For a dorm-living student, barely spending anything, that was *insane* money. I even pulled in a couple of friends who needed it too.

I said **yes** to everything. That boring Arduino session? I’m in. Making a case for green tech? I’m in.  
Hackathons? Debates? Count me in. I’d scroll Facebook event pages (it was big back then), pick a few people I wanted to meet, then just… go talk to them.

I studied. **Hard.** Commutes were for podcasts. Summer breaks were for upskilling. I was determined not to be average.  constantly thinking: *Who’s the smartest bunch, and how can I emulate them?*

After my bachelor’s, I moved abroad on a full scholarship. Then again, to another country—also on scholarship. I lived **way below my means.** No eating out. No coffee. Not even bottled water. Walking instead of taking the bus when my student card didn’t cover it during summer.

**My advice?**

\- Become **undeniably good** at what you do. Not just “good enough.” **Be one of the top 3 best.** Harness those specs that are unique to your personality.

I wasn’t the best at my major—it bored me. But I was a good speaker, a good writer, and I took initiative.  
Uncommon for girls at my time—and that won me a lot of good attention.

\- Master your tools:  
**Communication. Timing. Research. Self-awareness. Looks.**  
Be so prepared they *can’t dismiss you*. I’d show up with homework for the people I was meeting:  
Challenging questions, critiques, feedback. Something to show I’d done my research.

I was able to rub shoulders with very esteemed people. You’d think I was one of them. I often got asked: *“Who’s your father?”; ""who are you with here, today/tonight?.""*  I acted like I belonged, and it was genuine. I did feel like I belonged 95% of the time. 

**Cowardice never knew its way to my mind or heart.**  


\- Say yes to things. Learn from everything and everyone: The snobs and the nerdy ones. The rich and the frugal. The girls and the boys. Walk into rooms *even when you feel unqualified*—then listen, ask questions, connect. And **center taqwa, duaa, and prayer**. It will protect you when your hustle can’t.

**- Oh, and social media…**

Looking back, I was unknowingly building a personal brand. having my own blog and being active on other blogs and niche groups. This gained me visibility and I was invited to national and international TV channels, to moderate panels or give a speech.  

Had I kept going, I could’ve easily become an influencer. But over time, I became more conservative.  
My appreciation for privacy—for being **unseen**, for doing things quietly—outweighed the need for visibility. So I deleted everything. **You shouldn’t—unless you’re done with it serving your mission.**

\- Finally, people who are bound to make it… *just know.*

I knew. So I kept going—despite the 1001 hurdles.  
And I still do. 

If people are interested, and this doesn't flop, I can write another post on ""what I wish I did not get into"" - learn from my mistakes.   


I had a huge setback a couple of years ago that I’m still rehabilitating from… But I know, *for certain,* the comeback will be even more impressive.   
  
If any of my words resonated with you, **I ask you to pray for me and my salaḥ**—both in the **dunya** and the **ākhira**, please.  


**Good luck, everyone.**  
I *do* be cheering for our DZ success. 💚🇩🇿

Within few weeks, she had her friend with her at my apartment for some celebration. Her friend was having a boyfriend at that time but hadn’t been sexual yet.

	•	I’ve cut out common triggers like magnesium L-threonate, nuts, large amounts of fruit, and raw veggies, which helped somewhat.
	•	While traveling in Vietnam and Japan, my gut feels WAY better — even when I’m still drinking coffee there.
	•	Back home in Sydney, I brew coffee using boiled tap water or reverse osmosis water. I started suspecting the water might be a hidden factor.

My Theory: Could Reverse Osmosis Water Be Worsening My Gut?

	•	I use an RO filter that adds an alkaline remineralization stage.
	•	I’ve read mixed things about how alkaline or demineralized water might disrupt digestion or gut flora.
	•	Is it possible that the lack of minerals, or the change in water pH, is messing with my gut?

⸻

Other Notes:
	•	Coffee definitely seems to accelerate urgency and looseness, but the exact trigger is unclear.
	•	I also get dry skin and irritation, especially after shaving — not sure if that’s related.
	•	Diet is mostly low-FODMAP and animal-based now, which helps.
	•	I don’t think this is stress-related — it’s food or environment-driven.

Has anyone else had gut issues tied to filtered or RO water? Would love to hear your experiences or if anyone resolved similar symptoms by changing their water source?

Hey, beautiful people of MaximizeMe! So, let’s talk about one of those magical little things that can completely change your day: **your morning routine**. 🌅 Now, I know we’ve all heard the old adage: “Wake up, drink coffee, conquer the world.” But what if I told you that one simple tweak could supercharge your focus before you even down that first cup of joe? Let’s dive in!

For me, it all started with the realization that **my mind was often a jumbled mess** when I woke up. You know, the to-do lists, endless scrolling on my phone, and sometimes even pondering the meaning of life before breakfast. 😅 So, I decided to give my mornings a little makeover.

**Drumroll, please... 🥁** Here’s the one routine hack that helped me focus like a laser beam:

### *Morning Pages* – Yup, it’s as simple as that! 

*What are Morning Pages?* Just three pages of freewriting first thing in the morning. Here’s why it’s been a game changer for me:

- **Brain Dump:** It’s like clearing out all the clutter in your mind. Thoughts, worries, ideas—just spill it all onto the page! 📝
- **Creative Flow:** Suddenly, I feel freer to think! Creativity blossoms when I stop overthinking. It’s amazing how ideas flow when I’m not in my own way.
- **Focus Reset:** After my brain dump, I know what I can let go of and what really matters. Who knew a few hundred words could help me prioritize my day?

### Here’s how I make it work:

1. **Grab a Notebook:** Anything will do! It doesn’t have to be fancy. It just needs to have those blank pages waiting for your genius.
   
2. **Set a Timer:** I usually go for about 15-20 minutes. It’s like a mini deadline, and it makes you get right into it!

3. **No Rules:** Seriously, **no grammar police** here. Just write what comes to mind! It could be “I need to buy milk” or “Why is my cat plotting against me?” 😼

4. **Reflect Before Moving On:** I take a moment after I finish to skim what I’ve written. It’s amazing what pops out at you!

So, here I am, sipping my coffee post-Morning Pages, and *BAM!* I feel ready to tackle anything that comes my way. 🌟

I used to think that mornings were just a chaotic rush to get out the door, but now? They’re my secret weapon for clarity and creativity! 

What about you all? Have you tried something similar, or are you rocking a completely different morning routine? Let’s share those hacks and keep the inspiration flowing! 💬✨",1,1744797026.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Chapter 26

When we hit the *Kraken,* the boys formed a ring me and we simply stood as thousands of men and women cheered in the staging centre. There were hollers, cheers, songs erupted spontaneously. Everyone and his dog tried to pat us on the back. 

The XO was there to greet us. He was a small man from home. As a fellow Hellicon, he came up to me directly and put his arm around me. He was beaming and laughed, “Drinks on me, boys.”

I found it hard to stand and was thankful my suit stifled the painful grunt that came out of me.

Sarge managed to push us through the throng of well-wishers. Thousands of crew swarmed us, cheering and singing. 

There were calls of “Even if the sky falls on them, the Angels of Terra are always victorious!!”

I don’t know for the others but I certainly didn’t feel victorious. The bugs had pushed us back. We had had to flee from their tunnels. 

The XO had his arms around my shoulders. I shrugged him off and said, “We need to debrief.”

The XO seemed hurt and a little taken aback so I added, “But yes, we did reach mission parameters. We will celebrate but after mission debrief.”

We moved off to our quarters and debrief. 

Sarge flashed a message which read, “How are you doing, Haze?”

I grunted and replied, “Fine, Sarge.”

Immediately, the message turned to coms and Sarge’s voice filled my ears, “I have feedback on your bioreads, Haze.”

Shit. True. 

“I’m…”

Sarge cut me off and said, “Report to med bay. I’ll clear it with the Captain.”

All I could say was, “Yes, Sir.”

Twenty minutes later, I was standing in med bay with a shocked looking doc staring at me. Sarge was standing beside me. It was just the three of us in the room.

The doc was a small man, black hair, black eyes, from the European block, Italian accent. He was utterly surprised and in awe when he saw the two of us standing in his office. He did try to remain professional but even to our, untrained eye, he failed miserably. He looked at us, barely able to maintain his composure. He mopped the sweat off his brow, spreading a light yellow smear on the sleeve of his white lab coat. He whipped his hands on his coat and, extending his right one, said, “Specialists. What a surprise! How can we be of service?”

I immediately stated, “I was exposed to an off-world atmosphere. My suit breached and I had difficulty breathing.”

The doc nodded and said, “Toxin inhalation.”

As I continued, “I was also hit by plasma fire. The suit took the brunt of it but that’s how the suit breached.”

“Third-degree burn.”

I went on, “I had a pain in the chest after that.”

“Plasma burn and toxin inhalation will do that. Anything else?”

I shrugged and muttered, “I don’t know. Probably.”

“Okay, I’ll put you through the bioscans and see what’s the problem. Please wait a minute as I calibrate the machine. It’s not meant for people of… well, of your size, Sirs.”

He fidgeted with a few controls and the scanner swirled and hummed. 

He bade me to get undressed and lay naked on the slab and when I did so, the scanner’s probes started buzzing around me. For a second, I thought the scanners looked like bugs. I felt my hands grip the edge of the slab. The thin metal creaked and groaned under the pressure.

The doc muttered, “Relax. You’re going to break the table.”

The scanner flew for a couple of minutes until the lights in the scanner turned blue and a loud beep was heard. 

The doc was looking at the screen and started muttering to himself, “Incredible. Unbelievable.”

Sarge brought him out of his musings and the doctor immediately told me to sit up as he attached some kind of device on my back. A sharp pain hit me but it was nothing compared to what I had just been through planetside. I heard him loud and clear this time, “Astonishing.”

I could feel the skin on my back slowly knitting together. 

“That wound is healing. Visibly healing.”

“Doc? How’s it looking?”

“He should be dead. Look. I can fit my entire fist in that hole. But that’s not the most astonishing. I mean, look!! The hole is closing. Cell division is 3000% faster than a normal human. I mean astonishing doesn’t cover it. I… I didn’t think this was even possible. Look!”, he said to no one in particular, “New flesh is being made. I have never seen anything like this. What are you people?”

Sarge ignored the question and asked, “Is Specialist Haze going to be okay?”

The doc was poking me with something, my flesh twitched in pain. 

“Doc! Focus! Specialist Haze. How’s he doing??”

The doc seemed out of it. He ignored Sarge and went on, “I had heard of the augmentation program but I didn’t think *this* was possible. I mean. You boys are practically indestructible. A wound like this would have torn through a tank. And you’re just… fine. Why hasn’t this become standard practice for all those in service?”

I had an answer to his question but I don’t think it’s what the doc wanted to hear.

Sarge snapped his fingers in the doc’s face, “Hey, Doc. Focus. Haze. Good? Yes? No?”

The doctor seemed to come back to us and quickly said, “Yes, yes, a few days of rest and he will be fine. Maybe less given how quickly he’s healing.”

“Good. Will he need any further medical procedures?”

The doctor still had his eyes on the data collected from the machines. He was totally absorbed by what he was reading and off-handedly muttered, “No, no.” Then more to himself, “Unbelievable, the rate of cell division is just…” 

I was collecting my clothes and started getting dressed when I heard a sharp snap. I turned on my heels to see the doctor falling to the ground, his neck at an impossible angle. Sarge was standing next to him, looking impassively at the now dead doctor. 

“What the hell, Sarge?”

“It had to be done, Haze. No one can ever know that we can be harmed. We have to be absolute, untouchable, undefeatable. This is what the normies need us to be. This is what Terra needs us to be.”

I looked down at the dead doctor and wondered, ‘*What else is this war going to take from us?*’

“Purge all records of us being here, Specialist Haze.”

I snapped to attention and went to work deleting all info on my presence in medbay while Sarge folded the doc’s body into an impossibly small ball and shoved it down the hazmat shoot to be fed directly into the ship’s reactor.

He turned to me and asked, “Done?”

I nodded and the two of us left medbay. 



We were making our way to our quarters when two of the crew saw us and dragged us to the rec room. When we got there, there was one hell of a party going on. The rec room is a couple of twenty meters wide and about about hundred meters long but I don’t know how they did it but the entire crew of the Saratoga and the surviving ground troops managed to squeeze themselves in. We celebrated to the wee hours of the morning. During the party, I saw Sarge and the Captain talking seriously over drinks. I guess he was smoothing over what had happened in medbay. My attention was ripped away from the scene but one very pretty Lieutenant who dragged me to the middle of the room and dance, much to everyone’s delight. 

After that, the evening became a blur of drinks, music and partying. We had managed to defeat the bugs, on their territory no less. We had proved that ground deployment was a viable option. We had proved that SkyFall was technically and logistically possible. This was mission success. 

When I woke up the following day, I had one hell of a headache and was thankful we didn’t have another deployment in sight. I guess the brass needed time to see how the situation had changed now that we had struck the Bugs a major blow. The six of us were sitting at a table in the mess hall, nursing what the cook had promised us was coffee.

I heard Kitten ask one of the crew, “Any news on the *Saratoga?”*

The woman he had asked simply stated, *“*The *Saratoga* had been lost.”

Kitten looked crestfallen but the woman went on, “She isn’t the only ship we lost. The *Agammenon* was slagged. The *Morrigan* survived, just. She’s still venting atmo from what I heard. Most of the corvettes survived because they were nimble enough to avoid the plasma bolts from Bug ships. Out the hundred plus ships sent out to pick up the troops of Operation Skyfall only 36 survived.”

I quickly did the maths, every ship could hold about 40 to 50 troopers. If we had been on board, call it 30. Out of the 15,000 troops that went down into those tunnels, between 1,440 and 1,800 survived. 10%. Not good but better than the millions who fell when we weren’t sent.

I asked, “Any of the crew manage to get to the lifeboats?”

The woman shook her head and simply stated, “No.”

There wasn’t much left to be said after that. Kitten put his arm around the woman and hugged her. She seemed tense but, after a few seconds, she started sobbing. 

I looked at her and didn’t know what to do. Kitten looked as lost as I felt. 

The three of us sat at the table in silence for five minutes as the woman cried herself out. 

After five minutes, there was a call, “All Specialists, assemble in the briefing room. Repeat. All Specialists are to assemble in the briefing room.”

I started to move and heard Kitten say, “I need to go.”

As I briskly walked down the corridor to the briefing room, I heard Kitten’s footsteps right behind me. I looked back at him and chided, “Well, you’re popular.”

Kitten smiled and shrugged, “What can I say?”

As we made our way to the briefing room, Hasan joined us.

Kitten decided he was going to start an argument for being wrenched from his girl. I’m guessing that’s why he decided to pick a fight with Hasan. 

He simply said, “I wonder if we’re going to be sent to another world being bombarded by the Fleet.”

Hasan immediately responded, “We managed to achieve mission objectives.”

Kitten shrugged and said, “It still sucked that we had to deploy during a meteor strike. I mean, what was the tactical advantage?”

Hasan hesitated for a second which was unusual in itself. He took the time it took to turn the corner to the walkway to the briefing room to think, “Well, it also was a fact finding mission. Skyfall was some sort of proving ground. We had to prove Skyfall was actually feasible. Check. Was it possible for the Fleet to manage the resources to sustain orbital bombardment? Check. Was troop deployment possible during bombardment? Check. There are still questions that need answering though.”

Kitten listened stoically and again shrugged, “Well, still sucks being dropped during a meteor strike.”

Hasan shrugged back and replied, “It’s part of the job, Kitten.”

By the time we had got to briefing, Kitten and the Assassin were chatting about something else. Apparently, Hasan had found info about civi societies. He was reading some data slate about the state of civilian worlds.

“The loss of Terra was a blessing in a way.”

I looked at Hasan as if he had grown another head. This was so close to treason. I stopped in my tracks and bluntly said, “Explain.”

My hand had balled into a fist and I realised I was getting ready to strike him. 

He kept on walking, apparently ignorant of the effect he was having on me, “We have now a form of unity that has never been seen before. All talks of dissension has stopped, the trading wars between our worlds have disappeared. We are now one people, one mind, one goal.”

As I listened to him, I realised he was right. We had never been this united. There were stories in the news everyday of civi ships bringing aid to Holy Terra. Thousands of fleets from every world we had colonised were coming home, even pirate fleets. It really was as if all of Terra’s children had come home to be by her side. The cordon of life that had evacuated the people off of Holy Terra had now been replaced by these ships. They brought everything, anything that Holy Terra would need to bring her back to her former glory. 

I remember hearing of the first time the Golden Fleet had entered Terra’s system. They were infamous. Pirates. They gave no quarter, took no prisoners. They raided small outposts and colonies in impunity. They didn’t care if you were human or Xeno, as long as you had something they wanted, they would take it. They were an old group. Hell, my father had fought against them when he was a pilot. The Fleet had never managed to get their hands on them however. They usually jumped into system, raced through orbital defences, raided and then jumped out before anyone could react. In open space, they raided individual ships, boarding them and stripping them of anything useful. In occupied systems, they attacked in waves before retreating and coming back. Over and over and over until they had crippled those they were raiding. They were feared and hated. 

It had been a couple months ago, a day or two after Holy Terra had been struck. It would have made headline news but with the on-going war and the Fall of Terra, it went mostly unnoticed. That is until about fifty ships from breachers to destroyers and even a light cruiser showed up on the fringes of the systems. It had set off all alarms and the Fleet had been mustered. 

I was surprised that they hadn’t been shot out of the sky but, from what I read afterwards, the pirates had sent an envoy. Fednets had reported the entire exchange. Apparently, it went down something like this.

\-Whoever you are. This is Holy Space. Fuck off.

\-This is Admiral Nagata of the Golden Fleet. I am in the skiff approaching on vector 777. 

There was a pause. 

\-What do you want? 

\-We have heard Popess Chrystal XI’s summons and have to come to pledge ourselves to the defence of Holy Terra. 

\-What?!

\-We spend a lot of time in Xeno territory to avoid Federal patrols. We have detailed info on patrols, their routes, their numbers. I am here to offer that knowledge as well as the support of the Golden Fleet in the defence of Holy Terra 

\-… One moment.

…

\-Understand that if you twitch the wrong way, we will blow you out of the sky. 

\-Yes, Ma’am. 

\-Form up on Fleet Cerberus around Ganymede. 

  
I guess teaming up with pirates was ok then.

I’m desperate,"I am 20 I have had what I thought was chronic UTIs for about two years now since my second time of intercourse in my life I got a very bad uti I treated it felt fine and boom. Since then every single time I have intercourse it’s extreme bladder pain, urethra pain, cramping, burning during urination, and feeling like I need to pee to an extreme point but either barely anything comes out or nothing does. To the point where now I can go 2-3 weeks without intercourse and I’m still having symptoms randomly. I’ve been tested for UTIs, stds/stis, bv, and most the time I’m tested for UTIs it’s negative but once was e.faecalis at an urgent care. I went to a urogyno and was given long term post coital and it did absolutely nothing. I was taking dmmanose cranberry everything you can think of for prevention. There was one time I remember being in so much pain I was basically bed and toilet ridden crying just trying to pee cause it was the only relief I could get but I didn’t even need to pee and I had to wear 3 pads and double lined sweats to college class incase the pain was so unbearable again that I had to pee myself. This was about a year ago. 
I made an appointment with a urologist about 2 months ago and she believes I have overactive bladder which I used to rule out because I feel like I don’t pee very often and one of my questions is what are the symptoms? Can I have urethra pain and bladder pain that feel like uti and it be this? She has put me on a month of vesicare and it made it to where I could not pee at all I would have to stretch and maneuver to do it, she put me on half the dose now for 3 months and I’m still have issues. Currently after a weekend of intercourse I’m having intense bladder and urethra pain, after I just urinated it made my urethra burn ( is this a ovb symptom?) I notice worsening of symptoms with soda and coffee as well. I have been dealing with this for so long  that I can admit, I have lessened my water intake a huge amount way before I saw the urologist because I’m genuinely so depressed about my health and feeling this chronic pain that I’m tired of not getting to enjoy the little things like a doctor pepper because I know I’m gonna still feel pain if I don’t drink it. I need help or at-least some reassurance that this is overactive bladder and I’m not on the wrong path again. And please don’t tell me to trust the doctors or do not ask random people questions because I’ve been to plenty of doctors and I’m still at a loss. I’ve had the same partner throughout all of this. And when we began having intercourse for the first half of the year, we were using protection strictly and it all started there so I don’t believe it’s a partner issue and neither do any of the doctors I’ve seen. I also do have anxiety disorder and have since I can remember. But I didn’t have these issues until intercourse. ",1,1744796660.0,OveractiveBladder,0,1.0,False
1k0ggd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Majestic_Peach1953/comments/1k0ggd9/maximizing_small_spaces_creative_solutions_from/,Maximizing Small Spaces: Creative Solutions from Commercial Contractors in Singapore,"In a fast-growing city like Singapore, space is often a luxury — especially for businesses setting up shop in prime commercial districts. Whether you're planning a boutique retail store, a café, or a compact office, making the most of your square footage is essential for both function and style. This is where a trusted **commercial contractor Singapore** comes into play.

# Why Small Spaces Need Smart Planning

Limited space doesn’t have to limit potential. When designed correctly, even the smallest commercial properties can feel spacious, modern, and welcoming. Commercial contractors in Singapore understand local architecture challenges, tight building regulations, and — most importantly — how to transform underused areas into high-performing business environments.

# Creative Solutions from Experienced Contractors

# 1. Flexible Layouts and Multi-Purpose Zones

One of the top strategies used by a professional [commercial contractor Singapore](https://www.dbb.com/office-interior-design-singapore/) is designing multi-use areas. For example, a café can include movable partitions to switch between daytime coffee service and evening private events. This approach helps businesses maximize revenue from the same square footage.

# 2. Built-In Storage Solutions

In smaller commercial spaces, storage can quickly become a challenge. Commercial contractors often recommend built-in cabinets, floating shelves, and hidden storage under seating or counters to keep the environment clutter-free while maintaining accessibility.

# 3. Optimized Lighting Design

Good lighting can make a compact space feel much larger. Singapore contractors use a combination of natural light, layered artificial lighting, and mirrors to open up tight areas and create a welcoming ambiance.

# 4. Minimalist and Vertical Design

Another popular tactic is focusing on clean, minimalist interiors with vertical design elements. By using vertical storage, decorative wall installations, and high shelving, contractors help businesses free up precious floor space without sacrificing functionality.

# 5. Smart Material Selection

Choosing the right materials — like glass partitions, light-colored surfaces, and reflective flooring — helps make any room look brighter and more expansive. An experienced **commercial contractor Singapore** will guide you through this process to strike the right balance between aesthetics and practicality.

# The Value of Local Expertise

Working with a Singapore-based commercial contractor ensures your project stays compliant with URA regulations and building codes while delivering efficient and creative design solutions tailored to your business needs. Their local knowledge is invaluable, especially when dealing with space constraints, timeline pressure, and budget considerations.

# Conclusion

Maximizing small spaces isn’t just about clever furniture or minimalist design — it’s about working with the right experts who can transform limitations into opportunities. A skilled **commercial contractor Singapore** will help your business create an environment that feels larger, works smarter, and leaves a lasting impression on customers and employees alike.",1,1744796645.0,u_Majestic_Peach1953,0,1.0,False
1k0gg3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Total_Pickle_6745/comments/1k0gg3c/not_sure_how_to_feel/,Not sure how to feel,"Hello Reddit, I am a long-time reader but this is my first time posting.  I am not sure where to start but I think a little background information might be helpful for my situation.  After high school I took the basic route after high school and applied for college I did that and graduated with my bachelors in justice administration (paralegal) back in 2020. While I was coming my bachelors degree thankfully I was working in a law office and spent about 8 years working in that law office.  I had fun working for this law office I genuinely thought that I would be happy working as a paralegal, however as the years working for that office increased I began to see that I was losing my own time, that even when I came home I found myself still stressing about my law office work and even at time staying up until 3 in the morning still drafting and preparing documents for upcoming trials.  I had no real personal time of my own, this only increased when covid hit and now I had to work from home.  It was during this time that I started to see my life was fully being spent on work.  I woke up in the morning and straight into work then it would be late at night and I would still be working.  Losing time to take care of myself, be with friends and family time.  Realizing this I was not happy with the rest of my life going to be spent in my room constantly sitting in front of my computer, losing sleep at night worrying if I prepared my documents or files enough for my deadlines.  I believe that there are people out there that love the field of law and I thought I was one of them, but I could not handle the impact it was having on my health and my social life.  So I made the decision and discussed with my family that I wanted to quite my job and return to school to pursue and interested that I have had at the very beginning when making my decision in entering college which was to go into physical therapy.

My issue now is that when I had this discussion with my dad and grandma that I would need some support now that I have made my decision to return to school and pursue a field that is the complete opposite of my first degree.  I did save as much money as possible the 8 years I was working with my law office along side also working a coffee shop job for some additional cash.  However it was during my discussion with my grandma about my decision to return to school there was a shift in her attitude in that she began to make little comments of "" I told you from the beginning that you should have just gone into the medical field."" I get college was a time to explore really what peaks my interest and I genuinely thought that going into the field of law was what I was interested in.  However seeing the toll it was taking on me mentally and physically I was not happy.  That going into physically therapy I am given the chance to really work a specified hours, I can make a clear line of work stays at work, I will be more active and moving around being a physical therapist and not basically sitting in front of a computer for almost 24 hours a day.

Being back in college I get I am a bit older than the rest of my classmates, but learning the physical therapy field I am having a lot of fun I am making a lot of connections my advisors in my college and professors are all share their own experience of PT and I can't help but just feel so excited everyday in class and learning everything about what as PT does.  I am doing what I need to do in school making sure I am passing my classes and understanding the material, but as of lately my grandma has been constantly saying comments to me of ""hurry up you are so old; can you just do what you need to do"" I get that I am living under her roof but I do my fair share around the house, I go out buy groceries, I clean up the house, I help manage her business and when ever there is a family ""emergency"" I am always the one to stop what I am doing and come running to help.  I get it I am older than most of my classmates but today when I went to tell her an update on getting an internship position at a rehab hospital and being part of a study dealing with physical therapy and cancer patients she just told me"" you are old hurry up what ever you need to pay just do it"" now mind you that the grocery shopping I do I don't get any repayment back, and my tuition for the past 2 years I have been back at school I have been paying out of my own pocket no help from my grnadma or dad and I am not currently working.

I just wanted to update her of the hard work that I have been doing and just wanted to ask for some financial help now going into my final semester of this new degree and again it is just constant comments of my age and that my grandma is providing everything for me.  I don't know what I am suppose to do, when my other cousins talk to her about their situations and ask her for financial help with college she will easily provide how ever much they need, but with everything I do for my grandma, it does not seem like I am given the time of day.  I am honestly just feeling neglect? or frustrated? I am honestly not sure. I am trying my best to finish quickly but you cant speed up how fast a college education is taught I am already handling 6 classes all at once.  i don't know reddit, is this all my fault for not getting it right the first time going to college? that I should not be even asking my family for a small financial assistance?  Not really sure what kind of responses I want from you reddit community but I guess I just really needed to vent.  Not sure if this post made any sense but I think just writing it all out the way I am feeling just kind of makes me feel better or worse I cant tell what emotion I am feeling right now.",1,1744796610.0,u_Total_Pickle_6745,0,1.0,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The La Spaziale espresso machine range boasts an array of advanced features designed to elevate the espresso-making experience. From precise temperature control to user-friendly interfaces, these machines are built for both performance and longevity.

**Saturated Group Head:** La Spaziale machines typically feature saturated group heads, ensuring exceptional temperature stability.

A Saturated group head means that the brewing group is directly integrated into the boiler, keeping it at a consistent temperature. This reduces temperature fluctuations during the brewing process, leading to more consistent and predictable espresso extraction. The consistent temperature is critical for bringing out the best flavors and aromas in the coffee beans, and for minimizing bitter or sour notes.

**Dual Boiler System:** Many La Spaziale models include a dual boiler system, allowing for simultaneous brewing and steaming.

This dual boiler configuration provides independent temperature control for both the espresso brewing and milk steaming functions. This eliminates the need to wait for the machine to re-heat between brewing and steaming, making it ideal for preparing multiple beverages quickly. The separate boilers also prevent temperature fluctuations that can occur when a single boiler is used for both tasks, resulting in better flavor and texture.

**Electronic Temperature Control (PID):** Precise temperature management is crucial for consistent espresso extraction.

La Spaziale uses PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers to maintain precise temperature within the boilers and group heads. PID controllers constantly monitor the temperature and make minute adjustments to the heating elements, ensuring that the water is always at the optimal temperature for brewing and steaming. This precise temperature control translates to more consistent espresso shots with improved flavor and aroma.

**Volumetric Dosing:** Consistent shot volumes are essential for replicating desired results.

Volumetric dosing allows the user to program the machine to dispense a specific amount of water for each espresso shot. This feature eliminates the guesswork involved in manually pulling shots, ensuring that each shot is consistent in terms of volume and extraction time. The programmed volumes can be easily adjusted to accommodate different coffee beans and desired flavor profiles.

**Pre-Infusion:** Gentle pre-wetting of the coffee grounds enhances flavor extraction.

The pre-infusion feature gently wets the coffee grounds before the full brewing pressure is applied. This allows the coffee grounds to bloom and release trapped gases, resulting in a more even extraction and improved flavor clarity. La Spaziale machines often offer adjustable pre-infusion settings, allowing the user to fine-tune the extraction process to their specific preferences.

Key features of La Spaziale espresso machines include:
* Consistent temperature stability
* High-quality construction
* User-friendly interfaces
* Precise control over brewing parameters

 ## FAQs Section

**What type of water filtration system is recommended for La Spaziale machines?**

A High-quality water filtration system is essential for protecting La Spaziale machines from scale buildup and ensuring optimal espresso quality. A water softener is particularly important in areas with hard water. Reverse osmosis systems can also be used, but it's important to remineralize the water to prevent corrosion of the machine's internal components.

**How often should La Spaziale machines be professionally serviced?**

Professional servicing is recommended at least once a year, or more frequently depending on usage. Regular servicing helps to maintain the machine's performance, prevent breakdowns, and extend its lifespan. A qualified technician can inspect and clean the machine's internal components, replace worn parts, and calibrate the brewing parameters.

**Are La Spaziale machines suitable for both home and commercial use?**

La Spaziale offers a range of machines designed for both home and commercial use. Their commercial-grade machines are built to withstand the demands of a busy cafe environment, while their home models offer similar features and performance in a smaller, more affordable package. The appropriate model will depend on the intended usage and the volume of espresso drinks being prepared.

1k0gdcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1k0gdcf/guys_of_gilmore_girls_lorelai/,Guys of Gilmore Girls (Lorelai),"Max:

This relationship moved too fast. Lorelai definitely wasn’t truly ready for a committed relationship or to bring someone into hers and Rory’s lives. I think Max wanted a family so he pushed to move things along quickly. Though his proposal was sweet and he gave her what she wanted with all the daisies and he picked the ring she wanted. 

Jason:

I feel like this one was doomed from the start. Jason was the arrogant and rude business guy when you first meet him. He was also way more her parents world than I think she ever would have chosen. The sneaking around seemed ridiculous and very high school. But I think they could have been good friends if the whole Richard betrayal never happened. 

Guy from class:

This one just seemed like the writers wanted a joke. Like he seemed smart and nice when you first see him at the school but then he shows up in Stars Hollow and he’s immature. I don’t get what happened there. 

Rune:

Lmao 😂 he was so rude and insecure. 

Kirk 😂:

Love Kirk. His and Lorelai’s friendship or whatever you want to call it was funny. 

Alex:

I really liked him and wanted to see more Billy Burke in this show. I think him and Lorelai would have been really good together. Both of them had a love of coffee and he even took her to a coffee tasting as a sort of first date. I liked how he added a spa visit to the fishing trip since he didn’t think fishing was really her thing. Wish we got to see this one develop but instead his character just seemed to vanish. 

Luke:

People are definitely gonna hate me here. I apologize in advance to all the Luke and Lorelai fans. 

At first I really did like Luke and Lorelai and was hoping for them to get together. He was grumpy and but sweet to her and Rory. Seemed like he could help balance her in a way. However, the more I watch the show I can’t help but see how toxic this relationship is. Yes, Luke did more for Lorelai than any friend likely  would have and he was there for her more than most people. But he also had a short fuse, was horrible at communicating, and physically aggressive (not towards Lorelai but towards others). He attacked Dean (a teenager at the time) after the breakup with Rory, then there was the bop-it night incident. He punched Christopher (I get why but still not really necessary). When Lorelai tried to give advice about Jess he snapped at her, he snapped at her again after the car accident but that one I don’t blame him for since he was worried about Jess. I don’t like how he handled the April situation. You need time to process that’s fine but you don’t hide things from the person you are about to marry and claim to love. Then to call off the wedding and keep her away from April until he realizes he’s out of his depth with a girls birthday party, like nope go call April’s mother for help. He got mad at her for the incident at the wedding renewal and was super insecure with her having any interaction with Chris (though partially her fault for trying to hide his phone call), but Chris was Rory’s dad and to some extent they would have been in contact if they were going to co-parent. Also, in AYITL how the heck have they not discussed children by that point?

Christopher:

Okay so I don’t think he was the absolute worst person in the world, he definitely had flaws. Was he an absent father for Rory? Yes. Though I have wondered how much of that was caused by Lorelai running away with Rory and hiding from her parents. We know he was in and out of their lives in the first season though so idk. For most of the show they made it seem like he didn’t know what he wanted always trying to do what others thought would be the right choice. Marry Lorelai/Sherri because they were having a baby (not always the answer sir). Him and Lorelai were back and forth and never seemed to be on the same page. He definitely over compensated when it came to Gigi and then got mad at Lorelai for calling her spoiled. Though to be fair most parents in his situation would probably get mad when someone calls their child spoiled and they are trying their best. He was insecure about Luke, can’t blame him there though, Luke was supposed to be Lorelai’s great love and she was hiding things from Chris. Plus he lived in a town where Luke was basically the center and all the people that were supposed to be friendly/inviting didn’t really try to befriend him. Ultimately I’m pretty sure they should have stayed friends and co-parents. 

I don’t think she needed to be with either Luke or Chris, yes she loved them and yes they were there for her when she needed them. But I don’t think either were really the best. Perhaps there should have been someone new, or maybe even Alex 😂. 

What do you think? Probably missed some things since I was trying to condense a lot of stuff. Be kind. ❤️",0,1744796284.0,GilmoreGirls,0,0.25,False

For over two hundred years, I was the “thing you don’t talk about after dark,” and suddenly I’m content? An episode? Discussed between coffee sips and Ryan’s trembling optimism.

I’ll be honest, I wasn’t expecting much.
People forget me all the time. Until the wind hits wrong. Until a house creaks in just the right rhythm. Until someone says “The Bell Witch” like it’s a punchline instead of a warning.

But then I heard you two. And look, I tried not to care. Really. I had better things to do.

I was mid-haunting. There was a mirror fogging up beautifully. Timing was impeccable. But no, you had to go and say my name. Repeatedly. 🙄

Ryan.
Sweetheart. You spent most of the episode sounding like you were about five seconds away from bursting into prayer. It was adorable. I felt seen. 🥰

Shane.
You absolute walking brick wall of disbelief.
You smirked at me. You called it “poison” like that’s less spooky than me slowly unraveling a man’s life because I felt like it. The audacity.
You’re lucky I like a challenge. 😉

And then the theories.
“She was angry.”
Yes. Correct.
“Maybe it was grief. Or folklore. Or fear given shape.”
Oh, so now you’re poets?

I’m a voice in the dark and the thing you pretend not to hear. I’m every ignored woman who got tired of being polite. And now I’m on your show. So congrats, I guess?

You didn’t get it all right, but whatever, you tried. Gold star for effort.⭐️

Next time, say my name with a little more respect. Or don’t. I love a dramatic entrance.

See you soon. Or not.
(You’ll know if I show up.)

Yours in eerie noises and petty vengeance,

Kate — The Bell Witch. Not your content. Not your closure.

1k0gb2z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k0gb2z,Hi all. New here. Some questions if you have a second,"  Im 5'9. Started at 252 pounds.   I had a trainer. And it's such a long story.    Long story short, I wasn't seeing results as fast as I'd like. Body composition was changing and stronger.  However I'm seeking fat loss.  

  I was eating around 2300 calories a day. All throughout day.   I've now introduced fasting 

For the last 2 weeks, I've eaten and drank VERY light. Less than 200 calories during day. Then at night, one big meal.   Under 1700 a day. 

  Now, today, I started what I guess is considered OMAD?  Just finished a 20 hour fast.  Eating the next 4 hours. Trying not to go over 1500 calories. 

I actually am down to 244.8 after 2 weeks.  Granted probably ALL water weight.  But ate less than 1700 a day for 2 weeks


  I guess my questions are...... (try to word as well as possible)

The hunger pains.  They're real. I'm hungry in the 20 hours.  I chugged a gallon of water today. Drank some black coffee. But still, very hungry.   Will that go away?  I feel very tired too.  Like no energy.   

  I am doing a lot of cardio now, unlike before where lifting was prevelant. Im doing some lifting but mainly cardio. 


  Just any advice would be good. My friend lost A LOT OF WEIGHT doing this. And I'm the most committed person you'll meet. So if this'll make me get down to about 200, im ecstatic.  I track and weigh all my food

1k0gakm,https://www.reddit.com/r/richmaturemen/comments/1k0gakm/meeting_50yearold_women_online_smart_intentional/,"Meeting 50-Year-Old Women Online: Smart, Intentional, and Effective","In today’s digitally driven world, meeting someone online is not only normal—it’s often the most practical and effective way to connect with someone who aligns with your values, interests, and lifestyle. For those [interested in dating 50-year-old women, the online space opens up a world of opportunity to meet confident, grounded, and emotionally mature individuals](http://ConnectRich.com).

Contrary to outdated assumptions, many women over 50 are highly active online. They're not only tech-savvy but also open to finding love, friendship, and companionship in a modern way. Whether they’re divorced, widowed, or simply never settled down, women in this age group are often at a point in life where they know what they want and aren’t afraid to pursue it, with grace and intention.

But how you show up online makes all the difference. Meeting 50-year-old women online isn’t about flashy profiles or chasing after likes. It’s about sincerity, presence, and emotional intelligence. Here’s how to do it right.

# Choose the Right Platform—It Sets the Tone

Not all dating platforms are created equal. If you're serious about meeting mature women, you’ll want to choose a site or app that attracts people in that same stage of life—emotionally ready, looking for real connections, and uninterested in casual flings or games.

**OurTime** is a dating site specifically designed for people over 50. Its interface is easy to navigate, and it attracts a large, diverse pool of users who are looking for everything from friendship to serious relationships.

**SilverSingles** is another strong option. With a focus on compatibility, it uses a detailed personality test to match people based on shared values and long-term goals. It’s ideal for those who want something meaningful and lasting.

If you’re interested in connecting with women who are also accomplished, career-minded, or financially independent, **EliteSingles** or **eHarmony** might be a better fit. These sites cater to professionals and those looking for deep, value-based connections.

And for those interested in dating within affluent circles—or meeting elegant, high-value women—**ConnectRich.org** offers a refined, discreet environment for those looking to build a relationship that includes emotional, romantic, and lifestyle compatibility.

Your choice of platform speaks volumes. When you join a space that aligns with your values, it not only increases your chances of meeting the right person, it also sends a signal that you’re intentional about what you’re seeking.

# Build a Profile That Feels Real and Inviting

Think of your dating profile as your first conversation. It’s your chance to show not just who you are, but how you live, what you care about, and how you approach relationships. Women in their 50s tend to be attracted to substance over style. Your words matter. Your tone matters. The vibe you give off through your profile could be what draws someone in or pushes them away.

Start with strong, **recent photos**. You don’t need a professional photo shoot (unless you want to!), but your pictures should reflect the current, confident, real-life version of yourself. Avoid using old pictures from ten years ago. You want someone to be attracted to *you*, not who you used to be.

Your main profile photo should be well-lit, friendly, and authentic. Bonus points if you’re smiling or doing something you love—whether it’s walking your dog, enjoying a weekend trip, or simply relaxing with a coffee.

When writing your **bio**, avoid clichés. Instead of “I love to laugh” (which most people do), say something like, “My friends describe me as thoughtful and funny, and I’m happiest when I’m near the ocean with a good book and a glass of wine.” These small, specific details paint a richer picture and help women see how they might fit into your life.

Be clear about your **intentions**. If you’re looking for a long-term relationship, say so. If you’re open to connection and want to see where it leads, that’s fine too. Just don’t be vague or misleading. Women over 50 often appreciate directness. They've been through enough to know what works and what doesn’t.

# Master the Art of the First Message

So you’ve found someone who catches your eye—now what? Your first message is your opportunity to make a thoughtful impression. Avoid one-word greetings like “Hi” or generic lines like “How are you?” These kinds of messages rarely stand out, and they don't give her anything to respond to.

Instead, **read her profile carefully**. Look for something unique—maybe she mentioned a favorite travel destination, a hobby, or a cause she’s passionate about. Then, start with something like:

>

Or:

>

These kinds of openers show that you’re attentive, respectful, and genuinely interested, not just sending out copy-paste messages to anyone who looks attractive.

Also, don’t rush the conversation. Women in their 50s tend to value *connection over speed*. They want someone who listens, asks thoughtful questions, and shares without oversharing. Let the conversation unfold naturally.

# Build Trust with a Video or Phone Chat

Before meeting in person, many women over 50 prefer a video or phone call. It’s not just about safety—it’s about *comfort*. A short video call can help you both see if there’s chemistry, conversation flow, and emotional alignment.

Don’t be afraid to suggest it. Say something casual and respectful like:

>

This step builds trust and breaks the ice, so when you do meet in person, it feels much more relaxed and familiar.

# Plan the Right First Date—Thoughtful and Relaxed

When you’re ready to meet in person, think quality over flash. Women in this age group are often more interested in intimacy and good conversation than in over-the-top gestures.

Pick a place where you can talk and enjoy each other’s company—like a cozy café, a quiet wine bar, a walk in a scenic park, or a museum. Avoid loud restaurants or high-stress environments. Keep the date under two hours so there’s room for curiosity to grow without overwhelming either of you.

And most importantly—**be present**. Put your phone away, listen more than you speak, and be authentic. The way you treat her during that first meeting will set the tone for everything that follows.

# Approach Online Dating with the Right Mindset

Online dating, especially with mature women, is not a numbers game—it’s a *connection game*. Be patient. Not every conversation will lead to romance, and that’s okay. Each interaction is a chance to practice being real, respectful, and open to possibility.

You’re not just looking for someone who looks good on paper—you’re looking for someone whose heart, values, and energy align with yours. That kind of connection can’t be rushed. But when it happens, it’s worth everything.

# Conclusion: A New Era of Love and Connection

[Dating in your 50s—or dating someone who is—can be more fulfilling, exciting, and emotionally mature than ever before](http://ConnectRich.com). Women in this age group bring strength, warmth, and wisdom to their relationships. They’re not looking to be rescued or impressed—they’re looking to be respected, appreciated, and emotionally met.

By approaching online dating with clear intention, emotional presence, and genuine interest, you give yourself the best possible chance to find not just a partner but a deeply meaningful relationship.

The internet has brought us closer than ever before. With a little courage, the right platform, and a touch of curiosity, your next great connection might be just a message away.

I was a barista many, maaaaany years ago. Now I just drink the stuff. 

So believe it or not, iced coffee has only recently taken off here in New Zealand. Crazy, right?! 

I've become a big fan of iced latte with oat milk. On a hot day, it really hits the spot. 

Thing is, standards and procedures are still very varied across various cafes. Eg, a lukewarm coffee with a couple of ice cubes floating in it is an all-too-common crime against all good things. 

The process I think works best is: fill the cup with ice. Add (preferably cold milk), then, and only then, pull the shot. That gives the milk time to get really nice and cold before the shot hits. 

This seems most logical to me, but I just wanted to check with the professionals in case there's a better way of doing it.

But with so many fasting methods out there, how do you know which one is right for you? And what are the real benefits beyond weight loss?

In this **complete guide**, we’ll break down:

✅ **Top 5 Intermittent Fasting Methods** (from beginner to advanced)

✅ **Science-Backed Benefits** (weight loss, autophagy, longevity)

✅ **What to Eat & Avoid** (meal ideas for each fasting style)

✅ **Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them**

✅ **Who Should** **No** Try Fasting?

Let’s dive in!



**Top 5 Intermittent Fasting Methods (Ranked from Easiest to Hardest)**

**1. The 16/8 Method (Best for Beginners)**

**How It Works:**

* **Fast for 16 hours** , eat within an **8-hour window** (e.g., 12 PM–8 PM).
* Most people skip breakfast and have lunch as their first meal.

**Why It Works:**

* Mimics natural fasting cycles (overnight + a few extra hours).
* Boosts fat burning without extreme hunger.
* Easy to maintain long-term.

**Sample Eating Schedule:**

* **12 PM:** Big salad with chicken, avocado, and olive oil.
* **3 PM:** Greek yogurt + nuts.
* **6 PM:** Grilled salmon + roasted veggies.
* **7:45 PM:** Dark chocolate (85% cocoa).

**Pro Tip:** Drink black coffee or herbal tea in the morning to curb hunger.

**2. The 5:2 Diet (Flexible Fasting)**

**How It Works:**

* Eat normally for **5 days**.
* On **2 non-consecutive days**, eat only **500–600 calories**.

**Why It Works:**

*  No daily fasting—just two low-calorie days.
* Still effective for weight loss and insulin sensitivity.

**What to Eat on Fasting Days:**

* **Breakfast:** Black coffee + 1 boiled egg.(80 Cal.)
* **Lunch:** Veggie soup (150 Cal).
* **Dinner:** Grilled fish + steamed broccoli (300 Cal).

**Watch Out For:** Overeating on normal days—stick to whole foods!

**3. Eat-Stop-Eat (24-Hour Fast)**

**How It Works:**

* Pick **1–2 days per week** and fast for a full **24 hours** (e.g., dinner to dinner).

**Why It Works:**

* Triggers **autophagy** (cellular cleanup for anti-aging).
*  Deep fat-burning mode.

**How to Survive It:**

* Stay busy (fasting is easier when distracted).
* Drink electrolytes (salt + water) to avoid headaches.
* Break the fast with a light meal (bone broth → protein + veggies).

**Best For:** Experienced fasters looking for deep metabolic benefits.

**4. Alternate-Day Fasting (Rapid Weight Loss)**

**How It Works:**

* Fast **every other day** (either zero calories or 500 Cal).

**Why It Works:**

*  Forces the body to burn fat aggressively.
* Improves insulin resistance quickly.

**Downside:**

* Hard to maintain socially.
* Risk of muscle loss if protein intake is too low.

**Sample Eating Schedule for Fast Day:**

* **Morning:** Black coffee.
* **Afternoon:** Cucumber + lemon water.
* **Evening:** Small portion of grilled chicken + spinach.

**5. Warrior Diet (20/4 or OMAD for Advanced Fasters)**

**How It Works:**

* Fast for **20 hours**, eat **one big meal (or two small meals) in 4 hours.**

**Why It Works:**

*  Mimics ancient warrior eating patterns.
*  Sharpens mental clarity and fat adaptation.

**What to Eat in Your Window:**

**Protein**: Steak, salmon, eggs.

* **Healthy Fats:** Avocado, olive oil, nuts.
* **Fiber:** Leafy greens, broccoli, quinoa.

**Avoid:** Sugary or processed foods—they’ll spike insulin and make fasting harder.



**Science-Backed Benefits of Intermittent Fasting**

**1. Weight Loss & Fat Burning**

* IF lowers insulin, forcing the body to burn stored fat.
* Studies show **3–8% weight loss** in 3–24 weeks (without calorie counting!).

**2. Autophagy (Anti-Aging & Cellular Repair)**

* After \~18+ hours of fasting, your body cleans out damaged cells.
* Linked to **longevity** and reduced inflammation.

**3. Better Brain Function**

* Increases **BDNF** (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which improves memory and learning.
* May lower Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s risk.

**4. Improved Insulin Sensitivity**

* Lowers blood sugar and reduces **type 2 diabetes risk.**
* One study showed **fasting blood sugar dropped by 3–6%** (about 1–3 months)

**5. Heart Health**

* Reduces LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and inflammation.



 **Who Should Avoid Intermittent Fasting?**

*  Pregnant or breastfeeding women.
*  People with a history of **eating disorders.**
* Underweight individuals or those with nutrient deficiencies.
*  Diabetics (consult a doctor first—fasting can affect meds).



**Common Fasting Mistakes (And How to Fix Them)**

**Mistake 1: Eating Junk Food in Your Window**

* **Fix:** Stick to whole foods (protein, healthy fats, fiber).

**Mistake 2: Not Drinking Enough Water**

* **Fix:** Hydrate with water, electrolytes, black coffee, or herbal tea.

**Mistake 3: Going Too Hard Too Fast**

* **Fix:** Start with **12-hour fasts**, then gradually increase.

**Mistake 4: Ignoring Hunger Signals**

* **Fix:** If you feel dizzy or weak, **eat**—fasting should feel sustainable.



 **Final Thoughts: Which Method Should You Choose?**

* **Beginner?** Try **16/8.**
* **Want flexibility?** Try **5:2.**
* **Advanced?** Try **Eat-Stop-Eat or OMAD.**

**Key to Success: Consistency + listening to your body.**

I’ve been on Ozempic but honestly, I kept getting scared and stopping, so I wasn’t very consistent. Now I’ve been back on it and currently on 0.50 mg. I haven’t really noticed any major changes or effects yet, but I’m trying to be patient and give it more time.

I also recently bought MCT oil for energy and maybe appetite control. I’m not doing keto, just watching calories. I was thinking of adding 1 tsp of MCT oil to my morning coffee.

Has anyone tried that while on Ozempic?
	•	Did it affect nausea or digestion?
	•	Did it actually help with energy or feeling full?
	•	Is it a waste if I’m not doing keto?

T50, median grades. Big market (Chicago/NYC/SF)

I’ve “networked” all throughout law school without any substantive outcome (not just doing occasional coffee chats, but actually forming relationships). 

By some miracle, I’ve managed to get into a circle of people who are actually wealthy+has connections (I’m talking co-founders/CEOs of private equity firms, surgeons, big law counsels and partners, etc). They’re offering to help with my job search by utilizing their network and introducing me to their contacts at firms. 

My questions are:
1. Is this any different from my previous networking efforts?
2. If so, what do I do to actually land a job?

As a first gen, you always hear about all those kids who have “connections” and the importance of “networking” but I’m honestly a little lost on both concepts. My school’s OCS is useless, unless you have above median grades and other prestigious credentials.

Its one thing to know and pray this but I'm trying to live this out.

I can't tell if I'm being convicted by the Holy Spirit or just feeling guilty. I think its a mix of both.

I work from home most days and its honestly quite easy for me to do the bare minimum. Right now we are kind of in a transition stage at work so there isn't 8 hours of work for me to do. I can do what needs to get done in 1-3 hours. No-one has complained about me. I've asked for feedback about my performance and everyone says I'm doing well. No complaints. 

More than that I would say my strengths are being efficient and strategic in my work. I'm quite good at implementing ideas that work well and save time.

My co-worker is very energetic, loves work and will happily pick up any slack I leave behind. For the most part, she is the first to jump on a task that needs to get done. She hasn't complained and I've asked her point blank to let me know if you want me to help out more. 90% of the time she says she's fine and I kid you not she has told me she drinks 6-8 cups of coffee per day. 

When I sought advice from friends and other people they said, you are going to feel lazy compared to someone with that much energy. That being said I've learned from her, and try to adopt her enthusiasm but I also think we complement each other nicely and its not about me changing who I am.

Where things get interesting is that I received a prophetic word about starting a business - which was true. Ironically, I got my current job (fixed term 2 year contract) because I talked about what I've been working on. I know God positioned me in this job to help me develop certain people skills and financial stability that are needed for me to develop my current business. Now the temptation is to use the remaining time in the work day working on other things.

To add to this I'm also in a position at work where I can take the chance to learn and grow and develop new skills from other teams and in a way take on more work. But there's also part of me that just wants to do the work I'm being paid to do. ",2,1744794100.0,TrueChristian,0,1.0,False

I am by no means the perfect friend. My life is busy, I'm not always great at reaching out, but I also am often the only one who ever does. Just this week I have had one friend cancel coffee and the other fail to even reply. I have a feeling that I won't see them unless I again reach out and try to arrange something. I made a connection with someone last year who felt so on my wavelength, yet after a few months she literally fell off the map. I checked in on her, said I was here if she needed someone. Nothing. She did, text my husband back, which hurt me greatly. I had a best friend that I moved away from, and eventually stopped making so much effort to stay in contact with. She had a baby and it took four years to meet them, despite knowing she had holidayed nearby and not bothered to tell me.

1k0fqtu,https://i.redd.it/z193xny1v5ve1.png,Bitcoin Speculation: Boon or Bubble?,"*As Bitcoin hits new highs, investors weigh the risks behind the hype*

# A Record-Breaking Rally

Bitcoin is once again making headlines after climbing to **$86,000**, reigniting debates over whether the world’s largest cryptocurrency is in the middle of a historic run—or teetering on the edge of another crash. Driven by institutional interest, growing acceptance, and macroeconomic factors like inflation hedging, Bitcoin has gained nearly **30%** in just the past month.

But as prices soar, so do concerns.

# Speculative Frenzy or Strategic Investment?

The line between investment and speculation is blurring fast. Traditional investors point to growing adoption by corporations and ETFs as a sign of Bitcoin’s maturation. Yet critics argue that much of the current rally is fueled by **hype, FOMO (fear of missing out)**, and short-term trading.

“Bitcoin has become a speculative asset, not because it lacks value, but because most people are buying it with the hope that someone else will pay more tomorrow,” said one market analyst.

# Retail Traders and the Volatility Game

Retail investors continue to flood into the market, drawn by social media buzz and viral success stories. However, Bitcoin remains notoriously volatile. Just days after reaching $86K, it dropped to **$83,670**, wiping out billions in market cap overnight.

The high-stakes nature of the asset means big wins—but also dramatic losses. For many traders, the appeal lies less in Bitcoin’s technological innovation and more in its potential to deliver quick returns.

# Institutional Support: A Double-Edged Sword

The recent surge is partially credited to **institutional buying** from publicly traded companies, hedge funds, and even retirement portfolios. While this adds credibility and capital to the market, it also raises the stakes. A major exit by any large player could trigger a domino effect across exchanges.

“Institutions can both stabilize and destabilize the market, depending on their motivations,” said a blockchain economist. “If they’re only here for short-term gains, that’s a red flag.”

# Make Bitcoin Spendable: Use It with [**Spendo.com**](http://Spendo.com)

For those looking to actually **use** their Bitcoin rather than just speculate on its value, platforms like [**Spendo.com**](https://www.spendo.com/) are changing the game. With Spendo, users can **buy Bitcoin directly** and **link it to a Visa card**, making it easy to spend crypto for everyday purchases—**both online and in-store**.

This bridges the gap between crypto and real-world usability, allowing holders to use their Bitcoin like cash without needing to convert it manually. Whether it's groceries, gadgets, or your morning coffee—your BTC can now work for you instantly, just like fiat.

# Is Bitcoin Still the Future?

Despite the speculative frenzy, many still believe Bitcoin has long-term value as a **decentralized, deflationary store of value**, especially in times of fiat currency instability. Others argue that the real innovation now lies in the broader crypto ecosystem—like smart contracts and tokenized assets—while Bitcoin remains a volatile relic of the past.

Ultimately, whether Bitcoin’s current rally is a **stepping stone to mass adoption** or another chapter in speculative mania remains to be seen. But one thing’s for sure: the crypto rollercoaster isn't slowing down anytime soon.",1,1744793562.0,u_spendopay,0,1.0,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The ideal get well gift basket for a man should contain items that are practical, comforting, and tailored to his interests and needs. These features can significantly impact the basket's overall effectiveness in providing support and encouragement during recovery.

**Variety of Snacks and Drinks:** A great get well basket needs a selection of nourishing and tasty treats. Think beyond sugary snacks and consider healthier options like nuts, dried fruits, trail mix, and whole-grain crackers. Include comforting beverages like herbal teas, high-quality coffee, or even electrolyte-rich drinks to help with hydration. The variety ensures that there's something to appeal to his taste, regardless of his appetite during recovery.

**Comfort Items:** Recovery can be uncomfortable, so including items that promote relaxation is essential. A soft blanket, a comfortable eye mask, or even a neck pillow can make a significant difference. Consider items made from breathable materials like cotton or fleece to maximize comfort. These items provide a sense of warmth and security, contributing to a more restful recovery.

**Entertainment and Distraction:** Boredom can be a major obstacle during recovery. Include items that provide entertainment and distraction, such as a puzzle book, a deck of cards, a new book (consider his favorite genre), or a subscription to a streaming service. These items help to pass the time and take his mind off his discomfort. Digital options like audiobooks or e-books are also great additions for easy access.

**Personal Care Products:** Gentle and soothing personal care products are a thoughtful addition to a get well basket. Opt for unscented or lightly scented lotions, lip balms, and hand sanitizers. Include a soft toothbrush and toothpaste for maintaining oral hygiene. These items demonstrate care and attention to his basic needs, promoting a sense of well-being.

**Practical Tools and Gadgets:** Incorporating practical tools and gadgets can make the basket more useful and appealing. A multi-tool, a high-quality water bottle, or a portable phone charger can be valuable additions. These items provide a sense of utility and can be used long after the recovery period. Select items that align with his interests and hobbies.

 ## Core Benefits

A well-chosen get well gift basket for a man can provide numerous benefits beyond simply being a thoughtful gesture. It can contribute to his overall well-being and recovery process.

**Emotional Uplift:** Receiving a thoughtfully curated get well gift basket can significantly boost morale and combat feelings of isolation or depression during recovery. The act of giving shows that someone cares and is thinking about him, providing a sense of connection and support. This positive emotional impact can contribute to a more optimistic outlook and faster healing.

**Reduced Stress and Anxiety:** Recovery can be a stressful time, filled with uncertainty and discomfort. The contents of a get well basket can help reduce stress and anxiety by providing comfort, entertainment, and practical assistance. Items like relaxation aids, distractions, and personal care products can create a more calming and supportive environment.

**Promoted Self-Care:** A get well gift basket encourages self-care during a time when it's most needed. It provides the tools and resources for him to prioritize his comfort, relaxation, and hygiene. This focus on self-care can contribute to a faster and more complete recovery. It reminds him to take care of himself during a challenging period.

**Improved Recovery:** By providing nourishment, comfort, and entertainment, a well-chosen get well gift basket can indirectly contribute to improved recovery outcomes. Good nutrition, stress reduction, and mental stimulation all play a role in the healing process. The basket provides the means to support these essential aspects of recovery.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about get well gift baskets for men:

**What are some good alternatives to food items in a get well basket?**

Consider including non-food items like a gift certificate to his favorite streaming service, a comfortable pair of socks, or a high-quality journal and pen. These items can provide entertainment, comfort, and a creative outlet during recovery. Focus on items that cater to his interests and hobbies.

**How can I personalize a get well gift basket for a man?**

Personalize the basket by including items that reflect his specific interests, hobbies, or needs. For example, if he enjoys reading, include a book by his favorite author. If he's a sports fan, include team-branded merchandise. Adding a handwritten card with a personal message is also a great way to personalize the gift.

**What if the recipient has dietary restrictions or allergies?**

Carefully consider any dietary restrictions or allergies before selecting food items for the basket. Opt for items that are gluten-free, dairy-free, or nut-free as needed. Clearly label all food items with ingredient information to ensure the recipient's safety. If you're unsure, it's best to err on the side of caution and choose non-food alternatives.

1k0foe5,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1k0foe5/not_every_hobby_needs_to_be_monetized_its_okay_to/,Not every hobby needs to be monetized — it's okay to just do things for fun without turning them into a 'side hustle.,"I know this is going to ruffle some feathers, but here’s my unpopular opinion: not everything you enjoy doing needs to be turned into a business. Not every hobby needs to become a brand, a source of passive income, or a personal “journey” to be documented online. Sometimes, it’s okay to just... enjoy things. In private. For fun.

We’ve become so entrenched in hustle culture that we’ve forgotten it’s *fine* to be mediocre at something — to paint badly, to write messy poetry, to bake lumpy muffins, or to play an instrument without any intention of performing. Not everything has to lead somewhere. There doesn't need to be a five-year plan for your crocheting.

Take YouTube or TikTok for example. You’ll see someone say, “I picked up embroidery during quarantine,” and before you know it, they’re launching an Etsy store, filming tutorials, starting a Patreon, and getting burnout six months later. What happened to just stitching a cute mushroom patch on a jacket and calling it a day?

It’s especially rough when people *feel bad* for not monetizing their interests — like if you don’t try to “capitalize” on your hobby, you’re somehow wasting your time. No. Time spent doing something you enjoy is not time wasted. Even if it earns you nothing. Even if no one sees it.

Case in point: I had a friend who loved baking. She made these amazing, over-the-top cakes just for fun. Then people started telling her, “You should sell these!” So she did. And a year later, she quit. The joy was gone. It became about customer requests, deadlines, and Instagram aesthetics. She doesn’t bake for fun anymore, and honestly, it’s kind of sad.

Or look at people like Emma Chamberlain — she started making YouTube videos because she liked editing and being funny. Now she’s running a coffee company and doing high fashion, but in multiple interviews she’s talked about how burnt out she became from monetizing every aspect of her personality. The thing that once made her happy became a job, and that changes the dynamic completely.

I'm not saying it's *bad* to turn your hobby into a career — if you *want* to, and you enjoy the business side of it, go for it. But the pressure to do so, like it's the *default*, is unhealthy. Not everything needs to be productive or profitable to be worthwhile.

You can knit a scarf and not sell it. You can make digital art and not post it. You can play piano and never perform for anyone. That doesn’t make your time less valuable — in fact, it might make it *more*.

Let’s bring back hobbies that are just hobbies. No audience. No monetization. No pressure. Just joy.",3,1744793245.0,unpopularopinion,4,0.67,False

1. I joined a IT company after switching in 2021. I liked a colleague very much . She worked in my team only . She was Senior Software Engineer and i was a Software Engineer (1 year older than me ). Her smile was elegant and her voice was very soothing, one of the most beautiful girl, i ever saw in life. I saw her in office in march 20222 due to covid wfh . I instantly fell for her.
2. I wish i could ask her for date , i was very close to it . But suddenly some problems came in my life , i decided to resolve it and become a better version of myself and will ask for date in sep 2022 . That was my target . We used to go for lunch together in team and used to share food also .
3. Later 1 day I got to know from my manager that she got engaged (arranged by parents in the same caste  )on some 11 july 2022 . I didn't knew about it . I cried that night alone in my room .She didn't informed me as maybe i was not so close to her . I felt devastated and cried for whole day . I knew i had no option to move on . It was very difficult , i cried for so many days . She got married in November. She invited all office colleagues and so i also went , bought a nice gift and i wrote a message (May ur life is filled with love and happiness ). she wore a green saree in reception, My heart was burning, but i could not do anything . I wanted to switch the job , but couldn't. I had to see her office daily .. used to talk to her normally. We were three people in the team me, the girl and her best friend. Still many times i cooked dishes for them and took it to office. I knew she could never be mine but i wanted her to be happy. I remained a fun loving friend only .
4. I knew i had to move on so in 2023 i started searching girl for me in matrimony (as dating seemed to hard for me ). in 2024 june i got engaged and in dec 2024 i got married to a wonderful person . I told her about the colleague also . She understood me a lot .
5. Now it is 2025 april 15 , yesterday her best friend told me that the girl got divorced in 2023 only and now on 10 th april she got remarried. I was shocked to core, i just sat there.Her friend told that since u are a friend and u share ur things to us so we wanted to share it with u.
6. for the whole time I used to go lunch with them, walk with them, used to have coffee with them ,i never knew this issue. I knew that some problems were there but not till this extent. I overcame a lot of feelings and moved on life whole time i used to discuss with them that i am searching to marry someone(no caste barrier ). I used to tell them that i got rejected by many girls . That was the time she was in the divorce process. the timelines were matching.
7. Now it is 16 th april , i haven't slept yesterday night. so many thoughts has crossed  my minds. The problems she went through it , i never knew it . If i knew she got divorced i would have asked her for date . I would have  moved mountains to be with her . Fate is so cruel .

I still regret that i should have asked for date in 2022 only  ( i waited to become perfect person , solve my    problems .) . Life would have been diferent . Even if she said no , i would have been happy  . We cannot force someone to love us . I wish i had switched job after her marriage i could have forgotten her . Instead  i let myself burn for these years and when i moved on i am burning now again .

I discussed this with my wife yesterday , she hugged me and said things will be okay . She is the best person for me , but this stupid mind is racing and heart is sad !! i cried today on my fate .

SO i wish i had asked her on date in 2022 , i would have got my answer !! this much only i wanted to say .",13,1744792470.0,InsideIndianMarriage,29,0.76,False

Bat - 5/10, off the get go its very fruity and fresh I can really smell the guava in it but as it dries down it sort of gets almost fecal

Beaver (Maple) - 8/10, very heavy on the maple syrup, its a neat gourmand scent that I wouldnt mind wearing tbh

Bee - 5/10, this is just the same as drenching yourself in raw honey. The opening for me is really bad on me very medicinal alcoholic hangover scent. Dry down is sweet and decent

Camel - 4/10, horse. This is just horse stable. 

Chameleon - 6/10, very colorful if that makes sense. I get the fruits but theres also a synthetic kind of nail polish smell to this.

Chipmunk - 5/10, oddly enough I kinda dont smell it, like the opening but it dries down to a sort of unboiled peanuts

Civet - 7/10, opens as very aromatic very spice laden then dries down to coffee which is a nice touch since civets are known for eating coffee berries.

Cockatiel - 3/10, i do not like this. It smells like burning plastic and not in a good way 

Cow - 9/10, you can really smell the apple in this. I was expecting like a gourmand kind of milk scent but what i got was a very green, fresh milk scent if that makes scents. 

Dodo - 0/10, rancid, awful honestly smells like durian, onion and basil. This is just bad. I’ve seen videos on how they rate Dodo as one of their top scents and I think my nose might be broken

People were right to say that Zoologist is not blind buy friendly. I mostly disliked the majority of these scents. But two gems were in here for me which were the Cow and Beaver Maple. Excited to review the next set of samples!",4,1744791870.0,fragrance,2,1.0,False

It sucks. I'm laying on the couch and wrapped up like a burrito as I watch dinosaurs eat people. So I'd be up to do the generic thing of swapping pet pics, talking about games or music, supervillain plans and all that jazz. My sleep is messed up so if you're wanting soneone to chat all night and day with that's me.

I like games and play on Xbox and PlayStation. Space Marine 2 and Destiny and helldivers 2 are my go-to games. I enjoy shooters and action games and the occasional city builder or rts on pc. Any recommendations are welcome.

I like cooking and so far I haven't gotten sick or made someone else sick so you can say I'm like the Gordon Ramsay of cooking something edible. I do look at recipes in terror and sometimes actually cook them. Looking for cool chatters and maybe we can play games. Or not. Who knows.

Was a huge reader until the fire nation blessed me with sudden ADD or HD or 8k or whatever. Still have the Dune sequels to read. Big warhammer 40k novel enjoyer too.

Pink Floyd is my favorite band. I mainly listen to rock and metal. But I do on occasion listen to the Macarena and Barbie girl as I shower or cook.

1k0fa3j,https://i.redd.it/wbkkl88qo5ve1.jpeg,Small Wins & Gratitude,"Took my pre-diabetes (self-diagnosed) seriously and saw it drop from 6.3 to 6. 

Made improvements to my diet. Cut down carbs and increased protein. Cut out as much sugar as i could from my daily coffees and teas and wanton dessert consumption. Switched to sugar-free alternatives (coke zero, sugar free ice creams for the occasional cheat day) and survived three family birthdays without pigging out and losing progress. 

Hit the gym with cardio and weight training. Brought my weight down from 133.3 to 115kgs over 3 months. Still a long way to go to bring it below 5.7, but i’m just so happy to see this seemingly drastic shift in my A1c. 

From being paranoid about losing this battle to now having the confidence to make the next leg of this journey. Thank you for all the support on this group. 🙏

I see people building each other up constantly and it makes all the difference. ❤️

PS: sorry if this seems like a gloat post, just couldn’t help but share positive progress with y’all.

But it was a part of a dream I had randomly. I was writing a creative writing story for english and I just decided to plaguerize and episode of Goseiger despite never having watched a single episode of Goseiger.

So the story went with the a coffee themed Kaijin that some how really defeating the Sentai team, with them begging for it to stop. The Kaijin then rips off their suit or make them detransform before breaking their weapon and pouring coffee over it.

That part because for second I thought it was piss and that confused me enough to where I just woke up.

Once more I have never watched an episode of Goseiger ever [hell even PR MF]. So that makes it even weirder ",1,1744791324.0,supersentai,0,1.0,False

1k0f7y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k0f7y8/aitah_for_choosing_to_hang_out_with_my_boyfriend/,AITAH for choosing to hang out with my boyfriend instead of my friends?,"My post got deleted from AITA, so I'm reposting here.

Using a throwaway because some of my friends have Reddit.

For context: I (21F) go to university about 20 hours from my hometown. My boyfriend (21M) lives 5 hours away from my hometown, so we are long-distance no matter where we are.

Basically, this past holiday season, I went home for a month for winter break. My boyfriend and I had made plans for him to come visit me the week before Christmas since we hadn't seen each other in 2 months. My friend, ""Stacy"" (22F), and I hung out a lot while I was home, and I had told her how excited I was to see my boyfriend on multiple occasions.

The day that my boyfriend came to my city, Stacy texted me asking to hang out. I told her I couldn't, because my boyfriend was there. She said okay, and we moved on. A few hours later, a mutual friend, ""Alice"" (21F), texted a groupchat with Stacy and me, asking if we wanted to go out for dinner. I replied to the text and declined, explaining that my boyfriend was with me. Alice said he was free to join us if he wanted to, but I said no because I didn't want to impose, plus I just wanted some 1-on-1 time with him.

Stacy called me immediately after I sent that text and asked me why I wasn't going to dinner with them. I restated all my reasons, and I told her that I would love to go the next weekend if they wanted to. She got upset with me, saying that I was choosing my boyfriend over my friends.

Now, this is the part where I may be the AH: I told her that it wasn't fair of her to say that when she consistently bails on all of us at the last minute to go on various dates. I also said that I would rather spend time with my boyfriend, who I haven't seen in 2 months, than go out with them and get drunk for the 4th night in a row.

She hung up on me after I said that, and that was that. After my boyfriend left a few days later, I texted our groupchat and asked them if they wanted to get dinner that weekend since I was free. Nobody responded to me. I sent another (unrelated) text a few hours later, and they responded to that one. Then, I resent my question about the dinner plans because I figured they had just been busy earlier and hadn't seen it. Again, nobody responded. I realized that they may have been upset with me, so I texted Alice privately asking if everything was okay. She said that she was fine, but Stacy had been complaining in a separate groupchat, calling me an AH and saying that I didn't care about my friends.

I hadn't spoken to Stacy since then, but this past weekend, I went home to visit my family, and I figured I would reach out. I invited her out to grab coffee and talk, but she didn't respond.

So, was I the AH?
