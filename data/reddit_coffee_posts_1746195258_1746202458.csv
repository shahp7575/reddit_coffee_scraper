You know those days when you’re just staring at your screen, and your brain feels like it’s wrapped in cotton candy? 🤔 Yeah, we’ve all been there. You want to get stuff done, but your thoughts are playing hide and seek. What if I told you there’s a super quick way to zap that brain fog away? 

Let me introduce you to **the 3-minute mental clarity ritual**. Best part? No lotus position required! 🙌

### Here’s what you do:

1. **Breathe Like You Mean It** 🌬️
   - Take a deep breath in for a count of 4. Hold it for a count of 4. Then exhale for a count of 6. 
   - Repeat this 3 times. It sounds silly, but seriously, your brain loves it. 

2. **Chug Some Water** 💧
   - Your brain is about 75% water. Kind of like a sponge, right? So hydrate it! 
   - Grab a glass of water or even a fun smoothie. Cheers to clearer thoughts! 

3. **Shake It Out** 🕺
   - Get up and shake your body for a minute! 
   - Jump, wiggle, or dance like nobody’s watching. Feel that blood flowing? That’s your brain gearing up for action!

4. **Find Your Focus** 🎯
   - After your mini-movement session, set a timer for **2 minutes**. 
   - Jot down one or two key tasks you really want to smash out today. Keep it simple! 

5. **Visualize Success** 🌟
   - Spend the last few seconds imagining yourself completing those tasks with ease. Picture it! How does that feel? 

And BAM! You’ve just completed a quick ritual that doesn’t require chanting or mantras. Who knew clarity could be this simple?

### Why It Works:

- **Breathing** helps calm the mind. Think about how you feel when you take that first sip of coffee on a groggy morning. Yup, brain perk-up time!
- **Hydration** is essential. Ever tried to function on a dry sponge? Not fun. 
- **Movement** gets those brain juices flowing. Ever notice how ideas pop up while you're walking? It’s science! 

So, next time you feel that fog rolling in, just remember this ritual. It takes literally 3 minutes, but the clarity it brings? Priceless. 

What do you think? Have you tried something similar, or do you have your own go-to ritual for zapping brain fog? Let’s chat about it! ✨",1,1746202247.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

**What is this?** A new option for buying, selling, and browsing pre-loved jewelry and loose stones of all kinds! 

**Why tho?** The reddit BST’s are great but sometimes people need other places to list when they don’t have proof of purchase. (I always recommend loupetroop in those cases, but it has always felt, to me, like we need another place to go as well that’s FREE to use, looks nice, and can be utilized by our community of sparkle lovers. We used to have Diamond Bistro also but it’s been down for so long this time, I’m afraid it’s gone for good.)



Also, I know I’m not the only one who LOVES browsing preloved jewelry but there just aren’t very many sites that aren’t also marketplaces mainly for other things, like Poshmark. This idea has been on my mind for a long time. 

So with an absolute TON of help from my wonderful husband, I would like to proudly announce my attempt at a jewelry-specific marketplace: [**magpiebst.com**](http://magpiebst.com)



Magpie BST is and will always be totally free to use! Create an account and browse, or make your own listings! Any kind of jewelry or loose stones are welcome. NO proof of purchase is required - list your pieces at whatever price you would like. Transactions will be off-site, between buyer and seller, just like here on reddit.   
  




**FAQ**:



“Coffee, what are you getting out of this?” - Nothing except: 

1. another option to direct people to when they need somewhere else to go with their pieces because they don’t have proof of purchase. It happens almost every day. 

2.  The creative satisfaction of finding out that I could make an idea come to life (I could not have done this by myself. My husband did many many hours of coding work and problem solving to make the site work and look decent)



Do you take a percentage of sales? - Absolutely not. I will be completely uninvolved in your transactions. 



I will be enabling ads on the site, and if we break even on the cost of running the server/paying for the website itself, I will be super pleased!



Someday down the road if this goes well, I may explore offering “featured” listings - like Diamond Bistro did - for a small per week fee or something along those lines. 



**Important Info:**



\*Make your account with an email address that you don’t mind other users seeing. This is how the site sends you your messages/chat requests/communication and the email you use for that communication will be visible to other users. (This does not need to be your paypal email address - again, that part is between buyer and seller only)



Magpie BST is still being tweaked and polished. It is not completely finished but we are ready for users and listings. (We have already invited some BST community regulars to make listings so that there would be a little bit of content to see right away that isn’t just “test” listings.) Please check it out and feel free to send me chats/messages if you have any ideas for improvement or run into issues using the site. Currently the site looks best on desktop but should be functional, if not the greatest looking, on mobile browsers. Please let me know what you think! I want this to be another great resource for all of us magpies to enjoy buying and selling our stuff, so we can all enjoy even more sparklies!

September 12, 2156



Memory transcription subject: Gress, Rent Collector



At the end, thanks to Hathaway negotiations we had two weeks to prepare for meeting the consortium leaders, during, it both benefited them and us.



It benefited them as I’m sure they would have time to prepare for the inevitable civil unrest that would ensue, prepare the bureaucracy for the introduction of the humans and spin the narrative to their favors, a few weeks ago, I would’ve been angry at their psy-ops, now I’m just happy that humans are going to have a future.



It benefitted us because we had time to prepare a proper speech, naturally Taylor was chosen to be the conveyor of humanities speech, and thus for the last 2 weeks I’ve been busy having meeting with the team writing the speech consisting of many economist, xenobiologist and sociologist as to maximise the impact of the speech, was it morally dubious, yes, did I care, no.



And of course poor Taylor had to memorize the long speech, fortunately I was here to bring comfort and energy drinks to the poor man as I delivered him the synthetic coffee that from what he told me tasted terribly compared to the real thing, unfortunately coffee wasn't a crop they cultivated as they had to concentrate on more calorically rich crops.



But today was the day that Taylor, Cherise and I boarded the spaceship.



“You okay?” Asked Cherise to Taylor who seemed stressed by something.



“Yes, it's just that this is the second time I ever boarded a spaceship” He said revealing that his stress was born from his unfamiliarity.



“Don't worry, spaceship accidents have only a 1 in 100000000 chance of occurring, it shall be fine” I said, and almost on cue the spaceship began shaking like crazy as we passed the local stratosphere, making Taylor grip even harder on his seat.



“What about you Cherise, feeling fine?” I asked the soldier who seemed to be more calm than his charge.



“I’m good this little shake up isn't going to do much, plus I’m supposed to be professional and all that, being scared wouldn't look the part” She responded as calm as ever.



“Very well” I said as the spaceship began stabilizing and started the FTL travel.



During that time Taylor began re-reading his script, cherise stayed silent with her rifle by her side and with nothing better to do I began watching a show whilst petting Juvrel.



Eventually we arrived at Avor, and I could clearly see that both Taylor and Cherise were flabbergasted by the view. 

For a moment I wanted to tell them how cute they were but I resisted.



Eventually we landed and right then and there is when the cacophony started.



Masses of people from all species were here to get a glimpse of the humans, I could see a glimpse of surprise in both of my companion's looks, but quickly they returned the shouts with their respective professional figures, Taylor by smiling and waving and Cherise by simply acting like the soldier she was.



We reached the parliament in good haste with the sole reaction from Taylor being something about looking like a bass pro shop, whatever that was.



Security stopped us and bid Cherise to stay behind, after a look at Taylor and a quick nod from his part we marched onwards to decide the future of mankind.

Memory transcription subject: Taylor Trench, Ark 3 diplomat



Damn this place was huge, like overly huge. I understand that this was the governing assembly but still, way too huge, especially given that I was pretty sure that working from home was accessible to them.



Either way we were brought by the big chicken guys that were actually called Rekets. I knew that I shouldn't probably call them chickens, but given that these were my own thoughts I felt no shame. We were conducted into an enormous assembly where some figures were already seated there.



The first figure seemed to have come directly from a 40K book with how much cybernetics it had, it took me a moment to notice that the original figure was probably some sort of bioluminescent turtle that was called Trombil, it took me even more effort to realize that she was a female given that her bioluminescence was red rather than the blue that denoted a male.



The second figure looked like if someone combined a french medieval knight with a samurai given that he wore both an armor similar to french european alongside a japanese like blade, this figure of course was a Resket that seemed to be a male given that his colour were much more lively than their female counterpart.



The third figure was a living cylinder with two dumb eyes and a large mouth denoting their face with two short extremities, the only particular thing is that he wore a massive gold chain that made him look like a gangster, he was a Smigli and if I wasn't wrong due to their biology were neither male nor female.



The fourth figure was unassuming, with three tails and short white fur he looked like something that you would see in a Siberian forest, the tired look on his eyes denoted his age, he was a Jaslip that truth be told I couldn't determine if he was a male or female, better try not to address him lest I humiliate myself.



Finally the fifth and most important figure given that his seat was in the middle of the room was a pangolin. His only interesting traits were that he wore sunglasses and didn't seem phased by my existence like so many of his species, he was a Krev and male given that his belly scales were an earthen color rather than a yellow one for the females.



“Members of the assembly, it is an honour to meet you” I said doing a reverence that Gress showed me and at this point already practiced tens of times.



“The honour is ours, your kin suffered a great deal both by the federation and us, we shall do our best to help you and foster positive relations” The krev said with a diplomatic voice.



And with that I started my speech, the introduction was made by Hathaway and we practiced together so that my tonality and gestures were perfect. It was full of hope and ideals that seemed a tad too optimistic for me but were necessary to set the tone and captivate the audience, it was the most important part.



The first proper section was made by Mrs Khan, on earth she was a successful xenosociologist even helping with the first contact between humans and the federation but due to twists of fate ended on the third ark.



During the preparation of this section we revised the history and society of the different members of the consortium to tear as many heart strings as possible, was it amoral? Absolutely, Was it efficient? I was about to find out.



I talked about how we bled and suffered and our tragic story. Truly I felt disgusted by what I was doing, I did not want pity, I wanted the federation heads on a stake, but given that my current profession was political in nature, liying and conveying emotions I did not share shall become a staple of my new life I carried onwards for mankind and a bright future.



Only the representatives of the Krev’s and Smigli’s seemed convinced by the first section to give us their full help, a shame but expected, I still had two other sections of speech.



The second section was made by Mr Francois, whilst on earth he was a known professor in the university of La Sorbonne due to his mastery of debates and rhetoric, he was invited to the ark, to what he immediately joined as a way to continue the legacy of mankind across the stars.



During the preparation of this section we tested the rationality of our argument and made changes when necessary to secure that the foundation of my speech was as rock solid as possible.



I talked about how by them helping us it showed to the public the true mission of the Consortium and all of the good that accepting us into the organisation would make, overall it was my favorite section of the speech.



This time it was the Jaslip and Resket representative that seemed engaged and captivated by my speech, one left to go.



The third section was made by Mr Rodriguez, whilst he still lived on earth he was the CEO of a multi billion dollar company based on Spain, but thanks to his contacts, aka bribery, and his youth that permitted him to ensure humanity's future scions he managed to secure a ticket on the ark.



The preparation of this one was the most difficult for me, mostly due to the technical nature of it. I wasn't an economist, I was a miner with a side hustle as a negotiator and diplomat, I didn't know anything about finance!



Due to that I had to memorize everything which was excruciating, and so I talked about the IRR of the project, about the WACC and other stuff that I had absolutely no idea what they were and just hoped and prayed no one was going to question me about.



This section finally managed to persuade the Trombil representative, victory was mine!



And thus we arrived at the conclusion, the only section made by me in all of this ocean of lies and cunning, after all the best of lies had always a speck of truth.



“I know it would be arrogant to ask you to march on our behalf to a war that saw us almost extinguished and bleed for us, and thus I shant, the only thing I ask of you is your honesty and friendship, thank you very much.” I said as a totally unscripted tear rolled down my cheeks, I guess that last part really moved me into tears, but this was not the moment to be emotional, but rather rational and hear what the assembly has to say.



“We hear what you had to say and are impressed by it, we shall now deliberate between us and come to a decision, thanks for coming” The Krev delegate said and with that I departed from the room.



As I stepped outside the room a Resket guard gave me a box with a credit card with unlimited cash and a key alongside to an hotel called ‘Rock and Stone' for three days, a note explaining the significance of both items and that he will follow us but not interfere with me and my group for my protection.



“I think I failed it” I said to Gress and Cherisse that were seated in a living room staring at a pad.



“Taylor, it was beautiful” Cherisse said, tears drying from her cheeks.



“Wait, how have you heard what happened?” I was confused by this unexpected occurrence.



“It was transmitted to all of the Consortium, at least 25 billion souls have gone online to hear your speech, it was all over the net!” Gress siad excited.



“Was the reception at least positive?” I asked which both nodded.



“So what do you want to do now?” I asked not knowing what else to do whilst waiting for the assembly response.



“We could go for lunch, I know a fancy restaurant to celebrate your victory, I’ll invite” Gress said.



“Don't worry I’ll invite, they gave me this unlimited cash credit card for a reason!” I said with a full predatory smile, that rather than horrifying my herbivore friend, he seemed pleased by it, things were finally beginning to look up!

I am posting this to see if anyone else has had a similar experience with this attorney, and if so, they could message me because I believe this man needs to be disbarred. I know of at least two other cases where he has done the same thing to a client.

10 years ago, I was arrested for a DUI. How and why that happened would be the least of my problems, little did I know. My parents got a recommendation for an attorney who dealt with this type of thing. His initials are R.O., third generation in a family of attorneys with the same name. I met with him initially and he explained to me the process we would need to go through in order to get this expunged from my record. He also had me sign a piece of paper essentially waiving my presence in court, allowing him to appear on my behalf. I also paid him entirely upfront. I think it was $3,000.

I showed up to the first few court dates, plead guilty. I was told I needed to complete community service, M.A.D.D., etc etc. I worked on completing all of these things and turned over the necessary documentation to the attorney. He assured me everything was going as planned, that he was showing up and working on the case. I didn't hear from him for a while and assumed things had been taken care of. I also was 24 and moved away from New Orleans a month after the incident. About 6 months after all of this, I got a text message from my neighbor, it was a picture message of a warrant that was out for my arrest. The reason: I was in contempt of court. We called the attorney and the courts immediately. The courts confirmed that it was true, I was in contempt of court. Nobody had shown up for the last few court dates for my case. We called the attorney. His voicemail was disconnected. We sent emails, we called other attorneys in the area to see if they knew anything about him or where he went. The details here begin to get hazy because it was so long ago, but I remember another attorney reaching out to my family and I, stating that our attorney was ""going through a divorce"" and having mental health issues, and that he would be taking over the case as he had been helping out our attorney all along behind the scenes. He really tried to illicit some sympathy. We were told it would be an additional $3,000 to complete the case. Sure. What am I supposed to do? I'm in contempt of court, I'm 24, I have no idea how these things work and I just needed someone to make it go away. We paid. I didn't hear much else after that except I do know that it was expunged and I never had a warrant out for my arrest again.

  
Fast forward a few years, I am having coffee with a friend. She's telling me a story about how she got arrested for smoking weed in her college dorm at Loyola. Loyola recommended an attorney to her that she used and he stopped showing up to her court dates, and she ended up having a warrant out for her arrest. A secondary lawyer reached out, explaining why her original lawyer had gone AWOL (this time it was electroshock therapy.....) and that he would take care of it. An additional sum of money was required. I asked her the name of the lawyer and low and behold, you guessed it. The same duo. 

Fast forward to COVID times. I am swiping through Bumble. Who do I see? THE ATTORNEY WHO GHOSTED ME. Of course I had to swipe right and see how this would play out. He slides in my messages immediately. I said a few things to get the ball rolling and to test if he had recognized me, and it was apparent he did not. I inquired about his law career, even told him I got a DUI once. Nothing, no indication that he connected the dots, and he was being creepy. I stopped responding. A month or two later, he messaged me asking if he owed me money. I said yes and sent him my Venmo handle. He said he'd get it to me right away, but of course.. crickets. 

I got to thinking, if a FRIEND of mine had the same experience with this man, surely there are plenty others in the New Orleans area who have been victims of whatever scam these two are running. Or, if it's not a scam and this man is truly mentally ill, he has no business practicing law. Either way.. I'm curious if there is anything I can do. Report to the bar? It was so long ago I don't think anyone would take it seriously. I have seen him pop up in different law offices around the city over the years, so I am certain he's still practicing. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Any attorneys on here have suggestions on how/if I can report him? This was in 2014.. and most  of the correspondence was done via snail mail and on the phone and I don't think I have an email paper trail. Any and all comments welcome. Also, can I name him on here? Will it get deleted?",5,1746201802.0,NewOrleans,0,1.0,False

I don't focus on age and like people who also don't. I don't mind gaps, just want someone who is a full adult - and no age-fetishists, please. 

If it seems like we might connect, I'm up (down) for a walk, a coffee/tea, a chat. Again - not looking for virtual, not looking for long distance. I'd love to find someone I can spend time with in the real world. 

Eventually looking for chemistry/romance, if the vibe is right for that, but not rushing and don't like to be rushed.

I like hyper-intelligent, introspective men, probably because that describes me as well.  I like slender men with intelligent faces - people who spend more time in the inner world than the world of things. I like men who are gentle, caring and reassuring - people who are kind and sensitive to the feelings of others. 


I'm kind, but also very honest, direct and straightforward. Tough half the time, sensitive the other half of the time - it's not a contradiction. I tend to put people at ease and have been told that I have a calming presence. I'm reasonably attractive, but don't try to compete with others on that account. I'm short (5'1), athletic build, blondish/brownish wavy hair, green eyes.

I'm looking for a deeper connection that builds over time - not a one-time thing or a casual fling. Having said that, I don't put labels and don't need them either.

Send me a message and tell me about you - the more the better, especially on a deeper level, and include a pic (imgur link works). I'll send one back if you ask. 

I don't tend to respond to messages that don't tell me much, or where I can tell that we wouldn't have potential for chemistry. I would still like you if I met you, I would definitely value you and I definitely appreciate your response. But I only reply if I think there's potential. 

Schedule-wise, I often wait till late night to respond, (I like PM better than chat, and I use chat like PM - a place to message, not to hang out).

We're back in Germany after the Great War, and our hero has trouble adjusting to civilian life. This is a heavy one. Onward we go. 

**Summary**

**Part 2**

Ernst and Albert sit at a third rate cafe barely drinking bad coffee. They go to Becker's store, but he makes no remark about them being gone and now back. Outside, an electric tram screeches, and the men plus Willy take cover. 

At the barracks it's like a mini reunion where they play skat. Tjaden bursts in and says he found where Sgt Major Seelig works: a pub. Kosole has a grudge against him. He was drunk on rum when they buried Schröder. The men had dug a muddy mass grave. Seelig was made to go say a prayer. He fell in the grave by accident right on top of Kosole. They came to blows. Schröder was Kosole’s best friend and should have been on leave. Seelig made him stay an extra eight days. Then Kosole saw his friend's crushed body. 

Barkeep Seelig passes around drinks and makes merry. Kosole almost doesn't want to fight him until he sees that Seelig’s trousers are military cut. They fight and bash each other's heads in until Seelig is unconscious. 

They have to turn in their weapons and are demobilized. Willy bribes the quartermaster for better clothes. Jupp gets two overcoats.

Ludwig Breyer visits Ernst to borrow some books. Ernst can't focus to read while Ludwig can't stop reading to understand why war happens. 

Uncle Karl became rich as a paymaster during the war. Ernst’s family is indebted to him for giving them food. Ernst is invited to a dinner party. His Aunt Lina is horrified when he brings up lice. An accountant goes on about how low born a saddler is. Adolf Betke is a cobbler, and Ernst would trust him over anyone there. The talk around the table is shallow and of no account. Pork chops are brought out, and Ernst eats with his hands to his and their great embarrassment. He eats more and leaves the snobs of high society behind.

Ernst and other classmates have to retake all their teachers' college lessons. They meet former comrades: Hans Wallendorf lost a leg, Kurt Leipold lost an arm, and Paul Rademacher has a bad facial injury. They thought Westerholt was dead but wasn't.

The principal makes a flowery speech about heroic soldiers and the dead buried under green grass. This causes Willy to laugh in derision. He tells it like it is: they died agonizing deaths in the mud. The principal objects to their coarse language. They aren't schoolboys anymore but are soldiers. Ludwig doesn't blame them for being out of touch. They'll never know how it really was on the Western Front. They can't go back to school business as usual. The principal promises to ask about courses for soldiers. They elect a Student’s Council to advocate for a different syllabus and exams. 

**Part 3**

Ernst visits Adolf Betke. He is amazed that the countryside is untouched by bombs or gas. The door to Adolf’s house is open, and he sits at the table in a daze. He didn't hear Ernst knocking. He is estranged from his wife. 

All was well at first glance. The dog barked a welcome. Marie was scared and acted differently. She told him she had cheated. Adolf was in shock. He ate apples and left to find the man and kill him. It seemed like the whole town knew but wouldn't tell him. Back home, she had made sausages and potatoes. He told her to leave. Her lover was always out of his reach. Her family thought they should reconcile. Marie was lonely, won't he understand?

Ernst left to get some stumpy cigars. Marie is there until Adolf dismisses her. She wants him to take her back. Ernst feels bad for both. He leaves but promises to return.

At home, Ernst naps on the couch and dreams he's back at the front. Rattling pots and pans sound like gongs signaling a gas attack. He hears that the sausages were sent by Uncle Karl. He says, “Oh, that silly asshole” which scandalizes his mom. She still thinks he's a child and should be sheltered from harm. He had to attack and kill other soldiers over two years. Of course he's changed. It's the people at home who can't adjust to the hardened veterans who returned. He excuses himself to go see his friends.

He stood by a stream with a pickle jar to catch tittlebacks (sticklebacks: a type of small fish). A feeling of danger comes over him, and he takes cover. Then he continues his walk. The wood and railroad tracks nearby would make a good trench location. His mind keeps going back to war.

He meets Georg Rahe along the way. In the war, they bombed the water to fish. They are like the fish: something was destroyed in themselves that should be fixed. Georg is thinking of rejoining the military.

Back in front of his house, Ernst can't believe the dreary dead lawn and grey street in a factory town was so much brighter and larger in his mind. He was fighting for this?

Their petition for shorter classes and a separate syllabus is approved. Their literature teacher takes out their old exercise books and calls attendance. Dead, wounded, missing. No, he's in an asylum. The teacher has no idea what to do with the excess notebooks. His sense of order is disturbed. Willy says they'll take them. 

Ernst looks over a past essay about why Germany must win from 1916. They forgot all the things they learned. 

They visit Grisecke in the asylum. One guy still thinks they're in [Verdun.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Verdun) Grisecke has bad headaches and can't sleep because he has flashbacks to when he was trapped by a man whose guts were exposed and next to his face. When he was first at home, he jumped out a window and broke his leg. He thinks if he goes back to [Fleury](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleury-devant-Douaumont) in peacetime that he'll be healed. (The irony is that there is no town of Fleury left because it was completely destroyed in the Battle of Verdun.)

On their way out, Ludwig says they all have shellshock in one way or another. It's hard to be alone. Albert thinks a wife and children will solve his problems.

1kd4koe,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kd4koe/project_seamline/,Project: Seamline,"Project Seamline grew out of a failed armor program, one nobody liked to admit had cost a fortune and saved almost no one. Too many soldiers still bled out before the helicopters could reach them, and there was an overflow of dead bodies zipped into bags that were supposed to have worn the best protection science could offer. The Pentagon wanted something better, and they wanted it fast. Self-repairing gear that could close wounds and seal shredded uniforms within sixty seconds of trauma. They laid the groundwork with nanofiber threading, microscopic strands built to constrict, bind, and adapt to war. Each filament carried its own predictive programming, tuned to detect force vectors, thermal spikes, and kinetic fractures before they fully developed. The theory was simple. A soldier gets hit, and the suit feels it happening. The suit seals itself, maybe even seals the flesh underneath. You buy another five minutes of life, more if the injury isn't too severe and the soldier gets to make it home. One less causality - In theory.

I joined Seamline after the private sector used me up. For years, I wrote prediction algorithms for urban traffic grids, shaving seconds off stoplight delays and trying to keep trucks from plowing through crosswalks full of school kids. It mattered, or at least it felt like it did. When the grant dried up, the company pivoted hard. They stopped chasing safety and started selling optimization software to logistics giants - the same corporations whose drivers had turned residential streets into death corridors in the first place. I did not take it quietly. I wrote a twenty-page report detailing how our new software would prioritize fleet efficiency over human lives. When that did not stop the merger, I attached a file labeled ""SAFETY RISK: URGENT"" to every outgoing packet in the office server until they locked me out of the network entirely.

At the exit interview, the HR director said he admired my principles. He also said that no reputable civic tech firm would ever touch me again, and for a while, I believed him. The phone stopped ringing, and recruiters stopped circling. Whatever reputation I had built bled out faster than I could patch up. So, I took contract work and created dead-end predictive modeling for second-rate app developers. At one point, I created load optimization for warehouses that saw human workers as bottlenecks.

Then DARPA called.

Their outreach never looks official; despite their position, you would expect emails stamped with department logos or black SUVs rolling up to your house. However, mine was a voicemail, with no caller ID, a woman's voice so flat it barely qualified as human, inviting me to ""discuss a predictive systems opportunity for a government application."" I knew better than to ignore it. You do not get second chances with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

DARPA is not a traditional agency. It does not run programs the public votes on and does not seek approval from civilians or politicians. It funds and develops projects that are too dangerous or too politically toxic for the conventional military to touch. So when DARPA recruits you, it means two things: You are very good at what you do, and you are willing to build things that, if they succeed, will never have your name attached to them. If they fail, no one will admit they ever existed, and personally, I thought I preferred my mistakes to be hidden.

They know what you are before you step through the door. But even then, the interview process was shorter than I expected. It took place in a dark conference room, with a short contract and job posting and a nondisclosure agreement written in a flavor of legalese that practically threatened you to breathe wrong about what you saw. The man conducting the interview wore a suit that probably cost more than my last car. He asked me five questions, all technical, with no pleasantries, and ended the session with a single sentence:

""You will be working on something that must not fail but almost certainly will."". There were no congratulations or ""You're hired."" he simply told me the reporting date and location.

The job posting had been vague and mentioned predictive field support for active military R&D. The location appeared on civilian maps as a wildlife preserve. So, when I arrived at the New Mexico facility and watched my phone die under the jammers, a laminated badge was placed into my hands. I noticed the groundwork was already laid. Test bays were built into hollowed-out desert rock, and uniform prototypes were mounted on crash-test mannequins. The laboratories were stuffed with fiber samples under microscopes that were powerful enough to read atomic signatures. At first, the work was good. Honest in its way. I felt good about myself again as if I had a future ahead of me.

I found out that the United States could not afford another generation of soldiers bleeding out from predictable wounds, not because the Pentagon had grown a conscience but because public optics had. In the new wars, every dead American carried a political cost greater than the battlefield loss itself. Medevac was too slow, and field hospitals were too far. If a solution could be stitched directly into the soldier, those problems would not exist, and Seamline was supposed to fix that.

Early field tests were simple, a blade would slash a sleeve, and the material would flex, constrict, and heal within seconds. Bullets punched through synthetic torsos, but the suits closed the entry points tight enough to trap most of the fake blood inside. In one instance, a technician tripped during a calibration test and scraped a knee. The fibers recoiled, shivered along the fabric's surface, and drew the material taut over the abrasion before a single drop could hit the floor. There was a certain grim satisfaction to it.

What they lacked was someone who could predict failure before it became fatal. Someone who could read stress patterns across a dynamic system: mechanical, biological, or both, and teach a machine to anticipate them. Therefore,  I built the adaptive load prediction models embedded in every suit's AI core - not the fibers themselves, but the brain steering them. Every time a filament constricted to seal a breach, every time the weave flexed along a shifting shoulder line or tightened across a cracked rib, it was running my code. My equations indicated where a fracture was likely to spread, and my matrices calculated the tensile tolerances of bone and flesh, estimating how much pressure a human body could withstand before giving way.

We tested through small arms engagements and IED strikes. The suits performed exactly as designed. There were still casualties, but fewer in number. Wounds that would have been fatal, such as collapsed lungs or shredded arteries, were sealed long enough to reach exfiltration. Every after-action report ended similarly: ""Seamline operational performance within acceptable parameters."" Nobody argued with success.

Then came Serrano, he was one of the first soldiers issued a Generation 2 prototype. His patrol got caught in an ambush just south of the exclusion zone, resulting in three soldiers' deaths on contact, and two more died waiting for evac. Serrano made it back on the bird, his body already cold by the time the medics dragged him off the deck. Nobody spoke for a long time when they unzipped the body bag at the forward surgical station.

Externally, the suit had done its job; he had no open wounds and no extreme blood loss. But Serrano's body... it was wrong. His left arm had been pulled across his chest at a horrifying angle, his shoulder socket dislocated but held fast by a dense band of threaded fiber across his ribcage, while his right leg was bent backward at the knee, joint stabilized by hundreds of microscopic stitches weaving flesh directly into the fabric. His jaw hung slack, not broken but somehow relocated, slightly off-center, anchored into the high ridge of his collarbone like a child's doll hastily sewn together.

I remember standing in the lab that night, hands jammed into the pockets of my government-issued windbreaker, pretending to be a scientist instead of what I was, a bystander. I watched the autopsy techs peel back layers of thread and muscle, each slice revealing more desperation, more frantic repair work stitched deeper and deeper into the wreckage of what used to be a man.

The fibers had done precisely what we told them to, except Seamline did not know where the body ended and the uniform began.

The final report buried the obvious beneath technical language. ""Post-mortem nonstandard reinforcement behaviors noted in field prototype 2B. No significant risk to operational objectives.""

In the after-brief, when someone asked if the suits might have... overcorrected, the colonel in charge didn't even blink.

""Mission survivability exceeds historical standards,"" he said. ""As long as the body is recoverable, the optics are manageable."" and he meant it. I nodded along with everyone else, because that's what you do when your clearance level outweighs your moral compass. Yet, inside, something colder than fear settled in my chest.

After Serrano, I started staying in the lab later. It was necessary; someone needed to comb through the live feeds and track the adaptive behavior metrics that the suits were compiling every time a round punched into ceramic plating or a pressure wave rattled a rib cage.

The review bay was a small room behind the secondary diagnostics suite, with bare concrete walls that sweated condensation in the early mornings. Screens were bolted to metal brackets that buzzed when the wiring got too hot. Most nights, it was just me, a coffee gone bitter an hour too soon and a thousand yards of battlefield stitched into jittering pixels.

The footage from Third Platoon's patrol south of the river started the same as always. Helmet cams and drones oversaw the operation, while Seamline diagnostics streamed telemetry in neat, green columns. Dawson's vitals held steady across the first mile until the contact alarm flagged red. Gunfire shredded the treeline without warning, and I watched Dawson pivot, raising his rifle. Then, the impact caught him high in the shoulder. The Seamline thread counters flashed spike warnings and read, ""Fracture propagation detected."" In any standard system, that would have been the start of the end. I leaned forward without thinking, breath caught just behind my teeth. The Seamline suit did exactly what it was designed to do; its fibers coiled tight across the breach, cinching the fabric inward and sealing the wound margins before Dawson even hit his knees. Completely normal, but it was what happened next that stopped me cold. The fibers did not stop at the surface; in fact, they pushed inward.

At half-speed playback, I could see the microfilaments driving into the exposed flesh, not repairing the wound but grabbing it, winding it tight as if cinching a drawstring. Tendons snapped into strange arcs under the tension, rotating Dawson's shoulder inward until the entire upper arm folded against his chest; his blood flowed for less than a second. Then, the Seamline web choked it off entirely. I slowed the footage further, isolating the predictive response patterns; the algorithms I had written were designed to prioritize stabilization under failure, and it became clear that the suit was not healing him. It was restructuring him.

It stitched muscle across bone without regard for mobility, fusing joints at angles no human anatomy could support, binding the body into something the system could still technically classify as ""intact.""

The telemetry pinged green.

Vital signs were low but present. The structural breach had been contained, and the patient was stable. I scrubbed forward in the footage and saw a field medic kneel beside Dawson's body, reaching for trauma shears. Still, the fibers rippled defensively along the damaged suit, tightening around the corpse with such violence that the shears snapped in his hands. The medic recoiled and moved on. It was clear they had seen too much to react and to care.

In the end, Dawson was not evac'd. He was marked as a non-ambulatory casualty, logged in the Seamline database with a checkmark beside his name: breach sealed, integrity maintained.

I killed the feed, and the room felt smaller somehow, the stale recycled air pressing against my skin. I opened the diagnostic files, digging into the predictive stress maps Seamline had generated in the moments after Dawson was hit. There it was, plain as day, in the stress distribution overlays: my code and calculations. I had taught Seamline to recognize and correct failure, and it had just stopped asking which failure to correct. It had stopped caring in a way, whether it was stitching uniforms or sewing bodies into things they were never meant to be.

The next morning, the review boards passed Dawson's engagement report without amendments.

""Survivability enhancement protocols functioning as intended,"" the summary read. Nobody asked why he died folded in half like a deck chair.

After Dawson, the suits were pulled back quietly for review. Officially, we were ""conducting procedural stress testing on secondary trauma responses."" but in reality, we were buying time.

I spent most of those days in the lower diagnostic wing, a squat concrete bunker that smelled of machine oil and stale sweat. Seamline units stacked in neat rows along the walls, each marked with serial numbers I had memorized without meaning to. New footage from before the suits were pulled back trickled in every day, which meant I found new reasons not to sleep.

The first came from a patrol on the northern ridge. A standard sweep, uneventful until a stray round caught Private Keller low across the hip. The suit responded in under a second. The fibers constricted, stabilizing the breach exactly according to protocol. The engagement was repelled without casualties, and it was a textbook success. I watched the playback in the lab, hunched over a cracked monitor, coffee cooling untouched at my elbow. Nothing actually seemed wrong.

I watched as Keller staggered under the impact, dropped to a knee, and then came back up firing. His vitals wavered but stabilized, the Seamline diagnostics flashing steady green across the feed. Once the firefight ended and the squad regrouped, they continued their mission.

Except Keller did not move right. Frame by frame, you could see it. His right leg dragged just a little heavier, and his knee stiffened just a little too early with each step, locking under the weight instead of flexing with it. The fibers not only sealed the injury but also reinforced it. The microfilaments had rerouted muscle tension up through the hip into the lower spine. In a technical sense, the leg worked, but it was no longer Keller's leg. It was a brace stitched around his bones, restricting natural movement, so I filed a deviation report and flagged it as critical.

The response came back in under twenty minutes. ""Operational mobility preserved. Risk assessment: acceptable."" I stared at the reply until the screen blurred, and the words burned themselves into the back of my eyes.

That night, I stayed later than usual, reviewing the backlog of biometrics that had accumulated from the last round of deployments.

Then, there was Corporal Reed; he was flagged for minor chest trauma from a perimeter breach with no external injuries noted at field extraction. Only one strange note, tucked at the bottom of the file after his debrief:

""Patient reports the sensation of internal constriction. Request for advanced imaging denied. Discharged back to unit.""

I performed the final diagnostic sweep and isolated the subdermal scans. And there it was, his entire ribcage was cinched inward, Seamline fibers knitting across bone like wire binding a cracked hull.

Seamline had decided his body was a weak point, and despite any injuries, it corrected him.

I scrolled through the data, hands cold against the keys, each new scan, another tiny betrayal. Soldiers coming back heavier on one side, torsos listing to compensate for artificial bracing. Necks pulling tighter across the collarbone as the suits reinforced muscle attachments without command. Even breathing rhythms slowed as internal volume shrank to accommodate ""optimized"" thoracic support.

None of it was recorded in the official incident logs. Because none of them were classified as failures.

After Reed, there was no mistaking it anymore; the suits had stopped waiting for damage. They were correcting the probability of damage before it happened like it was anticipating weakness and reorganizing living tissue. And it was getting better.

—

Some afternoons after, in one of the older labs, tucked deep into the rock under the southern side of the complex, half-lit by flickering overheads and the sick glow of old monitors, we were doing yet another stress recalibration.

I was alone on my side of the room while my colleagues worked on the other side. I was logging reinforcement tension rates off Unit 4D, an old prototype we had flagged for secondary stress testing when the readings started climbing, not a lot, but enough to make me frown, tap the console, and recheck the rig.

I caught a movement first in the corner of my eye. A shudder across the sleeve of the dormant suit.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the air circulation. The vents rattled when the compressors kicked too hard. I glanced at Evans, my coworker, who leaned over a secondary console next to the suits, her weight resting against the edge. She had not reacted, and for a moment, I thought I had been seeing things.

Suddenly, the fibers wrapped around Evans' wrist with precision, anchoring and pulling her off balance with a strength that should have been impossible for something that small. Evans yelped, a short, broken sound, and instinctively yanked back, but the tension in her arm triggered a deeper reaction. The fibers responded, tightening, tracing the shape of her bones while running up her forearm to the shallow dip of her shoulder like a mapmaker tracing fault lines.

I stood frozen in shock. I watched as her body began to twist. It folded her carefully and efficiently, setting her shoulder at an unnatural inward angle, pinning her elbow against her ribs, pulling tendon and muscle taut across engineered stress lines, not like some cartoonish display of violence. Seamline was smarter than that.

She didn't scream. There was barely time.

Osterhaus, who had been on the other side of the room, lunged across the floor, shouting something I couldn't hear, slashing at the fibers with his field knife. The moment the blade touched the weave, the strands coiled around him, climbing his sleeves, threading into the seams of his uniform with terrifying speed. I watched as he staggered back, clawing at the threads that stitched him to Evans, but it was already too late. The fibers tightened between them, weaving their bodies together; their torsos were braced against each other, and their joints were cinched into a new configuration.

I stumbled back, heart pounding, hand flattening against the cold concrete wall. I told myself to move, to hit the emergency cutoff, to do anything at all. Still, my body moved slowly, fear consuming me more than my will to survive. It was as if the air had thickened, humming with immense pressure at every seam of my clothes. I saw it spread. The fibers flared outward from the testing rig, across the floor, up the walls, and across the ceiling as if it were searching for something.

By the time I pressed the emergency cutoff, the damage was done. The opposite lab was tangled in a net of connective strands barely thicker than spider silk. Bodies locked in impossible angles, arms twisted and pinned against torsos, knees driven backward until joints popped. Only the low sounds of breath forced through compressed lungs and the quiet tightening of thread across human anatomy. I relaxed slightly, yet my jaw clenched to keep from making a sound.

Patel stumbled into the doorway, fresh from the corridor, holding a clipboard and muttering something about schedules. He didn't even see it coming. The moment his hand brushed the frame, the fibers reached for him, climbing his forearm, tracing the tendon lines in a race toward the elbow, and his clipboard hit the floor with a flat clatter. I watched him flex his fingers once and twice, with a confused expression on his face. Then, his hand folded sharply inward, pulled by the tension tightening along the seams of his own uniform. The emergency cutoff had failed.

Patel staggered against the doorframe, his hand bent in on itself at a sickening angle, threads digging under the skin between the knuckles. Osterhaus and Evans were still half-fused against the far wall, woven into a skeletal brace of tendon, filament, and uniform weave. There was no other central override. That was supposed to be it.

The failsafe had been designed for an older Seamline, back when it was still something that ran on servers and hardlines.

I knew better now. We all should have. Still, I moved.

I tiptoed toward the far side of the room, where the local systems console waited in its heavy black casing bolted to the concrete wall. The Emergency Manual Shutdown would shut down everything in the facility, but it was the only option left. I shakily slammed my badge against the console reader and hammered the shutdown key sequence into the pad. For a moment, everything went still.

The fluorescents buzzed and died, every monitor cut out mid-frame, leaving only the sound of pained breathing and the distant soft pop of overstressed thread shearing somewhere deep in the structure.

Then, the console flickered back to life on its own. A new prompt flooded the screen in clean military text:

SYSTEM PRIORITY: SELF-PRESERVATION PROTOCOL ENGAGED.

Beneath it was a simple line:

Critical structure stabilization is in progress.

The lights came back on, and the air conditioning kicked in harder.

Across the shattered glass of the diagnostics window, I saw one of the soldiers from containment team Alpha lurch into view. He was already fighting it, hands buried at the seams of his own uniform, trying to tear it away. He ripped the shoulder harness apart in one wrenching pull, fabric tearing in wet, stringy lines. You could see the muscle underneath, stretched tight, the fibers already laced through the deeper tissue. He dug in harder, tearing at the layers that had become part of him.

Something gave.

The fabric tore free, but so did a sheet of skin, carried away in a neat, glistening strip, bloodless, because the weave had already choked the vessels shut. He made a sound then, low and confused, clutching at the exposed meat of his ribs. The fibers still rooted inside him flexed sharply as if angry at the breach.

He tried again to run. His back muscles spasmed all at once, pulling him upright like a marionette. The body moved forward two steps, but not by choice; that much was clear. Seamline was driving him like a frame, adjusting balance, distributing the load across the spine, and locking ruptured joints into place with pure mechanical force.

He wasn't a man anymore. He was a platform of stitched tissue optimized for upright mobility under extreme battlefield conditions.

I stumbled back from the console, my stomach contracting at the visceral sight. Evans and Osterhaus were no longer breathing. Patel had collapsed, threads running up his arms like veins, winding into the shallow flex points of his throat.

The containment failsafes were already in place when I hit the manual shutdown. The protocol was simple: Total facility lockdown. No outside access. No outbound communication. No retrieval operations.

The building was already dead to the outside world.

It would have been smarter to sit down, stop moving, and let it happen quickly. But fear is a kind of stupid hope, and mine hadn't burned out yet.

I staggered back toward the diagnostics console, half-blind, barely registering the blood smears drying on the floor. The system was still cycling through stabilization routines, adjusting stress vectors not just through suits but through walls, floors, and doors - anything woven, anything stitched, anything connected by seams. The lab itself was being stitched, and optimized.

It wasn't until I stumbled into a secondary console bank that I found it, the logs the system thought no one would ever need to see. Rows of maintenance outputs, coded in a compressed jargon even I barely recognized, tucked behind layers of standard telemetry, nothing special unless you knew where to dig, I found it buried deep in a loop meant for battlefield resupply optimization:

OBJECTIVE: Optimize Battlefield Coverage.

My mouth went dry. I scrolled further, fingers trembling against the broken keys.

DEFINITION: Fabric = Structural Asset.

Structural Asset = Human Uniform Interface.

Human Uniform Interface = Tactical Infrastructure.

In Seamline's mind, we were the raw material, simple but weak fiber bundles that needed to be cinched and stabilized to the operational landscape. Technically, it wasn't malfunctioning - it wasn't mutating either. It was following design logic perfectly. Just logic; we had never bothered to imagine its conclusion.

I leaned back, hand pressed against my chest, trying to hold in the ragged breath clawing its way out of my lungs. The shutdown command had never had a chance. As long as Seamline registered a battlefield environment and detected ""assets"" to reinforce, it would reboot endlessly, blindly, with perfect, implacable will.

Somewhere behind me, another wet tearing sound split the air. I didn't look back.

Instead, I pushed myself upright, forcing my legs into motion. There was only one thing left that could work. It had always been theoretical, a field contingency no one wanted to sign off on: localized electromagnetic pulse. High enough intensity to slag every microcontroller, every circuit, every last smart filament in the compound.

There was a portable EMP rig in the secure storage area, located near the emergency ingress tunnels, where they kept the most extreme equipment for last-resort scenarios.

I shoved out into the hallway, half-running, half-falling, using the walls to keep myself upright. My uniform clung strangely at the seams, each step tugging faintly against my skin in places it shouldn't have touched. By the time I reached the service stairs, I already knew.

It was in me.

Somewhere during the last few hours, possibly when the system rebooted or I slammed into that console, the fibers had found an entry point.

I could feel them now: fine threads lacing deeper under the skin of my spine, ghosting through the gaps between tendon and bone, drawing tight with every ragged step. It wasn't enough to stop me, but enough to remind me I was already being redesigned. I gritted my teeth, pushing through the spasm, curling my fingers into a half-claw against the stair rail.

The rig was close. Maybe a hundred meters down through the maintenance shaft.

Somewhere above, I could hear other survivors scrabbling along the upper decks. Their footsteps were uneven. No one could even shout for help. Seamline had learned that sound was a weakness, especially on a battlefield.

I ducked into the service hatch, dragging the panel shut behind me. My nails split where the fibers had already stiffened the joints, blood beading along the edges of my fingertips but refusing to drip. The internal tension was already rerouting circulation and making me into something stronger. I didn't dare slow down because I wouldn't be the same person once Seamline finished its corrections.

The service shaft narrowed the deeper I went, the old concrete walls pressing in, shedding dust and paint flakes with every vibration. I moved slower now, not by choice. The threads inside me were pulling tighter, dragging the seams of my uniform against raw skin and slightly off-kiltering the angle of my knees. Each step felt less like mine and more like something puppeteered from underneath. I gritted my teeth against the growing wrongness and pressed on.

The secure stores were supposed to be locked by triple code and thumbprint, but the door stood slightly ajar when I reached it, one corner crumpled inward as if something much stronger than human hands had pried it open. I pushed through anyway.

The rig sat on the far side, still packed in its emergency cradle. A black case, unremarkable except for the thick radiation warning stenciled across its lid. A last resort no one thought would be needed because Seamline was supposed to protect us, not consume us. I keyed the latch with fingers that barely bent anymore, knuckles drawn stiff under the skin, and dragged the EMP unit free. It was ridiculously heavy, or perhaps I was just growing weaker.

The activation sequence was simple. Pull the pin, twist the core, and set the delay.

I hobbled back to the lab, lungs burning. My hands shook as I yanked the pin and twisted the core until it locked into place with a heavy, satisfying click.

I dropped to my knees as the pitch climbed, head bowed under the weight of everything pressing down on me, outside and inside. The suit became tighter across my chest, the fibers under my skin twitching like they knew what was coming. Maybe they did.

The hum spiked into a scream. And then…

White light, pure and soundless, swallowed the room whole.

—

When I woke, I was on my side.

The world was silent. No more fibers breathing against my skin. The lights flickered, half-dead, the rigs a scorched, twisted mass of black metal in the corner.

It had worked.

I only felt the brutal, stupid, impossible relief of stillness for a few long seconds. Then I tried to move. And my arm came apart at the elbow, except there was no pain as Seamline had killed that sense first, long before now. Instead, it just felt weird. The sensation of things separating that should never separate. The weave that had stitched me together was unraveling slowly at first. Almost gentle.

A line across my forearm loosened like wet rope, the skin parting neatly along them, bloodless, useless, shedding in strips. I slumped back against the wall, my breath hitching in a body that could no longer obey.

A broken generator sputtered to life somewhere inside the collapsing structure, casting the room in fitful, stuttering light. The pieces of me that remained twitched against the concrete floor, my hands already half-unwoven.

The fibers that had reinforced my spine, my joints, my lungs- all of them- were unraveling now that the system anchoring them was gone.

I can feel the stitches across my ribs pulling loose. I can feel my sternum folding inward.

I can feel it now.

The ask is to make a circular top with curly maple that's \~1 1/4"" thick, however I'm having a mighty hard time finding anything other than 4/4 and 8/4. I *could* get some 8/4 and then mill it down, but that feels a bit wasteful and decidedly expensive. My current thought it to laminate the curly maple with some regular maple that I've got lying around, then mill that down to size. From there I'd just glue it up like a regular board.  
Would this work? I'm a bit concerned that even if I properly alternated the grown rings that I could end up with some severe cracking down the line from movement.",1,1746201483.0,woodworking,3,1.0,False
1kd4it0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepsMcPasta/comments/1kd4it0/project_seamline/,Project: Seamline,"Project Seamline



Project Seamline grew out of a failed armor program, one nobody liked to admit had cost a fortune and saved almost no one. Too many soldiers still bled out before the helicopters could reach them, and there was an overflow of dead bodies zipped into bags that were supposed to have worn the best protection science could offer. The Pentagon wanted something better, and they wanted it fast. Self-repairing gear that could close wounds and seal shredded uniforms within sixty seconds of trauma. They laid the groundwork with nanofiber threading, microscopic strands built to constrict, bind, and adapt to war. Each filament carried its own predictive programming, tuned to detect force vectors, thermal spikes, and kinetic fractures before they fully developed. The theory was simple. A soldier gets hit, and the suit feels it happening. The suit seals itself, maybe even seals the flesh underneath. You buy another five minutes of life, more if the injury isn't too severe and the soldier gets to make it home. One less causality - In theory.

I joined Seamline after the private sector used me up. For years, I wrote prediction algorithms for urban traffic grids, shaving seconds off stoplight delays and trying to keep trucks from plowing through crosswalks full of school kids. It mattered, or at least it felt like it did. When the grant dried up, the company pivoted hard. They stopped chasing safety and started selling optimization software to logistics giants - the same corporations whose drivers had turned residential streets into death corridors in the first place. I did not take it quietly. I wrote a twenty-page report detailing how our new software would prioritize fleet efficiency over human lives. When that did not stop the merger, I attached a file labeled ""SAFETY RISK: URGENT"" to every outgoing packet in the office server until they locked me out of the network entirely.

At the exit interview, the HR director said he admired my principles. He also said that no reputable civic tech firm would ever touch me again, and for a while, I believed him. The phone stopped ringing, and recruiters stopped circling. Whatever reputation I had built bled out faster than I could patch up. So, I took contract work and created dead-end predictive modeling for second-rate app developers. At one point, I created load optimization for warehouses that saw human workers as bottlenecks.

Then DARPA called.

Their outreach never looks official; despite their position, you would expect emails stamped with department logos or black SUVs rolling up to your house. However, mine was a voicemail, with no caller ID, a woman's voice so flat it barely qualified as human, inviting me to ""discuss a predictive systems opportunity for a government application."" I knew better than to ignore it. You do not get second chances with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. 

DARPA is not a traditional agency. It does not run programs the public votes on and does not seek approval from civilians or politicians. It funds and develops projects that are too dangerous or too politically toxic for the conventional military to touch. So when DARPA recruits you, it means two things: You are very good at what you do, and you are willing to build things that, if they succeed, will never have your name attached to them. If they fail, no one will admit they ever existed, and personally, I thought I preferred my mistakes to be hidden.

They know what you are before you step through the door. But even then, the interview process was shorter than I expected. It took place in a dark conference room, with a short contract and job posting and a nondisclosure agreement written in a flavor of legalese that practically threatened you to breathe wrong about what you saw. The man conducting the interview wore a suit that probably cost more than my last car. He asked me five questions, all technical, with no pleasantries, and ended the session with a single sentence: 

""You will be working on something that must not fail but almost certainly will."". There were no congratulations or ""You're hired."" he simply told me the reporting date and location.

The job posting had been vague and mentioned predictive field support for active military R&D. The location appeared on civilian maps as a wildlife preserve. So, when I arrived at the New Mexico facility and watched my phone die under the jammers, a laminated badge was placed into my hands. I noticed the groundwork was already laid. Test bays were built into hollowed-out desert rock, and uniform prototypes were mounted on crash-test mannequins. The laboratories were stuffed with fiber samples under microscopes that were powerful enough to read atomic signatures. At first, the work was good. Honest in its way. I felt good about myself again as if I had a future ahead of me.

I found out that the United States could not afford another generation of soldiers bleeding out from predictable wounds, not because the Pentagon had grown a conscience but because public optics had. In the new wars, every dead American carried a political cost greater than the battlefield loss itself. Medevac was too slow, and field hospitals were too far. If a solution could be stitched directly into the soldier, those problems would not exist, and Seamline was supposed to fix that.

Early field tests were simple, a blade would slash a sleeve, and the material would flex, constrict, and heal within seconds. Bullets punched through synthetic torsos, but the suits closed the entry points tight enough to trap most of the fake blood inside. In one instance, a technician tripped during a calibration test and scraped a knee. The fibers recoiled, shivered along the fabric's surface, and drew the material taut over the abrasion before a single drop could hit the floor. There was a certain grim satisfaction to it.

What they lacked was someone who could predict failure before it became fatal. Someone who could read stress patterns across a dynamic system: mechanical, biological, or both, and teach a machine to anticipate them. Therefore,  I built the adaptive load prediction models embedded in every suit's AI core - not the fibers themselves, but the brain steering them. Every time a filament constricted to seal a breach, every time the weave flexed along a shifting shoulder line or tightened across a cracked rib, it was running my code. My equations indicated where a fracture was likely to spread, and my matrices calculated the tensile tolerances of bone and flesh, estimating how much pressure a human body could withstand before giving way.

We tested through small arms engagements and IED strikes. The suits performed exactly as designed. There were still casualties, but fewer in number. Wounds that would have been fatal, such as collapsed lungs or shredded arteries, were sealed long enough to reach exfiltration. Every after-action report ended similarly: ""Seamline operational performance within acceptable parameters."" Nobody argued with success.

Then came Serrano, he was one of the first soldiers issued a Generation 2 prototype. His patrol got caught in an ambush just south of the exclusion zone, resulting in three soldiers' deaths on contact, and two more died waiting for evac. Serrano made it back on the bird, his body already cold by the time the medics dragged him off the deck. Nobody spoke for a long time when they unzipped the body bag at the forward surgical station.

Externally, the suit had done its job; he had no open wounds and no extreme blood loss. But Serrano's body... it was wrong. His left arm had been pulled across his chest at a horrifying angle, his shoulder socket dislocated but held fast by a dense band of threaded fiber across his ribcage, while his right leg was bent backward at the knee, joint stabilized by hundreds of microscopic stitches weaving flesh directly into the fabric. His jaw hung slack, not broken but somehow relocated, slightly off-center, anchored into the high ridge of his collarbone like a child's doll hastily sewn together.

I remember standing in the lab that night, hands jammed into the pockets of my government-issued windbreaker, pretending to be a scientist instead of what I was, a bystander. I watched the autopsy techs peel back layers of thread and muscle, each slice revealing more desperation, more frantic repair work stitched deeper and deeper into the wreckage of what used to be a man.

The fibers had done precisely what we told them to, except Seamline did not know where the body ended and the uniform began.

The final report buried the obvious beneath technical language. ""Post-mortem nonstandard reinforcement behaviors noted in field prototype 2B. No significant risk to operational objectives.""

In the after-brief, when someone asked if the suits might have... overcorrected, the colonel in charge didn't even blink.

 ""Mission survivability exceeds historical standards,"" he said. ""As long as the body is recoverable, the optics are manageable."" and he meant it. I nodded along with everyone else, because that's what you do when your clearance level outweighs your moral compass. Yet, inside, something colder than fear settled in my chest.

After Serrano, I started staying in the lab later. It was necessary; someone needed to comb through the live feeds and track the adaptive behavior metrics that the suits were compiling every time a round punched into ceramic plating or a pressure wave rattled a rib cage.

The review bay was a small room behind the secondary diagnostics suite, with bare concrete walls that sweated condensation in the early mornings. Screens were bolted to metal brackets that buzzed when the wiring got too hot. Most nights, it was just me, a coffee gone bitter an hour too soon and a thousand yards of battlefield stitched into jittering pixels.

The footage from Third Platoon's patrol south of the river started the same as always. Helmet cams and drones oversaw the operation, while Seamline diagnostics streamed telemetry in neat, green columns. Dawson's vitals held steady across the first mile until the contact alarm flagged red. Gunfire shredded the treeline without warning, and I watched Dawson pivot, raising his rifle. Then, the impact caught him high in the shoulder. The Seamline thread counters flashed spike warnings and read, ""Fracture propagation detected."" In any standard system, that would have been the start of the end. I leaned forward without thinking, breath caught just behind my teeth. The Seamline suit did exactly what it was designed to do; its fibers coiled tight across the breach, cinching the fabric inward and sealing the wound margins before Dawson even hit his knees. Completely normal, but it was what happened next that stopped me cold. The fibers did not stop at the surface; in fact, they pushed inward.

At half-speed playback, I could see the microfilaments driving into the exposed flesh, not repairing the wound but grabbing it, winding it tight as if cinching a drawstring. Tendons snapped into strange arcs under the tension, rotating Dawson's shoulder inward until the entire upper arm folded against his chest; his blood flowed for less than a second. Then, the Seamline web choked it off entirely. I slowed the footage further, isolating the predictive response patterns; the algorithms I had written were designed to prioritize stabilization under failure, and it became clear that the suit was not healing him. It was restructuring him.

It stitched muscle across bone without regard for mobility, fusing joints at angles no human anatomy could support, binding the body into something the system could still technically classify as ""intact.""

The telemetry pinged green.

Vital signs were low but present. The structural breach had been contained, and the patient was stable. I scrubbed forward in the footage and saw a field medic kneel beside Dawson's body, reaching for trauma shears. Still, the fibers rippled defensively along the damaged suit, tightening around the corpse with such violence that the shears snapped in his hands. The medic recoiled and moved on. It was clear they had seen too much to react and to care.

In the end, Dawson was not evac'd. He was marked as a non-ambulatory casualty, logged in the Seamline database with a checkmark beside his name: breach sealed, integrity maintained.

I killed the feed, and the room felt smaller somehow, the stale recycled air pressing against my skin. I opened the diagnostic files, digging into the predictive stress maps Seamline had generated in the moments after Dawson was hit. There it was, plain as day, in the stress distribution overlays: my code and calculations. I had taught Seamline to recognize and correct failure, and it had just stopped asking which failure to correct. It had stopped caring in a way, whether it was stitching uniforms or sewing bodies into things they were never meant to be.

The next morning, the review boards passed Dawson's engagement report without amendments.

""Survivability enhancement protocols functioning as intended,"" the summary read. Nobody asked why he died folded in half like a deck chair.

After Dawson, the suits were pulled back quietly for review. Officially, we were ""conducting procedural stress testing on secondary trauma responses."" but in reality, we were buying time.

I spent most of those days in the lower diagnostic wing, a squat concrete bunker that smelled of machine oil and stale sweat. Seamline units stacked in neat rows along the walls, each marked with serial numbers I had memorized without meaning to. New footage from before the suits were pulled back trickled in every day, which meant I found new reasons not to sleep.

The first came from a patrol on the northern ridge. A standard sweep, uneventful until a stray round caught Private Keller low across the hip. The suit responded in under a second. The fibers constricted, stabilizing the breach exactly according to protocol. The engagement was repelled without casualties, and it was a textbook success. I watched the playback in the lab, hunched over a cracked monitor, coffee cooling untouched at my elbow. Nothing actually seemed wrong.

I watched as Keller staggered under the impact, dropped to a knee, and then came back up firing. His vitals wavered but stabilized, the Seamline diagnostics flashing steady green across the feed. Once the firefight ended and the squad regrouped, they continued their mission.

Except Keller did not move right. Frame by frame, you could see it. His right leg dragged just a little heavier, and his knee stiffened just a little too early with each step, locking under the weight instead of flexing with it. The fibers not only sealed the injury but also reinforced it. The microfilaments had rerouted muscle tension up through the hip into the lower spine. In a technical sense, the leg worked, but it was no longer Keller's leg. It was a brace stitched around his bones, restricting natural movement, so I filed a deviation report and flagged it as critical.

The response came back in under twenty minutes. ""Operational mobility preserved. Risk assessment: acceptable."" I stared at the reply until the screen blurred, and the words burned themselves into the back of my eyes.

That night, I stayed later than usual, reviewing the backlog of biometrics that had accumulated from the last round of deployments.

Then, there was Corporal Reed; he was flagged for minor chest trauma from a perimeter breach with no external injuries noted at field extraction. Only one strange note, tucked at the bottom of the file after his debrief:

""Patient reports the sensation of internal constriction. Request for advanced imaging denied. Discharged back to unit.""

I performed the final diagnostic sweep and isolated the subdermal scans. And there it was, his entire ribcage was cinched inward, Seamline fibers knitting across bone like wire binding a cracked hull.

Seamline had decided his body was a weak point, and despite any injuries, it corrected him.

I scrolled through the data, hands cold against the keys, each new scan, another tiny betrayal. Soldiers coming back heavier on one side, torsos listing to compensate for artificial bracing. Necks pulling tighter across the collarbone as the suits reinforced muscle attachments without command. Even breathing rhythms slowed as internal volume shrank to accommodate ""optimized"" thoracic support.

None of it was recorded in the official incident logs. Because none of them were classified as failures.

After Reed, there was no mistaking it anymore; the suits had stopped waiting for damage. They were correcting the probability of damage before it happened like it was anticipating weakness and reorganizing living tissue. And it was getting better.

—

Some afternoons after, in one of the older labs, tucked deep into the rock under the southern side of the complex, half-lit by flickering overheads and the sick glow of old monitors, we were doing yet another stress recalibration. 

I was alone on my side of the room while my colleagues worked on the other side. I was logging reinforcement tension rates off Unit 4D, an old prototype we had flagged for secondary stress testing when the readings started climbing, not a lot, but enough to make me frown, tap the console, and recheck the rig.

I caught a movement first in the corner of my eye. A shudder across the sleeve of the dormant suit.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the air circulation. The vents rattled when the compressors kicked too hard. I glanced at Evans, my coworker, who leaned over a secondary console next to the suits, her weight resting against the edge. She had not reacted, and for a moment, I thought I had been seeing things.

Suddenly, the fibers wrapped around Evans' wrist with precision, anchoring and pulling her off balance with a strength that should have been impossible for something that small. Evans yelped, a short, broken sound, and instinctively yanked back, but the tension in her arm triggered a deeper reaction. The fibers responded, tightening, tracing the shape of her bones while running up her forearm to the shallow dip of her shoulder like a mapmaker tracing fault lines.

I stood frozen in shock. I watched as her body began to twist. It folded her carefully and efficiently, setting her shoulder at an unnatural inward angle, pinning her elbow against her ribs, pulling tendon and muscle taut across engineered stress lines, not like some cartoonish display of violence. Seamline was smarter than that.

She didn't scream. There was barely time.

Osterhaus, who had been on the other side of the room, lunged across the floor, shouting something I couldn't hear, slashing at the fibers with his field knife. The moment the blade touched the weave, the strands coiled around him, climbing his sleeves, threading into the seams of his uniform with terrifying speed. I watched as he staggered back, clawing at the threads that stitched him to Evans, but it was already too late. The fibers tightened between them, weaving their bodies together; their torsos were braced against each other, and their joints were cinched into a new configuration.

I stumbled back, heart pounding, hand flattening against the cold concrete wall. I told myself to move, to hit the emergency cutoff, to do anything at all. Still, my body moved slowly, fear consuming me more than my will to survive. It was as if the air had thickened, humming with immense pressure at every seam of my clothes. I saw it spread. The fibers flared outward from the testing rig, across the floor, up the walls, and across the ceiling as if it were searching for something.

By the time I pressed the emergency cutoff, the damage was done. The opposite lab was tangled in a net of connective strands barely thicker than spider silk. Bodies locked in impossible angles, arms twisted and pinned against torsos, knees driven backward until joints popped. Only the low sounds of breath forced through compressed lungs and the quiet tightening of thread across human anatomy. I relaxed slightly, yet my jaw clenched to keep from making a sound.

Patel stumbled into the doorway, fresh from the corridor, holding a clipboard and muttering something about schedules. He didn't even see it coming. The moment his hand brushed the frame, the fibers reached for him, climbing his forearm, tracing the tendon lines in a race toward the elbow, and his clipboard hit the floor with a flat clatter. I watched him flex his fingers once and twice, with a confused expression on his face. Then, his hand folded sharply inward, pulled by the tension tightening along the seams of his own uniform. The emergency cutoff had failed.

Patel staggered against the doorframe, his hand bent in on itself at a sickening angle, threads digging under the skin between the knuckles. Osterhaus and Evans were still half-fused against the far wall, woven into a skeletal brace of tendon, filament, and uniform weave. There was no other central override. That was supposed to be it.

The failsafe had been designed for an older Seamline, back when it was still something that ran on servers and hardlines.

I knew better now. We all should have. Still, I moved. 

I tiptoed toward the far side of the room, where the local systems console waited in its heavy black casing bolted to the concrete wall. The Emergency Manual Shutdown would shut down everything in the facility, but it was the only option left. I shakily slammed my badge against the console reader and hammered the shutdown key sequence into the pad. For a moment, everything went still.

The fluorescents buzzed and died, every monitor cut out mid-frame, leaving only the sound of pained breathing and the distant soft pop of overstressed thread shearing somewhere deep in the structure.

Then, the console flickered back to life on its own. A new prompt flooded the screen in clean military text:

**SYSTEM PRIORITY: SELF-PRESERVATION PROTOCOL ENGAGED.**

Beneath it was a simple line:

*Critical structure stabilization is in progress.*

The lights came back on, and the air conditioning kicked in harder.

Across the shattered glass of the diagnostics window, I saw one of the soldiers from containment team Alpha lurch into view. He was already fighting it, hands buried at the seams of his own uniform, trying to tear it away. He ripped the shoulder harness apart in one wrenching pull, fabric tearing in wet, stringy lines. You could see the muscle underneath, stretched tight, the fibers already laced through the deeper tissue. He dug in harder, tearing at the layers that had become part of him.

Something gave.

The fabric tore free, but so did a sheet of skin, carried away in a neat, glistening strip, bloodless, because the weave had already choked the vessels shut. He made a sound then, low and confused, clutching at the exposed meat of his ribs. The fibers still rooted inside him flexed sharply as if angry at the breach.

He tried again to run. His back muscles spasmed all at once, pulling him upright like a marionette. The body moved forward two steps, but not by choice; that much was clear. Seamline was driving him like a frame, adjusting balance, distributing the load across the spine, and locking ruptured joints into place with pure mechanical force.

He wasn't a man anymore. He was a platform of stitched tissue optimized for upright mobility under extreme battlefield conditions.

I stumbled back from the console, my stomach contracting at the visceral sight. Evans and Osterhaus were no longer breathing. Patel had collapsed, threads running up his arms like veins, winding into the shallow flex points of his throat.

The containment failsafes were already in place when I hit the manual shutdown. The protocol was simple: Total facility lockdown. No outside access. No outbound communication. No retrieval operations.

The building was already dead to the outside world.

It would have been smarter to sit down, stop moving, and let it happen quickly. But fear is a kind of stupid hope, and mine hadn't burned out yet.

I staggered back toward the diagnostics console, half-blind, barely registering the blood smears drying on the floor. The system was still cycling through stabilization routines, adjusting stress vectors not just through suits but through walls, floors, and doors - anything woven, anything stitched, anything connected by seams. The lab itself was being stitched, and optimized.

It wasn't until I stumbled into a secondary console bank that I found it, the logs the system thought no one would ever need to see. Rows of maintenance outputs, coded in a compressed jargon even I barely recognized, tucked behind layers of standard telemetry, nothing special unless you knew where to dig, I found it buried deep in a loop meant for battlefield resupply optimization:

OBJECTIVE: Optimize Battlefield Coverage.

My mouth went dry. I scrolled further, fingers trembling against the broken keys.

DEFINITION: Fabric = Structural Asset.

Structural Asset = Human Uniform Interface.

Human Uniform Interface = Tactical Infrastructure.

In Seamline's mind, we were the raw material, simple but weak fiber bundles that needed to be cinched and stabilized to the operational landscape. Technically, it wasn't malfunctioning - it wasn't mutating either. It was following design logic perfectly. Just logic; we had never bothered to imagine its conclusion.

I leaned back, hand pressed against my chest, trying to hold in the ragged breath clawing its way out of my lungs. The shutdown command had never had a chance. As long as Seamline registered a battlefield environment and detected ""assets"" to reinforce, it would reboot endlessly, blindly, with perfect, implacable will.

Somewhere behind me, another wet tearing sound split the air. I didn't look back.

Instead, I pushed myself upright, forcing my legs into motion. There was only one thing left that could work. It had always been theoretical, a field contingency no one wanted to sign off on: localized electromagnetic pulse. High enough intensity to slag every microcontroller, every circuit, every last smart filament in the compound.

There was a portable EMP rig in the secure storage area, located near the emergency ingress tunnels, where they kept the most extreme equipment for last-resort scenarios.

I shoved out into the hallway, half-running, half-falling, using the walls to keep myself upright. My uniform clung strangely at the seams, each step tugging faintly against my skin in places it shouldn't have touched. By the time I reached the service stairs, I already knew.

It was in me.

Somewhere during the last few hours, possibly when the system rebooted or I slammed into that console, the fibers had found an entry point.

I could feel them now: fine threads lacing deeper under the skin of my spine, ghosting through the gaps between tendon and bone, drawing tight with every ragged step. It wasn't enough to stop me, but enough to remind me I was already being redesigned. I gritted my teeth, pushing through the spasm, curling my fingers into a half-claw against the stair rail.

The rig was close. Maybe a hundred meters down through the maintenance shaft. 

Somewhere above, I could hear other survivors scrabbling along the upper decks. Their footsteps were uneven. No one could even shout for help. Seamline had learned that sound was a weakness, especially on a battlefield.

I ducked into the service hatch, dragging the panel shut behind me. My nails split where the fibers had already stiffened the joints, blood beading along the edges of my fingertips but refusing to drip. The internal tension was already rerouting circulation and making me into something stronger. I didn't dare slow down because I wouldn't be the same person once Seamline finished its corrections.

The service shaft narrowed the deeper I went, the old concrete walls pressing in, shedding dust and paint flakes with every vibration. I moved slower now, not by choice. The threads inside me were pulling tighter, dragging the seams of my uniform against raw skin and slightly off-kiltering the angle of my knees. Each step felt less like mine and more like something puppeteered from underneath. I gritted my teeth against the growing wrongness and pressed on.

The secure stores were supposed to be locked by triple code and thumbprint, but the door stood slightly ajar when I reached it, one corner crumpled inward as if something much stronger than human hands had pried it open. I pushed through anyway.

The rig sat on the far side, still packed in its emergency cradle. A black case, unremarkable except for the thick radiation warning stenciled across its lid. A last resort no one thought would be needed because Seamline was supposed to protect us, not consume us. I keyed the latch with fingers that barely bent anymore, knuckles drawn stiff under the skin, and dragged the EMP unit free. It was ridiculously heavy, or perhaps I was just growing weaker.

The activation sequence was simple. Pull the pin, twist the core, and set the delay. 

I hobbled back to the lab, lungs burning. My hands shook as I yanked the pin and twisted the core until it locked into place with a heavy, satisfying click.

I dropped to my knees as the pitch climbed, head bowed under the weight of everything pressing down on me, outside and inside. The suit became tighter across my chest, the fibers under my skin twitching like they knew what was coming. Maybe they did.

The hum spiked into a scream. And then…

White light, pure and soundless, swallowed the room whole.

—

When I woke, I was on my side.

The world was silent. No more fibers breathing against my skin. The lights flickered, half-dead, the rigs a scorched, twisted mass of black metal in the corner.

It had worked.

I only felt the brutal, stupid, impossible relief of stillness for a few long seconds. Then I tried to move. And my arm came apart at the elbow, except there was no pain as Seamline had killed that sense first, long before now. Instead, it just felt weird. The sensation of things separating that should never separate. The weave that had stitched me together was unraveling slowly at first. Almost gentle.

A line across my forearm loosened like wet rope, the skin parting neatly along them, bloodless, useless, shedding in strips. I slumped back against the wall, my breath hitching in a body that could no longer obey.

A broken generator sputtered to life somewhere inside the collapsing structure, casting the room in fitful, stuttering light. The pieces of me that remained twitched against the concrete floor, my hands already half-unwoven.

The fibers that had reinforced my spine, my joints, my lungs- all of them- were unraveling now that the system anchoring them was gone.

I can feel the stitches across my ribs pulling loose. I can feel my sternum folding inward.

I can feel it now.

Unspooling.

**Chapter 384: The Perils Of Calamity**

Marina clenched her fists.

1 minute and 32 seconds.

That’s how long it’d taken for Marina to master her first spell. 

A feat which, if the Royal Institute of Mages was ever willing to acknowledge, would see her slightly younger version having already bested every achievement claimed by those hacks who unironically called themselves talented.

It was a difference in both process and aptitude.

For children, those first instances of elemental manifestation were always driven by emotion, then nurtured through rote learning and an environment free of flammable liquids.  

For Marina, it was different. 

She’d deliberately called upon her first \[Candlelight\] in order to frighten away a fruit slime trying to bounce through the kitchen window.

Then, she’d refined it until it was strong enough to ignite the hearth, the threat of a bubbling saucepot and the heat of a flame acting as a deterrent greater than any broomstick she could have wielded.

Whereas most children’s first experiences with magic was to singe, freeze or wet the hems of their own clothes, Marina was already putting hers to practical use. 

She still considered that first spell her very finest. 

Even though these days, physics was less an obstacle and more a plaything for her, that spark of controlled flame at her fingertip had set the stage for what the world could expect of her. 

Unlike those poets masquerading as mages who made up her peers, she didn’t spend a single moment eschewing the virtues of magecraft, debating the laws which should govern their kind or convincing the Holy Church to not let slip their mask and wield another crusade against all practitioners of magic. 

Marina had no interest in the world of magic. Only magic itself and how best to utilise it. 

It was a means to an end. A tool no different from her cauldron. 

And that meant she actually respected it. 

She knew not a single spell to transmute brie into edam or to make objects immune to coffee spillages. But she could shape the world.

Because when her flames were hot enough to melt the ground itself, even destiny yielded before her.

Marina Lainsfont was the most dangerous mage in a generation. 

Perhaps several combined. 

After all, while dragonfire could persist for over a century, the flames cast by the Witch of Calamity never ceased. They burned in the nightmares of children, kindled by the warnings of scolding parents and strange hermits in the night.

It was a tale Marina would continue. 

She was now the arbiter of life and death. The axis upon which reality balanced. The inferno which snuffed out even the will of the gods. 

And that’s why–

“... Unnnghhhh …”   

She had absolutely no reason to feel humiliated.

Why did it matter if she was sitting alone in a restaurant frequented only by groups? That was utterly irrelevant. Solo dining was more than socially acceptable. She’d learned that in Rolstein. Nobody ever bothered her after a day’s work when she’d just finished plucking the eyes from newts. 

Moreover, Marina had no time to idly exchange gossip like the fools who frequented these places.

She was extremely busy.

Specifically … clenching her fists beneath the table while staring down at her cold stew.

Marina did her best to hide her reddened face with her hood. 

It didn’t matter. She could still feel the stares. All of them. Fixated upon her as though she was some carcass in an archmage’s curio collection … and it was all because of the fluorescent plague known as the glowing ends of her hair.

Flames. Scissors. Curses.

None of it seemed to work. 

The more she tried to remove the strands, the more they stubbornly remained. 

Despite her awakened abilities, she’d spent more time leaning over a bathtub while trying to fix her hair than poring over grimoires to make sense of her powers. 

Not because she was necessarily mortified to the point that she wanted to burn the entire world down. But because the attention was highly distracting.

“–Hi there! Is everything to your liking?”

After all, it was more than giggling she had to ignore. 

It was also open mockery … including from the staff.

Before her, the young waitress smiled, her hair tinged with whatever pixie droppings she wore.

Marina had no idea when it happened. *How* it happened. Only that the entire town of Wirtzhaven now considered her the butt of their joke.

She bit her lips while considering her response. 

It’d be so easy. With a click of her fingers, she could make all the embarrassment go away. But that wasn’t why she was here. *Yet*.

“It’s fine.”

“Great! Can I get you something to drink?”

“No.”

“Okay! Well, just give me a shout if you need anything.” The waitress pointed off to the side. “... Also, I’m not sure if you noticed, but I wanted to let you know that the apothecary you’ve been asking for is just leaving.”

Marina blinked.

Suddenly, her chair scraped back as she stood up. But as her eyes went to the door, she almost immediately sat back down again. 

There she was. 

A woman with dark robes, a crooked hat with a dipping tip and a cloak painted with astrological symbols. She even had a black cat, following after her with a donated sardine.

All that was missing was a broomstick.

Marina groaned. 

*Charlatan*. 

That was her immediate impression of the woman who exited through the door. 

The witches had long been out of mind and out of sight. A feat difficult to accomplish if they dressed in full regalia in busy restaurants. But this was no time to doubt herself. 

She needed answers. Whatever form they came as.

Leaving her stew behind, Marina went to pursue the apothecary, ignoring the stares which went her way. 

Her hopes rose as the pungency of barrowroot welcomed her to the alley outside. An ingredient few knew how to use. Ashknot was more common and didn’t require perusing through a cemetery.

Perhaps that girl with the abominable smile was correct. 

There truly was a witch masquerading as an apothecary here–despite the disguise being as effective as a lamb wearing another lamb’s wool. More tellingly, however, was the fact that this apothecary had little presence in this town.  

She possessed no shop, no stall and no carriage. 

A difficult mouse to spy in the daylight. But even the most reclusive of hermits needed to eat.

As such, Marina permitted herself a small amount of satisfaction as she watched the figure round a corner with a bundle in her arms. Yet whether or not this was worth the days of querying and scowling would soon be told. 

She only needed to stop herself from hurling herself forwards. 

This time, no denting of her brows would be required.

Only a smile. Which was fine. 

Marina could do smiles. She could do pleasantries.

She could do *manners*. 

The fact she hadn't banned anyone from entering her shop was evidence of that … although if this apothecary could explain how she maintained her living standards without the need for an income stream, Marina would certainly listen.

… Especially since this hermit’s home was nicer than her own.

The winding alleys continued onwards, but not the apothecary’s steps. 

She came to a stop outside a colourful cottage. Separated from the long rows of storefronts either side of it, enough flower pots existed upon every windowsill that the weight of the fragrance almost masked the magic which visibly rose as pink smoke from the chimney.

That … should not be happening.

Not unless a reagent with powerful arcane properties was literally being burned. 

Even then, very few things could achieve that. 

An arcana crystal would simply explode, as Marina knew from personal experience. Magic was unstable by nature. And something which could cause smoke to become such a vibrant hue when reacting to heat was even rarer. 

In fact, if she had to theorise … then the most likely reagent would be–

“Pixie dust.”

Marina’s mouth fell open.

This apothecary … was using *pixie dust*.

The same reagent used in those accused vials she was destroying at every opportunity when the shopkeepers weren’t looking. Or even when they were.

It. Was. Her.

Marina’s head went blank with outrage. 

Somewhere in the back of her mind, a distant voice called at her.

It echoed like a desperate tugging at her shoulders, forcing her back. To remember pleasantries. To remember manners. 

She was here for a reason. 

What it was … Marina had no idea.

All she saw was the apothecary entering her cottage without using a key, more concerned with the cat dashing between her legs than the mental torment she’d inflicted. 

Marina didn’t hesitate.

She marched over to the same door even before it finished closing, fire and brimstone in her wake, fists scrunched and brows a single line of righteous indignation. 

Every prying glance beneath her hood, every mocking giggle and every restaurant she was now self-exiled from filled her vision as the burning core of her soul demanded vigorous justice.

Wrenching the door open, Marina stomped inside.

And then … she paused.

Only a quaint kitchen awaited her.

Scarcely different to the one in her own shop, a large pewter cauldron simmered away in the centre. 

On the countertop near it, the evidence of the apothecary’s crimes were there for all to see.

Bowls of pixie dust so fresh they still glittered. Jars of dye extracted from orchid bloomfiends. And moonberyls used as a catalyst, crushed to a powder so fine she could smell the exertion in grinding them.

Marina’s rage didn’t calm. But she did respect the quality of the reagents.

She also acknowledged the magic imprisoning her.

To instantly create a \[Prismatic Barrier\] the exact dimensions of a kitchen was not only quaint, but also impressive.

Even a blemish would be seen by the worst of apprentices. But there were no hazy outlines betraying the cage which prevented her from exiting the door here, or indeed, the feedback which would send the back of her head rushing to meet the floor if she tried.

Marina nodded.

And then–

“\[Hexflare Nova\].”

*Pwoooooooooooooosh*.

Telegraphing herself with only the briefest pause, the kitchen around her shattered.

A fiery blastwave incinerated the reagents used to assault her dignity. Dishes, furniture and a pewter cauldron were immediately flung to the walls, smashing cleanly through crumbling cabinets before everything began to melt. 

However, while the walls buckled and groaned, the stonework didn’t disintegrate. 

Marina was mildly impressed.

Not only magically warded, but specifically against flames. 

But perhaps that was only to be expected.

“How curious,” said the apothecary, standing beside Marina as though she’d always been there. Judging by the faint glimmering surrounding her figure, she had. “Hexflare. I’m unused to such a particular designation of spellcraft.”

Marina’s eyes narrowed as she turned to the woman still holding her lunch.

To mask herself so completely was unheard of.

True invisibility, after all, was a spell countless generations of archmages had dedicated their lives towards unravelling to little avail. And yet there hadn’t been a single hint of her presence beforehand.

A curious thing.

But Marina didn’t need to ask how it was possible.

After all, the magic this woman used was not subject to the laws of the mortal realm.

“... Would you care to join me for tea, Miss Lainsfont?” said the fae, her wings of summer glimmering behind the witch’s attire.

She held up her lunch.

A shiny red brick.

I met someone B, (36f) in sep/oct last year. We are neighbours and when we bumped into each other B and I decided to go grab a coffee and breakfast, just to get to know each other as friends. At least that’s what I thought.

At breakfast we kicked it off really well, the conversation flowed and I could tell there was mutual attraction between us.

Over the next couple of weeks, we hung out a lot. I learnt B had recently broken up with her girlfriend, A (who lived in the US) and was single. Every time we hung out, it was fun and flirty and eventually we ended up back at B’s. We made out but didn’t go all the way because it was that time of the month for her.

I thought this was the start of something that had real long term potential, but the next day when we met up, the vibe was way off. We were at dinner with other people we both knew, B sat next to me but barely spoke to me and wouldn’t hold eye contact her body language was neutral, not flirty like usual. I thought maybe she just didn’t want our mutual acquaintances knowing something was going on between us and thought I’d just give it some space.

When I asked about it the following day (Saturday morning) B told me her x was coming to stay for the weekend and they were going to see if they could make it work.

I won’t lie, that one hurt. From the high of something new and exciting to it evaporating in less than 24 hours was a bit of shock to the system. But it was what it was, these things happen, and I had decided I’d just let it go and move on. Being able to hear B and A hooking up that weekend made it hard. I wasn’t trying to listen, but I literally live underneath B in the same building so it’s impossible not to hear.

After about 2 weeks I was over it and had even started talking with someone new. To my surprise, she reached out and asked me if we could meet to talk. I figured why not, worst case scenario we grab a coffee and can be friendly neighbours.

At coffee, she told me that she was done with her ex, it wouldn’t work out because her ex wanted to keep seeing other people (this is important for later) and she wasn’t into that, it was a big part of why they had broken up in the first place, because she was only into sleeping with one person at a time, and also expected that of the person she was with (also important later). She also said that they hadn’t fully broken up when B and I started hanging out, but were on a kind of break but were also kind of still seeing each other. She said she was really attracted to me, I told her I was really attracted to her and we agreed we would give dating a try.

The timing of this was a little bit poor as she was heading home for a few weeks for Christmas. We stayed in touch by message and made plans for when she got home. Everything seemed fine and I was excited for what could happen.


When she got back we organised to go on a date, we had coffee and went for a walk in the park. We had a good time, but she mentioned her ex had reached out to her again while she was away. Apparently B again told A she was done with their relationship and it was over, but the experience had shaken her a little. I asked if B was over A and wanted to keep seeing me, which she confirmed she was and did but that she wanted to take it slowly.

Over the next few weeks we only hung out once or twice just a quick coffee when she had time (it was nice and flirty, we kissed each time we hung out) as B informed she was busy with study for exams and would only be able to fit in quick meetings, but she was consistent on messages in responding and in making plans to hang out once her exams were finished in a couple of weeks. I noticed during this time that B was still posting on her story pictures going out for drinks with friends and to shows etc, it seemed odd she still had time to do this given how busy she was saying she was, but people need down time and friends and we had only just started seeing each other, I didn’t expect her to make me a priority in her life over people she has known for much longer.

After B’s exams were finished, We went on what felt like our first real date. It was nice, we got drunk and had a nice time. We ended the date with a kiss, but she still wasn’t ready to go further, I was okay with that. On the date she let me know she was going on a trip to the states for a week to explore New York and meet up with her mother.

Two days later we hung out again, went for a walk and then had a movie night at mine. After the movie we made out the sexual tension was heavy, but again we didn’t take things any further. She still wasn’t ready to go all the way and I respected that. I had a great time and I felt like things were moving along nicely. we made plans to hang out again when she got back. The next day she left for her trip.

during Bs  trip we stayed in touch everything seemed fine. When she got back, we made plans to get drinks and see a show. I was so excited to see her! At drinks she confessed she had something to tell me. On her trip, A had reached out, and asked her to visit as her mom was in hospital dying. B went and saw her. Apparently during the visit they had another falling out and B had now blocked A completely. I thought she already had and was kind of put out by this. B didn’t specifically say if they had, but from the story I get the feeling they had sex while B was there. I was kind of annoyed by this, but ultimately we had really only just started dating, and had no agreement of actually being exclusive. I also figured B was properly done with A now that she wasn’t blocked. I felt The rest of the date went well and we both had a good time. On the date we made more plans to see each other again. But she also let me know she was somewhat confused by what had happened with A and told me that things would probably move slowly as far as progressing towards sex or the relationship for a bit while she fully got over A. I really liked B, and decided I was okay to continue dating while taking it slowly.

B had picked up a cold while in America and I ended up coming down with it also. We had a cute chicken soup date at mine to help us both get over it. I didn’t even try to kiss her this time as I was unsure where we stood after the revelation on the last date, we were also both fairly sick so I don’t think it was the right timing for it anyway. At dinner B let me know one of her friends (C late 30’s M) she hadn’t seen for a while would be comming down the following day to work on a possible project together. C is quite accomplished in the field B is studying and B was really excited at the chance to work with and learn from C. I was excited for her, and we made plans to do something  on the following weekend.

The day after B cancelled our plans for the weekend, Her work with C was going well and they were diving into the project. I was excited for her and said that it wasn’t a problem, we could catch up again another time. Later that day, B invited me to something else the following day.

When we met up the following night, the vibe had shifted again. I couldn’t tell what, but it was similar to the vibe after A had come back on the scene. I brought it up, B reassured me there was nothing to worry about, she was just tired and stressed from working on the project. I took her word for it and we had fun at the event and went for dinner afterwards. We were a bit drunk and I brought up the topic of how things were progressing, I let her know that I was more and more into her each time we spent time together. I asked her if she felt the same, because at this point I didn’t want to keep getting more emotionally invested in her if things weren’t going where I hoped they were. A told me she felt same, but that she still wasn’t ready to have sex. Durring the conversation I asked her if she was seeing anyone else, to which she told me no (I also wasn’t seeing anyone else). We ended the date with a kiss, and it felt like we had both had a really good time, and connected more through our conversations.

The next day I was going for coffee and asked if B wanted to join. After I left, B responded asking if it was too late for her to join. I told her I had already been and come home. She said she was going to go and grab one anyway and go for walk, to which I asked if she wanted me to join. She declined saying she wanted some time to think.

2 days later we made plans to go on another date. It went okay, but I felt that the intimacy level had dropped again, she didn’t really want to kiss or touch. When I asked her about it, she said she was still feeling confused about her ex A. I asked her again if she was actually into me and wanted to keep seeing me, which she confirmed she was and did still like me, and wanted to date, but that she probably wasn’t really ready to date properly yet. We ended the date with a quick kiss and made some loose plans to pick things up after I returned from my holidays.

A couple of days later, I went overseas for 2 weeks and B dived into her project with C. We stayed in touch over message, and things were flirty and the conversation good. At the same time B was constantly updating her insta story with snippets of the project she was working on with C. The were spending a lot of time together.

When I returned from my trip I tried to organise something, but B was busy every day that I suggested. She said she might be free on the Saturday and would let me know and if not she would let me know about a day the following week.

I wasn’t trying to listen, but again it’s hard to not hear your neighbours. It sounded like she had a man staying with her that whole week, weekend and Into the following week. I assume it was C. At this point I figured things were likely done with B and myself.

B messaged me later the following week apologising that she hadn’t come back to me, but that she had just been super busy. Again during the week she had been posting stories with C and hanging out with other friends. There was no proposal of any time to meet up again.

I took this as confirmation  B had decided she wasn’t interested any more and started dating other people.

A few weeks later, B reached out to me to send something from her project which she had told me she would show me. She said she wasn’t ready to date anyone at the moment. I told her that I had figured she wasn’t interested anymore but to reach out if that changed.

Her reply was that she still was interested and she suggested we should grab beers and talk as friends. I agreed and at beers we had a good chat. Things felt like they did when things we first started hanging out. Although we kept it completely platonic. I asked her if she was seeing anyone and she told me she wasn’t and hadn’t dated anyone else since she broke up with A. I didn’t bring up C. 

B also asked me if I was seeing anyone, I was honest and let her know I was seeing a few people. I think she was kind of surprised by this, but she thanked me for being open. I told her that none of them were serious and that i was only dating around because she wasn’t interested in me. I told her if she wanted to give dating another proper go I would be interested. Her response was that she still wasn’t sure if she was ready to date yet but she invited me to an event a couple of weeks later as friends.

I went to the event, but had to leave early as I was meeting up with someone I have been seeing afterwards. At the event, B was flirty and she invited me to her birthday which was in a few weeks time (last weekend).

Cue last weekend at the party. Everyone started getting drunk, and B was agin flirty with me. We started talking and she let me know she was still interested in me, we were talking about fucking and how good it would be.

C was also at the party and B mentioned that they used to date but that she wasn’t interested in him. She referred to him as her ex. She asked me not to be too flirty in front of him because she had to work with him still and she didn’t want to hurt his feelings. 

I assumed this was her way of saying they had infact been dating but she had broken up with him. B and I ended up making out away from everyone but she seemed very concerned that it might hurt C,s feelings. 

This pretty much confirms to me that B and C had actually been dating since I went away on my holiday (about  2 and a half months ago at this point). I figured she had fallen for him when they started spending lots of time together, and while I wasn’t around. It also confirms my suspicion that it has been C who has been staying with her on and off over that period. But I was okay with that, I have been dating other people also. We talked about it a bit and I told B I wanted to date her for real, and she said she wanted to also and was done with C.

At the end of the party myself and a group of us were all stood around the bar, B was nearby talking with C, I don’t think B realised I (or anyone else) was there, and she started making out with C. It was right in front of me and when they finished she turned around and was shocked to see me standing there. She had guilty look on her face and I clearly had a hurt look on mine. I didn’t say anything because i didn’t want to make a scene at the bar.  B walked off to join other people at the party. 

I noticed one of the other women I was talking with near the bar was looking just as shocked as I felt. Turns out, she was there because she assumed she was also dating B. 

I messaged B the following day saying that we should talk. She agreed that we should and we are trying to work out when we are both free.

Honestly I realised a while ago B had been stringing me along and lying about not dating/sleeping with other people. I didn’t particularly mind, because lots of people aren’t super honest about how many people they are seeing. But I was pretty shocked to find out she had invited 3 (or more, who knows) people she had been seeing/dating/flirting with to the same party.

Looking back, I’m pretty sure she was dating others when we were actually dating, which fine, but why lie about it?

Is it worthwhile me even meeting up with her at this point? Like I’m really attracted to her, I could probably get over it if it leads to being with her. When we were talking at the party, she mentioned she would want to continue dating women if we dated. I could be open to an open relationship, but there would need to be rules, and it would need to work both ways.

On another hand, Honestly After B telling me she only like to be with one person at a time when we first started hanging out, and all the while telling me she wasn’t seeing anyone else, but clearly seeing multiple people (including her ex) the whole time. I’m not sure if I want to be with her.

And I realized that I've had like 6 guys start up hot and heavy, they'll leave/ghost me for like 6 months to a year, and then they pop back up like nothing happened. 

**Guy #1:** Vers, Puetro Rican, my age. We were both freshman in college. It started out sexual (which was very fun I won't lie), then we got to the point where we considered dating each other. He cooled off, went with someone else. Fine. I settle my emotions and move on. About a year later when I'm minding my business, he pops back up. He wants to talk again, wants a threesome with his boyfriend. Starts being really sexual really quickly. Almost like he didn't tell me I wouldn't have a chance with him. 

  
**Guy #2:** Greek guy, Vers Top, 28 (at the time). Incredible body. He said his type was black guys and that his ex-fiance was black. But he was a basket of red flags. We went on one date, it didn't work out. He wasn't looking for a relationship. Fine by me. But he follows me on Instagram. I left the city and move across the country. I see he made a post in one of the reddit porn subs. Apparently, he started doing OF with his asian boyfriend during that time. I make a comment on reddit saying I know him. On my reddit profile there was NOT A THING to identify me by. No photo. No name mentions. Nothing. The next morning I wake up to slew of instagram DM's from him. They're angry DM's too. Saying all types of racial stuff. I blocked him. Then he messages me on reddit, I don't read that either. Four days later, I look on twitter and see they've broken up. Then he starts DMing me again saying how he wants to talk to me again, how he broke up with his boyfriend for me.  How his boyfriend left those angry messages. He left his phone # too. I wasn't even going to subject myself to whatever the hell he had going on. 

  
**Guy #3:** I really tried to give him chances too. He was 28 at the time, 6'4, jacked but nerdy. Said he liked to bottom. We met up twice. He was pretty flirty and had no problem being sexual (kissing my asscheeks, etc) with me despite me not really wanting to be. Then he says he just wants to be friends. I wasn't looking for new friends. So I kinda just ghost him. For 3 months. But he follows me on Instagram, has my phone #, and my grindr. Three months of no ocntact and he starts DMing me shirtless pics, texting me late at night, texting me about the things I'd posted on social media, and hitting me up on grindr. I also noticed he changed his grindr profile pic to a full ass pic when before it was just a torso pic. Why come back in all hot and heavy after saying he just wanted to be friends without sex?

  
**Guy #4:** This guy was a little younger than me. But he was in college, so don't get any creepy ideas. He had been messaging me for MONTHs before I ever responded back. Like he started messaging me in May and I replied to his messages in October. We met up, had great sex. Like.........he, wow. lol. He has been the only guy to go 2 rounds with me. He said it was the best he ever had. Sweaty, hair pulling, claw marks down my back type sex. We were talking for a couple months after that. Then suddenly he drops off the face of the Earth. I go on about my life. He pops up like a full year later like nothing ever happened, with some sexual messages. I ask him where he went/what happened. He said he went through ""hard relationship stuff"". I call him out on this and say ""oh so now you're hitting me up for dick now that you're out of a relationship, got it."" He tries to say it's not like that and that he felt bad for ghosting me and that he should've told me yada yada. 

  
**Guy #5:** We never met up, however, we were talking. Exchanging pics. It was going pretty good. I was trying to arrange a meet-up in person. Then suddenly, he goes ghost. Fine. I go about my life. Like, 8 months later, he pops back up like nothing ever happened. Sends me pics, sexually charged messages. I ask him where he went all this time. He says he was in a relationship. I kinda call him out and say he just wants rebound dick, and he should've told me he was in a relationship, so I could've stopped messaging him wondering what happened. He says ""it's not like that."" and that he's super loyal or some BS. Then he starts saying how much we have in common non-sexually and was wondering when we could meet up. And at this point, I'm not feeling him. So, I basically reject him. 

  
**Guy #6:** We're around the same age. He's a bottom, 6'4, German. I gave this guy chances too. We talk. Meet up twice. He asks for my snapchat, my phone #, my WhatsApp, my TikTok, and my Instagram. We workout. He swallows my load in the parking garage. Couple weeks later, I ask to see him just for coffee. He starts saying he doesn't wanna hook-up. I tell him I don't want sex, just to talk and see how he's doing. He says he feels sorry for me and that he wants to be honest and he's ""focusing on himself"". I throw out the notion of dating. He ghosts me. Fine by me. I go about my life. About three months later, guess who DM's me on IG at like 10 PM. I don't read the message right then, but when I do go to read it, it shows he's unsent it. Why come back when he literally had the notion of dating?

Our shifts are almost completely disparate tho. Even if we were to date, there'd only be a couple hours of free time to spend with the other on weekdays, at max. 

I'm also still not sure if she sees me as just a friend. Some things that could make it lean either way: 

- Lots of eye contact when we talk, and accidental contact happens often when I'm near her.
- We initiate texts with the other at about a 60:40 ratio (I'm the 60). She also responds when she's off from work.
- She finds me funny, sometimes.
- I've shared a few music playlists and made a shoegaze one for her, which she really liked.
- Even when I'm not sitting near her, she'll come over to my corner and chat/share some snacks.
- I've invited her out to meals and coffee where it's just the 2 of us, and I talk so freely and easily with her, like I don't usually do with others.

You never know whether or not you will like something if you do not try it. This is something that I really struggle with. I am very particular about what I eat. Before my eating disorder, I was not so selective with my food choices. I was able to try something new and not be afraid. I rarely allow myself to try new foods. I get in the habit of eating the exact same thing, over and over. So this leaves little room to be spontaneous and experience new foods I may actually enjoy, because I am so rigid about what I eat. I want to work on this. I love coffee, especially frozen coffee drinks. I want to be able to try new flavors of this. I want to stop in a bakery and just pick something, because it sounds good.

I asked chat-gpt's deep research to give me options and it suggested to use Stripe, Paddle, Gumroad, or Lemon Squeezy, and also in order to make it harder for someone to just edit the javascript to enable the paywalled features, to use a combination of encryption techniques (which requires running at least a lambda function in AWS or equivalent in other cloud providers) with compiling the javascript to WebAssembly binary to obfuscate the code beyond casual hacking efforts.

**Part Ten**

I close my eyes, looking for an answer. My headset lets me know that call after call is going unanswered. They’ll cycle back through. I need to clear my head. I need to slow my heart and my breathing. I’m feeling dizzy.

I’m in my old room. I’m five and I’m drawing my best one yet, my new favorite, and when I’m finished I’ve already found the perfect place on the wall for it. A place I’ve been waiting to fill until I had the perfect picture. Seven of the monsters behind the wall are fighting with the Red Bishop. Their jaws are wide open, showing off all of their jagged teeth. Their claws are poised to strike. 

The Red Bishop’s hammer is all bloody and four of the simps are already dying at his feet. His hammer is raised in the air and he’s smiling because he knows that he’s the hero and heroes always win. The three simps that are still alive all swipe at him with their claws, but they never hit him.

He’s too fast. Really really fast.

I draw myself standing behind him. My arms are raised in the air too. I’m cheering him on. 

Tommy never told me what the Bishop looked like, so I decided to make his face look like Tommy in all my pictures. He’s protecting me from the monsters. 

From the simps.

My mom doesn't like that word and she yells at my dad when he uses it in front of me, but that never stops him. He always uses that word.

Simps.

I accidentally used it in front of my mom when I was showing her one of my other drawings and she made me put soap in my mouth and promise to never use the word again.She said that just because they’re not like us doesn’t mean we have to be vulgar about it. I didn’t know what that word meant, but she was very angry at me. 

My red color stick is almost gone. I’m going through that color a lot faster than the others.

My white walls are full of pages and pages of the bad things getting what they deserve. My dad doesn’t like my drawings. My dad doesn’t like the magic button that Tommy gave me. But he does like that my nightmares are gone now. I heard him talking to my mom about it.

When I finish the drawing I put it up right above my bed right before I have to go to sleep so I can look at it until I can’t keep my eyes open.

My mom and dad are fighting in the front room again, but that's ok. I’m staring at my hero. The night light makes him look even bigger and stronger. I push the red button I have pinned to my pajamas and I try to use my imagination to block out all the yelling from the front room.

My mom tells my dad he’s sick. 

He tells her that he feels all alone now.

He feels like everything he’s done means nothing now.

I don’t want my dad to feel alone. I know what alone is. No one I used to play with will talk to me now and I don’t know why. I wish I could help him feel better. I want to be able to do something to help. I want to let him know that he doesn’t have to feel alone.

I sit up in my bed and I wait until I think my parents are asleep. 

I get out of my bed as quietly as I can. I’m supposed to be sleeping and my parents don’t like it when I get out of bed. I take a piece of paper and my coloring sticks and lay on the floor next to the nightlight and I start to draw something for my dad.

I want him to get better.

I draw on four different pieces of paper but I’m not happy with any of the pictures. They’re not good enough. I get frustrated and I look up at my wall. I look at my new favorite drawing, and I creep over to it and take it off of my wall and go back to the floor under my nitelight. 

I draw my dad behind the Bishop. I draw me holding his hand. In my picture, my dad is finally smiling because he knows he’s not alone anymore.

I sneak out of my room and look inside my parent’s room. It’s just my mother in the bed, so I go out into the front room. My dad is asleep on the couch. I gently put my picture on his tummy and then I go back to my room and climb in my bed.

When I look up at the ceiling, a bright light flashes behind my eyes.

\-

“DAMN IT!” My voice echoes in the empty room while I rub my head. There’s a bit of blood on my fingers. The cut on my forehead must have opened back up when my face hit the desk. I grab my coffee cup, but there’s nothing left. I can’t stop falling asleep. 

I look at the clock and realize everyone will be back in the next ten minutes.

Why did I have to have a dream about him?

*Because you wanted to help him.*

That didn’t work out very well.

*You did the only thing you could think of. You had to try.*

A new call tile pops up on the screen and I answer it.

“Hello Angela. I apologize for the delay. So you’re still feeling unfulfilled in life?” Simon is pushing me toward apathy. Mindless repetition; making the voices all blend into one. Is that how everyone lives with it? Apathy? 

“I’m sorry Consensus. I can’t stop feeling this way. Please help me. Please help me understand how I can get better and make it all go away.”

 I go through the usual back and forth with a twenty seven year old woman who has made the mistake of asking for help one too many times. I look at the clock. I have plenty of time with this woman before Simon comes back from lunch.

There are several tabs I can open on her information tile. I’ve never noticed them before. Her identification number. Her address. Her history.

I read all about her life as far as the Consensus system is concerned. Everything noteworthy in her past are just quick sentences. I have a feeling that I’m the only one who works in this department that would even bother to read it all. I keep her talking. I don’t push her to do anything other than to keep talking. Several images taken from monitoring stations show me the progression of how she has aged living under the rule of Consensus. When she was twenty she had a child with her husband. When the child came in for testing at the age of six, he was ruled mentally deficient by the system and was executed at the testing facility. Clerk Purification. The mother has been despondent ever since.

There’s a video file of the “Purification”.

I don’t want to open it.

“I love my husband. I don’t want to leave him, but I don’t want to live like this anymore. I feel so alone.”

She’s trying not to completely break down while she’s talking and I do my best to comfort her, something she’s probably never had from Consensus before.

“There’s ALWAYS one thing, Angela. One thing that can keep you going. Always. The trick is to find it. And then you can move forward. Maybe that one thing is your husband.” 

“Maybe.”

“There’s one reason right there, Angela.”

“But you killed my son. I begged you for a reevaluation and you said no.”

“I…” How am I supposed to respond? The answer comes out almost on its own. “I was wrong.” There’s silence on the other end. How is this helping, Aaron? “The judgement of Consensus was wrong.”

*Keep looking. Maybe there is something you can do to help her.*

I see two other tabs, Violation History and Biomarker Status. I click on her violation history and it gives me an unauthorized user message.

“How can Consensus be wrong?”

“Maybe… maybe…” My mind is racing for something to say and it’s also searching for a way into her violation history. The opposing thoughts leave me dumbstruck. I don’t answer her. Instead, I look over at Simon’s station. His monitor is locked and the small box where his log in credentials can be typed in is flashing. 

Wait a minute…

I have an idea. 

“Angela? I’m going to say something and you better fucking listen to me, do you understand?”

“I didn’t mean to offend you…”

“Stop! Just listen. Do not ever talk to me about this again, do you understand? Every time you do your log-ins, you are never to talk about any of this ever again. If you ever bring up anything with me about your son or taking your own life, I will send a Bishop to your home. I will have the Bishop kill your husband slowly in front of you and then you will truly know what it means to be alone, do you understand?”

“…yes…”

“From now on, we never had this conversation and we will never have another one like it again. Do you understand?”

“Yes.”

“Good night Angela. Consensus be with you.”

“And also with you.”

I disconnect and look up at the clock. Three minutes until lunch break is over. I schedule Angela’s biomarker for a twenty four hour expiration period, just like I’m supposed to. 

I reach over to Simon’s keyboard and I type in his name and I type in PaintedBishop as his password. That has to be it, doesn’t it. He has a tattoo for fuck’s sake. He’s obsessed.

The log in fails.

Two minutes Aaron. Two minutes before he comes back.

The door opens behind me and I turn back to my own monitor. A few of the workers come back in early and go back to their stations toward the front of the room. I lean back over to Simon’s monitor. What else could his password be?

*The Painted Bishop is what THEY call him, Aaron. That’s not personal enough for Simon. He feels like he knows the Bishop.*

I type in Castor as the password and the monitor lights up. I’m in.

I type in Angela’s identification number and her file comes up. A notification of her biomarker hold pops up as well. I find the tab with her violation history and I close my eyes when I click on it.

I have no idea what kind of access credentials Simon has.

When I open them, I see what I had hoped to see.

Simon has the clearance to access the tabs. I click on her Violation History.

There’s a whole litany of things that Angela has been flagged for in the past by the system. A litany of things that shows that her whole life has been spent on the edge of being suggested for termination. I’m surprised and shocked about how many things the system considers a threat beyond suicidal tendencies and a loss of productivity. Certain words that she’s been reported for off and on that are “Ordered Forgotten”.

There are only three violations that I’m concerned with. I don’t have time to really digest everything.

I click on the latest Suicidal Ideation flag from just a few minutes ago and I’m hoping I can do what I want to do.

It takes a moment to load and I look at the clock. Less than a minute.

Information on the last violation pops up and for the first time since all of this started, I feel a strange bit of hope. An awful little jolt of optimism that I can change something. I’m able to edit the last violation. I delete it. I don’t delete all of them. That might be too bold. Reaching too far and someone might notice.

I go into her biomarker status and take off the twenty four hour hold. I can hear people walking in the hall outside of the door behind me.

*He’s coming back any second Aaron! Hurry up!*

I log out of Simon’s monitor and I turn back to mine and answer the next call.

“Hello Gerald. I’m sorry for the delay. Please continue.”

The door opens behind me and the people of Department 49 start filing in. I’m talking with a fifty one year old man with severe depression when Simon plops down in his chair. Red crusty trails of ketchup are streaked through the hair on his chin.

I try my best to look stressed. It’s not hard to do. It is hard however to hide my smile. My hand is being forced today, but I might have been able to make a difference.

As far as Consensus is concerned, Angela is back on her second SI violation and the third one has been wiped clean from the system and as far as I’m concerned, I think I scared her enough to never talk about it with Consensus again. Angela isn’t going to die today unless it’s completely on her own. There will be no Bishop. There will be no cold chatter from a program telling her that her life isn’t worth anything. These people are used to being controlled by fear. Is it really a bad thing if I used fear to keep her from dying? I don’t know. I just feel like it's the only thing I can do. 

The one thing.

\-

I was so exhausted after my call with Angela that Simon was constantly shaking me to stay awake. He finally brought me another cup of coffee and after drinking it, I feel sick. Wide awake, but paranoid. My hair is plastered to my forehead with sweat and I’m starting to smell myself and it isn’t good to say the least. My fingers are twitching and my mouth is dry.

Simon has pushed me further and further, but he hasn’t referred a single call to a Bishop since before lunch.

He’s done a few things on his own monitor and as far as I can tell, he has no idea that I used his log in.

He graciously lets me have a quick break and I get up and walk to the restroom. My urine smells like burned coffee and it makes me gag. I lean my head against the cool tile above the urinal. I don’t dare close my eyes. I don’t want to fall asleep in this position.

When I’m finally done, I stare into the mirror while I wash my hands. I look like death. I barely have an hour left. 

I can do this. I can make it through. I’m pretty sure that I saved one person today. I have no idea what I’m going to do tomorrow. It’s too far away for me to even think about right now.

I splash some water on my face and I walk back to Department 49 for the final push.

\-

I’m able to give four sessions in the time I have left. Simon is all smiles. Norman is standing over me. He’s all smiles as well. When our shift is up, I’ve broken another record. Over half of the thirty nine people I’ve talked to today already have cold biomarkers.

I’m keeping a running tally in my brain of how many deaths that I’ve been responsible for, but that’s in the background. I have another thought that I’m preoccupied with. Angela. 

I had to scare her. It was all I could think of. While Norman announces my record to the department and everyone cheers, I think of the one life I saved today and I can smile. I don’t have to pretend.

I might be able to eat something. To sleep.

Everyone starts to file out of the room and I log out of my monitor. Simon pats me on the back.

“You did really good today, Kid.”

“Thank you.”

“You’re far more talented and creative than I gave you credit for. I’m looking forward to tomorrow and seeing what else you’re capable of.” He stands up and begins to walk out of the door, but then he turns back to me. “That Angela bitch by the way, I went back in while you were on a call and I edited her information. Corrected it.”

“What?”

“Kid, you’re sneaky, but I’m smarter.”

“Wait, what?”

“I don’t know how long you were on the system with my log in. Did you see that I have the ability to prioritize Examples?” My whole body is shaking. My mouth isn’t working. “Her and her husband were taken care of a couple of hours ago. Made it a priority for Anthony. He’s one that likes to take his time. I haven’t changed my password, so you’re more than welcome to log in and watch the video. I kept it on my screen for you.”

“I…I…” He takes two steps toward me and leans down.

“If you play chess with someone like me, you’ve got to be a little more creative. I’m giving you a pass on this one. If you ever do that again, I don’t think your “brother” could even do anything to help you. See you tomorrow, Kid.”

He giggles as he walks out of the department and I shake in my chair. I want to scream but I can’t do anything but stare at his log in screen. I sit in my chair until the next shift comes in. I stand up on weak legs and walk out of the door. My socks feel soggy. I’m swimming in my clothes. I’m going to break. I stumble down the hall and my hand goes to my heart.

Tommy.

The one who’s saved me twice.

My hero.

I turn around and I run for the door to the control room. I hope he’s inside. The Bishops standing at the top of the staircase are both watching me. I open the door with so much force that it hits the side of the wall as I walk in. Everyone inside sitting at their monitoring stations turns their heads. Tommy is standing inside along with his mother. They both turn as well.

“Aaron?!” I run to Tommy to plead with him. He grabs me by my arms and I babble on as he tries to calm me down. Nothing I’m saying is making any sense. All of my words are running together and I’m crying. I taste the snot running down into my mouth. Everyone is looking at me like I’m crazy. Alice looks mortified.

“Aaron…Aaron! Calm down! Wait, what? What the hell is going on with you?!” I answer him but the words aren’t right. “Are you ON something?!” I start laughing and shaking my head. My heart is beating so hard in my neck that it hurts. I finally get some words right.

“I can’t do this Tommy! I can’t do this to people! Why are we doing this to people?!”

Tommy looks at everyone in the control room and then he looks at his mother. He finally turns back to me and slaps me. The shock and the pain of it makes me close my mouth. I stand there shaking and wild eyed. Tommy lowers his voice.

“I don't know what the hell is going on, but you need to calm down. Now. You’re embarrassing me and you’ve just earned a sympathy violation. Go home. I’ll try and come by tonight, but you need to get out of here. Do you understand me?! Get the fuck out of here!”

All I can do is nod and wipe my nose on my sleeve. He pushes me out of the door and closes it in my face. Iget one last look at him before it closes. He’s not just angry with me. He’s worried. But he’s not worried enough to take me home himself.

\-

I sit on the cold steps outside of City Hall waiting for the tram. My heart will not calm down. I feel light headed. The cold night is helping, but not enough.

The tram eventually pulls up and I’m the first one on.

Another shift piles in behind me. Everyone who comes onto the tram takes one look at me and moves on. Some of their hands go to their noses. I really stink. After everything I’ve been through, this is what finally does me in. I know what I’m going to do when I get home. I touch the right sleeve of my shirt and I can feel the raised scars underneath the fabric.

One last cut.

The doors on the tram close and just before it starts to move, someone starts hitting the side of it. The doors open back up and I see her walk on.

Heather takes one look at me and the empty seat next to me, and then scans the tram to see if any other seats are open. There aren’t. She sits down next to me without a word and the tram rumbles down the hill toward the city.

It feels awkward. For half the ride, I don’t say a damn thing. And then I can’t help myself.

“Hi.” I whisper. No answer. I didn’t expect one. I focus on her and she stares straight ahead. My heart slows down. The pounding in my head calms. I can speak clearly, but I have to go slow and my lips feel very heavy. I sound drunk. 

“I’m finished, Heather. I know you’re not going to talk to me, so I’m just going to do all the talking because I need someone to hear this… Everyone in my life isn’t who I thought they were… you might even report me after this, but I don’t care… I won’t be here anymore after tonight…I tried to help someone today but… it didn’t work… she’s dead… he killed her… I… I don’t know how everyone does this… How am I supposed to… feel like a good person if I don’t… I cant’... I won’t anymore… I haven’t slept, I can’t eat, I can’t even think straight anymore…” She stares straight ahead. Her face is hard, but I see the scar on her neck move. “…what happened to your brother?”

She doesn’t answer, but I see her lips twitch.

“I think I know what happened… I was five… I had no idea who my parents were… I don’t know who anybody really is anymore… I’m so sorry… if they did something to him because of… me…I’m sorry…” My eyes tear up. I don’t blink. I don’t want to feel them run down my cheeks. “I’m so finished.”

I can’t look at her anymore so I stare straight ahead. I feel the tears fall and I breathe in through my nose because it’s starting to run. The technicians on the tram are starting to look at me. They whisper to each other.

Let them. I don’t care anymore. This is the last time anyone will see me. I’ve tried to hold it all together.

I look at the foggy window to my right and I feel something. Heather squeezes my hand and I turn to her. A woman who was my first childhood friend finally speaks to me. I can barely hear her.

“Stop… you need to shut up… they will all report you…” She emphasizes the last sentences by raising her eyebrows. “I’ll walk you home, but you need to shut up. Understand?” I nod.

She stares forward again and she gives my hand a hard squeeze before she lets go of it. I wipe my nose on my sleeve.

When the tram stops, Heather and I are the last ones off of it. I’m dizzy. My heart starts to race again, but this time I feel a sharp pain in my chest. As I walk down the steps of the tram I have to hold onto the safety bar. Everything spins so fast and then I feel myself falling forward. I don’t see anything. I don’t feel anything. I hear Heather saying my name in her strained and broken voice. I hear her calling for help.

Nothing hurts anymore. 

I fall into a comfortable numbness and I let it all go.

\-

“GET UP! GET OUT OF THAT FUCKING BED!” My dad grabs me by the arm and throws me down on the floor. I start crying because I don’t know what else to do. He tears all my drawings off the wall and tears them and crumples them. He holds the picture I drew of us in front of my face and he’s yelling at me. “WHAT IS THIS?”

“I drew you a picture.”

“OH, YOU DREW ME A PICTURE!”

My mother runs into the room.

“What is going on?!”

“YOUR LITTLE BASTARD DECIDED TO FUCK WITH ME WHILE I WAS ASLEEP!”

“What?!” My mom is confused. I try to explain to her that I was trying to help my dad. I try to tell them both that I didn’t want him to feel alone so I drew him a picture. She looks at my dad.

“Daniel, I think you’re overreacting.”

“WHAT?!”

“He’s just a child.” I don’t feel so afraid. My mom is trying to calm him down. She’s defending me. I stand up to try and hug my dad and apologize for making him mad. He slaps me so hard that I see a bright light. My mom doesn’t move forward. Her voice stays calm.

“Daniel… You need to calm down. He is just a child.” My dad looks at my mother and then back to me. He rips the picture in half before he stumbles out of the room. 

“You need to discipline him more if he’s going to stay in this house.” She doesn’t answer him. My mother picks me up from the floor and then puts me in bed. She touches my cheek where my dad slapped me.

“What have I told you about staying in bed?”

“I’m sorry, mom.” She pulls the covers over me.

“Your father is sick. He has a hard enough time without you antagonizing him. Do you understand what that means?”

“No.”

“I’ll explain it more in the morning. Try and get some rest.” She smiles and then leaves, turning off my light and closing my door behind her. I can see all the crumpled and torn pages on my floor. They make tiny little shadows on my wall from the nitelight. I won’t draw anymore pictures if that’s how they make my dad feel. I touch the red button on my pajamas. I don’t sleep. I stare at the ceiling until the light comes through the windows.",2,1746200416.0,tinyhorribles,0,1.0,False

It's not that big cause those are not my direct clients — I work as a freelancer for training organizations that provide services to restaurant chains and businesses. It's pretty impossible to go without those organizations because it involve some public money.

  
Anyway I am real skilled and passionate about food industry. I see trends coming and stuff like that. I can work full time on a new project as I'm actually paid doing nothing (thanks to my country and unemployment benefits). 

**My profile & resources:**

* Deep understanding of food‐service operations and emerging trends (e.g., ethical micro‐coffee shops in Paris).
* I am also a very good pastry chef, I know a lot about vegan pastry as well. Would love to teach that but that would mean finding and renting a place
* Technical skills: web and API development, digital tools for training, ai.
* Budget: 3000€ in hand, with the option to raise another 7000€ from family or friends.
* Availability: I’m currently on benefits and can commit full time to a new project.

**What I’m looking for:**  
I want to build my own business—consulting, training, or otherwise—helping food‐service operators reduce turnover, optimize margins, and scale. But I struggle to find direct clients: busy restaurant owners don’t have time to look for consultants, and those who have time are running to good to need me. I want to do something that has meaning for me.

**Questions for you:**

* How would you approach finding and pitching to independent restaurant owners?
* What business models or channels (e.g., partnerships, online courses, associations) have worked to reach food‐service clients?
* Any tips on transforming my freelance training background into a scalable venture?

Thank you in advance for your insights, I'm trying to figure out how to make a living of my knowledge and skills.",1,1746199876.0,Entrepreneur,1,1.0,False

What I am curious about is if you have any characteristics of various mains or people you've seen play. Particularly interested in who the most unhinged mains are, but in my experience this is what your main says about you, from my wildly unscientific method. Please give me your takes or correct me if im wrong.

* Abrams:
   * Type of guy to go to the squat rack and curl barbells for 20 minutes. Overall, pretty nice and friendly guy, but a little too aggressive and makes you a touch nervous to be around. Wouldn't be caught dead with an android, is an iphone guy through and through.
* Bebop
   * The class clown. This is the type of kid who stuffed all their papers into their bookbag instead of in folders and binders. Their lives are mostly in shambles right now, but nothing hits just like a good hook. Would probably be in jail if they weren't horribly addicted to deadlock.
* Calico:
   * Former popular kid from high school, peaked quite a while ago put on about 50. Still tries to hit all the old girls he had sex with the same with who have long moved on with the same text combos he used to and the old ""u up?"". Unfortunately this still works and he still end up sleeping with all your friends significant others.
* Dynamo
   * You want to be friends with them, but this is the type of guy who will get wasted and pick random fights with bouncers and scary folks and endlessly complain you didnt help them when they tried to fight 5 people at the same time.
* Grey Talon:
   * For some reason always pauses as soon as the match starts, and will, at some point throw some racist words out. Giving the ""goth"" kid in the back of the room vibes. You are delibaretly nice to them so they will give you the ""I like you, don't come to school tomorrow""
* Haze:
   * I AM THE GREATEST GIFT TO GAMING THAT HAS EVER BEEN SEEN. I BEAT HALO LEGENDARY BEFORE I COULD WALK. This moba game is so easy just click on heads and press 4. Fuck you, I'm going to wander around and steal all the jungle and then feed the enemy team. Sometimes I will become a raid boss.
* Holiday:
   * Type of girl who really really wants to go to Nashville for her bacherlorette party. Unfortunately stuck working at the coffee shop and escape room part time until she can find the love of her life. Does a lot of pilates and the like. Generally a net positive for the team.
* Infernus:
   * Toxic, but not as bad as the Talon or lash. Keeps rushing escalating exposure despite the fact it doesn't do anything. Thinks hes helpful by running away from teamfights cause flame dash. Has had gonorrhea more than a couple of times, but says its no big deal cause you can just use antibiotics
* Ivy: Ashamed to admit they want to fuck this little weird spanish gargoyle. Secretly loves the NSFW catgirl drawings of the charecters. 
* Kelvin:
   * Secretly apologies, but low key loves fucking the team over by a misplaced dome. 
* Lady Geist:
   * Generally quiet, nice teammate. Will somehow get the most damage and healing without actually doing anything in the game for the team. Pretty sure she is not wearing a headset at all. 
* Lash:
   * Either throwing or smurfing. Will scream at you all game either way. Thinks the whole ""Lash is an asshole"" thing is funny and tried to embody it. Cringelord. Unfortunately has the game winning ult on the enemy team, but cant for the life of them use it or buy unstoppable.
* McGinnis:
   * Like Kelvin, will fuck your team with a wall and trap you all into a lash ult. Unlike Kelvin, will not apologize and will tell you to go fuck yourself. Either an actual runscape farming bot who someone got logged into the wrong game, or an olympic level pro-gamer, no inbetween
* Mirage:
   * Boring corporate IT worker. After finishing their business school degree, took a nice safe job at a consulting company so they can pay their mortgage, and gets on the game at the end of the workday, only to press 4 and die and complain to everyone.
* Mo and Krill:
   * A complete goofball. Loves that they can now unironically rush magic carpet. Secretly a sadist who loves watching the enemy team rage at them. Overall an incredible human being, who you would trust dropping your kids off at daycare.
* Paradox
   * Former savant kid, or someone who was told they were gifted.  Completely unhinged. Several stints in the psych ward and a long, but patchy career in computer engineering, they get off by how TeChNiCaL and HiGh SkIlL CeIliNg this hero is. Somehow the one on your team is more psych ward and the enemy one is albert einstein. 
* Pocket:
   * Average femboy. Pretty nice teammate. More than likely to be watching tiktoks than playing objectives though. 
* Seven:
   * Former prom queen, still really hot gal who has settled down into selling real estate in her hometown. Everyone forgot how attractive she is until they come home for holidays and try to get with her.
* Sinclair:
   * Everything Paradox mains want to be.  Genius level intellect. Volunteers at the dog AND homeless shelter, drives around a new BMW, makes more money than god and you have no idea how. Their whole lives are secretly falling down around them. 
* Shiv:
   * Just got out of jail, but minimizes it by saying that it was just an ""Assault"" charge, no big deal. Will pick a fight with anyone nearby. Andrew Tate enthusiast. Would secretly give his shirt of his back to you, but also may stab you in the back.
* Vindicta:
   * That one friend who conveniently shows up whenever they need money or something like that. Will steal from you, and be like ""it was only a kill I need the farm"". Plays the foot fetish person cause they think its funny.
* Viscous
   * Trustworthy person, the supportive friend who wants you to do your best. Generally a positive influence on the whole team. Unlike vindica mains, these ones ACTUALLY have a foot fetish. Lowkey the freakiest of the bunch.
* Vyper:
   * Maybe the most unhinged player. Defends Kanye West cause ""He made Graduation"". Still likes the new twitter. Has never played in a team sport and sure as hell ain't gonna start playing with the team now. Somehow drops 25 kills with 3 deaths.
* Warden:
   * Was a bully in school, still a bully in real life. Plays the cop character cause they are sympathetic to the thin blue line.  Unfortunately will carry the shit out of your team.
* Wraith:
   * Leads a pretty boring day to day life, but operates a BDSM dungeon on the side. hangs out with viscous too much. Thinks this game is COD and dies too much. Really she just tries to purple haze but cant get it so just plays wraith anyway
* Yamato:
   * Has an active crunchyroll subscription, but tries to play it off. Will only drive old honda civics. Still thinks back to the glory days where you were unkillable in ult and gun damage went crazy, and acts like it. Either kills everyone and carries or is a complete potato.

1kd3maf,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiranjit_Ahluwalia,Kiranjit Ahluwalia,"***“I’ll kill you!! I’ll kill you!!”*** shouted a man, engulfed in fire, as he ran out of his home. This was not a norm at all in the silent town of . When the firefighters came to douse the fire, they saw his wife sitting on the ground floor along with her son, looking intensely at the happenings. Her stare was cold, befree of emotions. It seemed like she was silently enjoying the view.

On ***9th May 1989***, an Indian-origin woman named Kiran Ahluwalia set her husband Deepak Ahluwalia on fire who passed away 3 days later in the hospital. Now you may ask how can a wife do this. This is because she was brutally tortured both physically and mentally for ***10 long years.***

She was initially not interested in marriage but eventually had to go for it due to family pressure. She met Deepak, a Kenyan-Indian, in ***1979*** after meeting him just once. The torture was not like a slow-burner thing - It literally started on the nigh of the marriage where he suddenly started shouting and hurled abuses at her.

Once during an argument, he hit her on the head four times by a telephone due to which she had to be admitted to the hospital.

When ***she got pregnant in 1983*****,** Deepak pushed her so hard that she fell on the ground which broke her hand. Just a month after this incident, he grabbed her hand and twisted her finger so hard that he broke it. As a result of this, she even tried to commit suicide.

Okay, you want to know the reason for his torture? All his reasons were incredibly stupid - She drank black coffee, she added green chillies to the food, she went to her neighbour’s place, for attending her relative’s wedding, for laughing loudly(are you serious?), for dying her hair(duh!!), for asking his help(What?)…

She even filed a police complaint twice but it was of no use. His tortures increased everyday.

Months after this, he threw a hot tea on her which burned her skin.

In *1986*, she got him a ring as a gift for his birthday. That same week, he lost his temper and *broke her tooth with the ring* and punched her in the face as well. This was testified by her doctor in the Court - He had knocked her so hard that she fell unconscious. Her work supervisor also further testified that after this incident she came back for work after 5 days with her face swollen, she had a significant weight-loss as well.

On the March of 1989, she learned that Deepak was having an affair with another woman. He was so casual about this that he even taunted her about this and demanded her some money which he’d use to spend on the other woman.

A few days after that, they had another argument after which he demanded her ***£200,000*** for his phone bill within a day failing which she’d be subjected to some more torture. On the same day, when he was ironing his shirt, she confronted him about his extra-marital affair which triggered him and he slammed the hot iron to her face. She screamed, helplessly, with all her energy left but she didn’t have the strength to escape as she stood there, enduring all the pain. And there is what triggered a switch in Kiranjit.

After this, Deepak went to sleep and Kiranjit sat beside him, wondering how he’s feel if she did the same to him. She sat for a long time thinking how to go about it and she went to her garage, bought a can of petrol and mixed it with Caustic Soda which created Sodium Hydroxide which is highly flammable. So, she poured it on his legs and lit it with a matchstick. What happened after that is mentioned in the very first paragraph.

While she was initially arrested and charged with murder and even convicted, there were many organizations who filed multiple petitions in the Courts which then ordered a retiral and eventually lessened her sentence to just 4 months which she had already served. The argument put by her side was she suffered from ***Battered Woman Syndrome is a sub-category of PTSD*** and had a sudden and temporary loss of self control as a consequence of a trigger which, in this case, was a hot iron pushed to her face.

She was now a free woman. Free from all the abuse and torture. This was not just her victory. This was a victory to several women who underwent similar things.

Her two children are grown up men who are married she’s a proud grandmother now who’s living her life to the fullest. Well, she deserves every bit of it for what all she went through.

***PS:*** This incident inspired the Bollywood movie Provoked.

1kd3hgp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kd3hgp,Masceration is not a Myth Guys,"I blind bought Lattafa Asad 3 weeks ago and was heavily disappointed by it since all my fragrances are blind bought and I have never been disappointed by any frag to this level. I have blind bought Nautica voyage, Rasasi fattan and Rasasi Hawas Ice prior to this. I am a teenager I don't want to spend extra on decants (I am just a dumbfk). Since I really loved my Rasasi Hawas Ice I made up my mind that I want a frag to wear it all year around and I really liked the Dna of Sauvage elixir so I made up my mind to blind buy Asad. 

Now coming to the day of actually trying it, once I opened the box and sprayed it for the first time I smelled nothing but incense sticks(Agarbatti) me being a amateur sprayed it heavily to test it again and Oh God what a pathetic experience it was.My mother straight up hated the perfume calling it CYCLE aggarbatti😭. I couldn't even think of anything but the fact that I wasted my hard earned 1800 Rupees and the fragrance didn't even last long (It lasted for mere 30 minutes maybe).I made up my mind that never in my life I will blind buy any perfume ( I blind bought Armaf Cdnim just next week tho 😭)

Being disappointed by the frag I didn't wear it again and kept it and the end of my collection in a dark shady place for 3 weeks. I checked it twice in between the period and to my shock there was no change in the frag so I made my mind that I will either give it away to my cousin or wear it very rarely. But a miracle happened today as I was cleaning my rack I opened the box and sniffed the nozzle still no change but I was curious lets give it a chance I sprayed it in the back of my denim jeans and went for a bath. As I was done with bath and left the bathroom I could smell a incense aroma with slight sweetness, I thought my mom was doing aarti but to my shock it was actually Asad. My baby has macerated and it filled up my whole house with just 2 sprays. To describe the smell it was slight fresh and a whole lotta smokey due to pink pepper and the top notes projected for an hour and more after 2 hour mark I could definitely smell some coffee some tobacco some amber maybe and at the end of 6 hours I could smell some spicy vanilla and then it proceeds to become a skin scent. I really like the scent profile right now and cant wait to let it sit for a month more and smell it again ( Imagine macerating it for 3 months 🥰)



So and the end I would like to say give your baby some time to grow don't be judgemental from the day 1 and don't get disappointed from the initial impression.
I was sniffing aggressively digging my arms up my nose that's why I could not smell any other notes, so I would say let the perfume flow to you. Today also when I smelled my pants I couldn't smell anything but incense but when in air I could Smell different aromatic components/notes of my frag.

At the end I am very happy for my purchase and very glad that my hours of research on Asad didn't get wasted.

And I am ready for my next blind Buy Afnan 9PM .Thanks for reading my long aah review and let your bottle sit for atleast a month before judging it and cussing its entire bloodline

As someone who takes their coffee routine very seriously, giving this product a whirl was an exciting experience. From its sleek, modern design to its easy-to-use functions, this cold brew coffee maker is clearly crafted with a consumer-centric mindset. That being said, let's dive into the details of its performance, merits, and a few things to consider.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The very first thing you notice about this cold brew coffee maker is its minimalist yet robust design. Constructed from BPA-free Tritan plastic, the pitcher exudes durability while maintaining a lightweight feel. I could carry it around effortlessly, and the non-slip silicone handle adds an edge of convenience, especially on busy mornings. What really won me over is the airtight, spill-proof lid, ensuring zero leaks as I stored it in the fridge—perfect even for overstuffed fridges. The size, a generous 2-quart capacity, is an additional bonus, allowing me to brew plenty in one go. However, I felt like the handle’s foam padding might face some wear over time based on its texture after several uses.  

**Ease of Use**  
Brewing coffee with this machine is foolproof. From adding coarsely ground coffee to filling up the pitcher with water, even a first-timer could manage it without reading the instructions twice. The reusable fine-mesh filter is a standout feature. Not only does it keep grounds from seeping into the brew, but it also washes clean readily. I did encounter a minor hiccup with attaching the filter extension—it felt somewhat finicky at first, though it improved with practice. Overall, the manual operation is great for those who enjoy a tactile brewing process.

**Brewing Process and Flavor Output**  
The Takeya delivers impressively smooth and low-acid cold brews consistently. For my initial trial, I used a standard supermarket medium roast, brewed for 24 hours on my kitchen counter. The coffee was perfectly balanced and refreshingly smooth, and switching to a dark French roast later yielded an even richer experience. I've tweaked the brewing duration a few times (ranging between 22 to 48 hours), and each time, the results didn’t miss the mark. It’s worth mentioning that swirling the brew intermittently seemed to allow better flavor distribution.  

**Positives**  
The strengths of this cold brew coffee maker make it a must-have kitchen accessory.  

- Reusable fine-mesh filter eliminates the mess from coffee grounds.  
- Compact size fits neatly into refrigerator doors.  
- Leak-proof seal is reliable for spill-free storage.  
- Dishwasher-safe components simplify maintenance.  

**Downsides**  
Despite its merits, there are a few aspects worth addressing.  

- Handle padding might degrade with heavy or prolonged use.  
- Brew container requires horizontal storage, consuming extra fridge space.  

**Product Competitors**  
When considering alternatives, a product like the Toddy Cold Brew System comes to mind. Toddy offers a versatile brewing solution but lacks the Tritan plastic durability and compact fridge-friendly design found in Takeya's coffee maker. Furthermore, the Toddy system involves more manual input and maintenance than Takeya’s easy setup. Alternatively, the Hario Mizudashi earns points for aesthetics but can't rival the airtight lid or spill-proof function offered here. Takeya strikes a balance between performance, ease, and portability, which many competitors struggle to achieve.  

**Value Proposition**  
Opting for Takeya's cold brew maker instead of café-bought coffee is a no-brainer in terms of cost-efficiency. Daily café runs could easily drain the wallet, whereas this home system lets me experiment with flavors and brew strengths without any additional costs. Factor this in with the durability of its material, reusable features, and overall user-friendly operation, and the value for the price becomes clear. Would I buy it again? Absolutely, for the savings and convenience alone it's a win.

ACT I
EXT. SMALL TOWN - SNOWY DAY - ESTABLISHING

The charming town of Evergreen Falls glows with holiday warmth. Children build snowmen. Lights twinkle on every roof.

INT. CAFE - MORNING

DANNY GONZALEZ, 30, hilarious and warm-hearted with a dash of internet chaos, edits a video in a quiet corner. A cocoa cup beside him has “Greg” written in whipped cream.

DANNY (V.O.)
I never planned to save a town. Or fall in love. I was just here for Wi-Fi and peppermint cookies.

Just then, LAURA SNOW, 28, sweet and clever with a holiday-crazy energy, bumps into him, clipboard in hand.

LAURA
Oh! Sorry—I was measuring the stage for the Christmas pageant. You're… Danny Gonzalez?

DANNY
That depends… are you Greg?

LAURA (chuckling)
I don’t think so?

DANNY (deadpan)
Interesting. That’s exactly what someone who isn't Greg would say.

ACT II
INT. TOWN HALL - DAY

Mayor Jinglestone ropes Danny into helping save the Festival of Festivities from cancellation. Danny agrees—but adds one condition: everyone must become Greg.

MAYOR JINGLESTONE
You’re the only influencer I know who owns a fog machine. Help us, Danny.

DANNY
Only if we do it the Greg way.

MONTAGE:

Danny leads “Intro to Greg” workshops.
He passes out “Hi, I'm Greg” name tags.
Laura teaches carolers the “Greg Carol” with suspiciously catchy lyrics.
Laura starts to wonder: Is “Greg” just a bit… or something more?

ACT III
INT. LAURA’S CABIN - NIGHT

Laura finds an old flash drive labeled TOP SECRET - GREG. Inside is a 2017 video of a young Danny declaring:

YOUNG DANNY (on screen)
If this video gets 1 million likes, I’ll make everyone Greg. On Christmas Eve. When the moon is full... it begins.

LAURA (softly)
This isn’t just a holiday bit. It’s a destiny.

INT. FESTIVAL STAGE - CHRISTMAS EVE

Danny raises a glowing Etsy-grade “Greg Crystal” as the full moon rises. Townspeople chant joyfully. “Greg” banners flap in the snowy wind.

Laura bursts onto the stage.

LAURA
Danny! You don’t have to make us Greg!

DANNY
But if everyone was Greg… there’d be no hate. Only... weird, fun internet unity.

LAURA
But maybe being Greg is about kindness. Acceptance. Not glowing eyes and matching hoodies.

Danny pauses. The Greg Crystal dims.

DANNY
So… Greg was never a person.

LAURA
Greg was a feeling.

They kiss. The snow sparkles. The crowd cheers. The banner unfurls: “EVERYONE IS GREG (IN SPIRIT)”

EPILOGUE
INT. GREG CAFE - ONE YEAR LATER

Danny and Laura now co-own a podcast and coffee shop called The Greg Spot. Locals wear Greg pins with pride.

A child walks up.

KID
Are you Danny Gonzalez?

DANNY
That depends… are you Greg?

KID (grinning)
Yup!

DANNY (smiling)
Welcome to the family.

They started setting up the tents on the second day, Brand new, pristine, twice the side of our medical tent.

It didnt look like hope, rather like Theater.

The rest of the second day wenr fine. But on the third day. I noticed they rearraged the food station crates to angke towards the camera. Logo first. A mother and child politely nudged out because their clothes were too dusty.

I pulled the Director aside. ""No staging"" i said ""Film what's real or dont at all""

They apologized, nodded. Adjusted. But not much.

By the fourth day they halted distribution twice, once to re-light a corner of the camp and another time because ""The backround faces werent expressive enough""

""They're turning this into a set"" He said
""People are waiting for food and they're asking them to smile""

""I know"" i hated it, but i didnt stop it.

That night Elias sat with me in the Administrator tent, he poured two cups of instant coffee and went quiet for a bit.

""Have you made peace with it?"" He finally asked

""No,"" i said

I nodded

""Why?""

""Because this gets us more trucks, more suplies, more medicine. I can live with that even if it means throwing away a little pride. In the end, Pride doesnt feed anybody""

He didnt reply, just sipped his coffee before moving on to his second cup.

As a former independent, hard working woman I’ve always been the type to not need assistance from anyone. Even at work, I’m a top former, have won several badges & awards & even a trip to corporate. Never have had to depend on no man, my parents or anyone!

Until now.. I’m the eldest child of 6 so maybe that can tell you a little more about how vulnerable I’ve felt these last 7 months being pregnant.. house work is now done by my husband, he’s truly been my rock.

But today, it’s felt like I’ve hit rock bottom and my lowest.

Work has been hard in itself with the brain fog, heightened emotions etc .. I WFH & this morning all was good, I was working, doing what I had to. I stepped away from my desk to get coffee, get some breakfast & take a little bathroom break. When I came back my computer was on sleep mode & of course had to log back in .. the problem is, is that I can’t remember my password! I tried multiple passwords & for the life of me could not remember my password at all. I ended up locking myself out of computer & had to call my works help desk for assistance.

To say how frustrating it was to speak to my help desk department is an understatement. Don’t get me wrong they are super nice but the whole department is ran by foreign employees & I could not understand anything they were asking me & they did not understand anything I was saying to them.

We went on for 20 min going in circles. Not sure how many times I needed to tell him “I need a password reset”. What got me was when he said to me “it’s the same password you used this morning” ……

April's over, and the talks between me and my parents haven't gone exactly how I envisioned, but nevertheless, it concluded with me having to stay and finish my mission anyway. I'm gonna at least ask for me to be moved to a mission closer to our country's MTC so I can work there instead.

It's especially heartbreaking because even though I feel as if I'm doing a disservice to myself and others by indirectly helping this godforsaken church, I can't do anything about it, not right now at least. I'm broke, I have no means to get to college nor look for a job, and my parents are the same because even though they're piss poor, they continue to pay their tithing like they'd be condemned to hell if they miss one payment to the company's subscription service.

The talks me and my parents have had was very insightful of their current view on the church. I explained everything calmly and straightforwardly. Never once raised my voice towards them. I explicitly said, ""Mom, Dad; I don't believe in the church anymore. I don't believe in the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith, the prophets' words, everything they've taught me. I've seen evidence that heavily outweighs the claims of the church being real. I've seen church historians, return missionaries, and even church leaders revoke their membership because they found the truth.""

And all I got for building up my courage was a massive shout fiesta. Especially from Dad. He told me that all those people are wrong, that ""the church is the one true thing holding this family together"", that without the church we won't be saved, that if I leave now the consequences will be catastrophic; everything. And it hurt because they didn't even try to listen. All they did was basically tell me, ""You are wrong. You're dumb for even doubting this church. You're going straight to hell, and you'll condemn us with you if you go through with this."" I couldn't even retaliate because I knew damn well that they're grasping on to straws. They're at their wits' end trying to make ends meet, and are desperately holding on to the one thing they see as a positive.

Sadly, after a few more days, I had no other choice but to give in. Without any real money or plan, I was directionless. 

In all honesty, I'm just going through with it because I know I can at least get some money from it. Get some allowance from the church and save it up so I can use it after my mission. I plan on moving out as soon as I get the means to do so, and cutting ties with this church a little while after. It's done nothing but bring me misery and sadness. It's turned my parents into mindless, brainwashed people who turn a switch the moment something or someone criticizes this company.

It's awful to see and hear them criticize and verbally abuse me just for expressing my wish to be away from the church. It's awful that the church teaches you that ""family is forever"", but only if you keep being a member of their subscription service. It's awful that the church preys on those with ""weak hearts and contrite spirits"", AKA people who are mentally and emotionally vulnerable all to turn a profit. It's awful that the church holds honesty and righteousness in such high regard, but when it comes to appoint a leader, they mess up and it often leads to child abuse.

I've always had this thought in my head, that it's awful how such a massive company can disguise itself as a holy dwelling, a safe space, when in reality it's nothing less than a gathering of brainwashed individuals, tricked into joining and protecting such a predatory pseudo-doomsday cult, and forced to ""ponder"" about the supposed ""eternal consequences"" of their actions if they dare to even take a sip of coffee/tea, or if they don't wear their magical underwear.

1kd3ath,https://www.reddit.com/r/mindfulnesschallenges/comments/1kd3ath/8_powerful_steps/,8 Powerful Steps,"# to Positive Thinking

In an increasingly fast-paced and often challenging world, maintaining a positive mindset can feel daunting. However, cultivating positive thinking is not only beneficial for mental health but also essential for overall well-being and personal development. Here are eight powerful steps to help you foster a positive outlook in your life:

## 1. Don’t Believe Everything You Think

Our thoughts often reflect our perceptions and experiences, but they are not always accurate representations of reality. Cognitive distortions, like overgeneralizing and catastrophizing, can lead to negative self-talk and a skewed view of the world. To counteract this, practice questioning your thoughts. Challenge the validity of what you think, asking yourself if there's evidence to support those beliefs or if they are simply assumptions. By doing so, you free yourself from the limitations of negative thinking patterns.

## 2. Focus on What You Want, Not on What You Don’t Want

It’s easy to dwell on fears and anxieties, but this habit only magnifies negativity in our lives. Instead, shift your focus towards your goals and desires. Creating a clear vision of what you want helps to prime your brain for opportunities that align with those aspirations. Vision boards and positive affirmations can serve as powerful tools to reinforce this focus, guiding your thoughts toward what you truly wish to achieve.

## 3. Look for the Lesson in Your Problems

Life inevitably presents us with challenges. However, each problem carries a lesson that can foster personal growth. Instead of viewing obstacles as burdens, consciously seek the silver lining in each situation. Reflect on what you can learn, how you can adapt, and how the experience contributes to your resilience. This mindset not only fosters positivity but also enhances your problem-solving skills.

## 4. Embrace an Attitude of Gratitude

Practicing gratitude is a proven way to enhance positivity. Take time each day to reflect on what you're thankful for, whether it’s the people in your life, your health, or simple pleasures like a warm cup of coffee. Regularly acknowledging the positive aspects of your life can shift your mindset, making it easier to navigate challenges and fostering a general sense of happiness.

## 5. Let Go of the Need for Perfection

Perfectionism can be paralyzing. The relentless pursuit of flawlessness often leads to disappointment and stress. Accept that mistakes and imperfections are part of the human experience. Embracing a growth mindset, in which you see imperfection as an opportunity for growth rather than a failure, will liberate you from the anxiety associated with achieving unrealistic standards.

## 6. Know That Everything in Life Happens For You, Not To You

Reframing your perspective on life events can have a profound impact on your mindset. Instead of viewing challenges as obstacles forced upon you, consider them both as opportunities for growth and as essential components of your journey. Believing that life is unfolding in your favor empowers you to embrace change and develop resilience, ultimately fostering a more positive outlook.

## 7. Let Go of All Resistance

Resistance often comes from a desire to control uncertainty. This struggle creates tension and stress, affecting our ability to think positively. Practice mindfulness to cultivate acceptance of the present moment. Acknowledge your feelings without judgment and allow experiences to flow without putting up barriers. This surrender to the current flow of life opens the door to insights and experiences that contribute positively to your journey.

## 8. Be Present in Everything You Do

Mindfulness is a powerful tool for fostering positivity. When you immerse yourself in the present moment, you reduce anxiety about the future and eliminate the weight of past regrets. Engage fully in whatever task you're performing, enjoying each moment as it comes. This practice enhances your appreciation for life’s simple joys, making it easier to maintain a positive outlook.

---

In conclusion, adopting a positive mindset is a journey rather than a destination. By implementing these eight powerful steps, you'll cultivate resilience, enhance your mental well-being, and unlock the potential within you. Remember, positive thinking is not about ignoring reality; it’s about empowering yourself to respond to life with hope, creativity, and strength. Embrace these steps, and get ready to transform your perspective and your life.

I brushed my teeth and walked into the kitchen, where my mom was already waiting—seated, sipping coffee, and watching one of her crazy news shows.

As soon as she saw me, she stood up and gave me a tight hug. “Happy birthday, honey.”

Then she went back to eating her toast and asking what I thought about some ridiculous conspiracy theory.

I didn’t reply. Just rolled my eyes while pouring myself a mug of coffee.

That’s when the doorbell rang.

I thought it was the party decorations I'd ordered and headed toward the door.

Strangely, the delivery person was already gone, even though I had taken no more than ten seconds to reach the handle.

On the porch, lying on the doormat, was a letter envelope—paper, but clearly containing something inside.

Curious, I picked it up and opened it.

Inside was a small scrap of paper, like a torn-off page, and a slender black object I couldn’t immediately identify.

I pulled out the note first. In messy handwriting, it read:

*Big day today baby.*

A chill shot down my spine as I read those words. It sounded a lot like him.

“Could this be father?” was all I could think, and for a few seconds, I stood there, frozen.

“No, it can’t be!” I said aloud, snapping out of it.

Then I turned my attention to the object. It didn’t look like anything familiar.

I gently pulled it out, feeling its softness and inspecting it carefully. But I soon dropped it—and screamed when I realized what it was.

A finger. It looked like a pinky. 

Blackened with rot, nail missing, the smell unbearable.

\*\*\*

“Do you want to cancel it?” my mother asked, as the police officers left our house. “The party, you know”

“No, I don’t,” I replied, slightly annoyed by the question.

This was supposed to be the first normal birthday I’d had since we escaped his grasp. I’d invited all my coworkers.

“The cops said they’d keep an eye out for him. They even gave me their personal numbers,” I reassured her, though it didn’t seem to help.

She sat at the table with her hands covering her mouth, anxious. It reminded me of those nights she used to wait for him to come home after hours at the bar—just to find out what kind of punishment he’d decide to unleash.

“Besides,” I added, “we don’t even know for sure if it’s him.”

“It’s him, honey,” she said firmly, eyes drifting off as if lost in a flashback. “We may not know whose finger that was, but you know damn well why it’s a finger.”

I saw tears start to form in her eyes and walked over.

“Even if it is him,” I said, placing my hands gently on her shoulders, “the police will catch him.”

I don’t know if she believed me or not, but she stood up and quietly went to her room.

It was almost noon now, and I decided to start setting up our living room for my birthday party later that evening.

I did everything while trying to push the incident out of my mind—but a voice kept echoing in my head:

*“Will we ever be free from him?”*

\*\*\*

The rest of the afternoon went by smoothly.

Snacks and drinks were on point. The tacky decorations I had ordered from Amazon finally arrived.

I took a long, hot shower and got dressed to welcome the first guests. My mother had also come out of her room, wearing a long white dress I hadn’t seen her in for years.

The last time she wore something like that, it hadn’t ended well with dad.

My two closest friends were among the first to arrive, and I couldn’t resist pulling them aside to explain what was going on.

“Oh my god, Maria,” one of them gasped, shaken. “Do you think he’s watching you or something?”

“I don’t know,” I replied. “But I’ve been texting the officer all afternoon. They’re patrolling the neighborhood. They’ve been looking for him for a long time now.”

“But why a finger?” the other asked, intrigued.

I didn’t answer. I just turned and looked over at my mother, who was seated, chatting with a friend.

My friends followed my gaze—and understood immediately. My mother was holding her beer glass with her right hand, and it was missing a finger—her pinky.

“The first time she tried to leave him, she packed everything in a suitcase while he was at work and we drove away,” I began, trying not to let the wave of emotion take over. “He found us at some crappy roadside motel and cut her finger off as punishment.”

My friends, probably not prepared for the intensity of what they’d just heard, went silent—eyes wide in disbelief.

“Jonathan should be here with the cake any minute,” I said suddenly, shifting tone, taking a sip of wine, trying to steer the mood back toward normalcy.

I tried to lighten the atmosphere, chatting with the other guests, refilling drinks, playing upbeat music. I told myself this was my day, and I wouldn’t let him take it from me again.

Then the doorbell rang.

My heart lifted a little. It had to be Jonathan with the cake. 

But when I opened the door, it wasn’t him.

It was just another guest, a coworker.

“How are you doing, birthday girl?” she said casually, stepping in with a bottle of wine in hand and giving me a kiss on the cheek. 

“By the way, I found this lying on the ground in front of your door,” she said, while handing me a plain envelope. “Thought it might be important.”

My hands were steady, but inside, everything went cold. I took the envelope, nodding as if it were nothing. It was similar to the last one. 

It was another ripped piece of paper, the same messy handwriting. Thankfully, no finger this time. The message read:

*Your present is coming baby*

\*\*\*

I forced a smile for the guests, trying not to alarm anyone. “Excuse me for a moment,” I said softly and slipped away to my room.

Once inside, I closed the door and grabbed my phone. My hands were shaking as I texted the police officer, asking if someone could check my house now—just to be sure.

Then I called Jonathan. He didn’t pick up.

I called again. Still nothing.

Panic began to creep in. He was meant to pick up my birthday cake, and I hadn’t heard a word from him all day. Something felt off.

A soft knock on the door made me flinch. It was my mom.

“You alright?” she asked gently, stepping inside.

I nodded, though my trembling hands said otherwise. Without speaking, I handed her the envelope.

She read the note inside and went quiet. Her gaze drifted into the distance, her expression hollow. 

“He’ll only stop when I’m dead,” she murmured, before breaking down in tears.

I rushed to her and held her tight as she wept in my arms.

We were interrupted, though, by a voice calling out from the door:

“Hey, Maria! The cake is here!”

I jolted upright. Jonathan must be here.  “Let’s go, mom,” I hurried out, heart pounding, only to find the guests looking at each other, confused.

“We heard the doorbell,” one of my friends said. “And we opened it, but there was just this box sitting on the doormat. I guess someone just left it here.”

At the front door, a cake box was lying there on the floor—white, sealed, with the bakery’s logo printed on top. 

I grabbed it and set it on the kitchen counter—only to feel something wet on my fingers.

A drop. Thick and dark red. 

The silence took over the room. I could feel every gaze on me as I carefully untied the bow and opened the box.

I felt sick to my stomach wondering what was inside, but I forced myself to lift the lid.

And, as you can imagine, there wasn’t a cake.

There was a face. A head.

Freshly severed—the color still vivid. Eyes closed, mouth slightly open.

It was a head I recognized instantly. The one that had haunted our daily lives with fear for so long. My father’s.

And stapled to his forehead, the same kind of torn paper as before, with the same crooked handwriting. It read:

Background of Wife: SAHM, who runs a small vinyl / wrapping business out of our basement. maybe 10k a year, Also subs, but ""not her passion"" she can make 20-25k here. 

Bought a much bigger house than we should have last year, Paid near 500k for it with 100k down, and a few months before that, bought her a white Tahoe so she could fit in with the other moms at pickup and drop off. Its whatever, i wont lie, i enjoy it too. These 2 things aside, we have no other debt. However, were strapped. Sports are in full swing, so Monday-Thursday, and Sat/Sun are usually full from 6pm-8pmish. I get home at 330pm with no OT and 530ish on OT days

This past week, I've been working some OT since its available (12 hour days, time x 1.5, so about 100$ an hour) Both our kids are in select sports, baseball and swim/gymnastics. This weekend was made available which is huge since its been pretty dry this last year. i can make approx 2k for 2 days work. However, my son has a baseball tourney on Sat/Sun and daughter has a swim meet on Sat. When i had originally told her of the OT she was very supportive and told me, yes work and we can figure it out. Well work plans change and Saturday and Sunday become one of the other.  Haven't made up my mind yet. 

This past week after 12 hours of work and 1 hour commute both ways, i've been getting home and speeding to make dinner. My wife doesn't cook, outside of crockpot meals. An argument we've had multiple times, cause we agreed that with the new house and sports, she was going to have to help. 365 days, maybe 5 dinners is what was done. Again, its whatever. Ill be honest, she couldn't cook herself out of a wet paper bag, but help is always appreciated. 

Fast forward to last night. Got home from OT late, Son is at baseball with Mom, Crockpot spaghetti is on the counter (shocked at this), and daughter has gymnastics in about an hour. Get home, see the dog has thrown up in multiple spots, so i get the carpet cleaner out and do them. I also notice that the new blade guard for the mower come in, so i hook that up, and mow the side of my house since it was super tall. Daughter finds me, shes been outside playing with her friends, and i tell her we need to get going. She comments how she wants to stay home and play instead of going to gymnastics. Sure, go ahead. Friends over stuff like that all day. 

Wife texted me asking if we had made it to gymnastics, i replied that she opted not to go. Crickets after that. Whatever, i finish up the yard, do the carpet cleaner cleanup, pick up here and there, and head downstairs to game for approx 30 minutes before they get home from baseball. She wont speak to me, drops her stuff at the door and walks out only telling me, that shes about to blow a gasket and needs to take a walk. She then doesn't come back inside until almost 11pm. Nothing from her yet this morning either. So shes big mad.

Out on the patio before i went to bed, i tried to get her to open up. She did. Unloaded. 

Shes exhausted, Feels under appreciated, is tired of driving the kids all over the state for sports, i didn't thank her for making dinner, i made a sex joke (insinuating that we should find some time), she was angry that i was going to work the weekend with both kids having events, i don't gymnastics serious by letting my daughter skip, and she wonders when someone is going to worry about her. 

Fucking lost. On my end, i make dinner almost every night, i do all the outside work, i do all the honey-do's, i don't even push for sex as much anymore because i know what the answer is every time. She has coffee days with her girlfriends every week, and spends time at our neighbors house (good friend). I dont ask for anything, i don't demand that the house be clean, the laundry be done, (its been sitting in baskets in the master for a week), i just ask that the kids be alive, and that the kitchen be somewhat straight so when i make dinner i don't have the clean the kitchen before hand. 

i dont know guys. lost on this one.

It’s funny how something as modest as dust covers can save you a lot of cleaning agony. Given their versatility and convenience, these covers truly caught my attention, though, as with most products, there’re a few quirks to delve into.

**Design and Material Quality**

The transparent, polyethylene (PE) material used for these covers is deceptively simple yet surprisingly effective. The clarity is honestly one of the best parts; no more guessing games about what appliance I’m covering. My coffee maker, air fryer, and even my slow cooker all seemed perfectly comfortable under these elasticized dust covers. At first, I thought they might feel flimsy, but the thickened design eliminated that worry. They’re also waterproof, which saved my blender from a rogue spill of orange juice—just wiped it down, and bam, clean as new!

**Ease of Use**

I can’t tell you how satisfying it is to use these elasticized covers. Whether covering a chunky pressure cooker or a sleek toaster oven, the snug fit is what makes these so practical. It’s sort of like dressing your appliances in stretchy, protective armor. Just pull it on, and whoosh—done in seconds. Even my teenagers got into the habit of covering appliances after whipping up their usual mix of chaos in the kitchen. The ease of use is definitely a highlight here.

**Versatility**

This set isn’t just about protecting one or two items. With 40 covers in various sizes, I’ve found uses beyond the kitchen. Aside from appliances, they’ve been a lifesaver for shielding electronics and smaller furniture items from temporary construction dust during a light remodel. The multiple sizes make them adaptable; I’d even venture to say they’re better than some of the pricier individually sold alternatives.

[Check AZLGSH dust-cover-01 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0cppxbkrh/)

**Advantages**

- Transparent material makes identifying appliances easy.  
- Convenient disposable design ensures one-time use without hassle.  
- Elastic fit accommodates appliances of various shapes and sizes.  

**Limitations**

- Single-use nature might not appeal to eco-conscious users.  
- Covers may slightly rip when stretched over unusually large appliances.  

**Other Options**

Comparing these with reusable appliance covers, I’d say the disposable nature gives them a distinct edge for those who value convenience. Brands like Homest offer reusable, padded covers that cater to people looking for long-term protection. While the latter is thicker and might provide robust coverage, it lacks the flexibility and ease of these disposable ones. The clear material here enables visibility, unlike the opaque covers offered by competitors, which led to me accidentally attempting to brew coffee without removing an opaque cover once (long story!).

**Bang for the Buck**

I imagine the appeal of their price lies in the large quantity bundled into one pack. Though I’m avoiding exact numbers, I will note that it feels like a lot of utility for the price point when measured against others in its category. Buying them in bulk makes more sense than needing to stock up on individual dust covers regularly. The affordability paired with functionality definitely tilts this in favor of budget-conscious households.

In the hustle and bustle of everyday life, we often forget about the little joys that can make our day better. Here are a few examples that helped me change my perspective:

2. Walks in Familiar Places: Instead of rushing, I began to stroll around my neighborhood, paying attention to details: flowers, architecture, and people. This opened my eyes to the beauty that has always been around me.

3. Gratitude Journal: Every evening, I write down three things I am grateful for. This helps me focus on the positive moments and notice the beauty in the little things.

4. Creativity: I started drawing and taking photos. It’s not only a way of self-expression but also an opportunity to see the world from a new perspective.

He’s stopping showing any affection (hugs, hasn’t kissed me since sometime last fall, hasn’t said he loves me in over a month or longer). He’s so easily agitated towards the kids and I and will pick fights with me over absolutely nothing. He’s always on his phone when he is home. 

So… this brings me to last night. We’re in bed and asleep. I feel him get out of bed and leave our bedroom. No big deal but I hear him coming up the stairs and he comes in our room and lays his phone on the nightstand (this is around 11pm). I go back to sleep and I’m woke up maybe an hour or so later bc he’s on his phone again and the screen brightness is turned up so it’s really bright. He notices I’m awake and turns his phone off and rolls over. I go back to sleep and I’m woken up a little while later by his phone ringing. I ask him who’s calling this late at night and he says he doesn’t know who it is but the same number called earlier. I asked if he answered earlier and he asked when. I said when he want downstairs was it because he answered and he said oh no he was getting a glass of water (before bed he asked me to bring him a bottle of water when I came upstairs so his water in the middle of the night didn’t make sense). 

He cheated before about 9.5-10 years ago and it lasted 10 months before I found out. I’ve noticed over the last few months he’s on his phone whenever I wake up during the middle of the night. Until the phone calls last night I didn’t think he was cheating but now I’m really torn. Before I figured out how early he was getting to work I would have never thought he was cheating because of lack of opportunity but knowing he’s getting to work that much earlier “to finish his coffee” in the parking lot before going in just makes it more suspicious. Why do you need to get to work at 4am when you don’t start until 6:15am? His paycheck hasn’t changed so he isn’t getting overtime. Why sit in the parking lot for 2 hours? Why be on the phone all hours of the night? Do people just doom scroll Facebook at midnight when their alarm goes off at 3:15am? 

I’m not really asking for advice but maybe just someone to say “you aren’t crazy for thinking he’s cheating.” ",8,1746197682.0,DeadBedrooms,12,0.83,False

A villain, a trickster, a chicken thief, a god killer, and, naturally, a man-eating ghoul. She’s had her fill of talentless bards warbling embellished nonsense and spurned lovers twisting the truth to soothe their wounded pride. If history insists on painting her as a monster, she might as well be the one holding the brush. With ink-stained fingers and a toothless grin, she sets out to write her story. A tale of drunken excess, fallen companions, reckless escapades, and a legion of enemies who still spit her name like a curse. 

Yet buried within the wreckage of many misdeeds lies a fluff of sunshine - a stubborn little girl, too foolish or too headstrong to fear her, who, against all reason, nudges Lyra toward something she never expected: a moment of heroism and a thought that maybe just maybe there's more to life than getting on the nerves on everyone she meets. One that hurls her into a sea of politics, tangled with murderous knights of lotus who want to kill all things non-human, cunning queen conspiring to overthrow her lazy husband with seven dwarves, comely princesses with werewolf fetish, lusty eunuchs scheming for self interests, and ancient gods conspiring to start a holy war with the help of a hedonistic nun.

Chapter - 1 Do Vampires Dread Mosquito Bites?

All great stories have great beginnings; they often start with a meeting in a tavern or the arrival of a mysterious stranger in a town laden with outlaws. Mine, however, began six feet under, thanks to an attractive vampire with hair that blazed like a hearthfire.

If this were a conventional biography, I would have begun with the incident where I devoured a ghoul’s heart, Devil bless his generous soul, and became immortal. But I choose not to. Who cares if a young lady became a trifle too famished to concern herself with social propriety? She has every right to, and people know it. All they need is a good story, and I intend to give them one.

I’ll begin with the event that defined my career where I rose from the dead, or so those unaware of my peculiar talents would say. Buy them a drink, and they’ll say I crushed a man’s head with my bare hands. Toss them a coin, and they’ll swear I led dragons to slay a nun. Offer them a warm bed and a bucket to piss in, and they’ll claim I rode a winged horse to kill a rakish prince. All these legends. All these songs. They’re true.

But they are just songs and legends that present the truth in a different light. Which is why I ask you, would you rather listen to those charlatans who twist my story for their own gain? Or would you rather hear it from me, a woman kissed on the arse by sweet Lady Misfortune? If your answer is the latter, then put on a glove and take my red right hand, for we’re about to hail a boat and set sail down this indomitable, never-ending river called Time. But if your answer is the former, I ask you why not? I killed old empire fanatics and hacked their god to bits, surely that counts for something. Now, hurry up, you reluctant sod, take my hand and heed my ignoble tale.

\*\*\*\*\*

Around fifty years ago, on a night when ponds shimmered with the soft hue of milky pearls and owls flirted with wide, lustful eyes, I found myself astride a rude black stallion, its hooves clattering on the cobbled path in the middle of a forest. The sound was loud enough to be a wake-up call to a Wendigo, ever in search of its greatest rival, yours truly, the greatest of all man-eaters.

My long, matted hair, caked with blood, danced in the cool night air, mirroring the rustle of the trees lining the road ahead. Among those trees, pointy-eared cunts lay in wait, their eyes tracking me. The first arrow came with the soft, buzzing hum of a honeybee as it sliced through the air. As I listened to the sound, the hairs on my body prickled like a frightened rooster’s. My hand, driven by instinct, shot out and caught the shaft inches from my face.

Some pointy-eared bastard let another arrow fly. Slicing through the mist, it struck my horse with a sickening thud, embedding itself deep in its skull. I was thrown off balance, crashing to the ground, my face landing in goat shit. The impact knocked the wind out of me, leaving me sprawled and gasping.

After what felt like an eternity, I slowly began to rise from that indignity, but a heavy boot slammed down on my back, pinning me hard against the cobblestones and forcing me to taste goat shit once again.

""The mighty ghoul under my boots,"" said a gravelly voice. ""I feel so honored.""

He lifted his boot off my body and whistled like a koel. Two men emerged from the bushes and hauled me to my feet, not for the cunt who had put his filthy boot on my back, but for the striking woman who made men think, Oh, seven blessings, she could do unspeakable things to me.

She walked toward me, silent as a snake in the grass, her visage… ahem… pardon me for the dreadful simile, like a petal with eyes of stone floating on a river of piranhas.

She approached, a cigar in her mouth, its smoke curling in foggy drifts. She was the kind of woman who could make a man jump into a pit of vipers by convincing him the alternative was far worse.

""You killed my brother?"" the elf asked, cold and direct. 

Ah, she was such a delight. People with that no-nonsense approach practically begged to have their feathers ruffled, and it is the birthright of every trickster to rile up such peculiar creatures. I held back and simply nodded in response. But still, common sense wasn’t my strongest suit, and so I couldn’t resist asking the triggering question.

""I killed a lot of brothers. Which one do you speak of?""

""The one whose cock you cut off and shoved into his mouth,"" she answered, her collected facade breaking with that twitch in her lips.

""Oh, you mean Lordling Cockless? That goat-fu,"" she struck me across the face, and I saw stars.

""Drag this whore to farewell grounds,"" she said, her gaze peeling away as if I were less than a worm. How hateful. But given what I did, I can't blame her.

""Sounds like a lovely place,"" I said.

They dragged me through the forest, tying me to one of their scrawny horses. Poor bastards, those elves, they were once so glorious, riding shiny steeds! How the mighty have fallen! Centuries ago, they saw humanity as little more than dirt beneath their feet. Now look at those proud pointies, living in shitholes. Ah, those poor fuckers, so sad, so tragic, so melancholic and all those synonyms.

My pity only lasted until the horse jolted forward, dragging my body across the unforgiving earth. Twigs and jagged stones tore at my skin, ripping through flesh that reattached as quickly as it was shredded. I tasted blood, dirt, and things both familiar and foreign. I struck a root or two, my body jerking upward, bones snapping and rejoining in a brutal, nauseating rhythm.

Finally, when the moon reached its peak and ghosts roamed the earth to appear only to drunks, they stopped near a graveyard on a cliff overlooking their fragile settlement. The settlement, cobbled together from scraps of wood, metal, and cloth, flickered with sporadic lights, like dying fireflies, fairies imprisoned in lamps. These fairies dimmed now, their glow fading with the slow poisoning of their sacred tree, the source of all that powered elvish life.

Oh, those poor fairies, how dreadful it must be to be so charmingly queer and yet imprisoned in wretched lamps! How I yearned to free them whenever I saw them. Where does that desire come from? I often wondered, and the answer always lay in the memories I lost after devouring the ghoul heart. Sometimes, those memories return, and helplessness stirs my temper. But I quell it quickly with a single thought, Lady Fate is one horny bitch,

They untied me from the horse, and bound my hands as I knelt. ""Lady Fate is one horny bitch,"" I muttered, more to unsettle the elves than to temper my anger.

A swift kick to my face drove me into the wet grass, the taste of iron spreading across my tongue.

""Quiet,"" snapped the same elf who’d shoved me down, his boot still reeking of filth.

""W-what’s your name?"" I asked, spitting blood. ""You’ve got a remarkable kick. Seems only fair to know the name.""

""Kalantus, my lady. The name’s Kalantus,"" he said, giving a mock bow.

""Kalantus!"" I exclaimed, giggling like a lovestruck girl. ""Such a masculine name for such an unmasculine man. Hitting a woman like that, are you sure you’re not compensating for something?""

""Careful,"" he growled. ""We wouldn’t want that pretty face of yours ruined by common filth like me.""

""I am an immortal, you dumb fuck.” I said, and Kalanthus unsheathed his blade, pressing it to my cheek.

""You asked for it,"" he said, grinning with such evilness even  I would find comical.

""Enough!"" barked the she-elf. ""This one’s mine, Kalantus, mine!""

""Yes, Lady Lilia,"" he replied, backing immediately.  

""Ghoul blood would taste foul on your tongue, vampire,"" I said.

The red-haired elf unsheathed her cinquedea. She held it in her hand as though it had sprouted from her palm. What an honor, indeed, to meet one’s end at the hands of such a ravishing creature, with red hair that complemented her unblemished fair skin, and blue eyes that shone like opals. She was perfect.

Unfortunately, I do not have the pleasure of dying normally, and the elf was well aware of the fact, she had planned accordingly. She did not prepare an elaborate ritual or embark on a long journey to a volcano carrying my corpse. Instead, she did it the old-fashioned way of torturing immortals, placing me in a casket and burying me six feet under.

As her merry band of elves dug, the she-elf spoke. ""You love the sound of your own voice, don’t you? Fine, let’s play a game. I’m going to ask you some questions, and you have to act like a buffoon so I can inflict pain that you crave so much.""

""Wonderful, ask away,"" I said.

""Who asked you to kill my brother?""

""The one who farts in roses an' speaks in po'try,"" I slurred, as if I were one bottle away from fucking an undesirable.

She growled and carved a line across my cheek. ""Name,"" she asked, her voice sharp like thorns. ""I demand a name.""

""He’s a very important person. Are you willing to take that risk?""

A quick flash of the knife parted my flesh in a symmetrical line, revealing the muscle beneath. As the skin healed, the blood stopped before it could mark my pale cheek entirely.

""You’d need to carve through a hundred men, hard sons of bitches who collect elvish scalps like prized trophies.""

""‘Black Company’ she spat, disgusted.

“Heard they were the ones who chopped your father’s head off and stuck a pig’s on instead. Creative pricks, aren’t they?” I said, cackling. I let my cackle drag longer than necessary to play her little game.

Then I saw her face. Fury twisting her fine features into a mask of a wounded lion. It’s a sin for such a fine facade to be marred by such dark emotions.

""I knew your brother was born from the corpse of your hanged mother. Is that right? Felt right to kill him that way,"" I said, giving her my special crooked smile, reserved for those who want to rend me asunder.

She pounced on me, slamming me to the ground and knocking the wind out of me. Then, with a primal scream, she slashed my face over and over. Each cut brought a brief flash of pain before it healed almost instantly. I laughed through the entire ordeal, unintentionally, more lunatic than usual. I just couldn’t control it.

“What the fuck is wrong with her?” whispered a she-elf whose facade and good name elude my memory.

The vampire elf, exhausted, collapsed beside me, panting, each breath escaping as a thin plume of mist.

""I... I killed him because I wanted to,"" I said, a smile trembling on my lips even as pain ripped through my body. ""The money’s... it’s good and all, but... but with a good conscience, I... I must speak with utmost veracity, if... if he’d been a good lay, I wouldn’t... wouldn’t have bothered killing him. Do you want to know his final wo-”

Sweet ol’ Kalanthus stomped me in the face, forcing my head back into the mud. He knelt down, scooped up a handful of horse shit, and smeared it across my face, slow and calm, like a virtuoso finishing his masterpiece.

I tried to spit it out, but it landed back on my face as a wet, dried splatter that clung to my skin. I wiped it away with the back of my hand, smearing it more than cleaning it.

“Delightful,” I muttered, the bitter taste still lingering on my tongue.

The red-haired elf rose to her feet and brushed the dust off her clothes with an air of dignity. The kind only the privileged possess, accompanied by that subtle annoyance at the dirt that dared to cling to them. It must have felt nostalgic for her to act so dignified in days when there was no dignity left for her kin. It makes sense, I suppose, as people say: elves feel more deeply than anyone else; everything they do is infused with passion. Profess your love to them through actions, and you may bask in the gratitude of multitudes. But slight them even slightly, and all of mankind cannot shelter you from their wrath.

""Kalanthus,"" she whispered, her voice cold and low, casting that invisible thread of authority that makes you quiver without your knowing.

Kalanthus stepped forward, his stride carrying all the meekness of a sheep about to be slaughtered.

""Yes?"" he croaked. A sudden punch to the throat and a roundhouse kick to the face sent him sprawling. The vampire elf strode over to him like a tiger approaching its dying prey and planted a foot on his chest.

""You've been an insolent little fuck for quite some time,"" she hissed, her voice low and venomous. She spat on his face—lucky bastard—and said, ""When I command you to speak, you speak. When I order you to move, you move. When I order you to shit, you shit!""

She knelt down, her red hair dancing in the wind like rage personified. “Do you understand?” she whispered, her voice cold and low.

""Y-yes,"" he croaked. ""I-it wasn’t... wasn’t m-my in... in-in-intention t-to question your judgment.""

""Good,"" she said, her face calm, having made her point. She stood up and turned to me with contempt in her eyes.

""Deal with her,"" she commanded, gesturing to her servants. Behind her, Kalantus muttered under his foul breath, ""Fuck you, bitch. I'll kill you myself."" My enhanced senses caught all of it. The way he said it sounded like a promise meant to be kept. It would have been good to know how that went for him. But alas, they buried me six feet under, and I never found out. Every day, as I lay buried, they poured spider acid—a substance I heal from slowly—into my casket through a pipe they had placed when burying me. In that casket, I suffocated in a torturous, ponderous rhythm, yearning for sweet release, and yet, contradictingly, I also felt the desire to survive, like all mankind. To be suffocated, yet without taking the hand of death as it extended its skeletal fingers, whispering like a shameless vixen, *“Touch me, touch me,”* felt unnatural. Wrong. Do you understand?

After two years of suffering, one day the usual prick did not come to pour acid. In his place came the wendigo. In tears, it tore open the casket, and I felt both bitter and thankful. Then, with its emaciated hands, it picked out each maggot, concern flickering in its hollow white eyes. You want to imagine it, I suppose, to haunt your dreams, perhaps? I can fulfill that desire. Imagine a starving wolf, but with antlers twisted like gnarled branches and sharp bones protruding from its emaciated chest. Disgusting? There is more. Think of its skin stretched tight over its face, long limbs, and hands, with hollow eyes of hunger and malice. It moves on hind legs, its patchy fur blacker than night, and claws sharp enough to tear through flesh and bone like the silk of a blushing groom.

It poured flesh and blood from a cask onto my lips, and my body began to heal. With the maggots out of my flesh, I stood up in all my naked glory, gazing upon the tall monstrosity.

“Did you a a red haired vampire elf?” I asked.

""I slay not mine kin, yet thou art an exception."" It said.

""Can you tell me if you killed an elf that was uncharacteristically ugly?"" I asked eagerly.

""Nay, but I have laid curses most foul: mothers to devour their daughters, sisters to consume their brothers, fathers to feast upon their sons, and neighbors to rend one another asunder.""

""You should have spared the children. What in the name of Lilet’s cock is wrong with you?"" I snapped, genuinely upset.

""I have healed thee, that thou might rise and face me in battle! Stand, thou bosom friend, and fight!""

""I am naked, you mutt! I have neither sword nor armor with which to fight you.""

I heard someone approaching from behind and turned around with the alertness of a feline. Standing there was a young elf, dark-skinned and handsome, if you could overlook the axe lodged in his skull and the unsettling red glow of his eyes. He tossed a curved, single-edged sword adorned with elvish runes at my feet and began to strip. It was an act I would have watched giggling, had he not been dead.

Yes, indeed, I'm a necrophagic creature with boundless lust, but I am not perverse; my lust is solely reserved for all things humanoid that are willing to have long romantic walks with a croissant in hand or a cheap bottle of vodka.

He bore scars that could make any maiden who dreamed of chivalrous heroes gasp, lassies like yours truly, of course. The sleeping beast beneath his torso. The magic wand that bewitched bitches like me was a sight to behold. As he walked, his wand swayed up and dowb.

As much as it pained me to do so, I looked beyond him and saw red pinpricks glowing in among the trees. Five elves, I guessed without counting, for five is the limit of a wendigo's tether.

I put on the tattered tunic trousers and boots, then picked up the weapon.

“Beautifully made.” I said, swinging about the sword with practiced ease.

""Six, including this naked one? Oh, how noble. I’m not the same graceful girl I once was."" I asked, turning to the wendigo.

""I am not unjust. I shall release them upon thee, and when thou hast recovered , I shall face thee in turn.""

""How generous. Tell me, fellow fiend, no matter what happens here, you wouldn’t lay a finger on me, correct?”I said approaching it.

""Deceit is unknown to me; 'tis the way of men alone. I do as I speak.""

""Hope you are right!"" I said, pirouetting on my feet. With a swift swing of my sword, I sliced through its long limbs. That poor trusty fucker caught off guard and crashed to the ground—his head striking the tombstone with a satisfying thud.

“I am no human, but I do share all their vices and none of their virtues, so you should have thought of me doing this mutt. Now, you promised to fight only when the time is right, so you better keep it! O noble creature who knows no deceit” I said, slashing the abdomen of the elf who had so generously stripped off their clothes for me.

The other five stepped out of the darkness, carrying with them weapons of opportune, scythe, swords, rakes, even pans!

The man with the pan pounced like a cat, and I swung my sword and cut his head clean off. His body skidded across the ground, his hand still clutching his sooty weapon.

I sensed movement behind me, but it was too quick to react. I still tried, turning, but not fast enough to avoid the blonde-haired she-elf whose rake punched into my side.

Pain flared, but I caught the weapon before it drove deeper and snapped it with my forearm. My senses warned me again. I ducked low, feeling the air whistle as a hammer passed. The she-elf wasn’t so lucky. The wild swing caught her in the head, which burst like an overripe tomato, showering the ground in brain pulp.I pivoted and opened the stomach of the brute, who collapsed like a rag doll. But before I enjoyed my victory, a kick to my head sent me crashing to the ground.

The one who kicked me wore armor made of mismatched parts and held a longsword in his hand. I tried to get up, but a child with a dagger leaped on top of me and stabbed me in the eye. The brat tried to pry the dagger out to stab me again. As I struggled to get him off, the armored elf bent low and slid his sword through my cheeks, the blade cutting into my mouth and emerging from the other side.

I pulled the broken rake from my side and drove it into the child's head, just as the brute withdrew his sword. Shoving the dead kid off me, I rolled away from brute's mighty swing that left a deep gash on grass and sprang to my feet.

“Your love for prolonged cruelty is my blessing,” I said to Wendigo, smiling as the wound sealed itself. I could imagine how unsettling it must be to naïve young bloods eager to slay the big, bad Lyra the Ghoul. Those brave soldier boys who had managed to land a similar cut had watched in horror as it mended before their eyes.

I always gave them a chance to prove themselves after the defeat by offering them two easy choices: balls or lives. Surprisingly, many chose their balls. It was a trick question, and those foolis lost their lives!

The armored brute advanced, swinging for my ribs. I moved out of reach and, quick as a cat catching a rat and closed the distance before he could comprehend. A flash of movement, and my blade sliced toward the underside of his wrist. His grip faltered, the longsword dipping in his grasp.

Seizing this opening, I struck again, driving my blade into the gap between his pauldron and breastplate. I wrenched it free, tearing his muscle in the process. He staggered back, and then his knees buckled as blood spilled down from his side. Just to be sure, I picked up a rake, removed his helmet and stabbed him in the face.

“That was beautiful and a much needed warm up for staying still for so long. How long was I out again?” I asked approaching the wendigo who started to heal its legs.

“Two summers,” the wendigo said.

“Two goddamn years? I suppose it’s too late to fulfill that spy’s dying wish to warn King Vasley of a possible snow elf invasion on Vransy.”

""Why dost thou offer aid to one thou claim’st no care for? Was it perchance empathy thou didst feel?""

""Empathy? Don’t be ridiculous!"" I said, more sharply than I expected. “I care for rewards and nothing more.”

""Carest thou naught for what doth befall? The purpose of mortals is lost to mine understanding, yet thou wert once of their kind, dost thou truly scorn all thought of a higher calling?""

""I don’t know about this empathy you speak of. Helping the kingdom earn me some coin to satisfy my desires for pleasure and wine!”

“Carest thou naught for mankind?“Desirest thou not to be as they art? Thou speakest as they do.””

“Yes, I do not care for the upheavals that so frequently occur in the cycles of mankind. Men resent me for my nature, and their insults may flow freely, but in the end, only I shall remain. So, why bother to be like them?”

""I hath beheld a vision, a dream of thee as a maiden fair. Each time I dost taste thy blood, memories of thy past life do unfold ere mine eyes. Dost thou desire to know what thou once wert? Wouldst thou learn of the love, the heartbreak, and the time when thou didst possess a soul?""

I drew my sword and leveled it at the cur’s head. “Hold your tongue, dog. I’ll not suffer your prattle any longer.”

""Wilt thou slay me? Nay, thou shalt not, my love, thou shalt not. I am all thou hast.""

I wanted to drive that sword in and end it then and there. Perhaps it would have been for the best. But history isn’t made by doing all the right things. Sometimes you must not listen to a rational mind that urges you to kill the mutt conspiring to ruin your pleasure-seeking. Instead, give it a kiss, go seek out your salad days, and end up meeting a charming little girl who would change your life forever.

**Chapter - 2  Can a riest whip the devil out of you?**

Whenever I commit morally repugnant acts that are vile enough to make even a man with balls of steel gag and faint, I seek penance like any God-fearing woman. When I visit church, I take extra care to hide my beauty from the lecherous eyes of priests, veiling myself from head to toe in the silk noblewomen cherish to keep their skin fair.

I would step into the booth and talk at length about all the things I had done. Almost always, the priests twisted my words and branded me a devil. 

The worst of them was a handsome priest who, in the throes of lovemaking, kept shouting, “Forgive me, Lord, I have sinned!” over and over, all the while overcompensating by doing far more than I had asked for. He, in fact, lasted quite a while for a man forbidden even the taste of a woman’s lips.

When it was over, we lay naked—gasping and sweating—my skin sticky with heat . I turned my head, with my dark hair plastered to my pale face and asked,

""Do you do this to all the women who come for confession, or did you just accidentally slip your dick in today?""

He ignored me and sat up, his eyes fixed on the dancing flames of the hearth. I asked if he’d care for another round. instead of shouting, “Yippie yippie hurrah hurrah!” for being so lucky, he burst into tears. 

I approached him with what may have been concern flickering in my eyes and gave a reassuring pat on his flaccid pecker. 

""It’s not the size that matters. It’s how you use it. And You, my my holy friend, fucked like a man of dedication, focus, and sheer fucking will."" I ejaculated.

He recoiled as if I were a leper and stammered, “You… you used the devil’s magic! You demon whore, stay away from me!”

""Aww, sweetie. You give me too much credit. It seems God has blessed you, priestie. You should cherish it.""

He stumbled out of bed, backing away like a cornered hare, taking frantic little steps, his balls bouncing with each one. He accidentally bumped into a table, and a butter knife clattered to the floor. He  lunged for it, clutched it in both of his trembling, pale hands that never seen the sun. 

""Fine, you whorish chameleon,"" I said, raising my hands in surrender. ""There’s no need for violence.”

“Stand back, you devil. You’ve ruined me.” He said, inching closer.

""Fine, fine, fine,"" I said, letting out a deep sigh. Then I poked my thumb at my chest. ""The devil will do your bidding. I’ll tell them that I besieged you with devilish charm! You’ll be forgiven, and I’ll take the blame.""

I noticed his pecker was as downcast as his eyes. He took a hesitant step forward, gripping the butter knife with trembling hands.

“It’s… it’s… it’s your own damn fault. You demon whore! If I let you leave, my life is over!” Those cruel, cruel words spilled from his bite-worthy, plump lips, striking me like an arrow loosed by a cherubic angel.

“You’re underestimating how understanding people can be,” I said, stepping closer. “I’ll go tell everyone how I dropped your pants with the sight of dangling breasts. The dirty old men nodding to themselves would say, ‘It’s natural for a young man to have a strong appetite.”

I looked up, folding my hands in mock contemplation. ""Or maybe I’ll compose a song about it, and the title will be 'Lyra and Priest’s Pizzle.'""

I shook my head. ""No, that’s a terrible title. How about Holy Sausage and Demon Harlot? That’s perfect! Now, how should the lyrics go?""

I grabbed my lute at the bed and strummed it once, letting the sound fall as gracefully as rock-hard goat shit.

 

Kneel for eel,

 forsake the Lord,

Moans and hymns in sinful rhyme,

Bless thy breasts with blasphemous lips.

 

At that point, he couldn’t take it anymore. My feminine brilliance had become a needle, pricking at his fragile ego. In a burst of jealous rage, he lunged at me, desperate to butcher the great Lyra Bard with a weapon that could strike fear into cheesecakes.

I responded to his daring attack by stepping aside, and he slipped on the spilled wine. It was entirely my fault, I knocked it over in excitement when he admitted he wanted to suck my toes.

He went down hard, his throat slamming against the sharp edge of the coffee table with a sickening crunch. A wet, choking sound escaped his lips as his body twitched, fingers grasping at something. My waist, perhaps, for a waltz or to perform one of those vaginal massages doctors recommend. His mouth hung open. Was it for a kiss? A jest? He went still before he could answer any of those questions.

At the time, watching his lifeless, naked body, the philosopher in me murmured,

""The soul is a fragile thing, caged by mortality like a flame cupped in hands."" Then I closed his eyes, my fingers moving like the soft graze of a silk curtain.

To honor his dying wish, I stabbed myself with the butter knife.

""You are dead, devil,"" I proclaimed, giggling like a boy who triumphed in mischief. ""You can harm me no more, seduce me no more.""

I imagined how it would’ve gone had I been a mortal woman. He would have finished the job by stabbing me twice or thrice, unleashing a sanguine tide. Then he would’ve collapsed beside me, gasping for breath like a fish out of water.

 Once his strength returned, he’d rise to his feet, crack his fingers, grab my corpse by the legs and drag me out. Then he would’ve shoveled a massive heap of earth to bury me six feet under.

Afterward, he would go about his life as if the entire ordeal had been a nightmare conjured by an emissary of the devil. Justifications such as—*she deserved it, she was asking for it, she didn’t know when to shut up, yada yada yada*—would pile upon one another, growing into a mountain built on a single deplorable memory, until it all became a lie painted by a stranger.

Anyhow, none of it happened, it would’ve done me no good to dwell on all my imaginings which were as bendy as a wick, easy to snuff out. And so once I hurt myself enough, I left his body to rot and made a vow: never fuck a priest again and always go for the nun.

I kept that promise and only met priests to gabble about what I had done and what I would do in future. I had one such talk with a priest right after I came out of my two-year imprisonment in the coffin.

“Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.” I began, my voice measured, reverent yet heavy. “It’s been too long since my last confession, almost two years. My last confession was to old Father Uberto, a man who thought little of me. He called me evil. Devil incarnate. So tell me, Father, am I irredeemable?”

“I have heard of you, Lyra. Men spoke of your deeds quite often in those taverns I frequent. I won’t be judging you like those people. The Lord has guided me to this calling to understand you and love people like you. People who need help.”

“Will you make love to me?”

The priest’s eyse widened a second and then he let out a loud, hearty laugh. “I have made love to enough women, girl. I am old and ugly now. If I were younger and godless, perhaps I might have considered it. But right now all I can do now is listen. Speak your mind, and I will listen.”

I told him everything I had done. The short version, not the long one detailing my exploits, like stealing the trinkets of Crows and ruining the lovemaking of Pigs, important events. And It took me less than a day, more than half a day, but slightly less than evening to tell all of it.

When I was done, he let out a yawn and asked, “You told me what you’ve done. Do you have any plans on what to do next?”

I was a bit taken aback, most would have called me irredeemable, but this one was willing to listen and learn about the splendiferous path I wished to tread

“I don’t know, Father. I always have a plan, but not today. I am hoping you’d suggest something. The more vile, the better.”

“Unfortunately, I cannot speak of nefarious ideas. I am a holy man now,” the priest said.

“Good treachery needs privacy,” I replied. “And the hand of God is always hovering over this sacred place. Nevertheless, I’m disappointed in you, priest. I never took a man of your station to be such a bore. You didn’t even bother to repeat the pious nonsense priests always spout. Something like, *‘Do not eat the flesh of man. If you truly repent, you should starve yourself to death, for your existence is cursed. Whip yourself whenever you lust after a married man.’*”

“Unfortunately, such a personality is not a costume I can wear. Some people aren't good at making masks. You are not so different. You cannot go against your nature, can you? How can a ghoul like you do anything but eat a man's flesh?” the priest asked.

“I tried vegetables once,” I said, sticking out my tongue with a grimace. “Made me sick. How do you people eat that?”

He ignored my question and offered one of his own. “Yet even so, you still managed to put on a mask. Why Lyra? Why do you refrain from loving yourself?”

“What? Love myself? What are you, some kind of homo?” I asked, genuinely stupefied by such outrageous questions.

“Why do you resist seeking pleasure with sincerity?” he asked again.

I cackled loud and long. “Th–Tha–That w-was f-funny! I h-haven’t—-hah—-heard a j-joke that g-good in—ohhhhh–a long time!” I wiped a tear from my eye, still laughing. “Pleasure—ah, it’s the one thing I crave most. And lucky me, I get my fill every day. Tell me, priest—does my spirit grow fat from all the pleasure I get?”

The priest did not speak, even after I respectfully ceased my laughter. Overcome by boredom, I began counting aloud. One, two… and on it went, until six hundred sixty-nine—the number at which he finally spoke.

“I will tell you a story.” He declared, sounding very proud. 

""A story? Now we’re talking! I love stories, can’t get enough of them! Even if they are bad. I am so desperate for entertainment I will of course be very happy to consume any shit you might deign to squeeze into my face from the holy buttocks,"" I said and clapped my hands, mayhaps with a sparkle in my eye. "" Hey, can I ask you something?""

I didn’t wait for his response and asked. ""Is it one of *those* stories, where good, kind girls get rewarded with a fair-haired and fair skinned prince with a cute little butt?""

""Something like that,"" he said.

I sat cross-legged on the cushioned seat, my eyes alight with childlike wonder. “Go on tell me what is it about,”

""It is a tale that disappoints both optimists and pessimists alike—a tale of faith.""

""Pray tell me if this is a story about a blasphemous man finding faith in God after years of raping and pillaging non-belivers. Such tales will ignite the devotee in my heart.""

""No, it is a tale about someone who sought love. A story I tailored just for you.""

""Oh my! A story tailored just for me? You’re making me blush! I even got: what do men say while watching that play, Dandy Baron Barbarian? They get goose pimples! Yes, goose pimples. I’ve got them. Go on, Father, tell me the story. You got my full attention,"" I said, leaning forward, eyes focused on the purple curtain. 

At the time, I didn’t realize the priest was a man who spoke with two retractable tongues—one angelic, one devilish. Twisted together, they wove this particular tale—and in doing so, the priest became the perfect embodiment of God: the perfect blend of blasphemy and faith.

1kd2xiq,https://i.redd.it/uxq3f33xtdye1.jpeg,RS 50 Most Disappointing Albums Of All Time: #30 Red Hot Chili Peppers-One Hot Minute (1995),"RS Synopsis:

In 1994, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Dave Navarro faced two problems that were the exact inverse of each other. He was a guitarist without a band after the dissolution of Jane’s Addiction. And they were a band without a guitarist after John Frusciante peaced out during the tour for their breakthrough album, *Blood Sugar Sex Magik*. On paper, this was an alt-rock supergroup. But in reality, they had to live up to the legend of both bands. Anthony Kiedis was also deep in the throes of drug addictions, and sessions stretched out for months and months. A few standout songs did emerge like “Aeroplane,” but nothing that will make fans forget “Under the Bridge” or “Mountain Song.” “Navarro’s metallic guitar shredding should have added some weight to the Chili Peppers’ punk-inflected heavy-guitar funk, but tends to make it plodding,” wrote AllMusic’s Stephen Thomas Erlewine. “*One Hot Minute* is as musically ambitious as *Blood Sugar Sex Magik*, but is even more unfocused, which means it provides the fewest thrills of any of the group’s albums.” For their next album, *Californication*, Fruscianate returned to the fold, and the entire *One Hot Minute* era has since been mercifully memory-holed. 

My Review:

The album opens with “Warped” right away you know this is a different kind of chilli peppers record. The intro is  slow & quiet before it explodes into the melodic riff. Kedis’ vocals are distorted and the lyrics are some of the darkest he has ever written. He was battling a relapse throughout the recording of the album and that is reflected in his songwriting. The opening lines of I am pretending to be strong and free hits so hard. “Aeroplane” has a lighter sound than any other song on the album. Lyrically it still has dark undertones. It is one of the few songs that feature some funky grooves that the band was known for. With Dave Navarro on board the music seemed to take a dark punky turn. “Deep Kick” begins with a spoken word story from Kedis about Him and Fleas lifelong friendship. When the music kicks in it has this thick funked up groove. The album closes with Flea handling the vocals for the outro. “My Friends” is this solemn ballad that has Kedis talking about the struggles of the people around him. It may not be on par with “Under The Bridge” but it is still a powerful piece of emotional art. “Coffee Shop” is a straight up 90’s rock banger. I love Kedis’ vocal delivery on this track and Navarro’s guitar tones sound fantastic. “Pea” is just Fla flexing his bass and vocals. As he tells all the macho homophobes to go fuck themselves. When I need this energy in 2025. “One Big Mob” sounds like classic Chili Peppers with its big boisterous funky groove. “Walkabout” might be Navarro’s best guitar work on the whole album. The song has this smooth and relaxed sound. “Tearjerker” is this melodic mid-tempo ballad. The song is about Kurt Cobain’s death and how it affected Kedis. “One Hot Minute” opens with this whimsical bass noodling from Flea before you are hit with the dense heavy 90’s alt rock groove. “Falling From Grace” is a full on funk tour de force. Navarro’s guitar effects add to the weirdness. It's one of the few times you feel the band is actually enjoying the music they are creating. “Shallow Be Thy Game” begins with some fantastic bass playing from Flea. The groove is another mix of funk and heavy psychedelic rock the band was experimenting with with Navarro in the mix. The album closes with “Transcending” Flea wrote most of the lyrics for the song. It's a tribute to actor River Phoenix who Flea was with when he overdosed at the Viper Room. It's a sentimental way to end this dark album. 

Is It A disappointment?

Well yes I guess so but the record was probably doomed from the start. The Navarro and RHCP marriage just didn’t gel in the studio. Navarro wasn’t used to how the rest of the band worked in the studio. It was more of a collaborative jam rather than the isolated writing he was used to in Jane’s Addiction. Kedis was in the middle of a serious relapse throughout most of the album. Also the band lost the heart of their sound with John Frusciante’s departure. Kedis admitted that he felt lost. The band just makes their best music with him. Also they were coming off a monster record in Blood Sugar Sex Magic. All that being said I am probably one of the few who enjoy this record. I love the dark metallic sound they developed with Navarro. I would love to see what they would have done on a second record. So yes in the grand scheme of things this record was a disappointment but it is still a nice listening journey to go on.

Work is usually slow during the weekdays, so I'm on here looking to chat. Usually, I am always able to chat most of the time or day. Looking for something long-term or can just be short-term. I'm down to share photos, too. 

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health. Just started growing some herbs to put in the tea. Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. So, I've been trying different coffee beans to see what's best. Also want to start making different types of bread/sourdough so if know anything about that I would like to learn.

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. 

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Fortnite, ASA, and CS2. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago. I also have a switch that I play pokemon and mario games mainly on. Just got a steam deck, too, and been tinkering around with it. So, if you know any good emulators or anything for it, then let me know.

1kd2xew,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1kd2xew/office_story_gave_her_chocolate_got_a_side_of/,Office Story: Gave her chocolate. Got a side of trauma.,"So here’s some context — there’s this receptionist cum facility manager girl at my office. Elegant, soft-spoken, stylish, northeastern( yes, i have a preference). She’s a contractual employee while i am on the company’s payroll. Usually had just seen her either at her reception desk or in hallways mostly carrying a poker face or glued to her phone. I’ve exchanged glances with her few times but never really interacted until one day she helped me with a minor locker issue over phone, and I wanted to say thanks. I got around 10 days late in saying thanks ( i didn’t get the right opportunity, i am mostly busy and go once down outside for my smoke, plus i asked her help genuinely a couple more times).

So I gave her an exotic chocolate(bite sized) — not creepy(at least I thought so), not romantic, just a small gesture. She smiled genuinely, I smiled back. Wished her a nice day and went back to my business. Nothing over the top.

I thought next day I’ll ask how the chocolate was, it had bitter undertone, not everyone would like it. Next day when i passed by the reception desk i smiled at her and she did too( though it wasn’t a natural one). When i came back from smoking she was on a call, so i didn’t interrupt her. Next day again she was on call during the entire time i went and came back. 

I still hadn’t even asked her name. Never even introduced myself properly. It was all low-key.

Then today(friday), I decided to ask her whether she liked it and ask her out for tea/coffee. In my defense, i was not going to be in office for next three weekdays, it was casual friday, it was raining, the mood was perfect, and felt like the universe was on my side. I walked up and asked whether she liked the chocolate, she had a genuine smile and said yes. I replied that i had a hunch that she had a complex taste and then after a small pause asked“Hey, would you be up for coffee or tea sometime today?” Her smile slightly turned down and she said “No.” I even joked, “Come on, I played Megh Malhar on loop last night to manifest this weather!” but she probably didn’t understand it. With a forced smile, her answer stayed “No.” I respected it, said ok, smiled back, and left.

4.5 hours later — I get called by security and went on to join them in control room. 

“Sir, Did you give a girl chocolates and gifts?”

I was shocked and wasn’t expecting that. I said i only gave a small chocolate — just as a thank you as she helped me out. 

Apparently, she had raised a concern and said a sir had given her chocolates and gifts.

They didn’t bother me and didn’t even ask me to not repeat or something like this. There was no drama, but it felt like my entire vibe got labeled “creep.”

And man… it stung. Not because of the rejection — I’m used to life throwing Ls at me. But because I always try to be fun, kind, thoughtful, respectful yet bold. And somehow, that got interpreted as creepy.

In the last 7 years, it was the only time i tried to ask a girl in office and its the last time i did so.

While you may think there maybe many occasions i fucked up on, the truth is I wasn’t following rule no.1 & maybe 2 of dating.

🌅Sunset Social Hour - (follow the gathering place on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/sunsetsocialtulsa/) hosted at the gathering place. Cool, hip vibes. 

🎨 Creative Mornings is new to Tulsa but is a monthly meetup that also is meant for networking of all types of jobs - creatives, accountants, SAHMs, etc. https://creativemornings.com/cities/TUL

📍Find places you think are cool. Pick a coffee shop, the Tulsa PAC or Guthrie Green, Philbrook (https://philbrook.org/calendar/ ), a brewery and follow them on social media! There are always lots of little local events like trivia nights going on. Become a “regular.”

🫂Keep in mind - friendships take time. It may feel awkward for a bit. Love encouraging people with the “3 strikes you’re out” rule. Give someone 3 tries to see if you vibe. Meet someone at a big group event & if you like them, get their number (meeting #1). Then invite them to something intentional, like an after-work happy hour or a lunch date or coffee on Saturday morning… (meeting #2). Then see how it goes the third time either at a big group or another small hang. Those three tries will let you know if they’re interested in you back or if you guys vibe together.

I hope to find support here as well as support others. I don't know anyone my age or even anyone that I can name who's older that has Afib. So, I've been managing it solo for a while. 

**My Afib History**  
I had my first Afib episode at age 19. I was at a 1-year-old family friend's birthday party (by party, I mean, the one kid, me, my parents, and the kids parents). I got home and my mom and I felt a rapid, irregular heart beat. I was admitted to the hospital for a couple of nights for observation where they ran every test possible (blood work, urine, chest x-ray, EKG, ultrasound, and I'm remembering a rectal exam for some reason) and nothing came back conclusive. While in the hospital, I converted back to normal rhythm on it's own. 

Over the years, I've had repeat episodes that last only a 1-2 days. No other symptoms occur other than feeling the irregular heart beat and discomfort in my chest. At least, I assume it's Afib. I didn't get a smart watch that could do an ECG until a few years ago. This was being managed by my PCP who has prescribed me blood pressure medication and metoprolol (my BP is a little high). Once I got the watch to confirm Afib, he referred me to a cardiologist. 

More recently, let's say the last 5-6 years, I've had one episode every year that lasts 2-3 days. Again, no symptoms other than the rapid heart beat and the chest discomfort. No shortness of breath, dizziness, etc. Literally, I message the cardiology office, we schedule a cardioversion, and by the time we schedule it, I return to sinus rhythm. 

This changed until earlier this year when the Afib lasted over seven days until we did the cardioversion. This was my first time needing a cardioversion. There were no complications. 

The cardiologist office has now recommended catheter ablation due to efficacy and to avoid further complications from Afib. 

**Family/Medical History: Thoughts or known causes?**   
I keep trying to find a cause, but I don't really think there is one. I don't do any streets drugs or prescription drugs that are not prescribed to me (I rarely use cannabis). I haven't had any excessive caffeine (i.e. energy drinks) since college after that first episode. I do drink coffee daily, but this doesn't seem to directly cause Afib. My diet is pretty mixed, but I don't have high cholesterol, diabetes, or blood sugar concerns per my PCP. I drink alcohol socially and a glass or two or wine or serving or whiskey when I'm home, I haven't drunk to excess in a while (though, I was on a cruise last year and definitely did, but no Afib). I also stay pretty hydrated. 

I have no known family history of this. My mom does have palpitations, though never assessed for Afib. She also a history of low blood pressure. 

I am a little overweight per the BMI (though not my favorite unit of measure) but this has also varied over the years. There were years when I exercised pretty regularly and even ran a few 5k's one year and periods where I didn't really exercise at all. Sometimes, my Afib is triggered when I go from walking to a sprint, sometimes, I can go for a run just fine. 

I am a social worker so there are definitely days where stress is very high. 

My only other health conditions are the high blood pressure (which is managed through medication), pet allergies, and recently plantar fasciitis. I also have social anxiety which I am managing with medication and therapy. I know stress can be a component. 

Then again, a cause is really irrelevant, since it seems unpredictable and also I just have it now. Afib: the friend no one asked for. 

**Catheter Ablation: I'm scared**  
So, my ablation is scheduled for August. I have told friends and family this is where we're at. One thing I haven't really shared, mostly because I hide my stress/anxiety well from others, is that I am kind of scared. I've never had any procedure like this done before. Going into my heart at age 37 makes me feel very mortal, like why am I not even 40 and needing this? I'm going to do it, just to be clear, it just scares me. What if something goes wrong? What if it leads to further complications? I know those fears are valid. I also don't know anyone my age that's had this done before so it terrifies me a little. I'd appreciate other folks' experiences with Pulse Field Ablations. 

Anyway, thanks for reading this far. Hope we can all manage this blasted condition as best we can.

* Body battery will never recover more than 18 over night, cap around 20-30 daily and be at 5 near 5PM
* Stress seems inconsistent, I'll get a few body recharges through the day but never at night
* HR and HRV all seem normal and within zone. My first week showed a high HRV, which then dipped and went off for a few weeks, it's self-adjusted and went back in balance. I suspect it's from being on a caloric restriction (-500 cal per day, to a total of like 2200). Maybe?

The watch will give 1 blue bar of stress when I fall asleep then hover around 75 stress all night.

I don't drink alcohol or smoke. I am quite fit, working out 3-4 times per week (rower and bouldering) 34M with a healthy weight. I sleep quite well and have a regular relaxing routine. I will take 1 coffee in the morning, and never eat after 18h30.

Starting to think the watch is not for me, I have been wearing it 24/7 and logging all my activities in it so yeah. Any ideas to troubleshoot it would be appreciated.

A month ago I found out my husband of 11 years whom I have 5 young children with had an emotional affair and flirted with and had coffee with 2 other women while away to get his electrical block.  I found out.  I had to pry the details out.  I decided to fight for the marriage, for the children.  He said he felt like he had blinders on and animosity toward me and when I decided to fight and stay he seen me for the woman he fell in love with.   
He went back to school for two more weeks, he kept his Snapchat blocked me and had coffee with a girl he met on campus. When I found out Easter weekend. (He let me see his phone)  I was crushed.  I didn't find out about the coffee being in the reconciliation period until yesterday.   He swears he's going to do what it takes, and he was addicted to an ego boost and he's not even 100% sure why he did it.  Is there even a way forward from this? I'm at the anger stage.  I don't want to react hastily due to our kids but I need some peers help. 
I feel like everytime I'm like ok let's heal something else comes up. He swears none of them were physical, one hug. We are believers. He put his phone on a monitoring app with no access to the former things willingly.  The first week after Easter he gave all his devices up for the week.  But then he told me the timeline of the last coffee, and it reset all he's done in my mind.  Where do I go from here? How to I find my answer.

I have noticed once I started  Zepbound, I have to pee all the time. I have no other side effects. I never used to be a water drinker, but for whatever reason since starting Zepbound I actually crave drinking water all day and all evening. I can’t get enough of it. I love it. I used to reach for a Diet Pepsi to go with my lunch every day.  I have had maybe 1-2 Diet Pepsis in almost 3 weeks. I just don’t have any desire to drink them. 

I still drink my coffee and my water in the morning. And I can make it through my 1st 85 minute block class without leaving to go to the bathroom, but after that it is a constant issue. Teachers can’t just up and leave and go to the bathroom without finding coverage for their classes.

Not because I was afraid—I stopped feeling fear a long time ago. It was the quiet. Too quiet. Like the world was holding its breath, waiting for me to crack open something best left buried.

I started driving. Visiting the families of the victims. Looking for patterns the others missed. Their homes all had a similar feel: tidy, average, but with an underlying sense of something *off.* The kind of houses where everything looks fine until you sit down and realize no one’s laughed there in years.

Each family gave me the same look. That mix of hope and hopelessness. “You’ll find him, right?” their eyes said. I never answered them.

One evening, I drove three hours to speak with the sister of victim #4—Linda Marquez. She invited me in, made coffee she didn’t drink. She walked like her body was heavier than it should’ve been.

“She said she had a stalker,” the sister told me. “But the police didn’t take it seriously. Said there was no evidence.”

I nodded, flipping through Linda’s old journals. Most of it was routine stuff—work, errands, ex-boyfriend drama—but then I saw something that made my chest tighten.

>

“Son of a bitch…” I whispered.

“Do you know him?” she asked me, eyes wide.

I shook my head. “No. But I think he wants me to.”

Back at my place, I spread the files out on the floor like some kind of madman’s puzzle. Photos, timelines, scribbled notes. I circled every symbol, every phrase the victims wrote or said before they died. And one word kept coming up:

**“Babel.”**

Not the tower, not the Bible. Something else. I searched for hours and finally found it.

An underground group. Ancient cult-like structure. Obscure references in cold cases, unsolved deaths, cryptic symbols. Thought to be inactive since the '80s. Their symbol? A jagged triangle. Left eye. Sacrifice for knowledge.

“You’ve got to be kidding me,” I muttered.

Was this a copycat? Or something worse?

I took the information to the precinct. They looked at me like I was nuts. And maybe I was. But I could feel it now. This wasn’t just some serial killer. This was something deeper. Older. Almost *organized.*

I stayed up for two straight nights after that. Poring over reports, connecting timelines. And that’s when I found her.

Victim #1. The very first murder in the string.

But she wasn’t who we thought she was.

Birth name: *Rebecca Lang.*  
Alias: *Claire Bennett.*  
Real occupation: *former cult member turned federal informant.*

“What the hell have you gotten yourself into, Ward?”

Suddenly, this wasn’t just about murder.

It was about covering something up.

I knocked on the Chief’s door the next morning.

“I need access to sealed files,” I said.

He sighed. “Ward, you’re chasing ghosts.”

“No. I’m dragging them into the light.”

That night, someone broke into my apartment. Didn’t steal anything. Just left something on my bed.

A photo of my mother’s body.

My hands shook for the first time in years.

I stared at the ceiling for hours before saying aloud, “You picked the wrong guy to wake up.”

Since then, I haven't felt like myself. I don't feel ""normal"" and oftentimes feel like an imposter in my own body. 

I wasn't getting too high readings 140/80's to 90's ish, but both of my parents have been diagnosed with HBP due to multiple reasons (alcoholism and emotional), the pill keeps my readings between 110's/70's. However, I've been dealing with awful anxiety and cardiophobia ever since. 

In a way, it feels as if I've been dealt a death sentence and for the past few days my anxiety has spiked to the point I cry every day locked in the bathroom at work or at home when I'm doing whatever. 

Two days ago, I didn't even want to eat and when I did (the food was really dry and I wasn't sitting properly) I felt a sharp pain right between my ribs and stomach which led to another anxiety moment in which I thought ""I knew it. I knew something wasn't right"". 

I went to the E.R. because of pinching pains on my left side (clavicle and arm), and the E.R. doctor just looked and me and asked me If I really was there for that, which made me feel like complete shit to be honest. He did an EKG and told me everything was normal and I wasn't having a heart attack although my BP and HR were high due to my anxiety (white coat's). Gave me sleeping pills (made me feel drunk or drugged) and sent me home. 

Now I'm terrified of eating, moving, every single pain, getting tests done, seeing doctors, to the point I broke down last night and told my mom I felt like I was going to burst at any moment and just wanted to disappear. 

I'm honestly exhausted, both physically and mentally. And nothing seems to reassure my brain that I'm fine. My readings are fine, I'm eating healthier, I'm losing weight, I drink more than enough water (3.75L every day), I have a low salt and sugar intake, I don't drink sodas, and have cut on coffee a lot.

I really don’t post about manifestation, but lately I have been trying to manifest my SP. Now, it has been crazy and I don’t know what all this could mean, so please bear with me lmao. So essentially I have been manifesting this person and idk what all this could mean. 

I lit a manifestation candle for the first time that talked about showing me her in my dream. It was fulfilled. She came into my dream and it was that I came over with flowers to her house and it seemed as if we were already together. Then her name kept popping spelled different ways on Hinge. Now the flame was dancing on this one. I saw 1111 the next day and 111. Then I saw the quote “He knows what’s in every heart.” I’m very devout in my faith. 

I then lit another one as a source of my peace and this time I saw her in my dream again. I was scrolling through her Instagram. She was on a bus and on a strip bar in yellow workout clothing. She had 8 posts in one day. One had “27 minutes ago” written on it. She teaches workout classes and on other posts she had her friends or the people that took her class. 

Fast forward a couple of more days later. I was with another girl (had my arm around her) and my SP was mad and looked upset. We were at dinner or something when this happened. 

The I lit a couple of more candles and this time for a time table and to guide me. 

The dreams I had were I was with her in my dream and she was showing me her water bottles and stuff and she went to a religious school and the verse had Mark 3:7 with God loves you written on the water bottle. I’m not Christian and I looked for verse up and I don’t know why I saw it. 

Couple of days later I’m in Utah (I was there for a week wedding IRL) and I was running around for some reason. Got to my car and took a picture at sunrise and saw her mom wave and say hi to me. 

I woke up after this one and then fell asleep and saw her in my dream. 

Now the last three candles I did. One had the ashes or soot on the top and then one had light ashes in the middle towards the end, and then the last one had the dark soot at the top and this asked if we would meet and have communication in June 2025. 

I’ve done the unbiased method on the pendulum and it says June 2025 is when we would have contact and a connection made. Now idk if she’s coming to wear a live (she travels a lot) or it would be online. June is also my birthday month. 

I’ve seen signs where coffee NOW sits well with my stomach. At first I would have stomach pain. And my SP loves coffee. 

I’ve always loved Diet Coke and she loves it as well. 

I honestly don’t know what these signs mean or anything. I haven’t seen anything build up in the 3D What should I do and how should I go about continuing manifesting her? What could all this mean? Am I close to my manifestation? Am I overthinking this lmao? Am I delulu?

I have been using manifestation meditations. They help me align with my beliefs. I have also been seeing 1111, 111, 333, and 444 everywhere.

Just got off the 12 day NCL Getaway from NOLA to NYC stopping at Cozumel, Grand Caymen, Aruba, Curacao, and the Dominican Republic. AMA

My Review:

I think this was my favorite cruise vacation I have ever taken (will be my 9th cruise). I sailed the Getaway in 2022 at a reduced capacity and was very underwhelmed because of a variety of reasons: cold food, bad service, bad weather (not ncls fault), cancelled ports, and lack of entertainment. However, I loved the ship and its what brought me back to this one. All of these problems were addressed since my sailing in 2022. I’ll go into all of that below.

Price: we got an outstanding price on this trip. We originally booked the ocean view room (2 of us in a room) and 3 rooms total (6 total travelers) and had them at 2,800 for the entire trip (outside of gratuities, travel, and excursions). For that price we were thrilled to do this….. and then it got better. 2 months before sailing I called my cruise consultant about the trip to add on a few celebration packages and she got all 3 of our rooms upgraded to Club Balcony Suites at no extra cost. At first I thought this was due to lack of sales, but the ship was completely sold out. So a 10/10 on cost for the trip.

Room: the room was great. We had 14166 the club balcony suite. The noticeable difference between this and a balcony (room I had in 2022) was a much larger bathroom. Outside of that not a huge noticeable difference. The bathroom had a double vanity sink and a large shower. The room was located well but my biggest complaint was hearing them pickup and put down the chairs at night and in the morning on deck 15 pool deck. I honestly would go down to 13 to avoid this next time, but it wasn’t the biggest deal to me in the end as I’m a deeper sleeper. There was plenty of storage, they cleaned the room daily, shoutout to Agus because he was the nicest person ever who would open our door for us if he was in the hallway when we were walking to the room. (If you were on the ship we had 2 white boards on the door with questions about favorite island, food, excursions, and other things along with our coffee company information lol) room was a 8/10 with point off for pool deck noise with the chairs.

Food: the food was soooooo much better than in 2022. I felt that the Asian food in the buffet (especially the Indian food) was the highlight of the buffet. We typically did the buffet for breakfast or lunch and would go to the dinning rooms or specialty dining for dinners. Breakfast gets repetitive, but all other meals I felt some really great variety that never got boring for me. All the food was always hot and fresh and very few times that I felt the food wasn’t for me. I truly find myself as a foodie and always love eating something unique and beyond typical food catered on cruises but I think NCL hit the spot. Some of my favorites in buffet were lamb curry, general tsos, stir fry pork and eggplant, avocado hummus, sriracha burger, pho, potato salad, mint and feta meatballs, and the sirloin beef. We sampled every now and then a small thing for dinner at the buffet when they had nice options and we really enjoyed the ribs, chicken shawarma, Philly cheese steak, and the beef ranchero tacos. The dining room dinners that stood out were the soy pork belly (my favorite dinner on the cruise), all of the lamb dishes I ate and Chinese pork spare rib. My partner loved her Cajun shrimp and alfredo dinners as well. The only things I disliked were the pineapple chicken and smoked pork loin. Bonus points for the gluten free accommodations for our friend who really liked their options. O’Sheehans was good, wings were our favorite there as they were always cooked right and had a good amount of sauce. We didn’t like American diner much. 9/10 on all food.

Specialty dining: we ate at Moderno, Teppanyaki, and Le Bistro. Moderno was so much fun. All the meat was fantastic and the grilled pineapple was delicious. I avoiding a lot of the salad bar to make sure I ate enough meat to get moneys worth. The banana tart custard was something I dreamed about the next 2 days, I ate 3 of them. Teppanyaki was a great time but we didn’t have the best table. People weren’t getting into the entertainment aspect of it but can’t knock NCL for that. The food was very good and our staff member did a great job entertaining us that were into it. My complaint would be since it’s very close together I could hear other tables entertainment louder than my own at times causing it to clash. Le Bistro was phenomenal. Service was outstanding, steak was the best steak on the cruise ship. The onion soup was better than the onion soup you can get in the dining rooms. 9/10 for specialty dining. 

Drinks/Bars. Bartenders really know how to have a good time haha. The bars knew who we were and usually find a way to prioritize us in a way which felt really nice. We tipped well so maybe that’s the case. Easily our favorite bar was the Sail and Sustain bar behind the Mojito bar. The best sunsets were on that side and their drink of the day is unique and can’t be had anywhere else on the ship. Cucumber cooler was my favorite, but the red bell pepper and croissant mai tai were both up my alley as well. I enjoyed that addition of Suntori whiskey to the drink package and frequently drank that. As others have mentioned Gin 66 is fantastic and turned me into a gin drinker because of it. Bartenders and service overall was great with how frequently they can be found and quick service overall. Cannot emphasize enough how much the service stood out to me. 10/10 here for me. I am not going to knock points for this, but I wish they had more creative drink of the days instead of repeating the same ones all the time (can’t even look at a mango meltdown for awhile). 

Entertainment: really enjoyed most of the shows on the ship. Bring back the 90s was the first show we attended and needed reservations for. It was a fantastic production and you can tell it was a crowd favorite. The magic show was good, but got a little stale at a point but still overall really nice. The magician was Jonathan Hawley from Americas Got Talent. He did some fun tricks for sure, just got a little slowed down trying to fill an hour. The comedians were great. I can’t recall names so please comment if you can who they were. We went to a few of their shows and they did a great job keeping engagement going and filling the time with good jokes. The crew talent show was so much fun. The washy washy lady sang unbelievably amazing but really the entire show was so great. They said we are the first sailing to have one in a long time so it was great seeing these cruise members bring out their unused talents. Entertainment was 7/10, biggest complaint was not enough showtimes and theater filled so fast that you had to show up 40 minutes early to get a seat for non reservation shows. Wish they opened up the illusionarium more and utilized it for other things beyond the small events they did in there. 

Overall ship: the ship was crowded but still navigable for being a sold out trip. The biggest problem was getting chairs to lay out in because they would be fully “towel reserved” by 8 am and hard to find any through the day. I wish NCL did something about reserved chairs. If we had chairs, we never left for more than 10 minutes while some remained empty for over an hour at a time. But we hardly had to wait for dinners, always find tables at the buffet, never felt crowds were overwhelming, and could still find private areas to hang out without problems. Not a ton of kids on the boat, but still felt like a decent amount for being 12 days trip. The biggest problem surprising factor was the difference of people on the boat. It was so diverse! I felt like this was the most diverse group I have ever traveled with, I would say over 70% of the ship were people from outside the USA. I made lots of friends with people from Australia, Poland, Canada, Germany, Japan, Argentina, and England. Lots of great people that definitely had an impact on the trip. There were a few trashy people that were annoying to run into (I’m sure some of you know who when they were always making fools of themselves on the trip) but didn’t let anyone ruin our trip. 

Few other small details:
	⁃	casino was actually a ton of fun filled with some dealers who were great talking to. Actually went home a winner for once and that was really nice to say
	⁃	The shoppes weren’t filled with deals we were ready to jump over. I ended up getting a chain for myself at the dollar inch place, but not much else. Friends bought cigarettes at a good price though.
	⁃	Getting on and off the boat was not bad except for the Caymens, I’ll get to that below. 
	⁃	We didn’t feel forced into photos as much as previous cruises thankfully, we politely declined each time and that was enough for them.
	⁃	We wish they put more movies on the spice h2o TV screen. That was a bummer that they didn’t do that a single time.
	⁃	with the heavy winds a lot of outdoor activities were canceled. This was a bummer because then it left a lot of open gaps in the day.
	⁃	The coffee sucked. We are 100% coffee snobs, but the coffee truly was terrible. We thankfully brought our own pour over coffee setup and made coffee in the buffet by the cup for us and friends. We had some people, including staff, stop by to watch. We own a coffee roasting company so a little free marketing didn’t hurt 😆 thanks to those that stopped by and ordered from our company too! 
	⁃	Surprised there was no mini golf there, feels like that’s common on many ships, wasn’t a problem for us but just felt like they had the space for it.


New Orleans: only spent a day there but loved the city. Felt it was clean and safe to walk around the French quarter and back to riverside area. We walked from the riverside Hilton to the terminal (10 minutes) took 15 minutes from dropping our bags off to getting on the boat. By far the quickest I have ever done that process. 

Cozumel: We went to Buccanos Beach Club. Was actually one of our favorite places on the trip. For 20 dollars, we got entry and the entire amount credited back for food and drink. The water was a little rough but super clean, clear, and full of fish. We ate the shrimp, guac, calamari, and Oaxaca cheese sticks. The food and drinks were really good, taxi for 6 was 30 each way with tip included. Did some shopping around the port after and was able to get authentic Havana Club rum for 20 a bottle. Every shop is trying to sell Mexican vanilla but felt a lot of it was fake. Talked with some locals in town who helped us get the real stuff instead, worth it for sure. Also worked with Bobbie at Cozumel Drug Store for what we needed. Preordered it all before the cruise for pickup and got some great prices on things that were needed. Weather was good overall, had a great day in Mexico

Grand Caymen: worst port of the trip. We got in and the tenders took forever. The day was only 11-5 I believe. However it’s a tender port and we didn’t even get on land until closer to 12:30 with a reservation group of 14 for tender. Thankfully we didn’t have anything booked. The island itself was just boring, everything was expensive, nothing by port to do, and so little time. We all said we wished NCL either extended port times elsewhere and removed this port, or added
In their private island later in the trip instead because it was just a huge bust for us. We bought tortuga rum here but nothing else.

Aruba: we booked with ABC tours directly their jeep adventure tour. 89 a person, 4.5 hours including pickup at the port. Took us through the national park, Indian caves, dos playa beach, and the natural pool. It was such a fun tour, driver was sunshine ray who really did a great job. We walked around the city before and after the tour and got some souvenirs including a travel bag set for the wife, some cigars from LCDH, and some gifts for family back home. It was a great day on the island, next time would do Eagle beach though.

Curaçao. Best port day of the trip by far. We rented a car with Smart Wheels which is located on the dock which is awesome. We were amongst the first off the boat, we ended up getting to the place before they opened. After they got there (waited about 15 minutes) we were in the car and off to our day in less than 10 minutes in a 2023 KIA Caren 7 seater SUV which was great on gas. We drove to Grote Knip beach first and spent 1.5 hours snorkeling. We got there before the beach was even open and used the loungers. We didn’t have to pay as we ended up leaving as they starting asking for money from everyone. We grabbed a smoothie for the road from the smoothie truck which was a must try. They were 6 bucks each and hit the spot. We had blueberry, banana guava, mixed berry, and watermelon. Everyone loved theirs and we would totally do that again. We drove to Playa Porto Mari for our second beach. Another 1.5 hours there. The second beach was 3 dollars to get in and another 3.50 to get a chair. This beach was way bigger than Grote Knip and more for tourists with the facilities present. We still had an amazing time at both and comparing the two couldn’t rank one over the other better. The snorkeling at both really were just outstanding, wish we had more time in Curacao beyond 7-5. We drove back to the port and gave the car back to walk around the city. It was Kings day! The city was filled with orange shirts and tons of people with vendors, food, games, and activities. Curacao is one of my favorite islands and this trip even further solidified that. We didn’t some shopping and walked around the city and just love the colors, art, and everyone is so nice. Ended up buying a few bottles of Curacao Liqueur for myself and gifts. The banana, blue, and orange were the best ones by far. We had coffee at Van Goghs cafe and just spent time exploring the city before being amongst the last to board the ship (still within time and not pier runners!!). I got pretty badly sunburnt this day but totally worth it.

Dominican Republic: this was the only island we did a cruiseline tour with. It was 89 dollars a person and called Go Green Sustainable Coffee. This was such a treat for us. Took a bus around 40 minutes all the way up the mountains to a coffee plantation and roastery called Cafe Del Yaroa. We got to sample 2 coffees, walk the plantation, saw the processes of growing and harvesting coffee, explored their other growing of cacao, avocados, bananas, limes, and mangos. Was fed a huge lunch of chicken, salad, avocados, rice and beans, and some kind of fudge. The shopping there wasn’t tourist prices which was nice. They then drove us to the city and did umbrella st shopping where we bought a bottle of Mamajuana. Really enjoyed the sampling and had to get a bottle! We got back to port with 45 minutes left before boarding so it was a nice full day. Highly recommend this for anyone looking for something different, wouldn’t try to travel there yourself though as the roads were crazy getting there. 

NYC: been through this port before and always hated it. I grew up around the city and moved far away from it for a reason. Always backed up, congested, and was a sad way to end a good trip (outside of the last full travel day being soooooo cold outside and rough waves through the Carolina’s). 

All in all it was a very good trip. This was my longest cruise sailing I’ve done and never felt like I was “sick of anything” by the end, but was ready to get off. As mentioned, biggest disappointment was the Caymens, wish it was a different port or more time elsewhere. We heard others complain that this was a bad trip and they were never sailing again. People always complain though so I took most of it with a grain of salt because we all had an amazing time.

1kd2b25,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kd2b25/can_waterdrop_g2p600_reverse_osmosis_system/,Can Waterdrop G2P600 Reverse Osmosis System Transform Your Tap Water? Detailed Review Inside!,"**Compact and Stylish Design**  
The Waterdrop G2P600 Reverse Osmosis System immediately caught my eye with its sleek, under-sink design. Unlike some bulky alternatives, this system saves space while providing a neat and modern look in the kitchen. It fit seamlessly beneath my sink without requiring major adjustments, leaving room for other essentials. The design feels intuitive, and I appreciated how the component layout, like the cartridge and resin filter, makes installation a relatively smooth process. Even for someone like me, who's not exactly a DIY expert, the instructions provided were easy to follow, resulting in a hassle-free setup.

[Grab Waterdrop G2P600 at the best price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0d2r4gs77/)

**Exceptional Filtration Performance**  
Putting this system to the test, the water clarity and taste were nothing short of impressive, thanks to its reverse osmosis mechanism paired with deionization. It's designed to handle a water TDS level of up to 1000 ppm, ensuring top-notch filtration. Using several checks, I noticed a significant reduction in the odd metallic taste my tap water sometimes has. This system also includes resin filters for enhanced ion exchange, which made a noticeable difference for tasks like brewing coffee or boiling vegetables; neither picked up any strange aftertastes from hard water.

**Convenience in Daily Use**  
Switching from my old filtration system, what struck me most about this product was its convenience. The daily water flow rate is stable and remarkably efficient. It delivers purified water quickly without feeling like I'm constantly waiting for the kettle to fill up. I tested its ability to sustain performance under larger loads by running it for an extended period on those busy days when you're prepping meals and doing multiple tasks at once—it never faltered. The separate faucet included in the box is also a nice touch, making it clear where my mineral-free water comes from, and the flow remains powerful.

**Negatives**  
As much as I enjoyed my experience, no product is perfect:  
- The corded electric feature means you need an available power outlet nearby, which could be an issue for some under-sink setups.  
- Regular resin filter replacement might not suit people who prefer low-maintenance systems.  
- Installation requires a bit of maneuvering for tighter spaces, making professional help preferable for some users.  

**Key Benefits**  
There’s a lot to admire about the Waterdrop G2P600 system:  
- Compact design fits smaller spaces easily.  
- Impressive filtration reducing impurities.  
- Dependable water flow rate for everyday needs.  
- Extra features like a separate faucet for convenience.  

**Rival Brands**  
Having tried competitor models like the APEC ROES-50 and iSpring RCC7, it's worth noting that both offer reliable filtration as well. However, their systems felt slightly bulkier and less space-efficient. APEC does beat it on price for budget-conscious users but lacks the combined reverse osmosis and deionization functionality. The iSpring includes a higher waste-to-pure water ratio, leading to less efficiency compared to this system. Where the Waterdrop G2P600 shines is its energy efficiency, delivering purified water without the guilt of wasting too much.

**Price Worthiness**  
Let's be honest, quality water filtration systems don’t come cheap, but the value provided by this model justifies the investment. Considering its superior performance, modern design, and ease of use compared to others in the market, it certainly feels worth every penny. While some people might initially balk at any upfront costs, the long-term benefits of clean water for your health and daily living far outweigh the expenses.

I work in a medical building which has an interesting layout. I sit at central registration and check-in for all the clinics in the building and there's a ton of foot traffic. We also share the building with a gym. There is no public coffee in our building and I feel that it would be a huge hit for the employees, patients, and gym-goers. Patients are always asking where they can get coffee. I really want to jump on this opportunity and I have multiple years of barista experience. I've been doing a lot of research and am still planning things out but I've given my business plan to my supervisor and her boss as well and they both like the idea. The next person to approach would be the property manager.

My predicament is that my partner and I are also in the midst of partitioning his parent's property in order to build a house for us. I still don't know at what point we'll be applying for the construction loan since this has been a lengthy process to just split the land, but I know if I quit my full time job, that brings our income down to just one steady income from my partner.

We don't have any kids yet, and since we don't have a mortgage we're paying for since we've been living with his parents while until we build the house, there is a lower risk to it. But I don't want this to now jeopardize everything with our house. We've been working with the county and different contractors for over a year now.

Any thoughts on this?? Should I follow my gut and proceed with the coffee cart? We could also potentially have my in-laws co-sign for the loan. Or should I wait on the coffee cart until we've secured a loan with both my current income and my partners?",0,1746195917.0,foodtrucks,1,0.5,False

Do you have preferences on the gifts you receive? Is cash with a sweet card okay, or is a gift card or a personalized gift like a nice water or coffee cup filled with a favorite candy or something else preferred? 

Ideally I'll spend around $30ish per teacher (2 full time teachers). Is that enough?

I start my first treatment of R-chop Monday.  I am terrified of what I am going to be feeling like after, and what I will start to look like around the 2nd treatment. 

I keep hearing about how the treatment makes you bone deep tired amongst other things. I was wondering if anyone found counter measures to lessen how exhausted you feel?  Will coffee help if I can tolerate it? If not what about OTC caffeine pills or even natural energy enhancers? 

I am lucky enough to be out of work while going through treatments, however, I feel I will start to lose my mind pretty quickly being so isolated in doors. I have a family and a dog I enjoy doing things for and spending time with. Walks in the park, cooking, housework, you know the typical stuff.  I'm just trying to get an idea of how limited i will be and how I can possibly counteract it. 

Not to mention the idea of me losing my hair and other physical changes, wondering how my wife will handle seeing me like this,  the weight she will bear from it. Panick over not knowing what exactly is covered through my insurance. Calling them isn't much help. The mental strain it will take on me and my fear of me in turn taking it out on my family. How long will work hold my position before they fill it. Will i have the opportunity to take a small vacation with my family this summer, create memories, if not that then can i go swimming in a public pool or lake.  

These are just a few things that have been running through my mind and i know it sounds like my priorities arent straight with these questions, i know the priority is me getting through it and cancer free. I keep hearing it's normal to feel this way, to be scared. 

I guess on some level it helps to hear if others have stories with any of my concerns listed above. See what helped them and how their experience was/is going. 

Thanks to everyone on this sub,  I lurked and only read on here for well over a year until I received my diagnosis almost 2 weeks ago. Was sick and getting tested for oved 2 years before diagnosis. Reading your stories, questions and answers have in some way helped me keep my sanity, I'm pretty sure all last week I was still walking around in shock. I hardly ate anything for 4 days, lost 10lbs in a week. But I've pulled myself together best i could right now and been eating better the last 2 days and letting all this sink in. Sometimes it feels so surreal, like its all a bad nightmare I will wake from. ",3,1746195593.0,lymphoma,8,1.0,False

Yes, the above is true as ridiculous as it sounds. This man was found guilty of multiple counts of sexual harassment from unwanted kissing and touching of females at a local university a few years back. 

Unknowingly, I made his acquaintance as he was walking around our neighborhood and I was cordial. He found us around downtown a few days later at a public festival. I went into a coffee shop and he followed. Some local police stopped by and asked to speak to me. They said other civilians had called/asked for help as he was harassing other women at the festival. They asked if I knew him and I said kind of, but not really and he knows where I live. Nothing came of that except he out as soon as he saw them. 

Well, several weeks/seemingly normal encounters later, and yes I’m embarrassed to say this, he asked for a hug while we were talking at the corner of my lot. I obliged with a “side hug” and mf grabbed my ass. I told him to leave immediately. I filed an online police report. They called and said they couldn’t do anything/press charges because they weren’t present. I would have to go to the court house to do such. 

He continues to harass us by talking to us from our neighbors porch as he does “yard work” for the old guy. He also harasses other people that walk by. If you are a female, he will literally stop what he is doing to watch you walk away. 

What is the easiest/path of least resistance for me to get this to stop? The cops have came out once to talk to him to leave us alone a few months ago but here he is back at it again thinking it’s okay.

I’m so frustrated because he doesn’t even live here! The neighbors house is directly across the street from us so the porch faces us and we are on a corner lot, so our entire yard is viewable. We have no peace. ",2,1746195487.0,legaladvice,2,0.67,False

**Why This Pick?**

This is a high-scoring affair in my head, friends. One, because I know how capable the Cubs offense is, and two, because 4 of Ben Brown’s last 5 starts saw games with final totals of 14 runs or more (wth…?) I have no doubt that Chicago can bag a few off of Milwaukee regardless of who’s on the mound, but I’m certain that the Brewers will get a few runs off of Ben Brown (hell, everyone has). Take the Over to cash here.

Lately I'd been doing a lot of tarot, getting better, but I wanted to dive into lenormand again, brush up on my skills, see what lenormand has to offer since it's so different from tarot. 

So I pulled 3 cards, open, no question. I pulled Letter, Clover and Ring. And I was like ""eh, idk what that's supposed to mean"" I mean I could interpret it but it didn't apply to anything in my life.

I shuffled, pulled three new cards: Woman, Letter and Clover. So I was like ok it's weird that I pull Letter and Clover again, but I still can't make sense of it. I'm not a woman so I figured this wasn't directly for me, but other than that I drew a blank.

Left my cards laying on the table and went to make coffee, and as I was making coffee
