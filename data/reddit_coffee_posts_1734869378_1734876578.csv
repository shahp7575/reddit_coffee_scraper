Much to spounse's horror, I bought enough to make it through the entire year. I ran out in early November 2024!!
I was pleased when it opened up for purchase again and bought 2 bags initially. 
I will admit, I am crazy disappointed with the batch I received. There is relatively no peppermint flavor at all
Is anyone else a fan and experiences the same this year? I am curious if they changed the processing or if this was just a crap batch",1,1734876445.0,BonesCoffee,0,1.0,False

1hjz29k,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Sarkhana/comments/1hjz29k/foolish_one_duet_form/,Foolish One Duet Form,"# Reasons

 

This seems meant to be a true love 💗 duet between:

* A hellhound/incubus like [Drew](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sarkhana/comments/1ffor4n/antiheroaugustcruel_summer_duet_form/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Let's call him Y.
* His polyamorous best friend/boyfriend. Let's call him X.

===========================

The [lyric video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-x1AlDudZw) helps this, by emphasising the mailbox. As it is core to the plot.

 

# Background

 

X and Y are best friends. They are presumably both male ♂️, as:

* No female ♀️ trait is mentioned
* They act like male ♂️ best friends

Presumably at school/near-ish future orphanage/university.

===========================

X is part of the [family of cancer](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sarkhana/comments/1fu1hbz/family_of_cancer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). He is hyper-intelligent.

He does not like the average human.

===========================

X is openly polyamorous. He has a girlfriend/female friends with benefits.

===========================

Y is a hellhound/incubus. He was sent specifically to be X's true love 💗. Making X soul grow stronger by the presence of true love 💗. Making X more of a menace.

Y is from from literal Hell 🔥🔥🔥. Ironically, he is very innocent and adorable.

Y is hyper-intelligent. Though extremely naïve due to extremely low true age.

Y is virtually incapable of picking up subtly. Only seeing the literal/obvious explanation unless the real one is blatantly obvious.

===

Y's body previously had another Conscious soul. The previous guy ♂️ is presumably dead/moved to a new body.

===========================

Eventually, X and Y hook up.

===

Y starts obsessively checking his emails/text, hoping X will have a confession of love for Y.

===========================

X emails/texts Y to go out e.g. to the cinema. As he loves Y and wants to bond with him.

Presumably this is with other friends as well. Likely X's girlfriend/female friends with benefits is there.

===

This is confession of love, as it shows X loves Y's company. So is trying to find excuses for them to spend time together.

Though Y's naivety means he does not see it as a confession of love. 

===

Y does not go. Presumably because he knows he would struggle to hide is sadness at thinking X does not love him. 

===

X is sad Y did not go out with him.

===========================

The next day at school/near-ish future orphanage/university together, they reconnect.

Presumably, X asks why Y did not go out. And Y makes an excuse.

They are very affectionate towards each other. With them embracing with Y's head on X's shoulder.

===

X is hyper-intelligent so quickly realises Y has irrational paranoia.

===========================

X has much more overt confessions of true love 💗. Presumably by email/text. Including:

>Over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news

That implies X wants to spend forever with Y and move in together. Thus, implying true love 💗.

===

Y continues to be oblivious, due to his extreme naivety.

===

Y continues to be mad at himself for checking his emails/texts, thinking it is futile.

===

X is mad at Y for constantly checking his emails/texts for a confession of love, when X has already given confessions of love.

X wonders how Y cannot see something so obvious.

===========================



# Song

 



**X**

\[X thinks about masturbating himself to sleep again, as Y not going out will stop his plan to have it lead up to them hooking up again\]

 

My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand

Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans

And chances are I will fuck myself to sleep again

 

**Hellhound/incubus**

 

You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high

Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right

And I will block out these voices of reason in my head

 



**Unison**

\[Y thinks it is silly to think he is the exception to X's polyamory, while thinking X's polyamory precludes true love 💗 due to amatonormativity\]

\[X thinks it is silly to think Y is the exception to humans being terrible, due to not realising Y is a hellhound/incubus yet\]

 

And my voices say, ""You are not the exception

I will never learn my lesson""

 



**Unison**

 

Foolish one

Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love

That ain't never gonna come

You will take the long way, you will take the long way down

 



**Unison**

\[Y thinks X won't be ok with Y calling X ""mine"" because of his polyamory\]

\[X avoids calling Y ""mine"" to avoid backing him into a corner, to avoid risks from Y's irrational paranoia\]

 

You know how to keep me waitin'

I know how to act like I'm fine

Don't know what to call this situation

But I know I can't call you mine

 

**Hellhound/incubus**

 

And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof

'Cause when my head is on your shoulder

It starts thinkin' you'll come around

 

**X**

\[confession of true love 💗 as it implies X wants to be with Y forever and move in together\]

 

And maybe, someday, when we're older

This is something we'll laugh about

Over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news

 

**Unison**

 

But then your voices say, ""You are not the exception

You will never learn your lesson""

 



**Hellhound/incubus**

 

Foolish one

Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love

That ain't never gonna come

You will take the long way, you will take the long way down

 

**X**

 

Foolish one

Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love

When they have already come

You will learn the hard way instead of just goin' out

 



**Unison**

 

Now I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands

Sayin', ""How could he not see the signs?""

Oh, you haven't written me or called

 

**Hellhound/incubus**

\[Y thinks the lack of a love confession is a sign X wants to breakup/stop hooking up\]

 

But screamin' goodbye with his silence

 

**X**

\[X realises Y was sent specifically to be X's true love 💗 and thus has an extremely low true age\]

 

And suddenly, I realise the reason why

 

**Hellhound/incubus**

 

'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings

 

**X**

\[X thinks about just having an open marriage with Y just to hammer the point in of his love confession, even if it is likely X doesn't like marriage as a concept\]

 

They have my loving, but you'll get my ring

 

**Hellhound/incubus**

 

And I know that he had the best of intentions

 

**X**

 

And maybe you will finally learn your lesson

 



**Hellhound/incubus**

 

Foolish one

Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love

That ain't never gonna come

You will take the long way, you will take the long way down

 

**X**

\[X sends an email/text directly, literally telling Y that X knows Y has been checking his mailbox for confessions of love and Y is foolish for not realising X already confessed his love for Y\]

 

Foolish one

Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love

When they have already come

You will learn the hard way instead of just goin' out

 

**Hellhound/incubus**

\[Y is happy 😆\]

 

Oh-oh, oh, oh

La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh

La-la-la-la-la

 



**X**

 



Only way you're gonna come

Ooh, you will learn the hard way now

Foolish one

 



**Unison**

 



Sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love

When they have already come

And as you're the one, you should've been goin' out

 



**Unison**

\[X is going to teach Y how to love right\]

\[X and Y know their relationship is true love 💗, hence Y is ""the one"", even if they will continue to have sex with other people\]

 



Foolish one

The day is gonna come for your lessons of love

When all is said and done, foolish one's the one

Even if not the only one

 



**Unison**

 



Such a cute foolish one

 



# Ending notes

 



As a true love 💗 couple, they have Lover as a generic happy 😆 ending.

===========================

As X is part of the [family of cancer](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sarkhana/comments/1fu1hbz/family_of_cancer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), they have Change and I Forgot That You Existed as generic happy 😆 endings.

I was on the phone with sally (bff) and talking with them while on vacation. Not sure how it got brought up but I mentioned how Kathy was very rude to me after this whole ass weekend and driving Kathy to and from the event we were at. Mind you this event with Kathy where she was rude happened in AUGUST 

Kathy and I haven’t spoken since then. It’s not in my best interest to entertain someone who has no problem talking to their friend in such a rude way. 

Tell me whyyyyy. Two days after talking with Sally, Kathy send me a text message along the lines of “hey wanted to take you out for coffee to apologize in person”

My brain is saying that Sally told Kathy about what I said and that triggered Kathy to text me. 

So I ask Sally “did you say something to Kathy”
Her response was “no only if it’s important. Didn’t say anything about what you said. sounds like Kathy did some introspective work and wants to make it up to you”

So here I am on Reddit asking the internet. It’s too much of a coincidence that Kathy would message me 4 months after. Why would they want to apologize unless it was brought to their attention. 

Did Sally lie to me? 

Side note: I have not asking Kathy if Sally told her about what I said.

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of “MomPreneurs”, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*  ",1,1734876085.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False
1hjz1c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1hjz1c3/faith_and_finances_trusting_god_in_tight_times/,Faith and Finances: Trusting God in Tight Times,"Let me tell you a story—a story that starts with me staring at my bank account, which was serving more as a cautionary tale than a reflection of my hard work. I had gone through a period when every dollar felt like it was doing a weird dance: two steps forward, one giant leap back. You know that feeling? As if your money has a mind of its own and just decided to take a vacation without you. 

During those times, my faith was more than just a catchy phrase I tossed around on Sunday mornings. It was my anchor, amidst the swirling chaos of overdue bills and a dwindling cash flow. I remember this one night, knee-deep in spreadsheets and feeling like the world's worst entrepreneur, I sat in my living room, surrounded by a pile of bills that practically had their own zip code. I could either panic or pray, so I opted for the latter. 

And you know what? In that moment of prayer, amidst the reality of my financial fears, I was reminded of Philippians 4:19: “And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.” This promise hit me like a cold splash of water. It wasn’t a guarantee that my finances would magically fix themselves overnight, but it gave me a flicker of hope. Somewhere in the depths of my financial mess, I realized that financial resilience isn’t just about knowing how to strategically budget or sowing pennies into investments. It’s about faith that nudges you forward, even when your path is murky.

So, how do we build that resilience practically? Here are a few nuggets I discovered along the way: 

1. **Embrace a Budget**: Start jotting down every dollar spent, whether it's a coffee or a fancy brunch. It's like keeping a diary for your money—less dramatic, but equally revealing.

2. **Create an Emergency Fund**: Think of it as your financial safety net that catches you when you misjudge the tightrope of life. It doesn’t have to be huge; even a couple of hundred bucks can go a long way in calming the chaos.

3. **Seek Community**: Surround yourself with people who inspire financial growth. Share your challenges, swap tips and, believe me, it makes all the difference when you can lean on your network. Those moments of vulnerability and camaraderie are pure gold.

4. **Stay Informed**: Knowledge is power, except when it comes to your old high school math equations. Take the time to learn about financial management, investments, and savings tactics. There’s a ton of free resources out there. Maybe even join a class. 

5. **Practice Gratitude**: This one sounds fluffy—I know. But trust me, finding joy in what you have, even if it’s just imagining a plate of your favorite food while you’re munching on instant noodles, can keep your spirits lifted. Gratitude centers you and reminds you of what's truly valuable.

6. **Trust in the Process**: This is the tough one, right? We want instant results. But remember that God has a plan. Sometimes, your journey to financial stability is part of a bigger story; one that shapes who you are and strengthens your character.

Financial struggles can crush your spirit if you let them. But with faith guiding your steps and a solid foundation of practical strategies, you can navigate those turbulent waters. So, whether you're circling the drain or confidently striding ahead, don’t forget you're not walking this road alone. Embrace the community around you and trust that faith will help shape your financial future, even when it feels like your wallet is playing hide and seek.",1,1734876075.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

I recently got myself a DeLonghi Eletta Cappuccino, excited to make barista-level cappuccinos at home. However, after several attempts, I’m starting to feel a bit defeated. The cappuccino I’m making isn’t as smooth as I’d like, and the coffee itself has a bit of a sour taste.

I’ve tried tweaking the settings and have experimented with at least three different types of beans so far, but I haven’t landed on that “magic combination” that works. I’m wondering if it’s just me, or maybe the machine isn’t living up to the hype.

Does anyone have a tried-and-true setup (specific beans + machine settings) that works wonders with this model? I’d love to hear any tips or recommendations before I consider sending it back.

We have Siemens TQ713GB3, fully automatic machine. Was okay with, super convenient, no much prep work and gives a lot of coffee drink choices. We like hot or iced lattes, capuccino, flat white. 

But dilemma started when my tiktok feeds flooding me videos of people making their coffee like a brista at home. I got hooked to coffee making asmrs. I once work in a cafe and we have all those fancy machines and I get to use it once when I was the earliest person in the shop. I like it but I was intimidated, I failed at steaming the milk. That's why I bought the fully automatic. But I wanted a change now, still keeping the siemens but want to experience the fun but complicated part of making a good coffee, and by looking up for beginners friendly machine....here were my options:

1.Ninja Luxe Cafe Premier: I like that its got built in Grinder and I don't have to worry about dialing as it will automatically recommended. I like the cold froth for iced drink and hands free milk foamimg (I'm scared of this part) while it kinda contradict my plan to enjoy the process. I think the PF is weird.(not a fan of the desogn) Its techy and convenient but again contradicts my plan to fully understand the process. This was my first choice, wasnt supposed to be looking for other options but disappointed with their promotion..  they do offer 10% discount but the EM is excluded from the promo. 🤐so just left it expire in my cart...

2.Sage Barista Express: I like that its got a built in grinder too. (Without fully knowing why its not really always great to have it built in) It has a good feedbacks from people who owned it. Its one of the best seller and a top recommended for beginners. I like that its semi manual. Its on big sale too, was just waiting in my cart till I finally decide. 

3.Gaggia Classic Evo: it looks like a sturdy machine, i like the retro look, honestly... I prefer this kind of style than techy robotic looking ones. You get positive and negative feedbacks so I crossed it out. Plus I don't think I can do mods myself.

4. Lelit Anita: mainly just because I really like the design, but it has quite a few bad feedback. 

5. Bambino/Bambino Plus: Its small and no grinder, but according to what I've read is a great machine for the price and size. A little intimidating as I wasn't planning to get a separate grinder at first. I like that u have options to do auto/manual milk steaming.

So.. Just from reading here in reddit and some videos, I understand that its always best to have a separate grinder and EM and considered situations like if either a built in grinder or EM broke down I will need to get another unit. Or I want to upgrade just the machine I will still have a grinder... vice versa.. Also, even being just newbie I've been eyeing some beast machine already. I like the rocket and lelit bigger machines... Hoping that I would be really invested to this as hobby and will upgrade to one of those in the future...

So finally, last night I ended my search and I ordered Sage Bambino Plus + Baratza Encore ESP combo. The discount codes I got from Kevz(coffeebog) was one of the main reason how I got the combo, I was actually going for the Sage Barista Express as they were on sale for £480 on amazon (BEE+SBP £599). Although I really thought a built in grinder is a big NO, I just couldn't stop thinking about buying a machine already and want it right away as Christmas gift for myself. Luckily... I saw Kevs comment about discount codes,I got 15% discount code from him. 

Hope I really made a right choice, and with the plan of upgrading sloywly as I learn. I'm really looking forward to exciting days of making coffee... I don't mind some tears if it gets too complicated, I already prepared myself for it 😅",0,1734875822.0,espresso,1,0.5,False

Bonus points, should you know where that reference comes from!

I really can't be concise, when it comes to writing a roleplaying advert to save my life. So, you may as well get yourself a cup of tea or coffee, and get comfortable!

I am a 23 year old roleplayer who hails from the dark, mysterious lands knows as Eastern Europe. More specifically, I come from Poland, and at the time of writing this, this means I am in the CET time zone. I've done collaborative writing for about half my life at this point, and while I've only made the switch to the English language faaairly recently, I'd still consider myself at least decent! Other than writing, I also love anime, j-RPGs, tea, as well as anything that happens to have fur and walk on four legs!

One thing that I might want to devote a paragraph to, is that I love to form personal connections with my writing partners! Of course, for one that means that I prefer to eventually befriend my writing partners, but it is not *just* that! The reason that strong OOC is so important to me is because for me chatting about the story, discussing the what-ifs, fangirling, laughing about it, to the point of outright mockery are what makes half of the fun in this hobby for me! So, while I do understand (and to a degree, empathize with) the people that prefer to remain distant and to the point with their writing partners, I will tell you that I am not the right fit for you, if what I'd just said describes you. But, if you agree with me on what I said earlier, great, and please do read on!

Another thing that is important is that I am a trans-woman. As this is my personal account first, and my collaborative writing account second, it's pretty easy information for you to find out on my profile. In other words, I might just as well cut to the chase, and point it out right here. So, if you've got the slightest problem with that, then do me a kindness and do not message me!

Now, with all of that out of the way, there's a short list of things I have to go over, before properly getting into my preferences!

1. Please do not message me unless you are at least 20 years old of age, *or* older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least once per day, and the ability to write more is appreciated. Real-life always comes first, but if you know that this requirement will be a problem, then we will unfortunately not make a great fit.
3. At the moment of writing this advert, I write exclusively over Discord and I ask the same of my partners. At the moment, I am not interested in trying any alternative sites.
4. I absolutely refuse the use of face-claims of any kind in the roleplay, and this is non-negotiable. I am more partial for visual references for other things, such as objects, buildings, or monsters however.
5. Explicit content, that being >!smut!<, is unlikely. At the moment, I strongly prefer to fade-to-black.

Okay, that should most likely be it!

The most important thing about me, as a collaborative writer, is that I, in a way, come empty-handed. Why? Simple! When it comes to everything within the roleplay, from the characters, the story, the setting, up to the greater world-building is something that I prefer come up with *together* with my writing partner! The main exception are mainly monsters, that I may, or may not outright steal from DnD, various video games, mythology or folklore. You get the point! I'm 100% aware it's not the perfect approach, and why some people do not want it, but I do not believe in perfect, and if you think alike, then that's great, and we may be able to create some magic together!

A very important thing is my main source of inspiration. That being, j-RPGs. Obviously, for one that means that I will often want and seek to use the tropes and story-telling conventions from the genres that don't translate too poorly into text. What is more important though, is that it means that I prefer for the stories I create to be structured a lot like a j-RPG, or for that matter, a DnD campaign. For one, this means that I want to, over the course of the story, control not just a pair of two leads between us, but a whole traveling party! I love ensemble casts, and I love exploring different conflicts, traumas and dramas in a single story. Other than this, I love the aspect of them all going from town to town, braving different dungeons, facing a diverse range of antagonists and other perils, while an over-arching threat looms on the horizon!

So, yes – as you probably have already guessed, I prefer stories that have very high stakes. I love tension!

What are the exact themes and the plot of the story is something that is very much open to discussion, and something I have no true preference in regards to. So long the story is a fantasy epic, and so long it isn't a military saga!

What I do have a hard preference on, however, is the setting.

I want the setting to be a fantasy world. Specifically, an **URBAN** fantasy world, and even more specifically, the kind of urban fantasy world where magic is the furthest thing from being a secret. This means that I prefer to avoid the approach that is taken by such books like Harry Potter, the Twilight series, or Percy Jackson series. (Do not get me wrong, I love Percy Jackson!) My personal approach is much closer to such titles as: Final Fantasy VII/VIII/XV, Wax and Wayne novel series or Legend of Korra. So, essentially, to describe what I want, I would say this: imagine your standard medieval fantasy world, and then imagine that it's experienced an industrial revolution. At the moment I think I would prefer something akin to the level of advancement in Final Fantasy VII/VIII. But, as long as our world-to-be has at least the steam engine, I'm more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I also prefer to go out of my way to say that unfortunately, at the moment, I will not consider writing a pre-industrial fantasy story. I've already got one, and I'm not really hungry for more.

Now that said, I still tend to use a lot of tropes from medieval fantasy. I just like to put a more modern spin on them! For example, think of a monster slaying guild, that acts like a modern day corporation or a government service, like the fire department, with all the good, and bad that both imply! I also prefer when duels and small scale fights are done with swords and sorcery, rather than guns and bullets. (I usually like to have one, maybe a few of dedicated gunslingers per story, but that's it.) So, some level of willing suspension of disbelief is pretty much required!

In terms of action in general, I should also mention that I do not really like to focus on realism when it comes to the action scenes. Let me put it this way: while my characters would typically be considered cannon fodder in the particularly overpowered verses, such as Dragon Ball, the Invincible or One Punch Man, they would still be considered OP by the standards of the more grounded, realistic settings. A particular example is that dodging and parrying bullets is not unusual in my writings. Or even characters that can wrestle with actual bears.

Since I have already mentioned that I love ensemble casts, it should go without saying that the ability to write varied and diverse characters that differ in their age\*, gender, social status and background, moral alignment, romantic orientation as well as personality is an absolute must! It might seem like a tall order, but I promise the same in return. I do not have any specific requirements as far as your character goes, other than that she is a woman, as well as that she is skilled in some form of combat. The latter is simply necessary, considering the type of stories that I like to write!

\*That said, the majority of characters should be 21+, if not 25+.

While I do not outright require that our lead characters are to become romantically involved, I am probably not the partner for you if you are against writing all and any romance altogether.

Speaking a little more of romance, while I am only really interested in FxF for the main pairing, I actually prefer if you are willing to write other gender combinations for the side characters. Why? That's simple – I enjoy variety, and I do struggle to find it believable, when there's only one pairing combination ever present in the story.

I think when it comes to the preferences regarding the stories I write, this would be about it! Let me actually talk about writing itself!

So, my general approach is that while I surely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone, I also do not believe in padding the replies for sake of quotas or standards. I also do not really believe in labels, but 'advanced literate' suits me best of 'em all. My replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words per reply, but depending on the need and scale of the scene, they can get much longer. Two, to three times longer. When it comes to the flowery kind of language, I tend to liken it to salt in cooking. Amazing in moderation, but it very quickly stops being so amazing, if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot. I also write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, as well!

I will gladly provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life storylines, werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel or HP), arranged marriage, school settings

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

... phew!

This did turn out a whole lot longer than it could have, but kudos to you if you actually made it this far!

On the other hand, if you've only skimmed it and don't feel like reading the whole thing, i recommend that you do so anyway. It's long as @#\^&!, probably way too long, but the reason it *is* so long is to ultimately save the time of people that may not be compatible. Would you rather waste ten minutes of your time or a whole week? Your choice!

Also, no, there's no password hidden anywhere in here, in case you're wondering.

When you do message me, please tell me: how may I call you, what are your pronouns, what is your time-zone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable enough to share), and most importantly, a starting pitch for us to plan a story! Now, this post doesn't provide any actual ideas by any means, so all I am actually asking for is basically a starting point for us to begin our discussions! You may as well just tell me about the kind of personal dynamic you've been wanting to explore lately, or a particular trope in fiction that you enjoy! Or, something else to that effect. I also do not really care whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit DMs. Just to warn you though, I will probably want to stay there for at least a while, before I feel comfortable enough to actually exchange Discord handles.

That's everything! If you think we may be a good fit, please reach out! If not, have a great day, or night, regardless! Take care!",1,1734875696.0,AdvLiterateRP,0,0.99,False

I know it's silly, but as someone who's anxious about everything, words mean a lot so I try to hold myself accountable for everything I say. 

September was a blur but this is about the time when I'd stop talking to anyone. I was hospitalized due to my GPN acting up and I realized I had no one to tell about it. No one to find comfort in. 

Last October, I gave away my laptop to a student from my alma matter in guise of being helpful and giving back. The truth is, I see no use for it. I used to play TFT a lot, reaching chall in NA, but it never amounted to anything. I've tried connecting with people, offering free coaching but I just ended up feeling more isolated than ever so I let go of my laptop. No one ever invites me play anyway. 

Last November, I've tried ""whoring myself out."" I've dated and slept with a lot of people, most of which were one night stands. Sex was nice and all but the feeling afterwards was mostly empty, devoid of any meaningful human connection. I had hoped to find meaning and strength to continue from another person to no avail. 

This month, I've been consuming depressing media—songs, series, anime, & movies. Anything I can find, I consume. I'd read on reddit and suicide notes of other people to really immerse myself in that headspace. It is fucked up. I know. 

And I think I'm getting there. There's still doubt in my mind, but I'm not seeing things change anytime soon. I don't have any friends that would reach out to me and I'm estranged from my family so literally no one would care when I die—not that they'd know anyway. 

Right now, I'm at the point where I've barely eaten anything. I've only consumed black coffee and some biscuits these past few days and my appetite's not showing any signs of improvement. I've been getting awful headaches, probably from the lack of sleep. My body literally feels heavy, my mouth tastes metallic and my brain feels foggy. I haven't showered nor changed clothes in 2? maybe 3 days and dust have started to accumulate because I can't be bothered to clean.

I've already attempted killing myself earlier this year, but I got lucky (or unlucky) that someone found me before it was too late. The days leading up to it were some of the most peaceful days I've had in years and I want to experience that again. I want to feel carefree, without a single care for the world, and no anxiety for the future. After all, why would I care when I'd be dead?

1hjyudw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hjyudw/the_sixth_siege/,The Sixth Siege ,"From across the city Hiram heard the whistle, then the thumps of artillery, followed quickly by the tremendous cacophony of a steam explosion. The hair on the back of Hiram’s neck stood up in recognition. During the siege of Freeport, he was standing entirely too close to a freighter when a lucky shell struck and the boiler exploded. He’ll never forget - try as he might - the sounds and the smells from that catastrophe.  



He couldn't hear the screams of those injured, but he knew from experience what it sounded like, and was silently glad he didn’t have to hear it again. Even though he was a magic user by trade, he knew all too well how much damage mundane machinery makes when it was explosively taken apart. Dust and plaster fell from the ceiling and Hiriam put his hand over his mug to protect his coffee, and his silver rings clink on the ceramic. To make the building shake at this distance, the train must have been at full pressure. There were sure to be injuries from falling red-hot steel. Better to stay inside for a while longer.



Hiram had been ordered by the Invar Royal Magisterium to observe the Velmarians and try to gauge how powerful their magical forces were. Velmar historically did not invest in the thaumaturgical arts, preferring machines. For some reason, during this campaign season, magic was seen across the battlefield combined with the mechanized war machines they already had that proved to be a deciding force. Velmar’s newest leader had decided that a war of conquest was just the thing to get his people’s minds off the recent coup that installed him, and he was unfortunately correct. The vitriol spewing from the Velmarian press about the Invarians would make a military general blush. Hiram did not know a lot about mundane matters, but he did know that Invarians did not in fact eat their infirm. 



*Surely there were others at the Magisterium who could have been sent to observe?* Hiram silently cursed his superiors. *It’s not like I’m the only one who has ever reported on magic use among an enemy. Why me?* Hadn’t he seen enough destruction? But no; they told him how skilled he was, how observant; the honeyed words all the sweeter to their ears because it meant that they would not be the ones going into a warzone.



He sighed and then blew the dust from the back of his hand as he heard the volunteer fire brigade run past, their brass bell ringing to order people to step aside. Better to sit here and drink coffee; watered down, but at least it was still real. The carnage wasn’t caused by magical means, Hiram didn’t need to add another tableau to his nightmares. This was one of the few places that still had access to real beans. Being a city under siege had led to shortages. People were roasting nuts, seeds, tubers, whatever they could find, just to try and make something that looked like coffee. All those cups of trickery did was reinforce the fact that the Invarians were scraping the bottom of the barrel while also pretending things weren’t as bad as they were. It wouldn’t even be that bad if they just called it “coffee substitute”. But no, the cafe owners and cart proprietors had to call it coffee and stand there smiling blithely as if you didn’t know it was just acorns roasted black.  



The announcement that all trains would be considered military targets didn’t suprise Hiram in the least. The city had already been surrounded for two weeks, and the folks that Hiram spoke to were surprised how quickly things were running out. Hiram was not new to a siege, and was more familiar with how quickly a city will run out of provisions. Cities are alive, and require regular meals of people and supplies to be healthy. Starve a city and it will die quickly. Worse, they did not attack every train. Either by accident or by design, a macabre lottery was brought into being. You never knew if you had boarded the right train.



 Burgomaster Ulmar had ordered the trains to run anyway. A city leader, dressed in a military style uniform, his self-awarded medals straining against a middle with too many rich meals and too few hours spent walking about his city. Hiram was all too familiar with that type of leader. At least the Burgomaster of Freeport had tried to encourage blockade runners and smugglers to bring supplies in. Ulmar was trying to bluster and swagger his way out of the crisis instead of trying to find help.



In the early days of the siege, people had streamed aboard the trains hoping to outrun the Velmarian artillery, but the accuracy of the Velmanrians ended that hope with a finality. They knew from where the trains would be coming, so every time one left, they could - if they so chose - fire artillery the moment the train was in range. As the days pressed forward, so too did the artillery. Hiram gripped his mug tighter as he tried to avoid coming to terms with the fact that the artillery was going to strike the buildings and walls of Terminid very soon, probably before this time tomorrow.  It was only because Terminid was at the end of the northern rail line did they have trains to run at all. 



Just this morning he'd overheard from a porter buying a broadsheet that there were only two trains left. One was now destroyed. Despite that, he was certain people would be flocking to the remaining train. It was their only hope of leaving a city quickly running out of resources. Being killed by a bomb was a much preferable death to slow starvation. People also tried to escape through the forests, but that route held its own dangers.



Hiram sat in the empty cafe and unfolded his broadsheet as more people outside rushed towards the site of the explosion. The rescue forces had already passed, so this was just plain folks going to gawk. Entertainment was thin in a besieged city, so they did what they could. Difficulty in getting ink and paper meant that *The Caller* had been reduced to a single page, but at least it was something to read. News outside the city was scant and unreliable, but everyone that could still picked up their paper and read, grasping at some semblance of routine in the besieged city. He could have stayed in his hotel room and planned his exit, but Hiram decided to go about his business as normally as he could. He learned from the siege Cliffwing knew that sitting around waiting for the inevitable was no way to live. His knee throbbed at the memory of his fall there.



“Another coffee sir?” Even though Hiram was the only person here, the server still walked up with a smart silver cart. Only the top had a single pot of coffee and one plate of pastries under a glass cloche. “A pastry perhaps?” 



Hiram liked this cafe, as not only was it close to his hotel, but it had a refined, elegant ambiance. The tile floors and gas lamps felt modern, out of step with the rest of the city.



“No, thank you.” Hiram started to fold up his broadsheet. If the server was asking him if he wanted seconds, then it was time to leave. 



The server lifted the cloche. “Please sir, at least take a pastry. For free. The ovens are hot and we’re trying to use up the butter and flour before it spoils. Timmins the owner left yesterday, and told us to throw away what’s left. Can you believe it?” The server shook his head. “What a waste. Naturally, we’re ignoring him and trying to cook as many things before we leave. Please. Take one.”



Hiram’s hand hovered over the pastries for just a moment. He knew that others needed food more than he did. His once ample frame had done its work helping to shield him from some of the ravages of hunger this time. Still, it would be rude to refuse at this point. He selected a small  butter danish and took a bite. It was hot and flaky, and his stomach did an exemplary job reminding him of the last time he ate. Meals had been thin and light as of late, as resources dwindled. Too often Hiram passed over eating so that someone else could when he was in a besieged city. He never regretted it. *The faces of the children in Ligninville as he handed them the sack of apples he bought with more money than they had ever seen in his life. Their cries of joy as something as simple as an apple was better tasting than any cake they would eat.*



His unnaturally striped nails showed the scars of someone who was intimately familiar with starvation. Less visible were his false teeth, a souvenir of his first siege, New Draftover when he contracted scurvy. He could have healed them magically, but the dentures didn’t bother him too much - most of the time - and he felt it would have been an insult to the memory of those that were lost when he survived. It had been a while since things had gotten that bad, but the stomach remembered. 



After eating the pastry he said “Take the rest to the Church of the Revenant. They’ll hand it out to those who need it.” Hiram gave him a gold guilder and the server blanched.



“Sir, I cannot give you change for that.” His whisper was loud in one of those random moments of silence when there was commotion outside. People had started dragging stretchers back from the site of the explosion, and Hiram determinedly did not turn around to look at them. The gold coin was probably more money than he had seen in a month.



Hiram snapped his coin purse shut, stood, and tucked the broadsheet under his arm. “I expect no change. Please take it. There is precious little I can spend it on here, maybe after all this is done you can make use of it.” What use was money when there was nothing to buy? The coins in his purse laughed at him when they jangled as he walked. Even the richest person in the city couldn’t buy safety right now.



“Y-yes sir, thank you.” The server walked to the back of the empty cafe staring down at the coin, his cart ignored. Hiram’s hand reached out and grabbed another pastry, almost without him realizing it, and walked out. 



He stepped into the crowd of people dragging and carrying the injured and dead to St Helena’s hospital. Nearly as soon as he found his footing with the crowd, the deafening sound of a cleft opening - like the Goddess herself ripping cloth - made him stop. People screamed and flowed around him like water as they tried to escape the magic happening in the sky above them. Hiram stood fast, planting his feet against the crowd and set his shoulders against people bumping them. As the cleft finished forming, an artificial silence descended. It was as if his ears were stuffed with rubber bungs. The people around him, desperate to escape, were still yelling and screaming, but Hiram heard none of it. He must be directly under the cleft for that to happen. He was hearing the silence on the other side being transmitted through. Opening a cleft that large was not simple magic to perform, it took a group of five magisters hours at least to make a medium sized opening from scratch. 



He looked up at the cleft. The sky had split asunder, the ragged edges of *there* and *here* had a painful purple and black border. Through the rending of space, he was able to look up and find that he was looking *down* upon another city from a height that was probably very close to the height of this cleft. The other city was very similar, though not identical. For one, that city was not currently being besieged by Velmarian forces; they wouldn’t attack their own city. In the silence pouring out of the cleft, he could hear sirens in the mirror city. If he focused, he could see the bustle of people in the mirror city as well. It looked to be sunny there. Hiram wondered if the residents of that city looked up in surprise or satisfaction at the cleft.



For just a moment, Hiram wanted to shout to the people panicking around him that this was an incredible use of magic, something like this took decades of training and required the work and effort of possibly dozens of magisters. It was… *beautiful*. He reached into his pocket without taking his eyes off the cleft and clicked a stopwatch. He could feel it ticking, the potential energy of the tightly wound spring being converted to a motion; a power different to his own, but still, power. 



Finally, he could see what he came all this way for. 



Ignoring the view of the city and tearing his mind away from the feat that he was witnessing, he estimated the size, stability, and power output of the opening. This was a larger cleft than the Velmarians had ever cast before. 



Motion caught his eye. Hiram saw dirigibles, huge and grey, trying to reach the cleft. Oily black smoke streamed from rockets attached to the gondolas, a dangerous attempt to make the dash across to rain destruction on Terminid. Before the attackers could traverse the cleft, and find their targets, the tear was closed. Hiram clicked the stopwatch again and took it out. Seven and three tenths of a second. He put the stopwatch away and looked back towards the street, his face carefully neutral. Last week they could only hold a cleft open for five, and they had never attempted one large enough to send dirigibles through.



With the sealing of the cleft, there was a moment before the sounds came rushing back. Hiram blinked and winced at the screams. Everyone was still around him in a blind panic. If he wasn’t careful now, he would be knocked down and trampled, an ignominious end to Magister Hiram Hilman.  Fortunately, the crowd was still streamed towards St Helena’s and his hotel was on the way. He moved with the crowd, silent as they screamed, face thoughtful as their were twisted up in fear. Hiram had a flash of realization as he continued back to his hotel. He should be more frightened. This was objectively a terrifying thing. Not one hour ago, the Velmarians destroyed a train and killed hundreds. Then, a few seconds ago, they attempted to bomb the city via air by means of the largest cleft he had ever seen. The Velmarians were pushing to end the siege, they were no longer content to starve everyone out.  Come to think of it he had noticed that as of late, he… felt things less intensely. He could recognize situations when he would be happy, or satisfied, or frightened, but he… didn’t feel them. He had a job to do, there was no time to be frightened. If he told himself that enough times, he would eventually believe it. 



The Hotel Ocularum wasn’t the largest hotel in the city, it wasn’t the nicest, nor the cheapest. However, it *was* close to the Magisterium and because of that it still was popular with visiting faculty. The crowd was thinning enough so that Hiram could make it to the edge and was able to push through the revolving doors, and was rewarded with being nearly knocked over by a porter wheeling a cart full of crates and boxes towards the back exit. Waving away the hurried apology, he went to the front desk.



The clerk was nowhere to be found. Hiram peeked around the large dark counter and found that it was cleared out. As he dithered about going behind the counter, the day clerk appeared from the back room, wearing their coat and carrying a canvas tote. “Magister Hilman! I thought you had checked out!” 



Hiram winced at his title. He didn’t feel like a Magister, an expert at the thaumaturgical arts. He barely felt like a person these days. “I am checking out tomorrow. I have a ticket for the train.”



As the clerk threw pens and papers and other things into his bag he quickly looked at Hiram, maybe to see if he was joking. Seeing his expression he went back to his packing. “You’re going to risk the trains? Magister-”



“Hiram is fine. Mister Hilman if you must.”



“Mister Hilman. The hotel has closed. We’re all leaving in anticipation of the Velmarian’s entering the city tomorrow.”



Hiram thought back to the cleft and the dirigibles rocketing towards it. “Have you heard any specifics?”



The clerk shook his head. “Nothing official. But everyone thinks they’re going to make their move tomorrow, Augury said that it’s coming tomorrow, before midday for sure.”



Hiram frowned. He didn’t trust Augury to divine the weather if they looked out a window. Still, he couldn't completely ignore their predictions. Coming or not, he still had to submit his report and leave the city. He’d have to send something tonight… just in case. “Nevertheless, I have a ticket for tomorrow’s train and I do not relish the thought of spending the night sleeping fitfully on a bench in the station. Can I keep the room?”



“You’re going to stay here overnight *yourself*? Most of the staff has left already. It’s just me and a few porters cleaning up.”



Looting most likely. Hiram couldn’t blame them though. Plenty of things could be bartered for some food and they weren’t doing anyone any good locked up in a hotel. He’s done more than his share of… liberating items that were no longer needed from those with no means to recover them. 



The clerk stopped looting and looked back at the keys and then to Hiram. He went back to stuffing things into his bag. Hiram watched for a few seconds and couldn’t help but think of ways to defeat the clerk so he could at least go up and collect his belongings. The thought brought him no satisfaction and only made his stomach sour, ruining the pleasant feeling of the pastries from earlier. 



“Gods damn it.” The clerk swore and placed the key on the counter. “You’re welcome to your room, Magister. In fact,” he rummaged behind the counter and produced a bottle of brandy, “here. Please take it. We’ve got more than we can carry, and it’ll just get taken by the Vels.” His smile carried no joy behind it. “You could always just get wasted and await the Vel’s entrance into the city.”



Hiram’s knee twinged as he reached out slowly towards the bottle. Alcohol was not curative, but it might dull the memories for a bit. “Uh, thank you, uhm…?”



“Warren, sir. My name is Warren.”



“Thank you Warren. I wish you luck. May the Bright Lady smile upon your escape.”



Warren smiled lopsidedly. “I don’t need Her blessing, but thank you all the same.  Me and a few people from the neighborhood are going to cut through the woods. We’re going to stay off the main roads and away from the rails. That should keep us away from the Vels. You know how they are with people they capture.” Hiram *did* know. Velmarians had an unpleasant tendency to practice marksmanship on the lucky captives. The sight of the unlucky captives still haunted his nightmares.



Hiram’s eyes narrowed. “Are you sure that’s wise, Warren? The Woodfolk-”



“We’ll be fine Magi- er, Mister Hilman. My buddy Fenchuch says she knows some Woodfolk and they’ll let her pass. She’s sure if she vouches for us, we’ll be fine too.” Warren turned his head away from Hiram quickly. He apparently had decided that anything Hiram had to say wasn’t worth his time.  “It’s better than standing here, waiting to be shot by the Vels anyway.”



Hiram took the key and the bottle. “Even if they allow you passage Warren, be wary of the Woodfolk. They do not care for us.” He remembered the last time he came across the Woodfolk.  *Tall, angular people smelling like petrichor. The whistle of their terrible stone axes which were thick enough to be clubs, humming through the air. The meaty noise when stone connected with flesh. The wet screams of the Magister initiates falling to the attack, and their panicked chants rising into screams as they hurriedly read the prewritten spell scrolls trying to cast shields despite the loss of their fellows, stumbling over the complicated words, slipping on the hand gestures, collapsing into a gibbering mass of death as Hiram fled.*



Hiram suppressed a shudder, and gripped the bottle tighter by the neck, almost holding it like a club before he caught himself.



William, not noticing his reaction, frowned and stood straighter, locking his eyes with Hiram. “With all due respect, *Magister*, they don’t care for *you.* Us mundanes have no quarrel with them.”



Hiram stared back, his expression blank. The boy would learn one way or another. Willam broke the stare first. “That does not mean they have no quarrel with you for living and working with people like me, though I take your meaning. Still, good luck.” Hiram said, forcing himself to speak with some semblance of joviality. It was wearing to pretend.



“Thank you sir. Good night.” William closed the case he was holding, and looked up at Hiram as if he wanted to say something, but then thinking better of it, turned and walked out.



The long hall at the top of the stairs was dark, lit only by the light spilling in from the open doors of the other rooms. He creaked down the wooden halls, the only noise in the hotel. Normally at this hour he could have expected to hear laughter and conversation from the pub, people in the game room losing and winning miniscule fortunes, and people working the oldest trade. Now? Silence. He unlocked his door, touched the charging rune on the wall, and warm yellow light filled the room bringing false cheer. Hiram sighed and made a complicated gesture with his right hand and the lights dimmed. With nobody around, he felt no compunction to hide what he was, hide his skill.  Hiram shut the door behind him and clicked the lock and deadbolt.  



He opened a cabinet near his bed and took out a fine crystal glass. Working deftly, he removed the cork from the brandy bottle and poured out a healthy measure. He sat at his writing desk and stared at the drink for a moment. He had witnessed the fall of five cities already and he would be damned if he was going to witness a sixth. Bright Lady Protect him, tomorrow it will be all over, one way or another. If he was going to take the train, he would have to get his report out to the Magisterium ahead of him. They needed to know. He took a sip. It really was quite good brandy. He sipped again.



Hiram spent two hours writing. He updated his journal, compiled his report; carefully rolling it up and sealing it with wax. His eyes moved to the thin but strong letter paper he had in his writing kit. Taking a rather large gulp of the brandy, Hiram started a letter home three times before he gave up. No matter what he wrote, it sounded false, unnecessarily upbeat. Who was he trying to soothe after all? Carefully putting his writing kit away, he drank the rest of the brandy in the glass, and poured another large measure.



He reached under his bed and slid out a large leather case. After touching the runes sewn into the seams, the lock clicked and the case popped open. In between leather dividers was a selection of folded silk cloths, almost like bedsheets; a selection of precomposed spells for easy use and re-use. They were mostly for the younger Magisters or those who had a low affinity, but Hiriam always carried some when he was in the field. They had their uses. His hand paused over the sheets for a moment; he could do the spell without one, but he was already exhausted from the day and this was *easier*. His mind automatically went back to the thump of the explosion and he squeezed his eyes shut, trying to not hear it again. He took another gulp of brandy and selected a spell sheet and spread it out on the floor of his room. Block printing on the sheet showed a complicated constellation of runes in blue, red, and black ink. If one stared at it too long, they would start to get a headache, and the sharply printed edges of the printing would blur.



Looking up at the door to make doubly sure the room was locked - William had left, right? He was probably halfway to his death at the hands of the Woodfolk by now -  Hiram tossed back the rest of the brandy in one swallow and stared down at the runes. Pouring his essence into the runes and singing the sacred words, he implored the Bright Lady to let him borrow some of her power. Hiram didn’t like the statue of her at the Magisteriums, she was always shown as much too… beautiful. Tall, long hair, amble bust, it was almost an insult to her. She was power, was light, was the essence that he felt every time he let his concentration slip for just a moment. She wasn’t some pretty, young, waifish woman. The Bright Lady towered over you, intense, and you had to fight to remain standing in her presence. 



As he incanted, there was a sound like a tailor ripping bolts of fabric for use. It was possible to make a cleft large enough to just step through, but that output of energy would be more than enough to alert the Velmarians of his position. A much smaller cleft, barely the size of a dumbwaiter, would have to do. Through it he saw Eleanor, his aide-de-camp seated at a high writing desk. He clicked his stopwatch and called to her. “Elenor, I have a report.”



Elenor practically jumped out of her seat. “Hiram! You’re alive! I heard that the Velmarians-”



Hiram cut her off. “If you heard it from Augury, then they are - once again - mistaken. I swear if they took just one moment to look up from their entrails they would see-” He stopped and his shoulders fell as he realized he was about to commence another rant.  “The Velmarians have not invaded yet. Tomorrow.”



“Why are you risking a cleft now? We know they can detect thaumaturgical energies, you are in danger.” She wrung her hands unconsciously as she spoke. She had always been an office worker, and had never been in the field. She read reports, but it wasn’t the same as seeing things. 



As if to punctuate that statement, there was a large explosion nearby. That was artillery. The shelling had begun. Hiram winced and Elenor’s eyes went wide. “I know, Elenor; this is as small as I could manage, and I’m keeping track of the time open. I am taking the last train out, but the trains are being attacked. I’m not sure that I will survive another day here. I must submit my report before I board. They were able to hold open a cleft large enough to attempt to send their dirigibles through.  More than seven seconds.”



She gasped. “They captured more Magisters.”



Hiram nodded. “Captured or turned yes. They must have at least two dozen. They are coming, this city is lost.” He held up the rolled and sealed report. “Catch” and tossed it through the cleft. As it passed through, he released a breath he didn’t realize he was holding.



Elenor caught the report and looked down at it. Without looking up she said. “Be safe Hiram. I will see you soon. I know this, and you should too. May the Bright Lady smile upon you.”



“And you as well, Elenor.” Hiram broke concentration, and the cleft sealed. He checked his stopwatch. Almost thirty nine seconds. He kept it open far too long. That was more than enough time for a Magister looking for energy spikes to focus on him. He doused the lights and packed up in the dark. He thought he heard thudding footfalls from the rear entrance of the hotel as he made his way downstairs. Probably his imagination, but better to not risk it.



Shouldering his case, Hiram left the hotel, and made his way towards the train station among the noise of artillery and machine gun fire. He had hoped to get one more night’s rest, but it was far too dangerous to remain in one place now. He would have to take his chances walking the city until the train left. Spotlights illuminated the clouds above and the city was unusually bright. His head swimming slightly from the brandy, Hiram pondered the spotlights. They illuminated everything in a yellow white light. He could think of ten different magical ways to achieve the same effect, yet the mundanes have done it all on their own. 



The streets were fortunately deserted this late at night, the residents hiding in cellars and churches; he made it to the station without issue. The artillery noises seemed like they were coming from the other side of the city, so he was relatively safe here for now. If they were coming from the other side, that meant a pincer maneuver. Come the dawn they would strike two sides at once. Hiram looked back at the way he came. No lights, no fire, no screaming, no gigantic clefts open in the sky with dirigibles pouring through; he just might get out of this city after all.



The large station clock - the glass cracked from the previous attack on the train, but still operating - showed that he had more than six hours to wait before the scheduled departure of his train. Standing close, he could hear the ticks of the seconds; a slow cadence. The train - *his* train - was in the station and the locomotive steamed quietly to itself. Railroad workers swarmed over the train, oiling and checking and polishing; some even seemed to be attempting to weld makeshift armor over some of the glass windows. There was a small group of soldiers attempting to bolt a gun on a tripod to the roof of the water car. He briefly thought about offering his services to assist - magic could attach the metal easily - but he was still tired from the cleft. It had taken more out of him than he had thought; maybe the Bright Lady was displeased with him for some reason. If… When he got back, he should visit her shrine and light an offering. He has been lax in his duties to her in these past weeks. He sat on a bench on the platform and watched the workers. Hopefully in a few hours the conductors would allow people to board early.



Now, all he had to do was wait.

Here are the facts: A few years ago, I ran a Call of Cthulhu campaign. My fellow players took on the roles of a psychiatrist and a private detective. My optimal group size is 2-4 players, and at the request of my two players, I set out to find a third member for our group. I placed an ad on a German tabletop gaming site and soon received a reply from Mike, the main character of this story.

Since we didn't know each other yet, we decided to meet for a coffee to check out the vibe. I liked Mike right away. He was open and enthusiastic and an experienced roleplayer. Since I had repeatedly had to deal with problem players in the past, I made it clear that I see TTRPGs as a team effort and that it is important to me and the other players that players and DM work together and everyone has fun. Mike agreed and in turn told a horror story from one of his past games. So everything was fine. Right?

We had a session 0 in which we discussed our expectations and no-gos. The only thing relevant to this story is that we reiterated that we are all in this together, respect each other's time, and play with each other instead of against each other. Everyone agreed. Mike rolled a fortune teller who, through deception and sleight of hand, pretended to have real magical abilities. It was clear that Mike had put a lot of work into this character and was looking forward to sending her on an adventure. (Context: Mike is male but plays a female character. To avoid confusion, I will refer to him as ‘he’ in this story)

Here's where it gets crazy: at the beginning of the campaign, all PCs received a letter from an archaeologist who was considered an eccentric outsider in his field. Each PC was acquainted with him in one way or another. In his letter, he wrote of a major discovery that he, for the time being, only wanted to share with people he trusted. He invited the PCs to his current location, a small town in southern Germany, where he and his fourth associate, an old pastor, would be waiting for them.

The PCs arrived in town by train and the psychiatrist and the detective got to know each other right away. This is where I may have messed up: The PCs knew about each other, but had no other connection to each other. In all my years as DM, this had never been a problem and obviously it wasn't for the psychiatrist and the detective either, but if I had determined that the characters were more familiar with each other in some way at the beginning, the following situation might have been avoided: While the two were talking about the extremely mysterious letter from the archaeologist and discussing what their first step would be, Mike joined them briefly, asked something like ‘are you here because of the archaeologist's letter?’ They both answered in the affirmative, whereupon Mike said, ‘Well, that's good to know. I have to go now.’ And he left. He said (to me as the DM) he wanted to go to the church.

The psychiatrist and the detective set off without Mike's character to check into the hotel where the archaeologist was supposed to be waiting for them, only to discover that he had not been in his room for five days. With clever role-playing and a good dice roll, the detective gained access to the room and discovered a torn-out page of a diary in the trash can. Here the PCs read that he had purchased a copy of an occult book, which is why ""THEY"" were hunting him and had already murdered his friend, the old pastor. More clues were suspected in the pastor's apartment.

Meanwhile Mike arrived at the church office, where he met the new pastor. Mike, not knowing that he had the wrong guy in front of him, tried to find out the whereabouts of the archaeologist. When he finally learned that the old pastor was dead, he said goodbye and started his shopping tour. The first thing he asked me was whether there was a photographer in town. During my preparations for the campaign, I learned that there is actually a photographer in the city in question who has been active since the early 1920s, so I was happy to include him in the adventure. Mike asked the photographer about magnesium and potassium permanganate. I'm not a chemist and only have a slight knowledge of photography, so I asked Mike what he was planning to do. His answer was ‘you'll see’. Not cool, but I let it be. Next, he asked if there was a esoteric shop in town. I wasn't sure if there were such shops in Germany in the 20s, so I asked him again: ‘what exactly are you planning?’ Mike again grinned broadly and replied: ‘you'll see.’ This time I didn't let it go.

Me: ‘Don't you think that as the DM I should know what you're planning?’

Mike: “No.’

Me: ”Why not?’

Mike: “I have a surprise for you.’

Me: ”I hate surprises.’

Short silence.

Me: ‘Listen. I'm the DM. I'm not playing against you. I'm playing with you. We're all on the same team, and if you tell me what you're planning ahead of time, I can do a better job of preparing, which in turn will give you a better chance of success. I can't possibly memorise the entire inventory of every single store, and I have no idea what the properties of every single chemical are. If I know what the end result is that you want, I can prepare something. So, what do you say?’

Mike: ‘Ok. I want to slip the pastor opium and then intimidate him with a light and smoke show to learn what happened to the old parson.

I let Mike do as he pleased. Fortunately, the other two PCs used Mike's shopping trip to talk to the young priest themselves and obtain the keys to his deceased colleague's apartment. Since I wanted to reunite the group, I constructed the scene so that Mike saw the other two PCs coming out of the church office and opening a door across the street. They invited him to search the apartment with them, but Mike declined. While the two were going through the old priest's belongings and discovered a clue about catacombs running under the city, Mike prepared his ‘light and smoke show’.

Long story short, Mike slipped some opium into the priest's wine, lit incense sticks and blinded him with several rounds of flash powder while pretending to be the devil. The pastor was terrified and hid under his desk. Mike's extensive preparations and masterful intimidation check did not change the fact that the pastor knew absolutely nothing about the circumstances of his predecessor's death or the whereabouts of the archaeologist. Realising that he couldn't get any information out of the priest, Mike broke one of the windows with a chair and jumped from the first floor, drawing a thick cloud of smoke behind him and accompanied by the panicked screams of the pastor. Perhaps this is a good opportunity to mention that it was broad daylight and the church was located in the middle of the city centre, in front of a large square where dozens of people were milling around at the time. The crowd screamed and immediately the whistle of a police patrol sounded, loudly ordering Mike to stop. When I saw the look on Mike's face, I suddenly realised what kind of player I had in front of me. Mike must have pulled off such stunts before, and the fact that he was suddenly dealing with the police was probably the first time he had been confronted with the consequences of his actions.

At the time, there was a festival in town and I decided that he had the chance to hide in a group of costumed people. His roll was a success and he got away. Since this was Mike's first adventure with our group, I didn't want to let him rot in jail for the rest of the session. But I hoped that he would take this as a warning shot. It turned out that my expectations would be disappointed.

The psychiatrist and the detective had since found a city guide who told them that there was access to the catacombs under one of the local breweries. Most of the tunnels were not open to the public, but a small part was accessible for guided tours. A little unsure of what to do next, Mike wandered through the streets and I decided that he saw the other two PCs waiting at a bus stop to get to the brewery. Mike turned away from them and walked on. At this point, the psychiatrist's player let out an audible sigh. I asked, ‘Are you sure?’

Mike thought about it for a moment and then finally decided to approach them. He even offered to drive them to the brewery, since he was the only one in the group who had a car. The rest of the adventure, the group worked together. They talked to the old, demented brewmaster, gained access to the catacombs, wandered through the darkness and finally overpowered a cultist who was waiting for them in an altar room (btw the catacombs are an RL place, but there is not a hidden Shrine to a hungry god down there. At least I hope so). Here the PCs found not only the occult book, but also the archaeologist, who was injured, dehydrated, but still alive and tied up in a corner, ready to give the PCs answers to their questions... in the next session.

After the session, we talked about the adventure as a group. We also talked to Mike, and the two players said that they had only accepted the offer of a ride for meta reasons, because they wanted the adventure to continue as a group. I also explained that it was difficult for me to have to lead two adventures at the same time. We told Mike (and we meant it) that we would like to continue playing with him, but that his character should work to gain the group's trust after he had previously constantly avoided them.

Session 2

The detective player brought a friend for the second session. She played a journalist and received a letter similar to the others before the start. The in-game reason why she couldn't participate in the first adventure was that her train just did not arrive on time. The cliché of the punctual German does not apply to public transport.

The adventure more or less started where the last one left off. The PCs took the archaeologist to a hospital. He reported that he had been searching for a long time for a lost temple of an ancient god and had found clues to its location in the occult tome (Of Unspeakable Cults). He asked the PCs to watch the book while he was in the hospital. The PCs were made aware of the book's absolute importance for the rest of the plot. Mike immediately tried to convince the group to let him watch the book. Since the group had absolutely no reason to trust Mike's character, they declined. Mike tried a persuasion roll on the psychiatrist, but I immediately forbade it. So Mike conceded. For now.

The group went to the hotel, where everyone had their own room, prepaid by the archaeologist. The PCs went to bed, but Mike's character stayed up late. Long after midnight, he left his room and crept to the psychiatrist's door. He picked the lock with a lockpick, rummaged through her stuff, took the book and disappeared again. I made Mike roll the dice with every damn step. When he picked the lock, when he crept through the room, when he rummaged through the suitcase and when he left the room again. Mike made every roll. He went in and out like a shadow. The psychiatrist's player sat there with an annoyed expression on her face the whole time. She started to ask ‘why?’ but then stayed in character and held back the question. The journalist's player was visibly confused. Then, instead of going back to his room, he left the hotel and went off in the middle of the night to look for another one. He found a cheap motel, checked in and hid the book behind a radiator. Only then did he went to bed.

The next morning, the PCs minus Mike sat at the breakfast table, explained the events so far to the journalist and planned their next move. Of course, they quickly realised that both Mike and the book had disappeared. Although the players knew what had happened, the PCs suspected that Mike had been kidnapped along with the book, just as the archaeologist had been. They began to discuss how they could free him. I wondered briefly how far the group would go to track down Mike and prepare to rescue him from the clutches of a dangerous cult. I was sure that at least one of the players would see this through to the bitter end. I, however, had had enough. The session had only lasted 20 minutes and I was already forced to improvise a second bullshit adventure because Mike had planned another solo trip. There was no way I was going to let the PCs go on a mini adventure when their players actually knew it was going to be a wild goose chase. So I asked Mike, now in a decidedly sterner tone than in the last session: ‘Why are you doing this after all the conversations we've had before?’

He tried to play dumb at first, but I kept badgering him until he finally uttered the wonderful sentence, ‘That's what my character would do!’

I said ‘great! There's a super easy solution for that!’

Mike: “What's that?’

Me: ”Can't you just play a character who acts less like a selfish asshole and who is interested in working with the rest of the group?’

Mike: “Well... I guess so.’

Me: ”Great! We don't even have to change your character sheet for that. So let's go.’

Mike's character went to the hotel, where he arrived at the breakfast table just in time and told the characters a wild story of cultists who had entered the hotel at night and had stolen the book. He had chased them down, killed them and brought the book back safely. I let him have it.

The rest of the adventure went by with (almost) no further escapades on Mike's part. But of course he tried to make off with the book one more time, to which I simply responded with a brief ‘no.’

At the end of the session, when everyone had left and I was home alone again, I thought long and hard about the last two adventures. At this point in my roleplaying ‘career,’ I had reached a point where my tolerance for problem players was very low. I had already had to deal with all sorts of thatguyisms. I had a creep at the table who just didn't realise that the female players were disgusted by him rather than charmed by his advances. I had several players who were up to two hours late without giving notice. I had players who, even after three years, still didn't have their own rule book and even after all this time still had to ask how to make a simple attack roll. Apart from IRL violence, I've seen just about every kind of nonsense a DM can endure. As a result, I often planned and ran the campaigns out of a twisted sense of duty, rather than because I really enjoyed it. Every time I picked up the pen to work out an NPC or draw a dungeon, I wanted to puke because the only thought in my head was what kind of crap THAT GUY would pull this time. And I'd finally had enough.

The next day, I discussed the situation with the other players, and we all agreed that Mike's BS was going too far and there was no comming back. So I took my phone and sent Mike a voice mail explaining that he was no longer invited to the next session. The reason for this is his constant solo escapades, in which he doesn't seem to give a shit whether the other players are having fun or not. Also, he doesn't seem to be able to get rid of that stupid player-vs-DM mentality.

And that took care of the problem. The journalist fit in wonderfully with the group and we had a year-long campaign that took the PCs from Germany to Austria, from there to Cairo, to the City Without a Name and back to Germany, from where they flew on an airship through a portal to the Otherworld and punched the BBEG in the face with an umbrella.

Dear Mike (which isn't really your name), should you read this: I think you're a great guy. When I had coffee with you, I got really good vibes from you and you definitely put a lot of heart into creating your characters. That's wonderful! But I hope that in the time that has passed since our game, you have learned that you are not the only player in an RPG session and that the other people in the game also want a moment in the spotlight and to enjoy their time at the table.

Wherever you are now, I hope you have found a group where you can have fun and bring just as much fun to your fellow players.",0,1734875349.0,rpghorrorstories,2,0.5,False

Jason Isbell - singer

These two started seeing each other around one year ago. Nothing special people do this all the time. The problem is Jason Isbell filed for divorce but he is still married. Some of his fans were upset because with soon to be ex wife he created many beautiful songs. In the meantime jasonisbellsnark subreddit was created. Few days ago user  claimed to be Anna Weyant posted request  not talk about her, especially about cheating allegetions.
Mod asked her to do something which can convice she really is Anna W. And said ""maybe you could post cup of coffee on your ig story"". Minutes later Anna Weyant posted cup of coffee. People were convinced it is her. After that 20 users were blocked by Jason and Anna. Somehow their reddit activity was linked wirh ig activity. 

People also were confused because why person who is sorrounded by billionares/celebrities is so concern that people on small subreddit are snarking on her looks or voice. Taylor Swift is dealing with it daily. If it comes to Jason allegeldy (acording to his fans) he has history of following his fans/former fans/doxing people.

- amerikanare: älskar småprat. Gillar att berätta var dom kommer ifrån osv, ganska glada. Ibland ger dom tillomed dricks om man har tur. Vissa har svårt att förstå att vi använder kronor här och inte dollar. Helt okej gäng ändå 

-fransmän: blir smått irriterade när de inser att jag inte talar franska. Himlar med ögonen och suckar djupt som att jag är dum i huvudet för att jag inte fattar vad dom babblar om. Får ofta frågan om jag kan franska, de blir lite hoppfulla i början. Min teori är att de tror jag kommer ifrån Västafrika (gör inte det) och där talar många franska. 

- araber: reser dom i stora gäng bråkar dom ofta om notan. Intressant att se. Verkar alltid vara mannen som betalar om det gäller par. 

- andra européer: gillar att dra skämt om hur stressigt det är med svenska kronan då de tänker i euro. ”Höhö one coffee for 30 euros?!?!” 

- Östasiater: Ber om ursäkt om dom inte kan engelska, typ den enda gruppen som plockar efter sig. Skulle säga att de är fransmännens raka motsats.

1hjyt0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1hjyt0n/my_symptoms_that_disappeared_after_carnivore/,My symptoms that disappeared after carnivore…,"Symptoms list is at the bottom… 

Every time I’ve tried discussing carnivore (Lion) diet with doctors, the conversation ends the same way. They ask questions, pretend to be open-minded, and then dismiss everything in a patronizing and superior tone. They give hard hitting one-liners then walk off in a superior way before you can answer. It ruminates in your mind and is infuriating. I decided to stop all conversations on this topic with any doctors because of the impact they were having on my mental health by not letting me respond. It’s fine if they’d discuss and debate (as they claim to), but to give one-liners and walk off or close the door in your face is just infuriating.

Recently, I was at a gathering and a friend of a friend happened to be a doctor & asked me questions. I thought to myself oh no here we go again. Of course he heard about my diet and kept asking questions about it. I kept trying to change topic because I knew what would happen & don’t want to be angry for days. I don’t want to be ruminating and getting angry over an interaction with a doctor again. 

Low stress is key to good health.. 

He kept on asking and wouldn’t leave the topic alone, and convinced me he is open minded. He managed to get my guard down and came across like he’s genuinely interested in having an open chat. But little did I know it was just a ploy to get my guard down- as soon as I showed him my list of symptoms that had disappeared since starting carnivore (lion diet), he became patronising, dismissive, superior, told me all my improvements were due to “stress reduction,” claiming it was just a coincidence that it happened when I started carnivore. No explanation as to why I am suddenly “less stressed” on carnivore after experiencing these symptoms for 40+ years or how that explains the fact it’s repeatable. I tried to answer “I am less stressed because of fewer symptoms, not the other way around”… but before I could respond, he said he doesn’t have time to continue the conversation, walked off in a superior manner & disappeared. 

Meanwhile onlookers were all singing his praises and looking at me like I’m a crazy person, and followed him asking him “are there any studies that show…?” repeatedly like he’s some kind of walking encyclopaedia on research studies just because he’s a doctor. They were treating him like a celebrity & he lapped it up.

Same old same old… I’m so tired of this. This is why I don’t interact with them anymore…

People don’t realise that doctors aren’t trained in critical thinking or how to analyze research studies- that’s the role of research scientists at universities. Yet people mistakenly equate “doctor” with “research scientist”. Doctors are trained to follow treatment protocols, not to question them. GPs, in particular, are trained to gatekeep resources, handle admin, and refer patients to specialists- nothing much more than that. Most doctors rely on treatment scripts without questioning the evidence behind them. 

Whenever I try to explain carnivore to any curious doctor, I just end up pissed off by their superior attitude & by them walking off after a one-liner which they deliver with a well practised patronising manner, so I’ve had to stop interacting for the sake of my mental health. 

One wonders - did they become doctors to heal others or for personal ego? 

It’s not worth the frustration afterward or rumination. 

For anyone interested, here is (partially) my list of my symptoms that disappeared or reduced within 1-2 months carnivore (lion diet):

1. Tourette’s ticks - 70% gone

I just wanted to share my experience going through and recovering from my Bilateral Salpingectomy case anyone is interested in getting it done and curious what the healing is like or if you already have yours scheduled and you are browsing others experiences to prep for yours.

For reference: I'm 36 and have not had any children.
I also live alone and other than having a friend drive me, I didnt really have anyone else around for recovery. 

I'm happy to answer any questions or clarify anything written here!

Day 1
Pre op-
Filled out pretty surgery docs and final payments since my appointment opened very last minute and I had less than a week notice.
Almost peed my pants waiting to take a pregnancy test after my hour long commute.

I went back to the room and got dressed in the gown and had an epic battle with the compression leggings. I had a couple different nurses come by and had me sign some forms. Including one that said I was fully aware this was PERMANENT and not reversible (lol). Every single nurse that came in also made me verbally confirm the name of the procedure I was getting. I'm sure for legal reasons. 

I've seen a lot of people on here say they HAD to take out their jewelry, but they just had me sign a jewelry waiver and I left mine in. (Several earrings and a nose ring that would have required pliers to get off)

My OR nurse came by and walked me through the full procedure and the anesthesiologist also came by to check that I hadn't drank or eaten anything. 

They had me take 2 500mg Tylenols at this time but that was all the pain meds I was given. 

When it was time to go my doctor came back and asked if I had any final questions and if I was ready and I asked if I could keep my IUD for an art project and she said hell yeah. 

They gave me the good good and I remember getting to the OR room and moving to that table and then waking up back in recovery.

Post op

I was awake when they removed my breathing tube so that was awful. The chemical taste of whatever lube they coated it in was horrid and of course, my throat was numbed and sore so swallowing was rough. Drinking water helped. I was back there coming out of the anesthesia for maybe about 15 minutes before we left it was fairly quick. My pain levels of the incisions and actual surgery areas weren’t bad at all; it was around the levels of mild to moderate period cramps. Honestly the worst pain day 1 was my throat soreness. 

I ended up not filling the pain pill script my doctor sent in since it was Hydrocodone and that tends to make me super nauseous and I wasn’t really in much pain so I decided to just go it with OTC meds. I figured I could always go back and get them if things got bad. 

I didn’t have much trapped air but there was a little and it was uncomfortable but not incredibly painful like some people had so I got lucky on that front. It mostly felt like I had a painful burp that I couldn’t get out. 

My friend who drove me dropped me off at home and I spend the rest of the night on the couch with my dogs watching tv.

As the night wore on my abs became increasingly more sore, I assume from having my abdomen inflated with air. Other than that, no pain increase anywhere. The only two things that continued to be a nuisance were my sore throat and the damn compression stockings that they said I needed to wear for 24 hours. I had some light spotting but not much bleeding. I am also on my period this weeks so the spotting could have also been from that. (Fs in the chat for my poor uterus this week)

Luckily I already sleep with a U shaped body pillow so I was set there. Sleeping with something between your legs really helps take some of the pressure off your incisions. 

Day 2

I woke up this morning with about the same levels of pain in my surgery areas. My ab muscles feel significantly more sore today so coughing is a bit more painful but still not unmanageable. My throat feels a little better today but is definitely on the sore side.

Only light spotting today, just a panty liner was sufficient coverage.

VERY over these compression socks and cannot wait to take them off at 3pm. 

Normally I have a morning BM but I haven't had one today. Not sure if it's because I ate very little yesterday or if it is because my muscles down there don't want to strain, but I have been adding laxatives to my coffee and tea to make sure when I do go there will be ZERO straining. 

Since my surgery was scheduled so last minute and I have a ton of work before the end of the year due, I opted to not take time off. I WFH for myself so it wasn't like I had to put in full 8 hours, just needed to meet some deadlines. So I was up and working today For a good 5 hours with no issues. 

Decided to hop in bed early since I was exhausted.

Day 3:

Today was the first day I had a semi-hard time getting out of bed. Not really due to pain, just because I felt exhausted. I also slept significantly later than I normally would have. I probably would have slept longer but my dogs were getting antsy and requesting to be let out.

Overall pain levels are pretty similar. Ab muscles are still sore. My incisions are starting to feel a bit tender for the first time so they must be starting to heal up. I barely noticed them at all the first 2 days. I still feel like I don't need anything more than tylenol.

Still just spotting, still only need a panty liner.

I did absolutely overexert myself today and should have had a bit more chill. I went out to lunch with my book club, then went to the grocery store to pick up supplies to make Christmas cookies, and then got started on a couple of the doughs that require overnight chilling. It was a bit too much for day 3 post-op and I'm definitely feeling it right now. Bless the healing power of this heating pad. 

Day 4

I woke up with significantly less pain overall today and felt mostly normal. Just a little more tired than usual.

I found that I was having heavier spotting today, but I'm not sure if that was because of this being my period week or from the procedure. It didn't really look like menstrual blood so I'm assuming the latter. 

Day 5 and beyond

I'm feeling back to normal. No real pain unless something presses directly against my incisions. Still some mild spotting but looking more like menstrual blood now.

Overall a very easy procedure and healing and very doable without any assistance!

I'm happy to answer any questions if anyone is curious about any part.

YSL MYSLF EDP

Montblanc Individuel

Versace Eros EDT

D&G The One EDT

JPG Le Male Elixir

Dior Sauvage EDP

YSL Y EDP

Bvlgari MIB EDP

Versace Eros Energy EDP

Tom Ford Noir EDP

Rasasi Hawas EDP

Here is what I think of them:

MYSLF EDP: 8.5/10
Mom got this for dad for his bday and it's a beautifully sweet fragrance which doesn't overdo it like the Le Male Elixir. Lasts about 8 hours on clothes and not so much on skin. More of a winter fragrance but I imagine you could pull this off in a semi formal setting anytime.

Montblanc Individuel: 6/10
Not much to notice here. Its synthetically sweet and spicy and I don't know why but with this fragrance, I like it when it is on but I don't willingly reach for it. It is very loud however for an EDT with projection of about 4 feet I would say. Longeivity is ok, 4-5 hours max. It's my dad's signature scent, I personally am not a huge fan.

Versace Eros EDT: 9/10
I definitely prefer this to the EDP, The EDP felt like my nose glitched. Rich and smooth fragrance with decent loudness and longeivity. Never really noticed either of those factors but friends notice it and they like it a lot. Will definitely get a larger bottle once this one runs out.

D&G The One EDT: 8.5/10
One of the better EDTs in my opinion and the best ine of it's kind. Again, prefer this to the EDP, the EDP was too spicy for me. Love how the Leather in this blends perfectly with the Sandalwood. Both of which compliment each other rather than dominate. It's almost like a constant power struggle between the two and the result is amazing. If you have a bottle of MIB, Use this with that. Its blissful.

JPG Le Male Elixir: 8/10
My god this is so strong. It's so strong I am sure I lose my capability to do math or anything that requires critical thinking. It's very sweet and chocolatey, its like overdosing on what a coffee shop smells like. It's better in winters

Sauvage EDP: 9/10
Still amazing though it sort of doesn't smell like what it used to nowadays. I notice a slight note of musk now. It isnt bad but I would prefer it not be there.

YSL Y EDP: 9/10
This is the safest fragrance out there. Simple, fresh and lasts decent as well. more of a summer fragrance in my opinion. If I had to pick one fragrance to use everyday, it would be this one.

Bvlgari MIB: 8.5/10
Really rich, seductive and complex, this one. Wouldn't recommend wearing this everyday but can definitely be pulled off for a party or something. Its tobacco and leather notes are very much present also with a hint of iris. It's amazing by itself but could be better if it was slightly sweeter.

Versace Eros Energy: 8/10
Citrus. That's basically it. Doesn't mean its bad, it's pleasant. There is also a slight note of Vanilla which is more prominent from a distance. Performance is ok, nothing special. Projection is not wild, more like 1-2 feet max.

Tom Ford Noir: 10/10
This is Bruce Wayne in a bottle. Amazingly Sophisticated and Rich smelling. I preferred this to the extreme. The most prominent note on this one is that of Powder and slight Mint. It's slightly similar to the MIB the way both of them are slightly bitter smelling. Words won't do this justice, I highly recommend getting a sampler of this one before committing to the full bottle. I paid about 13k for 100ml from sephora but scentoria has it for way cheaper.

Rasasi Hawas: 6/10
This was a gift from my brother. It's very highly synthetic in my opinion and its hard to focus on the bubblegum scent everybody speaks of. It has been macerating for about 2 months now, it has gotten better but still not the best. I think we got an amazing deal on this one but I probably won't buy this again.

I am eyeing the Jazz Club, Sauvage Elixir, Oud Ispahan and Neroli Portofino next. Drop some reviews if you have them, looking forward to reading them. Cheers 🥂",18,1734874705.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,3,0.95,False

1hjymep,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hjymep/aitah_for_not_wanting_my_ex_to_hook_up_with_her/,AITAH for not wanting my Ex to hook up with her abusive Ex?,"Okay, so my (32NB) ex (30F) and I broke up in May after 2 years of dating. Not long after we started dating she started working with me on my small business that I've run for almost 4 years. In that time I have basically given her equity and despite the short comings of our romantic relationship have come to see her as an incredibly valued friend and business partner.

Regarding why we broke up, there are a handful of contributing factors, mostly just springing from the fact that we moved in together way too soon and that we have a major difference in lifestyles and a fundamental difference in love languages and how we show the other love vs how we need to be shown love. When we split it was a generally amicable breakup, and we have continued running the business together and being generally important people in each other's lives since then. I still invite her to my family's holidays because she and my family always connected(honestly to some degree more than she and I did) and because she is kind of estranged from her family due to her mom's husband being an abusive piece of shit.

A pretty constant source of conflict when we were dating though was her relationship with her ex(34M). About 2 months after we started dating the abuse she was dealing with from her stepdad was getting to be too much, so she decided to move out of their house(a house she purchased for them all to live in together). At the time she moved in with her ex who she had broken up with less than a year before. When she first told me she said it was because she wanted to buy her own house in 6 months and didn't want to have to sign a 1 year lease anywhere, and because he owned a nice townhouse in a neighborhood she liked and would rent her a room relatively cheaply. I told her I didn't mind her living situation as long as she could promise me that there weren't any lingering emotional hang ups on either side(they broke up because she really wanted children and he had no desire to have kids). She assured me that she didn't have any lingering feelings, which I believed and still believe to this day. The issue was that it became pretty apparent that this guy DID have lingering feelings towards her. 

Literally the week she moved in she texted him saying ""hey, what are you doing this weekend? My partner wants to come cook us dinner so they can get to know you(I'm a chef)"" and he responded with ""I'm not about to be cucked in my own home by my most recent girlfriend and the guy she's dating."" From that point he took every opportunity to let me and her know that he still considered her ""his property."" He was regularly wildly aggressive and toxic to me, to her friends, and to a much lesser extent her.

They lived together for almost a year, and towards the end of that year he let up on the aggression a little bit, but never apologized for the way that he acted towards me. I am a generally very anxious person and I have a lot of insecurities, but the whole time they lived together my Ex assured me that she had absolutely no romantic or sexual interest in this guy whatsoever, despite his clear feelings of ownership over her. There were repeated incidents of him being weirdly aggressive and controlling towards her, and she would regularly say ""I can't wait until we move in together because I cant handle this dude's bs anymore."" Despite this they would hang out all the time, and go do things that to me generally felt like romantic activities(seeing late night movies, getting dinner at romantically lit restaurants and drinks at fancy bars).

 When I confronted her about that she said it was because she wanted to remain amicable and didn't want a tense living situation. She assured me that nothing was happening between them sexually or whatever, and I believed her even though it was a weekly, daily, hourly source of fear and anxiety for me. I didn't want my insecurities to damage our relationship so when she said she had absolutely no interest in this guy, romantic or sexual, I believed her. She said repeatedly, when she moves out of his place neither of us will have to deal with him being a presence in our lives anymore.

Fast forward to month 10 of them living together, we had finally found a place we could move in together, we signed the paperwork, and we were in the process of moving all her stuff out. When we were carrying stuff down her stairwell she said something about not missing the uneven steps or something and I said ""well luckily you will never have to be here again after this week"" and she got really weird and tight lipped and said ""I mean, I might come by for a visit"" or something like that, which just gutted me. Like why would you come visit a guy that clearly saw you as his property? A guy that took every opportunity that he could to shit on the most important relationship in your life? That started a really long argument between us and after days of contention I said ""okay, whatever, if you have to keep being friends with this guy I understand, but can you stop doing things that are so date-coded with him?? Like why can't y'all just go grab a coffee in the afternoon or go to trivia or the park or something?"" And she said she understood, and that she wouldn't go out to dinner with him or get late night drinks anymore.

Literally less than a month after us moving into our own place I found out she had asked him to go get dinner at Restaurant Iris, a really expensive and romantic restaurant that just happened to be ""the restaurant closest to the place they lived"" and I just blew up. Her asking him to do that after she promised me that she wouldn't was just devastating. We argued about it for weeks and I told her that it felt like she was constantly choosing this ""friendship"" over our lives together and our romantic relationship.

Her ""friendship"" with this dude was a constant source of conflict in our relationship from that point onward. She would assure me that she wanted nothing to do with him, then I would find that they had been texting and she would say ""he was there for me at a really difficult point in my life, I can't just throw this friendship away."" But like, I was ALSO there for her during that difficult time, and so were many people that also weren't clearly trying to fuck her. Every single time she would assure me that there was nothing romantic or sexual going on. Eventually the constant arguments over their relationship, and arguments over our shared living space got to the point where we couldn't handle them any more and we broke up.

Honestly, since we broke up our relationship has been better than ever. We don't argue hardly at all any more, we run our businessess efficiently, and we even hang out as friends pretty regularly. We have both been dating other people in various capacities since our breakup, and have encouraged each other to go and find true happiness where we can.

The issue I have come to today, that is making me rethink everything about our past and our friendship, is that this ex who she hasn't talked to since just after we broke up because she went to hang out with him and he put the moves on her and she just left because it ""made her uncomfortable"" just moved to a really beautiful mountain town on the other side of the state, and she has been talking about how she wanted to be in the mountains for her birthday that's coming up in a few weeks.

Yesterday she told me that she was thinking of going and visiting him because she wanted to see the mountains, and it immediately made my stomach churn. I said ""what are you going to do if he tries to hook up with you again?"" She said she didn't know. I probed a bit more and asked ""I mean, how did he respond when you told him you wouldn't be hooking up with him if you came to visit?"" And she got really quiet. I asked a few more questions and she finally said ""I would be lying if I said I wasn't interested in hooking up with him."" After literally years of her saying she had no interest in this guy. After her saying ""even if we weren't together I wouldn't want to hook up with this man, because I don't have any attraction to him at all."" 

That just devastated me. It felt like every time she reassured me, or promised me that there was nothing going on between them the entire time we were together was a lie. It felt like honestly the majority of our relationship was built on a lie. I told her if there was any reality where she would hook up with this guy after everything that he put me and her through that I have no interest in maintaining a friendship or working relationship with her, and she is acting like I am being a controlling piece of shit because of my response.

Is my response unwarranted? I have no problem with her hooking up with whoever she wants to hook up with, or doing whatever she wants to do, but if feels like her being with this guy is just a betrayal of everything she assured me of in our relationship.",1,1734874593.0,AITAH,4,0.67,False

---------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for life, but many people struggle to understand exactly how much they should drink every day. Staying properly hydrated impacts your health, energy levels, and overall well-being. This guide will help you learn about daily water intake and its benefits.

### How Much Water Should You Drink?

The amount of water you should drink daily varies based on several factors. The general recommendation is to drink about 8 to 10 cups (2 to 2.5 liters) of water each day. However, this can change depending on:

- **Age and Gender:** Men typically need more water than women due to a larger body mass, while older adults may require more to compensate for decreased thirst perception.
- **Activity Level:** If you exercise or engage in physical activities, you'll need more water to replace fluids lost through sweat.
- **Climate:** Hot or humid weather increases your risk of dehydration, requiring you to drink more water.
- **Health Status:** Certain conditions, like fever or gastrointestinal issues, can raise your hydration needs.
- **Diet:** Foods high in water content, such as fruits and vegetables, can contribute to your daily intake.

### Simple Guidelines for Daily Water Intake

Here are some straightforward tips to help you determine how much water you should consume daily:

- Use the **8x8 rule**: Drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day.
- Listen to your body: Drink when you feel thirsty and keep an eye out for signs of dehydration.
- Monitor urine color: Pale yellow urine often indicates good hydration, while dark urine may suggest you need more fluids.
- Consider your activity: Increase fluid intake before, during, and after exercising or engaging in strenuous activities.

### Benefits of Staying Hydrated

Maintaining proper hydration is crucial for your health, and here are some of the benefits you can experience when you drink enough water:

- **Improved Physical Performance:** Adequate hydration boosts strength, power, and endurance during exercise, helping you feel more energetic.
- **Enhanced Mental Clarity:** Staying hydrated improves focus, concentration, and cognitive function, allowing you to think more clearly.
- **Better Digestion:** Drinking enough water aids in digestion and helps prevent constipation by keeping your digestive system running smoothly.
- **Healthy Skin:** Hydration promotes healthy skin by maintaining its elasticity, reducing dryness, and helping to diminish the appearance of wrinkles.
- **Weight Management:** Sometimes, your body misinterprets thirst as hunger. Drinking water can curb unnecessary snacking, supporting your weight management goals.

### When and How to Drink Water

To make hydration a habit, try these practical tips:

- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Always have a reusable water bottle with you, making it easy to drink throughout the day.
- **Set Reminders:** Consider setting alarms or using apps to remind you to drink water at regular intervals.
- **Infuse Your Water:** If plain water doesn't excite you, add slices of fruits, herbs, or cucumber to enhance the flavor.

Understanding how much water you should drink daily is essential for maintaining your health and vitality. Factors like age, activity level, and climate all play a role in your hydration needs. By following the general recommendations, listening to your body, and making hydration a daily practice, you can enjoy the many benefits that come from staying well-hydrated.

Take control of your hydration today, and discover how a simple habit can transform your health and well-being.

The Science Behind Hydration and Its Importance
-----------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is essential for your health and well-being. Yet, many people overlook the importance of drinking enough water daily. Let's dive into the science behind hydration and understand why it matters.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Understanding Hydration

Hydration refers to the process of maintaining an adequate level of water in your body. Water plays a critical role in various bodily functions, including:

- Regulating body temperature
- Transporting nutrients
- Removing waste
- Maintaining joint lubrication
- Supporting cellular processes

Your body is composed of about 60% water, which highlights the significance of hydrating properly. When you drink fluids, it is absorbed into your bloodstream and delivered to your cells, ensuring everything runs smoothly.

### The Role of Electrolytes

Hydration isn’t just about drinking water; it also involves electrolytes. Electrolytes are minerals found in your body fluids, such as:

- Sodium
- Potassium
- Magnesium
- Calcium

These minerals help to regulate nerve function and maintain fluid balance. When you sweat, you lose both water and electrolytes, making it essential to replenish them through food or sports drinks, especially during intense physical activities.

### Why You Need to Stay Hydrated

Dehydration can lead to serious health issues, impacting everything from energy levels to cognitive function. Here are some negative effects of inadequate hydration:

- **Fatigue:** Even mild dehydration can sap your energy, leaving you feeling tired.
- **Dry skin:** Lack of water can dry out your skin, making it less elastic and more prone to irritation.
- **Headaches:** Many people find that dehydration is a common trigger for headaches.
- **Cognitive issues:** Difficulty concentrating can arise from being even slightly dehydrated.
- **Digestive problems:** The digestive system relies on water to process food properly.

### How Much Water Should You Drink?

The amount of water you need can vary based on multiple factors such as age, sex, physical activity level, and overall health. Here’s a general guideline:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Adult men: About 3.7 liters (or 13 cups) per day, including all beverages and foods
- Adult women: About 2.7 liters (or 9 cups) per day

Keep in mind that individual needs may vary. For instance, if you are physically active or live in a hot climate, you may need to drink more. Listening to your body’s signals—like thirst and urine color—can guide you in maintaining proper hydration.

### Signs of Dehydration

Being aware of dehydration warning signs can help you take action. Common signs include:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Increased thirst
- Dark yellow urine
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Dry mouth and bad breath
- Cramping in the muscles

If you notice these symptoms, it’s critical to drink water or hydrate with electrolyte-rich fluids.

### Benefits of Staying Hydrated

Proper hydration offers numerous benefits for your overall health:

- **Improved physical performance:** Well-hydrated muscles perform better and recover faster.
- **Enhanced cognitive function:** Staying hydrated supports clear thinking and better concentration.
- **Healthy skin:** Hydrated skin appears more youthful and radiant.
- **Weight management:** Drinking water can help you feel full, reducing overall calorie intake.
- **Efficient kidney function:** Adequate water intake helps flush out toxins and waste.

Hydration into your daily routine is simple. Consider carrying a reusable water bottle, setting reminders to drink water, or adding hydrating foods like fruits and vegetables to your diet. By prioritizing hydration, you take a vital step toward maintaining your health and enhancing your quality of life.

Common Myths About Water Consumption
------------------------------------

Water is essential for life, yet there are many misconceptions about how much we should drink daily. Let's explore the common myths surrounding water consumption to help you stay informed and healthy.

### Myth 1: You Must Drink Eight Glasses of Water Daily

One of the most prevalent myths is that everyone should drink eight glasses of water a day. While hydration is crucial, your actual needs depend on various factors such as your age, gender, activity level, and overall health. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine suggest that men should aim for about 3.7 liters (or 13 cups) of total water per day and women for 2.7 liters (or 9 cups), which includes all beverages and food. It's essential to listen to your body's thirst signals and adjust accordingly.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 2: Thirst Is a Reliable Indicator of Hydration

Many people believe that feeling thirsty means they are dehydrated and should drink more water. While thirst can be a sign that your body needs fluids, it’s not always an accurate indicator. Some individuals, especially older adults, may not feel thirsty even when they are dehydrated. To ensure you're drinking enough, pay attention to the color of your urine; pale yellow indicates good hydration, while dark yellow suggests you need more fluids.

### Myth 3: All Beverages Hydrate You Equally

Another common belief is that any fluid you consume counts equally toward hydration. However, not all beverages are created equal. While water is the best choice for hydration, sugary drinks, caffeine, and alcohol can lead to dehydration. Caffeine and alcohol are diuretics, meaning they can cause your body to lose more water than is consumed. Here’s a quick breakdown:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Water:** Best for hydration.
- **Soft drinks:** High in sugar and can lead to dehydration.
- **Coffee and tea:** May contribute to hydration but consume in moderation.
- **Alcohol:** Can increase fluid loss and should be limited.

### Myth 4: You Can Drink Too Much Water

While staying hydrated is essential, it's also possible to have too much of a good thing. Water intoxication, also known as hyponatremia, occurs when the balance of electrolytes in your body is disrupted by an excessive intake of water. This can lead to dangerous medical conditions. It’s rare and usually only occurs in extreme situations, such as endurance sports or excessive fluid consumption in a short period. Remember, moderation is key.

### Myth 5: You Don’t Need to Drink Water If You Eat Fruits and Vegetables

Fruits and vegetables do contain water, and consuming them can contribute to your overall fluid intake. However, relying solely on them for hydration is not advisable. Foods can supplement your water needs but don’t satisfy the requirement entirely. Aim to drink water regularly throughout the day, even if you include hydrating foods in your diet.

### Myth 6: Drinking Water Can Help You Lose Weight

While staying hydrated is important for overall health, drinking water alone doesn't directly lead to weight loss. However, it can help in weight management when combined with a healthy diet and exercise. Drinking water before meals might make you feel fuller, which can reduce calorie intake. But simply increasing your water intake won't lead to significant weight loss on its own.

### Myth 7: Cold Water Is Bad for Digestion

Another myth suggests that drinking cold water can interfere with digestion. This idea is steeped in cultural beliefs, but scientifically, cold water does not affect digestion in a negative way. Your body regulates the temperature of the water you consume, and drinking cold water can actually aid digestion by improving hydration. The temperature of water is more a matter of personal preference than a health concern.

### Myth 8: You Need to Drink Water Before You're Thirsty

While it’s beneficial to stay hydrated, this doesn't mean you need to preemptively drink water constantly. Drinking through the day is essential, but don’t force yourself to drink beyond what you need. Most people will naturally maintain their hydration levels by drinking fluids as they feel thirsty, which makes listening to your body crucial.

Understanding these myths about water consumption can help you make informed choices about your hydration. Remember to listen to your body, adjust your intake based on your lifestyle, and always aim for balance. Staying well-hydrated is a vital foundation for good health!

Signs of Dehydration: What to Look For
--------------------------------------

Being aware of the signs of dehydration is essential for your health and well-being. Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluids than it takes in. This imbalance can lead to a range of symptoms, some mild and others potentially serious. By recognizing these signs early, you can take steps to rehydrate and keep your body functioning optimally.

### Common Signs of Dehydration

You might not realize you're dehydrated until you notice some subtle indicators. Here’s what you should look for:

- **Thirst:** This is the body’s first signal that it needs more water. If you feel thirsty, it’s a sign you should drink fluids.
- **Dry Mouth and Throat:** A lack of moisture in your mouth and throat can indicate dehydration. You might also notice difficulty swallowing.
- **Dark Yellow Urine:** When you’re well-hydrated, your urine should be light yellow. Dark yellow or amber colors typically indicate that you need to drink more water.
- **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired or lethargic can be a sign your body isn’t getting enough fluids.
- **Dizziness or Lightheadedness:** When you stand up, if you feel dizzy or weak, it might be related to low fluid levels in your body.
- **Headaches:** Dehydration can lead to headaches or migraines for some individuals. Drinking water often helps relieve these symptoms.
- **Dry Skin:** Skin that seems less elastic or shows signs of dryness can indicate a lack of hydration.

### Advanced Symptoms to Monitor

If dehydration persists, more serious symptoms may arise. Recognizing these can help you seek medical attention if necessary:

- **Rapid Heartbeat:** A fast heart rate can be a sign that your body is struggling due to low fluid levels, causing strain on your cardiovascular system.
- **Low Blood Pressure:** If you experience a drop in blood pressure, this could indicate severe dehydration.
- **Confusion:** Serious dehydration can affect your mental state, resulting in confusion or irritability.
- **Fainting:** In extreme cases, dehydration can lead to fainting due to insufficient blood flow to the brain.

### At-Risk Groups

While dehydration can affect anyone, certain groups may be at higher risk:

- **Children:** They can be more susceptible to dehydration due to their smaller size and high levels of activity.
- **Older Adults:** As people age, their sense of thirst may diminish, making them more vulnerable to dehydration.
- **People with Chronic Illnesses:** Conditions like diabetes can lead to increased fluid loss, increasing the risk of dehydration.

### Prevention and Immediate Actions

Prevention is always better than a cure. Here are practical steps you can take to avoid dehydration:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Drink Plenty of Fluids:** Make it a habit to drink water throughout the day, especially during activities and warm weather.
- **Eat Water-Rich Foods:** Foods like fruits and vegetables have high water content and can contribute to your hydration.
- **Avoid Excessive Caffeine and Alcohol:** These beverages can lead to fluid loss, so consume them in moderation.
- **Listen to Your Body:** Pay attention to thirst signals and act on them promptly.

If you suspect that you or someone else is experiencing dehydration, it’s crucial to take action quickly. Drink water or an electrolyte-rich beverage to replenish lost fluids. In severe cases, seek medical attention immediately.

Monitoring for signs of dehydration can be a straightforward way to boost your overall health. Staying hydrated means you’ll feel better, think clearer, and perform better in daily activities. Remember that being proactive about hydration is key to avoiding discomfort and potential health complications.

Tips for Staying Hydrated Throughout the Day
--------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is crucial for your overall health and well-being. Many people struggle with drinking enough water throughout the day. Let’s explore some effective strategies to help you maintain proper hydration levels.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Set a Daily Goal

One of the first steps to staying hydrated is setting a clear daily water intake goal. A common recommendation is to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water, known as the ""8x8 rule."" This equals about 2 liters or half a gallon. However, the right amount can vary based on factors like your age, weight, activity level, and climate. Consider using an online hydration calculator to find a personalized recommendation.

### Carry a Water Bottle

Having a water bottle with you throughout the day can serve as a constant reminder to drink more. Choose a bottle that you like and that’s easy to carry. Fill it up in the morning and keep it within reach whether you're at work, at home, or on the go. Refill your bottle regularly so that you can track your intake.

### Use Reminders and Alerts

In our busy lives, it’s easy to forget to drink water. Set reminders on your phone or use hydration apps that send you notifications to take a sip. Apps like MyWater, WaterMinder, or Plant Nanny not only remind you but also help log your consumption. Regular alerts can help you develop a habit of drinking water consistently.

### Infuse Your Water

If plain water doesn't excite you, try infusing it with various fruits, vegetables, or herbs. Some delicious combinations include:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Strawberries and mint
- Cucumber and lemon
- Orange and rosemary
- Watermelon and basil

This not only adds flavor but may also encourage you to drink more while providing additional vitamins and minerals.

### Eat Water-Rich Foods

Foods that have high water content can also help with hydration. Some excellent options include:

- Watermelon
- Cucumbers
- Oranges
- Strawberries
- Broccoli

These foods can supplement your water intake and provide essential nutrients, making hydration more enjoyable.

### Drink Before Meals

A simple strategy to remember to drink more water is to have a glass before each meal. This practice not only helps with hydration but can also support digestion and control your appetite. Drinking water before meals can make you feel fuller, potentially reducing overeating.

### Monitor Your Urine Color

Keep an eye on the color of your urine as a gauge for hydration. Pale yellow urine typically indicates adequate hydration, while dark yellow or amber signals dehydration. This simple check can help you adjust your fluid intake throughout the day.

### Make It a Habit

Water breaks into your daily routine can help create a lasting habit. Try to drink a glass of water at specific points in your day, such as:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- After waking up
- Before each meal
- Before and after exercising
- Before going to bed

By associating your water intake with daily activities, you make it easier to remember to hydrate.

### Choose Sparkling or Flavored Water

If you prefer a bit of fizz, don’t hesitate to choose sparkling water as an alternative. Some brands offer flavored sparkling waters without added sugars, making them a tasty way to stay hydrated. Just make sure they don't contain artificial sweeteners, which can have adverse effects on your health.

### Track Your Progress

Consider keeping a daily hydration journal or using a hydration app. Logging your daily intake can provide motivation and help you stay accountable. This way, you can also identify patterns in your drinking habits and adjust as needed.

These tips into your daily routine can help you achieve proper hydration, boosting your overall health and well-being. Remember, staying hydrated doesn't have to be a chore. By using creative approaches and reminders, you can make drinking water a simple and enjoyable part of your day!

### Conclusion

Staying properly hydrated is essential for your overall health and well-being. By understanding how much water you should drink daily, you empower yourself to make informed choices that enhance your vitality. The science behind hydration reveals how crucial water is to every bodily function, from regulating temperature to aiding digestion and boosting your mood.

So, I'm a 27M and I'm getting engaged to a 24F. This was arranged by our families, and I met her and really liked her personality and everything. We even went on a small trip together for a day.

The thing is, she had an ex in 12th grade. It lasted only 2-3 months, and I don't mind it much. However, she has a best friend who she’s known since 11th grade. They are really close and talk on calls frequently. She has also helped him with his relationships, and he has done the same for her. They've been best friends for 5 years, and both of them have a lot of trauma, I believe.

They went for coffee last month, and she told me that he's just a friend and that they don’t have feelings for each other. In their chats, he literally told her, 'Your voice gives me peace, talking to you is everything.' He calls her 'cutie,' 'madam ji,' etc., and they exchange good morning and good night messages daily.

I once asked him about it, and he assured me that she's just a friend. I told him to make some distance from her, but she found out and got angry with me, calling me 'controlling.' She also said that her best friend still loves his ex and doesn’t feel the same way about her, so they are just friends.

She even sent him a reel about 'people confusing their friendship for a relationship.'

They do the daily I miss you messages etc. 
She vents to him, he gifts her chocolates on her birthday, he vents about how he misses her ex. 

She’s a good person, and I trust her a lot, but I'm unsure about how I should handle this situation.

Now that we're on X-mas break, and I see that he's sleeping an insane amount. Slept 12 hours Frid night and then another 3 hours the next day. The doctor said she hasn't seen sleepiness as a side effect and I see that it's not listed as and major one for Enlyte.

I was trying to set up SSL certificates for two domains using Nginx Proxy Manager. As soon as I added SSL for the second domain, everything went downhill.

 The main site broke, connections were refused, and Proxy Manager kept throwing errors about missing certificates. To be honest, I only have basic knowledge of servers. My developer, who usually handles this, is currently ill, so I tried to take things into my own hands to get a client’s site live. Big mistake—it’s a total mess now. I’ve spent hours troubleshooting, checking symbolic links, DNS records, Docker logs, and more, but I feel like I’m just poking in the dark.

Quickly we were friends. My husband and I,  and he and his husband. We’re  Aussie but the husband was from Europe. During Covid we were lockdown buddies, dinner parties and drinks, lots of fun and socialising. A holiday to Bali in 2018 for us 4. In 2022, the husband died of a likely Covid related illness. It was unexpected and shocking. I rallied and organised weekly dinner with him. Closed ranks. Support beyond. Since then his life has changed. His grief has changed and he has been really concerning. I got a major pro trump rant at dinner. He’s political alliances was always “the greens” but he’s been horrible because I’m a teal independent (google aus politics), and he’s been quite awfully threatening and the pro trump rant was a surprise. So since mid year he’s gone very silent. Declined invites, been quiet and blocked me on FB when I mentioned his husbands anniversary. Then I get an email from his deceased husbands dad saying a lot of things including that he inherited money but not the house which went to the European parents and he decided not to evict so he didn’t make him homeless and gifted him the ubut he wants me to know he was kicked out last Christmas (I was told the visit didn’t work out). Today he asked me to coffee. He’s ended the friendship. I’m the issue. Apparently I’m me, and I have drama and I’m best off with not seeing him anymore.

Wherever you were supposed to be, you made a wrong turn. You visually assessed the location as a library of infinity. There was an infinitely spiraling staircase and a circle of bookshelves that rose infinitely as well. In the middle of this chaos, a child was sitting at a receptionist's desk. He looked up from the book that he was reading with surprise. 

> **[You have met [Archivist]]**

“Ah, I haven’t seen anybody here in.. ever! Wow, welcome to this archive of knowledge! You must be awfully curious about this place, or you may already know. Regardless, this is the location where my master keeps his jumpers.” Archivist says with an innocent smile. “Of course, you may be wondering where exactly he keeps his jumpers since this is only a library! The Jumpers.. are the books.” 

“Yes, yes! Think of it like Kim-Gongja and the Librarian Constellation concept! You’ve been given special permission by my master to view his creations and speak with them. I shall warn you that they all take place in different locations.” The Archivist snaps his fingers as several books shine and show their covers toward the audience. 


[ - ]


This book had a certain organization’s logo embedded onto the cover of the page. It had the words ‘Secure, Contain, Protect’ under it, with the spine having the title. 

‘Vanguard.’

As you enter this book, you see a nearly empty, meta-physical bar that exists only in conceptual theory. There was an ashtray for cigarettes and cigars, as well as a plethora of drinks shelved. 

> **[You have met [The Administrator]]**

However, a redacted figure with a lovely green coat was the only existence within. He sips a wine glass as he greets you in a friendly manner. “Greetings, it’s been such a long time since I’ve seen other jumpers. I’m the former Administrator of an SCP Foundation from a collapsed reality and current Administrator of Vanguard.” He waves hello. 

“I’ve been in this bar whilst waiting for great changes. My new and former organization has collapsed so.. I’m sorta alone in this bar. I have plenty of stories to tell, and I’m one of the most eloquent of the jumpers around this library.” He tries not to bring the others down with that comment, though. “Well, my time is up. Goodbye, and I hope you pick me.” He nods and waves you goodbye.

“And don’t let those Interdimensional IRS fucks get their hands on you.” He smirks at his last comment before you exit into another book.


[ - ]


This book had a similar texture to the Necronomicon. The texture felt familiar, like human flesh. There was a permanently horrified face etched into the cover. The spine had the words, ‘Avatar of The End’

The location had taken the appearance of a crummy apartment. There was a bit of a mess everywhere, a mattress on the floor, a desk with an overly expensive PC.

> **[You have met [Bastard]]**

“O-oh! Hello..” A black-haired teenager in a blue tracksuit said as he scratched his cheek. “I-I’m rather shy when meeting new people. You can call me.. uh.. “Bastard” since that’s what my parents called me.” He scratched the back of his head. He scratched at his bruised neck a bit. “Anyways, t-try not to let the cosmic horrors bite.” 

“Pick me if you want! I’ll be able to tell you plenty of fun!” He says with a smile before he lets you go on. 


[ - ]


And one final book, constantly shifting, constantly glitching. It felt like there was a new cover every 5 seconds and yet the spine title remained the same. 

‘Des’s Reality.’

You appear inside a Cafè with all the necessary equipment and furniture to become a Starbucks. However, the theme was that of a small coffee shop in the middle of the city. 

> **~~[You have met [Descension]]~~**

“Agh, fuck off.” Des waved away the notification with some annoyance. It was clear that he was able to interact with the metaphysical pop-up with ease.

You could see a white-haired and cerulean-eyed adult running the shop. He was an exact replica of Gojo Satoru.

“Sup. I have no idea why you’re here, but I don’t really mind some customers coming along.” He shrugged. “I’m Descension, a friendly neighborhood reality-bender of existential scale.” He shrugged. “Sorta like the azathoth-like entity above me.” He was clearly referring to ‘Bastard’ using some narrative-level awareness.

“Stay if you want or get the fuck out. I only serve beverages to those with manners and I can refuse service to whomever.” As soon as he said those lines, you got kicked out of the book.

“Hey, friendly tip. Try to avoid that 𝐌𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐭 creep.”

Archivist had closed all of the books, and they flew back to their respective places in the library. “Also, there’s supposed to be a fourth book… but I  personally wouldn’t mention them to the others.

1hjxr13,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hjxr13/not_a_fun_birthday/,Not a fun birthday,"My birthday was last Friday. I spent the last couple weeks letting my wife now I was taking the day off for my birthday. Friday comes, I go to the bathroom and I get “Why are you still here? Are you not going in to work today?” I said I told you I was taking the day off. Her response, “that’s weird!” Great start to the day. I get back in bed and try to snuggle and initiate and get very nastily rejected. Same as any other day. 

At this point, I’m going to ride it out and see how long before she realizes it’s my birthday. “Hey Hon? Do you still have that bookstore gift card my sister gave you last year for your birthday? I want to get one of my best friends a birthday present! Her birthday is tomorrow!” Oh! Ok. Sure! Here’s the card! I get up and make her some coffee and bring it to her in bed and the proceed to make breakfast, all the while listening to “I don’t know why you took the day off… we need the money… are you just going to sit around all day?” 

Noon rolls around and my wife goes into our teenage daughter’s bedroom. (She’s quarantined in there because of flu.) Wife comes out sheepishly, “Happy Birthday.” My daughter told her to tell me happy birthday. My wife began to be slightly nicer to me after that. “Hey! Come with me to the bookstore and I’ll let you pick a book out!” as she waves my gift card at me. I got the cheapest book I could find because she still wanted to use the card to buy her friend something. 
 
We (she) had scheduled to go a couple towns south for a Christmas play she wanted to see with her best friend and her husband. (I do really enjoy their company!) Her friend is newly pregnant and decided to cancel on us because we had come into contact with the flu. I’m not mad at all about that, but had to listen to my wife complain about how much she missed them and nothing is the same without them. (Am I not enough?)  She asked if we could leave in the afternoon to do some shopping in that town for her friend’s birthday. Spent some money on her friend, ate dinner at a cool pub, saw the play, which was delightful, and came home. I tried one last time to initiate which also failed miserably. In her defense, the next morning she offered, “do you want me to just get on my knees for you and you can just get it over with?” No, I want to make love WITH you, not use you like some creep. 

One of the worst parts was the next morning, when she saw her friend, whose husband is much like my wife, and we all laughed about how our spouses are. It was soul crushing. 

That’s it. I’ve complained, and now I’m going to do the manly thing and put it in a box and shove it deep down inside. Sorry for the length. I’m not rereading this, so if there’s errors, there’s errors. ",3,1734871291.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

No matter what I do I can't cheer her up. She is in a depression and I am thinking about breaking up. But I know I'll be really upset if I do that. What should I do?,"Hi guys, we have been dating for 3,5 months and in our first two months I can say that this is the best relationship I have ever had. She liked me a lot. We work in the same place but in different departments. Every time I went to her building she was so happy and always said things like “Awww. I'm so glad you're here”. Seeing her smile made me extremely happy. I always questioned myself “What if I'm not a relationship guy?” but seeing her so happy kept me going and I thought I could finally commit to someone.

But 1.5 months ago we had an argument. She acted like my ex or maybe I overreacted and we had an argument. After that I was really upset and apologized. She accepted and we moved on. I was in another city when we had this argument and I offered to drive her to her flight when I arrived. She had a flight a few hours after I landed. She refused a couple of times but I felt guilty so I thought I should make it up to her and she accepted. When I landed I texted her a few times and she fell asleep. I texted her so she wouldn't get upset and when I saw she still hadn't woken up I didn't call her because I didn't want her to get on the flight without sleep. She called me in the morning and I told her I was picking him up but she was very angry. When I went to her house, for the first time she didn't hug me. I took her to her flight and when she came back to the city she was happy.

I thought her anger was gone but it wasn't like that. Whenever I made a mistake, her anger and stubbornness increased exponentially.

Whenever I made a mistake, her anger and stubbornness increased exponentially. One day I left early and on the way she called me and asked me for coffee. I couldn't turn back because I was almost home and my father was with me. When I got home I sent her a text saying I was sorry but she was so angry that I thought she was going to break up with me. I went to her house and we talked. I think there was a big argument but somehow we resolved it and moved on. Some simple things hurt her a lot and she punished the smallest mistake I made by getting angry and being cold to me. When I wanted to put it behind me, she would say sentences like “in time”. Life is very hard for her. Work is very hard for her. She cries every day and says she feels lonely. I spend all the time with her when I'm not working, maybe three days a week, but she says she feels lonely again and that I treat her like an assignment.

I really don't know what to do. It's like she could break up with me at any moment. We met at her house on Friday. I told her that she was very tired and needed to rest. I made her dinner, we chatted and put on a movie. Towards the end of the movie she was going to go to sleep and 3 minutes before the end she said “I have something to say but I don't want to ruin the day”. I insisted and she said, “I still feel lonely.” We talked some more and I cried a lot. Because when I feel that she is going to break up with me, I feel so sad. I don't know what to do.

I have to admit that she was the most beautiful being I've ever met, but for the last 1.5 months it's like she doesn't care about me. There is also this fact. She is a very, very beautiful woman.

here's my workflow (after having the coffee grounds in the FP):

\- pour 90ish °C water over the rather finely ground coffee

\- gently stir to not get half of the grounds stting in a crust above waterline

\- gently put the plunger in and let it sit just below waterline - again to avoid having coffee sitting above water where it will not do anything to a brew

\- at this stage, gravity will take over and all solids will slowly sink down to the bottom

\- come back after 5ish min and press the plunger slowly down. there is NO resistance whatsoever, since I have no crust to clog up the plunger (as reference: at this stage, a stack of 4 or 5 coins on top of the plunger would probably drive it down)

I recently took an amazing Grand Canyon South Rim bus tour from Las Vegas, and I just had to share my experience. It was honestly one of the best day trips I've ever taken, and I think you guys might find this useful if you're planning to visit.

First off, let me address the elephant in the room - yes, it's a long day (14 hours), but trust me, it's totally worth it. The tour picks you up right from your Vegas hotel, which is super convenient when you're half-awake at dawn.

The bus was actually pretty comfortable - it's got AC and a bathroom, which came in handy during the ~5-hour drive. Our driver/guide (shoutout to Mike!) was hilarious and kept us entertained with interesting facts about the desert landscape and local history. We made a quick stop in Kingman, Arizona, where I grabbed some coffee and snacks.

When we finally reached the South Rim, my jaw literally dropped. Photos don't do this place justice - it's mind-blowing how massive and colorful the canyon is in person. We visited several viewpoints, including Mather Point and Bright Angel Point. Pro tip: Mather Point at sunset is absolutely incredible for photos.

The tour includes a meal voucher, which was decent. We also checked out the National Geographic Visitor Center, where you can learn about the canyon's formation and history.

Here's where it gets interesting - I opted for the helicopter upgrade (through this link: https://athometouch.com/SouthRim), and it was probably the best decision I made. Seeing the canyon from above is a completely different experience. They also offer IMAX movie screenings and Hummer tours if that's more your style.

The base tour starts at $80, which I think is pretty reasonable considering it includes transport, guide, and food. If you're on the fence about upgrades, I'd say the helicopter ride is worth every penny - it's a once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience.

Some quick tips:
- Bring water and snacks
- Wear comfortable shoes (lots of walking)
- Don't forget your camera
- Layer your clothes (it can get chilly at the rim)
- Book in advance, especially during peak season

I booked through https://athometouch.com/SouthRim because they had the best rates and the booking process was super smooth. They also have great customer service - I had to change my date once and they were really helpful.

Feel free to ask any questions! I'm happy to share more details about my experience or help you plan your trip.

TL;DR: The Grand Canyon South Rim bus tour from Vegas is definitely worth it. Spring for the helicopter upgrade if you can, and book through https://athometouch.com/SouthRim for the best deals.",1,1734870328.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False
