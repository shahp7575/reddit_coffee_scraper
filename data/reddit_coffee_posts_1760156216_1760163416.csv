1o3o664,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1o3o664/first_time_ive_been_treated_decently_and_now_this/,First time I've been treated decently... and now this. The sting is unreal.,"Just need to vent to people who will get it.

I (31F) finally, for the first time ever, experienced what it's like to be in a relationship with a genuinely good man. After previous partners who treated me like garbage, this guy (together about 2 months) has been... wonderful. We're talking coffee in bed, actual respect, chivalry, the whole nine yards. All the little things I'd never had before. I was finally allowing myself to feel safe and dream a little.

Well, he just dropped the ""I'm not sure if I want kids or not"" bomb. He'd mentioned before that it would ""depend on the partner,"" which I probably naively took as a soft-maybe-leaning-no. But now he says he needs to think about it, and that he thinks ""being a parent is a great thing.""

Logically, I know it's good this came out now and not years down the line. I know a 2-month relationship isn't that long. I know this is the ultimate deal-breaker and there is zero compromise.

But damn, the sting is something else.

It feels like a hypothetical child is already being chosen over me. It makes the coffee in bed and all the sweet moments feel cheap, like I was just auditioning for the role of ""acceptable mother of his children"" instead of being loved for who I am- a woman who knows she doesn't want them.

I'm just so sad. I finally got a taste of what a good relationship could be, only to have it potentially ripped away over this. It just feels so unfair.

Check in is all the way down the A terminal in the last booths. Then you have to turn around and go all the way back to A to go through security.

Then after going through a gleaming modern airport filled with eateries and shops you get to the A 1-4 gates. No place to get a coffee, hard chairs and the carpet is disgusting. 

I can’t even talk about the sneer I got trying to use our Club Passes in the Aegean club.

1o3o42p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1o3o42p/i_left_my_husband_without_hesitation_when_i_was/,I Left My Husband without Hesitation | When I was nine months pregnant,"  
When I was nine months pregnant, I received an email with an electronic bank statement. My husband, Daniel Hart, had been transferring $30,000 to the same woman every month without fail. The first payment was dated back two years, right around the time we lost our first child.  
  
Then, as if on cue, my phone chimed with a messenger notification. from her.  
  
It was a friend request, along with a note that read:-  
  
“The happy woman who gets $30,000 in pocket money every month.’ I felt an eerie calm wash over me, almost unnatural. As I stroked my belly, I clicked ‘accept.’  
  
Immediately, a message popped up:  
  
‘Did you get the bank statement?‘  
  
Ignoring it, I went straight to her account profile. The earliest post was from two years ago, on April 21. In the photo, she leaned gently on a man’s shoulder, her hand resting on him, showcasing a massive diamond ring.  
  
The caption read:  
  
“Thank you for the birthday gift, love!”  
  
Although only the man’s back was visible, I recognized him instantly. It was Daniel. My husband. He was wearing the shirt Lhad bought him. during a business trip, the one with intricate embroidery on the collar.  
  
Two years ago, April 21, was the day lost our first child. While I lay in the cold, sterile operating room, undergoing a D&C procedure, my ‘on–a–business–trip‘ husband was celebrating another woman’s birthday.  
  
The irony was almost suffocating.  
  
  
  
My hands trembled as I scrolled further through her posts. Since that day, she had been flaunting all kinds of luxury items, each one identical to things I owned, except for one.  
  
A jasmine–scented perfume.  
  
Then I saw her most recent post, pinned at the top. It was an ultrasound image. She was pregnant.  
  
I dropped my phone, my heart pounding, and frantically searched through the dirty laundry basket. I found the shirt Daniel had worn the night before. Lifting it to my nose, the unmistakable scent of jasmine hit me.  
  
I never wear perfume.  
  
When I didn’t respond to the message, the person on the other end. grew impatient. My phone buzzed again and again as photos and videos came flooding in. Clutching my belly, I sank onto the couch, struggling to breathe.  
  
I forced myself to look at the undeniable evidence of Daniel’s betrayal. The woman in the photos was young and beautiful, her ponytail. bouncing with life. There were pictures of her and Daniel.  
  
He was rowing on a lake, playing in the snow, and tucking a maple leaf into her hair. It was as though each season, spring, summer, fall, and winter, was captured in their little love story.  
  
Taking a deep breath, I shakily opened one of the videos. In it, Daniel stood by the ocean, tenderly calling her ‘My Carina.‘  
  
She softly asked, “Do you love me?”  
  
This was my husband of seven years, the father of the baby growing inside me, replying with a warmth I hadn’t seen in years.  
  
‘I’ll always love you, Cara.’  
  
I replayed the video over and over, tears streaming down my face. As dusk fell, the room around me grew dim.  
  
Daniel finally came home. His voice was gentle as he lightly scolded me, “Olivia, why didn’t you turn on the lights? It’s so dark! What if you fall?”  
  
He flipped the light switch, and the room lit up. I quickly covered my tear–streaked face as he knelt in front of me and took my hand.  
  
“Why are you crying? Who made my precious wife and our little one so sad?” he asked, his voice soft as he kissed my belly.  
  
As he leaned closer, I smelled the same sweet jasmine fragrance. Struggling to keep calm, I asked, “Where were you?”  
  
“I was working late at the office. What’s wrong, honey?” Daniel replied casually, as though nothing was out of the ordinary..  
  
‘You’re lying, Daniel. You were with Cara! She had a craving for those famous dumplings from the east side of the city, and since there was no delivery, you drove over an hour from the west side to get them for her. She even live–streamed the whole thing!‘  
  
Feigning nonchalance, I smiled, gently squeezing his hand. “Honey, I suddenly have a craving for those dumplings from the east side, too,” I said, resting my hands on my belly.  
  
As if sensing my pain, the baby kicked hard. “Can you get some for me?”  
  
Annoyance flickered across Daniel’s face as he pulled his hand away, frustration creeping into his expression. “Those dumplings aren’t anything special. Besides, you’re pretty far along. You should watch what you eat.” Standing up, he added, “For the sake of our son, just bear with it a little longer, okay?”  
  
Without waiting for a response, he muttered, “I’m going to take a shower. I’m exhausted. Why don’t you call Mom and ask her to make you something?”  
  
The bathroom door clicked shut.  
  
Swallowing my sobs, I gently stroked my belly and whispered, “Oh, sweetheart, you and I are about to fight a tough battle together.”  


Chapter 2

  
  
Daniel’s phone blinked on the dining table. As usual, he never even tried to hide his infidelity in front of me.  
  
Did he really think I was that naïve?  
  
The sound of water running in the bathroom echoed through the house. With a sigh, I struggled with my pregnant belly and slowly stood up. Hoping for a quick solution, I tried all the obvious. passwords from our wedding anniversary and our birthdays, but none of them worked. My hands trembled as I entered the date from Cara’s ultrasound report.  
  
Success!  
  
Biting my lip in frustration, I sneered as I opened the messaging app’s storage. Sure enough, Cara’s profile picture was there. Their avatars matched.  
  
He said, “If love lasts forever,” and she replied, “Does it matter if we’re together every day?”  
  
I clicked into the chat and was greeted by a flood of “Darling, I miss you” and “Baby, when will I see you again?” Determined not to let my emotions take over, I activated the screen recording feature.  
  
Next, I opened Daniel’s shopping app. To my dismay, his order history was filled with pregnancy supplements, skincare products, and makeup. They were all sent to the same address. Every delivery was made to Cara.  
  
With one hand resting on my restless baby, I took screenshots with the other. I sent the videos and screenshots to myself, then carefully deleted the evidence. Satisfied that everything was in order, I placed the phone back exactly where I’d found it.  
  
Waddling back to the bedroom, I lay down on my side. The weight of betrayal settled over me as my heart felt like it had a hole ripped. through it, and I couldn’t stop shivering from the cold weight of betrayal. After seven years of marriage, I had been reduced to a cruel joke.  
  
When Daniel came out of the shower, his phone rang. From my vantage point, through the crack in the door, I saw his face soften as he answered the call. Glancing toward the bedroom, he carefully stepped out onto the balcony, closing the door behind him.  
  
Curiosity gnawing at me, I forced myself up and stood by the door, watching him. I couldn’t make out the words, but his expression was tender, with a slight smile. At some point, whoever was on the other end must have said something that made him frown in discomfort. But soon enough, he caved, agreeing with a subtle smile.  
  
The chill in my chest deepened. Slowly, I turned and dragged myself back to bed, feeling as if the air had been sucked out of the room. Even breathing felt like a burden.  
  
A few minutes later, I heard Daniel tiptoe back inside. One of his. hands rested on my belly while the other gently brushed the hair from my forehead.  
  
His voice was soft as he whispered, “Baby, there’s an urgent project at work. I need to go in.”  
  
I turned my head and stared deeply into his eyes. My last shred of hope flickered weakly as I asked, “I don’t feel well. Could you stay?”  
  
For a brief moment, I thought that if he chose to stay with me instead of running to her, I could try to forgive him.  
  
But then I remembered: Once the kite string snaps, it can never be fixed.  
  
As expected, Daniel gave me a troubled smile, trying to reassure me. “Sweetheart, this project is essential for the company. Lean’t miss it.” “I’ll call Mom to come over and stay with you, okay?”  
  
A wave of nausea washed over me, goosebumps prickling my skin. Still, I managed to force out the words, “Drive safely.”  
  
I lay there in silence, watching him get dressed and leave. Slowly, I got up, holding my belly, and made my way downstairs to hail a taxi. “Maplewood Estates,” I told the driver.  
  
He sped through the streets, and just as we arrived, I saw Daniel’s car pull in. My stomach clenched as I asked the driver to park behind a tree. From the back seat, I watched as Cara fluttered into Daniel’s arms like a butterfly.  
  
He caught her gently, placing a hand on her flat stomach. His face softened with a look of tender reproach, and he playfully tapped her nose.  
  
Cradling my belly with one hand, I took out my phone and switched to video mode. With trembling fingers, I watched through the screen as Daniel lifted Cara into the passenger seat and carefully buckled her seatbelt.  
  
My eyes burned, but I blinked back the tears.  
  
“Driver, follow that car,” I said.  
  
The car climbed onto the overpass, neon lights flashing by outside the window. In a daze, my nails dug into the window frame until they split, the sharp pain snapping me back to reality. I put my bleeding fingers into my mouth and bit down hard.  
  
As the car wove through the city streets, I repeated to myself repeatedly, “Olivia, endure it. The pain will pass.”  
  
When we arrived at Riverside General Hospital, I scanned the QR code to pay the driver.  
  
As I stepped out of the car, the usually quiet driver turned to me and said, with unexpected kindness, “Miss, take care of yourself. For the baby’s sake, don’t hurt yourself.”  
  
Since discovering Daniel’s affair, I hadn’t told a soul. The secret felt like poison, slowly eating away at me from the inside. The kindness of a stranger felt like a fresh breath of air, pulling me back from the abyss.  
  
I gently closed the car door, offering him a small smile. “Don’t worry, Sir. No–one can hurt me anymore. Because I’m ready to throw the trash where it belongs.”  


Chapter 3

  
  
I hid behind a pillar, watching Daniel. He had been too busy with work to attend a single prenatal check–up with me during my entire pregnancy. Yet here he was, running around the hospital, registering, picking up medication, and gently helping another woman in and out like the perfect husband.  
  
At that moment, I realized it wasn’t that he was too busy. He didn’t want to make an effort for the wife he’d been married to for seven years.  
  
In the bustling hospital lobby, Daniel held the woman close, reminding her, “The doctor said you should eat less tonight and try to stay active. In the early stages of pregnancy, digestion can be tricky, so let’s follow the advice this time, okay?”  
  
“Aww, fine, I got it!” she replied, pouting playfully. But it’s your fault! You bought way too many dumplings.”  
  
“Alright, alright, I’ll take the blame,” he said with a smile. “It’s my fault. for making my sweetheart eat too much, okay?”  
  
“That’s better.” She smirked. “Fine, I’ll forgive you… this time.”  
  
As I watched them, they bantered like a real couple, close and inseparable, while I stood under the hospital’s harsh fluorescent lights, feeling like an intruder in my own life. I was invisible to them. With a heavy heart, I held my belly and slowly shuffled out of the hospital. Outside, the scene was no less cruel. The rain had started. The cold autumn wind blew against me, and the rain felt like it was trying to drown the world in its chill. Through the mist, I watched as Daniel draped his coat over her, shielding her from the rain and gently helping her into the front passenger seat.  
  
The woman smiled up at him, grabbing his tie and pulling him in for a kiss. My husband cupped her face and kissed her deeply right there in the rain. When they finally pulled apart, he tapped her nose playfully, and she tugged on his tie again, biting his lip hard.  
  
To my surprise, instead of getting upset, he just smiled like he was  
  
thrilled. Then, he got into the car. As the car was about to pull away, the woman rolled down the window, locking eyes with me.  
  
She gave me a smug, taunting look and said, “Olivia, you’ve lost.”  
  
I smiled and shook my head. A strange calm washed over me. “It’s okay, Olivia.”  
  
Then, I whispered to myself, “He’s just a man, nothing more.”  
  
As the car turned the corner, I waved. “Daniel, I don’t want you anymore. You’re hers.”  
  
In that decisive moment, standing under the hospital awning, I calmly sent all the evidence I had gathered to my mentor, a well–known divorce lawyer. I was going to secure the best future for my child, no matter what.  
  
By the time I finished, the rain had already soaked the hem of my dress. Oddly enough, I barely noticed. Just as I put my phone away, it rang.  
  
It was Mom.  
  
“Olivia, I made some soup for you and brought it to the house. Where are you and Danny? Why aren’t you home?” Her voice was filled with warmth and concern.  
  
Before I could respond, she continued, “Oh, that Danny. You’re this far along, and he’s still taking you out? You really need to be careful right now.”  
  
Hearing my mom’s voice felt like a blow, like opening a floodgate I had been trying so hard to keep closed. All the pain I had been holding in grew into an overwhelming weight, pressing down on my chest. I bit down hard on my lip, fighting back the sob rising in my throat. The pain of suppressing it sent a shiver through my entire body.  
  
“Mom, don’t worry,” I said, forcing a smile even though she couldn’t see me.  
  
“We’re just out having dinner.” I swallowed hard, trying to keep my voice steady. “Oh, we’re being careful. Danny’s right here with me.”  
  
I had to keep it together. I couldn’t let my mom hear me cry. I wouldn’t.  
  
“It’s raining, Mom. Drive home safely, okay? Text me when you get there.”  
  
I hung up quickly before my voice could betray me. Once the call ended, I took a deep breath and tried to hold everything in, but no matter how hard I tried, the tears finally spilled over. I cried quietly, my body trembling under the weight of it all.  
  
There I stood, a heavily pregnant woman, belly aching, surrounded by strangers coming and going from the hospital. And in that cold, indifferent world, I cried until I had no more tears left in me.  


Chapter 4

  
  
Daniel didn’t come home that night. Instead, he only sent a text:  
  
‘Hey Olivia, I’m working late tonight and crashing into the office. It’s getting cold and rainy, so don’t forget to close the window before bed. Love you always, your husband.‘  
  
I read the message without feeling anything. In the past, I would have worried, replied, or waited for Daniel. Now, I didn’t even bother to respond. I used to think I was the happiest woman in the world because I had the best husband. But reality hit me hard. It had all been a ridiculous facade. People’s hearts are hidden behind their ribs, and their lies are scribbled on paper.  
  
A few days later, I received the divorce papers my lawyer had drafted. I printed them out, signed my name, and started packing up my things to move back to my mom’s place. Just as I was getting ready to leave, my phone rang with an unknown number.  
  
It was Cara.  
  
We met at a café downstairs. Cara arrived with an air of confidence, sitting across from me with a smug smile, a supermarket shopping bag by her side. Three months pregnant and balancing on thin high heels, she looked at me as if she had already won.  
  
“I thought you wouldn’t come,” she said, a smug lilt in her voice. “After all, you never replied to my messages.”  
  
I smiled calmly. My heart was steady, not a flicker of emotion breaking through. “Why wouldn’t I come? I haven’t done anything shameful that I need to hide.” I leaned back, still smiling. “Besides, Daniel and I are legally married, so I have nothing to hide. Unlike some people who, no matter how hard they try, will always be the hidden third.” “You-!” she snapped, but I cut her off again.  
  
“Oh, and thank you, by the way,” I said, my voice steady. “For sending me all the evidence of your little affair with Daniel. Collecting all that would’ve been much harder on my own.”  
  
I smiled, this time more dismissively. “So, this coffee’s on me.”  
  
I placed some cash under my cup, stood up slowly, and rested my hand on my belly.  
  
“What do you mean by that?” she asked through clenched teeth as she grabbed my arm.  
  
“It means I don’t want him anymore, I replied, pulling my arm free. “If you want him, he’s all yours.”  
  
Her eyes narrowed, and she threw my arm aside angrily. “What game are you playing now? Don’t think I’m buying this for a second!”  
  
The force of her shove sent me stumbling backward, and I fell to the floor. At that moment, it felt like a knife had ripped through my belly. Pain shot through me, and I felt my body convulsed.  
  
Blood poured from between my legs, and I screamed in terror, “Save my baby!”  
  
I barely registered Cara fleeing in panic. Forcing myself to stay calm, I asked the café staff to call an ambulance. By the time they lifted me into the ambulance, my dress was drenched in blood.  
  
As my consciousness began to slip away, I heard a nurse asking for my phone password. I unlocked it for her, and they called my emergency contact, my husband, six times.  
  
Finally, he picked up on the last call.  
  
“Olivia, there’s an emergency at work,” Daniel’s sharp and impatient voice said. We’re in the middle of a critical meeting. I’ll call you later, okay? Be good.”  
  
The line went dead. But I could hear Cara’s voice clearly in the background.  
  
I turned away from the nurse’s pitiful eyes and wiped the blood from my hands with my dress. My fingers shook as I took the phone and dialed my mom.  
  
I had to sound calm.  
  
“Mom, I… I’m going into labor.” I swallowed hard, fighting through the pain..  
  
My mom replied, “Don’t panic, okay? Just listen. Go to my place, grab my ID and the hospital bag, and take a cab to Riverside General. Whatever the doctors tell you to do, do it.”  
  
“I’m fine, Mom, really. Don’t worry about me.” I reassured her before quickly hanging up.  
  
Right then, the contractions hit me like a tidal wave, and I screamed.  
  
Cold sweat poured down my face, my whole body shaking uncontrollably. As I drifted in and out of consciousness, I used the last bit of strength I had to grab the doctor’s hand.  
  
“Please, save my baby!” I gasped.  
  
I couldn’t lose my baby. Not again.

I’m just looking for someone (or even a small group) to hang out with tonight.

I’m around the taguig/pasig/makati area, so anywhere nearby works.

I opened my eyes and it hit me—I was back. Back to the day I was supposed to sign my life away to that cursed marriage contract.  
  
My past life flashed before my eyes. My cousin Summer and I were both set to marry into the filthy-rich Riches family. I was promised to Rich ""Golden Boy"" Richie, the family's pride and joy, while she got stuck with his wheelchair-bound uncle, Rich Jr.  
  
Summer begged me to swap places, but I refused. So she ditched her wedding, left Rich Jr. at the altar, and turned the whole city into her audience.  
  
Then, when I was seven months pregnant, she teamed up with my own brother, River, to cut my baby out of me. They left me to bleed out in some basement, alone and in agony.  
  
But that wasn't enough for her. Summer went full psycho, scheming her way into Richie's arms until she became the new Mrs. Rich. My father knew everything—and helped cover it up.  
  
When my mom uncovered the truth and tried to fight for me, they locked her out on the patio. She jumped. She couldn't live without me.  
  
Now here I was, alive again, staring at the same gaudy living room piled high with gold bars and glittering jewelry. My dad was practically salivating, his double chin jiggling with excitement. Marrying into the Riches family was his ticket to power in this town.  
  
My father—usually colder than ice—actually looked at me with something like approval. ""Rainy,"" he said, ""you're finally good for something.""  
  
His words sent a shiver down my spine. Wasn't I supposed to be dead? Carved open? Rotting somewhere?  
  
Before I could even catch my breath, I heard a familiar whimper behind me.  
  
""I'm so jealous of you, Rainy,"" Summer cried, clutching her chest dramatically. ""You've always had everything—a mother who loves you, and now you get to marry someone like Richie Rich. And what do I get? A cripple who can't even walk.""  
  
She wobbled like she was about to faint. Dad and River rushed to her side, fussing over her like she was made of glass.  
  
""Summer, calm down!"" River snapped, shooting me a venomous look. ""You know what the doctor said—no stress!""  
  
My mom stood off to the side, wringing her hands. She's always been too soft-hearted. River and I are her twins, the center of her world. She never could stand seeing either of us hurt.  
  
Then Summer finally choked out the question I knew was coming. ""Rainy… could you please… switch with me?""  
  
It felt like a punch to the gut. The same request that started it all last time.  
  
Last life, I shut her down immediately. I married Richie, got pregnant, and then Summer—who'd gone missing after ditching her own wedding—showed up again, green with envy. She kidnapped me, sliced me open, and killed my baby. Then she took my place as Richie's wife.  
  
They thought a double murder was bad luck, so they skipped the funeral and flushed my ashes down the toilet. When Mom tried to stop them, they locked her outside until she jumped, joining her dead daughter.  
  
While I was lost in thought, Dad and River grew impatient.  
  
""Hey! Did you hear what Summer asked you?"" River barked, raising a hand like he was about to grab my ear.  
  
But Mom stepped in front of me. ""Don't you touch my daughter.""  
  
Dad's meaty hand swung down anyway—and caught Mom across the face. His sharp nails left a long, bloody gash on her cheek.  
  
""Mom!"" I cried, cradling her face. Rage boiled inside me, but I swallowed it down.  
  
I forced a smile and made a choice—the exact opposite of what I did before.  
  
""Sure,"" I said calmly. ""I'll switch.""  
  
Dad lowered his hand. Summer and River exchanged triumphant looks.  
  
Only Mom looked worried. ""Rainy, don't be rash,"" she whispered. ""This is your life—think it through!""  
  
Summer clutched her chest again, turning on the waterworks. ""Auntie, how can you be so unfair? Rainy has everything! Can't she let me have just one thing?""  
  
River jumped to her defense, glaring at Mom. ""Yeah, Mom, seriously? Why can't Summer have this one thing?""  
  
Mom looked heartbroken. Her own son, taking an outsider's side over hers. She fell silent, wiping a tear away.  
  
Quietly, I pulled Mom behind me and shot River a cold glare. ""I already agreed to switch. Why are you still yelling?""  
  
River opened his mouth to argue, but Summer tugged his arm.  
  
""River,"" she said sweetly, ""help me count the gifts first.""  
  
Her eyes were locked on the gold and jewels. She didn't care about Mom. She didn't care about me. Not then, and not now.  
  
But this time… things would be different.  
  
  


Chapter 2

  
  
Summer could have had all those things, but would they have truly been worth it?  
  
I knew Richie Rich better than anyone—and I knew he was bad news. If Summer wanted to suffer in my place? Fine. I'd let her.  
  
A month later, we got married on the same day.  
  
She walked down the aisle with Richie Rich, the town's golden boy. I married his disabled uncle, Rich Jr.  
  
On my wedding day, Rich Jr. wasn't able to stand and greet guests, so I faced the ceremony alone.  
  
Summer, meanwhile, floated through the crowd on Richie's arm, showered with attention and praise.  
  
My dad and my brother, River, doted on her, their faces glowing with pride. Only my mom watched me with anxious eyes, clearly worried about what my future held.  
  
It took some effort to reassure her and get her to hide her concern.  
  
Late that night, after the last of the guests had trickled out of the Rich family mansion, I found myself in the bridal suite with Rich Jr.  
  
He looked at me apologetically. ""I'm sorry you had to go through all that alone.""  
  
I just smiled, unfazed. I took hold of his wheelchair and pushed him toward the bed. ""We're married now. No need to be so formal.""  
  
He blinked, surprised. ""You're not… disgusted by my condition?""  
  
I shook my head, a soft laugh escaping me. ""If I were, I wouldn't have married you.""  
  
That brought a smile to his face too.  
  
I helped him bathe and change. Later, in the king-sized bed, he took my hand, and we both drifted into a dreamless sleep.  
  
After the weddings, Summer and I both lived under the same roof at the Rich estate.  
  
While Rich Jr. and I settled into a relationship built on quiet respect, she and Richie were like a pair of rabbits in heat.  
  
Two months later, Summer announced she was pregnant.  
  
Richie and Rich Jr. happened to be out of town, so Dad and River rushed over, absolutely over the moon.  
  
If it was a boy, he'd be the first grandson—the future heir to the Rich fortune.  
  
Dad even insisted that Mom stay behind to take care of Summer.  
  
The Rich household had more than enough staff. I didn't want my mom playing servant, so I spoke up. ""The housekeeper can look after Summer. There's no reason for Mom to stay.""  
  
Before I could finish, River stormed over like he was about to hit me. ""Rainy, you're heartless!"" he yelled. ""When I was drowning as a kid, you didn't lift a finger to save me! Now Summer needs help, and you're just being selfish!""  
  
""How are we even related?""  
  
I was stunned.  
  
I'd never understood why he hated me so much. Now it finally made sense.  
  
He thought I'd stood by and done nothing when he was drowning—that it was Summer who had saved him.  
  
But the truth was, I was the one who dragged him to shore. When I tried to climb out, the current pulled me downstream.  
  
He woke up with Summer by his side and assumed she was his rescuer.  
  
So in his eyes, I was heartless—and a clumsy fool.  
  
It was a stupid misunderstanding, one that could've been cleared up if he'd ever bothered to ask. But I was done explaining. If he wanted to hate me, so be it.  
  
  


Chapter 3

  
  
River's face flushed crimson with rage.  
  
Summer latched onto his arm. ""River, please, take me to look at the jewelry. I want to wear something new,"" she cooed.  
  
She was completely oblivious to my feelings—she didn't even glance my way.  
  
My mother stood there in silence. I took her hand and gently led her out of the house.  
  
We settled onto the sofa together, and Mom looked like she was struggling to find the right words.  
  
I cut her off gently and handed her a thick folder.  
  
Confused, she took it. ""What's this, Rainy?""  
  
""Open it,"" I urged.  
  
Her hands began to shake as she pulled out the photographs. She looked as if she might tear them to shreds right then and there.  
  
The pictures were of my father and her deceased sister. The truth was staggering: Dad had been having an affair with his sister-in-law even before he met my mother.  
  
Everything suddenly made sense. That's why my own father had always treated my cousin better than me.  
  
It turned out she wasn't my cousin at all—she was my half-sister.  
  
I had gathered this evidence myself, knowing I had to tell Mom.  
  
She broke down, crying and laughing almost hysterically. She was over fifty years old, and her whole world had just shattered.  
  
After a few moments, Mom stood up, went to the bathroom, washed her face, and carefully applied her makeup. Then, she headed back downstairs, her posture firm.  
  
I followed, ready to support her. She offered a strained smile to the three of them. ""Honey, River, you can go home now. I'll take care of Summer.""  
  
Dad and River exchanged bewildered looks, but Summer was beaming.  
  
Mom understood. Summer was doing all this to get back at her own mother.  
  
Mom simply smiled back, and the three of them ended up staying.  
  
Over the following weeks, Mom waited on Summer hand and foot, while Summer yelled and complained constantly. The food was too hot, then too cold—but Mom followed every command without a word of protest.  
  
Summer seemed thrilled. Within three months, she had ballooned to two hundred pounds. She probably thought she was happy—her figure was ruined, but she was finally pregnant.  
  
She insisted Mom accompany her to every doctor's appointment, just to flaunt the pregnancy.  
  
But at the three-month checkup, Summer went alone. When she returned, she was white as a ghost and locked herself in her room, skipping dinner entirely.  
  
Mom and I knew she was hiding something.  
  
The next day, Summer was suddenly all smiles. She invited me for tea to apologize—pointedly excluding Mom. I knew it was a trap, but I went anyway, determined to uncover her secret.  
  
""Rainy, I was wrong. I truly hope you can forgive me,"" Summer said, pushing a cup toward me.  
  
I didn't touch it.  
  
She wouldn't let up. ""These coffee beans are imported. Please, just one sip, Rainy."" Then she started sobbing dramatically.  
  
The sudden silence in the room made everyone stare at me as if I were the villain.  
  
Just to end the scene, I finally took a small sip. ""Are you happy now?"" I asked coldly.  
  
A triumphant grin flashed across Summer's face before she left.  
  
I rushed straight to the hospital, but suddenly, a hand clamped over my mouth, and I was dragged into a dark alley. I couldn't scream.  
  
A burning heat spread from my stomach through my entire body. I couldn't believe it—she had drugged my drink.  
  
A man with a foul stench started touching my face. I shuddered, trying to break free, but the drug made my limbs feel like lead.  
  
Just as I thought it was all over, a figure shot into the alley and sent the man flying with a powerful kick.  
  
I stared in shock as Rich Jr. pummeled my attacker. ""You… you can stand?!"" I stammered.  
  
He didn't answer. Instead, he called someone to clean up the mess, then helped me into his car. My face was on fire; the drug was taking over, blurring my vision. All I could see was the sheen of sweat on his neck.  
  
Rich Jr. swallowed hard. ""Don't move. We're going home.""  
  
All I could think about was paying him back for saving me.  
  
After that incident, Summer kept inviting me out, but I knew she was up to no good. I rejected her every time.

\[Gavin, I’ve landed. I’ll be at the city hall in half an hour.\] 

A faint smile touched Violet Miller’s lips as she pressed send on her phone. 

Today was the day she and Gavin Braxton were supposed to get their marriage license. 

Exactly five years had passed since they started dating in college, got engaged, and now, were scheduled to officially register their marriage. 

She leaned back in the seat, the morning light softening her delicate features. 

The taxi driver glanced at her smiling reflection in the rearview mirror and joked, “Hey miss, heading straight to the city hall to get hitched right after getting 

off the plane?” 

“Yeah. Today’s my lucky day. I made the appointment half a month ago,” Violet explained with a smile. 

The driver chuckled, “You young folks really care about your rituals. My daughter made an appointment for tomorrow!” 

“Congratulations.” 

“Same to you!” 

Yet, even after Violet got out of the cab, she hadn’t received a reply from Gavin. 

Her lips puckered in a slight pout as she dialed his number. 

The phone rang for a long time before it was finally answered. 

His voice was flat, unreadable. “Yeah? What is it?” 

Violet’s grip on the phone tightened. “Gavin, where are you? I’m at the city hall already. I just got our number, we’re about-” 

He cut her off abruptly. “Violet, I can’t make it right now.” 

Her throat constricted. “What? But we agreed to do this today.” 

“Yeah, something came up. We can do it another day. The date doesn’t really matter.” 

How could it not matter? She’d worked hard to get this specific appointment half a month ago! 

“Gavin, are you on the phone? Everyone’s waiting downstairs at the hotel for us to go for a coffee.” 

Violet’s heart plummeted. 

That was Luna Thorne’s voice. 

Luna, the girl who had been adopted by the Braxton family for eighteen years, was back? 

Violet’s fingers turned white around the phone, but before she could ask anything, the call was ruthlessly disconnected. 

He’d told her he was tired and went to sleep early last night. Was he actually up all night with another woman? 

A moment later, a text message popped up, 

\[Violet, was that you on the phone with Gavin just now? I just got back to the country. He threw me a welcome party last night, and we drank too much so he didn’t go home. Please don’t misunderstand.\]

Last time, my husband's secret daughter was diagnosed with acute leukemia. When it came time for a bone marrow transplant, he secretly took her in for the procedure. Her heart gave out mid-surgery. She died on the operating table at just four years old.  
  
By the time I reached the hospital, all that was left for me to hold was my little girl's ice-cold body.  
  
My husband just rolled his eyes at my tears. ""It's not like she was going to make it anyway. If her marrow can help someone else, then good for her. Karma, right? Maybe she'll get a better shot in her next life.""  
  
I wanted to tear his face off.  
  
He shoved me back and kicked me. ""This is your fault, you useless mother! You couldn't even give her a healthy body. You're both cursed!""  
  
That was it. I'd had enough. I grabbed him, and we went out the window—sixteen stories down.  
  
Then I woke up. Back on my engagement day. Right then and there, I called my dad. ""Dad, I'm not marrying Scott. Please switch the business deal to his brother instead.""  
  
Let's see how Scott and that tramp manage without me.  
  
I hung up, my hands still shaking. The memory of my daughter's cold skin was burned into my mind. Sixteen stories… then boom. I was back in the bridal suite.  
  
The party hadn't even started. I pulled myself together, snatched my dress, and got out of that room.  
  
As soon as I stepped into the hall, I heard them.  
  
""Scott, it's your engagement party. This isn't right. Miranda's right next door.""  
  
Scott's voice was rough, post-sex. ""Relax. She's desperate to marry me. She's probably just sitting in there, waiting all pretty. She can't hear us.""  
  
""And if it weren't for her grandfather pushing this business merger, I wouldn't even look twice at her. Have you seen her? Always acting so high and mighty. It drives me crazy.""  
  
My fists clenched. I wanted to rip him apart.  
  
He wasn't wrong. Our marriage was arranged because our grandfathers wanted it—a business deal, plain and simple. I wasn't in love with him. And last time, I'd just waited quietly in the bridal suite. I never saw this side of him.  
  
Then Miranda's soft, sickly-sweet voice chimed in. ""Scott, don't say that. Her mom died young, and her dad's never around. No one ever taught her how to behave…""  
  
That did it. I kicked the door open.  
  
I was still raw with grief over my daughter, and they had the nerve to bring my mother into this?  
  
They scrambled up from the couch, frantically fixing their clothes.  
  
The second Miranda saw me, her face twisted with anger. ""Chelsea, what the hell! What are you doing here?""  
  
I slapped her hard across the face. ""It's my wedding. What are you doing? Screwing my fiancé on the couch?""  
  
Miranda tried to hit me back, but I caught her wrist. With my other hand, I grabbed a fistful of her hair.  
  
Because of her, my daughter had died on that operating table—just to provide bone marrow for Miranda's child.  
  
But before I could land another blow, Scott kicked me hard in the side.  
  
""Chelsea, have you lost your mind?! You can't hit her! Do you have any idea who she is?""  
  
I crashed backward over the coffee table. Pain shot through my body, and I couldn't get up.  
  
The door swung open, and security guards poured into the room.  
  
Before I could speak, Scott shouted, ""Miranda is a Jones! You know the Jones family? Billionaires!""  
  
Through the haze of pain, I looked at Scott. He was holding Miranda, tenderly inspecting her reddened cheek.  
  
I smirked. ""She's a Jones? Since when did my father have another kid? Scott, care to guess why my last name is Jones?""  
  
  


Chapter 2

  
  
A second later, Miranda is in front of me. She kneels down and slaps me—hard.  
  
""Hold her down! You little bitch, how dare you hit me! So your last name is Jones? Big deal. Plenty of people are named Jones!""  
  
""What are you waiting for? Hold her down! I'm going to teach her what happens when she messes with me.""  
  
The guards grab my shoulders and shove me. The pain shoots through me, and I collapse on the floor.  
  
Scott walks over to Miranda, glaring down at me.  
  
""So your last name is Jones? So what? Miranda and I have been engaged for years. What have you ever done? Sure, you have a little money, but you're nothing compared to Miranda. You should be grateful I'm even willing to marry you.""  
  
""You should've done your homework before acting all high and mighty. Your father might love his wife, but Miranda carries her mother's last name—Williams. Just because you share a last name doesn't make you her, Chelsea. You're so pathetic!""  
  
My mother was killed when I was five. After that, my dad became fiercely protective. Everyone thinks I'm studying abroad. Even Scott didn't know my real identity until after we were married last time, so it's no surprise he's clueless now.  
  
As for taking my mother's last name—that's ridiculous. It's true, my father loved my mom deeply. But he never remarried, and he built his empire. I'm still a Jones.  
  
Miranda crosses her arms and spits on me. She barks at the guards, ""Hold her down.""  
  
She pulls out a Swiss Army knife, running her thumb along the blade as she gives me a vicious look.  
  
""Behave, and you might still get to enjoy the party. Mess with me, and I'll make you regret it.""  
  
I struggle, desperate to buy time. My dad will be here—he's coming to the party. I just have to hold on until he shows up.  
  
I look up at Scott. ""This is our engagement party! What are you going to tell everyone if she hurts me?""  
  
Scott doesn't even glance my way. Instead, he kisses Miranda.  
  
""It's just an announcement. You don't need to be here. I'll handle my grandfather.""  
  
""You should listen to her. Piss off Miranda, and you'll never become my wife.""  
  
He straightens his suit and walks out, locking the door behind him.  
  
Miranda stands over me, the knife hovering near my face.  
  
""You've got a pretty face. What happens if it gets… damaged? How will you seduce anyone then?""  
  
As she speaks, a sharp pain cuts across my cheek. I feel warm blood trickling down, staining my dress.  
  
I try to pull away. ""Miranda, you're going to regret this!""  
  
""Who wants Scott anyway? He's trash. I don't want him—""  
  
Miranda smashes an ashtray against my head. Everything goes fuzzy for a moment.  
  
I can still hear her voice.  
  
""Scott? He does whatever I want. I'll play with him for now, but I'm not marrying him. I'm a Jones. He's just a Scott!""  
  
""Shut her up! Someone stop her talking!""  
  
I can't see what's happening, but something foul is shoved into my mouth.  
  
Miranda kneels down, getting right in my face.  
  
""Which hand did you hit me with? Was it your right one?""  
  
  


Chapter 3

  
  
Miranda smiles, pulling out the knife.  
  
I try to roll away.  
  
""Oh? You can still move?""  
  
The guards pin me down again. The blade sinks into my leg.  
  
""Chelsea, I hate the way you act. I am better than you!""  
  
""And now you're pretending to be a Jones? Just because you share a last name with my father, and your mother died like mine, you think you can be me? I could kill you right now, and no one would even care.""  
  
The pain is so intense I nearly black out, but her words cut through the fog.  
  
""Let her go! I want to see her beg for mercy!""  
  
The guards release me. I drag myself toward the door, leaving a trail of blood behind.  
  
Miranda's laughter echoes behind me.  
  
""Hahahahaha! Chelsea, look at you now!""  
  
I lost my heels at the party. The knife wound in my foot screams with every movement, and soon I can't move at all.  
  
The door bursts open. Someone screams.  
  
""What the hell is going on?!""  
  
I see a figure rushing toward me.  
  
Scott's brother, Andrew.  
  
I don't know much about Andrew—only that he's Scott's brother and the CEO of the company.  
  
Andrew is a workaholic. In my past life, he never married, pouring everything into building the business.  
  
That's exactly why I asked to marry him.  
  
If I have to marry someone, it might as well be Andrew instead of Scott. At least Andrew wouldn't use my daughter to kill someone else.  
  
But for some reason, seeing Andrew now, I feel a strange sense of calm. Then everything goes black.  
  
I wake up in a hospital bed. My face is bandaged, my hands and feet wrapped. My father's assistant, Lee, sits beside me.  
  
""You're awake. You were stabbed, but it missed the bone. You just need rest. As for the cut on your face, I've contacted the best plastic surgeon. We'll make sure there's no scar.""  
  
Lee notices me glancing around.  
  
""They've been taken by the police. Don't worry.""  
  
""Your father is in a meeting, but he'll be here soon. Please call him. He's worried sick.""  
  
He hands me the phone. I can hear the rage in my father's voice.  
  
""Who did this to you?! I won't let them live after touching my daughter.""  
  
Lee said they were arrested, so they'll face consequences.  
  
And since I'm marrying Andrew, I'll soon be the Scott family's daughter-in-law. I don't want to cause too much trouble.  
  
""Lee said everything's been handled. By the way, did you tell them I want to marry Andrew?""  
  
He goes quiet for a moment, still seething.  
  
""I've spoken to their grandfather about the marriage. The engagement party is canceled.""  
  
""As for what happened, don't even think about hiding it from me. I'll find out myself if I have to. They hurt your hands and legs—I'll make sure they pay in kind!""  
  
I want to ask about Miranda, but he hangs up.  
  
Miranda's words keep echoing in my mind: ""I could kill you, and no one would care."" What makes her so sure she can get away with it?  


Chapter 4

  
  
I wake up to the sound of voices.  
  
At first I think it's my dad, but it's Scott.  
  
He doesn't even look me in the eye before he slaps me across the face.  
  
""Chelsea! What the hell is wrong with you? Why would you send Miranda to the police? Do you have any idea how much her father loves her? Are you trying to get yourself killed?""  
  
The door swings open and Miranda walks in. She's out of jail already? But she's got security guards trailing behind her. And there's a man with her—someone I've seen before.  
  
Before I can even process it, one of the guards swings a baseball bat and hits me. Hard.  
  
I feel blood trickling from my head before everything goes black.  
  
The man steps closer and looks down at me.  
  
""So you're the one bullying my daughter, is that right?""  
  
Then it hits me—I know who he is. He's my dad's driver.  
  
""You're my dad's driver, aren't you? What's going on—""  
  
I'm absolutely furious.  
  
She made me kneel for her—twice!  
  
Scott lets out a cold laugh.  
  
""You know what, Chelsea? The wedding's off. Your dad called my grandfather. The Jones family is marrying into the Scott family now. So you're nothing.""  
  
""Actually, I should thank you. After what you did, Miranda agreed to marry me.""  
  
I spit in his direction.  
  
""You're nobody. The Jones family would never marry someone like you!""  
  
Scott kicks me.  
  
""You're trash! Your own dad's driver is here, and Miranda's standing right there! When will you get it through your thick skull?""  
  
My head is spinning, my vision blurry. But then someone steps in front of me.  
  
""Scott! What the hell do you think you're doing?!""

My boyfriend (29M) is okay with me posting this on his behalf as we both know he’d take forever just to write a post like this himself, haha. I really want to see him happy with a good friend even if its mostly texting.

He hasn’t had many “guy” or non-cis male friends and would love to connect with someone he can chat with consistently - a genuine, nerdy friend to hang out with or just talk to daily. Eventually, he’d love to meet in person if you click.

He’s neurodivergent (ADHD + possibly on the spectrum), doesn’t drink, and is a big coffee lover. He can be slow to text back sometimes, but when he does, he’s thoughtful and intentional. He opens up slowly, especially with other guys, but is a loyal and caring friend.

He’s one of the most caring and selfless people I know. He’s looking for a guy friend he can nerd out with, someone genuine and open to honest conversations. He’s had a harder time making friends with men in the past, so having someone like that would mean a lot to him.

He’s also been on a journey of growth and healing for the last few years and would love a friend who values talking about feelings and personal growth - something he’d like to work on too - and isn’t afraid to open up with other guys.

He’s a huge music nerd (Debussy to death metal) and would love to meet another metalhead or musical theatre fan!

Brew time: 12 hours in the fridge

Grind size: coarse

I made sure not to over do it, and I made sure not to come off as thirsty as I like making no one feel uncomfortable.

He then goes yesterday to ask “when we hanging” then later “when you coming over”, signaling he wants the first meetup to be at his house and no where out or public.

*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Can’t Believe Arthur Rinderknech Made It to This Sentence*

---

**Parsing the Odds: Why Daniil Medvedev is the Tennis Equivalent of a GPS Saying “Recalculating” for Your Underdog**  
Let’s cut to the chase: Daniil Medvedev is the 75% favorite here, per the decimal odds (1.33–1.36), while Arthur Rinderknech clings to a 30% implied chance (3.1–3.3). To put this in perspective, Rinderknech’s odds are about as likely to win this match as my ability to explain quantum physics after one cup of coffee. Medvedev, the ATP’s human wrecking ball ranked 18th, enters as a -3.5 set spread favorite, meaning bookmakers expect him to win by a margin so wide, Rinderknech might need a GPS to find the net.

The total games line sits at 23.5, with the “Under” favored. This suggests a clean, straight-sets victory for Medvedev—a match where Rinderknech’s hopes evaporate faster than a ice sculpture at a Shanghai summer street fair.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Upsets, and Why Rinderknech is Here**  
Medvedev’s path to this semifinal was a masterclass in efficiency. He dispatched Alex de Minaur (7th seed) in the quarterfinals, silencing critics who questioned his “big three” credentials.

I didn't really have any friends and had little to no social skills to speak of. I didn't even try to make friends or small talk at work. I was too nervous. One of my biggest struggles is fear of rejection. Not just in a romantic sense, but just in general. I grew up the kid with no friends, no partners, little to no family in my life, etc. I got used to being quiet and blending in with the crowd. 

One day at work a coworker of mine came up to me and formally introduced himself. I can't remember exactly how he worded this next sentence, but he basically admitted that our manager had told him to come talk to me because she was worried I had no friends (she was right lmao). He didn't say it in a condescending way though or in a pitiful way. He turned it into a joke and told me we could be friends now. After that we spoke together at work every single day. He never made me feel left out, never made me feel like a burden, never judged me for something I said. It wasn't something I was used to. 

Eventually I started developing romantic feelings for him. I tried flirting with him, showing interest in him. But at the time I sucked at flirting. I had no idea what I was doing or how to do it. He was in and out of relationships, all toxic and short. We'd text about his issues in relationships and just life in general. It was always so easy talking to him. One day another coworker asked me out. At the time I was desperate for companionship and since it seemed like the coworker I liked (we'll refer to him as Isaiah from now on) didn't have the same interest in me as I had in him. So I said yes. 

That relationship ended up lasting three years and within that time Isaiah had met another girl he hit it off with and they started dating. I remember this upsetting me so much. I never acted upon this frustration except for one time. While at work one day he was joking around with me and I guess pushing my buttons a little too hard (I don't really remember the full convo, just one line I said) and I blurted out that I used to have a crush on him. 

He seemed shocked and a bit flustered for a moment. And then I added, ""Until I got to know you."" He didn't seem to take this seriously and I said it in more of a joking tone anyways. He laughed at it even. I think about that a lot, though I'm sure he probably doesn't even remember it at all. Eventually he and his girlfriend (who he also met at our place of work) decided to move in together and get different jobs in a neighboring town. I continued to date my boyfriend for another year after that. It was a toxic relationship from beginning to end. I won't delve too much into that though, as it is not important to the story. 

About a year after that relationship I started dating an even worse man. He was manipulative, a cheater, had anger issues, etc. I just ended things with him a little over a month ago, but it had been coming for a long time now. I didn't even cry when it was over. I had fully checked out months before the breakup occured. While in that relationship I kinda let my life go. I continued living with my mom (was supposed to be a temporary living situation), quit my job, etc. I have no car, no license, nothing. 

After the breakup I applied for another job and found out that Isaiah currently works there. I did not do this intentionally and we will even be working opposite shifts (he works day, I'll be working overnight). We ran into each other as I was coming in to see about my application (this was before I knew I got the job). We hadn't spoken in almost three years at that point, but we started talking like it was old times. He was on his way out when we ran into each other. He got off early and seemed in a hurry, but he still stopped to chat with me. We ended up talking for 20-30 minutes easily. We kept making each other laugh so hard, bouncing off each other so easily. I was the one to say goodbye and he seemed to hesitate to walk away. But I'm trying not to read into anything at all since he's still currently in a relationship. 

Since then I haven't been able to stop thinking about him again. I've been going through our old texts, thinking about all of our memories we share. Ever since we met I've never been able to get him off my mind. It's easier when I'm in a relationship, but when I'm single he's all I think about. I know his favorite band, how he likes his coffee, that he wants kids one day, etc. I remember all the stories he's told me about his life. I remember him telling me how good I looked one day when I was having issues with my body image. I remember breaking down one day at work because I had gotten yelled at by another coworker. He found me crying outside the bathrooms and comforted me. Told me to take all the time I needed. Made me laugh. Even my boyfriend at the time didn't do that. 

I'm not stupid though. I know my emotions could be messed up due to the recent breakup I went through, no matter how detached I think I am from things. Isaiah is familiar, safe, etc. I'm sure that's why it's so much harder this time to suppress the urge to like him. I'm not a homewrecker either, I would never act upon this crush as long as he's in a relationship. Not saying he'd cheat, but you know what I mean. He's been with his current girlfriend for four years now. Things seem to be going well for them. Though I'm not really sure since we have spoken in almost three years. 

I'm happy for him. I would never try to break them up. And, selfishly, I would not confess my feelings anyways at the fear of being rejected and then ignored. I have written a letter to him that he will never receive, it helped me get some of these feelings off my chest. For now I will do my best to focus on myself. I have a job now, I just got my learner's permit, and I'm working on saving up money to move out (with my sweet lil kitty). I guess I can update if something ever happens, but I doubt it will. I'm okay with keeping this a secret as long as it means I can continue being in his life. He deserves the world and more. ",1,1760160271.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I believe he’s a fearful avoidant but i think he has some secure traits. We had a really good relationship- no arguments, good communication, lots of love and care. The breakup happened fast and was overwhelming, for a short amount of time this break up hurts more than any other relationship has. He said we didn’t seem like the right fit and that I could find someone better, just something didn’t feel right in his gut feeling. We dated for about 4 months. After the breakup, we exchanged a couple of texts before he suggested not texting for a while as we both need space.

I’ll need to reach out eventually since we still have each other’s belongings. When would be the right time to reach out to a fearful avoidant ex, especially if I’d like to leave room for reconnecting as in just possibly getting a coffee together to catch up?

I should probably add that I myself am an anxious attachment but I have been learning to become secure which i have made some good growth so far.  ",1,1760160059.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

I haven’t been back. I can’t bring myself to. Too many memories of you - of us - in the halls, the walls, the space in between.

It’s been three days since I named you the villain in my story. Three days of trying to hate you more and more.

You’re there at dawn, before the birds start to sing.
When I eat.
When I get a rare ounce of stillness in my day.
In the twilight, when the day begins to fade away.

You make me want to be better. The best. 
I love you in that radio-over-my-head, stand-outside-your-window kind of way.
It’s pathetic, really. I’m a grown woman feeling sixteen again.

By now, I know I will always love you.
Part of my heart will always belong to you.

I don’t know what spell you cast to make me feel this way.

Maybe it’s your smile.
Your eyes.
Your hands - god, your hands. You know I have a thing for them.

I love you. I wish I’d said it to you face-to-face instead of writing it into the void.
Even if we can’t be together, I want you to know this: you are loved wholly, unconditionally, by me - for the rest of my days. 

In another lifetime, I hope we meet again and get a do-over.

1o3n3g8,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1o3n3g8/have_you_ever_felt_the_universe_was_trying_to/,Have you ever felt the universe was trying to tell you something? Do you see or believe in signs? Share the signs you've noticed - coincidence or deeper meaning?,"i've talked to many people over the years about this subject and whether the universe is trying to talk to us but we are so lost in the material world we fail to see the signs...

i was skeptical at first, but over time the coincidences, deja-vu, messages, opportunities and reflections were hard to dismiss and now have been embedded in my day to day things to watch out for.

1. the inner voice

i usually start the day with a shower, say some universal prayers and have a glass of water, then silence the mind and think about tasks for the day before work... immediately a few ideas pop into the forefront of the mind.  e.g. fix the shed, go shopping, put on the laundry...  so i make breakfast and plan what i'm going to do and in the process a inner voice tells me, leave the shed, its not going to rain for a couple of days (even though i can see dark clouds above), put the laundry and go grocery shopping...  has this happened to anyone? btw i didn't rain for a few days...

2. Coincidences

i had a dream about an uncle who i lost contact with many years ago, i woke up thinking that was more real than real... thought nothing much of it until 2 days later i get by mum, 'Mr X funeral is on Wednesday r.s.v.p.' the mind goes silent.  Was this his soul visiting me in my dream? reminding me of the time spent with him? or was his soul seeking connection now it was spirit? Does this sound familiar.  Has something like this happened to you.  Is it a coincidence?

3. Numbers

i used to get repetitive numbers come up all the time, 109, 11:11 never understood why, just laughed e.g. 6969... then 5yrs later a video came up about how Angels use numbers to connect with mortals as they are unable to speak to us.

So i typed in ""angelic number meaning 1357"" as it was coming up everywhere i went and eventually did scrolled down to the 3rd search (1st search result is what the divine wants you to do and is harsh, 2nd is what the spirit realm would like you to do 3rd is your true gentle meaning, 4th ignore, 5th is better meaning) any way this read..

*'Angel 1357 urges you to listen to natural urges and instincts.  They will give you all sorts of benefits and positivity'*

So i followed them, gave into to my food desires for one day, spoilt myself.... and funny enough i didn't feel starved as i did for the last 2weeks prior.  For the first time in week i slept all night long.  i spoilt myself once everyday but i did feel better inside, not so hungry....

i tested this on a friend, who i would meet every other day, and again she said, how weird i keep waking up at 333 everyday and then go back to sleep.  So we searched it,

*'the universe will do something amazing for you, and a lot of opportunities will appear out of nowhere into your life.  The blessings you are receiving are massive'*

Well she had no money, her boyfriend we found out was cheating on her, her x husband wouldn't leave the house.  Well, in 2 days, we met up, she told me her dad paid the deposit for a new car, she was picking the car up next month, she met another guy, didn't know if anything would come out of it but was meeting him on sat and would i like to go out with her on sat night, her shout, to suss' him out.

Is this normal for you? has something similar happened?

4. Blockages

Sometimes i plan a day to do something nice on my day off...  i end up waiting ages for a bus, then when i reach the train station the trains are cancelled.  i can't tell you the amount of times, i've had to message friends, i can't meet them.  Only to find out days later that the night, whether dinner, drinks or coffee shop was a disaster.

Is this the universe controlling me, preventing me from being hurt? or am i overthinking the situation?  Do you get blockages?

5. Feelings

i get a feeling, a very 100% feeling i'm supposed to go to xyz place and take a gift with me to give.  i shake it off, but the message is clear.  i have to go round to their house, but its a weekday they're both working so i assume, anyway, the feeling is there.... So reluctantly i phone them and say is it oki to come around? They say sure, were ordering an Indian pick you up in 5 mins.  Quickly i get ready and we have dinner round their home, as i leave their place i give the gift, saying that i was guided to give you this to the female of the household, its something i made.  She says thank you... turns out it was her birthday! and was something she was after.  Go figure!

i often end up to uninvited places as a result of these feelings, sometimes special events, one off pop ups, press releases....  often last minute picking up something on the way, which happens to be for someone there...

Is this  my mind picking up bit and pieces of information and somehow stores them for me to use at a later date? and i assume its a feeling?? Please give insights...

there are others signs, i get but am aware this post is getting to long, apologies.

**Conclusion**

in my little bubble i'm guided by these signs and have learnt to follow their guidance, because my path gets blocked, if i don't give them the attention they deserve.  i have felt these signs it seems to have helped me have more purpose in my day to day life outside of work.

Sometimes there is silence, and is unnerving as i feel i don't have a support bubble to guide me.  This usually happens to test if i can do what i'm meant to do on my own, without the 'signs' keeping me on track.

i don't know if i'm delusional or loosing the plot but has this happened to you or is happening atm?  please write.",2,1760159530.0,spirituality,2,1.0,False
1o3n390,https://www.reddit.com/r/KindVoice/comments/1o3n390/i_just_feel_so_unwanted_by_everyone_l/,I just feel so unwanted by everyone [l],"I'm 19m in college and I feel so alone and unwanted.
I don't even know where to start, these just so much going against me. I try and get out as much as a I can, but for one, i don't have a car so I can't go off campus easily and hang out at a library or go to some events, so that means for 95% of the time I'm stuck on campus (and my campus is in the middle of nowhere so I can't walk anyplace fun). Usually I go to the coffee shop or the library on campus just so I can get myself out there, but a lot of the time I'm stuck inside doing homework. And since I'm an animation major I have to be in the labs for school work, which are in the basement of a building only art students have access too, so I can't really do much there.
When I am out and about I stick to myslef but I try and do creative things, I'll do my homework that doesn't require the labs, I'll draw things, I'll 3d sculpt, I recently wrote an entire audio series, and I don't know if it's unrealistic, but not a single soul has said anything about it. Like I would have assumed at least someone would have been like ""that's a cool drawing, what's it for?"" (Then again I don't really talk to strangers in public, but it seems like that's a bad thing to do anyway by today's standards, idk).
But like the concept still applies, that nobody cares. Even my friends will do this too, I'll share something and they'll just ignore it. That raally sucks because they're all artists too, so I want to share my things with them and have conversations about it.
One thing I really hate that my friends do is they'll shot on men for no reason. Most of them are bi or gay or trans or nonbinary (I don't really care how they identify, they seem happy so good for them), but sometimes we'll be having a conversation and then one will go ""ugh I hate men"" and then they'll talk for the next 40 minutes about how all men should burn in hell. I never speak up because honestly what can I say? They're just gonna shoot down anything I mention by just saying ""yeah but all men are evil"" and that's not even exclusive to my friends! I hear that eveywhere, in public, on social media, in books, and it sucks. It really gets to me, because if it seems that modern culture is shiting on all men just because, what the hell am I supposed to do? (And yes I know some men are evil people, but they're also evil women and evil people in gernal, so what it gotta be so targeted?)
Idk I just feel so unwanted by everyone. People always say you need to have something to offer for people to want you. It seems that love has died and it's now a transaction where one party is except to provide everything while the other pretends to care about them all lecah all their stuff. I think I do have a lot to offer, I listen well, I care about people even when they're idealogies confuse me, I can entertain pretty well, I'm creative and my own person, I have hobbies. Yet when everyone looks at you funny for drawing on your iPad, how am I supposed to face that everyday with a positive outlook? It beats you down after awhile.
Another thing I hate about logic today is the ""you need to be perfect for someone to want you"" that's complete and utter bullshit. Perfection is a myth, it's never been, and never will be real. And even if it was, everyone has a different idea of what ""perfect"" is. I could think I'm perfect, but someone else could think I'm shit. Or even worse if you think your perfect, you're not attractive and confident, you're a narastitic douce bag. I don't want someone who's perfect. That's not good, I want someone I help grow, I want to be able to help someone see a side of themselves they haven't seen before, I want to help them and be the reason they change for the better. And I want that exact thing in return. Yet anytime I say that people always say ""b-but then you'll become fepent on your partner and you'll suck the life out of the, oh you don't love yourself! How can you even find someone who loves you if you don't love yourself, your just a leach who will only take and never give!"". It's like they didn't even hear what I said. Dependency isn't a bad thing, in fact I think it's good. I don't want a relationship, and eventually marage, where me and my partner are roommates who fuck. I want love. Real human love. And that requires dependancy. Not 24/7 not she puts in all the work while I do nothing. But a trade off, she does more work on my bad days, I do the same for her. We team up all the other times. We give %110 percent each day for the other person because we need them around. Yet when I say this I get crusified at the stake. 
Idk it all just feels so backwards, being a man=evil devil who needs to rot alone in hell. Having a different opinion, not liking hookup culture, and wanting real love=soul sucking leach who has no self respect or empathy for any other human beings.
Add this all up and it just feels that nobody thinks the way I do. No one takes the time to be creative in open spaces, nobody wants to commit to a relationship because it's too hard. Nobody what's to think about the hard topics and realize the common trend is wrong. 
Idk not a single person have ever said ""youll be a good partner to someone someday"" I just feel like I'm on earth and that's it. No rela purpose and little to fight for. Nobody who actively wants me around and is disappointed when I'm not.
And if all just makes me feel so unwanted and unlovable.

1o3n2i6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrincessCruises/comments/1o3n2i6/royal_princess_alaska_review/,Royal Princess Alaska Review,"Hi all! I lurked a lot on this sub prior to our cruise, so I wanted to contribute our experience. This is all just personal opinions and some tips that I think may be helpful. This is also me (28 F) and my husband's (28 M) first ever cruise.

Long review but TL;DR, we enjoyed it but would prefer to try a newer ship next time.

**Cruise**

Ship: Royal Princess  
Date: 9/13 - 9/20/2025 (7 days)  
Ports: Seattle - Juneau - Skagway - Glacier Bay - Ketchikan - Victoria - Seattle  
Cabin: Deck 9 (Dolphin), BB Balcony, D502  
Package: Princess Plus (old version)

\--

**Flights**

We arrived in Seattle a day ahead of embarkation and stayed a day after disembarkation. We stayed at the Coast Seattle Downtown Hotel by APA and it was really nice! It was relatively cheap in the downtown area and close to the Light Rail station. We didn't do any touristy stuff because we used to live in Seattle. But we got to visit family and checked out some restaurants that we missed.

**Booking**

We booked through Costco Travel. It was a very easy process. The pricing was always the same as booking directly through Princess, but Costco offered extra Onboard Credits (OBC) and a Costco Shop Card. Our total was $4646 for a BB category balcony with Princess Plus, which came with $200 OBC and $305 Shop Card. I do remember that we did not see $200 OBC mentioned anywhere while booking, but it was included in our confirmation email. I recommend using Costco Travel if you have their membership! We've used it before for a Hawaii trip and both were great experiences.

**Better Than Best Price Guarantee**

Princess has a Better Than Best Price Guarantee program that if you find a lower price before final payment, they’ll give you 120% of the difference as OBC. I frequently checked the Princess website after booking and noticed the price actually dropped a lot. I sent the request 4 times because it just kept getting lower and lower. I was approved all 4 times and received a total of $1016 in OBC (non-refundable), even though I booked through Costco Travel.

**Onboard Credits (OBC)**

We got $200 from Costco and $1016 from Princess, both non-refundable. I did some research and learned that you can actually use them at the casino!! This was what we ended up doing. You just tap your Medallion at the slot machine, select ""charge to room"", and select the amount. You can play some slots and then click ""cash out"", the money will go to your ""bank account"", which is just your Princess Casino account. When you want to get the actual cash, just go to the cashier and ask them to cash out.

**Ship**

Our home port is actually San Francisco, so we originally wanted to go with the Ruby Princess out of SF. However, a travel agent suggested that it might be better to fly to Seattle for the Royal Princess. The reason was Ruby would have extra sea days (Ruby was 10 days, Royal was 7 days), which might not be ideal if I do get seasick. Additionally, extra sea days means extra $$ for the Princess Plus package, and there are no extra port stops. So I made a spreadsheet to calculate costs. Even with the extra lodging & plane tickets, it actually came out cheaper than the Ruby out of SF.

I did consider the newer ships, but the timing didn't really work with our schedule and they don't go to Glacier Bay. My online research told me that Glacier Bay is a must for Alaska cruise, so we ended up picking the Royal Princess. Overall, I think Royal Princess is a great ship but it definitely shows its age. Common areas are very nice and pretty, but the rooms could use some updates. I will talk more about it in the cabin section below. I think I would want to try the Star Princess if we decide to go on a cruise again.

**Boarding**

The boarding process was a breeze. I already printed the luggage tag so we just had to drop it off at the luggage collection. If you didn't print it, there is a counter with a small line that will help you print it. We then went through security, and then they checked our documentations. It took less than 30 minutes for us to get on the ship and we didn't sit down to wait at all. They actually gave us a group number to go sit down and wait for boarding, but when we got to the seating area, the number was called already. However, our checked bag took a while to get to our room. I think it finally arrived to our room at around 6 pm. It did scare me a little because the Airtag I had in there didn't really work well at sea, likely due to no cell service.

**Cabin**

https://preview.redd.it/eivelhhbqeuf1.jpg?width=8064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79f301f325352456d7ae9114593852bd22d3377d

I wanted something close to the middle and not too high up to avoid seasickness, so I ended up picking D502. It still has room decks above and below, and it's the first cabin of the ""mid-aft"" category. The price was slightly lower than ""mid-ship"" but the location is still close to the middle. I really like the cabin location!! It's super close to the elevators, but I never had any noise issues. The view was wonderful, no obstruction, though you can still see the lifeboat below. The balcony space was quite small, so I cannot really imagine having a balcony breakfast/lunch/dinner there.

The bathroom was very very tiny, and they use a shower curtain instead of a door. The shower curtain had this old mildewy smell which I really didn't like. There was no ventilation AT ALL, so the bathroom gets very humid after shower. I did bring a Poo-Pourri, which helped immensely for our toilet uses. There was only one US electrical outlet in the bathroom but it's only big enough for a non-polarized plug. I couldn't use my water floss, we even requested an extension cord from the guest service, but it also had a polarized plug so it didn't fit either.

The bed was comfortable, but the bedding left something to be desired. There were only 2 electrical outlets total in the bedroom area. I did bring a non-surge-protected power strip I got on Amazon. I highly recommend getting one if you have more than two devices that need charging! I also got small magnetic hooks and they were useful for hanging our raincoats. Pop-up laundry basket was a good tool for our dirty clothes. The laundry room was convenient but slightly expensive. Washing and drying were $3 each. If we could choose again, I think I would pay extra for the deluxe balcony to get a couch in the room. Not having a couch was very inconvenient for us since we don't like to wear outside clothes in bed.

**Seasickness**

I started taking Bonine 2 days before the trip, every night before bed. I did not get seasick at all throughout the trip! There was one night that I think I almost got seasick because the weather was bad and the ship was swaying a lot. But I was already falling asleep so nothing happened.

My husband though, was saying he doesn't need the pills. Then he got kinda dizzy I think on the second day... so he finally started taking Bonine with me and felt better afterwards.

**Food**

https://preview.redd.it/7vyrilrdqeuf1.jpg?width=4567&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0040e565e2084528ab7afc7a201d6f971dbf806e

https://preview.redd.it/b11xr38eqeuf1.jpg?width=2755&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bdbe6b06606460df3e700cfe8ab0f10877c0a7c

The food was AMAZING! We tried out the MDR lunch (Allegro Dining Room) on embarkation day as suggested by frequent cruisers to avoid the buffet crowd. The beef tenderloin was so tender and cooked to perfection. The orange soufflé was only offered on embarkation day, and was my husband's favorite dessert throughout the trip. I highly recommend checking out MDR on the first day!! They open at 11:30 am, so no need to get on the ship too early. We arrived at the port at around 10:30 am, did not wait at all throughout the process and got on the ship before 11 am. It was a bit too early I would say, so I recommend just getting to the port at around 11 am if you want to try the MDR.

I booked our dinner reservations at the Symphony Dining Room before the trip; it's at the same time every day at the same table with the same servers. Our servers, Alvin and Reagan, were phenomenal. They remembered our drink preferences and just brought them out without asking later in the trip. They also told us to order whatever we like on the menu, even if we want multiple of the same item. The food was wonderful so we dined there almost every evening. We only ate off the ship one evening in Juneau and one evening at Alfredo's.

For Casual Dining, we tried both the Alfredo's and the Ocean Terrace. Alfredo's was really good! My husband really enjoyed his New Yorker pizza. I got the Pizza Tarantina, which was a seafood pizza and I really liked it except that it was a bit too salty. We both think Ocean Terrace was not very worth it. The food portion was a lot smaller, and I think the sushi quality was just ok.

We did frequent the buffet on the Lido deck for breakfast and lunch. There were a lot of food options, but I felt A LOT of motion every time we dined there. I didn't really get seasick, though. We also loved the ice cream from Swirls. I don't want to admit this but we probably went there once or twice every day... we both think Swirls was better than Gelato! My husband also tried the bacon cheeseburger and chili fries at Trident Grill and really liked them.

**Ports**

Juneau - loved it! We did the Whale Watching & Mendenhall Glacier Tour and they were the highlight of our trip. The tour guides were all very knowledgeable. The weather wasn't the best, but we still got to see a bunch of whales. We ate at Tracy's Crab Shack and really liked it! Although it was very pricey. Pay with cash or debit card if possible... we didn't see that they charge a 3% credit card fee until after we paid.

Skagway - our helicopter tour got cancelled because of bad weather :( We ended up just walking around the town, visited the Skagway Museum, and ate at the Skagway Fish Company. Loved the food there but it was quite busy. If you plan on mailing postcards, there is a USPS in the middle of the town. They do have a lunch break from 11:30-12:30pm.

Glacier Bay - I believe we didn't go inside too much due to bad weather. We just sat on the balcony for a little bit, saw one glacier, and headed back inside. The visibility wasn't very good so that was a little disappointing.

Ketchikan - very cute town. We did the Crab Feast at Harbor Haus, the crab was delicious! I believe they only started doing crab feast not long ago. They have long lines there for the lumberjack show and a bit understaffed so the check-in process was a bit chaotic. They also made everyone watch a video about Ketchikan and demonstrated how to crack open the shells, which made the eating time a lot less. But we still enjoyed the food there. My parents collect Starbucks mugs so we actually walked to the Starbucks inside Safeway west of the port to get the Alaska mug. It was probably a 30-minute walk, not too bad. But then we noticed there was actually free shuttles that take you around the town. There was a stop at the Safeway so we took it on the way back to town.

Victoria - it was a late and short stop so we just walked to downtown and then walked back. There wasn't much open since it was so late, but we got some poutine at BeaverTails and that was pretty good. I wish the stop was during the day so that we could check out some shops.

**Princess Plus**

I think the package was worth it for the WiFi and gratuities! Although the internet speed wasn't very fast and was a bit spotty sometimes. We both don't drink alcohol so we just used it for bottled water, sparkling water, and coffee. I did try out some fitness classes (Pure Barre and Stretch Lab) and those were nice. We didn't get any premium dessert since they all look wayyy too sweet.

**Disembarkation**

The disembarkation process for people who are bringing their own luggage off was a mess. We were assigned a group number to get off at a certain time, but everyone just blocks up the exits even when it wasn't their turn. Our group also never got called, we noticed they started calling later groups so we went to check with a staff. They were like ""we called it a while ago!"" even though we stood there listening the whole time. They also forced everyone with 2+ suitcases to take the elevator at the port so it created a huge bottleneck. If you are able to carry all your suitcases and take the stairs, I suggest you just walk straight to the stairs and not wait in the long lines. There is an escalator, but the security will not let you use it if you have more than 1 suitcase. I understand it's for safety but... it was a bit much.

\--

Overall, we really enjoyed our cruise! It's kinda sad that we didn't get to see any northern lights and that there was a storm. But all the good foods made up for it. Hope this helps!!

After a week of being sick (I did use advil cold and sinus - which I always do when I’m sick or on my period and have no issues with), I developed excessive burping on the 7th day. The 8th day I noticed trapped gas and a lot of heartburn. The 9th day the burping subsided, but heartburn still present. It’s now the 10th day and I am still swallowing mucus, having heart pain now (feels like random stabbing).

I went to the doctor and they found I have an ear infection and gave me antibiotics. They also think my other acid related symptoms are temporary irritation to my stomach lining possibly from the mucus from when I was sick or the advil. They gave me an H2 blocker called Ranitidine and Gavicson. Along with this, I incorporated L glutamine, Licorice root, slippery elm, and aloe vera juice. 

I have been going on a research spree on tik tok and reddit and have been super anxious and panicking that the acid reflux and heart burn will not go away as some people mentioned it stays. I am also on a some what bland diet in which I’m trying to avoid spicy stuff other then the daily cup of coffee (my doctor decided to keep the cup of coffee in to support bowel movements) and some spices on my chicken (trying to eliminate as I find more food choices).

They reassured me that I should feel better after the 7 day course of the H2 blocker and diet change. However, I am extremely worried that its going to stay and not go away as I have never had this happen before.

I wanted to share something I’ve been experimenting with lately and see if anyone else here has tried it too — it’s called **Pineal 10x**. I stumbled across it while researching natural ways to improve my **sleep quality**, **mental clarity**, and **meditation focus**. I’ve seen so many supplements that promise “brain enhancement,” but this one caught my eye because it focuses specifically on the **pineal gland**, which people often call the “third eye.”

# Why I Tried It

For context, I’ve been dealing with pretty inconsistent sleep for a few months now. Some nights I’d crash easily, other nights my mind would be racing. I also got into reading about how the **pineal gland** affects melatonin production and overall mental balance — so when I saw a formula that claimed to support its function, I figured, why not give it a shot?

I started taking **Pineal 10x** three weeks ago. No major expectations at first — I just wanted to track how my sleep and mental clarity changed over time.

#  Week 1: Subtle Shifts

The first few days were pretty normal, but by the end of the week, I noticed I was **falling asleep faster**. Normally, I’d toss around for 30–40 minutes before dozing off, but that dropped to maybe 10–15 minutes. My dreams also started feeling **more vivid** — not in a weird way, just clearer.

# Week 2: Mental Calmness

Around the second week, I realized I wasn’t as “foggy” in the mornings. My focus at work improved slightly, and I wasn’t hitting that mid-afternoon mental wall as often. I’m not saying it turned me into a productivity machine overnight, but the **mental calmness** was noticeable.

What really stood out was how balanced my mood felt. Normally, I’d fluctuate a bit with stress or caffeine intake, but things just felt more stable.

# Week 3: Deeper Sleep & Clearer Thoughts

By week three, I started waking up before my alarm — which, honestly, has *never* happened. I used to rely heavily on coffee to get going, but now I just drink it out of habit, not necessity.

One interesting thing I’ve noticed: my **meditation sessions** have become more focused. It could just be placebo, but it feels like my mind settles down faster, and I get into that “stillness” mode more easily.

# Final Thoughts

I’m not claiming **Pineal 10x** is some miracle brain pill. But for me, it seems to genuinely help with **sleep consistency**, **dream clarity**, and a **general sense of mental alignment**. I’m still testing it out, but it’s been a surprisingly positive experience so far.

If you’re into **natural supplements** or interested in the idea of **pineal gland activation**, it might be worth researching. I’d actually love to hear from others who’ve tried similar things — was your experience the same? Did it help with sleep or focus?

* Rice with furikake
* Rice with pickles
* Toast with banana

All result in \~3 hours of diarrhoea and stomach cramping/nausea.

IDK what else to try... My diet is very limited (GF, Vegan, canola oil allergy, sensitive to sugar)

I have tried with and without coffee, I still get diarrhoea, but without coffee it's just slower.

I am looking for models for fun, casual photo shoots in a variety of alternative styles depending on your own interest including pinup, cosplay, shibari, and the like. Not so interested in just standard portrait or fashion photography but also open to shoots involving traditional outfits or costumes such as kimono, saree, etc. You don't need experience or traditional model looks at all, just be fun and open minded. I most prefer a model who offers a degree of input and her own ideas. As per board rules I can't offer any payment but I am happy to treat you to a coffee or drink if you would like to meet up beforehand to decide if you are comfortable shooting, for example. You will also receive all the photos and can use them as you wish (for example on your own socials, etc.--as long as you give me credit). Thanks! Preferred location is around Ikebukuro station [https://maps.app.goo.gl/FBjG8kJuyo59u6tG8?g\_st=ac](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FBjG8kJuyo59u6tG8?g_st=ac) but I am open to other locations based on your own convenience.",0,1760158666.0,tokyoirl,1,0.33,False

1o3mpqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1o3mpqy/the_day_the_sky_turned_to_ash/,The Day the Sky Turned to Ash,"It was 9:10 in the morning.
Sunlight streamed through the cafeteria windows, spilling across the tables, leaving a soft golden hue on each one.

In one corner, a boy sat alone — a book in his hand, a steaming cup of coffee before him.
The rising steam seemed to dissolve into his thoughts. He took a small sip, then set the cup down gently.

The hood of his sweatshirt was pulled up over his head — as if he wanted to hide his face from the world.

Then, the door opened.
A woman walked in — jeans and a light-blue top, perhaps in her early thirties. Ordinary, yet her eyes carried a deep weariness, as though she hadn’t dreamt for years — only regretted.

She walked up and sat across from him.
The boy slowly closed his book, placed it on the table, and looked at her.

“Coffee?” he asked calmly.
She nodded.
He called the waiter. “One more coffee, please.”

For a few seconds, silence sat between them — heavy, unspoken.
Then the woman said softly,
“Victor… come home.”

The boy laughed — but there was bitterness in his smile.
“Home?”
He lowered his gaze. “You mean that prison you called home? The place where you kept me ‘safe’?”
His eyes met hers, sharp and steady.
“Tell me, Doctor… safe from whom? Look around. There’s no one here who can hurt me. The danger isn’t to me — it’s to you.”

Her lips trembled. “Victor… please, don’t be angry.”

“Don’t call me Victor!”
His voice cracked like thunder. “That name — you gave it to me. You named an experiment. But I’m not an experiment. I’m alive!”

The Doctor exhaled deeply, tears pooling in her eyes.
“Maybe you’re right… maybe I did cage you. But I loved you, Victor. I still do. Please… come back.”

He remained silent for a long moment.
Then said quietly, “It’s too late, Doctor. There was never a home to return to.”

“Don’t say that,” she whispered desperately. “The world’s changing. People are changing. Maybe, just maybe… things can be right again.”

Victor looked at her for a long time — then smiled faintly, bitterly.
“Doctor, did you ever hear those fairy tales as a kid? Where a god comes at the end, waves his wand, and makes everything right again?”
He leaned forward.
“In real life, peace has a price.
And that price… is blood.”

Her heartbeat quickened. “Victor, please—”

But he closed his eyes.
When he opened them again, they glowed violet.

The spoon beside the cup lifted off the table, the air grew heavy, the tables rattled. A gust of unseen force rippled through the entire café.

“Stop, Victor! You don’t have to do this!” she screamed.

His voice turned cold.
“It’s too late, Doctor.”

A second later — a purple explosion.
The light was blinding. She covered her eyes, screaming.

Then… silence.

When she finally dared to look — the café was gone.
Everything had turned to ash.
The air shimmered with dust; the ground was scattered with burning fragments of what once were people.

She looked up —
Victor was floating above the ruins, surrounded by a swirling storm of violet energy. The very sky seemed to burn with his rage.

Tears fell from her eyes.
“What have you done, Victor…” she whispered.

And Victor — slowly, like a dying star — began to fade into the sky.

That day, the heavens weren’t blue.
They were gray — and full of ash.

I've also played some of the other games that this developer has made - namely Ghostrunner and Ghostrunner 2. 

After playing the demo, I realized this game has some serious potential but certain aspects need to be reworked. Here are the three that come to mind:

1) Boss hitboxes - Some of these hitboxes feel like they hit from half the arena away and even though it might look like you're a foot away from them you still get hit

2) Parry timings - As someone who loves parry-heavy games like Sekiro and Khazan, I was quite intrigued with Valor Mortis. I found the parry timings, especially in the boss fights, to feel a little off. Even though this fight is not especially difficult, it took me longer than it should have as I had some issues getting some of the parry timings down. I can't really describe what it is, the parry window/timings just don't feel quite where they should be.

3) Boss moveset - Some moves have such a long telegraph you might be able to go make yourself a coffee and then come back and be ready for the parry. Other moves feel like they come out near lightning fast in less than 0.25s. This massive discrepancy does not feel very nice.

I think the game did a lot of things well such as world design, atmosphere, and the concepts that it has come up with. But I think the devs need to take their time and cook with this one. It has a lot of potential, but it's nowhere close to being ready!",0,1760158046.0,soulslikes,2,0.5,False

When i was 4 he freaked out when babysitting me and my sister and he put us in car, drove like a maniac then rolled window down and screened at construction workers then got home and threw coffee and couch. Once he was in a rage and hit holes in the wall in front of me and my sister. I think i was 10. I remember he threw a pizza at my mom once, and once on easter he threw coffee inside and it was everywhere. I remember when i was 10 he told me he was leaving and i was “90% of this shit”. He once said he wishes i wasnt born, think i was 11. When i was 19 he was hitting his head  the wall and ran to his shed told me he was offing himself. i was dialing in 9 1 1 just so happen my mom pulled in the driveway. I remember on 4th july he woke and up freaked out for no reason and woke me and my sister up in a rage. i was probably 10. Once when i was 5 i asked him to help me with my legos and he grabbed it from me, looked at it, then threw it. When i was 12 he got in road rage with a biker and the biker said certain thing ill say. i was terrified. My dad told me to suck it up or whatrver the fuck he said. And this is just the stuff that comes to the top of my head. Hes ruined vacations, holidays, etc. im 23 and my parents are still happily marrried. Theyve had plenty boy of cry wolf situations  where they were getting a divorce but theyre both pathetic and never would. During these times, my mom acknowledged all this abuse.  Now, she acts like it never happened.

Chapter 1 

I crouched in the corner, my heart in my throat as the sound of footsteps grew nearer. 

“Congratulations, Mr. Willowstream. You have one wife at home and another abroad. It must be nice!” a subordinate teased. 

My heart clenched painfully. 

Then, I heard Arnold Willowstream chuckle. “Nonsense. Yasmine stood by me when I became a cripple back then. That’s why I 

agreed to marry her. She truly loves me and would give up everything for me. 

“But Juniper will always be the one I love. No one is to mention this to her–ever.” 

His voice was gentle, firm, and sharp as a blade carving straight through my heart. 

He used to bring me my favorite coffee every morning. On my birthday, he filled the sky with drones and prepared a sea of flowers 

just to tell me how much he loved me. 

Then came the accident. That terrible crash hurt his legs and made him a different man altogether. 

As the boss of a mafia family, he couldn’t accept becoming a cripple. His personality changed overnight. He started pushing me 

away and forcing me to divorce him. 

“Juniper, I’m a broken man now. **If** you stay, I’ll only drag you down. Someone like me should just die alone.” 

He threw a signed divorce agreement at me. His eyes were bloodshot, his voice hoarse and hopeless. 

“Sign it. Let’s end this marriage. Go find the life you deserve.” 

However, how could I leave him when he needed me the most? 

I held his hand tightly and told him unhesitatingly, “I’m not going anywhere, Arnold. Never. Stop saying those things. I’m staying with you.” 

But it was like he couldn’t hear me. He spiraled deeper into despair. Some days, he’d lash out in anger. 

“Juniper! What are you waiting for? Just sign the damn papers! What’s the point of clinging to a cripple like me? Leave me. Please. Once you’re gone, I won’t have any reason left to live…” 

I never signed the papers. I stayed by his side, no matter how hard things got. 

To help him walk again, I left the country. I spent endless nights buried in the lab, trying to develop a treatment that would

That connection, even across the ocean, kept me going. Thank goodness, he finally recovered. 

But now, I stood there watching him marry Yasmine Cooper. I heard him speak about his feelings toward her.

Do you see or believe in signs? Share the signs you've noticed - coincidence or deeper meaning? Insights please...,"i've talked to many people over the years about this subject and whether the universe is trying to talk to us but we are so lost in the material world we fail to see the signs...

i was skeptical at first, but over time the coincidences, deja-vu, messages, opportunities and reflections were hard to dismiss and now have been embedded in my day to day things to watch out for.

1. the inner voice

i usually start the day with a shower, say some universal prayers and have a glass of water, then silence the mind and think about tasks for the day before work... immediately a few ideas pop into the forefront of the mind.  e.g. fix the shed, go shopping, put on the laundry...  so i make breakfast and plan what i'm going to do and in the process a inner voice tells me, leave the shed, its not going to rain for a couple of days (even though i can see dark clouds above), put the laundry and go grocery shopping...  has this happened to anyone? btw i didn't rain for a few days...

2. Coincidences

i had a dream about an uncle who i lost contact with many years ago, i woke up thinking that was more real than real... thought nothing much of it until 2 days later i get by mum, 'Mr X funeral is on Wednesday r.s.v.p.' the mind goes silent.  Was this his soul visiting me in my dream? reminding me of the time spent with him? or was his soul seeking connection now it was spirit? Does this sound familiar.  Has something like this happened to you.  Is it a coincidence?

3. Numbers

i used to get repetitive numbers come up all the time, 109, 11:11 never understood why, just laughed e.g. 6969... then 5yrs later a video came up about how Angels use numbers to connect with mortals as they are unable to speak to us.

So i typed in ""angelic number meaning 1357"" as it was coming up everywhere i went and eventually did scrolled down to the 3rd search (1st search result is what the divine wants you to do and is harsh, 2nd is what the spirit realm would like you to do 3rd is your true gentle meaning, 4th ignore, 5th is better meaning) any way this read..

*'Angel 1357 urges you to listen to natural urges and instincts.  They will give you all sorts of benefits and positivity'*

So i followed them, gave into to my food desires for one day, spoilt myself.... and funny enough i didn't feel starved as i did for the last 2weeks prior.  For the first time in week i slept all night long.  i spoilt myself once everyday but i did feel better inside, not so hungry....

i tested this on a friend, who i would meet every other day, and again she said, how weird i keep waking up at 333 everyday and then go back to sleep.  So we searched it,

*'the universe will do something amazing for you, and a lot of opportunities will appear out of nowhere into your life.  The blessings you are receiving are massive'*

Well she had no money, her boyfriend we found out was cheating on her, her x husband wouldn't leave the house.  Well, in 2 days, we met up, she told me her dad paid the deposit for a new car, she was picking the car up next month, she met another guy, didn't know if anything would come out of it but was meeting him on sat and would i like to go out with her on sat night, her shout, to suss' him out.

Is this normal for you? has something similar happened?

4. Blockages

Sometimes i plan a day to do something nice on my day off...  i end up waiting ages for a bus, then when i reach the train station the trains are cancelled.  i can't tell you the amount of times, i've had to message friends, i can't meet them.  Only to find out days later that the night, whether dinner, drinks or coffee shop was a disaster.

Is this the universe controlling me, preventing me from being hurt? or am i overthinking the situation?  Do you get blockages?

5. Feelings

i get a feeling, a very 100% feeling i'm supposed to go to xyz place and take a gift with me to give.  i shake it off, but the message is clear.  i have to go round to their house, but its a weekday they're both working so i assume, anyway, the feeling is there.... So reluctantly i phone them and say is it oki to come around? They say sure, were ordering an Indian pick you up in 5 mins.  Quickly i get ready and we have dinner round their home, as i leave their place i give the gift, saying that i was guided to give you this to the female of the household, its something i made.  She says thank you... turns out it was her birthday! and was something she was after.  Go figure!

i often end up to uninvited places as a result of these feelings, sometimes special events, one off pop ups, press releases....  often last minute picking up something on the way, which happens to be for someone there...

Is this  my mind picking up bit and pieces of information and somehow stores them for me to use at a later date? and i assume its a feeling?? Please give insights...

there are others signs, i get but am aware this post is getting to long, apologies.

**Conclusion**

in my little bubble i'm guided by these signs and have learnt to follow their guidance, because my path gets blocked, if i don't give them the attention they deserve.  i have felt these signs it seems to have helped me have more purpose in my day to day life outside of work.

Sometimes there is silence, and is unnerving as i feel i don't have a support bubble to guide me.  This usually happens to test if i can do what i'm meant to do on my own, without the 'signs' keeping me on track.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Same-Game Parlay Breakdown: Djokovic vs. Vacherot (Shanghai Masters 2025)**  
*By The ATP’s Most Charismatic Spreadsheet Analyst*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: When a Legend Meets a “Royal” Underdog

Let’s start with the cold, hard numbers. **Novak Djokovic** (-1100 implied probability, per his 1.12 odds at BetUS) is about as likely to lose this match as a coffee addict forgetting to add caffeine to their cup. His bookmakers are so confident in his dominance that they’re giving him **-4.5 games on the spread** at 1.95, which translates to expecting him to win by *at least five games total*. Meanwhile, **Valentin Vacherot** (+600 to +650 implied probability) is the tennis equivalent of a squirrel attempting to play chess against Magnus Carlsen—charming, brave, and destined to learn the meaning of “checkmate.”

The **total games line sits at 21.5**, with even odds on Over/Under. For context, Djokovic’s last match against Zizou Bergs ended in 22 games (6-3, 7-5). If Vacherot’s aggressive three-set upset of Holger Rune (which included a 7-6 tiebreak) is any indication, this match could swing toward the **Over**. But Djokovic’s efficiency—fewer unforced errors, more aces—might keep it tight.

---

### 2. Digest the News: A “Big Three” Legend vs. Monaco’s Royal Comeback Kid

Djokovic enters this match as the ATP’s version of a Swiss watch: precise, reliable, and slightly annoyed when people question its perfection. He just survived a gritty semifinal against Bergs, where he admitted to being “a little too passive.” Translation: *Even Novak gets lazy sometimes, but he still wins like it’s his job.*

Vacherot, meanwhile, is a story out of a Disney movie. The Monaco qualifier, ranked 204th, overcame a six-month injury layoff to stun 10th-seed Holger Rune in three sets. His post-match interview? A mix of disbelief and giddiness: “This is a dream… to play a Big Three member? I’m still waiting for the plot twist.” Spoiler: There is none.

But let’s not低估 the “plot twist.” Vacherot’s game thrives on physicality and unrelenting consistency. He’s the tennis

GH Taipei
HR Amsterdam 
HR Paris Etoile

Great food and beverage options at all of the above.

The views in Paris for breakfast was unbeatable,  Eiffel tower and Arc de Triumph, fresh squeezed oj from machine.  Better than paying 12euro for bread, oj, coffee at a restaurant which we did when we didn't have lounge access first time there.  Hard to save room for pastries when exploring Paris, but we managed.  Wine fridge with self pour button took all my attention, didn't notice the beer.

Amsterdam had great protein during cocktail hour on top of other options.  Alcohol options decent, Heineken and wine. Surprisingly better food than Paris. Breakfast at their restaurant included with lounge access.  Restaurant opens 630ish, lounge 8. Skip lounge for breakfast unless you want peaceful breakfast.

GH Taipei, make your own cocktail.  Can get crowded during cocktail hour, good solid breakfast and can get full at night, but then you're missing out on food in Taiwan. Liquor, wine and beer. They let me liberally pour my liquor.

HR Da Nang.  They make a cocktail of the evening for you and have beer and wine.  Big selection for breakfast and dinner.  Healthy local fresh salads, definitely could eat dinner there every cocktail hour.  The breakfast at the restaurants has bigger options but the lounge is pretty decent too, so if you value calmer environment it's a good option. They make local cafe sua da and other versions of the day, like salt coffee, coconut coffee, etc.

Least favorites any lounge in the US.  Can never redeem my certificate at San Diego.  GH Kauai and HR Maui food is meh, honor bar.  Staff is friendly though, become friends by end of stay.

Same. You're fine. I'm fine. Let's be fine together.

Sick of flakey energy and disappearing acts? Say no more — you’re already in the right place.  
If you're a cynic in LA (or OC) who’s a little disillusioned with humanity but still wants someone to swap memes with at 2am... pull up a chair.

I'm 31, Japanese-American, based in Santa Monica but spending more time in Silverlake lately — and open to meeting people anywhere in the general LA/OC area. I love this city, but let’s be honest: it’s full of performative conversations, influencer vibes, and people who think they’re the next Scorsese. And yet somehow, everyone’s too busy to hold a real conversation.

I’m into:  
**Leather jackets. Tattoos (4, almost 5). 80s & 90s films. Synthwave. Japanese markets. Drawing. Coastal drives. Books. Coffee. Udon.**  
Also possibly getting into **tattooing** and **motorcycling**, because why not.

My humor is **dry, deadpan, and a little dark**, and I love people who can match it — or at least appreciate it.

What I want is a **friend group.** Real friends. The kind that actually reply.  
**Group chats. Inside jokes. Late-night DMs. Brunches we actually show up to. Intentional plans — not “sometime next week” lies.**

You can be male or female, **29–41** — just be a decent human with a little depth, a little edge, and be local!

Message me if this sounds like your kind of friendship.  
Happy to share socials if we vibe.

Let’s get coffee. Or quietly hang out at a zine fest. Or just exist nearby without forcing conversation.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it’s a sacred ritual, and going around the city with my earphones in, imagining I’m in the opening scene of a movie chzz haha. I also enjoy for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, and city lights that feel like they’re winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely! 💯 

Currently, I’m on a mission to shed some pounds —starting with daily brisk w@lks during sunset, which has been refreshing but feels like I’m being chased by regrets (or carbs 😂). I’m considering joining a gym soon, but I believe in taking it one step at a time. I hear having a cute fitness buddy boosts motivation... so, you in? 😉 

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my fun and talkative side 😂

What I’m looking for… A SINGLE guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, respectful, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, 27-35 years old, someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you are:,
- well dressed: clean, stylish, and just the right amount of classy 👌🏻
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a CENOMAR cert when we meet 😂)
- No human kids 
- Christian (genuinely God-fearing)
- Love and/or have dogs
- Enjoy spontaneous long drives
- Can appreciate the charm of bookstores and late-night cafés
- From **Cebu City  or Mandaue City** (easier for coffee dates and spontaneous drives). 

If this sounds like you…
Send me a message and tell me more about yourself such as what do you look like, important aspects in your background, current work, and/or your long-term goals, AND your go-to coffee order too!

Sooo here I am, giving it another shot - hoping luck’s on my side this time! I just want to date seriously for long term 🥺

I’m a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning 🩺). During my days off, I’m probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy café, pretending to “study” but actually people-watching… or getting lost in a book I picked up from a bookstore.

1o3m6q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1o3m6q2/ladies_lets_decide_on_the_best_strategy_to/,"Ladies, let's decide on the best strategy to maximize a Stephen Hawking-esque profile","So, let me start by acknowledging that dating apps are a slog for a lot of people. The convenience of swiping definitely comes at a cost to gaining a deeper understanding of who people are. We're all dealing with the same imperfect interface. Plus, it's oddly tough finding people who might be a good fit. I've come across plenty of people whom I really have no interest in knowing! That's just how it works.

**But** I am someone who likes to figure out a way, and I need an outside perspective on how to do that best. 

I (M45) have an extremely apparent physical disability - think Stephen Hawking without a shred of his scientific prowess :)

I started on Zoosk, then Coffee Meets Bagel, but I finally landed on Facebook Dating, which feels the best so far in terms of potential matches. But all three have yielded zero conversations. 

My photos don't feature me sprawled out in a hospital gown. I'm next to a vineyard, at a poker table, in a cabana, next to the Pacific Ocean, and enjoying my Labrador snuggling on my feet. Still, for most people, the situation overpowers the settings. 

This is the current version of my bio: *First, my dog has a foot fetish, in case it's a deal breaker...😅😋 I'm really a friends-first type. I love iced espresso, silly jokes, fall sports, and people who believe in what’s possible. I get that I’m not the typical right-swipe, but it's okay cause dating apps are weird! Sometimes the best connections come from unexpected people. Friends say I’m smart, loyal, kind, and funny. Others compare me to Stephen Hawking — which should concern you because he got a woman pregnant three times. 😂😂*

That last line still cracks me up! 

There are only two opportunities to tweak the profile, either in the bio or by including images that convey a message rather than a scene (quote, book cover, etc).

Here are my main questions: 1) What would be your initial, visceral concerns related to dating someone who has an uncommon life experience, and 2)  What might be effective ways to address those concerns within the confines of 500 characters and nine images?

Should I use precious characters to literally say ""Not looking for a caregiver, just a special connection!""? Do I need to say that I have a law degree, I've owned a business, I used to be an underwear model (a little humor for those who read this far!)?

Does any of it matter to most people if you obviously can't wipe your own butt? I'm not sensitive about my situation. You can tell me what you think. 

I enter the dating scene with a massive advantage over potential matches because I know it can work. I've had excellent, long relationships where I made my partners' lives better. (Ohh, maybe I should copy/paste that?!).

So what do you think? Let's crack the code. :)",5,1760156409.0,datingoverforty,20,0.73,False

1o3m4ro,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o3m4ro,Said yes to the dress now I feel like throwing up,"I went dress shopping three times last month and I kept thinking about this (first picture) dress. I made three appointments for this weekend at different shops this weekend now that my mom is in town with the hopes of this being my last round of shopping. Today we went to the first shop, and I kept comparing everything to this dress. I wasn’t quite ready to pull the trigger but I am so indecisive and was trying to land on a dress so said yes and ended up putting a deposit down. But after I left, I was, and still am, so worried I made the wrong decision!! I’m literally sick. I always have a very hard time making decisions and almost immediately regret what I choose no matter how small the decision is, so I think that is what is happening, but having already put down a deposit I am just so stressed about this. It’s not like I can just get a different coffee order you know?!

Anyways, the second dress was what I was between. I still love dress one and am pretty sure I made the right decision, I just wish it was clearer for me! Does this happen to everyone?? I almost feel like calling them in the morning to see if I can go back on my deposit so that I can think about it more 😭

Please make me feel better about my decision❤️🥲",14,1760156231.0,weddingdress,17,0.9,False
