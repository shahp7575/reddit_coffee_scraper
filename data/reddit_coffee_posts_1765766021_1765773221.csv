I don’t have a problem with big purchases, rent and bills are always paid on time.

The issue is the small daily stuff.
Coffee, snacks, random online purchases… they don’t feel big in the moment, but at the end of the month I’m always over budget.

I’ve tried tracking my expenses, but I either forget or stop after a few days because it feels overwhelming.

Clearly not careless or intentional damage. 

I contacted our property manager to get it fixed and they are claiming I am responsible for the cost of the repair. My understanding is that this kind of damage was responsibility of landlords to fix as it occurred during normal use and I took reasonable steps to prevent any damage. I know this is somewhat of a grey area about what is considered careless damage in the residential tenancies act. Am I liable for the cost of repairs here or are they in the wrong? I have never have an issues with landlords/property managers fixing and paying for this kind of damage in the past so somewhat surprised. Our property manager attempted to book in a repair without providing any quotes which frustrated me further. 

I would appreciate some clarification around what constitutes careless damage and any advice on what I should do here.

I’m planning a road trip from **Hyderabad to Goa** on **28th December** by car and thought it’d be nice to check if anyone’s heading the same way and would like to join. I’ll be driving my own car — the plan is to leave early morning and reach by evening, with a few pit stops for food, coffee, and pictures along the way.

I’m easygoing, love road trips, and always up for good conversation (and great playlists!). If you’re traveling solo or need a ride/share plan around those dates, **ping me** and we can coordinate the details — route, timings, fuel cost split, etc.

Bonus if you’re also into travel photography or beach chilling once we reach! 😄

1pmy8kv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pmy8kv/aio_feeling_like_my_old_coworker_friend_is/,AIO - Feeling like my old coworker / friend is avoiding me,"I left my job of almost 7 years about four months ago. While there, I became close friends with a coworker, about 5 years ago. We were really close, we shared a lot of our lives, she knows my family now and was in my wedding last year.

When I left, I had given her a heads up before putting in my notice. She said she was obviously sad to not work with me anymore but she was so happy for me (I needed this change) and she would always be my friend and we would have to be so intentional to see each other, etc.

We saw each other the week after I was done and I haven‘t seen her since. I have tried so hard. I have reached out multiple times, inviting her for dinner, offering to bring her dinner, simply go for a walk, grab a cup of coffee, I’ve invited her to group events with mutual friends, and every time there is an excuse or she is suddenly not feeling well. I had a big holiday party this weekend and an hour in she texts me saying she just isn’t feeling well and is tired. I was expecting it at this point, but still disappointed. I’m now going back and realizing there were things I kind of ignored. She didn’t feel well for my bachelorette, had to leave my bridal shower early, she was suddenly sick for my birthday party, and so many other times that things came up (mostly suddenly not feeling well, or being too exhausted).

For extra context, a couple years ago she became a mom. During her pregnancy, she was very snippy and angry. One time my mom and I saw her at the grocery store and my mom asked her how her day was going and she was extremely rude and snippy. But I let it go because i thought, pregnancy is hard, she didn’t feel good, her hormones are really intense right now and she’s going through a big change. We still had good times anyway, and I thought she would go back to her old self after. She kind of did, but the last year I was starting to get nervous to see her because she was so angry everyday. I started taking on extra tasks at work to alleviate her, I tried to talk to our boss about her workload (that didn’t go well at all), I brought her a few meals when she went through a hard time, I was coming in earlier and leaving later but nothing made her feel appreciated or helped her. She was appreciative of the meals but she never really said thank you for working extra. We still had good laughs and things but she was becoming very hateful of our other coworkers and I didn‘t feel like I could ever measure up or work hard enough.

My family thinks I’m overthinking this and she is just a busy mom. But I have other friends who are busy moms (I am not a mom) but they still make time for me and I understand that I’m not the center of their universe. I don’t ask for much, just to hang out maybe once a month for an hour or two. I’m so flexible and want to make this work.

1pmy8aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveAssistants/comments/1pmy8aw/feeling_lost_and_hopeless/,Feeling lost and hopeless.,"I have been an admin/EA for five years. It is a very well paying company with a terrible environment. However, that is its only perk, and my employer simply does not value its employees, but rather sees the company as their personal ATM. It is a smaller company, I am the only female, expected to bring coffee to my boss every morning without so much as a thank you, as if I’m a glorified server to him. 

I do the bookkeeping and pretty much anything else my employer asks of me, including scheduling events and meetings and other typical EA tasks. Without going into too much detail, it is often an unsafe and hostile environment. My employer designed the position so that I am trapped with no room to grow. I work alone, have no colleagues that consider themselves a team, and feel lost all the time. I don’t have anyone I can ask basic questions to, including my employer. My employer does not answer questions, but rather dodges them and takes no accountability as they are a nepo baby who had the keys handed to them with zero prior experience. When I do try to ask them questions, they get frustrated and brush me off because they don’t know the answers either. 

“So why are you still there?” The short answer, money, convenience, and the shit job market. 

My question is, where do I start? What courses should I take? What skills should I improve on? EA is the career path I want to take. 

My title may not be EA at work, but I am certainly an admin with an array of transferable skills and may as well be considered one. I need advice. Please and thank you in advance. ",1,1765772263.0,ExecutiveAssistants,0,1.0,False

1pmxz36,https://v.redd.it/u2g501hdja7g1,Malacca’s Crunchy Legacy To The World,"Julie’s Biscuits is a world-renowned Malaysian snack brand that began its journey in Alor Gajah, Malacca. Founded in 1981 by Su Chin Hock under Perfect Food Industries, the company introduced the Julie’s brand name in 1985 to appeal to international markets. Its logo, featuring a blonde girl, was designed to symbolize friendliness and warmth, helping the brand establish a welcoming identity that resonated with consumers worldwide. Malacca’s rich cultural heritage provided the backdrop for Julie’s rise, blending local craftsmanship with global ambitions.

Among its most iconic products are the Peanut Butter Sandwich biscuits, which quickly became a household favorite across Asia and beyond. Other popular offerings include Love Letters, the crispy wafer rolls often enjoyed during festive seasons like Chinese New Year, as well as sugar crackers and assorted cookies that pair perfectly with coffee or tea. These products helped Julie’s carve out a niche in both domestic and international markets, becoming staples in many households.

Over the years, Julie’s expanded its reach far beyond Malaysia, exporting to more than 80 countries. The company invested heavily in branding, including a multimillion-ringgit global makeover to attract younger consumers and keep pace with changing tastes. Despite its international success, Julie’s has remained rooted in Malacca, proudly showcasing its Malaysian heritage while continuing to innovate for global audiences.

The brand’s journey is filled with interesting milestones. For instance, Julie’s earned its first supermarket entry in 1988 at Parkson Grand in Johor Bahru with its Peanut Butter Sandwiches. The name “Julie” itself was invented by the founder and is not based on a real person, yet it has become synonymous with quality and care. The company emphasizes its motto “Baked with Love,” reflecting its commitment to producing biscuits with attention to detail and passion.

Like many established brands, Julie’s faces challenges in adapting to modern consumer trends. Younger generations are increasingly drawn to healthier snack options, pushing the company to innovate while maintaining its classic favorites. Global competition also requires Julie’s to continually refresh its branding and marketing strategies. Nevertheless, Julie’s Biscuits remains a symbol of Malaysian entrepreneurship and cultural pride, proving that a humble brand from Malacca can win hearts across the world.",4,1765771445.0,Malacca,0,1.0,False

The one good thing I got out of it was that it forced me to customize things I didn't like. For example, I made a tiny cloth coffee bag (bottom left) to replace the plastic on. I used left over wood veneer from another kit for the counter, etc.

Prologue- Jesus spoke these words, lifted up His eyes to heaven, and said: “Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son, that Your Son also may glorify You, 2 as You have given Him authority over all flesh, that He should give eternal life to as many as You have given Him. 3 John 17:1-3 And this is eternal life. 

Daemones regnant the scrawling symbols read on tablets in the basement,

I found it in the old church on top the lectern in an old leatherback book

The front had a sigil.    I opened one of many ripped out pages. Most of it wasn’t legible, the leather read domus carno, I just couldn't figure out what that meant but what was carno, the name popped up in numerous spots. I pocketed the tome, and left the crippled church before anyone saw me.

The ring of Brodger was my next stop on my trip to Ireland. I was only visiting for a few days, 

“Come on, John!” came a yell from the tour bus

We were finally going home after our trip abroad from Spain.

Part 1

(Senile man: “Have the you seen the place of thunder the skies there used to storm the hardest” ,

 He continued his ramble about a place called skara brae. He looked old like he would blow away like pale ash if the breeze was too strong. His voice was croaky, hard to listen to for long.

“ How long ago was that?” I asked

Silence ensued, I looked over to see the old man dozed off, I decided not to wake him, but I really wanted to know more about Skara Brae. 

\[Boo doo\] rang over the speakers!

“Pasangers, we will be landing in Edinburgh in thirty minutes”

(CALL ON YOUR IDOL)

Part 2 

I had been reluctant to open the book further, especially on the bus. I didn't particularly want someone to come up to me and be like, so what's that demonic looking book you got there. Definitely an interaction I wanted to skip. Even in my pocket the book had an allure of overwhelming curiosity, could also be just dumb human curiosity. The same kind of curiosity in horror films, you know the scene where the group looks down a dark hallway and hears a noise, but instead of running they slowly walk into some cheap jumpscare. Yah that was the feeling. I ran my hand down the spine running it along the gruff leathery texture. I was similarly touching the book in the bus. Until a rather pale tall man walked over and sat beside me, the only thing he said was “Call on me when your world weeps for my  return”, I gave him a buggish look as I politely asked him to move. Without a word or breath he just got up and walked right out of the bus. As we passed by him I saw as he continued through the tall grass and off into the distance ahead of me.\` 

(BODIES)

Part 3

The old cobble archways and flower beds strewn through the city, I almost felt like a returning knight from my battlements.

 5th street the old church read on the sign.

I entered Castletown a mere half hour ago, I walked around the lackluster town doing some exploring before my plane had to leave. The main door to the church was closed off, the stones looked as though they would topple and the walls crash down any second. Despite my trepidation I crept along the outside to find a shattered colored pane of glass. “Ah damnit” I yelled out, my shoulder crashed through as I fell onto a pew. This place was certainly old, I thought as I stood, the seats were caked in  dust, and it looks like nothing's been disturbed in centuries. There were many doors leading further in but I strode through one labeled, father carno,  the name drew me more than anything. The stairs led down a long narrow hall that spiralled, I drew my flashlight to cut the darkness before me. It was without description and without mercy to my eyes, stood tall in the center of a study looking room, towering goat like arms, face screaming out small like a child's, it was contorted and skinny. At the base was a book, I saw it labeled….

(LIGHTBULBS)

Part 4

Staring over porcelain skies. Still and hewed colors of blood and autumn swirled about in the heavens. It was the first rain in over a decade. The skies poured like a weeping mother over a lost son. I looked, the whole world might have looked up at that moment. When the  clouds drizzled and poured down red chunks of meat. I ran when I saw it, through the morning it erected higher and higher, dawning the earth in its rotted skin. Pale like a new born and glowing like a dim bulb of light its mass loomed. The streets weeped as it took our sun, replacing it.

(THE RITUAL)

Part 5

\-lest when anyone turns, the foggy veil is lifted. 

“John thank God you're ok”, Her arms wrapped tight around me.

 “What is that thing?”, she said quickly glancing around the street, everything was covered in a thick red epidermis.

 “we will be alright just go inside and dont let anyone in, ill go to the store and get some food”I said trying to comfort her. I woke to heavy gasping and sweat perforating my skin all over. I must have passed out. The lights stopped working but thankfully we had candles. I whispered a soft prayer for the coming rain. The book said it would be pouring. The air was suffocating and smelled like a rotten animal, it threatened to empty my stomach. I couldn't help but stare at it. It calls to me like a fly to the azure purple of death. 

\-set 6 hearts or meat and light the candle. The head of ibis will pull away the divide, and you will see god.  My simple sermon for my children is to remember don't leave the light alone chapter 3.

(IT STARTED WITH 8)

Part 6

Murmuring rang, cold wet sediment rubbed my entire body. The sounds grew louder in slow progression, like chanting more and more picking up to a crescendo.

 “Where was I” The words echoed back,

 I frantically pushed around but the voices chanted on. The words were perfect in sound, not a single note was off pitch, it was hard to not get lost in the rhythmic barrage. The tones shifted, the surfaces I felt were smooth, my confine was humanly sized and rumbling constantly. As the chanting seemed to reach a vocal climax in soulful chant my body convulsed painfully. My ears rang and a head splitting feeling grew in me. I tried to move to get out, fully in sobbing fear of my fate, I reached for my head, no hair was there to pull. The sounds enveloped me, molding me like clay. The shrill sounds I could scream were inhuman , my fingers grew long and wilted. All the sounds stopped. I was left in dark pain, I heard grunting as the lid moved from my prison, men lifted me up from my arms. I was too weak and frail to move. They looked so disappointed. Their sneering faces were the last thing I saw.

(Dysentery)

Part 7

“Time for dinner!” 

Jessica's voice echoed up from the main floor. I passed down the narrow creaking stairs. Her face grinning as she sat at a small round table sipping her coffee. I sat in  the seat across from her. 

“You don't look well, your face is so pale, did you pass out again”? She stood up examining closer, a deep furrow grew on her brow as she studied me. “I'm alright, I just didn't get enough sleep is all”. She shot a deft eye as she sat back down, clearly not believing my lie, but seemed to leave it for the moment. 

“Have you called a repair service yet? The ceiling is still rotting at the corners its started dripping liquid im getting concerned”

 “uhh they said about a week or so, i know its not ideal, ill take a look later. Tho it should hold I hope for the meantime”. I crunched down on a piece of toast golden crust covered with butter glistening brown. I attempted to avoid her gaze while eating. Didn't want her prying, didn't want her asking. I glanced across to see a finished plate and a stern glare like she was peering through me. I gave a sheepish look, “Dont worry ill, sleep when im dead”. I said with a chuckle. The scowl she brandished only sunk deeper, “ If you say so,  but some rest would do you some good”.  “ I'll try,” I replied. A low sigh came after I said that as she led off down the hall with her dishes. I finished my food before retreating back up the stairs into my hovel of a study. I locked the door in paranoiac fear if someone ever came in. The book lay center beside clusters of stacked paper, lit dimly by an adorned lamp with statues of deer holding the bulb up. It called to me with an unholy stench wafting around it. I took a seat before flipping to a book mark buried in the pages, and on I read.

The pure goat shall eat of the impure one in the stable, that day I shall name after him for the unholy shall devour the holy. Dearg-due shall sit on the right sun and Malphas on the left before your father can consume. I shall be your star in the skye by day and I will leave Dearg-due for the night. Come to the altar and lay yourself down. I will find you in the skinless canopy, you will find me through your blood.

(The end)

part 8

“You can’t leave me I own you know” it boomed throughout the field. “No ,no please let go of her”. I begged screaming, I watched as she died shuttered at her screams. The cries and whimpering echoed out from a large hemorrhoid hanging from its side. “You can’t run boy” I could only watch as it melted away. I stared out motionless,  tears cold down my cheek laying in my own piss and shit. The fumes teasing out more vomit, it came to me then, my eyes slowly shut to lay in the bowl as I imagined the fate of my sister would be mine to bear as well. The large hand lifted me up. I felt it, I felt my liquids falling rolling off me to be laid in the cold wet. 

I drew out of my stupor heaving, brow soaks on the desk. It was just a dream I thought to myself. The hallway was dim but it was day as I peered out the flapping crack of the drapes, even the sky was dim. “Jessica” I called out down the stairs, no response. I walked down the hall to the back door through the 

Pane I saw her staring up. I opened the door and stepped out, the hair on my neck stood up as I joined her gaze upward into the heavens. A mass grew and shifted in the sky far up touching the sun. “How long has that been up there?” Obvious concerns dressing my tone. No response, her expression slack as it rolled through the sky. It looked twice the size of the sun and seemed to be growing endlessly, Carnus is all she said before she fell over. I lunged over trying to catch her descent but I was too late, she was vomiting as I cradled her on the creaking boards “were gonna get help I promise” I said laying her up.  I ran inside to the nearest phone Dialed 911, it just rang. I tried again and again running back out to the porch she slumped over more vomit and bile spilling out. I sat there with her eyes rolled back  and cold wrists, the phone just rang ,but nothing went through. I weeped over her lifeless body. She was what I had left of my Older sister, just gone. I cleared my eyes. I could barely see now the lights in the sky were ever dimmer. I looked at where the sun had been, only a faint disk of light protruded the sky now. I took her body inside, cleaned her up and laid her on the main floor bed. “I'm so sorry” came out wispy and breathless, so I shut the door. With the small amount of candle I had left I walked upstairs finding the phone now completely not working the same as the car had been. 

(Submersus)

part 9

It was there, right where I had sat it on my chair in the corner of the room. The book held ominously open. I walked over feeling  the book was warm and dripping with, “ugh” something it was flipped to the last chapter, every time I picked it up I'd just pass out to a random page. The same sickening sleep felt neer.

 The bearer will open  up to let it take hold of a new frontier, it feeds off the trees, feeds off the ground and those that tend to it. Alo humus, thy will not perish but acclimate to her,mold to her, be her. And on the seventh day you will rest in her.

(Walk with your God)

I woke up on the cold floor and the feeling was all too familiar now.“Hello” I called out into the dark,  I couldn't see my hand or anything really, but that stench. It penetrated my senses and pores filled with a rotting acid smell. Where I was laying a sticky wet filament seemed to cling to me weekly. I stood up baring above the oily stuff. Stumbling through what I thought was the hall was difficult, every floorboard felt like a slip'n'slide, the walls were still dry at least. I made it to the front door by feel. It cracked open with no effort. “Can anyone hear me?” I screamed with every ounce of fear coating my throat. My words echoed and led a cavernous undulating sound.

1pmxv1h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pmxv1h,Starting my first micro SaaS in 2025 — this sub has been huge inspiration! Question: How did you all get your first users?,"Hey everyone! I'm Tiffany, building this with my good friend Caro.

Coming across r/microsaas and seeing all the cool, focused tools people are shipping has been incredibly motivating. From Notion-style apps to niche AI helpers, **it's proof that we can really start from zero and create something people need**. So here goes — sharing our first project: [ChatJump](https://chatjump.org/).

**ChatJump** is a Chrome extension that addresses a specific pain point for heavy ChatGPT users: losing track in lengthy conversations.   
It adds a sidebar navigator so you can click any title and jump straight to that part — no more endless scrolling. The MVP is almost ready and is expected to be live on the Chrome Web Store by late December or early January.

Before launch, I'd love to have your thoughts on a few early-stage questions:

1. How did you start acquiring users in the MVP phase?
2. Did you begin collecting potential users (waitlist, pre-orders, etc.) before the product was fully ready?
3. For a small tool that solves a single pain point like ours, do you think the potential is big enough?

Really looking forward to hearing your experiences — this sub has already given us so much inspiration!

Thanks everyone!",1,1765771098.0,microsaas,0,1.0,False
1pmxukz,https://www.reddit.com/r/tinnitus/comments/1pmxukz/my_tinnitus_is_80_resolved_i_am_sharing_what/,"My tinnitus is 80% resolved, I am sharing what happened","**Tinnitus for \~25 years (since age 6), my tinnitus is PERMANENTLY at what is now 80% resolution.**

# My personal scale

* **0** – none
* **1** – only if I focus quite hard on it
* **2** – notice it at points throughout the day without consent
* **5** – loud enough to be EVER-present, but not enough to stop me from hearing things.
* **7** – as loud as my professor in class, I had to focus to hear him.
* **10** – the noise you get after blacking out / sudden lightheadedness (basically a mosquito right in your ear)

For a long time, I was around a **5** on average. At worst I was a **7.**

Right now, I’m about a **1.5**.

# Things I’ve tried:

I’ve been at this for years and experimented heavily. This includes:

* Brian Johnson–style diet
* \~100 different supplements
* Balancing minerals
* Megadosing vitamin C, D, and basically every mineral known to man
* NAC, all the GABA-related stuff
* Meditation
* Yoga
* Waiting
* Raw veganism (**please do not do this**)
* Fruitarianism (**please do not do this — but doubly so**)
* The gym
* Saunas
* Earwax cleansing
* The “finger on the back of your head” trick
* YouTube high-pitched tinnitus videos
   * (Great for reminding you what life *isn’t* like, it totally worked for me for like 3 hours)

# What actually helped

To keep a long story short:

In early 2025, while recovering from a raw vegan diet, I cut out \~90% of vegetables and shifted to a **mostly animal-based diet**.

Since then:

* A lot of things in my body started healing, I won't get into that all
* Overall inflammation has steadily reduced - leading to ->
* **TMJ is \~60% improved (jaw is much less tight) I used to have to practice opening my jaw for 20 minutes every morning because it hurt so bad. I literally could not open my mouth all the way.**
* **Tinnitus is \~80% improved (yay)**

# What I eat now:

* Organs
* Eggs
* Cheese
* Milk / dairy
* Steak
* Butter
* Whatever I’m in the mood for
* Tons of fruit (I love sugar and carbs)
* I still eat normal food like dough and carrots and whatnot because I dine out a lot, and my family is italian, but way, way less. And I am starting to really not like it.

# What I almost never eat now:

* Straight poison (fried foods)
* vegetables - especially ones that taste bad (again, broccoli)
* coffee
* straight sugar (I will just pour a big glass of juice. I don't know if this matters, I just like juice and it's more natural)

If I don’t like something, I spit it out. Sorry broccoli.

I cook my meat very lightly or sometimes not at all, no I am not going to harp on about how much you should or shouldn't cook your food, I just choose not to.

No I am not super strict. You could call me 80% animal based, 40% raw.

Some of you may call me a giant baby for not eating broccoli.

Well, I can also sleep at night.

Just posting this to get it out there in case it helps someone.

Going from a 6 to a 1.5 took about 9 months. I fully expect to be at a 1 or better by the end of next year and essentially to be tinnitus-free. If anybody later reads this and pings me in many  months, I will definitely come back and make another post or dm you if you want to know how it's going.

I had completely given up on fixing tinnitus (I gave up years ago), and did this for other issues (extreme fatigue from my previous diet, drug use). It appears that a massive influx of proteins, fats, and vitamins (from organs) is continually helping.",4,1765771055.0,tinnitus,4,0.67,False
1pmxsx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1pmxsx2/how_do_you_let_an_autistic_man_know_youre/,How do you let an autistic man know you’re interested?,"There’s a guy I like. I kind of think he likes me but my attempts at expressing my interest went over his head. I’m autistic myself, and I’m also a little oblivious to romantic interest but not quite to that degree. I’m also really shy.

It took me every last ounce of courage I had to ask him out for coffee and I mean that. Only for him to not realize that it was supposed to be a date.

On one hand I’m relieved because if I’m misreading him and he’s not into me that way it could potentially destroy our entire friend group.

I’ve had that happen before when I liked a guy and he found out about it, blocked me the next day then most of our mutual friends stopped talking to me because he was kind of the leader of the group and if he chose to no longer associate with somebody they followed his lead. I don’t want something like that to happen again.

I don’t think he’s that immature. He seems like a genuinely kind person and a deep thinker, which is one of the things I like about him. However, I’m at loss of what to do now.

I kind of act aloof around him as I do with most people. It’s a habit because I assume most people don’t want to be bothered with my company and find me an annoyance. I avoid speaking much around other people, seldom initiate conversations and feel stupid when I do, and usually stand pretty far back from them even if we are having a conversation because I don’t want to be a pest.

People also describe me as stoic and difficult to read, even a bit of an ice queen. This is surprising to me because I always thought of myself as embarrassingly over emotional and overly friendly. I guess I’m better at hiding my feelings than I thought and now I don’t know how to unhide them.

Expressing interest in someone, even if it’s in a purely platonic way is scary because I feel like I’ll just annoy the person or make them uncomfortable.

On the other hand, if I don’t make the move, someone else who is better at expressing their feelings will. He’s got his fair share of admirers but seems unaware of it.

I know it’s not because he’s disinterested in dating. He’s told me himself he’s looking for a committed relationship. He’s just genuinely that unaware of the effect he has on people to the point that it’s a little exasperating.

He thinks people think he’s weird when that isn’t the case at all.  He can be awkward and seems a bit anxious but he’s not a weirdo and people don’t dislike him nearly as much as he seems to think they do.

If he does like me, I want to let him know I like him back but I don’t know how. What can I do at this point?",2,1765770904.0,autism,5,1.0,False

1pmxlt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pmxlt5/10_minutes_til_i_die/,10 minutes ’til I die,"“10 minutes.” The text arrived from an unknown number.

*What the hell?* I thought, balancing the cup of coffee in my left hand and my phone in the other.

The time was just shy of 7 am. It was the early morning commute in one of the biggest cities in America. My boss was waiting…

I dashed past the pawn shop. Stopped at a busy street corner. Cars whirred by, oblivious to us pedestrians.

“Don’t forget my latte!” Mrs. Platt had screamed at me the other day. “And don’t be late!”

*I’ll do my best,* I’d thought.

“9 minutes.”

*Huh?*

I ignored the text, waited for the crosswalk to change. *Why’d the cafe have to be so far away?!*

“R u coming?” A co-worker, Ben, messaged me.

“Yes. Almost there.”

The person next to me sneezed and I glanced up at the office building… only a few blocks away.

*Come on, crosswalk! Change!*

“8 minutes.”

*Seriously?!* “Who is this?”

“Your guardian angel. ;)”

“Leave me alone!” I blocked the number, stepped into the street as the crosswalk changed. I reached the opposite sidewalk.

Up ahead, the glittering tower of ***** Wealth Management awaited me. I’d worked so hard to secure this position. Platt was one of the wealthiest investment bankers in all of America. If I succeeded in this role, I could get a job anywhere.

I made it to the revolving doors, waved to the security guard.

“Morning, Moe.”

“Morning, Triss.”

*I like Moe. He’s nice to me.*

I stepped into the lobby. A mob of stressed-out PAs and interns filtered past, each desperate to prove their worth.

“5 minutes.” My phone buzzed.

*Damn bots…* My thumbs raced across the screen. “Stop texting me or I’ll call the police!”

I filed through the metal detector and progressed toward the elevators. It was like cutting through Tokyo traffic.

“Triss!” A voice hissed behind me.

I turned to see Ben, the resident East-coaster who had always managed to talk down to me.

“What’s taking you?”

“I got held up at the cafe.” He reached for the drink, but I stepped back. “I’ll bring it up.”

“Better do it quick. She’s about to start her meeting.”

*Ding.* Another text. “Time’s almost up.”

*Who is this?!*

I was so confused. If this was a scammer, how were they able to message me after I’d blocked their number?

“Everything okay?” Ben prodded.

“Yeah… I just keep getting these weird messages. I think someone’s hacked my phone.”

“Better figure that out. If your phone goes off in our meeting, Platt’ll kill you.”

I blocked the new number and followed Ben to the elevators. I wondered if one of the interns was the culprit. There were a few I recognized from casual visits at the bar. There was Paul, the transplant from Wisconsin. And Dessi, the overachiever from Harvard. But they didn’t know me enough to harass me, right?

*Ding.* The elevator arrow lit up and a collective sigh exited our lungs.

Another text.

“Get on your knees… right now…”

*What?*

“Do it… or die…”

I swiveled my gaze. About twenty of us were packed together, desperate to pile into the approaching elevator.

One of the interns, Vanessa, who I’d gone out with, eyed her phone, then looked up fearfully and knelt.

I wasn’t sure why, but out of instinct, I did the same. There was something about seeing her fulfill that action that compelled me to obey.

I didn’t even look up when I heard the first scream.

***

I still don’t know what happened. But when the elevator doors opened, something came out.

“Jesus!” “What the hell?!” “Ahh!”

I fell flat as bodies stampeded me. A woman’s heel bit into the back of my hand. A man’s knee collided into my spine. I gasped, feeling my bones crack as bodies trampled over me.

There was a gunshot. A loud squeal. And a thump.

I opened my eyes to see Moe, the security guard, white-knuckling his gun. Horror etched onto his face.

“My god… what… is that…”

Piled among the bodies was a bat-like creature, drenched in blood. Long incisor-like teeth jutted from its gaping mouth.

“You hurt?” He asked, pulling me up.

“No…” I wiped blood from my brow. “At least… I don’t think so…”

Another *ding* alerted me to my phone.

I’m a 32 year old guy in San Diego looking for a female chat buddy who enjoys easy conversation, friendly banter, and getting to know someone beyond small talk. I have been in SD for about a year now and I love it here. It would be awesome to meet fellow San Diegans, but if you are from somewhere else that is totally fine too.



A few things about me:



I am the kind of person who loves learning how things work and I enjoy talking to people who are curious about the world.



Outside of work, I am usually gaming, taking photos, or hanging out with my two cats. I go fishing when I can, I catch shows around the city, and I am always searching for a new coffee spot to try. I drink my coffee black most days, but once fall hits I am absolutely ordering something pumpkin flavored.



I am a big movie person. I am into anything from Pixar, Nolan, Spielberg, Anderson, Hitchcock, Kubrick, or Tarantino (and of course I love Finding Nemo). When it comes to TV, I bounce between sci fi, dumb reality shows, classic cartoons, and adult cartoons. Think Firefly, Westworld, The Expanse, Looney Tunes, Rick and Morty, South Park, Smiling Friends.



I like plants, I drive a stick shift, and I enjoy a good steak dinner. Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday and there is no chance of convincing me otherwise.



If you are thinking about messaging me, here are a few easy ways to start the conversation:



• Tell me about your favorite band or show

• Tell me your go-to coffee order

• Tell me something small that made your day better

• Or just introduce me to your pets.

My aunt usually asks me to bring her stuff from the US - usually coffee, chocolate, and ziplock bags with a slider (kind of like a proper zipper). Will I have any issue bringing these things in? Have any rules changed?

Last time I came to Romania was during the winter of 2016-2017. I had a layover in Paris. No one asked me any questions neither in Paris not at Otopeni and I was able to bring my aunt chocolate, coffee, and ziplock bags. I went through customs at the Otopeni airport and the employees were very bored and disinterested in anything and anyone. I think I was only asked about the purpose of my visit before I was gestured away. The border agent didn't even say hello it goodbye. The guy spoke less than 10 words to me.

I woke up to a violent scream. An annoyingly loud, painful scream. That scream, of course, coming from me as my left leg sat comfortably at a ninety-degree angle. I’d never really felt pain like that; a pain that makes it seem like it would’ve been better waking up to my leg simply chopped off instead. My stomach had been cut by the boards, so I was bleeding onto the floor a little. I tried to slide around or make any movement but all I could feel was my knee touching the ground in a way I definitely shouldn’t be feeling it do that. All in all, I felt pretty screwed.

I looked around to find some way out, but it was too dark to really tell. It seemed like a basement, but I had lived in this house for years and it never had a basement. At least, not a basement my dad had ever mentioned. The only bit of light I had was coming from the hole that I made falling through the stairs. I reached for my phone and painfully pulled it out of my pocket. Turning on the flashlight, I could make out more of the room. A square cement room with mildew stains, completely empty with one closed wooden door. I couldn’t get a call out and my battery was quickly dying so I decided the only way out was hopefully wherever that door led. I ignored the pain as best I could and got onto my stomach. 

The floor felt damp as I baby crawled my way across the room and I couldn’t get the smell of ash out of my nose. It felt like an hour before I reached the door. I could make out some scratches at the bottom almost like someone had already clawed their way out of this room. It did help to open the door from the ground, the actual door had no knob to it, so it just took a good few pulls to get it to scrape against the floor. Once I got the door open enough for me to squeeze through, I kept pushing myself along the floor by the door frame and was able to make it halfway through a hallway before I needed a break. 

I turned on the flashlight again and could see where the hallway ended. Another doorway. It wasn’t that far away, but my flashlight couldn’t light the room it led into at all. A pitch-black room. I took a breather before pushing myself down the hallway again. My head was pounding and I could feel my body giving up, the pain feeling more unbearable by every second. The floor got colder as I got closer, the smell of ash got stronger and the room I was crawling into only seemed to get darker. 

My eyes felt heavier once I passed the doorway; I could almost make out a noise. A quiet hum. It felt nice, almost made the pain ease as I went deeper into the darkroom. What was that feeling? Like a hushing lullaby that only got louder the more my body shut down. I couldn’t push any farther, I didn’t want to be left down there and forgotten about. Dying in the grungy basement of an insane man, the only woman I’d ever loved moved on and only being with me in my memories, the idea of an easier life being brought down by my own stupidity and my trust in this house to bring it to me. I started to cry. I don’t know, at that point I thought I couldn’t cry, but there I was sobbing into a cement floor. Mom. I wanted my mom. Whoever that was, hopefully how she seemed when my father described her. To imagine a love, I’d never gotten and to think it would make everything better. Fuck, I felt stupid. 

I started wailing and screaming for help; screaming like a kid that scraped their knee. It felt like the room was getting darker by the second. I tried to reach for my phone, but it was so dark I couldn’t even see my own hands anymore. I didn’t know what was happening to me, what I had gotten myself into. I thought of Lila; how simple things were when all I needed was her. I blacked out after that. Maybe it was from all the pain, maybe it was from the lack of sleep and desperation, maybe it was from the pale white arms I started to see growing in the depths of the dark room. Either way, something caused me to go out. 

I could feel warm sunlight, the glow shining slightly through my eyelids. The smell of ash had transformed into the smell of a freshly cleaned house and fresh cinnamon rolls. I could hear the clutter of dishes being washed and it made me open my eyes. I was back in the living room somehow, laying on the couch I never bothered to sit on. It never felt comfortable, but right then it felt like the softest cushion I’d ever felt. How did I get back up? Who was in the kitchen? “Hello?” I called out. My voice was raspy, and my throat felt dry. I hadn’t realized how long it had been since I’d really spoken. 

I could pick myself up enough to sit upright on the couch. The pain was still faint, and the memory of my collapsed leg was still fresh in my mind, but my knee was back to normal. Same thing for my sides. I looked down at myself and noticed my fresh and clean looking clothes, although when I smelled them enough I could still get a whiff of mildew and ash. “Don’t get up, honey. I’ll be there in just a second.” The voice of a woman came from the kitchen. I listened and sat still on the couch and a few minutes later she came into the room. 

A familiar face carrying a plate of cinnamon rolls and a glass of milk. All I could make was confused, “Cinnamon rolls?” as she set them down on the coffee table in front of me. She smiled and took a seat on the couch while humming quietly. I looked at her face. Whatever stranger she was, she was a familiar one. I think she could see the confusion on my face as she wrapped an arm around my shoulders. She gave me a peck on my forehead, “You’re okay now, hon.” She kept humming. I thought back to my dad’s stories, where I had heard that song before. It was my dad’s favorite song that he used to sing to me when I was younger. I wrapped my arms around her tentatively and after my heart stopped nearly beating out of my chest, I let out one word. “Mom?” She smiled at me as if she’d been waiting forever to hear such a word. “Not just me. Your dad will be home soon.”",1,1765769108.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1pmx6s4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pmx6s4,Smoked Pineapple Amaro,"About 6 months ago u/-phototrope posted their pineapple amaro (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amaro/comments/1lfp98e/pineapple_amaro/) and I knew I had to give it a try. I sat on it for a little while because the nerd in me was not going to let me follow a recipe based on volume for ingredients that could come in all shapes and sizes. No shade intended to the original recipe - 'tis I who struggles. Then about 2 months ago u/-m14c- swooped in to save the day and posted their interpretation of the recipe with weights (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amaro/comments/1obrv35/pineapple_amaro_uphototrope/). This was my sign to follow through.

It just happened that I was firing up the egg to smoke some chicken wings and thought ""hmmm…smoked pineapple"" and proceeded to smoke the pineapple for ~2h at 225F (107C) on charcoal, apple and pecan. This was after cutting it into ~3""x3"" (75mmx75mm) chunks.

Recipe:
	• 2.0g quassia.
	• 6.3g dried orange peel.
	• 3.3g gentian.
	• 4.5g cinnamon.
	• 1.8g allspice.
	• 2.0g dried ginger. 
	• 3 whole cloves.
	• 3 cardamon pods.
	• 4 black peppercorns.
	• 823g smoked pineapple
	• 750mL 151 proof Everclear
	• I left it to macerate for 4 weeks (2 weeks longer than intended - life got busy).
	• Strained through a colander and then through a metallic coffee filter a few times (that was the extent of the clarification).
	• 590.7mL water added for dilution. Based on some assumptions that the maceration pulled some water out of the pineapple (I forgot to weight the pineapple after maceration) and some maths I figure this to be around 38-40% ABV.
	• 243.6g white sugar (I did not want to use a dark sugar and alter the color) dissolved directly into the Amaro at room temperature by just mixing (no heat). This resulted in 18g/100mL of added sugar. I tried to keep it low knowing that the maceration step pulled a bunch of sugar out of the pineapple. I would likely go lower next time - maybe 15g/100mL.

This turned out to be a very tasty recipe. You get the smoke on the nose and the palate and it is very pleasant. Smoke may not be for everyone but being a fan of Islay Scotch, Mezcal, and Rauchbier this lines up nicely with my tastes. I also kept a small bottle undiluted and non-sweetened to use as a cocktail bitter.

Thanks to u/-phototrope and u/-m14c- for putting in the work and sharing their recipe / experience.

1pmx69u,https://i.redd.it/m475xx3lda7g1.jpeg,"The ""Holy Grail"" of The SUNDAYS memorabilia.","This is an officially licensed piano/vocal/guitar songbook for *Reading, Writing and Arithmetic*, produced circa 1990–1991, at the height of the album’s initial success. Most bands at their popularity level never got *any* songbook at all — the fact that one exists is amazing in itself. The Sundays are beloved, but they weren’t a band with endless product tie-ins (short discography, low publicity footprint, minimal touring, etc.) That matters because songbooks get reprinted when there’s ongoing mass demand—and there just wasn’t.

The Sundays’ debut was originally released in the UK on Rough Trade, and Rough Trade’s early ’90s collapse caused all kinds of disruption in availability and distribution. Stuff from that moment often just disappears from the supply chain and never gets re-ordered. That’s how “rare” happens in real life: not dramatic, just—gone.

Vinyl gets archived, but songbooks get written in, bent, coffee spilled on them, you name it. Almost nobody in 1990 was thinking “this will be a collectible someday.” The print run was small enough, but the *survival rate* is almost nil. A lot of rare music ephemera becomes less rare when it gets reissued, digitized, anthologized, etc. This didn’t. The supply is frozen in time.

It’s been rumored that after the Rough Trade label folded, remaining copies were intentionally destroyed. It’s common in publishing that unsold stock gets remaindered, returned, or even pulped as a routine business decision — and nobody writes a press release about it. So it is plausible, given that you can’t even find this book for sale anywhere.

So how rare are we talking? I’m not going to throw out a confident number because I don’t have printer records, but based on how seldom it shows up for sale, even on niche sites, and how rarely collectors even mention owning it. Not to mention how ephemeral printed music is compared to records… it’s reasonable to assume it was a limited run, likely never widely reprinted, and that clean surviving copies are genuinely rare enough that most fans will never see one in person. A real shame, but I definitely covet mine, it's in amazing condition, and I’ll continue to keep it protected.",9,1765768958.0,TheSundays,0,0.91,False

I’m a bit introverted at first, but once I’m comfortable I open up, talk more, and stay loyal. I’m not into games or drama. I prefer connections that grow slowly and feel stable.

Most days end with coffee, soft music, and a show I’m probably overthinking 😅. I enjoy anime and K-dramas (Naruto and Demon Slayer are favorites), Turkish shows, and story-based movies. Music is important to me, especially late-night playlists and sharing random songs.

I like cooking foods, quiet walks, hiking, stargazing, museums, cafés, and relaxed weekends at home. I still play Genshin sometimes. I enjoy travelling too. Japan and Switzerland are dream places, but I’m also happy staying in and talking about life.

I’m looking for someone kind, emotionally open, and steady. Long distance is okay if both people put in effort. If it feels right, I’m open to closing the gap.

Redbull has 80 mg of caffeine per 8.6 oz aka 9.3 mg per oz

Coffee has 11.6 to 17mg of caffeine per oz

RedBull has taurine, which is linked to various health benefits, including increasing life span, muscle growth, and heart health. Coffee does not. Edit: Black Coffee does have antioxidants which are better proven than my taurine claims.

So why do people have this stigma about redbull?

1. Coffee is more widely accepted, and has been around longer
2. Cases of redbull causing heart attacks are blown out of proportion. You shouldn't have 12 redbulls, nor should you have 12 cups of coffee. Common sense and moderation is key.
3. Edit: Coffee has culture and history that is very cool. energydrinkshops dont exist for a reason.

Also, if you drink normal redbull, consider switching to sugar free as to avoid sugar crash :)

thanks for reading my rant k bai

Editing opinion: I believe redbull and coffee are both good in moderation, don't overdo it and you should be good. my main rant was about how redbull is so 'unhealthy' and trying to debunk it. I also am very good at making mistakes, make sure to correct my claims if you see any problems

I started studying for the GRE towards the end of August and wish I would’ve optimized my studying earlier. But hey we don’t know what we don’t know, so hopefully people will be able to get some value out of this. 

My background: Cybersecurity undergrad from an online school, I haven’t done anything math related in years. I’m not smart but I try hard. I forget what my exact score was for my first ETS practice test was but it was something heinous like 145v/150q. I’m fortunate to be able to study up to 12 hours a day since I’m not working at the moment, but I definitely wasted time early on studying the wrong things. I only used the ETS power pack books up until my first GRE attempt in mid October which was 153v/159q. After that I decided to get my shit together and became willing to try anything to get me a higher score. I enrolled in Gregmat with prepswift and found it very valuable because of all the videos where he’ll break down all of the problems from quizzes. For the price you can’t beat it. It’s not perfect though, it can be glitchy for example if you fat finger while using the calculator on a practice test it will just crash and you’ll start from the beginning without saving any of your work. It’s pretty annoying but hey for $12 a month or whatever it is I was impressed. 

A couple other things I did early on was vocabulary podcasts. Nick Nordstrom has a great series on Spotify for GRE words that is awesome to listen to when you’re driving but still want to be engaged. Once I started using Gregmat though I started playing their vocab lists in the car to try to be as productive as I could be. Additionally I downloaded this vocabulary app so that I would get new words on my phone lock screen. 

I also hired a tutor around the beginning of November. Ed is the man! He’s affordable and he was very good at steering me in the right direction. I foolishly put my phone number on varsity’s website, and ended up getting spammed relentlessly by them for a few weeks. I haven’t heard great things about them, and they’re expensive. I ended up using the manhattan 5 pound book as well, their building block approach was very helpful for me. About two weeks before my second attempt I ended up taking just about every free practice test out there: the ETS one, Manhattan, Princeton review, Kaplan, all three of Gregmats, and then I paid for another ETS one two days before my exam. 

Additionally I started taking functional mushrooms every day. Ive been using lions mane extract daily with coffee and it’s been a game changer. I suffered a brain injury last summer so my focus was decently impaired. The week before the test I added cordyceps and alpha brain. Along with 10mg of creatine daily. They could be placebos but I feel like they helped. Effective placebos nonetheless. 

I would definitely leave more time to study than you think you’ll need. Once you unlock the hard version of verbal and quant for the latter sections you’ll notice that those questions are unlike anything you’ve probably been preparing with. As Ed puts it, it just takes time to practice with questions in a low oxygen environment. I didn’t get the hard second section portions for the first time on practice tests until about two weeks ago. 

I’m planning on taking it one more time right before the R2 deadline, but will have to shift my focus to applications now. Getting this score is a relief, but I think I can do better. If you are like me and was discouraged early on don’t be, I think just dialing in how you study is more important than how much you study. The GRE is very much a critical thinking test, and developing a personal testing strategy is crucial to doing well imo. Again, this is targeted to us mere mortals and not all the demigods on here ;) best of luck!!!!!",3,1765768474.0,GRE,4,1.0,False

Well, I’ve got two listening ears (and reading eyes) and would love to chat with you. Looking to make new friends and connections for long term friendships, no nsfw.

About me: East asian introvert Interests: Netflix, youtube, manga, cooking, food, coffee, drinks, video games, true crime, crunching numbers and watching the stock markets Music wise - I enjoy a wide mix, mostly older songs from the 90s to 00s Boybands like Westlife, BSB, NSYNC; MLTR, Greenday, Simple Plan, Coldplay; even ranging to Taylor Swift, Bieber, and EDM.
Been playing Where Winds Meet recently and enjoying it - would be cool if you’re playing too!

Petite, slim, and small, but don’t hesitate even if you’re tall. Close to my age, and 18+ only please. Similar interests, talkative and fun, and can hold a conversation - not a fan of one word responses. Looking for a long term online companion as well.

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:

I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is; the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other. I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living anywhere)
* 23–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me:

You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

* One thing you’d love to do together on a lazy Sunday
* Where you are right now (city/prefecture in Japan, or US city)
* One question for me

My CV consists of over 4 years of working in marketing teams in Montreal, Berlin, Hamburg, and freelancing as a content creator for a small company in London. (I also tried to build my own small marketing agency but got screwed over by my partner...)

Since May I haven't been able to find a job...and I'm honestly so sad, and my confidence and ego have hit rock bottom. 

I'm an intelligent person, I work incredibly hard, I'm disciplined, speak 3 languages, I won awards in high school, was on the honour roll in college and graduated from one of the best universities in Canada...and I can't find a job that even pays 45k a year...

I'm currently completing a Graduate certificate in advanced marketing (courses are in the evening, so I am fully available to work during the day), and I've been applying to over 100 jobs and don't ever hear anything back....or just keep on getting rejection emails...

I've even tried applying to minimum wage jobs in calling centers, and it seems like I am getting denied, probably because they see I'm overqualified...

I'm so unmotivated, I'm heartbroken from the job market, and from all the emails of rejection I keep getting...

I'm in desperate need of work, but I don't want to work in retail or a minimum wage crappy job at McDonald's type thing...I really can't do that. My ego can't handle it. And also I want to work in a job where I will learn new skills, grow, and develop corporate knowledge...I don't want to just work in a coffee shop or retail store...

I'm so damn hurt... </3

(I'm looking into master's degrees in Europe, because I'm telling myself maybe if I get a master's it will help me find a job since I clearly can't find one now....) 

But even then...I feel like I'm still going to be stuck and won't be able to find anything if I get a masters in marketing/sociology/stats/data analysis

Gear up. Off to the gas station for coffee and smokes. The women in there were very kind. The wind, not so much. Hung out for half an hour. Saw traffic picking up so I headed for the ramp.

Gear down. Thumb out. The last of my coffee in hand. 

Maybe half an hour later a young, super skinny woman stopped. ""Where ya headed?"" ""South down the 81."" ""I'm going to Harrisonburg."" ""That'd be awesome!"" ""Hop in.""

Gear in. Me in. Introduce myself. Brief chit-chat. She's got a lead foot. I don't think the term 'speed limit' was in her vocabulary. She drove safe. But fast.

She dropped me at sheetz about five miles north of town. I give her my heartfelt thanks and head inside. 

Phone charging. Breakfast bagel secured. I know the temperature is supposed to drop all day. It never got any warmer than when I woke up. I check the weather. It's cold and getting colder. I'm hoping to make it far south out of this cold today...

Phone in pocket. Charger in pack. Gear up. Out to the ramp. Gear down. Thumb out. 

It's fuckin' cold!!! The wind is gusting to thirty degrees. Coming from the north. I've got hand warmers in my shoes and my gloves. I'm rotating in the sun trying to keep warm. It's not happening. 'All part of the ride' I tell myself with a smile.

Some waves. Lots of confused stares. One hour. Two hours. 'Fuck it's cold.' 'Hey wind, that's enough!' Steady temperature drop.

I decide to go pretty far down the ramp to get some trees between me and the wind. It helps a little, but not much.

Three hours. I can't feel my hands. My legs are frozen. It's going from bad to worse quick. 

Four hours in... 'Fuck this. No sense being stupid. I'm out.' Gear up. I walk past sheetz to Pilot.

Inside. Find the truckers lounge. Not much of one, but there's seats, and I can charge my phone.

And it's warm!

Check weather. The 'feels like' is gonna be zero degrees in the valleys. Minus ten on the ridges. I have more appropriate gear than I had last winter, but I'm definitely not setup for this.

Throw a post on reddit looking to see if anyone's got a spot I can crash in the area. I get a message pretty quick. ""I can sort you out. If you're close we can meet in person."" ""I'm at the pilot north of town."" ""Bet. I'll sort you out. Take your post down so they don't ban you.""

I'm not begging for money. I'm just looking for a place to crash, so I leave it up. Also, I've been around the block a few times. I don't believe anything someone tells me until it happens.

An hour goes by. 'No worries. Dude probably has stuff to do. Can't expect someone to rearrange their life in a few minutes.' 

Half an hour later, still nothing. Another kind redditor comments he can get me a room. ""Let's hold off and see if this other guy comes through. I'll get a hold of you if it falls through...""

I send a message to person number one. Wait about half an hour. Radio silence.

I get back to the other guy with some details. Boom! Room booked. My profuse thanks. Get my route on maps. Gear up. Out the door.

The sun has set. It's getting dark. There's nowhere to walk on this road. There's no street lights. I'm out in the country. I've got 4.2 miles to walk. The wind is howling! 

About three-qurters of the way there I stop to rest. Take a drink of water.

My water jug is frozen inside and out. The cap is frozen shut. I break it lose, bang on the jug. Get a much needed drink. On down the road...

Cut through Lowe's. Down the final stretch. I'm sweating lightly and freezing at the same time. I can't feel my ears. 'Is that ice in my mustache?'

I know better than to go from full hike mode directly into a warm building. I need a cigarette. 

I see the hotel. 'Ah, the promised land!' I stop off to the side of the door. Well deserved smoke lit. 'That's better.' 

Finish smoke. Gear is still on. Inside. Drop pack near a couch. Start peeling off layers.

""Were you a boy scout?"" It's the woman at the front desk. I laugh. ""Yeah I was. A long time ago though."" ""I knew it! My boyfriend was a boy scout. He told me about the layers."" 

I start to give her my info. She's already on it. ""I just need to run his card for incidentals... It just declined."" She starts listing the usual options. I've got my debit card, but that will definitely decline. There's a dollar and change on there.

I message dude. We wait. I tried calling my brother to see if he might put his card down. No answer.

The front desk girl tries everything. Running the card again. Calls. Sends an email. She was super helpful, and very gracious about it. I couldn't ask for a better person to deal with. 

After a while she tells me I can hang out as long as I need. The overnight person is cool too. I'm in good hands.

Get a message. ""I'm on hold with them right now."" Such a feeling of relief! I walk over to the desk. She double checks to make sure the card goes through...

All is good! I'm stoked! I thank dude. I thank her for all of her help. Grab a luggage cart. Toss pack on. Into the elevator. Upstairs. (Top floor no less. Thanks man!!!) Down the hall. Key opens the door...

Presented in a beautiful cut-glass dish, it was firm yet incredibly rich and dense. The texture was uniquely thick, kinda chewy, and creamy, almost like a dense custard, unlike the smoother puddings often found.

This bottle is part of the Cooper series from Penelope where their bourbon is finished in casks from different cooperages from around the world. Vino de Naranja is a traditional white wine from Spain steeped with orange peels lending to a citrus forward pour. (right up my alley)

**Appearance:** In the darker corner of my room, it’s dark and rusty, but in the light, it’s a vibrant, orange marmalade color. For 95 proof, the legs are longer and more viscous than expected.

**Nose:** In a similar vein, the nose on this 95 proofer is more complex and robust than expected. I of course get citrus and orange, but without any of the wine notes shining through. This is a big plus for me as wine notes are not generally my favorite. Heavy vanilla was one of the first notes I detected on the nose, but as the pour opened up, that evolved into a fresh baked pastry note. Like the high end, good kind. It’s sugary.

**Palate:** The palate for me is the biggest let down on this pour. I don’t find it overly complex or interesting. I mainly pick up a ying and a yang – some traditional sweet bourbon notes mixed with the bitterness of the orange peel that is quite prominent (as expected) in this pour.

**Finish:** My first thought on the finish was a sweet, cakey, citrus pastry. I can’t say I’ve ever had a dessert that tasted like this finish, but it actually left me craving that recipe. What’s funny is that when I looked up some of the info on the mash bill and age statement from the Penelope website, their tasting notes have “iced coffee cake with blood orange glaze” as the note for the nose. While I’m thrilled that my novice palette picked this up, I detect it more strongly on the finish.

**Score: 7.49 / 10 (Great):** Despite the weak palate, this bourbon just has something about it that makes me want to keep coming back to it. Its easy, beautiful, and complex on the nose. Just how you would like a women to be on the eye. The bottle is good looking, and the finish is very enjoyable – my favorite part of the sip. And I think that’s exactly it. The finish is so lovely and so full of flavor despite the 95 proof point. I don’t find it watered down at all. The finish makes you keep wanting to go back to it. MSRP around 89 bucks, probably a bit more than id like to pay and one of the reasons I couldn’t go above a 7.5. I was lucky enough to get mine closer to 65 bucks from a buddy of mine. I would highly recommend giving this a try.

1pmwg81,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pmwg81,"CHIUnE (Tokyo, Japan)","I didn’t take many photos because the person I was with was taking them, but I also don’t want to post his photos in case it was rude to share before asking.

Anyway, CHIUnE was one of my favorite restaurants when it opened but I could never get back in as I was still in high school / college n didn’t have control of my own schedule of when I was going back to Japan. Fast forward to a very nice person who was looking for a person to join them for a meal here off of Foodiesprime and I ended up booking a trip to Japan instead of my original Hayato reservation (ended up meeting some Hayato regulars who mentioned Rainier was in Japan too funnily enough). 

Having not been since the move, I was intensely excited as CHIUnE was maybe one of the greatest restaurants I’d been to all those years ago. I’ve got to say this lived up to my previous experience - my dining partner mentioned it may be better to come in spring but I’ve got to say I loved every moment of my meal.

I think Satoshi is a genius and I’m only more motivated to now try and visit Yamazaki next trip.

Courses were:

1. Tennen hotate capellini, intensity refined every bite was an exercise in perfect seasoning. There’s a risk doing such simple food feels cheap or shallow but every bite came through with the quality I was expecting from the past

2. White truffle consomme, stratospheric - the truffles themselves gave their aroma perfectly to the consomme and taste was sublime. Better than what had been my previous favorite consomme before my first visit, the beef consomme at kawamura

3. Shiitake, egg yolk and yamaimo purée - the bites with the shiitake and yamaimo continue to be some of my favorite things ever. The yolk is a perfect addition after I’ve also savoured the original taste of just the shiitake and yamaimo

4. Fried lily bulb with some being topped with shisho, atop rice. Excellent, I didn’t love it at first but the bites with the shisho leaves really just put this over the top 

5. Seikogani chawanmushi, intense but delicious. Kurosaki’s echizengani chawanmushi was still lingering in my mind from lunch that day but this was just underneath it. The chawans this trio were just so insane at the places that did good ones

6. The Daikon, one side cooked and finished either a bit more salt. Always an extremely fun progression - the final bites displaying a perfect level of salinity 

7. Torafugu karaage atop a bed of leeks, insane. I loved this a lot - the breading was maybe the best seasoned breading I’ve ever had and the meat was cooked perfectly. I didn’t get fugu the whole trip and then I had it at Kurosaki (excellent) and here - I even got the nikogori I love

8. The jikasei Kurobuta chorizo and shaved mushroom atop the eggplant purée. I fucking hate eggplant and I loved this dish, there’s really not much to say - just executed so well. I’d not had it before but had seen it become a staple on the menu in the time I couldn’t come again. It was great to finally try it again

9. Gifu duck with a namenko mushroom purée and duck jus, excellent - one of the best duck dishes ever. There’s very few that compare to this 

10. The Kurobuta pork, grilled in that sauce. Great, this was like the one thing I remember being a little improved in the past

11. Matsubagani gohan, a great final savoury. With this I think I ended up meeting my big winter crab goals for this trip which was super fun 

12. Shaoxing ice cream, perfect temp’d - it’s odd to call the dessert of a meal in which I loved almost everything the best course but I think I have to. I don’t think I’ve had a better ice cream before, full stop. Maybe the homemade coffee liquor ones I made myself? But that’s a preference thing - everyone loved this and I’m no exception

CHIUnE is one of my favorite restaurants ever and I’m so glad to have been able to go back and have it live up to everything I remembered. Satoshi ended up following me and it was just such a great experience overall - I’m definitely coming back. I’ve gotta see what Yamazaki is about as well, that was the big non-sushi miss for me this go around",8,1765766734.0,finedining,6,0.83,False

what i've done so far:

1pmwah2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1pmwah2/how_i_finally_cleared_sibo/,How I Finally Cleared SIBO,"Stop what you’re doing and do a stool test and upload it to AI. Over 2 years and 11 months I had tried everything. I even did an elemental diet for two weeks, a lot of xifaxin, went to the best motility doctors, and tried all the motility medications.

December 2024

I did a Biomesight test. When I got the results back a few weeks later, I felt overwhelmed and defeated and did not take any action on it.

March 2025

One night, I uploaded the full 40-page Biomesight report into ChatGPT, asked it to be a world renowned functional medicine doctor, and started really digging into it. I was in the 100th Percentile for Bilophila wadsworthia and 97th percentile for H2S (breakdown of AI comparison is below)

A few weeks later I started with the recommendations. Nothing had ever worked for I did it and did not expect anything. If I had been expecting it to work I think it probably wouldn’t have. I had dabbled in all the supplements before Antrantil etc.

May to June 2025

I began feeling noticeably better and was able to stop doing colonics. Stopped going on SIBO Reddit in early June.

June to July 2025

I was eating homemade blueberry sorbet with Greek yogurt and felt amazing - a whole bag of frozen blueberries and several scoops of Greek yogurt. I still went easy on salads because I was afraid of them, but I was consistently eating cooked vegetables and Greek yogurt.

July to October 2025

I had no SIBO symptoms during this period. However, I had to take several rounds of antibiotics for a Ureaplasma infection. Sometimes it was one to two rounds per month, occasionally back to back or even multiple rounds in a row.

November 2025

I took doxycycline again for Ureaplasma. I had taken it earlier in the summer without issues, but after so many antibiotics overall, my symptoms started to return. Because the symptoms felt so similar to SIBO, I ordered another Biomesight test, convinced it was back.

December 2025

The results came in. Despite the symptoms feeling very much like SIBO, the test showed that I had actually cleared it. Instead, I was dealing with a different underlying issue, which was surprising and a result of antibiotics killing off certain bacteria and another bacteria growing (not SIBO).

⸻

Here’s the analysis of my Biomesight test that led me to treat the SIBO.

1. Bilophila wadsworthia (The Main Culprit)

This percentile ranking compares you to everyone else tested. A higher percentile here is bad (it means you have more of the pathogen than other people).

• December 2024 (Before): 100th Percentile 

• What this means: You were literally ""off the charts."" You had higher levels of this bacteria than 100% of the comparison group. You were in the extreme outlier zone for this infection.

• November 2025 (Current): 13th Percentile 

• What this means: You are now in the bottom tier. 87% of people have more of this bacteria than you do. You successfully went from the very top to the very bottom.

2. Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) Production (The Toxin)

This ranks your potential to produce the toxic gas that causes SIBO symptoms.

• December 2024 (Before): 97th Percentile 

• What this means: You were in the top 3% of gas producers. Your gut was a massive factory for Hydrogen Sulfide compared to the general population.

• November 2025 (Current): 33rd Percentile 

• What this means: You are now well below average. You produce less gas than the majority (67%) of healthy people.

Summary of the Shift

You went from the Top 1-3% (Critical Danger Zone) to the Bottom 13-33% (Safe Zone). This is statistically a massive recovery.

I spent an unbelievable amount of money trying to fix this. Easily $30,000 plus on every protocol, supplement, practitioner, and treatment I could find.

The BiomeSight test itself costs about $150 and takes a few weeks to come back. The only hard part is that you need to be able to have a bowel movement to do it.

My biggest takeaway and honestly my only advice is this: don’t overthink it. Just do the BiomeSight test. If you want to work with a functional medicine doctor too, that’s fine, but AI is essentially a supercomputer, and you get instant answers and you can ask it endless questions.

I literally asked it to act as a world-renowned functional medicine doctor, analyze my BiomeSight results, and tell me what was actually driving my symptoms and how to fix them. That was the turning point.

What I started at the end of March and continued through June was very simple, but I was consistent:

•	Garlic, 2 to 3 times a day

•	Oregano, 2 to 3 times a day

•	Artichoke, twice a day

•	Ginger, twice a day

•.    Four Thorne DE almost every time I ate - sometimes I did two but for dinner it was always four

•	Acetylcholine support in the morning

•	Phosphatidylcholine support at night

•	HCl once in the morning

•	No salads, only small amounts of cooked vegetables

•	Stopped Starbucks coffee and switched to a healthier coffee option

Some other things I can add, but those are the big ones.

I eventually added pure butyrate and Akkermansia, but I had already been having regular bowel movements and significantly less bloating for at least two to three months before adding those. I was one of those SIBO patients who was genuinely afraid of probiotics.",7,1765766241.0,SIBO,5,0.74,False
