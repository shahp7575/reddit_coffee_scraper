I‚Äôve been eating pretty terribly the last few weeks, like lots of chocolate and junk foods.

I am well aware there are countless grinder questions daily, but I believe this might be a bit of a special take on the topic, as I'm not after the last bit of grind quality.

I am looking to replace a Bodum Bistro burr grinder (modded burr holder for a finer grind), mainly because the soft touch exterior is degrading into a sticky mess under my climate and coffee oils.

I use it for Moka Pot and Aeropress and (rarely) french press. 

I have a Kingrinder K6 for espresso with a Flair classic, so I can experiment and optimize all I want if I feel like it. I can't be bothered to grind for a 6-cup Bialetti with the K6, though.

My wife doesn't drink coffee, but likes to make it. I am grateful for that and don't want to make it more troublesome or messy than it needs to be.

So here's what I'm looking for:
- Capable for Moka Pot and coarser
- Bean hopper and timer preferred, if it's well adjustable. The Bodum basically jumps from 3 to 6 seconds somewhere around the 5s mark.
- Easy and reproducible adjustment of grind sizes for Moka and AP
- Exterior surface easy to clean / no soft touch that degrades to gunk. The more dishwasher safe components, the better.
- No static issues - the Bodum with its glass catch cup is actually pretty nice in that regard.

A little less ugly than the Baratzas would be nice ;-)

I'm in EU and willing to spend ~200‚Ç¨.

Wilfa Svart Aroma seems the best bet, though a bit prone to static. Is the black finish easy to clean?

Baratzas seem to be good as well. If they just weren't so ugly...

I like the idea of the digital timer of the Wilfa Balance, but is the grind quality the same as with the aroma?

Mignon Crono is too finicky to adjust.

I like the sleek look of the Fellows, but they're for single dosing only and the Ode Gen 1 seems to be a static nightmare.

I've read people recommend the OXO, but that's ridiculously expensive where I live.

Any more ideas?",2,1742889572.0,JamesHoffmann,1,1.0,False

APPEAL/PACKAGING: Fark‚Ä¶ 0.64 being the biggest nug with a few other ones near same size then the rest was absolute gravel. there‚Äôs a decent amount of shake too as you can see. what you can‚Äôt see is the 0.1-0.3 gravel rocks as i used all that straight away for DHV. the nugs are quite dense and dry which i‚Äôm most annoyed about idrc for popcorn nugs it‚Äôs just more than half of it wasn‚Äôt even popcorn it was either gravel sized buds or shake. Anyway onto the nugs themselves, they‚Äôre a bright green covered by white trichomes with very little feint hues of purple.

AROMA/SMELL: Was actually quite pleasing and quite strong. you get a nice creamy, latte/coffee and cake aroma. it really does give off a strong vanilla latte and or coffee bean vibe. it filled the room. 

TASTE: Creamy notes, latte undertones and a bit of an earthy pine taste on some temps. i think the translates decent but not as good as it smells.

EFFECTS: This has me feeling sedated, calm tired and no racing thoughts. although if i over consumed a little i‚Äôd have a bit of bad anxiety. might just be me. i‚Äôd say this flower suits well for night time and evening use. it helps get me to sleep which is nice.

TLDR/OVERALL: Again i‚Äôm not fussed about popcorn nugs or nothing, i‚Äôm just concerned about the quality of the flower when half of it is either shake or gravel and it‚Äôs so bloody dense and hard, quite dry also. and apart from that i think it‚Äôs decent but probably not worth the price imo. if someone else has the same batch id like to know what your experience was and if it was similar. would be worth the price if the quality was a bit better. i do enjoy the effects and benefits and also the smell of this flower.

Very few times have we been alone. I've been trying to think of things to do together that don't really feel like dates.

Technically we've already been on a couple ""dates."" One time we spent an hour just talking before going to waffle house at 5am. Romantic, I know. Last week we spent a couple of hours going to some shops and getting coffee before heading to hang out with a friend.

I've been trying to think of things tailored specifically to her. She recently got me into Pokemon Go, so I might suggest we go walk around campus or a park and catch some Pokemon. One of her favorite video game series is Borderlands, a series that's known for its split-screen gameplay. I might suggest going over to her apartment and playing it with her. 

Are there any of these ""soft dates"" that any woman would like? Ones that don't really feel like the guy is trying to get with you? We're both caffeine addicts, so I doubt she'd turn down getting some coffee again. I've considered asking her to go to a museum, but idk if she'd be interested.

These versatile devices provide a convenient ‚Äãsolution for those who are tired of searching for wall outlets in airports,coffee shops,or during outdoor adventures. ‚ÄçSelecting ‚Äåthe right power bank with an ‚Äãoutlet requires careful‚Äå consideration of capacity, output power, portability, features, and‚Å£ safety‚Äç certifications.The purpose of this article‚Äç is ‚Å¢to help consumers make informed decisions by providing in-depth reviews and highlighting top-rated power ‚Äåbanks with outlets expected to be ‚Å£available in 2025.

[[Explore Top Rated power bank with outlet on Amazon.]](https://itsallgarden.com/ebook-readers/?kw=power bank with outlet)

## Key Features Analysis

The power bank ‚Å¢with outlet combines the functionality ‚Å§of a portable charger with the ability to power devices that require an ‚ÄçAC ‚Å£outlet.‚Äã This duality‚Äå makes it ‚Å£an indispensable tool for various situations, ‚Äçfrom business travel to camping trips.

**Battery Capacity:** The battery capacity directly ‚Äåimpacts ‚Äãhow many times you can charge your devices or how long you can run ‚Äãthem.

A higher capacity, typically measured in ‚ÄçWatt-hours (Wh) or milliampere-hours (mAh), means more power is stored.‚Äå It's crucial to select a capacity that meets your needs without adding unnecessary bulk. For example, a power bank with a 100Wh capacity can ‚Äåfully charge a standard laptop ‚Å£once or multiple‚Äã smartphones. A‚Äå lower capacity may be more suitable for charging smaller devices, ‚Å£such as cameras or tablets.‚Å£ generally,capacities‚Å§ range from 50Wh to over 200Wh depending on size and intended use. Remember to consider the airline limits for carrying lithium-ion batteries, which usually cap at 100Wh without special permission.

**AC Output Power:** ‚ÄçThe AC output power determines which devices the‚Äç power bank can support and is measured in watts.

Higher wattage‚Äå allows you to power more demanding devices such as laptops,small appliances,or‚Äç even some power tools. ensure‚Äå the power bank‚Äôs AC output matches ‚Äãor exceeds‚Äã the ‚Äåpower requirements‚Å§ of your intended devices. Overloading the power bank can trigger‚Å§ its safety mechanisms and shut it down, or worse, cause damage. ‚Å£Common AC output ‚Äçranges include 85W,100W,120W,and ‚Äã150W. Some heavy-duty power banks can offer even higher output to‚Å§ handle more power-hungry gadgets.

**Portability & Weight:** A portable power bank should be easy to carry in a‚Äã backpack‚Å£ or travel bag.

Size and weight substantially affect portability. Look for models‚Å¢ that strike a balance between capacity‚Äç and compactness. Some manufacturers prioritize high capacity, resulting in heavier and bulkier units, while others ‚Äåfocus on lighter, ‚Å¢more streamlined designs with slightly lower capacity. Consider how and ‚Å§where you‚Äôll be using the power bank to determine the ideal size and weight. Dimensions and ‚Å¢weight figures are readily available in product specifications. Look for models specifically ‚Äãmarketed for travel, as they frequently enough consider portability in their design.

**Charging Ports & Compatibility:** The availability of multiple charging‚Äã ports allows users to charge several devices concurrently.

Most power banks include USB-A, USB-C, and AC output ‚Å¢ports. USB-C ports frequently enough support Power Delivery (PD) for faster charging of compatible ‚Å¢devices. Ensure the inclusion ‚Å§of‚Äç the ports you need and their respective output capabilities. The adaptability of ‚Äåcharging multiple devices at once can be a significant advantage when travelling or in group settings. specifications will detail the voltage and amperage for each port, an ‚Å§important factor to consider to ensure compatibility with your ‚Å£devices. check that the power bank supports the charging protocols that your frequently used electronics require.

**Safety Features:** Safety features protect the user and devices from potential hazards.

Overcharge protection, short circuit protection, temperature control, and surge protection are essential safety‚Å£ features. These features prevent damage to the power‚Äå bank, connected‚Äå devices, and the user. Reputable brands will ‚Äåclearly‚Äç list‚Å£ these safety features and‚Å£ adhere‚Äå to safety certifications (such as UL, CE, ‚Å§or FCC). Built-in ventilation and high-quality‚Å§ battery materials contribute to safer ‚Äãoperation, especially during extended use or in high-temperature environments.

**Display & Indicators:** A clear display or LED indicators provide essential information at a glance.

An ‚Å£LCD or LED display ‚Å§that shows battery‚Äã level, input/output wattage, and charging status is highly desirable. This information provides clarity on the power bank‚Äôs operation and remaining‚Å§ power, allowing you to plan accordingly.‚Äã Simpler models use a series of LED lights to‚Äã indicate battery levels,while more advanced units feature detailed displays ‚Äçwith more specific data.These indicators provide peace of mind and allow you to ‚Äãeffectively manage your power consumption‚Äç and charging times.

## Core Benefits

The power bank with outlet offers several core benefits that make it a valuable investment for various‚Å£ users.

**Uninterrupted Power Supply:** A power bank with an AC outlet ensures an uninterrupted power supply during travel, outdoor activities, or power outages. ‚ÄåHaving a‚Äå reliable source of ‚Äçelectricity available anywhere is especially‚Å£ useful for professionals requiring constant access to their‚Å¢ computers and‚Äç other‚Äç equipment. This uninterrupted power prevents setbacks and helps maintain productivity.

**Versatility for Various Devices:** It supports a wide range of devices, from‚Å¢ laptops and cameras ‚Å§to small appliances, eliminating‚Å§ the need for multiple chargers or searching ‚Äãfor specific adapters. Powering different types of equipment becomes easier. For ‚Äåexample, photographers can power their cameras ‚Äçand charge batteries, while travelers can keep ‚Å£their laptops and phones running on long journeys. This flexibility reduces the‚Å£ dependency on‚Äå available outlets.

**Increased Efficiency & Productivity:**‚Äã Users can charge and operate devices ‚Äåsimultaneously, maximizing efficiency and productivity. By eliminating downtime, ‚Äåyou increase efficiency and ‚Äçproductivity. Such as, while camping, you can simultaneously charge your ‚Äçphone and power a portable fan. ‚ÄåProfessionals can work‚Å§ on their laptops while keeping their other devices charged. This ‚Äãintegrated approach‚Å§ allows for optimized workflow.

**Cost Savings:** Investing in a power‚Å£ bank with an outlet can reduce costs associated with purchasing multiple chargers‚Äç or relying‚Äå on paid charging stations. Long-term savings can be significant, particularly for frequent travelers. By avoiding expensive airport charging stations and reducing the need for multiple adapters, the power bank pays for itself over time. This benefit is especially noticeable for those who frequently travel to‚Å£ areas with varying electrical standards.

**Emergency Preparedness:** A charged ‚Äçpower bank can be a crucial asset during‚Äå emergencies or unexpected power outages, allowing users ‚Äãto stay connected and power essential devices. Having a‚Å§ reliable power source during ‚Äçunforeseen events is valuable for emergency preparedness. For instance,a power bank can‚Å§ power ‚Å§a radio,charge a phone for communication,or even run a small medical device during a power outage ‚Å¢caused by a natural disaster. Staying connected and maintaining access to essential devices may prove crucial.

1jjdzsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/1jjdzsb/i_completed_too_greedily_too_deep_on_interloper/,"I completed ""Too Greedily, Too Deep"" on Interloper without ""Settled Mind"" or use of New Recipes","As the title suggest. I've been looking for things to do in my quest for 500 (maybe 1000?) days on Interloper and figured I'd attempt this achievement despite not having Settled Mind as a perk and playing on Interloper difficulty. A breakdown of the aspects of this challenge:

Quick update for those unaware, ""Too Greedily, Too Deep"" is an achievement where one must stay inside the ""Langston Mine"" in ""Zone of Contamination"" for 25 days **consecutively**. (ie can not leave the mine to reduce Cabin Fever, I've seen a lot of misunderstanding of this so figured I would clear it up here).

Based on this, I would be beset with Cabin Fever for 20^(\*) days (slightly less actually based on actual game play but we will get to that later). Cabin Fever takes a moving average of the last 6 days and when you hit an average of \~20 hours of time indoors you get ""Cabin Fever"". Put another way this is 20 x 6 = 125, however 24 x 5 = 120 as well, so if you stay indoors 5 days and 5 hours straight assuming the day before those 5 days you were outside the whole day you catch cabin fever. Cabin fever prevents you from passing time indoors (more on that later) and from sleeping indoors, thus preventing you from gaining back fatigue/condition with sleep. **Importantly**, **it also prevents any passive healing from having all of your needs met!** For those unaware, every hour you stay alive in TLD with your needs > 0, you gain back 1% condition. This is not a ton so its easy to miss, but small stuff like this can make or break an attempt. Cabin Fever, and indeed most negative afflictions (parasites, hypothermia, burns, and **SPRAINS!!**) prevent this passive healing even when your needs are met. This is easy to miss (I certainly did for a very long time despite thousands of hours). Note that I am not talking about healing from sleeping, that appears to still work even with the afflictions above, just the passive healing. (Big big shout out to **Bashrobe** for confirming this when I tested it with Cabin Fever and also pointing out that this applies to the other afflictions as well including Sprains, how many times have I been hobbling around bear island with a sprain and not a care in the world not realizing I was missing out on that sweet sweet 1% heal!)

Thus, I would essentially need to tank 19 days worth of 0 fatigue condition loss (the first day of Cabin fever I would ideally start with 100% fatigue giving me \~one free day of no condition loss with cabin fever). Each hour you have 0% fatigue you take 1% of condition dmg. Therefore I would need to tank 24 x 19 x 1% = 456% condition loss. Since you die when you hit 0%, I'll need to mitigate at least 352% (assuming I start at 105% with well fed). I probably want a bit more than that considering I like this run and want to continue after the achievement is gotten, and considering how hard it is to control Astrid while she is at low health. So lets make the goal to mitigate at least 365% condition loss, if not more.

I will need to stay fed and watered and warm while inside the mine to avoid taking any additional condition loss than is already accounted for above:

For Warm: The mine is very warm and I will be taking a Bearskin Coat in for other reasons which can double as a way to stay warm even if it wasn't. So no worries here.

For Food, I initially overestimated how many calories I would need, but it turns out standing in one places and once per day grabbing items on the ground comes out to \~3000 calories per day. That's a nice an easy 3000\*25= 75,000. For reference, the largest bear I've ever killed had about \~44,000 cals on it, but usually its closer to around 30,000. Since I can't be bothered to drag the food from another region all the way to ZoC I decided to add to the challenge by raising all of the food from ZoC itself. Since I initially thought I would need 50% more than that, I decided that the one bear spawn I'd found on ZoC would be insufficient (I'd also need food before and after the run and waiting for the bear to respawn for ages would kinda defeat the purpose as I'd need food during that stage as well). Thus enters [Bashrobe](https://youtu.be/l8BIygi4K_k?si=1tPwLPmvUoSoxI3D)**'s** video on ice fishing. I have been loving the new fishing tip ups and have already made big stockpiles of fish in both ML and CH at my main bases. Per the video linked above you can make a snow shelter at ""Unquenched Extraction"" in ZoC and make 4 ice fishing holes and maintain the holes with fishing tip ups and a hammer from inside the snow shelter. With this you can effectively stay warm and even sleep and essentially fish until your fishing tip ups run out of condition. Note I used a slightly different location from what Bashrobe used in his video in ZoC closer to where the hook is shown on [this ](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/intothelongdark/images/0/03/Zone_of_Contamination_map.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20250212050744)map at Uneuenched Extraction but feel free to experiment (placing the snow shelter is a giant pain in the ass so be forewarned, but once its down its down). In most regions you can actually run 6 fishing tip ups at a time but in ZoC you can only do 4 before getting a debuff to your fishing rate. Conveniently 4 is about the max number of holes you can interact with while inside a snow shelter if you get the placement right so it kinda works out. Sadly if the snow shelter ever gets ruined you cannot just repair it and removing it has made it impossible for me to place it back in the same spot with how I placed my fishing holes, so be careful how you set yours up if you want to use it more than just one session. In any case I used this method and fished for like 4-5 days straight, sleeping occasionally for an hour to keep stamina above 0, and starting a fire outside nearby whenever it was sunny and non windy to cook up the massive pile of fish I had caught and to make more water. I also brought tools and some fir so that I could fix the hammer in the field and also repaired the shelter whenever it got to \~76% condition so that it would only cost sticks to repair, which I also had in abundance. The only limiting factor were the tip ups themselves so theoretically if you bring a lot you could fish here for even longer. I brought 6 tip ups for 4 holes and continued fishing until they all fell below 20% condition (at which point its best to harvest them instead of letting them get ruined to save the materials). Doing this caught me about 75,000 cals worth of fish, on top of the cat tails i collected in the region and the bear I killed I had more than enough calories to survive the 25 days in the mine, as well as support my hunger before and after the attempt. (Again big shout out to Bashrobe for his amazing vid on fishing linked above, this is no joke what inspired me to attempt this challenge).

For water, there is a burn barrel just past the mine office on the third floor of the mine. This will be our home base for operations during the run. I think you could potentially do this attempt all just inside the mine and nearer a suitable base of operations but I kinda wanted to RP so I went deep into the mine. For reference my home base in ZoC is the cave near Miner's path with a bed which has a nice direct, albeit somewhat long winded path to this location inside the mine. This location inside the mine also has a bed which is nice to have as it means i wont have to use the condition of my bedroll for the first 5 days. It also has a workbench which could be useful if you had something you wanted to craft like clothing. But the main attraction is the burn barrel: Here is where all of our water will be made. For the 20 days we will be awake straight we will need to use the awake burn rate of water. When you sleep on interloper your thirst bar depletes from 100-0 in about 10 hours, however when awake it does so in just over 6 hours. to refill your bar requires 2/3L of water. Thus we will need 20 x 24/6 x 2/3L = 53.33L of water, lets call it 65L considering we will also need water for the first 5 days and some safety stock. That water need will actually go down considering the number of drinks we will be drinking over the course of the run but that's for later. For now, getting this water is relatively straight forward. You can cook 4L/1.333Hr of fuel using two pots on a burn barrel, which is basically 3L/Hr. This means we need the low sum of 22 hours of fuel. Considering the mine also has its own respawning source of coal this should not be hard to achieve, but is still something to keep in mind and gather before attempting.

So lastly, what is to be done about the condition loss from fatigue: Well there are 3 items which we make use of in this run: Coffee, Acorn Coffee, and Birch Tea. Coffee and Acorn Coffee both do the same thing. They give you some fatigue back and also reduce your fatigue decay for some time (1 hour for coffee, 0.5 hours for acorn). Thus for every hour they keep your fatigue above 0% they effectively mitigate 1% condition loss. Based on my math and testing, I've found that each coffee is essentially worth 3.33% condition (or 3.33hrs of keeping condition>0), and each acorn coffee is worth 1.75%. These efficiencies probably increase the more of them you drink consecutively (waiting for the fatigue reduction effect to wear off each time) but based on testing this seemed to be their effectiveness. Note both would be more effective if you also got the 1% healing from having all your needs > 0, but alas, there is no free healing to be had when suffering from Cabin Fever. Lastly there are birch teas which are very straight forwards and heal 5%. Given these condition loss efficiencies, we need some combo of the above to mitigate enough damage to survive the above.

Since this was not my goal from the beginning of my overall run, I had foolishly already drank many a coffee, and consumed many an acorn. Thus for this challenge I was only able to scrape together 31 coffee's and 25 acorn coffees for 102.3% and 43.75% respectively. Thus I would need to find materials for at least 45 birch teas to tank the rest of the \~220% condition loss needed. Birch is fortunately a renewable resource in TLD. However since I overestimated the effectiveness of coffee due to the assumed 1% healing. I found myself in ZoC a few Birch teas short. Luckily ZoC has 2 areas where Birch spawns naturally. One on the route from miner's footpath heading to Unquenchable Extraction. And another near Craggy Passage on the way to enduring waterfall, and both near my base at the cave near Miner's footpath. Based on testing, it appears Birch respawns on Interloper around the 10-11 day mark. It also appears as if you need to fully leave the region for it to spawn in. I tried simply going indoors and back out but no luck. However leaving through Transition cave (which is in FA for some reason) causes the birch to respawn consistently. This may be confirmation bias speaking but in any case I was able to make 53 birch teas for a total of 265% healing (well over the 220% needed!).

So we have the calories, we have the drinks to tank Cabin Fever, we have the rest. Now what, are you really just going to sit there in the caves for 20 in game days with no way to speed up time? You're crazy! (for reference without speed up, this would take about 40 real time hours of which you would still need to be eating drinking, picking things up occasionally). However, there is one last trick up my sleeve: despite almost all other forms of passing time being disabled indoors while suffering from cabin fever, you can still Harvest your clothing and cancel it right before it finishes without losing your clothing. This allows you to pass \~1.9 hours per harvest assuming you cancel right before the end with some tolerance for safety. This is really the final piece of the puzzle which made this attempt possible. Using this trick and the resources above I was able to survive to the end comfortably with about 50% condition remaining, and it only took about an hour in real time once everything was assembled. (again shout out to Bashrobe for his video on [Afflictions ](https://youtu.be/q06H0orQbfc?si=CakvDNwWxi7V1TgV)where I learned this). 

If you attempt this some notes not mentioned above:

* let your condition decay the first day your fatigue reaches 0 from cabin fever. Birch teas actually heal faster/hour than the decay from fatigue, thus you can actually easily over heal and thus lose the full benefit of the birch tea. I kept my health around 90% allowing it to fluctuate up and down by no more than 10% either way per day.
* Despite my notes on Cabin Fever above, it appears I got cabin fever 3-4 hours later than I would have assumed. I entered the mine around 9am on the clock, but did not get full cabin fever until after noon on the 5th full day in the mine. Not sure why that happened but it did save me about 4-5% condition compared to what I expected. (Edit, apparently the number to get Cabin Fever is 125 not 120, which explains the discrepancy described here, edited the value above). 
* I decided not to test it but you could, in theory, sleep through the first few hours of cabin fever. Since you get a ""cabin fever risk"" indicator I think you could wait until it was \~99% and then sleep for 10 hours (assuming your fatigue allowed it), allowing you to essentially delay your initial fatigue decay by 10 more hours if pulled off correctly. I think based on my limited testing that cabin fever does not wake you up once you are already asleep when it turns from cabin fever risk to full bore cabin fever, but don't quote me on that as I only tried it with much smaller increments to play it safe.
* You can and probably should use the recipes to delay or even prevent all together getting cabin fever. Its probably much easier than the methods I used above. I just decided doing it the way i did would be more fun, plus I saw that some of the recipes which advertise that they reduce cabin fever risk may not be working so I decided not to mess with it. But if you are looking to improve on the method here, pushing cabin fever back by an additional day or two could be very impactful and reduce the number of teas/coffees needed.
* Lastly I don't necessarily recommend this unless you like making your own life harder like I do. I had fun doing it as it gave me something to do on my interloper run, but if you are looking for an easier way, jumping on a lower difficulty or even just doing it with settled mind is much much easier.
* I think theoretically this is also possible on Misery Mode, but it would have to be the main goal of the run. Maybe something to attempt later?

I really loved this challenges and am glad they added achievements like this one to the game. I know some people don't love it but I had a ton of fun setting this up (especially the fishing part) and honestly I have no regrets.

None of this would be possible without the incredibly useful and amazing content Bashrobe gives this community for free on a regular basis on his youtube channel. If you made it this far then you probably love this game like I do, so if you haven't seen his content, [go check it out](https://www.youtube.com/@Bashrobe)! I'm sure you will love it and learn a lot as I did.

TL;DR: Forced Astrid to stay awake in a dark toxic gas filled mine for 480 hours straight eating nothing but ruined rotten fish and drinking liters of teas and coffees every day while she endlessly attempted to tear up her bearskin coat. 10/10 would do again.

Not 100.
But honestly ‚Äì what are 100 days compared to 95?
Every single sober day counts. Every one changes something.
So I‚Äôm posting this now. Because I don‚Äôt need to wait for a round number to say:
This has already changed my life.

I had my last drink on December 20th.
Not really planned ‚Äì I was out partying and someone probably put something in my drink. It was a terrible night. But somehow, that was the moment I finally said: That‚Äôs it. No more.

I had thought about quitting before. Many times. But I was scared. I drank a lot. Regularly. Often alone. Mostly in the evening.
And honestly, that‚Äôs the part I want to talk about first:
The evenings.
They were hell.
I don‚Äôt mean just feeling a bit low. I mean this constant, unbearable inner tension. Total panic, but quiet. Like my whole body was screaming. I couldn‚Äôt lie down, I couldn‚Äôt sit still.
I was totally fine during the day ‚Äì high-functioning, nobody would‚Äôve noticed anything. But as soon as it got quiet, I felt like I was falling apart. And alcohol was the only thing that made it stop.
That‚Äôs why I drank. And that‚Äôs why I couldn‚Äôt imagine stopping.

Sometimes I even drank in the morning, especially when there was still wine at home. Didn‚Äôt matter if I had to work ‚Äì I‚Äôd just crawl out of bed and survive the day.

I‚Äôve been in therapy for years, and my mental health is overall okay now. But I always thought my sleep problems were just part of that. I had them for years ‚Äì crazy bad sleep, night after night. Sleep paralysis, hallucinations, constant waking up, fear of going to bed. I used all the calming stuff you can imagine: herbal pills, melatonin, podcasts, lights on ‚Äì nothing really worked.

Now?
I just sleep. Deep and peaceful. No pills, no tricks, no fear.
That alone is a game-changer.

Here‚Äôs what else changed in these 95 days (real stuff, not just vague ‚ÄúI feel better‚Äù):

	‚Ä¢	I sleep through the night. Not just once in a while ‚Äì like, actually sleep through. I go to bed, I fall asleep, and I wake up in the morning. That sounds simple, but for me it was impossible for years. Now it just‚Ä¶ works. And I can‚Äôt get over how big that is.

	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve lost some weight. Not a huge transformation or anything, but I feel way less bloated, my face looks sharper, and I look more awake. I actually recognize myself in the mirror again.

	‚Ä¢	I have more energy. Not like ‚Äúcrazy hyper‚Äù energy, just steady, real energy. I don‚Äôt need five coffees to start my day. I wake up, and I can do things. Clean the apartment, go for a walk, run errands ‚Äì normal stuff, but without feeling like it drains my whole soul.

	‚Ä¢	I actually enjoy moving now. I go jogging sometimes, or just go out for long walks ‚Äì and it helps. I never thought I‚Äôd say that, but it‚Äôs become part of what keeps me grounded.

	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm less irritable. I don‚Äôt snap over small things anymore, and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm constantly about to explode. Things still stress me out sometimes, but it‚Äôs manageable now.

	‚Ä¢	I can focus again. I‚Äôm not just jumping between tasks or doomscrolling. I can sit down, read a book, plan something, or just stay mit one thing for a while. That hasn‚Äôt happened in years.

	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm planning a solo trip ‚Äì just for me. And instead of being scared or overwhelmed by it, I‚Äôm actually excited. I never thought I‚Äôd feel like that again.

	‚Ä¢	I picked up pottery. It started randomly, but now it‚Äôs something I really enjoy. Just using my hands and being in the moment. It helps me feel connected to myself in a weird way.

	‚Ä¢	I go out with friends, to bars and restaurants, and I don‚Äôt drink. And that‚Äôs totally fine. I still have fun, I still laugh, I still feel like me. Actually, more like me than I did before.

	‚Ä¢	I started driving again. I didn‚Äôt trust myself with that for a long time ‚Äì not physically, but mentally. Now I feel safe doing it.

	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve started doing thoughtful things again. Like putting real time and love into gifts or planning things for people I care about. It‚Äôs like I have space in my brain and heart again.

	‚Ä¢	I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm slowly destroying my body anymore. That constant background fear is gone. And that‚Äôs such a relief.

	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm okay with quiet weekends. Staying home, doing nothing, just being. Sundays don‚Äôt scare me anymore. That used to be the worst day of the week. Now it‚Äôs sometimes even nice.

To be honest, I had built a whole identity around alcohol.
Good wine, nice bars, matching drinks with every situation. Especially around food, around dating, around fun. That‚Äôs still something I notice now and then ‚Äì like something is missing.

And no, I‚Äôm not 100% sure if I‚Äôll never drink again. Maybe someday I‚Äôll have a small glass of wine with dinner. Maybe I won‚Äôt.
But when I think about it, I honestly ask myself: Why?
For what? For who?
And honestly‚Ä¶ I kinda like cherry juice better now anyway.

I‚Äôve also had a few dreams where I drink by accident. And in the dream I‚Äôm like: ‚ÄúOh nooo, what did I do??‚Äù But then I wake up and it‚Äôs kind of funny. Not scary. Just strange.
It‚Äôs like my brain is still processing that this is real now.


The biggest thing is:
I like myself more now.
I can sit with myself and not panic. I can chill on the couch, watch something light, go to bed early, wake up early ‚Äì and feel good.
It‚Äôs not boring. It‚Äôs peaceful.

If you‚Äôre reading this and you‚Äôre still in that cycle ‚Äì still drinking, still thinking it can‚Äôt get better ‚Äì
I get it. I really do. I didn‚Äôt think it would change either.
But it did. And it keeps changing.

You don‚Äôt just get your old self back.
You get something new.
Softer. Quieter.
But real.
And really, really good.",10,1742887077.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False

You see new colors and meaning. Like that line in Pink Floyd‚Äôs *Time*:

**‚ÄúAnd then one day you find ten years have got behind you / No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.‚Äù**

I understood it completely when I turned 35.

I promise you, the number of my personal stories related to Radiohead is finite. I just feel this story might lift someone‚Äôs spirits‚Äîor maybe help them see their own reflection in it.

I went through a really rough and irrationally violent divorce four years ago. The scale of hatred was intense, and I‚Äôll never truly understand her motivations. I was isolated from my child, pushed out of my home, lost all my money‚Äînothing new for many people, unfortunately.

This isn‚Äôt a confession or a cry for sympathy‚Äîit‚Äôs just a story.

I truly believe some of you have gone through emotionally devastating breakups, and you know how, at times, even we ourselves want to hurt the other person even more. After years of therapy, I understood that this is mostly a projection of our own pain‚Äîa way to show how much we‚Äôre suffering. But back then, I was more like a blind man, just sinking punch after punch.

Close friends started getting involved in the story and, as usual, began taking sides‚Äîwho supports whom. I love my friends; most of them understood me, stood by me, and were there in the moment when I was breaking down.

But one of them decided to **burn every bridge between us** and chose her side. That was his decision, and that‚Äôs fine.

But unlike the pain from her actions‚Äîwhich was intense in the moment, but healed relatively quickly‚Äîhis betrayal still makes me feel sick from time to time.

I think you‚Äôve already guessed. I was listening to Radiohead, and of course my favorite album at the time was *Amnesiac*. Calm, gentle, tender songs and lyrics‚Äîexactly what my soul needed.

And what did I see? That this album is **exactly** about surviving a devastating breakup.

Nothing healed me more than *You and Whose Army?*. It was a true revelation‚Äîeach line, each phrase of that song.

**‚ÄúYou forget so easy‚Äù**‚Äîlike we never had anything good, like we were never in love or happy together.

I felt like I was burning alive, and my new anthem was telling me:

**‚ÄúYou and whose army?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúYou and your cronies.‚Äù**

Those lines made me feel so much stronger.

**‚ÄúCome on if you think you can take us on.‚Äù**

I had to move in with a friend before I could afford my own apartment. At first, he probably thought I‚Äôd lost my mind. But later, during our morning coffees, we would sing out loud together:

**‚ÄúWe ride tonight!‚Äù**

Me in tears, and he‚Äîhe later told me‚Äîwas happy for me. Happy I didn‚Äôt give up on life, didn‚Äôt give up on my child, and allowed myself to feel and let the emotions pass through.

I‚Äôve never shared this story on any social network. I couldn‚Äôt find the right way to explain it.

Recently, I realized that framing it as an observation of a Radiohead song finally made it work for me.

I feel relief sharing it with you.

Yesterday, I picked up my daughter from her guitar lesson. She was wearing a hat with a *The Bends* pin. She‚Äôs obsessed with Jonny.

We were heading home (I have partial custody for now). She always holds my hand‚Äîalready a kind of grown-up girl.

And standing at the crosswalk, squinting into the warm spring sun,

I suddenly realized:

1jjdo3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1jjdo3b/i_accidentally_discovered_a_way_of_lucid_dreaming/,I accidentally discovered a way of lucid dreaming using coffee with 90% sucess rate. Its kinda complex though.,"Youve seen the title. Lemme give you a short run down-

i sometimes wake up at 4 AM and drink a cup of coffee. Then i go for another nap for 2 hours from 9 AM. And for some reason, 9/10 times when i try to use WILD during this, i end up getting a lucid dream. ive probably gotten over 20-25 lucid dreams like this the past few months.

Another thing to add here is that when i have sleep debt, like i did today where i slept 5 hours before 4 am, it works 90% of the time. If i get full fledged sleep like 7-8 hours, it drops down to around 40-50%. But i havent done this a lot in this scenario so i dont have enough data lol.

So here's what happens

since i try to nap 4 hours after coffee, im near the caffeine crash stage but not there yet. When i lay down,my head feels heavy but not sleepy enough that i simply lose all focus and fall asleep instantly. Since the caffeiene in my blood makes me stay alert, i tend to also stay lightly focused without losing conscousness. And when it suddenly feels like my head fell from a high place on to the pillow and my whole body kinda feels like water (its hard to explain), im sure im falling asleep so i start imagining my self in some sort of scenario doing something.

like today i imagined my self jumping on my bed trying to backflip on the floor, and after a while it actually happened, i backflipped onto the floor and i was sure i was lucid dreaming.

One thing i want to ask since im still kinda of a begginer, I DONT HAVE ANY CONTROL DAWG. The only thing i can seem to do is jump really high. I cant spawn things, travel to places and cant even fly. Ive only managed to spawn a bull once in an attempt to fight it, but it ended up beating me up and chasing me instead. LIKE WHY IS MY CONTROL SO DOG WATER AURURGH.

edit: i should add that sleep debt is necessary in my method",6,1742886832.0,LucidDreaming,2,0.88,False

1jjdm17,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jjdm17/my_complicated_relationship_with_my_parents/,My complicated relationship with my parents,"My (24F) parents separated when I was 7 and my sibling was 3. My dad has another daughter (15), my mother had two additional children (14M, 10F). As the oldest I never felt like I fit in anywhere and often times my siblings were prioritised more.

I went NC with my dad five years ago, after my grandpas funeral. His wife made everything about herself, I was on heavy medication and loosing my grandpa, who was the only one who treated everyone fairly, made me devastated. My relationship with my mother was getting way better as we never even got into a small argument ever again. We regularly met up and called each other on a daily basis.

My sibling were always prioritised more than me. I understood this, as they were babies and toddlers once, but it hurt. However my sibling was always almost everyone‚Äôs favourite child, whatever they wanted they got it. They were always the centre of attention and spoiled. While I struggled to fit in, they had no issues at all. My sibling is pregnant with their first child and everyone is excited.

Due to work, I barely have time to meet up with mom and my siblings. Lately my mom barely has time to even call me, because again everyone else is much more important apparently. My siblings, my stepdad, her friends and even the neighbours are more of a priority, so our calls ended quickly. I couldn‚Äôt even get five minutes to talk with her in peace. 

I met my dad right before Christmas at my grandma‚Äòs place. It was very awkward but still good? Again the focus was more on my sibling, as they announced their pregnancy, but we also had a good talk during smoking breaks outside.


My mom was telling me nonstop that we barely do anything together. When I was in business school back in February, we met up once and ate something. That was nice. She promised me, that we will meet up during my vacation in March, just the two of us and have a great time. I was very excited. But whenever I called to agree on a time, anything else was again more important and she didn‚Äôt want any ‚Äûjealousy‚Äú so my siblings don‚Äôt need to know. Well, guess how confused I was when, my sibling texted me when and where we‚Äôre going to meet up. First I was pissed, I called my mom and she dismissed my feelings, as it‚Äôs not a big deal and we could meet up earlier. But this didn‚Äôt make it any better. Any news regarding our family I get by my sibling.

I broke down sobbing the next day. This has been going on for 20 years of my life. Whenever someone needs me I‚Äôm good enough and it needs to be done immediately, but my feeling‚Äôs and needs get dismissed constantly. It sounds childish I know, but I just want a day alone with my mom. The youngest two are living with her, my sibling visits her every weekend. I only want a day to spend time with her alone. That‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôm asking for.

So I called my paternal grandma to vent. She calmed me down and invited me to stay at her place for a few days. So I went. It was very relaxing, because she lives in a beautiful and calm village. To my surprise my dad came too. We met up for coffee, he asked me what was going on and gave me helpful advice. For the first time in forever it felt like my dad was finally being a dad. He even acknowledged that he sees how much I tried growing up to be validated by him. He told me, I need to prioritise myself now. I don‚Äôt have to cut my mom out, but I need a healthy distance, similar how the five years of NC between us helped us to gather ourselves. My dad had the same issue, his younger brother was the favourite child too. He told me, that this might never change. And the best way to deal with it is to accept that. It will be painful in the beginning, but in the long run, it will be the best. It is good advice. I finally felt understood and got a parent to have one on one time with. 

And just to be clear, I love my siblings. I know it isn‚Äôt their fault for being prioritised and favoured. I have a really good relationship with my siblings(except for my dad‚Äòs daughter, as I don‚Äôt know her well). Even though they‚Äôre the favourite, we‚Äôre still close. They trust me and we have a great bond. I was even the first person they told they were expecting, even before our parents. I need to find a way to distance myself without hurting my bonds with my siblings.

Cinnamon is a popular spice known for its warm, sweet taste. When added to coffee, it can enhance the flavor and offer various health benefits, like reducing inflammation and regulating blood sugar. But striking the right balance is key. Too much cinnamon can overpower your coffee, making it bitter.

On the other hand, too little may not give you the flavor you‚Äôre looking for. In this blog post, we‚Äôll explore the best amount of cinnamon to use in your coffee. We‚Äôll also discuss how to incorporate it into your morning routine for the best results. Ready to make your coffee more exciting? Let‚Äôs dive in!

# Cinnamon And Coffee

Cinnamon and coffee are a delightful combination. Adding cinnamon to coffee not only enhances the flavor but also offers various health benefits. This blog post explores how much cinnamon to add to your coffee to get the best taste and health perks. Let‚Äôs dive into the unique flavor profile and health benefits of cinnamon in coffee.

# Flavor Profile

Cinnamon adds a warm, sweet, and slightly spicy taste to coffee. This spice complements the natural flavors of coffee, making your drink more enjoyable. Here are some reasons why cinnamon enhances the coffee flavor:

* **Balanced Sweetness**: Cinnamon adds a natural sweetness without the need for extra sugar.
* **Rich Aroma**: The scent of cinnamon can make your coffee smell more inviting.
* **Spicy Kick**: It adds a subtle spiciness that enriches the coffee‚Äôs flavor profile.

To achieve the best flavor, it‚Äôs crucial to use the right amount of cinnamon. Typically,¬†**1/4 teaspoon per cup**¬†is a good starting point. You can adjust based on your taste preference.

|Amount of Coffee|Amount of Cinnamon|
|:-|:-|
|1 cup|1/4 teaspoon|
|2 cups|1/2 teaspoon|
|4 cups|1 teaspoon|

Experimenting with different amounts can help you find the perfect balance for your taste buds. Some people also enjoy adding other spices like nutmeg or cloves for a more complex flavor.

# Health Benefits

Adding cinnamon to coffee is not just about taste. It also comes with a host of health benefits. Here are some key benefits:

* **Antioxidant Properties**: Cinnamon is rich in antioxidants, which help fight free radicals in the body.
* **Anti-Inflammatory**: It can reduce inflammation, which is beneficial for conditions like arthritis.
* **Blood Sugar Control**: Cinnamon helps in regulating blood sugar levels, making it a good addition for those with diabetes.

Research shows that cinnamon can improve heart health by lowering cholesterol levels. It may also have antimicrobial properties, helping to fight bacterial and fungal infections.

Including cinnamon in your coffee can boost your immune system, thanks to its antiviral properties. It‚Äôs also known to improve digestion and relieve indigestion.

While these benefits are impressive, it‚Äôs important to use cinnamon in moderation. Excessive consumption can lead to adverse effects. Sticking to the recommended 1/4 teaspoon per cup ensures you enjoy the benefits without any risks.

# Choosing The Right Cinnamon

Adding cinnamon to coffee can elevate your morning brew to new heights. But how much cinnamon should you add? And which type of cinnamon is best? Choosing the right cinnamon can make a significant difference in flavor and health benefits. Let‚Äôs delve into the details to help you make an informed choice.

# Ceylon Vs. Cassia

When it comes to cinnamon, there are two main types: Ceylon and Cassia. Understanding the differences between them is essential for choosing the right one for your coffee.

* Also known as ‚ÄúTrue Cinnamon.‚Äù
* Has a lighter, sweeter flavor.
* Contains lower levels of coumarin, a natural compound that can be harmful in large doses.

* More common and less expensive.
* Has a stronger, spicier flavor.
* Contains higher levels of coumarin.

Many people prefer Ceylon cinnamon for its delicate taste and lower coumarin content. However, Cassia cinnamon is more readily available and budget-friendly. Here‚Äôs a quick comparison:

|Type|Flavor|Coumarin Content|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Ceylon|Sweeter, delicate|Low|Higher|
|Cassia|Strong, spicy|High|Lower|

Choosing between Ceylon and Cassia depends on your taste preference and health considerations. If you drink coffee daily and want to add cinnamon regularly, Ceylon may be the better choice due to its lower coumarin content.

# Quality Matters

Quality is crucial when adding cinnamon to coffee. Poor quality cinnamon can have a bland taste and may contain impurities. Here are some tips to ensure you‚Äôre getting the best quality:

* **Check the Source:**¬†Look for cinnamon sourced from reputable regions like Sri Lanka for Ceylon and Indonesia for Cassia.
* **Organic Options:**¬†Choose organic cinnamon to avoid pesticides and other chemicals.
* **Freshness:**¬†Fresher cinnamon has a stronger aroma and better flavor. Check the packaging date.

Buying whole cinnamon sticks and grinding them yourself can also ensure better quality. Pre-ground cinnamon loses its flavor and potency over time. Here‚Äôs a quick guide to help you:

1. Buy whole cinnamon sticks.
2. Use a spice grinder or a mortar and pestle.
3. Grind only what you need for immediate use.

Quality cinnamon not only enhances the flavor of your coffee but also provides more health benefits. Fresh, high-quality cinnamon is rich in antioxidants and can help regulate blood sugar levels.

In summary, choosing the right type and quality of cinnamon can make your coffee experience delightful and healthy. Whether you prefer the sweet notes of Ceylon or the robust flavor of Cassia, always opt for the best quality to enjoy the full benefits of this wonderful spice.

# Ideal Cinnamon Amounts

Adding cinnamon to coffee not only enhances its flavor but also offers numerous health benefits. Knowing the ideal amount of cinnamon to use is crucial for achieving the perfect balance. Too much can overpower the coffee, while too little might not bring out the desired taste. Let‚Äôs delve into the ideal cinnamon amounts for different types of coffee.

# For Regular Brews

Regular brews are the most common type of coffee. They include drip coffee, pour-over, and French press. The amount of cinnamon you add depends on personal taste, but here are some guidelines:

* Start with¬†**1/4 teaspoon**¬†of ground cinnamon per cup of coffee.
* If you prefer a stronger flavor, increase the amount to¬†**1/2 teaspoon**.
* For a subtle hint, use¬†**1/8 teaspoon**.

Here‚Äôs a table summarizing the ideal cinnamon amounts for regular brews:

|Cinnamon Amount|Flavor Intensity|
|:-|:-|
|1/8 teaspoon|Subtle|
|1/4 teaspoon|Moderate|
|1/2 teaspoon|Strong|

To add cinnamon to your regular brew, mix the ground cinnamon with coffee grounds before brewing. This ensures an even distribution of flavor. If you prefer a milder taste, sprinkle cinnamon on top of your brewed coffee. Remember, experimenting with different amounts can help you find the perfect balance for your taste.

1jjdhma,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jjdhma,So I Just Finished Splintered,"
Hello everyone. 

TLDR: Splintered is a **16 bit retro-inspired JRPG** with a **heavy influence** from the original **Dragon Quest**, driving those inspirations into a modern twist with a **focus on randomization**. For the price of a drink at a coffee shop this game is meant to be a treasure for a very specific audience. It is **recommended** more so than usual to **try the demo** for this game before a purchase to see if it is the right title for you.

So I finished all available content (as of this post both Chapter 1 and Chapter 2) of Splintered, an early access 16 bit retro-inspired JRPG that was **released on March 21st** (just a few days ago). I had found the title through browsing the upcoming turn-based RPGs on Steam about a month ago and had **downloaded the demo** to play later on my backlog. I had forgotten about it until I saw a post on this subreddit from a u/RichardMurtland promoting his game (props to him, he's been promoting his game pretty heavily on various subreddits from what I understand). After quickly looking through his post the name of the game sounded familiar and lo and behold, the demo was already a part of my Steam library ready to go. After finishing it I looked at the price tag and decided to make **a whim purchase**; the game was as **cheap as the coffee I usually order**. I was making one last purchase on Steam for the season and I figured what was a few more dollars on top of that. 

Splintered is both developed and published by **dotMake Studios**, a **solo dev** company belonging to **Richard Murtland**. This is the studio's (and his) **first game**, being in **development for around a year** from the looks of the various shorts on the Richard Murtland Youtube channel (those shorts were really informative by the way, I really enjoyed looking through most of them). This game is a just-released **early access title** with a projected **3-6 month period** for it to be fully released. There was a Steam announcement just today actually as of the time of writing this about a patch fix and it seems the developer is active both on the Steam community forums and the game's own Discord page. Good signs of communication from the studio, but I would understand if some consumers would be apprehensive about the early access release.

The game sells for a **price of $5**, but is currently **on sale for $4.50 until March 28th** to promote its early access release. It is honestly a little refreshing to see a game be sold for that little cost, being priced accordingly for what the game aspires to be and what it offers as a gameplay experience. Its first few days being available are going well it seems, with a **promising 100% positive reviews (from a total pool of 43 reviewers)**.

I've done a few different gaming sessions with my **total logtime** on Steam ending at **4.9 hours**. This playtime is a little skewed though (as I'll speak about later), **more than likely** an expected playtime of Splintered until the end of chapter 2 will fall around the **6 hour to 7 hour range**. The game also features post game content (to be discussed later) that will further increase replayability and playtime; your mileage will vary. I played Splintered on Steam Deck (I would recommend it on Steam Deck as well).

Positives: 

**The game nails its inspiration very well**. Splintered takes cues from **Dragon Quest 1** for its approach of **combat, exploration, and theming**. As someone who's never played Dragon Quest 1 or any of the old school JRPGs I've always had an interest to go back and look at what made the genre what it is today. I've briefly looked at DQ1 videos for this review and the resemblance is very clear, from UI design, sprites, overworld and so on. Even how ingame overworld progression is designed feels like it hearkens back to an older generation, where you receive vague hints from NPCs and you're left to explore for yourself what you need to do to advance the story. The **nostalgia factor** of a title like this doesn't impact someone like myself however if you have enjoyed the former game when you were younger I could easily see Splintered falling into your wheelhouse. 

**UI and performance are incredibly smooth**. Navigating everything from the title screen to the in game menus is instantaneous, even the transition from overworld to enemy encounters is a blistering speed in and out. **Shop UI, battle UI and general UI are simple and well thought out**, leaving little room for misinterpretation. Even little things like battle sound effects and the way that experience orbs and money jump to your experience and total money respectively is satisfying. It leads to the overall game feeling incredibly polished whilst still remaining faithful for what the game is trying to achieve. 

**Focus on equipment abilities** and variety is a big plus. Similar to say Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, Splintered's equippable items all have **different ability passives** that can gain experience independent of your own character's experience bar. Items start with an ability unlocked (with a few exceptions) and for every **level up** that you achieve with said item a new **ability gets unlocked**. For example, let's say that you buy a dagger from the next town over. That dagger will have a level 1 ability already unlocked and ready to go once you equip it, and the more experience your character gains the more experience that dagger gains as well, leveling up alongside your character statistics. 

- The passives themselves are **meaningful and relevant**, leading to an almost **class-like approach** (very much intentional). For example, that dagger instead of boosting a flat rate to damage with every level can prevent enemy ambushes, and give you a high chance to critical hit an enemy on the first turn leaning towards a one-shot critical thief archetype. All pieces of weapons, armor, shields and accessories fall under **different theoretical archetypes**, with the player being able to mix-and-match as they see fit. This approach is nice, enabling player freedom instead of for example locking in a certain class on character creation. 

Splintered's take on **enemy rewards are interesting**. Instead of having traditional item drops, the game has a **'Talent' page** in the overworld menu almost akin to a bestiary. The talent page is then divided up into hidden groups that showcase different enemy sprites, with those sprites showing a 'Slain!' text once first defeated in battle. Once all sprites in a category are slain, the player is then **rewarded with an equippable passive** that improves different elements in the game. These categories are grouped by enemy family and by difficulty encounter, leading to a **strong sense of progression** and rewards as you continue on with the game.

- For example, the first group in the talent page will show all of the early-game encounters that the player is meant to fight first. Exploring the overworld next to the starting kingdom and slaying all of the enemy groups will reward the player with a passive that increases earned EXP, designed perfectly for the early game. **Talent rewards become increasingly better** as the player fills out the page and defeats stronger enemies, with the **best talent passives locked** behind the **strongest encounters** in the overworld. It's a smart and welcome system, giving modern flair to such a traditional combat system. 

Neutral:

Splintered heavily advertises and showcases its **randomizer feature**. As opposed to roguelike inspirations in other games, both the games second chapter and its randomizer mode (unlocked post game) are akin to popular video game mods of the same name (think of Pokemon randomizers, Legend of Zelda randomizers and so on). This feature is meant to be the game's main focus and your overall **enjoyment of this game will HEAVILY depend on whether you enjoy randomizers as a whole**. I for example have never played a randomizer mod before and this game was my first exposure to the gameplay style. To keep my personal opinions short I generally don't like to replay things, and even though I found a lot of interesting and noteworthy designs that I appreciated, (I won't get into randomizer features in general in this review) the feature didn't add anything for me in terms of overall enjoyment to the game. 

- During Chapter 2 (where you are first exposed to the randomizer feature) I was fortunate enough to get a great seed with legendary end game sword spawning right next to me, infinite access to magic keys and gold, an experience trainer etc. It was a good enough seed that I was able to sequence break (very common in the randomizers I've seen on Youtube haha) and beeline for the end boss earlier than what I would have expected to be there. I feel like this moment would have been a monumental one for a **particular person** and they would have been **enamored by it**. However for someone with my tastes, it was a moment of 'oh, that's neat.' This is **subjective**, and I see a world where there will be people on both sides that love a randomizer as a core function and those who won't. Having such a feature as an integrated aspect in a JRPG is a novel and unique premise, I just worry that it **won't be for everyone**. 

Actual in game **combat is alright**. The player character has access to a good variety of usable items and spells that are learned through level progression, the **standard RPG fare**. Outside of  healing and simple status effects (sleep and silence) the game focuses on core damage output/mitigation. Combat is challenging, **emphasizing old school mentality** of not being afraid to punish the player for visiting an area that they're underleveled for and so on. It definitely feels old fashioned, and matches well with the target audience of this game. 

**The game wears its inspiration on its sleeve**. It wears it well mind you, but if someone doesn't care for the aesthetic/gameplay philosophy of the old fashioned JRPGs I'm **not sure if the other systems found in Splintered can carry the enjoyment of the game**. It is definitely a game that is laser focused on its target audience and what it is trying to achieve for better or for worse, even with its quality of life features and smart UI decisions. 

Negative **(spoilers ahead)**:

I **wish there was a journal/log of sorts** for the Quest Items that you find throughout the 1st chapter. So in **chapter 2 the world is randomized**; you are tasked with reaching the end villain again like you did in chapter 1 with the catch being all necessary items that you need to reach the endgame being randomized in different locations. You need a total of **3 different necessary items to progress**, with you having to visit certain locations to upgrade them so you can access the final area. The problem I had with this is that I **didn't remember what quest item did what**, and what I specifically needed during the 2nd chapter. I would find quest items that I found in the previous chapter and think to myself 'oh yeah, what was that for again?'. Going into the menu's help feature doesn't give you help regarding the items, so I spent a good amount of time questioning and wondering what items I needed to bring the shrinekeeper. **Splintered relies on you to remember what you did in the previous chapter** to fit the pieces together. In **other randomizers** that rely on item progression like say a LoZ randomizer quest **item knowledge is colloquial**; usually the player playing the game knows what is needed already to progress the plot and can rely on their own prior knowledge to do so. With this game being new and the first chapter being pretty short it is **very easy to forget what quest items are used for what**. Having say an item that is given to you alongside your weapon piece of equipment when you start (when your alternate self gives it to you) that recorded all of the dialogue that the King told you previously would be really helpful; I feel that having a solid reminder of which quest items are for what wouldn't take away from the wonder of the randomizer.

- On the subject of your **alternate self**, I really **wish** that they weren't portrayed like that and they were a **corpse instead that you could loot off of**. I may be misinterpreting the story but if the main villain wins every chapter and splinters the world so that your alternate version comes to the current dimension, I think it would **add to the stakes if your former self were killed** and you found a piece of equipment and your old journal on your dead body. It would really add to the fear and power of the villain. Right now **my impression of the villain is this silly guy who can bend reality** and sends infinite versions of the main character back in time to other dimensions to do the same thing on repeat.

**A bestiary would have been perfect for this game**. I learned through watching Richard's shorts that **enemies have different traits**, and those traits can also **change along with everything else in the randomizer**. During my playtime of chapter 2 there was a moment where one of the early game enemies (a gem thief) breathed fire at me, an attack that was unique to the end game dragons. I didn't know it at the time but I would reckon there's probably a trait that allows enemies to do that. Not only would a **bestiary give nice flavor text** to the knights and mages etc, but if it could **list the traits of the enemies that were unique to that seed** that would be wonderful. It would allow better planning of what your particular character is in that seed and influence your plan on how to navigate that particular world. Not having one doesn't hurt the game, but I feel including one would benefit Splintered greatly.

I wish there was a **log in the start menu that would keep track of your seeds** and what equipment you started with etc. You can **copy and paste seeds into the randomizer mode** which I think is interesting, but I feel it would be a nice quality of life feature to have **seeds that you've experienced** in game already as **opposed to looking on the internet** for some. It's not really a negative per se, but its something that I feel this game could very much benefit from. 

Conclusion:

Splintered is meant to be a **love letter to a specific type of player**; a player who appreciates the **16 bit era of JRPGs** in both aesthetic and game design as well as **lovers of the randomizer genre** in a modernized package. Priced at a very competitive rate for what it offers, the game does what it wants to do well and is great comfort food for consumers in that audience. The purchase will be justified if the consumer enjoys any of those two facets very strongly, and on the opposing spectrum may be a **disappointing purchase** for those who are **expecting a more traditional JRPG journey**. If the randomizer slant of this game does not appeal to the player, then the amount of content/satisfaction from this title will be limited.

This game is a very, very **specific recommendation for a very specific person**; it is **HIGHLY recommended** that you **try the demo** of this game before you purchase it. However with such a great entry price at $5 it is hard to not steer towards a positive recommendation for the niche that this game desires to fulfill. For example I myself might not find that much replay value from a title such as this. However in contrast the right person might find dozens of hours of enjoyable content from Splintered. As the game continues to be updated and more content continues to be added to not only the campaign but also the randomizer I feel the value proposition will increase higher than other early access titles. With that being said I don't think that changes the specific audience this game is designed for.

On an ending note I feel that it was a **very smart decision** for the developer to make a game like this; I've never heard of an **RPG that satiates this need in the market**. I had so much to say about this game because it was so minimalistic in terms of screenshots and it had a lot to talk about in terms of design haha. **Richard Murtland has done a stellar job** from what I've seen in not only his **promotion** but with his open talks and dialogue about his **design process, feedback and so forth**. The developer has already cultivated a target audience and I can only see this game, and in turn his studio, going up from here. **I'm excited to see what he has in store for the genre in the future**.

I hope everyone is enjoying their week!

I've got the Silmarilion now so I'm going to enjoy reading that, I don't think it should be as hard as everyone says it is just having flicked through it. 

I'm thinking about getting another east Asian tea set. I already have one, but the teapot is a little too big, so I sort of need to plan to use it at the start of the day in order to get the full use out of it. Maybe something smaller would help me reduce the amount if coffee I drink and the suger I put in it. One of those little Japanese/Chinese teapots with the side handle looks fitting. I do like the physical fiddling around making the Gong fu/tea ceremony.

1jjdgck,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jjdgck/aita_for_wanting_to_divorce_my_husband_of_6_years/,AITA for wanting to divorce my husband of 6 years because of his ex?,"Okay Hi. This might be common sense but I do not want to jump to divorce without another opinion and I don't want to tell my family or friends about this yet.

So I (28) F and my husband who I will call Luke (35) M have been married for about 6 years but we have been together (including dating) for 8 years. Luke has always been a very sweet man, very caring and attentive and I would like to say the same for myself.

Let me give a little back story, I was not Luke's first love, he made that very clear when we started seeing each other, his ex gf who I will call Emily and him were together for about 10 years. Emily ended up cheating on Luke, however after what I found out I think he might have some sort of weird connection with her.

Here is where the story starts, Usually I work very late shifts at my job as I am in charge of a whole customer service branch. Yesterday at work I got off early as it was a very slow day. I headed home and when I got there I saw Luke sitting on the couch with an opened shoe box on our coffee table, I made my presence known by telling him hello, instead of saying it back or even showing a little bit of happiness to see me, his face was full of fear. He quite literally scrambled to close this shoe box and quickly stood up with it and went to our bedroom. I was extremely confused so I followed and called out asking if everything was okay as I entered our bedroom he shoving this box under our bed. I asked him what it was but he told me it had a gift for me in it and that he didn't want me to see it. I brushed it off and said okay, he begged me not to look in it and I told him I wouldn't. Our day continued like usually (dinner, movie) just casual things. Luke ended up falling asleep as we were watching avatar, and my gut told me to look in the box (Thank God.) and I did.

In the box was pictures of him and his ex, bracelets, key chains, and the weirdest thing was our wedding photo but he cut my face out and put hers in it. Emily and I looked very similar but I always thought he just had a type but now looking back it seems like he was trying to use me as a replacement.

Anyways, I obviously confronted Luke. I was pissed to say the least, I woke him up by throwing a cup of water on him (I know this wasn't right) however he completely tried to blame me because I looked in the box, telling me I told him I wouldn't. of course I didn't let this fly, I told him he was micro cheating on me and he got sooo mad at me for saying that, he ended up throwing our couch pillow at me which I threw back at him. We had a very heated argument to say the least.

After the argument Luke left the house for a little bit and I unfortunately gave way to my emotions and had a whole crying moment (I am not a big crier, I typically hold it in.) When Luke had came home after a few hours, he was extremely apologetic, he threw out the whole shoe box and told me doesn't want to lose me. However I feel like this is too far and that this broke my trust in him and our whole marriage. I don't want to make an impulsive decision but I also don't want to be with someone who is obsessed with their ex. I ended up telling Luke I was going to stay at my moms house for the night. Now I am here, a day later and I have not talked to Luke despite the numerous phone calls and texts (Which I might show because I feel like its manipulative.)

I know this is short and it does lack a lot of detail that I will probably share later. I just honestly do not know what to do right now. I will come back to this post and give it an update soon, I just wanted a second opinion on this situation.",7,1742885863.0,AITAH,14,1.0,False

I was fidgetting with it for about a minute, pretending to fix my coffee since there were other people in the room, and just couldn't figure out how to get it to stay closed. This is just an example, but there have been so many times where I've felt like tasks that should be simple, I struggle with. It's like my brain just shuts off when there's something I know should be simple, and this especially seems to happen when there are other people in the room, which is even worse. Part of the reason I'm hard on myself when it comes to this kind of thing is because I've always been gifted academically, and it feels like I'm completely stupid when it comes to actual problem solving of any kind, and all I'm good at mentally is retaining information. I love learning, I just wish I didn't feel like I have tostruggle with real world things that come easily to other people just from common sense. I feel like everyone around me believes I'm stupid because of this and just is too kind to say it to me, as they're very patient with me.

1jjdccv,https://i.redd.it/i7wv63yx8sqe1.jpeg,What I read to participate in Middle Grade March as a full-time software engineer to get back into reading,"Long time lurker here,
I have always been a voracious reader and read a lot especially between the years of 2019-2023. But turned out, 2024 was not a reading year for me, well, I still read around 13 books the previous year, and I wanted to dedicate more time to reading.

I decided to participate in readathon which happens ever year called ‚ÄòMiddle Grade March‚Äô and grabbed the opportunity to read the books matching the prompts. Turned out to be a good reading month.

For context, I work as a full-time software engineer who works around 8-10 hours a day. I dedicate anywhere between 2-3 hours of reading. Weekends can be around 4-6 hours.

Some might think the choices of picked here are too juvenile, but sometimes you need those easy reading book to challenge yourself into reading the more complex and challenging books.

The books in frames were as mentioned in the title, middle grade. Hence reading these books was easier, hence the number of books. I consider myself a medium paced reader, and most of the books in frame in the ballpark of 300 pages long, with fairly larger font. Took me about 5-6 hours to finish a book in the span of 3-4 days.

Without giving any spoilers, I wanted to give a one-liner if any of these pique interest and especially if you are going through a reading slump. From bottom to up:

1. The Wild Robot(Peter Brown)- An elementary grade read about a robot stranded on a non-human inhibited island. Great of children under 10 if you want your kids to get into reading. Genre: Sci-fi

2. Clarice the Brave (Lisa McMann)-A middle grade read about sibling relationship of two ship mice who get separated. Comes with slight trigger warnings. Genre: Magical Realism

3. Anne of Green Gables (L.M. Montgomery) - A classic middle grade about an orphaned girl Anne who gets adopted and starts life in Price Edward Island. Go for this book if you like character driven books with great visual descriptions of places. Genre: Classic

4. Lasagna Means I love you(Katie O‚ÄôShagunessy)- Middle grade read about a recently orphaned girl who is on her way to discover new hobby and family. Genre: Lit Fic. 

5. Pages of Co, Tilly and the Book Wanderers (Anne James)- Again a middle grade about a girl who discovers she has the magical abilities to literally travel through books and between stories. Genre: Fantasy

6. Legends and Lattes (Travis Baldree) - A high fantasy, low stakes read for someone who loved cozy vibes and ESPECIALLY Coffee. Would put this in Adult category because children would most likely get bored of this kind of book easily. Genre: Fantasy

7. The Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches(Sanghu Mandanna)- Low fantasy about a witch who is asked to tutor 3 little witches. Again, this book like the previous one is pure cozy and whimsy vibes only with beautiful description of place. Genre: Fantasy

If you made it this far, thank you for tolerating my blabber about the aforementioned books.

1jjdc6l,https://i.redd.it/jxifyc8v8sqe1.jpeg,What I read to participate in Middle Grade March as a full-time software engineer to get back into reading,"Long time lurker here,
I have always been a voracious reader and read a lot especially between the years of 2019-2023. But turned out, 2024 was not a reading year for me, well, I still read around 13 books the previous year, and I wanted to dedicate more time to reading.

I decided to participate in readathon which happens ever year called ‚ÄòMiddle Grade March‚Äô and grabbed the opportunity to read the books matching the prompts. Turned out to be a good reading month.

For context, I work as a full-time software engineer who works around 8-10 hours a day. I dedicate anywhere between 2-3 hours of reading. Weekends can be around 4-6 hours.

Some might think the choices of picked here are too juvenile, but sometimes you need those easy reading book to challenge yourself into reading the more complex and challenging books.

The books in frames were as mentioned in the title, middle grade. Hence reading these books was easier, hence the number of books. I consider myself a medium paced reader, and most of the books in frame in the ballpark of 300 pages long, with fairly larger font. Took me about 5-6 hours to finish a book in the span of 3-4 days.

Without giving any spoilers, I wanted to give a one-liner if any of these pique interest and especially if you are going through a reading slump. From bottom to up:

1. The Wild Robot(Peter Brown)- An elementary grade read about a robot stranded on a non-human inhibited island. Great of children under 10 if you want your kids to get into reading. Genre: Sci-fi

2. Clarice the Brave (Lisa McMann)-A middle grade read about sibling relationship of two ship mice who get separated. Comes with slight trigger warnings. Genre: Magical Realism

3. Anne of Green Gables (L.M. Montgomery) - A classic middle grade about an orphaned girl Anne who gets adopted and starts life in Price Edward Island. Go for this book if you like character driven books with great visual descriptions of places. Genre: Classic

1jjdc1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/SPTV_Unvarnished/comments/1jjdc1v/reese_says_earthshattering_heavy_things_may_cause/,"Reese says ""earth-shattering"" heavy things may cause her not to stream as much","Reese says she talked to some friends today and she's not feeling like doing streams on her channel at this point. She claims that she has been advised not to talk about why she won't be streaming and says she's struggling in different areas. She says she only streams because she wants to, which means that she doesn't need people's views or superchats to support herself. Otherwise, she would be treating YouTube like the job she claims it is. It's not like Reese prepares visuals or clips or does any research for her streams. She almost always just goes live without a topic.   
  
Tonight one of Reese's mods posted a link to Reese's Shopping Collection page on YouTube where viewers can buy some of Reese's favorite products, but she left out the fact that Reese gets a commission from everything fans buy there. Sometimes when that link is posted, a mod will admit that ""RR"" gets a piece of those sales, but Reese never just says ""Hey everybody, you can support me by buying things from my Shopping Collection and here's the link"" because if she did that, she'd have to admit to a lot of loyal chatters that she lied to them all the times she has said she wished she could get kickbacks from companies. She also lied many times when people asked if there was any other way they could support her. Reese and her mods have tried to be very sneaky and hush-hush about the money Reese makes from this Shopping Collection. Her chatters need to realize she has a lot more money than they have been led to believe.   
  
Also, this is H's spring break and it's almost April but Reese hasn't said a word about H starting his baseball lessons that fans gave so much money for him to take. Poor H.   
  
She says a lot of things have gone on behind the scenes that have really rocked her. Reese often says her life is an open book, but streams like this make it clear that's not true. Hopefully more of her fans will wake up to that.

Reese says she's been really leaning into her friends lately, adding that's something she's only been able to understand recently. She says she's really out of sorts and she feels like she's swimming through mud sometimes. She's doing hard-core sadfishing but she's being extra vague about it so her chat is expressing a lot of concern but no superchats have come in yet.   
  
""There are some things that I just found out that I can't talk about and I'm really blown away by,"" she says. ""I suddenly feel like crying. It's just that every time I feel like I've hit the bottom, somebody throws me a shovel."" A chatter guesses that Tommy has been in contact with her. Reese says no. Another chatter guesses that Reese is pregnant and she says no and that she's on her period and that her period came early. Another chatter guesses that it's legal stuff and Reese says potentially it is. Maybe the investigation into Jeff's guns is finally heating up. Reese says the things that are happening are heavy and that they make her very sad. She says it's not a Jester thing and that it has nothing to do with her YouTube channel.   
  
""If you don't see me, don't call for a wellness check,"" she says, adding that if people don't see her for a while, she's physically safe. She's really backing away from saying that Tommy and Johnny might kill her or that the Jesters might be after her.   
  
She's trying to cry but it's not working. She tells her chat not to worry about her or H. She says she'll be on her Zoom call for top-tier members this month. She says what she's dealing with has nothing to do with her stepdad.   
  
A chatter asks Reese if she has texted with Adam again. That's the guy who walked into her livestream this weekend at the flea market and then she flirted with him a lot. Reese says she doesn't think Adam was as into her as she thought so she has more healing to do.

Reese says no one is scaring her with legal action. She says she comes on way too strong with both men and women, reminding people how she grilled the cook at the cafe on camera with a lot of very personal questions right after meeting her. She says she doesn't regret her encounters with people and that if she's too much for people, they should just stop watching her. ""I'm going to stay true to my integrity,"" she says. ""I don't think I'm too much.""   
  
Reese says she has 5.1 million views on her channel now. She's not telling her fans that she got rid of a lot of videos and cost herself half a million views earlier this month.   
  
One of Reese's ""friends"" who drove to meet her months ago and bring her a blanket and truffle cheese is one of the few who is still consistently giving Reese money publicly. She already gave Reese money to help buy furniture this weekend and tonight she sent Reese another superchat. A few other people have sent her small superchats, asking her to buy a coffee drink or a lip stain with the money. People do that sometimes when they're trying to cheer Reese up.   
  
A chatter asks about the rumors that Reese and Tommy are back together. Reese says if that were true, she'd be having multiple orgasms and she wouldn't be such a bitch. Then she catches herself and tells her audience that there were a lot of other problems with Tommy. She's been trying to convince people lately that her relationship with Tommy is what turned her into a bitch. She says tonight that she and Tommy are not talking. A chatter says the rumor is that she's running back to Tommy to get money. Reese says money is not a problem, which is wild because she's been saying that Tommy owes her thousands of dollars and that she can't afford to keep her house at a comfortable temperature or get Gertie's teeth cleaned.

She says she grew up around money so she doesn't care about it that much. She says she knew all about the money that Tommy is allegedly getting for his YouTube channel long before she ever did the video exposing him as a con man. She says she got out of controlling, abusive situations with both Tommy and Jeff. She shows a picture of the porch furniture that chatters bought for her this weekend and she says she doesn't miss Jeff's money even though she has to put some things on credit cards now.   
  
Reese says she's hearing about other YouTubers who are making mistakes and she says she's not going to change what she does. She says when her channel isn't fun for her, she won't stream.   
  
Reese starts reading a text from someone who tells her that she needs to look at her male relationships and how she wants to be loved so much that no matter how small the interaction is with a man, she spins it into a romance in her head. ""I think you did this with Tommy,"" the texter says, adding that otherwise Reese probably wouldn't have dated a felon who has a long history of drug abuse and no money to speak of. The texter talks about how Reese's father abandoned her over and over again and how her mom left her too so Reese can't trust women either. Scientology never allowed Reese to have any power or control so she doesn't trust her own judgment and so she's attracted to controlling men, the texter says.   
  
A bunch of Reese's chatters are bashing what that texter wrote but Reese says she thinks that texter's words were pretty accurate. Reese says this texter is a friend of hers and that she doesn't think her words were too harsh.   
  
Reese says Adam texted her ""Happy Monday"" today so she thinks she pushed too hard with him and says she'd like to be his friend and go out with him but if that doesn't happen, it's fine.

She says she thinks it will take a special guy to be in a relationship with her because she gets so personal on her YouTube channel.   
  
She claims that some of the things that have come to light recently are ""earth-shattering"" and that they don't have anything to do with her family. She says she's mad at herself that she didn't see those things before because she talked herself out of believing the truth earlier. ""I'm mad that I was so naive,"" she says.   
  
She says she doesn't share everything with her channel. She only shares what she wants people to know. She says she hates gossip and she doesn't want to hate-bond with people. She claims she'll never out anyone's dark secrets just because she's mad or disappointed with them. She says she's never going to ""spill the tea"" even if she only has 10 subscribers left. There's so much hunger for gossip, she says, and that's why she doesn't want to stream right now.   
  
Reese says she equates sex with being in love. She says she used to tell Tommy that she wanted him to love her as much as she loved him.   
  
Reese claims that the owner of the cafe texted her and told her that Reese gets mentioned a lot in her store and that someone drove an hour and a half to get to the cafe because of Reese.   
  
She says she will probably be back tomorrow and she's not quitting, but if she's not in a good mental place, she doesn't want to stream. She says she doesn't want to be a bummer.

I was given 8 patients, one of them being someone I had looked after last week in ICU

I‚Äôve never seen a ward as horribly managed as this one, I was getting slammed left and right with IVABs, blood product orders, multiple heparin infusions therefore just as many APTT checks, potassium levels I rarely even see in ICU therefore KCL after KCL

8 lots of complex would care plans with patients SCREAMING during their dressing changes with the given analgesics doing fk all

Patients screaming at me because I forgot their coffee, because I didn‚Äôt bring them the cotton buds, because they‚Äôre still waiting on me to shower them 

Managers telling me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre from ICU you‚Äôll handle it‚Äù when I categorically told them that I felt unsafe and that I needed help

Going back to the patient I knew - the poor angel looked worse than the last time I saw her, Hb, K+, lactate, pH etc. literally EVERYTHING was out of whack, she wasn‚Äôt even eating, talking coherently, work of breathing so wild you can hear it from outside the room

So while I‚Äôm busy trying to reach a doctor for orders and a plan, AGAIN I get yelled at for not getting someone a coffee, an independent patient getting discharged üôÇ GET YOUR OWN COFFEE the kitchen is right there

Ward nurses are the true troopers, I feel emotional and numb at the same time, I feel guilty for not delivering the best care I know I can deliver and if this was my day to day shift I would simply not be a nurse

And truely, this is not a jab at our nurses, this a whole systemic issue, I cannot believe the disparities of resources and good management between different specialties

I know I sound like a complaining little princess but I wouldn‚Äôt wish this type of work environment on anyone, this is burn out 101

Growing up I did not know I had a biological father. I figured it out when I was 11 and realized that my younger sibling who had yet to be born was not going to have the same last name as me. I began to ask questions and I did not like the answers so I went and found my birth certificate. It listed a name someone other than the person I call Dad. Then, I found out my Dad had been around since I was 2. He would eventually adopt me when I was 13 (it was a bit of a mess but it got done). 

After my adoption and then eventually turning 18; I still did not have any desire to get to know my biological father. I found out a few things about him and knew that my mom had gotten a restraining order when I was young but not much else. I had seen him in public a few times as my mom pointed him out to me as he was the cable installer assigned to my parent‚Äôs neighborhood. 

So, this past Christmas when I was visiting my parents for the holidays. He knocks on the door. I answer and tell him that I would like him to leave but he asks if I can go for coffee. He agrees and during coffee time to he tells me that he has retired and is now getting a divorce and he would not like to live with any more regrets so he wants to get to know me. We talk a bit more and exchange numbers. I tell him I have a lot to process and I am not ready or in a place for a relationship but I will eventually contact him. It might be a month or a year but I will contact him and appears reluctant.

The next day is Christmas Eve and he texts me that wants to go shopping and to church. I tell him the same thing I told him yesterday that I am not ready and I will text him when I am ready. 

I tell my mom about everything that has happened and she looks like she is about to have a panic attack. Also, that he was not respecting my boundaries (she was not surprised). So she asked me to give my dad his number. I give the number to my dad and he explains to him that if he comes back uninvited that will be trespassing and if he continues to contact me after I clearly communicate what I wanted that I could pull a restraining order. He sends me a text two hours after my dad sent him a text message and suddenly agrees to give me space. I think this is all over with and have a nice holiday with my family. My birthday comes a few months later and he sends me a birthday message about how he has always wanted to tell me happy birthday and says some other things. I decided that I did not want to deal with any of this at the current moment and blocked his number. The next day, I decide that therapy will be helpful and so I go in a few weeks. 

So, I am wondering how has any adoptee dealt with a biological parent contacting them out of nowhere and did they establish a relationship or not? ",2,1742884902.0,Adoption,0,1.0,False

1jjd63c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/1jjd63c/idk_what_to_title/,Idk what to title,"Following is a longish vent ramble about my grandmother. It includes several triggering topics so be wary. 

I've never made a post on Reddit before, and I am not the most articulate. I am 19 (Gender non-conforming, AFAB, no drivera license) and my  maternal grandmother (67) has stage four lung cancer. This will mostly be rambling and I apologize in advance, I doubt I'll cover everything. 

My Nana got her diagnoses sometime early this year and it's been extremely difficult. In 2020 she battled stage three colon/rectal cancer and won, but after 40+ years of smoking- her lung couldn't hold up. 

My family- elder sister (22), Nana, mother (44), and my stepfather (46) all moved from Sacramento, California to central Ohio per my mother's wish to live close to her best friend. We've lived here for 2-3 years now. 

Following her diagnoses my mother approached me on needing more help this time around as I was no longer the 15 year old who was kept away from bad situations. I accepted, but as I struggle with multiple of my own issues (Autism, ADHD, anxiety, depression, CPTSD, and an undiagnosed full body chronic illness effecting my joints and lungs that has been labeled Fibromalagia) I expressed I might not be able to help as much as I wished. My mother did not like this and we ended up fighting as my mother spoke of my sister not being reliable. This is true as my sister was busy starting working and got herself a boyfriend she spent most of her time with. I myself was busy with college and starting to work part-time.

This leads to early this year. At first my Nana could do things for herself as in she could function with minimal support, and was as she'd always been. On the quieter side, stubborn, but sweet when she wanted to be. A spitfire. 

She got COVID and had to be hospitalized due to it. After returning home she was alright, but now was reliant on an large oxygen machine I carried up and down the stairs while she worked her remote banking job. 

Then the flu hit. 

Another hospital visit, but when she came back this time it was in a severe decline. She ended up falling- tripping on some of her clothing and ended up breaking her left wrist in the very very early morning hours and needing to go to the hospital where they soft-splinted it. (A week later they casted it per her request.)

Over the span of a month she has had severe mental decline, forgetfulness, impatience, and her demeanor changed. She began spending money, thousands upon thousands of dollars worth of furniture and packages began to arrive. At this point in time she had already lashed out at my mother and I as my sister was still gone most of the time and my mother and stepfather began to seperate. (Though admittedly he wasn't much help with my Nana to begin with, wonderful guy with a big heart though)

TRIGGER WARNING: She would speak of things like bringing up her past sexual assault, memories of my maternal grandfather's actions (he molested my older cousin when she was a child, died the day of the court hearings from complications with alcoholism), memories of my uncle (who committed suicide ~8 years ago). She would bring these moments up randomly or in places were it wasn't appropriate, like talking about the incidents with my cousin, my uncle's daughter. 

Some other misc incidents: lying about her capabilities to medical professionals, difficulties with technology when she hadn't had any previously, mostly waking me up and calling exclusively me for help in the late night and early mornings and on.

The Febuary the 16th was when it came to a head. She was angry and ended up taking it out at my mother, assaulting her and throwing coffee on her after bruising and scratching her face. My mother is ex-military, she led her to her recliner and sat her down while phoning the police, I myself was jolted awake by my mother and went downstairs to let the police in. 

The morning my Nana had apparently called her hometown's police department to report her sexual assault, and incident that happened over 60 years ago with the perpetrator, her grandfather (?) dead for 40 years now). There was a disagreement that led to my Nana throwing coffee all over my mother and throwing the ceramic cup at her head. The cops were called. When let inside they talked with me in the garage where I had vocal recordings of my Nana admitting what she'd done. The second cop was upstairs talking to my mother. Due to my Nana being seen right then she screamed and shattered a very sentimental cup on the floor. The tl;dr is she was taken to the ER but wasn't kept, returning home with my mother's best friend driving her as my Nana has vertigo and hasn't driven herself since my mother was a teenager. 

My cousins visited, my uncle's daughter and her two children alongside my cousin's sister. They were kept watchful around my Nana incase of any more violent physical outbursts

Around that incident were the financial arguments, the scams on her bank account and not being able to navigate her phone any more, the new electronics and furniture and appliances purchased and it all led up to Georgia. Georgia was a 8-week old purebred French bulldog puppy my Nana bought of the internet after being advised against it by my mother, memories, and her doctor as the woman can barely look after herself. 

Here we are now. I am still constantly relied on, my mother and Nana are distant and my body is breaking down, and my Nana has been caught smoking a cigarette or two. I can no longer handle the mental aspect or physical aspect. I've had to use walking aids along with the increase in my meds, but the urges to take myself out have only grown stronger. 

Does anyone have any tips for me? I am currently seeing my therapist around once a week but I barely get $200 a week at my job and most of it goes to my phone bills and therapy.

So much stems in my mind from the one word ‚Äúflower(s)‚Äù, I think about the time where I stopped by Safeway before heading home and helped this lovely elder lady pick out some flowers for an event. We spoke for 15 minutes straight in the flower area before we said bye. I want a lot of things I may never get while I am alive. In my 17 years of breathing on earth I haven‚Äôt been given flowers by a lover or in general. Actually once. I still have them in my room and they are like 2 years dry. But I definitely will be buying those huge miffy lamps for my future apartment. Truthfully, I know some people despise matcha. But the moment I tasted matcha I knew I was matcha‚Äôs bitch and matcha could give me backshots cause Wowwww.. Also caffeine has me in a chokehold. I pour ice into a glass and I mix creamer and milk together and I seperately stir coffee with honey and water and then I pour it into the glass w ice and milk and then mix. It‚Äôs so good i love coffee i love caffeine i love tea I also love drinking something while having a video playing in the back. The semi-tiny daily things that occur throughout my day are actually kinda productive to me. I want to begin journaling in my diary consistently again. Also need to throw away or completely get a new diary because my old one is so depressing I can‚Äôt open her up at ALL I was writing like slenderman up in that bitch I cant make it up why was my writing so scribbly? I love ambient light and I love bright lighting at too at the same time. Specifically when it makes me cover it with my hands or my arms immidiately because then I feel like an angel entering the gates of heaven for the first time. Listening to Mazzy Star i love my mazzy star cd and I must start collecting cds again soon!!! I used to go to the bins to get a load of them to discover new artists and I met someone a month or two ago who happened to listen to one of the artists whos cd I had and we bonded. I am currently laying in bed with no blanket covering me because In truth, I‚Äôm not sweaty I just don‚Äôt want to be warm. I hung the napkin with writing my grandmother gave me from Mexico. I‚Äôll insert a photo. Next to that I have baby photos of my sister, college acceptance letters, a college poster, polaroids, and a portrait that has a knitted flower in it. I can see myself living in San Francisco and I think I want to go there for college. The thought of it makes my stomach twist because I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm capable but I don‚Äôt want to second guess myself. I am scared of becoming an adult and growing up. Not so scared of turning 18, just some of the hard to grasp realities that come with it. Nvm i cant insert a photo :/",1,1742883888.0,u_back2mi,0,1.0,False
