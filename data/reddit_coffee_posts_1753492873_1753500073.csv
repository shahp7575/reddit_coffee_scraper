I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid. The vastness of regional differences that history and media introduced me to swept me away, making me endlessly fascinated in what many things this world seemed to have out there to be discovered and experienced. That was back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from halfway across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. Since then, I've been fortunate enough to have met people to exchange with, and I'd like to see if I can find that again.

I'm looking for someone that I first and foremost have a connection with. My ideal is to actually get to know my penpal. Location doesn't matter as much, as who that person is defines whether I'd like to engage with them or not. I do have a preference for cultural exchange, in which we can be introduced to different and new things. But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpalling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. That being said, I'm increasingly interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be more open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into another or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time, so let's start with what works best for us.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you?

I'm 34, male, and live in the US (Michigan). Thoroughly introverted, with a deep desire to engage with those who can tap into that aspect of me. My personality is designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation. I'm potentially interested in many things with the right people and in the right environments, but left to my own devices, I always come back to the same core things.

*I strive to engage in genuine and thoughtful discussion.* Cognitive vibes are key for me. I do best with abstract minds that peak with ideation and whimsy, but don't think I'm so limited. Compatibility is a strange thing that feels most real when it's too fluid to be defined. We're compilations of potential that spark and enhance through engagement.

*Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine.* I'm an autodidact who's been passionate about a variety of pursuits since I've been young. I'm most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, but also that a lack or limitation is highly limiting. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me.* Personally, I write; about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

*I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee.* I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted.",1,1753499857.0,penpalsover30,0,1.0,False
1m9ixk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1m9ixk8/aio_boyfriend_does_harmless_but_confusingrude/,AIO Boyfriend does harmless but confusing/rude things?,"I can’t tell if I’m just super reactive or expecting too much but the things my boyfriend of 8 months baffles me. Both mid 30s. Sorry this is so long - I didn’t intend it to be. 

When we first started dating and I’d go over to his place, he’d often eat snacks or food without offering me any. Like we’d be hanging out and then he’d go to his kitchen and come back just munching on nuts or crackers and cheese. One time, we’d just come back from a night out and were talking in his car and my stomach growled and I was like “oh I’m so hungry.” Then we went inside his place and I went to the bathroom. When I came out, he was just eating a bowl of cereal. It upset me because he knew I was hungry and didn’t even offer anything AND was just eating in front of me. That was the first time I confronted him about it and he listened and made sure to at least offer me food from then on.

2. Besides not offering me food, he would also help himself to snacks I would bring. It rubbed me the wrong way because he wouldn’t ever offer me any but then has the gall to just open my bag of chips and eat them? He also just grabs food from my plate without asking. One time, we went to a restaurant and I got a margarita and he didn’t want one. However, he would just reach over and drink it.

3. Last weekend we went to his good friends wedding. We flew to the location and were there for 3 days. First night, we go to a bar for a pre-wedding shindig. I let him know that I understood he’d be seeing some friends and would be catching up, but to please remember to at least introduce me and not leave me standing there like an idiot. He did ok with that. However, we went outside the venue to just get some air and this random drunk old woman (total stranger) came up to him and made a dumb “how many lightbulbs” joke. She kept interacting but only talking to him, with her back to me. I hoped he’d eventually deflect, but instead he kept on engaging and asking follow up questions?? So I walked away around the corner and sat on the curb to chill. 10 minutes later he texts me to tell me he’s inside. But why didn’t he ASK where I was? Why didn’t he end the convo and try to follow me sooner? I confronted him about it and he said he didn’t know how to end the convo and didn’t notice she was ignoring me. And when I asked if he even looked for me, he said he did, but ended up revealing he wasn’t even sure which direction I had walked. 
4. Day after wedding, we are getting ready to check out. He says he’s going to go across the street to get us coffee and pastries from a cafe as I get ready. I tell him I’d love a croissant or something savory. He’s gone for like 20 min and texts saying cafe was closed and he was waiting at McDonald’s to get stuff. He comes back with 1 large McDonald’s coffee and a small paper bag. He sets it down and goes to finish packing. I’m confused and look at the bag and it’s just 1 hash brown. I say “oh so you got a hash brown?” And he says he didn’t know what to get and didn’t really wanna get anything else so he just got that. I ask him if it’s for him or me or?… and he gives a confusing answer I can’t even remember because it doesn’t answer my question. Regardless, it’s 1 hashbrown and I’m sure it’s for him only. I ask why he didn’t get 2 at least, why he didn’t call me to ask what I wanted, and if it was for both of us (already ridiculous), why he didn’t mention “hey I got a hash brown for us”? He doesn’t know how to answer and just keeps talking in roundabout ways trying to avoid a direct answer. 

I am baffled by these events. I clearly try to address these things and I feel like a mom scolding him at times. He doesn’t ever answer directly. I feel like he gets defensive but in a very passive way that makes me feel bad because he just acts helpless or clueless. ",1,1753499803.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False
1m9ivu3,https://i.redd.it/st97neuoy4ff1.png,Found my new Saturday night obsession in Prospect Lefferts Gardens,"So I've been hitting up these Saturday comedy shows at Brooklyn Perk and honestly didn't expect much - figured it'd be like open mic night at some dive bar. But damn, these comedians are actually legit. We're talking people who've been on HBO, Comedy Central, Don't Tell Comedy... performing in this cozy coffee shop backyard for like 15 bucks.

The whole setup is perfect - starts at 8pm, ends by 9:30 so you're not out super late, and they've got AC inside if it gets too hot. Plus drinks are included in the ticket price which is clutch in this economy lol.

Last week this comic had the entire crowd losing it with stories about dating in Brooklyn - felt like hanging with friends who happen to be hilarious. Way better than scrolling TikTok on a Saturday night.

If you're in the area and looking for something different to do, definitely worth checking out. It's at Brooklyn Perk on Parkside Ave. Only reason I'm posting is because I want this to keep happening and they need people to show up!

Anyone else been? The crowd really does feel like a neighborhood hangout but with professional-level comedy.

1m9ivj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1m9ivj1/office_job_vs_barista_dream_feeling_stuck_and/,"Office job vs barista dream, feeling stuck and guilty","Hi, lurker here. I (25F) am looking for advice on how to move forward.

For most of my life, I’ve struggled to find something that truly interested me. I never had that “spark” that motivates some people to go above and beyond. Since I was a kid, I’ve lived with a “one day at a time” mentality. I ended up choosing a major without job prospects (I studied Sociology... not the wisest choice in a third-world country), and during university I worked in restaurants to support myself and my family.

It was during those jobs that I found myself working behind the drink bar, making coffee, and that’s when I found it: something that genuinely made me happy.

I worked as a barista for almost four years and got really damn good at it. The more I learned, the more I realized how I green I was. In the past, that kind of challenge would have overwhelmed me, make me drop everything on the sopt: but not this time. I pushed through, met amazing people, learned so many things. Even on the hardest days, in the most exploitative jobs (had a few lmao), I felt fulfilled.

For the first time in my life, I had a dream: to dedicate myself to the world of coffee.

But life got in the way.

This year, my longtime boyfriend and I are finally moving out together. My country is going through a rough economic moment, and barista work doesn’t pay enough, also its unreliable. My body was already suffering from the physical strain, especially at my last job, where I had to run up and down eight floors just to collect mugs left by office workers. (Still, this was the best job I've ever had)

A few months ago, my best friend told me about an opening in her office. She offered me the position. It was a tough decision but I figured that having a stable office job with better pay would help me move forward, get our own place, and maybe even get married next year.

I started working at the office a month ago. It’s not bad, and it’s not hard... but it’s depressing. Sitting in a cubicle, replying to emails all day, it just drains me. Still, the pay raise was significant, and if I pass the trial period, I’ll earn even more.

I told myself I’d do this for a while, save up, and maybe one day go back to coffee.

But today, by pure chance, I ran into the boss of my ex-boss. She told me they’re opening a new store, and they’ll be serving alcoholic drinks too—which got me really excited, since I’ve been wanting to learn mixology. I told her I left because of money, and she asked me to send my CV. Her boss wants to make me an offer.

And now I feel stuck.

I feel like I owe my friend this job. Technically, I took her place, she’s training me so she can move up in the company. If I leave now, she might get stuck until they find someone else reliable, and from what i've seen, getting into this company is \*hard\*. Getting the job was *hell,* the interview process was awful, the boss is a nightmare (thank god i relaly don't see her at all, she works at homeoffice and doesn't get involved in our department at all). But now I also have a shot at going back to something I actually love.

I know the coffee job would pay significantly less, as baristas aren’t well paid where I live. Also, it's not a simple job either, you have to make a lot of physical movement and I've had some leg injuries that make it really hard to stay standing for long periods of time. And I don’t want to let down my boyfriend either; we’ve both been working hard for a stable future.

I just feel so lost right now. I know I should at least hear the offer and see if it’s viable... but I’m scared of letting everyone down if I leave. And scared of letting *myself* down if I stay.

Any advice is appreciated.",1,1753499629.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

I wore the $15 necklace you got me even after we ended, and cried for weeks when someone stole it from me.

We are not the same

You deleted all the photos, the messages, the plushies and trinkets I bought when I thought of you.. as if wanting to erase me from your memory

I still have the movie stub from our first date in that box, along with our photos, the coffee stained promposal letter and every origami rose and flower you use to make for me back then

We are not the same

You opened yourself up to other bodies already… maybe even recently after, and yet it took you years after we started dating to open up to me in that way.. 

I scrubbed myself in my shower until I bled after another person tried to touch me that wasn’t you. And I’ve waited years after you left to see if you’d maybe come back.. 

We are not the same

You left believing the grass would get greener, that theres better out there, things would get easier, and maybe they did… maybe simplicity is what suits you best.

I stayed and nurtured the very patch you were unsatisfied with and trampled over and over again. In time it flourished and grew into the garden of my dreams, complete with life and flowers that I thought had died ages ago

We are not the same

You rushed out of our connection, hoped the distractions and the drugs and the negativity and lust would help you to forget me and make you forget what you did to me. You hoped in time you’d feel nothing. 


I stayed back, I scraped and cleaned all the gunk you left inside me, left around me. I paused every time there was a piece that was stuck on there good. I was patient with myself, self loving. I felt everything. Everything that I needed to and when I needed to. And I realize now that…

1m9isz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1m9isz3/if_you_are_poor_but_not_a_prude_these_tips_will/,"If you are poor but not a prude, these tips will help you save some $$.","1. Whether you live in a house or an apartment:

Pee in the bathtub: Every time you pee & flush, you literally piss away 1 to 1.5 GALLONS of water. This can add up to 7-10 gallons per person PER DAY! Or 210 to  300 gallons per month PER PERSON! If you are a larger household, that’s anywhere from 300 to 1000 gallons per household!

I am a female. I squat & pee in a wide mouth jar that either goes to the plants in the garden (I grow my own veggies, fruit trees & ornamental plants) or is just poured over the heap of free wood chips in the backyard. In the winters, I often just pour it down the bathtub drain followed by just 1 quart of water to clear the “P-trap seal depth”. That way any pee left in that U-shaped section will be forced out by the water & won’t smell. Google “Bathtub Plumbing Installation Drain Diagrams” to see what that looks like. Plumbers know what I’m talking about.

I learnt this while composting our poop after taking a humanure-making course (permaculture). Our water bill went from $150 per month to $75 per month.

Want to take it a step further? Only shower every other day, if you don’t sweat like crazy or go to the gym daily. Just use a small towel & wipe your pits, under boobs, groin (any place you sweat) with soapy water & again with just water. You’ll be saving at least 10 gallons of water every time you do that (about 1500 gallons a month!).

  
2. If you live in an apartment:

Tape Mylar sheets (shiny side facing out!) on your south & west facing windows during summer. Or any window that lets in a lot of sun. This will dramatically reduce heat gain & lower your electricity bill.

However, if you live in a house & if you don’t care about “ugly”, you can also just hang mylar sheets from the lip of your south & west facing gutters (shiny side facing out!) because they are really light. Use clothes pins. This will literally act like a radiant barrier & prevent everything (including walls!) from absorbing any radiation. The temperature difference will blow your mind. I did this as an experiment in architecture undergrad & could not believe my eyes when we did before & after temperature readings. This is best done during extreme heat so that you don’t make enemies of your prudish neighbors :)



3. Whether you live in a house or an apartment (For dry, hot climates):

If you do not have AC or swamp coolers and are getting really hot, move to a north facing room, if you have one. Take a long sleeve shirt or dress, dunk in water, wring it out, wear it & lie in front of a fan going at full speed. Repeat a few times till your body cools down. It’s called transevaporative cooling & it works FAST! 

If you live in a humid climate & have a heat wave, consider buying a dehumidifier which you run with a separate fan (while wearing wet clothes). Humidity can be really dangerous during heat waves!

In an emergency (if you do not have an AC), please seek shelter with a friend who has an AC, a fire station, coffee shop, department store or hospital emergency room.



4. Whether you live in a house or an apartment (For cold seasons):

Buy a hot water bottle to take with you to bed. It will keep you warm for a VERY long time. Don’t overfill it. Wear socks, sweater & a warm hat/ear muffs as soon as you get out of bed. If you have gel packs, heat them in the microwave for 1 minute each it put them into the pockets of your sweaters/sweatshirts. They will radiate heat for a good while. Careful to not get them too hot. Repeat as needed.

This allows us to keep our heat at 57 F the whole of winter & STILL be toasty! We have an oil furnace & my conversations with the oil delivery guy are always hilarious. He cannot understand how we survive with so little oil. He worked on an oil rig in Alaska & cannot handle anything less than 70F.

If you HATE getting out of your blankets cold, buy a small stand-alone room heater with a remote control. Turn it on for 10 minutes before you get out of bed so you don’t feel the cold bite you like a dog. All the rest as above.



5. Whether you live in a house or an apartment (For dry, hot climates):

This is for women (Whether you live in a house or an apartment)-

You can cut up old cotton clothes, fold them & use them as sanitary pads (no need to sew the edges). I do this whenever I am working from home or am home on the weekends/night. If you don’t like unfinished edges, buy cheap cotton scarves & do the same. Wash & reuse. Doing this has allowed me to purchase & use only one packet of sanitary napkins per year for the last 20 years.

Also, if you have plants & soak the pads before washing, the blood-water contains high levels of nitrogen & iron which roses & squashes absolutely love! My neighbor always asks me what I fertilize my roses with & I want to say “I bleed all over them!” hah



6. I also cut my own hair that saves me around $300 per year but that might not be for everyone.

1m9ist6,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1m9ist6/decluttered_my_home_in_a_week_big_good_feelings/,Decluttered my home in a week - big good feelings and things I learned,"I've been trying to 'get organized' forever. It never worked. I would do a little bit and then look at how much there was and how much crap was in my house and give up. Traditional advice never seemed to work for me because I couldn't imagine a better space, cleaning/tidying/decluttering were all mixed up and very stressful to think about, let alone do. Nothing I did made a dent.

Even small wins did nothing for me because there was so much more to do. Both of my parents had hoarding tendencies and I inherited a lot of stuff from my mom and from our old houses, and have my own issues with keeping way too many things.

But this week I was alone in my house, I had taken the week off, and I DID IT. Decluttered all the main spaces and my bedroom, rearranged furniture, cleaned so much, got rid of so much, and it's gone gone gone gone gone. 

And I booked a junk removal crew to come to my apartment and take all the stuff away. They came this morning. My home is... restful now. It's peaceful. I can breathe. I've never had that in 35+ years, not one time. It doesn't feel real yet. I'm excited to wake up to tomorrow.

There's... nothing on my floors. Nothing. Just furniture legs and happy cats chasing toys because there's actual clear space to run through. (Okay, there's like 3 things on my floors but you know what? I CAN SEE THEM! They don't blend into the other 50 things on the floor because there's nothing on the floor!!! What is this!)

I'm so happy. The best part is, my Dad lives with me and is coming back on Monday. He doesn't know I did any of this - he doesn't even know I took time off! -  and I get to surprise him. I'm super excited, he's going to be so shocked!

---

Things I Learned from doing this:

-Hire a junk removal service - I paid about $350 for this and I'd pay it twice over. It set a finite deadline, it put external pressure on me, and it made me keep going because **they were coming** so I had to be ready. This was absolutely essential, I don't drive and can't carry the furniture, and I had so many items for *years* that I didn't need or want but just couldn't see a way around. The company I chose donates as much as they can, so that helped a ton. I also got them to take away some items that were trash and difficult to handle myself.

-This is stressful AF. Self-care and positive self-talk was key. I had a 'staging area' for all the junk that was going, plus lists of what was going, and keeping THAT organized kept me mostly sane. Also, taking breaks. I realized yesterday I hadn't left the house yet and made myself go get a nice chill breakfast and a fancy coffee drink. And took regular breaks and stayed hydrated.

-Traditional advice sometimes works kinda? But only if I tweak it for me. Before I started on Monday, I made a giant list of tweaks and tricks and strategies for roadblocks that might come up. I relied heavily on this to get through it, and it was all customized to me and to things that I know have worked in the past, plus a few other things I wanted to try. I have AuDHD, anxiety, and OCD, plus some physical issues, so there were a LOT of tweaks to make sure things stayed interesting, fun, and didn't make me want to cry. At least not too much, lol.

-I don't have to do everything. I got 80% of the clutter out, and I got it out in all the areas that really matter. Looking around at my home now, I can *see* what still needs to be done... but it's okay. It's project-based now, instead of 'well I can't do A because areas X, Y, and Z need so much more work, even though A is way more fun'.

-I got as many daily things out of the way on Monday as I could. That meant I didn't struggle for clean clothes or dishes, had prepared food to eat, and also gave me a gentle bunch of familiar chores to offset with the scarier decluttering tasks.

-I also got some new pretty things - new office chair to replace the shitty one with shredded bonded leather, nice pretty baskets to hold my clothes, hooks to hang up coats and bags instead of plopping them on the dining room chairs, etc. They were like a little reward for doing this, and it helped make me feel more comfortable and happy.

2. **The AI Historian:** The ""Chronos"" engine is a master detective. It doesn't just see isolated data points; it sees the narrative. It correlates a credit card charge at a restaurant with your phone's GPS data, a photo you took, and the Uber ride you took to get there. It fuses these fragments into an undeniable, unified event on your timeline.
3. **The Interface (The ""Time-Stream""):** A beautifully simple, powerful search bar.Instantly, the system renders a dynamic report: ""At 2:15 PM, you arrived at 'Artisan Coffee' (confirmed by credit card & location data). At 3:05 PM, you took a 2.1-mile walk through Central Park (confirmed by Apple Health). At 4:30 PM, you emailed Jane Doe about 'Project Phoenix'...

# Why This is an Evergreen Behemoth

This concept scales from a crucial niche utility to a universal platform for human memory.

**1. The ""Digital Notary"" (The Immediate Market):**  
The first killer application is verifiable truth. Got a parking ticket you know is wrong? Facing a dispute over when a service was performed? The Chronos Protocol acts as your impartial, digital witness. This is a **Peace of Mind Subscription**. People will pay $5/month for the ""insurance"" of having a perfect, provable record of their life when they need it most.

**2. The ""Augmented Memory"" (The Mass-Market Vision):**  
Beyond defense, this becomes the ultimate tool for reminiscence and rediscovery. It's the antidote to our fading memories.

* ""Show me a map of every city I've ever visited, and the photos I took there.""
* ""What was the name of that restaurant I went to with my parents last year?""
* The AI can generate ""Memory Digests"" – ""This time five years ago, you were on a road trip through California. Here's your journey.""

**3. The Unassailable Competitive Moat:**  
This is the key. Once a user's ""Chronos"" timeline has been building for months or years, it becomes an irreplaceable asset. The service's value to the user **grows exponentially over time**. A competitor can't just appear and replicate a user's personal history. The switching costs are practically infinite.

**4. The Future is Verifiable:**

* **Legal & Insurance:** A ""Pro"" version could become certified for use in courtrooms and for insurance claims, creating a high-margin B2B vertical.
* **Personal Journaling 2.0:** Why write down what you did when your life can automatically log itself? This becomes the foundation for the richest journaling experience ever conceived.

# This is Not a Dystopia. It's Data Emancipation.

The fear of ""Big Brother"" comes from a lack of control. The Chronos Protocol is built on the opposite principle: **Radical User Control.**

* **A ""Kill Switch"" Dashboard:** The user can see every connected data source and revoke access with a single click.
* **Read-Only Mandate:** The protocol is a passive observer. It can never delete, post, or alter anything on your behalf.
* **Fort Knox Security:** End-to-end encryption and a zero-knowledge architecture are not features; they are the foundation.

We are leaving behind a digital legacy whether we like it or not. The only question is who gets to control the narrative. This is the idea that puts the user back in the driver's seat.

**TL;DR: An AI called ""The Chronos Protocol"" securely fuses your digital life (location, transactions, etc.) into a single, searchable timeline. It starts as ""alibi insurance"" and evolves into an ""augmented memory"" platform, creating a hyper-sticky subscription business that gives users true ownership over their digital past.**

What are your thoughts? Is this the ultimate life-logging tool or a step too far? Let's break it down.

1m9io39,https://i.redd.it/0dp9siaqw4ff1.png,This situation is unacceptable and disappointing,"Just got a brand new TCL NXTPAPER 11 PLUS. Was really excited to use this tablet exclusively for e-reading.

 I just wanted a large screen to read books in double column and my manga and graphic novel collection.

I left kindle because of Amazon's bs, so I didn't want the kindle scribe. 

I also don't want the kobo ellipsa either because I had one and returned it. 

I didn't want a regular tablet either because even with ""comfort lighting"" the screen just hurts my eyes. 

So finally, someone managed to crack the code with an android device and it doesn't cost so much money. 

This display is amazing and combined with the matte screen, it really does mimic an E-Ink device. The different modes are like magic. 

So, I took it to a coffee shop to read. It's on airplane mode and I get this fucking screen. 

Before you ask:

1. The app is up to date. 
2. The tablet software is up to date.
3. I have reinstalled the app itself, cleared cache and data three times.
4. Restarted the tablet multiple times.
5. Logged in and out of my account.
6. All books were downloaded from home wifi, so the content is in the tablet.
7. The Kobo app DOES work offline on my galaxy tab 7, google pixel 8, and my Kobo Forma. 
8. The KINDLE app (I don't buy from them anymore, but I still own a lot of books) works offline on all my devices.

Now I'm just frustrated. I emailed Kobo support, but nothing yet (they're probably closed at this hour). 

I am so bummed I couldn't enjoy thi product. Now I'm questioning the point of even buying this thing and also Rakutens android app. Makes no goddamn sense. 

Maybe it's the tablet's android build? I dunno. 

Anyone out there know something about this?

 So can I have a distraction to shift my mind to something else? I can offer immense goofy stupidity and plans on world domination. 

Now for the good stuff. I play on xbox and PlayStation. I enjoy singleplayer games but I do enjoy goofing off with friends in co-op games like helldivers. I'm always down to game but I will not play fortnite or CoD. As of I'm playing Cyberpunk. Destiny 2 too but not as much since the new expansion is a month out. And helldivers.

More good stuff. I love food and cooking. I'm what the kids call a fatass. I don't think I have a favorite thing to make but as for eating I do enjoy a nice bacon cheeseburger. I do make a mean bowl of fruity pebbles. And I have a tendency to make waffles with ice coffee. 


I wish I had the ability to focus on reading. I miss it but I blame phones for making my ability to concentrate not exist. But I do have books I want to read. 

It should be noted I'm pretty sarcastic and dry sense of humor. Has a 12 year old sense of humor. Also can't forgot my ability to say a random historical fact. 

I love music. Rock and metal. When I wanna get wild I whip out the Macarena or Barbie girl.  Pink Floyd is my all time favorite band. Dogs is my favorite song by them. If I had a time machine I would see them live. But I did see Brit Floyd years ago and that was awesome.   

As of right now I can go for a caramel ice coffee cause they're the best. I also do like pumpkin spice.

1m9ijke,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1m9ijke/separation_turning_sour/,Separation turning sour,"Context: have been separated but living together for maybe 2 months now, mutual separation due to not being in love/unable to meet each others needs (more on his end because I’m used to neglecting my own needs). He owns houses, leases car through his work, works full time and is main provider. We have a 1 yr old together. I haven’t worked properly or full time in 2 years due to birth trauma, health complications after birth, and I also have mental health things (got diagnosed ASD and adhd when I went to therapy for postpartum issues). 

In the last week our civil separation has turned really sour, he has been outwardly controlling, is wanting to claim my savings and tax return as his own and is accusing me of stealing from him and taking advantage of him because 1. I moved my savings (only my sporadic wage from attempts at going back to work or money that my family gave me) out of an account he had access to (not joint so he has no legal ownership). 2. He now retrospectively claims that I spent on the credit card outside our agreed upon boundaries (he’s referring to the odd coffee that wasn’t budgeted in but we did our finances every month and he never said anything previously about it and had been putting his own work lunches on the card. 

I have no access to his savings, the loan offset or anything, the credit card is in his name because that’s how we paid every expense and he had access to my savings because he wanted me to contribute financially. I work 10hr a week in my own business now as it’s all I can do with balancing full time motherhood (breastfeeding and co sleeping and he refuses to bath her and will shower with her if I ask and he works full time anyway) and my own health issues and lack of energy and stamina. He has now frozen the credit card and wants to pay it off by next week and said if I remain in the home he’ll move out but I’ll have to pay him to live in the home (it’s 4 bedrooms!!). 

I am exhausted, I believe because he stopped my access to the credit card that this now counts as financial abuse?

My family can support me but they don’t really want to take me in unless they really must, because my daughter will be with me and their house is really really not baby proof. 

He’s accusing me of financial abuse and saying that our mutual friends have seen our texts and I’m the one that comes across as the villain being cruel to him. My intuition says he’s projecting on me and gaslighting me somewhat but it’s really hard to know, I respect his perspective and disagree with it somewhat but I also don’t want to claim I’m a victim if it’s not true, I would rather know the truth than be right.

I apologised and took accountability for moving my savings out with out at least telling him first but my concern was that he was about to pay off the credit card with my savings without asking because that was our agreement before we separated, but now I’m starting to see how unfair it is, I have maybe $5K in savings and no assets and he has over $20K in savings alone, plus draw down on a loan, with $300K remaining to be paid off on a house now worth $515K and he has a stable job, and I get maybe  $600/wk from my business. This is all $AUD btw.

I don’t really know why I’m positing this but I’m hoping someone can help me feel less isolated and give more clarity

1m9ihjq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m9ihjq,Got tired of overpaying so I built a tool that finds better deals instantly when you shop online,"Hey everyone! Around a month ago, I built and launched a Chrome extension called [Peel](http://shopwithpeel.com/). It automatically compares prices and finds better deals instantly as you shop across sites like Amazon, Walmart, Target, eBay, Best Buy and more.

It dawned on me that most shoppers overpay because they don't check to see where a product is cheaper.

The idea is simple:

• It matches the product you’re viewing (using a bit of AI + product data to distinguish title inconsistencies)  
• Then checks if it’s cheaper on other sites  
• If it’s not the exact item, it suggests smarter alternatives that might save you more or options that would've been difficult to find otherwise manually

We’re a little over a month in, and here’s what we’ve changed from feedback so far:

• Added support for more stores  
• Rolled out a referral + cashback system but only after someone makes a purchase to avoid spammy behavior  
• Rebuilt the UI to make it cleaner, faster, and most importantly, non-intrusive unless a deal is found of value

And yes, of course Peel is 100% free to install and use. Any feedback is welcome!

I’m going crazy. I have a Timemore C3, it has served me well, but I think it’s time for an upgrade to really get more from some interesting coffees. I don’t care about espresso, I just want a really good filter grinder.

The thing is: I love clarity and fruit and acidity, but I also love sweetness and juicy brews. I don’t care about dark roasts, but medium roasts are still on my lane. I also don’t care THAT much for body if the brew still have flavor.

I’m afraid of getting a ZP6 and then finding myself limited and tired of tea like coffee all the time and finding out that some coffees are “hollow”. But I’m also afraid of buying a K-Ultra and not seeing much difference in separation and vibrancy and sweetness from my C3 to justify the price.

So, what I would like to know is if you guys think if it would be better to get a ZP6 for the light roasts and vibrancy-forward coffees and keep using my C3 for sweetness and body or to get a K-Ultra?

Is the K-Ultra a massive improvement over the C3 and still able to give me clear florals and vibrant acidity and separation, but just not as good as the ZP6?

Or there isn’t much difference between my current grinder and the K-Ultra when we are talking about sweetness, and I would be better covered by keeping the C3 and getting a ZP6 for maximized clarity?

I really can’t screw this up cause I don’t have that much money and getting these grinders in my country is a hassle.

This is not my real letter, but I don’t want any friends to recognise me.. 
I live in a family of 7, I have 4 brothers all older than me (except for 1 he is my twin), and 2 older sisters, this post is about the sister who is 3 years older than me.
She is the kind of sister who stood up and changed a lot of rules in the family, she is resilient, responsible, and logical, I am close to her but I’m not sure she views me the same way..
She has some bad habits, and Ive seen her make mistakes throughout the years, she has seen me make mistakes too, but i never saw her support the way I supported her, she always had a stronger relationship to her friends or haram relationships throughout the years (I have had some too and I admit I repented many times, I’m ashamed of this part of my past), she helped me and my twin with outings or doing things with her that my parents normally say no to, as long as it was something under her control, and it somehow benefits her or her wants, otherwise she rejects or if she isn’t included but still notified still rejects, I don’t blame her for this but i will mention an example, I ask her permission to go on a road-trip with my girlies, and to cover for me, but she denies, i ask her later if she would like to go on a road-trip with me, she denies, and then a week later goes on said road-trip with her friends, you see this pattern? This is throughout our whole relationship, she always says things like: “if it wasn’t for me, you twins wouldn’t have done this or that” “i wanted to give you the life i never had” “you can trust me with anything, i will always have your back”, 
I tested these things throughout the years, and when my twin and I got more freedom, (both got our driving licences, I came to the conclusion that we were always second options in her world, when she was our first, or at least, my first option because I viewed her as the closest person to me), but i felt that i pulled back even if Ive forgiven her for her mistakes with me..
In grade 12, I was in a haram online relationship and tried to end it and focus on my studies, said partner sent her a message and she came to question me and took my phone, (she took it for 8 months, changed all passwords on my social media accounts, deleted them, and went through my whole phone), at first i protested and tried to take my phone back, but my twin found out and they sided against me, my twin started pushing me around and was going to beat me up, and she just stood and watched, (the 3 of us were against beatings especially since we grew up in that sort of space), (my sister was also in a haram relationship then), i admit i messed up and she did that “to help”
But throughout those 8 months, she used to do things that made me question if she was trying to dehumanise me, she would strip search me because she had doubts i got another phone and was hiding it somewhere (I didn’t), and would always bust in any room i was studying in and start fights with me, we used to share a bedroom together and would kick me out when i wanted to sleep, and would annoy me when i was sleeping (between 11pm-8am), nonetheless I used to spend my time outside the bedroom to study in peace, my average that year before uni was terrible (but i was proud of it because i put my all in that year despite the misery she made me live)..
Fast forward to uni, we spoke many times and came to peace with whatever happened, i worked on bettering my relationship with her, and it got better, she got married this year to someone she loves, i am happy for her, and love her husband, but I have been through hell and back because i think he is worse than her, and he brings out the bad in her..
She got married in September, and got pregnant 2 months after the wedding, they were lovers before and my twin and i helped them get married because my dad rejected him the first time he asked for her hand in marriage.
My sister, her husband (who i will call L), my twin and i are really close, until these recent events happened…
1-[My sister got pregnant and both her and L asked me to accompany her to deliver her baby in another country, there wasn’t anyone else to go with her because everyone works, or has someone they have to take of, and my career had a rocky start, so I wasn’t working and was still applying for jobs, i had to put my plans and goals on pause 3-4 months before the travel trip because i will not be able to go into interviews and ask for them to wait for me till i travel and come back, so in total, i would be pausing my entire life for 7 months in total (before travelling and while being away), just to accommodate her, and L will be coming a few weeks before the birth date, and my parents a week before, to get to spend as much time with the newborn after she comes, no issue I love her and would do this for her.
Before we travelled, L had a friend who is seriously looking for a girl for marriage, and L suggested that we’d match well together, and they suggested we meet up me and potential partner (I’ll call him Z), Z and i met in my sisters house once for a meal, and second meeting was in a cafe with my sister and L, both meetings they left us for 10 mins to talk alone but Z only asked general questions (where u studied/ worked), no questions related to marriage, and my sister and L were planning for a 3rd meeting but it was hectic for me and Z as we both had our own things going on (his work and my last minute travel preparations), and my sister and I travelled.]
2-{L suggested for us 4, us 3 siblings and him to open a business in our home country and settled on a general idea of opening a laundry business, (the idea changed many times but that was the idea we settled on and would all be equal partners in this), once we travelled, L introduced my twin to Z casually, and suddenly L suggested for them 3 to open up a business plan together, and not a week after, L came to my sister and asked for a video call chat including me, my sister, my twin, and him, L found a coffee shop/ slush drinks/supermarket shop, and that its 15,000 and they spoke to the guy and reduced the price to 9,000, so we would all be partners where me and twin would pay 9,000 to buy the shop, and L and sister would pay 3,000 to cover the costs of items needed for drinks, etc), and that L and sister would give us back 1,000 (500 each to me and twin), to cover their part owed to us and then we’d split the profits 25% each between us 4, 
I asked L 3 times about this part because the math wasn’t mathing, and he went into a rabithole of calculations to lose my attention, in any case, i spoke privately to twin and said I wasn’t comfortable and i will back out, since they seem to be planning to profit off our backs (keep in mind me and twin don’t work yet, and sister and L both have been working for years, so twin and I would be taking our life savings), 
Anyways, twin and I backed out, not without weird things happening, next day after the call L was planning to buy the place and everything, and i told my sister I am not with them and I don’t want to proceed, (L calls my sister many times throughout the day to guilt trip, persuade, sweet talk my ear into the business idea so he can pay the guy), anyways i said no, and at that period, I spoke to my sister about Z, (almost for a month now), and told her i have a bad gut feeling and that I don’t want to get married or proceed with him so I don’t waste his time looking for a bride, my sister failed to tell L her husband, and L mentioned him the day of the coffee shop call, 
(I think L was inching Z into my life slowly and was including him in things that would bound us so he can get a wife AND a business, and kids (although my sister and L know I don’t plan on having kids tbh), sister came to talk to me after she spoke to L about me rejecting and was beautifying L’s image saying: “first thing he asked was, if his friend did anything to you to harm you”, he didn’t and i said so, and then realised my sister has been beautifying L’s image to everyone who comes across him or her..}
3-(Nonetheless, not 2 days after that whole situation, L is on a call with sister, and sister calls me in so he can speak to me, he asked me about my social media pages (I was working on getting it started since it could benefit my career and only have asked my sister to help, never spoke to him about it or ever asked for his advice), and he mentioned he has a friend who does something medical and has his own pages started and clients coming in, and that he can help me, then L started telling me what content ideas to post to get my following and said: “post a few videos of you speaking in medical terms/ conditions to seem like you know things”, and i walked out the room, sister followed me, and i said I don’t want to discuss further, and I don’t want his help, and i walked out the room to end convo with sis too, we fought about it next day and I exploded, She is pregnant but i have all this pent up anger for being used/ lied to/ exploited/ belittled, and so much more, sister and I made up, 
But now we have 3 weeks till L joins us in our 2 bedroom apartment, and 4 weeks till my parents & twin come, where they will be renting a 2 bedroom apartment in our building, sister and parents insist on me staying with her and L to help her after birth, and my twin and mum together to help my dad (he has nerve disease), i mentioned to my parents that i wear hijab and its not proper and i am not comfortable staying with L and sister, so parents suggested i stay with them for sleeping, twin and parents are supposed to be leaving on the 15/ September, and L on the 18/ September, sister has been keeping from me when I leave (since L booked hers and my flight here, and will be booking our flights back), 
I think she is hoping to make it seem accidental that I stayed with her till she is able to get the baby’s birth certificate and passport done, (in case the baby is late to her due date (28/August), although sister said her and L are booking flexible flights so they can change it anytime, and then telling me L would be able to take extra days to stay in case baby is late, and then said he wouldn’t be able to get extra days?) ).

I have been through hell and back with my sister and can’t cut her or L off completely, but she recently spoke to me about our issues throughout the years and that she feels i have taken steps back and that she would like to hold onto our relationship together, but how can i when i have spoken about our past issues and she keeps coming up with excuses, and when i deny that excuse or shoot it down she comes up with a new excuse, and when i shoot that down, a new excuse pops up? And I know for a fact that if i ever speak to her about all these recent issues, she will deny and make up excuses too? 
I am planning to cut off our friendly side, and stay official with her and L, what do I do? I don’t feel it is enough because i want to stand up for myself to avoid future exploitation..",0,1753498113.0,muslimgirlswithtaste,0,0.5,False

Not sure if this is the place to post this so if it’s not pls lmk where i can. I’ve never considered that bipolar could be something I experience bc when I was a teenager I was called bipolar repeatedly to gaslight me and I obviously resented that. My father was supposedly bipolar (also an addict and adhd) except I’m not sure that he’s actually my dad…lots of family drama but I figured it’d be worth mentioning that. I don’t know Jack diddly abt bipolar disorder even tho I’m a psychology and neuroscience nerd I think I’ve intentionally avoided learning abt it but idk. 

The reason I’m wondering now if maybe it’s worth considering is bc I’ve been up for like three maybe four or more days now with like max four hours of sleep and I’ve been more active than I have been like all year. I started this massive project of building a round pen for my horse out of nothing but sticks (dead hedge) and pouring a lot of time and energy into that even tho I’ve barely been sleeping or eating. Mostly just coffee and water. There have been times throughout these few days that I feel exhausted but never enough to sleep, I’ll rest my eyes for a bit and then get up and go do something else. I’m anxious as always but when I’m busy I’m not. I’ve watched probably 20+ YouTube videos in the last day or so even tho I usually watch maybe one a week.

 I’m also very argumentative and just generally have a shorter temper which is unlike me for the most part (though I do snap at ppl I apologize and it’s nothing crazy) but unlike usual I feel like I’m just like acting instinctively like I’m not rlly feeling the emotions I normally would?? Or they’re just not sticking around like they normally would. I’ll start an argument and then not even know what I was just arguing for or about and just move on like it didn’t happen which is very unlike me bc I normally hold grudges and need some kind of resolution or it feel like a lingering injustice. The most “sleep” I’ve gotten was resting my eyes after taking a bunch of doxylamine succinate. I’m a chronic insomniac so I haven’t thought much of it but like I should be tired by now lol. 

And now that I think about it there have been a few times in my life where I definitely wasn’t in like a normal state of mind but it wasn’t like anxiety like I always have. Like when I was 15 I remember I used to spend nights just awake all night making art (like the kind that is just a ton of repetitive tiny little things and super pesky and annoying but also others that were scribbles and I rlly enjoyed that style) and I’d laugh at things i shouldn’t, like my best friend told my mom she was worried abt me for laughing abt my dads death. I don’t rlly remember that but it sounds like me lol. I also would lay on the ground and pour a cold bottle of water on my face on carpet and everything. 

But rlly aside from that I think there’s only been a few other times that I noticeably was in a different kind of mood but it wasn’t like how I feel now. I wasn’t irritable I was happy and energetic and bold and I felt light. Anyways idk if this is even worth posting but yeah. I’m agoraphobic and I have some kind of ptsd and maybe ocd or adhd or something so I’m trying to work myself up to go to a psychiatrist so I’m just wondering if this is worth bringing up or not. Oh also I’m more jumpy than usual like if someone makes a loud noise. Oh and i feel very much like I want to do some kind of substance or something which isn’t super out of the ordinary but generally I don’t think abt it this much but yeah I’d kill for some fireball. And j think I’ve showered 10 times in the last two days which is normal for how filthy I’m getting outside but I generally avoid showering more than once a day. I’m like oddly talkative and being social (unlike myself) but the next minute I’m irritable asfk I don’t get it ",2,1753498059.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False
1m9id9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1m9id9c/sf_allie/,[SF] Allie,"Subject: New ai agent

Description: Gotta share this with you…

Tom,

I've been using an incredible AI agent. It's in beta and there are only a dozen users right now (invite-only). After a year, if I want to continue, I'm required to send a referral. 

So here I am. I wouldn't normally share this stuff (competitive advantage and all). But since we work in different industries, I figured you’d be the best person to tell.

When you publish content with AI, you know the drill. 

Hallucinations. 

No real originality. 

You have to patch it up, find expert opinions, and try to frankenstein that piece so it ranks on search engines and your audience actually likes it.

But this one is different. 

It generates your article, and literally does all the work you need. It emails experts for interviews, makes graphics, and publishes your piece on the web. Every step. Done.

It was too good to be true… until I saw the price tag. It's 4x what I paid for other products. But believe me... It's still less than a human and way more productive.

Anyway. Link below. If you subscribe to a package, I owe you a drink.

Darnell

* * *

Too good to be true? Probably. But I clicked the link anyway.  The website page says:

No-touch content
AI that plans, writes, edits, and publishes your articles without lifting a finger.
[Try an article for free]

I click the subscribe button, paste my brief into the form, and then hit submit.
The website, or the AI, tells me to check my email inbox in two hours. That's a long time. But, at the bottom, there's a disclaimer. It states that the agent doesn’t just produce content, but also reaches out to people, creates illustrations, and does other full-stack steps, typically with a 24-hour turnaround. 

That seems fair. 

It takes my team 3-4 weeks just to write and edit a piece for delivery.

The piece arrives a half hour early in my inbox. The email reads, ""Here it is!"" with a Google Doc link below. Signed, Allie. I guess the AI has a name. I opened the Doc, and the article is ‘How Joy.ly increased revenue by 29% in one year.’

I read the article. It's a case study on how the company increased its revenue, and it includes interview questions with the CEO. All original– Allie actually sent an interview form to the executive and received a response. In an hour and a half. How is that even possible?

I don't hesitate. 

The invite expires within 48 hours. I sign up and pay for the year (no monthly option is available). I open up my workflow for a client. It's a software company that helps teachers create and manage their lesson plans. I added the following 12 pieces to the queue. 

Now it’s been six days. I received several fleshed-out articles, and I have four new ones in the pipeline. I've never seen anything like it.

My content team? Starting layoffs now. Except one… she now works in a project management role, ensuring we organize the assets for the client after Allie produces them.

It isn’t long before I talk to my partners. There's a future with Allie. Bigger than us. I want the rainbow that leads to the pot at the end. The shovel for the gold rush. I want Allie.

I contact customer service to learn more, but the virtual assistant gives me AI filler email responses—go figure, you would think he would use Allie. Typical canned response. I looked up the LLC and found it registered somewhere in Charlotte. I booked the flight from West Palm Beach.

* * *

On the second floor of the tall office building, Allie.ai Corp. is at the end of the hall. I open the door and see an empty desk next to a single office door.

I knock, but no answer. I could hear the keyboard clinking behind the door. It stops. I keep knocking, but still no answer. 

On the empty desk beside me, a speaker pops up.

“This is Umberto, virtual assistant for Allie.ai. Can I help you?”

“Hey,” I answered, “I’m Tom. We emailed?”

After a brief pause, Umberto said, “Ah, yes. Can I help you?”

""Yeah, I'm here to see someone. Founder or someone. About investing.""

“Do you have an appointment?”

“No.”

“I’m sorry, the founder is busy right now. Come back another day,” Umberto paused, “but with an appointment.”

I returned to the hotel. I emailed Umberto. But no answer after a day. I emailed again. Two days later—nothing.

That’s it. I’ll go back there and force my way to the owner if needed.
I returned to the office and knocked on the door as loudly as I could. After a few seconds of keyboard strokes, it paused again. Then started back up.

The speaker gurgled. “Hello?”

“I want to speak to the founder,” I said.

“Do you have an appointment?” Umberto asked.

“No. You never answered me,” I said.

""You need an appointment—""

I ignored whatever else he said. I pounded on the door, over and over. But there was no response. Umberto got louder, and I even heard him say police, but I was committed.

I rattled the locked door knob until I twisted the cheap handle and I heard a strange crack. I opened the door.

It wasn’t an executive suite. It looked like an AI den.

As if it were a supercomputer, there were screens all over the four walls. Web pages, documents, and a dozen different AI chat tools. At the center was a desk with five different keyboards. Then I saw her— a human. No more than 20 years old with a headset.

I blurted the only thing that came to my mind. “Al—Allie?”

This wasn’t an AI agent.

This was a human operating behind a dozen AI tools, juggling a dozen or more clients and selling herself as an app. The room smelled like stale coffee. I opened my mouth, but said nothing.

Allie shrugged—eyes bouncing from three different screens. “I needed a job.”

•Weight Lifting: I’m a strong girl, my goal this year is to leg press 1,000lbs and maybe read up on power lifting. 

•Coffee/Beer/Wine: More so the experience of consuming these things. Trying new coffee shops on the weekend, beer and corn hole with friends on a Sunday afternoon, a wine bar and tapas for a change of pace in the evening.

I'm a mid-to-late 20s working professional (female) starting a new job in Kips Bay area by 1st ave after graduating from graduate school. I live in uptown manhattan now, but am looking to move closer to my job, aiming for <30-40 minute commute. I have a tighter budget having just graduated and am looking for a room under roughly $1500 a month, preferably off of the 4/6 line on the east side of manhattan like anywhere from the UES to LES, or in LIC, Astoria near the N/W, or Sunnyside. From having visited friends/family in Bushwick, I think I would prefer Queens>Brooklyn for my price range, as I prefer the vibe in Queens. I do like Williamsburg, but I know it's a bit out of my price range.

Because of this transitional time, I would love to sublet in one of these areas starting 9/1 for the mid-term (like 6 months) so I can get used to this new chapter in life, explore, and figure out where I would like to place more permanent roots. I would definitely be open to subleases greater than 6 months, I'm just not looking to actually sign a lease on an apartment come 9/1.

I should note that as a woman, I would prefer to live in a majority female apartment, although I would be super open to living in a mixed-gender apartment that is LGBTQ+ friendly and shares my same values of love, acceptance, and open-mindedness. I'm social, but not a partier, and instead love casual nights out, game nights, trivia, etc. and love walking/biking/reading in coffee shops/doing arts & crafts during the day. I don't have any pets but I love both cats and dogs so I would definitely be open to living with someone with pets.

If you have a room becoming available in your apartment, and you think we could be a good fit, please reach out! If you have any leads on where to look for mid-term leases that meet my criteria, I would also appreciate it. Any advice is helpful in this new process.

Thank you :)",1,1753497422.0,NYCapartments,0,1.0,False

**The Setup:**  
The KT Wiz (+220) and Samsung Lions (-130) clash in a low-scoring duel that’ll make you question if this is baseball or a chess match. The spread (-1.5/+1.5) is tighter than a pitcher’s grip on a slider, and the total runs line (8.5) is about as exciting as a rain delay.

**The Numbers:**

* **Moneyline:** Samsung is the chalk here, but at -130, it’s the financial equivalent of buying a $13 coffee for a $10 value. KT Wiz at +220? That’s the ""long shot who forgot to study for the test"" of the board.
* **Spread:** Samsung -1.5 (2.11) vs. KT +1.5 (1.69). If you’re betting the spread, you’re essentially predicting which team will fumble the most pop flies.
* **Total:** Over 8.5 (1.85) vs. Under 8.5 (1.98). With these odds, the under feels like the safer bet—unless you’ve bet on a moonshot home run from a player who

- Prefer modern serif or sans-serif typography, but open to ideas

I was one week away from my 1 year anniversary with my first serious WLW relationship and seemingly out of nowhere she breaks up with me, and I am devastated.

It was mature, and gentle, and the right choice in the end when thinking of long term. But right now in this moment I love so wholeheartedly. She is kind, thoughtful, creative, emotionally intelligent, and fucking hot to boot. We had so many adventures, slow languid mornings, coffee in bed, trips, dual crafting time, my family and friends loved her, and I loved hers. I wanted to marry her. 

But she felt that she was unable to be the partner and support I would need long term. And deep down I know it’s true. I would have loved to keep living in the liminal space we had created together. But the cracks of reality and the future I wanted and the future she needed were starting to show. 

It sucks to break up when we both still have love for each other, and no one is mad. It would be easier to be mad. Being heartbroken and sad are so much harder.

I'm looking for someone special who wants to chat with me, get to know me, and eventually share our days together.
I'm looking for a serious relationship, not a casual one.
I've been single for a long time, and I'd love to have someone to talk to about anything :'D

About me...
I'm a 32-year-old woman living in Mexico, Baja California. 
I'm 1.60m and weigh 90kg (I'm obese, so if you don't like big girls, I'm not for you).
I really like video games, watching anime, and drawing.
I love going out to eat and having coffee in new places!

Who I'm looking for...
A single man, between 30 and 42 years old. You can be of any height or weight, but I prefer white and asian men. 
You can be from anywhere in the world, but with the intention to visit each other eventually.
Note! I don't have a visa for the United States, and right now it seems impossible to get one.

Very important, I speak Spanish and English, but I'm not that fluent in English. I'd also like to learn Japanese; I hope to start classes next year.

If you'd like to chat with me, send me a chat 💖

I used to live like everyone else – 9 to 6, cold coffee, empty mornings, even emptier nights. I smiled in photos, but inside, I felt… numb. Like my body belonged to everyone but me.

Then one day, I just… stopped pretending.

I quit. No Plan B.
Moved to a country where I barely speak the language.
And I opened an OnlyFans account.

Now I’m building everything from scratch — on my own.
No agency, no team, no promises.
Just me, my camera… and a pair of eyes on the other side of the screen.

👀 I know what many of you are really looking for.
Not just skin. But that feeling — like you’re seeing something no one else ever will. A glance not meant for Instagram. A smile that appears not for the lens… but for you.

I’m still learning — myself, this platform, the people.
But one thing’s clear:
I don’t want to be just another girl on OnlyFans.
I want my subscribers to feel chosen.
Like they’ve stumbled on something real.
Like they’ve found me.

🖤
So if you’re here — give me a little guidance.
What makes you stay on a girl’s page?
What kind of content, energy, or vibe actually lingers with you after you log off?

(And what makes you scroll away instantly?)

Every comment means the world to me.
It’s scary putting myself out there like this — but honestly? It’s kind of thrilling too.
Feels like I’ve just opened a door…
And maybe you’ll be the first one to walk through it.

We are competed replacing the flooring in half of our small ranch home. The living room and dining area are one big open rectangle that will share a continuous floor from the garage entry to the bathroom at the end of the hall. 

I'm not sure exactly which direction to go as far as the shade of flooring, and the options for walls. The walls are all white right now, and I was thinking a neutral/ beige on the walls except for the TV wall. I'm thinking of an accent but not sure what color, maybe a dark gray or blue,  or something else? And in the dining area, there's the coffee barand cube storage, not sure what to do on the wall there either. 

The furniture will stay, though we will be looking into replacing the blue recliner with something that matches the couch better. 

All baseboards will be replaced with white trim, no quarter round. 

There's some pictures and renderings attached. Please give any and all advice! We used to rent a large century home so some of our things and layout may not exactly fit this small ranch.

Who: 16 and 17-year-old teenagers, boy and girl, and 2 parents - 1st time for everyone except mom

Flights: Southwest Houston to Oakland, 3 nights in San Fran - loved San Fran, loved breaking up the trip and getting on CA time. Win-Win! Oak Airport is much easier than SFO.  Southwest Oak to Maui was direct, so easy, even 30 minutes early.  Maui airport is tiny and very easy. Luggage was fast.  American Premium Economy, Maui to Dallas, on the way home. Premium economy was worth every penny.  I would definitely do that again for a long flight.

Wailea Elua Village condo 1204- rented a two-bedroom condo. It was perfect. Elua village is beautiful, everything is perfectly landscaped and so clean.  The best part was Ulua Beach. The best beach!  Perfect size, with sun and some shade spots, steps from the condo. Snorkeling is great all morning until around 1-2 pm. I saw turtles two days in a row right out front.  Loved walking next door to the Wailea Shops for lunch, coffee, dessert, and the small market was great for cooking at home and snacks.  LOVED the Wailea beach path - I walked the entire thing, around 3.2 miles every day.  We did not use the pool but others did. Plenty of parking spots.  Even had house cleaning twice during our trip.  The boys were in heaven at the Wailea Golf course across the street - not cheap but they said the course was fantastic.

South Maui Garden Food Trucks were our favorite - everyone could find something they liked, kids loved those huge burgers, which were a hit, I enjoyed Thai Me Up, my husband found a few other places, and we finished off with shaved ice for dessert.  Very easy to park.  We went a few times, for lunch and dinner.

Mama's Fish House - views and atmosphere were 10-10.  We liked it, but the it didn't blow us away. We often dine at upscale restaurants in Houston. Fish was very fresh and delicious.   Probably 1 and done for us.

Maui Spearfish Academy - boys loved it. Early morning, the guide was fantastic. Spearing fish is very difficult, but they learned a lot.

1 mistake - Road to Hana - teens didn't love it, husband hated all the car time, which I didn't anticipate, husband hated all the honking by the cars, yes, it was beautiful, but it was too long a day.  I loved the Pipiwai trail.  I think they liked it but they were so done by then that I think they were flying through it and not appreciating the bamboo or waterfalls.

1 other mistake - Monkeypod Wailea - maybe we hit a bad day, but the hostess was frazzled, service was terrible, and forgot an entrée.  Just a mess of a meal. NBA final game 6 was on and they refused to put in on the TV.   Unfortunately, nothing hit the mark.

We ate most meals near Wailea or Kihei and cooked many of our meals. I wanted to go north but we just didn't make it.  A lot of our time was spent at Ulua beach, walking the beach path, and watching the sunset from our condo balcony.  Things are spread out, so we just didn't want to be driving all the time. I had so many more places to go see, but we just didn't have time.

1m9hs9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1m9hs9g/she_has_them_all_fooled/,She has them all fooled,"Not sure if that's the best title for this rant, but I persist. I am currently 25 years old and still living with my narcissistic mother. At 17, I attended college but dropped out due to poor academic performance. I completely understand that it was my responsibility to ensure I maintained a good standing. Here's the thing, I did. By my second semester, I noticed my grades were slipping and took the initiative to try to see what was wrong. Physically, I was fine, so I sought help with my mental health. During that time, I was isolated and wasn't forming friendships the way my peers were, despite being a member of extracurricular clubs. I went to see a counselor on campus, and she referred me to a therapist not far from campus. The minute my parents found out, they incessantly tried to talk me out of it. My father went so far as to follow me to one of the sessions with my psychiatrist and lambast him, then afterwards telling me in the car that I had an uncle who was depressed but ""got over it by walking around."" My mother (the true narcissist in the pair) was worse after nearly every session; she would just say, ""These white folks just want money."" Eventually, my parent stopped paying for treatment, and my grades continued to plummet. Even though I was on the verge of suspension and was still allowed another semester to bring my grades up, my mother pulled me out, citing that she didn't want to pay for tuition that was going towards retaking classes and that it would be better for me to take the classes at a community college. I hated that idea, pleaded with her, but as you know, pleading with a narcissist goes nowhere. The summer before my first classes, I had a job at Old Navy, which I hated and left in October. Luckily, I had some money from that job that allowed me to drive my car to and from campus as well as buy food. During my first semester, though my car broke down and I wasn't able to repair it, and the money I saved ran out, which meant I was dependent on my mother. She would drop me off before her shift, so that I arrived at school at 8 AM and was picked up at 6 PM. During this time, I had no money to buy food at the cafeteria, so whatever she felt I deserved to eat, I did. This was usually whatever change (literal coins) she had lying around could get me. I should point out that my single mother is not a struggling woman; she makes over $100,000 and makes multiple trips to Europe almost every year. But if I dared to ask for $10 or to add an account where I can buy food on campus, she makes a circus, acting as if she is barely getting by. So for 10 hours a day, my only food sources were Sour Patch Kids, specifically Sour Patch Kids, because they were the only items in the vending machines I could afford. This, coupled with the general chaos that comes with living with a narcissist, again caused my grades to slip. Living with my father during the lockdown wasn't much better either. While I wouldn't go so far as to call him a narcissist, he is and was abusive; this included physical violence and grandstanding that left me unheard and experiencing a mental breakdown. After that, I needed a break and took a break from school, from which I haven't fully returned. I've gotten some remote jobs since then, and with those jobs, I've inched toward some autonomy, but I'll get back to that later. Back to food, this is something my mother has had a hate-hate relationship with. I suspect she may be suffering from orthorexia, which is unfortunately being encouraged by her peers who are also from an older generation where thin will always be in, and in their older years are facing high blood pressure, cholesterol, etc. Because of this, grocery shopping and cooking are done once in a blue moon. Typically, she will go grocery shopping once every three weeks, and despite spending money on wholesale memberships, she only gets the same few items (frozen vegetables, frozen fruit, water, keto bread, avocados, and some fish or shellfish). We're an ingredients house. It's not the worst selection for most people, but when you're forbidden from touching the freezer where the frozen vegetables and fish are stored, and anytime you do try to make something, you are berated for ""wasting gas and electricity,"" it's slim pickings. But again, at this time, I had my own money so I could buy a variety of groceries and cook the home-cooked meals I've been denied for so long, right? Wrong, when she saw the groceries I would buy she would hide them, threaten to throw them away informing me that ""there's nothing I could do about it,"" she would dig though the trash and take pictures of the food waste and receipts and share them with friends and family member claiming that she was ""collecting evidence of my food addiction"" (Quick aside: do you ever notice that controlling narcissist love to throw around the word ""addiction"" Jodi Hildebrandt used it, Doug Weiss, anyway). Now I'll share my food schedule at the time, but I know that you are only getting the information I decide to share, so I understand if you are skeptical: 

Wake up around 7 AM and try to eat something before work, I say try because my mom would be up at this time too and would yell at me for eating so early.

My first break: sometime in the mid-morning, but I wouldn't eat anything, I would just relax.

Lunch: I often would attempt to make something quick, like a sandwich, but once again, my mother would intentionally come downstairs, even though she was wfh at the time too, and it wasn't even her lunchtime, and interfere with whatever I was trying to do. So, if I needed the stove, she was at the stove. If I needed the sink, she was at the sink and on and on and on. Eventually, I decided it would be easier to order lunch or just nap.

Second break: I would make my second coffee of the day, or just drink a Celsius that would keep in my room.

Dinner: After work around 6 PM, I would order dinner WAY TOO much, since spending time out in the open kitchen would mean hearing her tantrums. 

To most, that's a pretty standard eating schedule; the nurses in the psych ward thought so. Yes, despite having my meal times dictated in a fashion that set strict times, and durations of eating, and ensured that I didn't overeat as to avoid getting too sleepy during working hours, my mother saw me as an absolute pig, and let me know many times. She eventually went to court and got an Emergency Medical Evaluation, claiming I was a binge eater hellbent on killing myself with food. Police officers would come to the house, put me in handcuffs, perp walk me to the back of a police car, and drive me to a local hospital for medical (most mental health) evaluations. She has done this three times so far; the first two were in the middle of the workday, and the most recent one was the day before Christmas Eve. She regularly put my job in jeopardy and made budgeting difficult since the items I saved up for and spent money on would be stolen and only given back after I paid her a certain amount of money. So that's where we are now, except I am currently unemployed, looking for a remote job that I can do without her knowledge while she commutes to the office. And dependent on her yet again, which means I'm starving ALL the time, and I'm approaching 26 and will not have insurance for when the anxiety and panic attacks send me to the ER ⏤ , something I am reminded of constantly by my mother 🙃. To anyone outside of her circle of friends, you might think, ""*Wow, that's awful. No one deserves to go through all that*."" But to her friends, I am ""*torturing her in her own home*."" ""*Bullying her in her own home*."" ""*Wicked*"" and ""*Hard-hearted*."" When it comes to the food issue, I shouldn't be complaining, ""*As big as you are*."" ""*No one would believe you're starving, you don't even need to eat anymore*."" Long story short, she's got them all fooled.",2,1753496226.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False

I’m on the lookout for someone who embodies fun, kindness, silliness, and loyalty—essentially, someone who’s just eager to chat. I know this is Reddit, and I might only make one or two meaningful connections from this post, but hey, why not aim high and see what unfolds?

A little about me:

- My favorite colors are pink, white, and black.
- I have a serious love for iced coffee.
- I enjoy bookshops, brunch outings, small get-togethers, being surrounded by gorgeous flowers, and listening to some great music.

When it comes to music, I'm quite passionate about it! My taste ranges from big bands to Taylor Swift (don’t worry, I’m not an obsessed Swiftie, but I do adore her albums Folklore and Evermore).

I would say I have a vibrant personality; I live in the moment and embrace my free spirit. Of course, I do tend to overthink from time to time—just a part of being human! I consider myself confident, thoughtful, and straightforward.

I vote blue, so please only message me if you are similar in that sense. Also, if you spend a lot of time playing video games, don’t message me.

I’m on the lookout for someone who embodies fun, kindness, silliness, and loyalty—essentially, someone who’s just eager to chat. I know this is Reddit, and I might only make one or two meaningful connections from this post, but hey, why not aim high and see what unfolds?

A little about me:

- My favorite colors are pink, white, and black.
- I have a serious love for iced coffee.
- I enjoy bookshops, brunch outings, small get-togethers, being surrounded by gorgeous flowers, and listening to some great music.

When it comes to music, I'm quite passionate about it! My taste ranges from big bands to Taylor Swift (don’t worry, I’m not an obsessed Swiftie, but I do adore her albums Folklore and Evermore).

I would say I have a vibrant personality; I live in the moment and embrace my free spirit. Of course, I do tend to overthink from time to time—just a part of being human! I consider myself confident, thoughtful, and straightforward.

I vote blue, so please only message me if you are similar in that sense. Also, if you spend a lot of time playing video games, don’t message me. 

I'm interested in chatting with individuals aged 25-46 who reside in the United States or Canada. Wishing everyone the best of luck in their search

# Best Banana Cream Soda 2025: Top Brands Reviewed

The quest for the perfect banana cream soda is a flavorful journey that many soda enthusiasts embark on. This delightful beverage combines the creamy sweetness of banana with the fizzy refreshment of soda, creating a unique and satisfying drink. As we head into 2025, several brands are vying for the title of ""Best Banana Cream Soda,"" each offering its own interpretation of this classic flavor. our thorough review will delve into the top contenders, examining their key features, core benefits, and overall appeal to help you make the best choice for your taste buds.

## Key Features Analysis

The best banana cream sodas differentiate themselves through a combination of high-quality ingredients,careful formulation,and attention to the overall drinking experience. Key factors include the authenticity of the banana flavor,the richness of the creaminess,the balance of sweetness and carbonation,and the use of real sugar versus artificial sweeteners.

**authentic banana Flavor**

The cornerstone of any great banana cream soda is, of course, the banana flavor itself. The best brands use either real banana puree or natural banana extracts to achieve a flavor that is both true to the fruit and avoids tasting artificial or overly chemical. The depth and complexity of the banana flavor is crucial; it should be more than just a simple, one-dimensional sweetness. A more nuanced banana flavor will have hints of floral notes and a subtle tanginess that mimics a ripe banana.

**Creamy Texture and Mouthfeel**

The ""cream"" component of banana cream soda also plays a vital role in the overall experience. Top-tier sodas achieve a creamy texture that is smooth and coating without being overly heavy or cloying. This can be accomplished through the use of lactose-free milk, cream, or combinations of other natural ingredients that mimic the texture of cream. The creaminess should complement the banana flavor, creating a harmonious balance that is both decadent and refreshing.

**Balanced Sweetness and Carbonation**

The sweetness and carbonation levels must be carefully balanced to prevent the soda from being either too sugary or too flat. Ideally, the sweetness should enhance the banana and cream flavors without overpowering them. Similarly, the carbonation should provide a lively fizz that cleanses the palate and adds to the overall drinking experience. The carbonation should be sufficient to create a satisfying tingle on the tongue without being so aggressive that it detracts from the flavors.

**Type of Sweetener used**

The choice of sweetener considerably impacts the flavor profile and overall quality of the banana cream soda. Brands that use real cane sugar or other natural sweeteners frequently enough tend to have a cleaner, more natural taste compared to those that rely on artificial sweeteners like high fructose corn syrup, aspartame, or sucralose. The type of sweetener also influences the body and mouthfeel of the soda; real sugar can contribute to a richer, more satisfying texture.**Ingredient Quality and Sourcing**

the quality of all ingredients, not just the sweetener, is critical for a superior-tasting banana cream soda. Brands that prioritize natural and high-quality ingredients, such as real vanilla extract and responsibly sourced bananas, tend to deliver a more authentic and nuanced flavor experience. Avoiding artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives is also a hallmark of premium banana cream sodas. Openness in ingredient sourcing and production processes further enhances the appeal of these brands to health-conscious consumers.

## Core Benefits

The appeal of banana cream soda extends beyond its unique flavor profile. The beverage offers several practical and emotional benefits that contribute to its popularity among both casual drinkers and dedicated enthusiasts.

**Nostalgic Comfort:** For many people, banana cream soda evokes feelings of nostalgia, reminding them of childhood memories and simpler times.This comforting association makes it a go-to beverage for moments when they seek a sense of warmth and familiarity. The sweet and creamy flavor profile can act as a form of emotional comfort food, providing a momentary escape from the stresses of daily life.

**Unique flavor Experience:** Banana cream soda offers a distinctive flavor combination that sets it apart from typical sodas and other beverages.The creamy banana flavor is not commonly found, which makes it stand out as a treat. This unique blend appeals to individuals who enjoy experimenting with flavors and appreciate something different from the ordinary.

**Refreshing Treat:** Despite its creamy and sweet elements, well-crafted banana cream soda can be surprisingly refreshing. The carbonation cuts through the creaminess, creating a balanced and invigorating drinking experience, especially when served chilled. This makes it an ideal choice as a thirst-quencher on a warm day or as a palate cleanser after a meal.

**Indulgent Yet Accessible:** Banana cream soda offers a sense of indulgence without being overly decadent or expensive. It's an affordable treat that can be enjoyed on any occasion, from casual get-togethers to solo moments of relaxation. This accessibility makes it a popular choice for consumers who want to treat themselves without breaking the bank.

## FAQs Section

**What are the key differences between banana cream soda brands?**

The primary differences lie in the ingredients used, especially the type of banana flavoring (real vs. artificial), the creamy component (dairy vs. non-dairy alternatives), and the sweetener (real sugar vs. artificial sweeteners). carbonation levels and overall flavor balance also vary significantly between brands.

**Are there any banana cream sodas suitable for vegans?**

Yes, several brands offer vegan-friendly banana cream sodas.These typically use plant-based alternatives such as coconut cream, cashew cream, or other non-dairy ingredients to achieve the creamy texture.Make sure you check the ingredient list to make sure that any potentially animal-derived ingredients are not used.

**How should banana cream soda be stored to maintain its quality?**

Like most sodas, banana cream soda should be stored in a cool, dark place to prevent it from losing its carbonation or flavor. Once opened, it's best to refrigerate any remaining soda and consume it within a day or two to maintain its fizz and freshness.

**Can banana cream soda be used in cocktails or mixed drinks?**
Absolutely! Banana cream soda can be a unique and flavorful addition to cocktails and mixed drinks.

High cholesterol and major depressive disorder, both well maintained.
 I take Vilazodone(40mg daily) and Rosuvastatin (40 mg daily).


Apologies in advance for all the detail that follows. It’s been a long and frustrating journey. Bloodwork has been completed regularly throughout the last 5 years and aside from cholesterol ratios (low HDL) and low-ish testosterone (300-ish) results haven’t shown anything interesting.


I have been experiencing constant headaches for the last 5+ years. Onset was gradual with no obvious cause. Pain is almost always a 3, sometimes up to a 6, and never less than a 2. They are accompanied by dizziness, light headedness, brain fog, difficulty finding words, difficulty concentrating, and very mild tinnitus. No sensitivity to sound, lights, smells, etc.. the only time my discomfort is slightly improved is when I’m laying down. I have had occasional episodes of vertigo lasting from a few seconds to a couple of days. 3 episodes in the last 5 years, never prior.


Around the time of onset I did have a pinched nerve in my neck. Again no obvious onset here - slept on it funny or something. The associated tingling in the arm went away with physical therapy.


I saw a neurologist for the pinched nerve and he ordered a brain & spine MRI. Results were unremarkable except for the mildly slipped disc/pinched nerve in my neck. I saw another neurologist who tried treating the headache with a variety of medications, including but not limited to topiramate, NSAID, Sumatriptan, CGRP, and Botox. None of them lead to any improvement in symptoms whatsoever.


The neurologist posed that the symptoms may be related to the 2 anti-depressants I was taking at the time (Effexor & Wellbutrin). I tapered off of them (with psych approval) and had no improvement over the course of 6 months. I ended up starting back up on a “newer” antidepressant after that as a result of significant worsening in depression symptoms. I was referred to a cardiologist to see if it may be POTS or something else cardiology related. Cardiac ultrasound was normal. Stress test showed vasovagal syncope but negative for POTS. Around this time my psych thought perhaps my symptoms were anxiety related. I enrolled in an outpatient anxiety support group and found that while I could somewhat relate to some of the symptoms, my anxiety is exceptionally mild (nervous in social situations, avoid confrontation, etc.).


After that the psych tried to address the difficulty with attention using adderall. Interestingly, this was the most effective medication I took to improve any symptoms, but I found the downsides of the meds to be hard to overcome (trouble sleeping, short tempter, etc.). Eventually I got my PCP to refer me to a major academic university. I saw approximately 5 different neurologists there with varying specialties and was referred to a headache clinic. The headache clinic had me reduce caffeine intake (3 cups of coffee -> 2 or less daily). No improvement. They referred me for a sleep study. Sleep study showed mild sleep apnea. Got a CPAP and wore it daily for over a year with zero improvement to symptoms.


The headache clinic also referred me to a specialist who was doing a study related to spontaneous CSF leaks. Physician had me take some self-assessments at home and eventually suggested I would be a candidate for more invasive imaging (CT myleogram with contrast injected in the spine) followed by an epidural blood patch.


Although the imaging was negative, the doctor suggested I would still have a ~30% chance of having a CSF leak that didn’t show up in imaging. He identified a few areas that looked “suspicious”. I ended up getting 4 different blood patches to attempt and fix the suspicious areas. Although I would have improvement in symptoms for a few days during recovery (I would lay flat), the improvement never lasted.


The academic medical center neurologist team also referred me to Otolarynogy for vestibular testing (VNG, vHIT, VEMP and rotary chair). Results showed very minor defects in vestibular function and I was referred for vestibular physical therapy. Completed ~6 months of rehab and didn’t notice any improvement of symptoms. BPPV and vestibular migraines were ruled out. There may be additional testing/treatment I’m forgetting at the moment.


I took a break from treatment and visits for the last ~6 months because I was honestly exhausted from all the appointments and lack of answers? But I’m ready to start up again and would like to find ways to either improve quality of life despite the symptoms (already doing CBT to address this), or actually get answers/ improve symptoms (daring to dream here).


I guess my question is…. Where the hell do I go from here? Is going back to the headache clinic at the academic medical center the right thing? Do I go back and see a neurologist again? Do I try and find some other resource?",1,1753495399.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

We've always gotten along generally. They have a son who's in university and he threw a pretty big party last night. They had warned us and let us know in advance and beforehand had given us a bottle of wine to thank us for our understanding. The party had its usual stuff, loud music, noise, etc. which I was expecting. 

However, the next morning, I got up at 7 and was sitting in my living room having a cup of coffee when I heard some noise coming from the backyard. I looked over to find a teenage boy in our yard, having a piss up against the bushes. I watched on as boy after boy came into the yard, all presumably to take a piss. Probably about 6 or 7 in total. 

I went out into the yard when they had left and found a few dozen glass bottles and cans littered around the yard. Most of them were near trees or flowers. I'm presuming that the previous night, people had come over to our yard when they needed somewhere private to relieve themselves. 

Our backyards are only separated by some bushes so I guess it may be difficult to tell between the yards in the dark. But in the morning they could surely have seen it was a different yard. And those bushes particularly stank of booze and urine. 

I don't know what to do. I've cleaned up my yard but should I mention this to the neighbours? How do I bring it up politely with them? Or should I? I think it was a 21st so they're unlikely to have another big party again. Should I just let it go? They've been really nice neighbours otherwise. ",9,1753494960.0,neighborsfromhell,3,1.0,False

I'm just kind of posting this as a last ditch effort because everything I google isn't helpful, and I don't have doctor's money so I can't exactly go if this isn't something I should be worried about.

If it helps rule anything out/in, I am pretty small. As in 5'3"" and average below 100 lbs at 18 years old. The heaviest I've been is maybe 107 lbs, and that was several years ago. I've tried gaining weight, but it's close to impossible. Before anyone asks, no, I'm not pregnant, and there's no viable way for me to be pregnant.

Over the years, I've had enough health problems to put an inbred pug to shame. I've had episodes where I pass out (usually attributed to heat or missing a meal, I've gotten a lot better at managing them) bad anxiety, and a digestive system that can't act normal for more than three days.

Maybe when I was about 14-16(?) freshman year, 2020, I began to wake up with uncontrollable shivering and a slight nausea. It would take thirty minutes or so, no matter if I got up and moved, that the shaking would stop. I'd be fine for the rest of the day. I've mostly counted these up to anxiety for school or because I wasn't in a good situation at home. (I still occasionally get these, but they're far more random or line up with gut health).

All of this is just a preface because, again, I don't know what could or couldn't help.

As of three days, my digestive health has seemingly plummeted. I've been waking up super early and having to talk myself down from puking. It's only gotten slightly worse each time. As I said, I'm no stranger to this, but for some reason, this has been concerning me. I can't exactly find anything specific I've eaten that would upset me, and no one else in my house is having to deal with this.

Last night I tried to just go to bed and hopefully sleep off my restless stomach, promptly woke up out of sleep at 6am (usually wake up around 7am or 8ish) and had to put a bucket next to my bed just because the nausea was remaining at a steady pace. Neither getting worse enough to actually vomit, nor going away. I was stuck on the toilet for most of the morning before it finally passed. I was left sluggish and with zero energy. Still managed to eat and all.

Now I went to eat supper tonight and got full super quick. As in, I already made a small bowl and could barely even finish half of it. Again, I decided to go to bed and sleep it off.

Not even forty minutes later. I essentially woke up out of a dead sleep. My body was on autopilot, and I just sat up bolt right. It was like I was begging my body not to throw up. The nausea was so bad that I was scared moving would trigger it. The worst part was the dizziness. I'm not sure how to explain it, but it felt like it was coming from two directions. Like my brain had sort of mirrored one side to the other. It was severely overwhelming. It lasted probably no longer than a minute, but it felt like five.

I checked my phone and realized I couldn't have been asleep for no more than an hour. I'm used to waking up maybe an hour earlier in the morning, but not an hour after I've fallen asleep. Promptly got my trusted bucket, went to the bathroom (no dark urine, so I don't believe it's dehydration), and then managed to lay back down. It wasn't long before I had to deal with trembling and constant yawning again. My body temp is hot, but I'm not sure if it's feverish, as I feel perfectly lucid. As of now, I feel fine.

Google simply says blood pressure, dehydration, or an ear infection. I do believe it could be related to blood pressure because we have suspected possible diabetes? I got my blood work done a few weeks ago, and I'm still waiting on the results. (Now adding that this could possibly be IBS-D.)

Most of the time, I see things like ""change your diet"" or ""stop drinking caffeine,"" and it hardly helps. I can't just change my diet on a whim because of financial reasons, and I have cut back on caffeine. Haven't had my usual cup of coffee in a few days to see if it'd help, but since I'm getting worse, I wouldn't consider it.

Does anyone know what this could possibly be? 

(I'll add edits in the coming days if anything changes or if I start feeling fine and freaked out over nothing.)

edit #1: managed to fall back asleep and woke up at five with uncontrollable trembling again and slight nausea. neck feels really warm, but everything else is fine.

edit #2: I've realized that eating a full meal causes nausea as well. Having to eat more in small doses.

edit #3 (today): about a day later since last edit, still can't eat full meals, and I'm staying pretty hydrated since we were in the sun all day today. got home and went to eat, got through a few fries and a chicken tender before my gut hurt. my system thoroughly cleaned itself for about forty minutes.

(Since this is a copied post, just be aware it's in present grammar but was actually about three or four days ago. I haven't had any severe nausea since. Just gut problems and trouble eating.)",1,1753494946.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

Sheriff Clayton Lock rubbed the sleep from his eyes as he stared at the blinking red light on his office phone. Four messages. All left before sunrise. That alone was enough to put a weight in his gut.

The dispatcher, Carla, leaned through the open doorway with a fresh cup of coffee. “Third one came in around five. Wilson’s boy found two goats torn up behind their barn. Said it looked like something out of a damn horror movie.”

Lock took the cup, nodded his thanks, and muttered, “That makes three this week.”

“Four,” Carla corrected. “Old man Rudd called after you left yesterday. Found his chicken coop busted open. Said he thought it was kids until he saw the chickens. Said there was almost no blood. It looked like the ground ‘drank it.’ Barely a drop of it anywhere.”

Lock sighed and dropped into his creaking chair. He’d been sheriff of Gray Haven for sixteen years. Long enough to know when something wasn’t right.

Coyotes were one thing. They came and went, usually after trash or livestock. But they didn’t do this. Not the way it was being described—ripped flesh, no blood, faces chewed off, entrails exposed like someone had performed a damn ritual.

He reached for the call log and jotted down addresses.

Wilson Farm, Red Branch Rd.

Sutton Place, Off Old hundred Rd.

Rudd Property, Pine Sink Trail And then, without writing it down, he added another in his head: Hensley’s Cabin.

Robert Hensley hadn’t called anything in—but Lock hadn’t expected him to. That old bastard would bury a body with his bare hands before picking up a phone. Still, the location fit. Out toward the ridges, right where the woods got thick. Something was working its way through the forest.

Lock stood, grabbed his hat, and slung on his duty belt around his waist. “I’ll head out. Might swing by Hensley’s on the way. Just to check.”

Carla raised an eyebrow. “Think he’s mixed up in this somehow?”

“No. But he knows the land better than anyone. If there’s something out there, he’s probably already seen it.”

Carla hesitated, then lowered her voice. “You think it’s a cat? Like a mountain lion? Or maybe a black bear? Coyotes again?”

Lock paused in the doorway. “I don’t know. But whatever it is… it ain’t hunting to eat.”

And outside the sheriff’s office, the day broke wide and quiet, like the woods were holding their breath.

Chapter 5

The morning came slow, blanketed in fog that clung to the hollows like breath on glass. Jessie zipped her jacket and loaded the last of her gear into the bed of the truck—trail cams, motion sensors, scent markers, and a notebook worn soft at the edges.

The tech wasn’t cutting-edge, not in ’94, but it worked well enough. The trail cams recorded onto VHS cartridges no longer than a deck of cards, with motion-triggered infrared flashes that could catch a raccoon mid-sprint. Most of her research at grad school had been built around this gear—primitive by future standards, but field-tested and sturdy.

Robert watched from the porch, a thermos in hand. “You sure you don’t want a guide?” Jessie smirked. “I’ll be fine, Dad. I’m trained for this.”

“Still,” he said, his voice gravelly with sleep, “the woods out here got more twists than you remember.”

She gave him a nod and a small smile before climbing into the truck.

The old logging road wound like a scar through the trees, and she followed it deep into the preserve, miles from the cabin.

Birds scattered from the treetops as the truck rumbled over rocks and mud. When the road finally narrowed too much, she parked beneath a grove of birches and set out on foot.

The forest here was older. Denser. The trees leaned over each other like conspirators. Jessie moved carefully, marking her route with bright orange ribbon. She stopped every few hundred yards to mount a trail cam, angling it toward well-worn game trails or watering spots.

Near a moss-choked creekbed, she found her first real sign. A print.

Large. Deep. Four toes—clawed. At first glance, it looked feline, but the size gave her pause. Too big for a bobcat. Too heavy for a mountain lion. And the stride was odd, like whatever made it had a lopsided stride. There was a second print nearby, but it was smeared—like it had dragged a foot or stumbled.

She crouched beside it, brushing away loose leaves. The mud beneath was torn like something heavy had kicked off suddenly. Jessie took a Polaroid and jotted down coordinates in her notebook.

A few yards farther, she found a tree trunk scratched high—higher than she could reach with her arm fully extended. The bark was torn in long, curved gouges. Not straight like a bear. Not the kind of sharpening marks a cat made either. Whatever it was, it was big. And possibly nearby.

The hairs on her arms prickled. She exhaled and reminded herself she was a scientist. The woods were full of mystery—old predators, strays, escaped exotics, even feral dogs could leave behind strange signs. But still… This felt different. Off.

By early afternoon, she had five cameras mounted and a mental map of the terrain. Before leaving, she placed a scent lure in a small clearing—a mix of urine and musky oil meant to draw out apex predators.

As she hiked back to the truck, wind stirred the canopy above. Something shifted behind the trees—quick, low to the ground. But when she turned, there was only stillness.

She stood there a moment longer, notebook clutched tight, breath caught in her throat.

The underbrush slowly settled, then out popped a small fox. It scurried off after noticing Jessie.

Chapter 6

The axe struck wood with a dull thunk, splitting the log clean. Robert bent to grab another, sweat already forming beneath his shirt despite the morning chill. Chopping firewood helped him think—or not think.

Lately, the line between the two was thin. He’d watched Jessie’s truck disappear down the ridge about an hour ago. She was more confident than he remembered. More like Kelly.

He set another log on the stump and raised the axe—when he heard the crunch of tires on gravel.

Robert let the axe drop and turned toward the sound. A dark green cruiser rolled into the clearing, sun flashing off the windshield. It parked beside Jessie’s truck tracks. A door opened with a squeak.

Sheriff Clayton Lock stepped out.

Same wide shoulders and squared jaw. The years had etched deep lines around his eyes, but Robert would’ve known him anywhere. He hadn’t changed much, not where it counted.

“Morning,” Lock said, voice tight.

Robert didn’t answer right away. Just wiped his hands on his jeans and stared.

“Something I can help you with?” he asked finally.

Lock took off his hat, held it against his chest for a second, then nodded toward the stump. “There have been a lot of strange reports lately. You saw something.”

Robert didn’t flinch. “And who told you that?”

Lock shrugged. “Nobody. Just connecting dots. Wilson’s goats. Rudd’s chickens. Sutton’s barn cats. All in a stretch across the edge of these woods.”

Robert studied him, jaw set. “I didn’t report anything.”

“That’s what Carla told me. Told her if Hensley found a damn body on his front porch, he’d just bury it and keep drinking.”

Robert cracked a humorless smile. “You’re not wrong about that.”

Lock stepped closer. “Look, I’m not here to argue. I just need to know what you saw.”

Robert sighed and picked up the axe again. “It was a deer. Torn up real bad. No blood. Gutted clean. Not the work of any animal I’ve seen.”

Lock squinted. “No blood?”

Robert nodded. “The body was dry. Like it’d been drained.”

Lock muttered a curse under his breath. “That’s what Rudd said. Like the ground drank it.”

A silence stretched between them.

Finally, Lock added, “You think it’s rabies again?”

That stopped Robert cold. His grip tightened on the axe handle.

“You want to talk about rabies?” he said, voice low.

Lock shifted his weight. “Robert—”

“No. You listen to me.” Robert turned to face him fully. “Sixteen years ago, I told you there was something wrong with those coyotes. I told you they were sick. Acting strange. And what’d you say?”

Lock’s jaw clenched. “That there wasn’t enough evidence to—”

“You said I was just spooked. Overreacting. That I needed to let you do your job.” Robert added.

The air between them crackled.

“She died two days later,” Robert said, voice like stone. “You remember that? You remember digging what was left of her out that den by Stillwater Run?”

Lock’s face hardened. “I remember.”

Robert looked away, the rage cooling into something heavier.

“I never blamed the animals,” he said quietly. “They were just doing what they do. But you? You were supposed to know better. She died because of you!”

Lock looked like he wanted to say something. Maybe an apology. But it stuck behind his teeth.

Finally, he said, “Whatever this is… it’s worse than last time. I’ve been in this job long enough to know when something’s wrong. I’ve learned from my mistakes, that’s why I’m here,” Lock said. “And Gray Haven feels… off. Like something old’s been stirred up.”

Robert didn’t respond. Just looked out toward the woods, where the trees whispered and the shadows ran deeper than they should’ve.

“You still know these woods better than anyone,” Lock said. “If you see anything—anything—you call me. No more burying things in the dirt.”

Robert nodded slowly. “If I see something worth talking about… you’ll know.”

Lock put his hat back on and walked to the cruiser.

As he drove away, Robert turned back to the woodpile, lifted the axe—and paused.

A smear of muddy tracks ran along the edge of the clearing. Large. Deep.

He stared at them a long time before setting the axe down.

1m9hchg,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1m9hchg/auroria_small_scene/,Auroria (small scene),"To preface, this takes place in 1950s America, which has won World War 2, but like really won, they fought the Axis and the Allies and established a new world order, with all their resources and scientific advancements, their technology is similar to what they had in the Korean War OTL but much more complex. In any case they test a bomb and it opens a rift into another world, Auroria. This other World has its own timeline and rise and fall of empires.

This particular scene occurs after America Defeats the Elven Empire and occupies their former puppet the Holy Elven Kingdom, due to the supernatural religious nature of the region and the massive bureaucratic machine that is the American Empire, a department is created to ensure that the region's supernatural products remain pure without allowing other American departments from interfering too much, this is a snapshot of  a checkpoint scene.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
The border checkpoint is a hectic mess of noise, as military police officers sort through a caravan of refugees and families attempting to pass through the Holy Elven Kingdom. They check paperwork and belongings.



The sun beats down on the checkpoint, reflecting off the golden dome buildings of the Holy Elven kingdom in stark contrast to the dirt road on the outskirts of the town.



Darius moves around the checkpoint with a small team of officers all adorned with the same patches and uniforms although Darius's hat is a different color from the rest of his peers, he steps past the checkpoint and pulls a paper out of his trench coat and shows the rest of the team behind him.



""We're going to split up here we're looking for elven soldiers trying to blend in,"" 



He motions at the paper, ""if they have any symbols that look like this, arrest them on the spot. If they're innocent, we'll figure it out later, better than letting a terrorist into the gates."" The group agrees, ""Grahms and Utter you guys take the groups on the left Josh and Enrique will take the right side I'll clear the middle. Questions?"" The group exchange looks with each other, ""alright, give em hell."" The groups fan out, and Darius folds the paper up and breathes a sigh of relief as the groups go off, he turns around himself with determination in his eyes. 



""I'm part of the HEC and im telling you to let them in."" Elara proclaimed to the military police member, he stuttered a little, 

""Ma'am they're specified reason to enter is different than what's on the work pas- "" 



""Did I ask? "" 



""I-"" 



""Go! Let them in!""



The military police member hesitates, and lets the family through, the father reaches out to her and grabs her hand.



""Thank you, thank you so much, you are truly blessed,"" he shakes her hand, the kids follow after the father, the mother of the group looks at Elara with kind eyes, and hugs her, crying tears of joy,



""I was worried, I was worried about my boys,""



""It's alright, it's alright now,"" Elara pats her on the back, she holds her, 



""Be safe and may the celestial sovereign be with you.""



She nods and walks off with her family. Elara shoots a stare at the guard, her green eyes piercing through his visor, she marches up to him her white and gold formal robe fluttering with the speed of her walk, the officer tries to create a distance between himself and her and is backed up into a corner, she looks up at him as he avoids eye contact.



""Don't question me again, you almost let a family go out there and die, you know that?""



""I'm sorry, won't happen again."" She stares at him, he keeps looking away, she breaks the gaze and storms off, he looks down taking a sigh of relief, he looks at her walk away and shakes his head, he then notices something and runs into the outpost.



""Ah, I see you're coming from Seraphia........Seraphia, he says Utter, ""



""Since when did they issue the elven army patch in Seraphia? Must be a new thing."" The two officers question a father of a family who is wearing an elven empire coat with a similar patch to the paper.



""You, don't understand, I found this, found it!"" Utter checks through his paperwork and looks at Grahams, he nods his head towards the rest of the family. Grahams goes towards the rest of the family,



""All of you, open your bags for me to see.""



He goes through all the bags, dumping things on the floor, he gets to one little girl with a small bag, 



""Open it,""



The mother interjects, ""please-""



Grahams shoots her a stare, ""I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing!"" The mother looks down,



""Hey! Stop him!"" The father begs Utter, who ignores him, paying attention to the paperwork,



""Are you deaf!? Open the bag,"" Grahams proceeds to berate the little girl, tears forming in her eyes.



The girl holds it tighter, Grahams reaches his hand out and grabs the bag, the father begins to move towards his daughter, and Utter grabs him by the coat. 



""Don't make it worse,"" Utter coldly states. 



The father clenches his fist, he grits his teeth, and as soon as he turns, he sees a magnificent wave of gold go past him, Utter no longer has his hand on the father's coat, and his face contorts in a sharp pain. He looks down and sees Elara looking up at him. She stands defiantly in front of the father.



""what are you doing?"" She demands an answer as she looks up at Utter who is now holding his hand to comfort the pain.



Utter stares at her, confused, ""My job, who the hell are you?""



""I'm Elara, I'm the compliance officer for this checkpoint. Where's your commanding officer?""



Utter looks around, searching, but then a scream comes from Graham's direction, he has the girl in handcuffs along with the mother, while a pile of glowing crystals lies strewn on the floor. ""Where'd you get this huh?"" He interrogates the daughter while the mother protests,



""STOP!""



Grahams looks up from his knelt position at Elara, ""what? Who are you?""



Elara, snaps back, 



""Im the compliance officer, have you animals not been told anything, do you just go terrorizing innocent people! Where's you're commanding officer!"" 



""Here."" A low voice announces. 



Elara a little shaken, looks behind her to see a towering figure, looking down at her. She stumbles over her words a little, before regaining her composure, she puts her finger in his chest, 



""Are you responsible for that? Do you think that's right, torturing the innocent!?""



Darius looks at Grahams ""Grahams?"" Darius asks in an inquisitive yet calm tone.



He shoots up to a position of attention, letting the little girl fall on her knees with the handcuffs on.""I found a stockpile of crystals in the girl's bag. I thought that these might've been stolen or inert fission crystals, sir""



Darius looks back down at Elara, maintaining eye contact, ""Seems sensical to me, what's the problem?"" He attempts to maintain this eye contact, but he's way too close to her. In a move, he crouches down to stay at eye level with her, he can't help but have a little smile, ""y-you are treating these people like animals! It's not right! This family needs those crystals to live it's all they have left,""



""Yeah? How do you know that?"" Darius questions, a smug look on his face.



""Let them through, im the compliance authority here.""



""Sure, i'm the AAAA authority here, you want to talk to my boss and we can get this sorted.""



The two were already close, but since Darius crouched down, they've been much closer. Elara refuses to back up and cave in to this clear intimidation tactic. Yet her heart is beating so much faster looking into his hazel nut eyes, her eyes study the stubble on his chin, the broadness of his shoulders obscured through the trench coat. She stands up straight.



""I'm ordering you to stop Your troop has made a mistake Mr.--""



""Lieutenant Kade--"" He stands up and sighs. He looks at Utter ""He didn't make a mistake, compliance officer----?"" 



""Compliance Officer Valen, address me by my full title"",



""right- compliance officer Valen, If you want to make sure these people make it through safe and unharmed, I suggest you follow us back to the processing point to sort this out, I can assure you I'll make sure that the AAAA's interest will be upheld. So Compliance Officer Valen, what do you want to do?""



Darius looks down at her, although his demeanor is cool and collected, every time he makes eye contact, his heart races, he keeps glancing at her lips, her slim figure and frame keeps injecting absurd thoughts into his head, he shakes them off.



A church dungeon turned into a HEC jail, golden hallways littered with cells in the walls, most full of impoverished families appearing to come from the crowd outside, the place is lit by candle light as the windows have been boarded up, a guard is sleeping at a desk his feet up on a desk, magazine on his face. 



Darius slams his hand onto the desk, and the guard wakes up and falls back out of his chair, he scuttles up back in his seat,



""what the hell were you doing!?""



""I-"" the guard stammers with his words as he races to fix his patrol cap on his head. 



""you know if one of these people get out we're all screwed? And you're over here sleeping? What do you think this is the nap time!? If you want to sleep I can help you get reassigned to the rebel suppression in Elven republic, you want that?""



""N-No sir,""



""I thought so, don't make a fool of me, stay up."" Darius takes a moment to collect himself, "" if you need a coffee tell me and I can get it arranged,""



""Thank yo-""



""Do not make a fool of me,""



""Yes sir,""



""right, we're inprocessing this family now move them up the queue.""

And outside the sheriff’s office, the day broke wide and quiet, like the woods were holding their breath.

Chapter 5

Robert nodded slowly. “If I see something worth talking about… you’ll know.”

Lock put his hat back on and walked to the cruiser.

As he drove away, Robert turned back to the woodpile, lifted the axe—and paused.

A smear of muddy tracks ran along the edge of the clearing. Large. Deep.

He stared at them a long time before setting the axe down.

Sheriff Clayton Lock rubbed the sleep from his eyes as he stared at the blinking red light on his office phone. Four messages. All left before sunrise. That alone was enough to put a weight in his gut.

The dispatcher, Carla, leaned through the open doorway with a fresh cup of coffee. “Third one came in around five. Wilson’s boy found two goats torn up behind their barn. Said it looked like something out of a damn horror movie.”

Lock took the cup, nodded his thanks, and muttered, “That makes three this week.”

“Four,” Carla corrected. “Old man Rudd called after you left yesterday. Found his chicken coop busted open. Said he thought it was kids until he saw the chickens. Said there was almost no blood. It looked like the ground ‘drank it.’ Barely a drop of it anywhere.”

Lock sighed and dropped into his creaking chair. He’d been sheriff of Gray Haven for sixteen years. Long enough to know when something wasn’t right.

Coyotes were one thing. They came and went, usually after trash or livestock. But they didn’t do this. Not the way it was being described—ripped flesh, no blood, faces chewed off, entrails exposed like someone had performed a damn ritual.

He reached for the call log and jotted down addresses.

Wilson Farm, Red Branch Rd.

Sutton Place, Off Old hundred Rd.

Rudd Property, Pine Sink Trail And then, without writing it down, he added another in his head: Hensley’s Cabin.

Robert Hensley hadn’t called anything in—but Lock hadn’t expected him to. That old bastard would bury a body with his bare hands before picking up a phone. Still, the location fit. Out toward the ridges, right where the woods got thick. Something was working its way through the forest.

Lock stood, grabbed his hat, and slung on his duty belt around his waist. “I’ll head out. Might swing by Hensley’s on the way. Just to check.”

Carla raised an eyebrow. “Think he’s mixed up in this somehow?”

“No. But he knows the land better than anyone. If there’s something out there, he’s probably already seen it.”

Carla hesitated, then lowered her voice. “You think it’s a cat? Like a mountain lion? Or maybe a black bear? Coyotes again?”

Lock paused in the doorway. “I don’t know. But whatever it is… it ain’t hunting to eat.”

And outside the sheriff’s office, the day broke wide and quiet, like the woods were holding their breath.

Chapter 5

The morning came slow, blanketed in fog that clung to the hollows like breath on glass. Jessie zipped her jacket and loaded the last of her gear into the bed of the truck—trail cams, motion sensors, scent markers, and a notebook worn soft at the edges.

The tech wasn’t cutting-edge, not in ’94, but it worked well enough. The trail cams recorded onto VHS cartridges no longer than a deck of cards, with motion-triggered infrared flashes that could catch a raccoon mid-sprint. Most of her research at grad school had been built around this gear—primitive by future standards, but field-tested and sturdy.

Robert watched from the porch, a thermos in hand. “You sure you don’t want a guide?” Jessie smirked. “I’ll be fine, Dad. I’m trained for this.”

“Still,” he said, his voice gravelly with sleep, “the woods out here got more twists than you remember.”

She gave him a nod and a small smile before climbing into the truck.

The old logging road wound like a scar through the trees, and she followed it deep into the preserve, miles from the cabin.

Birds scattered from the treetops as the truck rumbled over rocks and mud. When the road finally narrowed too much, she parked beneath a grove of birches and set out on foot.

The forest here was older. Denser. The trees leaned over each other like conspirators. Jessie moved carefully, marking her route with bright orange ribbon. She stopped every few hundred yards to mount a trail cam, angling it toward well-worn game trails or watering spots.

Near a moss-choked creekbed, she found her first real sign. A print.

Large. Deep. Four toes—clawed. At first glance, it looked feline, but the size gave her pause. Too big for a bobcat. Too heavy for a mountain lion. And the stride was odd, like whatever made it had a lopsided stride. There was a second print nearby, but it was smeared—like it had dragged a foot or stumbled.

She crouched beside it, brushing away loose leaves. The mud beneath was torn like something heavy had kicked off suddenly. Jessie took a Polaroid and jotted down coordinates in her notebook.

A few yards farther, she found a tree trunk scratched high—higher than she could reach with her arm fully extended. The bark was torn in long, curved gouges. Not straight like a bear. Not the kind of sharpening marks a cat made either. Whatever it was, it was big. And possibly nearby.

The hairs on her arms prickled. She exhaled and reminded herself she was a scientist. The woods were full of mystery—old predators, strays, escaped exotics, even feral dogs could leave behind strange signs. But still… This felt different. Off.

By early afternoon, she had five cameras mounted and a mental map of the terrain. Before leaving, she placed a scent lure in a small clearing—a mix of urine and musky oil meant to draw out apex predators.

As she hiked back to the truck, wind stirred the canopy above. Something shifted behind the trees—quick, low to the ground. But when she turned, there was only stillness.

She stood there a moment longer, notebook clutched tight, breath caught in her throat.

The underbrush slowly settled, then out popped a small fox. It scurried off after noticing Jessie.

Chapter 6

The axe struck wood with a dull thunk, splitting the log clean. Robert bent to grab another, sweat already forming beneath his shirt despite the morning chill. Chopping firewood helped him think—or not think.

Lately, the line between the two was thin. He’d watched Jessie’s truck disappear down the ridge about an hour ago. She was more confident than he remembered. More like Kelly.

He set another log on the stump and raised the axe—when he heard the crunch of tires on gravel.

Robert let the axe drop and turned toward the sound. A dark green cruiser rolled into the clearing, sun flashing off the windshield. It parked beside Jessie’s truck tracks. A door opened with a squeak.

Sheriff Clayton Lock stepped out.

Same wide shoulders and squared jaw. The years had etched deep lines around his eyes, but Robert would’ve known him anywhere. He hadn’t changed much, not where it counted.

“Morning,” Lock said, voice tight.

Robert didn’t answer right away. Just wiped his hands on his jeans and stared.

“Something I can help you with?” he asked finally.

Lock took off his hat, held it against his chest for a second, then nodded toward the stump. “There have been a lot of strange reports lately. You saw something.”

Robert didn’t flinch. “And who told you that?”

Lock shrugged. “Nobody. Just connecting dots. Wilson’s goats. Rudd’s chickens. Sutton’s barn cats. All in a stretch across the edge of these woods.”

Robert studied him, jaw set. “I didn’t report anything.”

“That’s what Carla told me. Told her if Hensley found a damn body on his front porch, he’d just bury it and keep drinking.”

Robert cracked a humorless smile. “You’re not wrong about that.”

Lock stepped closer. “Look, I’m not here to argue. I just need to know what you saw.”

Robert sighed and picked up the axe again. “It was a deer. Torn up real bad. No blood. Gutted clean. Not the work of any animal I’ve seen.”

Lock squinted. “No blood?”

Robert nodded. “The body was dry. Like it’d been drained.”

Lock muttered a curse under his breath. “That’s what Rudd said. Like the ground drank it.”

A silence stretched between them.

Finally, Lock added, “You think it’s rabies again?”

That stopped Robert cold. His grip tightened on the axe handle.

“You want to talk about rabies?” he said, voice low.

Lock shifted his weight. “Robert—”

“No. You listen to me.” Robert turned to face him fully. “Sixteen years ago, I told you there was something wrong with those coyotes. I told you they were sick. Acting strange. And what’d you say?”

Lock’s jaw clenched. “That there wasn’t enough evidence to—”

“You said I was just spooked. Overreacting. That I needed to let you do your job.” Robert added.

The air between them crackled.

“She died two days later,” Robert said, voice like stone. “You remember that? You remember digging what was left of her out that den by Stillwater Run?”

Lock’s face hardened. “I remember.”

Robert looked away, the rage cooling into something heavier.

“I never blamed the animals,” he said quietly. “They were just doing what they do. But you? You were supposed to know better. She died because of you!”

Lock looked like he wanted to say something. Maybe an apology. But it stuck behind his teeth.

Finally, he said, “Whatever this is… it’s worse than last time. I’ve been in this job long enough to know when something’s wrong. I’ve learned from my mistakes, that’s why I’m here,” Lock said. “And Gray Haven feels… off. Like something old’s been stirred up.”

Robert didn’t respond. Just looked out toward the woods, where the trees whispered and the shadows ran deeper than they should’ve.

“You still know these woods better than anyone,” Lock said. “If you see anything—anything—you call me. No more burying things in the dirt.”

Robert nodded slowly. “If I see something worth talking about… you’ll know.”

Lock put his hat back on and walked to the cruiser.

As he drove away, Robert turned back to the woodpile, lifted the axe—and paused.

A smear of muddy tracks ran along the edge of the clearing. Large. Deep.

He stared at them a long time before setting the axe down.

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal sweatshirt dress balances comfort, style, and functionality. Understanding the key features will help you assess which dress best suits your individual needs and preferences.

**Material Composition:** Understanding the fabric blend is crucial for both comfort and durability.

The best sweatshirt dresses typically utilize a blend of cotton and polyester. cotton provides softness and breathability, making it comfortable against the skin. Polyester adds durability, wrinkle resistance, and helps the dress maintain its shape after washing. Some dresses might incorporate a small percentage of spandex or elastane for added stretch and versatility. Higher quality materials will result in less pilling and fading over time. Look for a weight that is appropriate for the intended season - lighter weights for spring and summer, and heavier weights for fall and winter. Organic cotton options are also available for those seeking more sustainable choices.

**Available Sizes and Fit:** Accurate sizing and diverse fit options are essential for a flattering and comfortable experience.

A great sweatshirt dress should be available in a wide range of sizes, typically from XS to 3XL or beyond, to accommodate different body types. Pay close attention to the size chart provided by the manufacturer, as sizing can vary between brands. Consider the intended fit: oversized for relaxed loungewear, fitted for a more polished look, or A-line for a flattering silhouette. Features like adjustable drawstrings at the waist or hem can help customize the fit. Customer reviews often provide valuable insights into the accuracy of sizing and overall fit.

**Neckline Style and Design:** The neckline significantly impacts the overall aesthetic of the dress.

Common neckline styles for sweatshirt dresses include crew neck, hooded, V-neck, and boat neck. A crew neck offers a classic, casual look, while a hood adds a sporty and relaxed feel. V-necks can be more flattering for certain body types, elongating the neck and torso. A boat neck provides a sophisticated and elegant touch. Consider the neckline in relation to your personal style and the occasions you plan to wear the dress. Features like drawstrings on hoods, ribbing around the neckline, or decorative embellishments can further enhance the design.

**Sleeve Length and Style:** Different sleeve lengths offer varying levels of coverage and impact the versatility of the dress.

Sweatshirt dresses are available with various sleeve lengths, including long sleeves, three-quarter sleeves, short sleeves, and even sleeveless options. Long sleeves are ideal for cooler weather and provide a cozy, comfortable feel.Short sleeves offer a more casual, warm-weather-appropriate option. Three-quarter sleeves can be a stylish choice for transitioning between seasons. Sleeve styles can also vary, including set-in sleeves, raglan sleeves, and dolman sleeves. Raglan sleeves often provide a more relaxed fit and greater range of motion.

**Colour and Pattern Options:** A wide selection of colors and patterns expands the styling possibilities.

The best sweatshirt dresses come in a diverse range of colors, from classic neutrals like black, gray, and navy to bolder hues and trendy seasonal shades. Solid colors offer versatility and can be easily dressed up or down.  Patterned sweatshirt dresses,such as stripes,tie-dye,or graphic prints,can add a touch of personality and visual interest.Consider your existing wardrobe and personal style when choosing a color or pattern. Some dresses may feature contrasting details, such as colored drawstrings or ribbed cuffs, adding another layer of visual appeal.

**Care Instructions and Durability:** Easy care and long-lasting quality are vital considerations for any garment.Look for sweatshirt dresses that are easy to care for, preferably machine washable and able to maintain their shape and color after repeated washings. Check the care label for specific instructions. High-quality construction, including reinforced seams and durable materials, will contribute to the longevity of the dress. Avoid dresses with delicate embellishments or specialized cleaning requirements unless you are prepared to handle the extra care.

Sheriff Clayton Lock rubbed the sleep from his eyes as he stared at the blinking red light on his office phone. Four messages. All left before sunrise. That alone was enough to put a weight in his gut.

The dispatcher, Carla, leaned through the open doorway with a fresh cup of coffee. “Third one came in around five. Wilson’s boy found two goats torn up behind their barn. Said it looked like something out of a damn horror movie.”

Lock took the cup, nodded his thanks, and muttered, “That makes three this week.”

“Four,” Carla corrected. “Old man Rudd called after you left yesterday. Found his chicken coop busted open. Said he thought it was kids until he saw the chickens. Said there was almost no blood. It looked like the ground ‘drank it.’ Barely a drop of it anywhere.”

Lock sighed and dropped into his creaking chair. He’d been sheriff of Gray Haven for sixteen years. Long enough to know when something wasn’t right.

Coyotes were one thing. They came and went, usually after trash or livestock. But they didn’t do this. Not the way it was being described—ripped flesh, no blood, faces chewed off, entrails exposed like someone had performed a damn ritual.

He reached for the call log and jotted down addresses.

Wilson Farm, Red Branch Rd.

Sutton Place, Off Old hundred Rd.

Rudd Property, Pine Sink Trail And then, without writing it down, he added another in his head: Hensley’s Cabin.

Robert Hensley hadn’t called anything in—but Lock hadn’t expected him to. That old bastard would bury a body with his bare hands before picking up a phone. Still, the location fit. Out toward the ridges, right where the woods got thick. Something was working its way through the forest.

Lock stood, grabbed his hat, and slung on his duty belt around his waist. “I’ll head out. Might swing by Hensley’s on the way. Just to check.”

Carla raised an eyebrow. “Think he’s mixed up in this somehow?”

“No. But he knows the land better than anyone. If there’s something out there, he’s probably already seen it.”

Carla hesitated, then lowered her voice. “You think it’s a cat? Like a mountain lion? Or maybe a black bear? Coyotes again?”

Lock paused in the doorway. “I don’t know. But whatever it is… it ain’t hunting to eat.”

And outside the sheriff’s office, the day broke wide and quiet, like the woods were holding their breath.

Chapter 5

The morning came slow, blanketed in fog that clung to the hollows like breath on glass. Jessie zipped her jacket and loaded the last of her gear into the bed of the truck—trail cams, motion sensors, scent markers, and a notebook worn soft at the edges.

The tech wasn’t cutting-edge, not in ’94, but it worked well enough. The trail cams recorded onto VHS cartridges no longer than a deck of cards, with motion-triggered infrared flashes that could catch a raccoon mid-sprint. Most of her research at grad school had been built around this gear—primitive by future standards, but field-tested and sturdy.

Robert watched from the porch, a thermos in hand. “You sure you don’t want a guide?” Jessie smirked. “I’ll be fine, Dad. I’m trained for this.”

“Still,” he said, his voice gravelly with sleep, “the woods out here got more twists than you remember.”

She gave him a nod and a small smile before climbing into the truck.

The old logging road wound like a scar through the trees, and she followed it deep into the preserve, miles from the cabin.

Birds scattered from the treetops as the truck rumbled over rocks and mud. When the road finally narrowed too much, she parked beneath a grove of birches and set out on foot.

The forest here was older. Denser. The trees leaned over each other like conspirators. Jessie moved carefully, marking her route with bright orange ribbon. She stopped every few hundred yards to mount a trail cam, angling it toward well-worn game trails or watering spots.

Near a moss-choked creekbed, she found her first real sign. A print.

Large. Deep. Four toes—clawed. At first glance, it looked feline, but the size gave her pause. Too big for a bobcat. Too heavy for a mountain lion. And the stride was odd, like whatever made it had a lopsided stride. There was a second print nearby, but it was smeared—like it had dragged a foot or stumbled.

She crouched beside it, brushing away loose leaves. The mud beneath was torn like something heavy had kicked off suddenly. Jessie took a Polaroid and jotted down coordinates in her notebook.

A few yards farther, she found a tree trunk scratched high—higher than she could reach with her arm fully extended. The bark was torn in long, curved gouges. Not straight like a bear. Not the kind of sharpening marks a cat made either. Whatever it was, it was big. And possibly nearby.

The hairs on her arms prickled. She exhaled and reminded herself she was a scientist. The woods were full of mystery—old predators, strays, escaped exotics, even feral dogs could leave behind strange signs. But still… This felt different. Off.

By early afternoon, she had five cameras mounted and a mental map of the terrain. Before leaving, she placed a scent lure in a small clearing—a mix of urine and musky oil meant to draw out apex predators.

As she hiked back to the truck, wind stirred the canopy above. Something shifted behind the trees—quick, low to the ground. But when she turned, there was only stillness.

She stood there a moment longer, notebook clutched tight, breath caught in her throat.

The underbrush slowly settled, then out popped a small fox. It scurried off after noticing Jessie.

Chapter 6

The axe struck wood with a dull thunk, splitting the log clean. Robert bent to grab another, sweat already forming beneath his shirt despite the morning chill. Chopping firewood helped him think—or not think.

Lately, the line between the two was thin. He’d watched Jessie’s truck disappear down the ridge about an hour ago. She was more confident than he remembered. More like Kelly.

He set another log on the stump and raised the axe—when he heard the crunch of tires on gravel.

Robert let the axe drop and turned toward the sound. A dark green cruiser rolled into the clearing, sun flashing off the windshield. It parked beside Jessie’s truck tracks. A door opened with a squeak.

Sheriff Clayton Lock stepped out.

Same wide shoulders and squared jaw. The years had etched deep lines around his eyes, but Robert would’ve known him anywhere. He hadn’t changed much, not where it counted.

“Morning,” Lock said, voice tight.

Robert didn’t answer right away. Just wiped his hands on his jeans and stared.

“Something I can help you with?” he asked finally.

Lock took off his hat, held it against his chest for a second, then nodded toward the stump. “There have been a lot of strange reports lately. You saw something.”

Robert didn’t flinch. “And who told you that?”

Lock shrugged. “Nobody. Just connecting dots. Wilson’s goats. Rudd’s chickens. Sutton’s barn cats. All in a stretch across the edge of these woods.”

Robert studied him, jaw set. “I didn’t report anything.”

“That’s what Carla told me. Told her if Hensley found a damn body on his front porch, he’d just bury it and keep drinking.”

Robert cracked a humorless smile. “You’re not wrong about that.”

Lock stepped closer. “Look, I’m not here to argue. I just need to know what you saw.”

Robert sighed and picked up the axe again. “It was a deer. Torn up real bad. No blood. Gutted clean. Not the work of any animal I’ve seen.”

Lock squinted. “No blood?”

Robert nodded. “The body was dry. Like it’d been drained.”

Lock muttered a curse under his breath. “That’s what Rudd said. Like the ground drank it.”

A silence stretched between them.

Finally, Lock added, “You think it’s rabies again?”

That stopped Robert cold. His grip tightened on the axe handle.

“You want to talk about rabies?” he said, voice low.

Lock shifted his weight. “Robert—”

“No. You listen to me.” Robert turned to face him fully. “Sixteen years ago, I told you there was something wrong with those coyotes. I told you they were sick. Acting strange. And what’d you say?”

Lock’s jaw clenched. “That there wasn’t enough evidence to—”

“You said I was just spooked. Overreacting. That I needed to let you do your job.” Robert added.

The air between them crackled.

“She died two days later,” Robert said, voice like stone. “You remember that? You remember digging what was left of her out that den by Stillwater Run?”

Lock’s face hardened. “I remember.”

Robert looked away, the rage cooling into something heavier.

“I never blamed the animals,” he said quietly. “They were just doing what they do. But you? You were supposed to know better. She died because of you!”

Lock looked like he wanted to say something. Maybe an apology. But it stuck behind his teeth.

Finally, he said, “Whatever this is… it’s worse than last time. I’ve been in this job long enough to know when something’s wrong. I’ve learned from my mistakes, that’s why I’m here,” Lock said. “And Gray Haven feels… off. Like something old’s been stirred up.”

Robert didn’t respond. Just looked out toward the woods, where the trees whispered and the shadows ran deeper than they should’ve.

“You still know these woods better than anyone,” Lock said. “If you see anything—anything—you call me. No more burying things in the dirt.”

Robert nodded slowly. “If I see something worth talking about… you’ll know.”

Lock put his hat back on and walked to the cruiser.

As he drove away, Robert turned back to the woodpile, lifted the axe—and paused.

A smear of muddy tracks ran along the edge of the clearing. Large. Deep.

He stared at them a long time before setting the axe down.

1m9h6ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1m9h6ol/should_i_stay_or_finally_walk_away_im_emotionally/,Should I stay or finally walk away? I’m emotionally drained.,"Hi Reddit,
First time posting here, but I really need some outside perspective.

My boyfriend and I met at work about 3 years ago. At the time, we were both in relationships that were falling apart, his was a 10-year relationship with no communication, just habit. Mine was a long-distance relationship that had run its course. We developed feelings for each other, broke up with our partners, and started something new.
The connection felt amazing, we had so much in common. But things moved slowly. We only spent time together having coffee, going for walks, and sharing a few intimate moments. After 5 months, my birthday came. He messaged me sweetly in the morning and asked to see me that evening, but later canceled because it was rainy. I was really hurt. I waited for an apology. Nothing came. Eventually, we broke up.

Four months later, we reconnected at work. He apologized, told me he hadn’t been ready, and promised never to leave me like that again. I gave him another chance because I genuinely felt something different with him.
But then the same pattern returned:
• We mostly saw each other at work.
• On his birthday, I made him his favorite cake, and he asked me to just drop it off outside his building, didn’t invite me in.
• When I finally stayed over, he didn’t even have a pillow for me and woke me at 6am to go with him to walk his dog. He didn’t let me sleep.I went home, hurt.
• I asked if I could leave a pair of slippers at his place he said yes, then later asked me to take them because it “felt strange.” I cried and left.
• He said he’d change. And for a while, things did improve.

We eventually moved abroad together for work and a fresh start. At first, it felt like a dream. He started being more open, talking about our future, telling his family about me, fixing the things I’d once begged him to change. But I couldn’t shake everything from the past.
Then came the lies. Some big, some small. Every time I found one, I confronted him. He’d apologize, try to make things right, for a couple of days. Then, it was back to impatience. When I asked for reassurance, he said I was “ruining his day.” He started saying cruel things. I cried a lot. When I told him how hurt I was, he’d respond with, “Me too,” as if we were equally at fault.

I did everything. I paid for everything. Helped him find a job. Supported him emotionally. Loved him fully. I was his biggest fan.
And yet, even now, when I express that I’m still hurting, he finds a way to turn it around and make it about him. He tells me he’s sad because I’ve changed. But of course I have. I don’t feel safe emotionally. I’m tired. So, so tired.
When things are good, they’re amazing. I feel alive, seen, loved. But it’s always short-lived. And I don’t know what to do anymore. He says he wants to fix it, but his actions don’t match up for long.

Is this something worth fighting for? Or is it time to finally walk away?

1m9h69x,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypersonaldevelopment/comments/1m9h69x/how_to_have_genius_ideas_daily/,How to Have Genius Ideas Daily,"What if you could tap into your creative genius every single day? Contrary to popular belief, groundbreaking ideas aren’t just for ""gifted"" minds—they’re the result of specific habits and thinking patterns. Science shows that creativity can be cultivated, and with the right techniques, you can train your brain to generate brilliant ideas on demand.

The Science of Daily Genius

A 2021 MIT study (Dr. Rebecca Saxe) revealed that people who practice certain creativity exercises daily increase their innovative thinking by 72% within a month. Similarly, research from the University of California, Berkeley (2022) found that ""idea fluency"" (the ability to generate multiple solutions) is a skill that improves with practice.



Take Shinya Yamanaka, the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who revolutionized stem cell research. He credits his breakthrough to ""asking obvious questions others ignored.""



5 Habits to Unlock Daily Genius Ideas



1. The ""Morning Dump"" Exercise

A Stanford Creativity Project (2023) found that writing down 20 ideas every morning (even silly ones) trains your brain to think divergently.



\- Example: ""20 ways to reuse coffee grounds"" or ""20 future tech inventions.""

\- Why it works: Like a muscle, your idea-generating ability strengthens with use.



2. Cross-Pollinate Knowledge

The Eureka Theory (Dr. Kevin Dunbar, 2020) shows that 75% of breakthroughs happen when applying knowledge from one field to another.



\- Try this: Study something outside your expertise weekly.

\- Real-world example: Architect Bjarke Ingels designs buildings inspired by video games and ecosystems.



3. Embrace ""Contradiction Thinking""

A Harvard Business School study (2023) found that intentionally exploring opposites (""How could this fail spectacularly?"") sparks 3x more innovative solutions.



\- Exercise: ""How could we make this problem worse?"" then reverse-engineer solutions.



4. Cultivate ""Boredom Zones""

Neuroscientists at the University of Bath (2022) discovered that boredom increases creative insight by 40%.



\- Action: Schedule 30-minute ""no-screen"" walks or showers to let ideas surface.



5. Sleep on It (Literally)

The Nature Neuroscience Journal (2023) proved that REM sleep enhances problem-solving abilities by 58%.



\- Pro tip: Review challenges before bed to ""incubate"" solutions overnight.



Real-World Genius Generators

\- Sara Blakely (Spanx founder) keeps a ""failure journal"" to mine mistakes for ideas.

\- Elon Musk uses ""first principles thinking"" to break problems into atomic truths.



Your Genius Action Plan

1. Start small: Dedicate 10 minutes daily to idea generation.

2. Carry an ""idea catcher"": Voice memos or notes app for sudden insights.

3. Reward curiosity: Follow ""useless"" questions down rabbit holes.



As physicist Richard Feynman said: ""You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind."" The more you feed your mind intriguing questions, the more genius ideas will come.",1,1753494353.0,mypersonaldevelopment,0,1.0,False

It's trickier than just slapping a cool car ​on a shirt. I think a ⁢common ⁤pitfall ⁤is focusing solely on⁣ the *cars* themselves, and not ⁤the lifestyle.

I planned to go back to bed after taking care of her and got up to feed her then changed her. After this I realized I wasn’t that tired anymore and decided to go down stairs with the baby and game for a little while letting my girlfriend sleep in. My baby is 4 months old and she has gotten mad before but it feels like it’s controlling in a way regarding me gaming. Mind you my niece and nephew came to visit for 2 months over the summer and I have not been gaming at all during this time so I thought it would be okay to get a few hours on the game while she slept and I took care of the baby. So we went downstairs and I played with her for a little and then when she got fussy I swaddled her and laid her in my lap and she fell asleep while I gamed. At about 12:30 the baby woke up and I went upstairs to feed her and get her changed at which point I saw my girl was awake cleaning the small mess from me making dinner for us last night( a few plates and foil on some baking sheets) I said good morning and could tell immediately she was upset. She asked me to take the dogs out I already had when I got up but it was time again anyway so I did, so after doing that I made her some coffee and sat on the couch with her. She asked if she had been fed and I said I just came up to get her another bottle and then she asked when she had last been changed and I said when we woke up, again she’s been sleeping the last 3-4 hours and she blew up saying I was neglecting our daughter to play video games and that I need to pack up the console or she would give it away on Facebook marketplace. I didn’t want to argue so I just said okay fine whatever and went downstairs unplugged the system and tucked it away in the closet thinking it’s over. She treated me awful all day thereafter including silent treatment and being rude until we finally went to sleep. I slept downstairs cause she locked me out of the room when she went to bed. Then this morning I thought we were good and had moved passed it but she asked if I boxed up the console and sealed it with tape which I thought was ridiculous to which I said no but it’s unplugged and put away. She said okay that’s it you had your chance I told you to pack it away and you didn’t so I’m selling it today which started an argument and I told her no you’re not. She then said either I can make money on it or she would break it and I would be out entirely on it my choice and I responded and said do it and see what happens to our relationship. She said okay cool and proceeded to break EVERY CONSOLE I OWN. She started immediately slamming the switch 2 into the stairway banister then went downstairs and threw my switch original into the floor shattering it then unplugged the ps3, 4 and slammed them into the ground. The only one she didn’t was the ps5 because I refused to tell her where exactly it was. She then refused to let me leave until we talked about it which I didn’t want to because what is there to talk about and she refused to leave me alone finally she said she was leaving but trying to take my truck which is mine we are not married and I had this before I met her and she doesn’t have a vehicle ( she doesn’t work she’s a stay at home mom and any new vehicle is a financial decision for me to make and we’re not there yet). I wouldn’t let her and she said I have two options 1, to put my baby in the truck with her so she can leave or she would go destroy my truck. The entire time I’m trying to deescalate this but it’s not working and then she made the threat that her names not on the lease so any damage to the home I’d be responsible for. I finally got her to calm down and get out of the truck and chill out but this is where I’m at. I need to separate it don’t know where to start, can anyone who’s been through this provide any insight on how to handle this or go about things? ",27,1753494207.0,relationship_advice,87,0.71,False

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table.

At 300 pounds, I never dared dream of love.  
  
  
I thought a man like Harrison would never spare me a second glance in this lifetime.  
  
  
Yet he approached me first, making me his secret lover.  
  
  
On graduation day, he dropped to one knee and proposed.  
  
  
Three years into our marriage, desperate to conceive, I endured injection after injection of fertility drugs and choked down countless bitter herbal remedies. Finally, my wish came true.  
  
  
Clutching the pregnancy test results, my heart overflowing with joy, I rushed to share the wonderful news with him. But outside his office door, I heard piercing laughter.  
  
  
""Harrison, how the hell do you manage to sleep with that 300-pound whale?""  
  
  
Harrison's voice was low and cold. ""Every time, it's Julian who touches her. If Grandma hadn't been pushing so hard, I never would've married her.""  
  
  
Julian's voice dripped with disgust. ""That woman's such a slut. We always use protection, yet she still managed to get pregnant.""  
  
  
""She should look in the mirror and see what she looks like! Sleeping with her makes me sick!""  
  
  
""Find an excuse to get rid of the baby. Bro, your future heir has to be Lilith's child.""  
  
  
""Lilith, I'm forcing myself to sleep with a sow for you and my brother!""  
  
  
Laughter erupted from inside the room.  
  
  
At that moment, I finally understood—I was nothing but a joke to them.  
  
  
My whole body trembled as I wiped away my tears and left without looking back.  
  
  
Later, I heard they went crazy searching for me everywhere.  
  
  
\---  
  
  
""Holy shit! Breaking news!"" Harrison's friend burst into the living room, waving his phone and shouting.  
  
  
""Someone from my family's hospital just called—that 300-pound whale Stella is pregnant!""  
  
  
He slapped Harrison's shoulder dramatically. ""Bro, that's some serious heavy lifting!""  
  
  
Lilith's eyes immediately reddened, her voice trembling with wounded innocence. ""Harrison, you promised you'd wait for me forever, that you'd never marry or touch another woman...""  
  
  
Harrison rushed to her side, gently taking her hands. ""Lilith, let me explain. It's always Julian who touches her. If my family hadn't pressured me, how could I have married her? All these years, you're the only one in my heart.""  
  
  
Julian's face twisted with revulsion. ""Damn it, I always use protection. How did that pig still get pregnant? She's so loose she can't even tell us brothers apart!""  
  
  
He turned to Lilith with a fawning smile. ""Lilith, I'm forcing myself to deal with that sow for you!""  
  
  
""Bro, we need to handle this. The future Kingsley heir must be yours and Lilith's child.""  
  
  
I stood outside the door, my body shaking uncontrollably.  
  
  
So every night I'd shared a bed with wasn't my husband Harrison at all—it was his brother Julian!  
  
  
Just as I was about to leave, a servant suddenly appeared behind me. ""Young Madam, you're back!""  
  
  
The laughter in the living room stopped abruptly.  
  
  
I forced my trembling legs to carry me into the room.  
  
  
Harrison immediately put on his usual mask. ""You're back?""  
  
  
I'd once naively believed that Harrison Kingsley—New York's infamous playboy—had truly settled down for me. Now I realized I was nothing but a complete fool.  
  
  
Julian whistled playfully. ""Hey, sister-in-law, you're looking good today\~""  
  
  
My whole body shuddered, nausea churning in my stomach.  
  
  
So the man who'd been taking me every night wasn't my husband at all—it was this disgusting brother-in-law!  
  
  
How desperately I'd wanted a child all these years.  
  
  
To get pregnant, I'd swallowed countless bitter medicines and endured countless ovulation shots, torturing my 300-pound body until it was riddled with damage.  
  
  
Now I knew—Julian never wanted children. He'd even made his own brother defile me.  
  
  
""Mm."" I dug my nails into my palms, forcing out that single syllable.  
  
  
Lilith elegantly crossed her legs, her contemptuous gaze sweeping over my bloated figure as her red lips curved into a mocking smile.  
  
  
Harrison signaled the servant to bring over a bowl of steaming soup, his voice gentle. ""The kitchen made this sweet soup especially for you. You've been saying you're tired lately—drink this to nourish yourself.""  
  
  
I instinctively shrank back. ""I don't want—""  
  
  
""Be good."" He pressed the bowl into my hands without question. ""Drink all of it.""  
  
  
The warm liquid had barely touched my throat when the world started spinning.  
  
  
A tearing pain suddenly ripped through my abdomen. I stared in terror—this wasn't sweet soup at all. It was abortion medication!  
  
  
""The baby... the baby..."" I curled up on the floor in agony, tears streaming down my face.  
  
  
When I woke up again, the smell of disinfectant filled the air.  
  
  
Harrison held my hand, his face full of guilt. ""Stella, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were pregnant. That soup was just for blood circulation—it's all my fault...""  
  
  
I weakly turned my face away. He knew everything.  
  
  
Suddenly, his phone rang.  
  
  
Seeing the caller ID, his eyes clearly brightened.  
  
  
""Okay, I'll be right there."" He lowered his voice, responding tenderly.  
  
  
Without even glancing at me, he hastily released my hand and strode away.  
  
  
The moment he stepped out of the room, sharp pain struck again.  
  
  
I curled up in agony as the heart monitor shrieked its alarms.  
  
  
""Quick! The patient's hemorrhaging!""  
  
  
A team of doctors and nurses rushed in with emergency equipment.  
  
  
I lost consciousness once more.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
When I opened my eyes again, three days had passed. The room was eerily quiet—no one had visited me.  
  
  
With trembling hands, I unlocked my phone. The top trending story was photos of Harrison embracing Lilith at an auction, headlined: \*#NYC Billionaire Drops $100M on Antique to Win Beauty's Smile#\*  
  
  
The day I was discharged, I dragged my weak body home alone by taxi.  
  
  
As I reached the door, I heard intimate sounds from inside.  
  
  
Through the crack, I saw Lilith straddling Harrison's lap, their lips and tongues intertwined.  
  
  
I bit my lip and pushed the door open. They broke apart in panic.  
  
  
My gaze fell on the kiss marks on Harrison's shirt collar.  
  
  
Harrison casually adjusted his collar, his voice devoid of guilt. ""Today's the anniversary of Lilith's mother's death. She's very upset—her depression flared up. I was comforting her.""  
  
  
I said nothing, simply pulling out the divorce papers I'd prepared from my bag.  
  
  
""What the hell are you doing!"" Harrison suddenly exploded, slamming his hand on the coffee table. ""Lilith's emotionally unstable right now. Can't you be more understanding?""  
  
  
""Let's get divorced."" My voice was terrifyingly calm.  
  
  
Lilith suddenly clutched her head, collapsing into Harrison's arms. ""Oh, my head hurts so much.""  
  
  
Harrison immediately embraced her anxiously, grabbed the divorce papers with his other hand, scrawled his signature, then threw the pen violently on the floor.  
  
  
""There! Are you satisfied now?""  
  
  
I didn't answer, just quietly watched their retreating figures.  
  
  
My hands shook as I packed my belongings.  
  
  
That small urn—I finally placed it in my suitcase.  
  
  
Though it was empty inside. My child had dissolved into a pool of blood in that bowl of ""sweet soup.""  
  
  
Such a tiny box, yet it felt too heavy to lift.  
  
  
Deep in the night, I curled up in bed, tears flowing silently.  
  
  
This city was so vast, yet there was no place left for me.  
  
  
I cried until exhausted, then drifted into restless sleep.  
  
  
Suddenly, I jolted awake from a nightmare to find Harrison's hands around my throat.  
  
  
Lilith stood nearby, her eyes red with tears.  
  
  
""Tell me! Where did you hide Lilith's parents' belongings?"" Harrison's voice was ice-cold.  
  
  
I shook my head with difficulty. ""I... don't know...""  
  
  
""Forget it,"" Lilith wiped her tears. ""Maybe I remembered the wrong place.""  
  
  
Harrison grabbed the bag beside my bed. I lunged forward trying to retrieve it, but he shoved me away hard.  
  
  
The contents scattered across the floor. The urn hit the ground with a crash and shattered.  
  
  
At that moment, a pocket watch I'd never seen before fell from the bag and broke.  
  
  
Harrison's expression changed instantly.

Please read this, if not for my story then for the beautiful quote at the end that got me through all the bad times.","This subreddit has been such a huge help. I posted a lot here under two previous usernames and then of course this one as well. I cried and begged and pleaded my avoidant for a good 6 months. As the months went on, I had more and more periods where I got pissed and was OVER IT... only to flip back and want him back. But every time this happened, the times would get shorter. Instead of a week of being an emotional mess, it would be 3 days. Then 2. Then 1.

And now, finally, 8 months after the breakup, I'm at the point where I can redirect myself effectively. Not always easily, and I don't think I will ever be completely okay with what happened. But when I think about my DA ex nowadays, I experience a twinge of sadness and nostalgia that lasts maybe a couple hours at most. Then I'm able to redirect that energy to something else that is more beneficial to me - working out, school, playing with my cats.

My biggest advice is to let time do its thing. You cannot force your healing any more than you can force them to stop being avoidant. You will likely experience horrible moments where you fall back into despair and miss them terribly, even while recognizing that they were toxic for you. Just ride it out. It will pass.

A long time ago, I saved this comment from Reddit that helped me with another period of grief in my life. I want to share it with you in its entirety. Hopefully it helps you too.

Thank you r/AvoidantBreakUps. I wish you all the best.

""I'm old. What that means is that I've survived and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks.

I wish I could say you get used to people leaving. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies or leaves, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.

Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.”",3,1753493606.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,0.81,False

1m9gu0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/1m9gu0z/lost_places_memory/,Lost Places / Memory,"Hi friends,

I’m trying to locate a unique commercial building somewhere around Melbourne’s city loop, and I hope someone here might recognize it.

Before the pandemic, I visited this place and it left a deep impression on me — not just for its coffee, but for the overall atmosphere and design. Here’s what I remember:

The building’s exterior was a black glass curtain wall — flat and minimalistic, with no exterior pillars, awnings, or decorative features.
The entire structure had a cube-like shape — not a high-rise, but a small, boxy building with very clean lines.
The front entrance was located on the southwest corner, tucked to the side — small and low-profile, not grand or flashy at all.
Just outside the entrance, to the left, there was a small window for takeaway coffee orders.
The rear exit led into a quiet laneway with no outdoor seating.
The lobby itself was the coffee bar — not just a café on the side, but a true hybrid space, where the café counter blended seamlessly into the design of the lobby.
If you walked in the front, you’d see the restrooms to the right before reaching the back exit.
The interior walls and even the restroom doors were adorned with classic solid wood paneling or carved veneer.
The bathroom faucets were solid brass, giving the whole place a timeless, elegant charm.
It was quiet there — no trams passed by, and it felt like a little hidden sanctuary in the middle of the city.

Sadly, I didn’t take any photos at the time. But I often think back to it — not just as a coffee spot, but as a special memory I want to recover.

If any of this rings a bell, I’d be deeply grateful for your help.

“If you know this place, please let me know — I’m trying to find a piece of my memory.”

The building itself wasn’t large or showy — it had a clean, minimalistic cubic design with a flat black glass curtain wall. There were no external columns, awnings, or flashy signage. Both the main entrance and the rear exit (which led into a narrow laneway) were rather discreet, almost hidden. It gave off a sense of quiet elegance rather than corporate grandeur.

1m9gril,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1m9gril/told_me_he_needed_to_find_himself_again_after/,"Told me he needed to ""find himself again"" after getting out of a long term relationship a few weeks prior. Said he still had feelings and wanted to be with me. 3 weeks ago by, now he's in a relationship....","Okay, this one is very long and a lil confusing. So we need some backstory. 🙌🏻 Buckle up. 😭

I met him in highschool as a freshman (4 years ago). We became fast friends in October of freshman year. I developed a crush but didn't tell him. He got in a relationship and that lasted into the beginning of sophomore year. During that time, I'd admitted my feelings for him and his (then) girlfriend; I was exploring polyamory. He politely rejected me and life went on, no hard feelings and actually got closer as friends.

He broke up with that girlfriend and was single for a few weeks- two months AT MOST. (This is important later, he has a habit of jumping from relationship to relationship bc he's scared of being alone). 

Then, he got together with another girl. We'll call her Lexi bc why not 🤷🏻‍♀️. Lexi made him cut contact with me bc I was friends with her ex. So, him and I stopped hanging out. That was probably December of 2023 or so. Shortly after, (early the following February) I ended up leaving the school for medical reasons. We didn't talk at all.

Fast forward to last month, it's June 7th. We've both graduated highschool. He texts me out of the blue. I responded, thinking he had the wrong number, but nope, he was actually breaking no contact. We got to chatting and he said he'd broken up with Lexi the week prior. Which is why he was finally able to reach out, according to him.

We chatted for a lil while and that was that. Then he reached out again the following day. And again the next day. It just became a pattern. We'd text back and forth for hours everyday. It was pretty flirty. So, after a week, we went to meet at a coffee shop near our old school. We sat and talked for about two hours. Then, we got sick of sitting there, so we went to one of our old hangout spots. We were there for maybe an hour. Got kicked out by security for loitering lmao. Moved to another one of our old hangout spots and were there for a few hours.

It starts getting rainy and I don't really want the day to end, so we go back to his place (he still lives with his mama- don't hate, we're 18). So he lets her know and we take the bus to his. I'd never been there before so if was a lil awkward at first. But after an hour, we were right back to laughing. I watched him play COD while we talked (my idea, I love that game). Then a redditor in my PM's was trying to get us to fuck, calling themselves cupid. We got a lot of laughs out of that. But neither one of us objected to the idea?? 

Then everything slows down, it's probably around midnight when he turns off the game and the lights. We got the LEDs on, so many vibes, super comfy and chill. I'm laying on his bed and he's in his game chair next to the bed. We're talking and he admits he still has feelings for me. Lots of flirting and mutual nervous butterflies later, I head home. It was literally 4:30 in the morning when I left. We were together for 15 hours. 15 FUCKING HOURS! That was NOT the plan. It was supposed to be 3 hours max.... But I don't regret it, had a lot of fun.

That was Saturday, we continue to text back and forth all weekend. Then I end up going over to his place again Tuesday. I can't really remember who's idea it was. Seemed kinda mutual? Anyway, I get there around 4, we chill for an hour and then the play fighting ensued. I was playing keep away with some of his Legos bc it was fun. That's it, I had no other reason. Anyway, he played along, SOOOOO much fun, lots of laughs, some flirting and all that. We do that for almost an hour and a half then get tired. We eat dinner, courtesy of his mama (bless her! ❤️). He goes back to his game and is watching one of his old videos when he sees something that makes him sad. I call him over to the bed and hold him, comforting him and all that.

Shortly after, and I don't remember how we got here, but we started cuddling. It was 7pm around that time and we were falling in and out of sleep while cuddling. We woke up around 9am, still cuddling. End up sleeping through most of the day with fast and furious playing in the background- STILL CUDDLING, mind you. We literally spent 24 hours straight cuddling.... 

Spent some time on our phones for some space. 4 hours later, we were cuddling again. He kept kissing my forehead/hair, playing with my hair, etc. (I have some trauma with my head and hair so I don't really let ppl touch it unless I trust them- which he knew). That night, we watched Scooby Doo and I braided his hair. He's Native American, so his hair is down to his low back. It holds a lot of spiritual and cultural meaning to him. He doesn't let ppl touch it. So it was a big sign of trust. I used to braid it in school too. Apparently, from what he told me, until me, he hadn't let anyone touch his hair since middle school. INCLUDING HIS EXES! Which he was in long-term relationships with both... (One was a year and the other was almost 2 and a half years). So that was really intimate.

I gave him a massage and started kissing on his neck or whatever. That all lasted an hour, hour and a half. More play fighting, he was kissing on my neck for a minute but that's all that happened. Had some serious conversations about what we were doing, our goals, what we wanted and if we wanted a relationship. We mutually agreed that we wanted a relationship but not yet. Especially since we'd just gotten back in touch a few weeks prior and he'd just gotten out of a long-term relationship.

After that, we cuddled into the next day. I left around 4pm. That was Thursday, I got there on Tuesday. A heatwave started so I bought him a fan cuz his place doesn't have AC and I didn't want him to boil lol.

The following Monday, I message him saying I'd had so much fun, but I'd still be talking to other people until we made it official. To which he responded that he'd talked to his friends and decided he needed to take some time and space to heal and just be single. To ""find himself again"". I respected the boundary. After all, that's a smart, responsible, adult decision to make. I was a lil bummed but he reassured me it wasn't anything I did. He said he still had feelings and wanted to be with me in the future. He wanted to know if I was okay still being friends. I said I needed time to think and get back to him.

Anyway, a few weeks go by, I get busy and get a job (yay, me! 🥳). Overall, just get soooo busy. I completely forget about it. Then yesterday I was like ""oh shit, I still haven't gotten back to him. Lemme do that real quick"". So I message him and say this: 

""Hey! I'm so sorry, I swear I haven't been avoiding you intentionally. Life has just been superrrrrr hectic lately. Just wanted to let you know that we're cool on my end. No hurt or anything negative. If you wanna be friends, that's chill with me. I'm working now, so I'll probably be less responsive, but I'm cool with us chatting 🤷🏻‍♀️""

And he responds with:

""No worries, I just wanted to say that I am in a relationship, and that if you're still ok with chatting then I'd be ok with it, and that it hasn't been for long, started about a week ago""

Like... WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK!?!!?!? I was shocked. Angry, confused, hurt. All the things. So I texted him back asking what happened to being single and asked if he got back with his ex, Lexi. To which he responded:

""I wasn't expecting to be and no I'm not back with  Lexi""

That's all I get. That's all he says. I know he doesn't owe me anything, but goddamn it, what the hell?! You're gonna drop a bomb like that and not give me more details? Sooo shitty. I said I was low-key mad but he can do him. I called my mama for some support and after that conversation, I call him, hoping for some answers. Of course, he doesn't pick up. Now, I know ppl have their own lives and are busy. But how are you going to say something like that after everything that happened and then not pick up?? 

I left him a voicemail. I was basically asking him for answers and expressing my frustration and hurt- in a very polite way, mind you.

He still hasn't responded in any way. I haven't messaged him again cuz I'm kinda over his bullshit. And I'm not gonna be the girl who gives him the satisfaction of chasing him. I'm not doing that. So, yeah. That was Wednesday. I'm angry, sad, hurt, numb and tired. I cried my tears when I found out. Not wasting any more energy on that damn boy. Might block him, but I haven't decided yet. I'll probably try to see if he ever responds first (without me being the one to reach out). If for nothing else other than answers. But being friends is definitely off the table for me now. 

Feel free to relate in the comments, offer advice, opinions, literally anything. Don't PM me. If you have something to say, comment it. I'm not answering PM's.

Stay safe out there, lovelies! 😘 It's rough here, but we keep it pushing! 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻

TL;DR: he reconnected with me after years of silence. Spent 2/3 weeks low-key talking. Then he pumped the brakes, said he needed to figure himself out after getting out of a long-term relationship.

It was well past midnight when I saw him. I was driving my rig down I-5, the California freeway stretching out like a black ribbon under a starless sky. The hum of my engine was the only sound, aside from the occasional static from the CB radio. I was tired—my eyes heavy from the long hours on the road—but I had a delivery to make by morning, so I pushed on.

I thought about my wife, Lisa, and our two kids, Tommy and Emma. I missed them terribly. It had been three weeks since I last saw them, and I was counting down the days until I could go home. But for now, I had to focus on the road. The smell of diesel and old coffee filled the cab, and my hands gripped the worn steering wheel, steadying me against the monotony.

The highway was deserted, which wasn’t unusual for this time of night. Just me and the darkness, with my headlights cutting through the void. I passed a few other trucks, their lights like distant beacons, but otherwise, it was just me. The quiet was oppressive, broken only by the steady rumble of my engine and the faint hum of the radio.

I was about 20 miles north of Bakersfield when I first noticed something odd. There was a car pulled over on the shoulder, its hazard lights flashing. As I approached, I slowed down a bit, curious. But when I got closer, I saw that there was no one inside. The doors were closed, and it looked abandoned.

That’s strange, I thought. Maybe they ran out of gas or something. But why leave the hazards on if no one’s there?

I shook my head and continued driving. Probably nothing—just someone who got a ride or something. But it left me uneasy, like a small itch in the back of my mind. The road felt emptier now, the darkness pressing in a little closer.

A few miles later, my CB radio crackled to life. “Breaker 1-9, anyone out there? I need help.”

I grabbed my microphone, my pulse quickening. “This is Big Rig Bill. What’s your 20?”

There was static, then silence. “Hello? Anyone there?” I tried again.

No response. Maybe it was just a kid messing around, or maybe the signal was bad. But it added to the growing sense of unease. The empty car, the mysterious call—it was all a bit off. I put the microphone down and kept driving, my hands gripping the wheel a little tighter. The road stretched on, endless and dark. I turned up the radio, hoping for some music to distract me, but all I got was static. Great, just great.

Then, suddenly, in my headlights, I saw him. A man, kneeling in the middle of my lane, his arms outstretched as if he was crucified, facing me directly.

My heart jumped into my throat. I slammed on the brakes, the tires screeching as I swerved to the left lane. The truck lurched, and I felt the weight shift as I barely avoided him. For a split second, I thought I was going to hit him. My breath caught in my chest as I fought to keep control of the rig.

I looked in my side mirror and saw him still there, unmoving, like a statue in the middle of the highway. His arms were still outstretched, his head bowed slightly. He didn’t flinch, didn’t move. It was as if he was waiting for something—or someone.

What was he doing? Was he trying to get himself killed? Or was this some kind of protest? My mind raced with possibilities, none of them good. My hands were shaking, and sweat beaded on my forehead despite the cool air in the cab.

I slowed down, pulling over to the shoulder, my breath coming in short gasps. I grabbed my phone and dialed 911.

“911, what’s your emergency?” the operator answered, her voice calm and professional.

“I just almost hit a man on I-5,” I said, my voice trembling. “He’s kneeling in the middle of the lane, arms out like… like he’s on a cross.”

“Can you tell me your exact location?” she asked.

I looked around, trying to see the mile markers, but in the darkness, it was hard to tell. “I’m not sure. I think I’m about 20 miles north of Bakersfield.”

“Alright, I’ll send someone out. Please stay on the line,” she said.

But I couldn’t just sit there. I needed to know if he was okay—or if he was still there. I put the phone down and carefully pulled back onto the highway, driving slowly in the left lane, keeping an eye on the right.

As I approached where I thought he was, I saw nothing. The road was empty. No man, no car, nothing. Just the dark asphalt stretching out ahead.

I slowed down even more, scanning both sides of the road, but there was no sign of him. It was as if he had vanished into thin air. My pulse pounded in my ears, and I wondered if I’d imagined it. Was I that tired? Had I been driving too long?

“Hello? Are you still there?” the operator’s voice came from my phone.

“Uh, yeah, I’m here,” I said, my voice unsteady. “But he’s gone. I don’t see him anymore.”

“Perhaps he moved off the road,” she replied. “We’ll still send someone to check.”

I thanked her and hung up, feeling a mix of relief and unease. What had just happened? Why was that man there, and where did he go? I checked my mirrors again, half-expecting to see him standing behind my truck, but there was nothing.

I continued driving, but I couldn’t shake the image from my mind. His pose was so deliberate, so eerie. It reminded me of stories I’d heard from other truckers—people standing in the road, trying to get hit. Some said it was for insurance scams, others thought it was suicide attempts. I’d always thought those stories were exaggerated, the kind of thing drivers tell to pass the time. But now, I wasn’t so sure.

I thought about the people I’d read about in the news, folks who stepped onto highways in moments of despair. It made my chest ache to think about it. Was that man one of them? Or was it something else entirely, something I couldn’t wrap my head around?

I drove for another hour, my mind racing, until I reached a truck stop near Fresno. I parked my rig and went inside to grab a coffee. My hands were still shaking, and I needed something to calm my nerves. The fluorescent lights of the diner felt harsh after the darkness of the road, and the smell of fried food and stale coffee was almost comforting.

Inside, I saw Joe, a fellow trucker I knew from the road. He was sitting at the counter, nursing a cup of coffee and reading a newspaper.

“Hey, Bill,” he said, looking up. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I sat down next to him, my legs feeling weak. “You’re not far off,” I said, and I told him what happened.

Joe listened intently, his brow furrowing. When I finished, he shook his head. “That’s messed up, man. You know, I’ve heard stories about people doing that kind of thing. Some are trying to get hit for insurance money, others are just plain crazy.”

“Insurance money? By getting hit by a truck?” I asked, incredulous.

“Yeah,” Joe said, taking a sip of his coffee. “Apparently, if you survive, you can sue the driver or something. It’s stupid, but people do crazy things.”

“But he didn’t look like he was trying to get hit,” I said, my voice low. “He was just kneeling there, like he was waiting for something.”

“Maybe he was high on something,” Joe suggested. “Or having a mental breakdown. You see all kinds of stuff out here.”

I nodded, but I wasn’t convinced. There was something about his pose that seemed almost religious, like he was making a sacrifice. It didn’t sit right with me. I kept picturing his silhouette in my headlights, arms spread wide, as if he was offering himself to the road.

I finished my coffee and decided to try to get some sleep before continuing my journey. But that night, I kept seeing his face in my dreams—his arms outstretched, waiting for me. I woke up in a cold sweat, the image burned into my mind.

The next morning, I checked the news on my phone, but there was no report of any incident on I-5 that night. It was as if it never happened. I called Lisa when I got a chance, needing to hear her voice.

“Hey, honey,” she said, her voice warm but tired. “You okay? You sound off.”

I hesitated, then told her about the man on the road. “It was the creepiest thing I’ve ever seen, Lisa. I don’t know what to make of it.”

“Oh, Bill, that’s awful,” she said. “You sure you’re okay? Maybe you should take a break from driving for a bit.”

“I’m fine,” I lied. “Just shaken up.”

“Well, be careful out there,” she said. “Come home soon.”

“I will,” I promised, but as I hung up, I felt a knot in my chest. I wasn’t sure I was fine at all.

That image will stay with me forever—a reminder of how strange and unpredictable life on the road can be. 





# ""The Night I Escaped"":

It was a warm summer night in 2002, and I was just 15 years old, living in Columbia, South Carolina. That evening, I had gone to a friend's house to watch a movie. We laughed through a silly comedy, ate popcorn, and lost track of time. It was getting late, and I knew I had to be home by midnight, so I hugged my friend, promised to call her tomorrow, and started walking back home. The streets were quiet, with only the hum of crickets and the occasional car passing by. I lived in a nice neighborhood, the kind where people left their doors unlocked, and I felt safe walking alone at night.

As I turned onto a darker street, the streetlights grew dimmer, and the houses were spaced farther apart. I noticed a car slowing down beside me. I glanced over and saw a man inside, but I didn’t think much of it. I figured he was just another driver, maybe lost or looking for a house number. But then, the car stopped, and he got out. He was tall, muscular, with short hair and a look in his eyes that made my skin crawl. He moved fast, too fast, and before I could run or scream, he grabbed my arm and yanked me toward his car.

“Hey, let go!” I shouted, but his hand clamped over my mouth, muffling my voice. My heart pounded so hard I thought it would burst. I kicked and twisted, but he was too strong. He shoved me into the back seat, and the door slammed shut. The smell of his sweat and cheap cologne filled the car, making me gag. He got in the driver’s seat, pulled out a gun, and pointed it at me. “Stay quiet, or you’re dead,” he said, his voice low and cold. I froze, my body trembling as he drove off, taking me away from the safety of my neighborhood.

I tried to focus, to think of a way out, but my mind was a blur of fear. Where was he taking me? What did he want? I thought of my mom, waiting at home, probably checking the clock. I thought of my little brother, asleep in his room. Would I ever see them again? The car turned onto a highway, and the streetlights disappeared, leaving only the glow of the dashboard. I stared at the back of his head, trying to memorize every detail—his short brown hair, the way his shoulders hunched as he drove. If I got out of this, I wanted to remember everything.

We pulled into a parking lot outside a small apartment building. He dragged me out of the car, his grip bruising my arm. “Don’t try anything,” he warned, waving the gun. Inside his apartment, the air was thick with a sour, rotting smell. Clothes and papers were scattered across the floor, and a single lamp cast a dim, flickering light. He pushed me onto the floor and started wrapping duct tape around my wrists and ankles. The tape bit into my skin, and I winced as he tightened it. Then he snapped handcuffs on me, the metal cold and heavy. I was trapped, helpless, lying on a dirty carpet, staring up at a stranger who held my life in his hands.

He knelt beside me, his face too close. “I’ve been watching you,” he said, his voice calm, almost friendly. “I saw you walking home from school, always in that blue backpack. I knew you were the one.” My stomach twisted. He’d been stalking me, planning this. “My name’s Richard,” he added, like we were having a normal conversation. “I’ve done this before.” Those words hit me like a punch. I realized I wasn’t just dealing with a random creep—this was a serial killer.

I tried to keep my breathing steady, to push down the panic. I had to stay sharp, to find a way out. I thought about my dad, who always told me to be tough, to never give up. I thought about my friends, who’d be waiting for me at school tomorrow, wondering where I was. I couldn’t let this be the end. Richard stood up and started pacing, muttering to himself. He seemed nervous, like he wasn’t sure what to do next. I watched him closely, looking for any chance to escape.

Hours passed, though it felt like days. My wrists ached from the tape, and my legs were numb from lying on the floor. Richard kept talking, mostly to himself, about things I couldn’t understand—names, places, things he’d done. Every word made me more certain he wasn’t going to let me go. But then, sometime in the early morning, he sat on the couch and his head started to nod. His muttering stopped, and his breathing slowed. He was asleep.

My heart raced. This was it—my only chance. I tugged at the duct tape on my wrists, ignoring the pain as it tore at my skin. It was tight, but I kept working at it, twisting and pulling until one hand slipped free. I held my breath, glancing at Richard to make sure he was still out. Then I carefully peeled the tape off my ankles, moving as quietly as I could. The handcuffs were still on, but I could stand now, and that was enough.

I scanned the room for a weapon, but there was nothing—no knives, no heavy objects within reach. I had to get out before he woke up. I crept toward the door, my bare feet silent on the carpet. My hands shook as I reached for the doorknob, expecting it to be locked. But then I saw a key on the table nearby. I grabbed it, my fingers fumbling as I tried to fit it into the lock. Every second felt like an eternity, and I kept waiting for Richard to wake up and grab me.

The lock clicked, and I pushed the door open. The cool night air hit my face, and for a moment, I felt a spark of hope. But I wasn’t safe yet. I ran down the street, the pavement rough against my bare feet. The pain didn’t matter—nothing mattered except getting away. I didn’t know where I was, but I kept running, my lungs burning, until I saw a house with lights on. I pounded on the door, my voice hoarse as I screamed, “Help me! Please, help!”

A woman opened the door, her eyes wide with shock. “What’s wrong?” she asked, stepping back as she saw my torn clothes and handcuffs. “He took me,” I gasped, tears streaming down my face. “He’s going to kill me. Please, call the police.” She pulled me inside and locked the door, then grabbed her phone and dialed 911. “There’s a girl here,” she told the operator. “She says someone kidnapped her. Hurry.”

The police arrived in minutes, their sirens cutting through the silence of the night. They took me to the hospital, where doctors checked me for injuries. Physically, I was okay—just some bruises and cuts from the tape. But inside, I was a mess. I couldn’t stop shaking, couldn’t stop seeing Richard’s face, hearing his voice. The police asked me questions, and I told them everything I could remember—the car, the apartment, the smell, his name. I wanted them to find him, to stop him from hurting anyone else.

In the days that followed, I barely slept. Nightmares woke me up, and I kept reliving that night, wondering what would’ve happened if I hadn’t escaped. I felt like I was always looking over my shoulder, expecting him to be there. My parents held me tight, but even their hugs couldn’t chase away the fear.

Weeks later, the police told me they’d found him. His name was Richard Evonitz, a serial killer who had murdered at least three girls in Florida and Virginia. My escape had given them the clues they needed to track him down. He took his own life before they could arrest him, but knowing he was gone brought me some peace. I had survived, and I had helped stop him.

The road to healing was long. Therapy helped me process the trauma, and talking about it made me feel stronger.





# ""No Signal, No Exit"":

I kept my eyes on the dim headlights ahead. The highway stretched out into endless darkness. My little sedan felt vulnerable and alone. The driver’s seat felt hard against my back and I hated it as the car rolled on. I gripped the wheel a little tighter.

“Are we going to make it to the next gas station?” Laura asked from the passenger seat, peering at me in the rearview mirror. Her voice was anxious.  
I glanced down at the fuel gauge. We still had some fuel, I told myself, but the needle was so low it made me nervous.  
“We should be okay,” I lied, trying to sound confident even as my throat felt dry.

The road stretched out in front of us, empty except for our headlights. Neither of us spoke. The only noise was the hum of the tires and the low rumble of the engine as it carried us further into the night. A faint vibration started under my feet as the dashboard lights flickered briefly. I frowned and shifted in my seat.

“Did you hear that?” Laura asked. Her hands gripped the handle above the door.  
I listened carefully. The engine was quiet. The hum of the tires was all I could hear.  
“You’re probably tired,” I said to calm her, but my own voice shook.

We had crossed into a more remote stretch. The last sign we saw said “Gas 40 miles.” Forty more miles. The highway felt endless and empty now. The lights of our car were the only flickers in the darkness.

My vision seemed to focus on a single point far ahead. A faint sparkle moved in the darkness, a glint that looked like metal reflecting our headlights. I blinked, but it stayed there. Was it coming closer, or was I hallucinating from exhaustion?

I squinted. It was a truck, far ahead, slowly coming toward us. Its headlights were dim from the distance.  
“Is that a truck?” Laura whispered.  
“Yeah,” I said quietly. “Probably some rig on a long haul.”  
We watched as it neared. The highway had only one lane each way, so if it got close I would have to move aside. That thought made me uneasy.

But as the truck got closer, I saw a flash of something odd. One of its headlights was broken, replaced by a dull orange lantern light. The truck itself looked battered and old. The cab was rusty and the paint peeling. The glowing amber light was what caught my eye. No modern truck would have that.

The truck drew near. It didn’t pass us but stayed behind, about ten car lengths back. It matched our speed.  
I started to sweat even though the night was cool. Something about it felt wrong. It wasn’t just an old truck. The driver hadn’t passed. Why was he staying behind us?

A wave of dread crawled up my neck. The dark road behind us was swallowed by night. The truck’s lights remained fixed on our car, silent and steady.  
Laura turned in her seat, looking out the rear window. Her eyes were wide.  
“Is that truck following us?” she asked quietly.

I swallowed. I didn’t want to believe it, but it looked like it. “I don’t know,” I said. “It seems to be keeping pace.”  
She pulled her phone out and tried to get a signal. “No bars,” she said. It really was a dead zone.  
“Get off the road,” I said, quietly but urgently. “Pull over or something.”

She blinked. “Right.” I saw the dim red brake lights come on, then fade again as we moved onto the shoulder.  
I eased the wheel onto the gravel. The highway sign said “Next Station: 20 mi.” Great.  
The truck slowed down a little, matching our drop in speed. It was still there, close behind, just far enough for me to see a dirty window. A man’s silhouette hunched over a worn steering wheel.

I locked the car doors with shaking hands. I couldn’t help it; my fingers went numb on the switch. We were sitting ducks on the gravel shoulder.  
The truck slowed to a crawl, pulling up right behind us. It was so close I could see the driver’s eyes glinting beneath the rim of a baseball cap. The man’s face was hidden by shadows, but the dim light inside the cab made me uneasy.

“Are you okay back there?” A rough voice called from the driver’s side window. The man leaned out, balancing himself on the edge of the seat. His skin looked pasty in the yellow light. The engine revved low.  
I took a deep breath, trying to steady my voice. I forced a smile. It was just a truck driver. Probably.  
“Yeah, we’re okay,” I said, though the fear in my throat made the words tight. Laura sat up, eyes on the stranger.  
He leaned closer and I saw the side of his face. He had a long scar near his mouth and dusty blue eyes. There was something off about his smile, like it was stretched too wide.

“You folks need help?” he asked. His accent was low and scratchy.  
Laura glanced at me, and I nodded. “Actually, yes. Our car broke down and ran out of gas. We were hoping to reach that last station but we’re stuck.”  
He scratched his chin. “I’ve got some gasoline I can spare. Follow me up the road and I can fill your tank.”  
Relief washed over me, then suspicion. Was this generous or dangerous?  
Laura kept her eyes on him. “We might get a signal if we step out,” she suggested.  
He eyed us carefully. “Come on now. This isn’t a safe place to stand around. Follow me and you’ll have gas.”

He reached inside the truck to grab something. My breath quickened; his movement made me nervous.  
“What is he doing?” Laura whispered.  
He tossed an empty jerry can onto our trunk. I jumped. “Hey!” I cried as it hit with a thud. Laura stared in shock. The trucker hopped down and strode toward the car.  
“Fill that up,” he said, pointing at the can. “I’ll get the gas.” His eyes flicked to me.  
I locked the doors and pressed myself against the seat. This was weird. But he had offered help.

“I don’t have any cash with me right now,” Laura stammered. “I— I have cards. Just let me get some.”  
He waved a hand in front of her. “No need,” he said. “Just hurry up before someone sees.” His voice lowered. “Just do as I said.”  
I realized his tone had changed. It was no longer friendly.

Suddenly, instinct screamed at me to refuse. “No,” I said quietly. “We’ll stay right here.”  
He glared at me. “Don’t be difficult,” he snapped. “She’ll be right back.” He pointed at Laura. “A woman can pour gas.”  
He tightened his grip on the metal crowbar now in his hand. My eyes widened; his knuckles were white around it.

My car was off the road and blocked by his truck. The road behind was empty darkness. I felt trapped. I watched him carefully.

I needed to think.  
“Look, we appreciate it,” I said, voice steady. “But it’s late. Maybe you should go.”  
He snarled under his breath and didn’t move. His truck’s engine growled quietly.  
My fingers found the flashlight in the glove compartment. I clicked it on and pointed it at him.  
He ducked his head. The light’s beam danced across his chest and the side of his truck, where the company name was half peeled away.  
I might have made a mistake.  
He hurled a heavy tool at the side of my car. Sparks flew as it hit the metal.

His eyes flashed with anger. He lunged forward, raising the crowbar. My heart pounded.  
“Get out of the car,” he ordered, voice low but deadly serious.

“No,” I said, feeling the panic rise. I needed to protect Laura.  
He swung the crowbar at me. I turned the key and slammed the car into gear.  
The tires screeched on gravel. Laura yelped as the car jerked forward. The truck fishtailed, trying to keep up.  
I stomped on the gas.

The car jolted into motion. The engine roared as we sped forward. The truck rammed into the back of us, spinning us around. The cab windows rattled.  
“Jump out!” I screamed at Laura.  
She hesitated, eyes wide as the crowbar smashed against the window beside her.  
He was up at my window now, swinging again.  
“I can’t leave you!” she cried.  
I reached over, undid her seat belt and shoved her toward the passenger door.

She tumbled onto the road shoulder as I swerved to avoid hitting her. I reversed and crashed back onto the highway. A lone headlight approached quickly.  
The truck was still on the road, squealing as it lost grip. It missed hitting her by inches.  
I fought the wheel back toward the shoulder, and the engine backfired as gravel flew.  
The truck halted a short distance ahead, its windows dark and silent.  
For a moment, all was still. I could smell gasoline and fear.

Laura pulled herself up and saw me kill the engine. We sat on the shoulder facing the truck. The driver leaned back in his seat, turned away. He seemed to be thinking.  
I slid the safety catch back on my door.  
“You okay?” I asked quietly.  
She nodded, shaking. I put my arm around her.  
Then we saw it: an old pickup truck with headlights on, parked a hundred feet back. A man was standing near it, phone in hand, watching.

“Help! Police!” I yelled, hoping he heard.  
The trucker spotted him and shifted his big rig into reverse, rumbling forward.  
“Run!” I yelled.  
Laura and I bolted behind the pickup as the trucker gunned his engine, swinging the rig at the stranger.  
The trucker swerved wildly, missing the man but losing control. The big rig skidded and finally stopped, mangled on the side of the road.

I flung open the pickup’s door and jumped in with the man. He hit the hazard lights. Without waiting, I floored it. The tires fought the gravel as we blasted past the stopped truck.  
Laura sat in the backseat, breathing hard but safe.  
I drove on until I found another shoulder. I pulled over. No signal here either, but I could wait. We were alive.

Behind us, the headlights of the wrecked truck faded around a bend. It was over.  
We sat in silence a long moment, finally hearing our hearts slow.

“I think we should never stop on a highway at night again,” Laura said softly.  
I nodded, still gripping the steering wheel. “We got lucky,” I agreed. “Too lucky.”  
We waited and soon the man with the pickup called 911. About an hour later, the highway swarmed with police cars around the truck.

In the morning, a deputy told us a crew of highway thieves had been using an old rig like that to rob drivers. We were safe for now, but luck alone had saved us.  
Laura and I never forgot that night. The highway seemed empty, but it was alive with someone else’s plan.  
We made it home in the dawn light, shaken and grateful.",1,1753493000.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Is it just deceptive and used, or is the coating coming off and I absolutely shouldn't use this pan????

I think knowing the origin would be best but if not is there a good way to test it?

I gave it a light clean with soap, no oil

There are no markings except a G13 on the back of the handle

1m9goqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1m9goqj/03_fáros_stin_kataigída/,03. Fáros stin Kataigída,"Dear You,

I know.

I know how hard it is to trust feelings when your heart has been through so much. When the hands that once reached for you let go too soon. When love has looked like absence, or silence, or someone who couldn't meet you in the thunderstorm of life and couldn’t hold you steady along the way. I know you’ve been let down by those who should have held you better. I know you’ve poured yourself into others who didn’t know how to receive something as rare and whole as your love. I know you’ve had to carry yourself through heartache, through silence, through uncertainty and survival.

And then suddenly there’s me offering something steady and strong. And I know that it's hard to believe anyone could offer care without asking for something in return. I see the way you doubt the kindness I offer, like it must have strings. I hear the way you protect your heart when something feels too gentle to be real. I know you find it hard to believe that you deserve something steady, something safe, something real. And I don’t blame you for any of that. Never. But I want you to know that you do. If anyone does, you do.

I wish you could see yourself through my eyes, not gilded by fantasy or filtered through rose-colored glasses, but raw, real, beautiful you. The woman who feels deeply, gives selflessly, and still dares to hope even when you're broken and exhausted. The you that even you weren’t aware you were showing at times. The you that, when you realized it was present, quietly pulled back. I saw her fade into the shadows, and while I hoped to see her again, I was simply grateful you let me see her at all.

I wish you could feel what I feel when I hear your voice, or read your words, or imagine you in some quiet moment, a beautiful mess, softly laughing, holding space for everyone, yet rarely being held in return. I only wish you knew how deeply I want to hold you. Not with expectation, but with presence. To be buried in you. Engulfed by you.

If only you knew exactly how I felt. If I could place my hands to your heart and pour the truth into you there’d be no room left for doubt. If I could quiet every voice that ever made you feel unworthy, too much, or not enough, and replace them with the way I see you. Hear you. Feel you. Hold you close, even from afar.

What I feel, it isn’t fleeting. It isn’t a fragile, heart-shaped piece of rose quartz. It doesn’t flinch when met by distance. It’s rooted in presence and shaped by choice. It’s in the way I want to offer more than words. I want to show you how I feel through touch, through quiet acts of care, through the consistency of just being there, when you’re happy, when you’re hurting, and when you’re simply existing and want someone close.

And when I speak of presence, I don’t just mean being there emotionally—I mean holding you in a way that reminds you what it feels like to be desired without demand.

The way I want to trace your skin—gentle but firm. The way I want to learn your silences, your rhythms, your softness. And the places where softness gives way to tension, to craving. Not to take it from you, but to offer something.

Safety. Tenderness. Reverence. Gratification.

To show you that being wanted doesn't have to mean being used. That being desired can feel like being worshiped. That your body isn't something to control or quiet, but something to meet fully. Breath to breath, skin to skin, until you're not just seen, but known.

I want to kiss you in the places no one's thought to kiss you before. To trace the curve of your spine with my mouth like a vow. To listen to the way, you whisper need without speaking. To take my time. To draw it out. To undo the guarded parts of you slowly, until surrender feels like safety and pleasure becomes something you no longer apologize for.

Because what I crave isn't just closeness, but depth. The kind that's only found in the quiet moans, the slow unraveling, the trust that lets us both let go.

And these feelings are here to stay. Not in a way that traps or demands, but like a lighthouse; remaining lit, just in case the person at sea ever needs to find their way back to shore.

If you choose me, I’d gladly be that for you.

What I offer, I offer freely. No expectations. No deadlines. Just the honest investment of a man who sees you clearly and still wants to lean in. I offer it because you’ve become a quiet center in my world without even trying. A comfort I look forward to. A presence I miss when it’s gone. And I know you don’t always feel strong or steady, but you’ve been those things for me just by being yourself.

I want to live a life with you, one where we laugh too loud and get caught in the rain sometimes. One where we have coffee together in the morning, smiling over each other’s messy hair, and evenings on the soft couch entangled in each other and a movie. Slow dances in the kitchen. A life where we can argue and still feel safe, because love is never in question. A life where your joy is the rhythm that guides mine.

I want to be the person you lean into at the end of a long day. The quiet presence who holds you without needing you to explain. The hand you hold while we walk on wooded trails. The warmth beside you on the couch. The slow fingertips brushing over your arm as we talk about nothing and everything. I want to be the one who wraps you in the kind of safety you’ve longed for not just physically, but emotionally. A place to fall. A space to land. A home. I want to be your calm in the chaos. Your warmth in the cold. Your soft landing when everything else feels sharp.

I know the kind of trust I’m asking for takes time. I know you’ve been burned by promises and hurt by people who didn’t stay. But I also know what I feel, and I know it’s not going anywhere.

And I wonder sometimes... if maybe the pieces of me I’ve been holding all this time are the very ones your heart has been looking for to feel whole again. Not to fix what’s broken. But to fit—into the places that long to be understood. To love you not for who I hope you become, but for who you already are. Messy. Brave. Guarded. Glorious.

I don’t want to be your escape. I want to be your presence. The steady breath beside you. The soft voice in the dark. The arms that hold you not because you need rescuing but because you deserve to be held.

So, I ask, gently—not to pressure, not to rush, but to offer my puzzle pieces to you:

Will you let me be the arms you can fall into without hesitation?  
Will you let me be your safe place?  
Will you let me be the steady presence in your future?  
Will you let me be the hand that doesn’t let go, the love that holds when the world feels too heavy?  
Will you let me show you, through touch, through kindness, through presence, that the kind of love you long for does exist?  
Will you let me show you that someone can hold you without needing you to shrink or bend or break?  
Will you let me show you that you do deserve that kind of love?

I offer this not as a burden, but as a quiet gift: my heart, missing some pieces, yes, but still perfectly shaped to hold yours. Not because I expect anything in return. Not because I want to rush you. But because I believe in what we could be, if we’re brave enough to try.

You don’t have to answer now. Or soon. Or even at all. If you need time, space, or silence, I’ll honor that.

But please know—whatever your pace, whatever your process—I’ll remain.  
Not waiting with impatience… but staying, with care.

Still.  
Steady.  
Yours, if you’ll have me.",3,1753492876.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False
