1ogojq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1ogojq7/social_anxiety_uk_town_centres_and_dealing_with/,"Social Anxiety , UK town centres and dealing with rowdy random NPCs. Any tips?","I live in a run of the mill UK midlands town, bang in the middle of town and I have been really challenging myself lately -  for various reasons- to go out regularly as I have been stuck in the house mostly for a year plus and more. I used to only go out when I needed to do something, i.e. not often. I work from home. I started building a routine now because of my ADHD meds where I try to go out 6 days a week and do daily shops and a walk. I find it increasingly difficult however to do so because the town i live is full of idiots who come up to you for whatever reason. Not talking about homeless people- I have no issue with that. I give them change. 


My wife sometimes for example likes me to get her the odd quarter pounder from town because she's low on iron and everytime I go in there, I feel like I need a stab proof vest. Youths going crazy and rowdy. People come up to you to talk to you as well for no reason or you look at them for a split second and they go like ---what you looking bruv you wanna start. It's making me panic and also frustrated. Firstly ""bruv"" you're 14, shut up. Second, do I have a sign in my head that says I want to converse with you? The amount of times I'd get shoved and pushed for no reason because no one has spacial awareness is insane. And you don't know if they're having a banter fight with each other or actually trying to murder each other. 

I should have the right to go about town without pr*cks/roadmen or other idiots bothering me. We accommodate other illnesses in this country, why can't we accommodate anxiety and panic attacks?

But no I cannot even sit on a bench and listen to music without people being weird. I had a random drunk lady come up to me and ask to shake my hand and say I like your hair. Ok thanks but why bother me? I have enough social anxiety as it is . Like where is the British etiquette, please?

I want to be able to walk around, get my exercise, a coffee, sit somewhere, listen to some music maybe and get fresh air, be alone yet this town and I'm sure other towns make it a nightmare to do so. Do I need to sell a kidney and move next to St Paul Cathedral in Central London next to all the finance guys to enjoy not having to deal with this? 

The only place I can truly feel alone ironically enough is central London, no one bothers you there and no one looks you in the eye. No one weird at least (zone 1 or 2 mostly). If it was just homeless asking for change again, I have no issue with that, I give them change and tell to have a nice day. It's everyone else that bothers me that isn't homeless- especially rowdy testosterone people high on strong weed or high on masculinity- people looking for a fight for whatever reason with strangers.

How do you guys with anxiety deal with living in run down towns and NPCs. It's panic after panic for me. I'm really trying to push myself to go out but it's difficult. ",1,1761495087.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1ogoiak,https://i.redd.it/eg22tj9zchxf1.jpeg,5.7 to 5.4 in 2 months!,"I was stunned to discover I was pre-diabetic 2 months ago since I exercise 5+ times a week (strength training, gym, Pilates, yoga, walking) and eat pretty healthy. Sure I can lose 10 pounds but nothing serious (5’3”, 138 pounds, post-menopausal 56 year old woman). My aunt has T2 diabetes and her son, my cousin, has T1 diabetes). 

I was determined to reverse it and amped up my exercise for at least 10 minutes after every meal, eliminating rice and refined sugar (no ice cream for 2 months!), and reducing fruit. I used a CGM for 6 weeks to learn about spikes, which foods affected me, and how exercise reduced my blood sugar. Took 4 trips over 2 months and even managed to keep up my routine as my friends all ate delicious foods! 

I decided if my A1C didn’t decline I was going on Metformin, since my routine just wasn’t sustainable. So I was thrilled to reduce from 5.7 to 5.4 in just 2 months. Now I feel like I can ease off a bit and enjoy my life. I still eat oatmeal or unsweetened Greek yogurt every morning. But can have 3/4 cup of frozen berries instead of 1/2 cup (in addition to hemp hearts, chia seeds, cashews, pumpkin seeds). I was exercising twice every morning (once after my morning coffee, and again after breakfast) and have reduced to once a morning.

1ogohhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ogohhx/saw_a_girl_in_a_blue_dress_off_mile_42_last_night/,Saw a girl in a blue dress off mile 42 last night. She saved my life.,"People around here call her The Prom Ghost.

You'll hear about her if you stop long enough at any gas station off Route 19 — always from someone older, someone who swears their cousin’s friend's dad saw her back in the early 2000s. A teenage girl in a light blue prom dress, soaked to the bone, barefoot, standing by the guardrail after midnight.

Some say she's looking for a ride home.
Others say she's looking for him.

I didn't believe a word of it — not until last Thursday.

It was close to 1:00 a.m. when I left a late delivery run. Rain was hammering the windshield, my wipers struggling to keep up. The road out of town was empty, just miles of slick pavement and the rhythmic sound of tires on wet asphalt.

That's when I saw her.

She was standing on the shoulder near mile marker 42, right under a flickering streetlight — long black hair plastered to her face, wearing a light blue dress that shimmered whenever lightning flashed.

At first, I thought she'd been in an accident. I slowed down, rolled the window down just enough to shout.

""Hey! You okay?""

She turned slowly toward me. Her skin was so pale it almost glowed in my headlights, and her eyes — bright, icy blue — locked on mine.

""Can you take me home?"" she asked. Her voice was quiet, but somehow I heard it over the rain.

I hesitated. She didn’t look hurt, just cold and lost. Against my better judgment, I unlocked the passenger door.

She slid in without a sound. The seat barely moved under her weight. Her dress was dripping wet, but the water never touched the seat fabric. I noticed that immediately.

""Where do you live?"" I asked, trying to sound casual.

She looked straight ahead.
""Just past the bridge. You'll see it.""

There isn't a bridge on that road. At least… there hadn""t been for years. The old one was torn down in 2007 after a bad flood.

I figured maybe she meant one of the overpasses near the highway, so I kept driving.

That's when I started to notice the air inside the truck — cold, freezing cold — like someone had turned the AC all the way up. I glanced at the vents. They were off.

Then she whispered, ""You should slow down.""

The tone in her voice wasn't scared. It was warning.

A second later, my headlights lit up a downed tree sprawled across the road — a second too late. I slammed the brakes, swerved hard, barely missing it. My heart was hammering in my chest.

I turned to thank her.

But she was gone.

The seat was empty, not even damp. Just a faint smell of lilacs in the air — old-fashioned perfume.

I sat there for a long time, rain still pounding against the windshield. Eventually, I turned around and drove back toward town, shaken but alive.

The next day, I stopped by a local diner I usually hit for coffee. I told the waitress what I'd seen — half joking, trying to make sense of it.

Her smile faded.
""You mean Sylvia?""

I blinked. ""You know her?""

""Everyone does."" she said quietly. ""She died back in 2003. On prom night. Her boyfriend lost control of the car on that old bridge during a storm. They say she crawled out and tried to flag someone down before the bridge gave out completely.""

I didn't finish my coffee.

Now, every time it rains, I can't help looking at the side of the road as I drive past mile 42.

Sometimes, in the corner of my mirror, I think I see a flicker of blue in the headlights — and I slow down, just in case.

Because if the stories are true, she doesn’t haunt people.

She warns them.

And maybe she's still trying to save the ones she couldn't that night.",2,1761494940.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1ogogac,https://i.redd.it/rk4etzw0chxf1.png,How to get into Ivy League using this study method,"Last year, I got the email I’d been dreaming about for years: “Welcome to Harvard 2028.” a year before that I was failing,I couldn’t focus for more than 20 minutes, my GPA was tanking,  sooo here are the list of things that actually changed everything for me:

**1. Time-block like you actually have a job**  
Instead of saying “I’ll study later”, I plan study blocks on Google Calendar and treat them like real meetings. This short video helped me a ton:  
[https://youtu.be/3s2gS3pFHPg?si=IqrgZHtma3TpiDIb](https://youtu.be/3s2gS3pFHPg?si=IqrgZHtma3TpiDIb)  
  
**2. Study with others**  
I started using [this site](https://www.studystream.live/home?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=13) it’s a 24/7 virtual coworking space where you join live focus rooms with other students. No talking, just accountability. Seeing 200+ people studying in real time kills procrastination, like you are in library  
  
**3. The “5-minute activation” trick**  
When I don’t feel like studying, I promise myself *5* minutes only. That small start almost  
There’s some science behind it, it’s called the “activation energy” principle (worth Googling if you’re curious).  
  
**4.  Lower the pressure, raise the consistency**  
Stop chasing the “perfect study day.” Two consistent hours a day beats ten chaotic ones.  
I stopped aiming for motivation and started building systems. 

**5. “Different chair, different task”**  
Desk = notes.  
Bed = reading.  
Couch = review.  
Your body learns context cues, it’s like conditioning focus into spaces

**6. Block distractions like your life depends on it**  
Apps like [Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/) and [Freedom](https://freedom.to/?irpid=56411&subId1=1-g-Cj0KCQjw3aLHBhDTARIsAIRij59hh05xb2IZShD_m6lS1d-RfMCHXEJSPbPmD3qoIusw2i618xexT_gaAqI1EALw_wcB&utm_source=affiliate&utm_campaign=56411&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=808733665&gbraid=0AAAAADLv4uSBNq1p5LzMwxGpG1MCeruAH&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3aLHBhDTARIsAIRij59hh05xb2IZShD_m6lS1d-RfMCHXEJSPbPmD3qoIusw2i618xexT_gaAqI1EALw_wcB) are lifesavers, but honestly, the simplest hack is to put your phone in another room. If you want to understand why your brain keeps reaching for it, this video blew my mind: [ Why you can’t focus – Andrew Huberman explains dopamine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwQhKFMxmDY)

**7. Romanticize the process**  
Make your study setup feel good, clean desk, warm lighting, lo-fi beats, your favorite drink. It may seem silly, but the brain needs a lot of order.

**8. Reward yourself like you’re training a dog (because you kind of are)**  
 I set small rewards: finish a chapter: take a coffee. finish an assignment: 15 min scroll.  
 This alspo sounds silly, but it trains your brain to associate focus with pleasure.  
  
**9.Get sunlight before screens**  
10 minutes outside before opening a laptop = focus upgrade.  
Resets your circadian rhythm and improves dopamine regulation.  
[Huberman – Why Morning Sunlight is Crucial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PzZy3QX0qI)

**10. Keep a “done list” instead of a “to-do list”**  
Writing what I completed instead of what I still need to do gives a crazy dopamine boost.  
I track mine in Notion

**11. Change locations once a day**  
Studying in the same spot drains you. I rotate between my desk, a café, or my bed (controversial, I know). If you can’t leave home, just change the lighting or background music. it tricks your brain into a “fresh start.”

**12. Mix subjects and methods**  
Alternate between reading, note-taking, and active recall. Active recall literally reprograms your memory [ Ali Abdaal’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukLnPbIffxE) explains it way better than I can.[](https://www.studystream.live/home?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=13)",6,1761494859.0,studytips,0,1.0,False

When I F was 17 years old, my stepsister (same age) and I had always gone back and forth on whether we got along. From picking on each other to straight not speaking. When we were younger (5) our parents first got together & we were besties but blended families are hard. Anyways when I was 17 I egged her car and lied about it. Yes I know it was a very stupid and immature thing to do BUT I was 17 and didn’t really consider the consequences at the time. I now 32 have reached out 5 times over the years. Immediately after I apologized in a letter. Again after boot camp, and on 2 different deployments. The last time I tried I was 27 and asked my mom to ask her if she would be willing to have lunch or coffee w me and she said and I quote “too much time has past it’ll be too awkward” so I took that as my sign to stop trying. 
Now I have to give another back story to bring these two together. When I went to boot camp (17 years old) and upon returning home I brought home my boyfriend (black, not that that should matter but it unfortunately does in this story) I introduced him to my step grandparents (stepdads parents) and actually dinner was great. Afterwards things completely changed. I was told I was told by my parents that I was never welcome in their home or presence whether I stayed w him or not.. I never thought I would have to consider MY FAMILY being racist but here we were. That was 15 years ago and I wrote off my step grandparents a smile on my face. Their loss. 

So. Fast forward to now, 15 years later. I got a text message from my step grandmother AND my step sister in the SAME week. Reaching out practically acting like nothing happened and we haven’t been silent for 15 years. My step grandfather past away a week before the texts came. Who I also had not seen or spoken to in 15 years. Nor did I attend the funeral or celebration of life. Now back to the texts. My sister said something along the lines of “you’ll always be my sister, I love you… blah blah blah” and my parents don’t get why I refuse to “jump” when I feel like their now ready now that someone died. & I feel like had that not happened I wouldn’t have heard from either one. My grandmothers message said something along the lines of “we need to catch up” My question Reddit. AITAH for not responding to either one? My parents want me to just let it go and move on. But they (my parents) never acknowledged what either one did to me and want me to let them back into my life. For context. My parents haven’t necessarily always looked out for my best interest. It’s always been more about how it makes the family look vs what’s actually best for me or how it affects me. My bio grandparents were also my legal guardians for half my life so my parents dismissing my feelings isn’t really the end of the world to me. Just trying to help you all understand. I don’t feel like ITAH in this situation but it’s been over a year now since I’ve received those texts and it’s still on my mind..

I’m shopping for my first pickup and I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed by the options. I would love to get some advice here. 

In my case, I started a small coffee business and I need to tow a small food trailer (about 7,000 lbs) a few weekends a month to sell coffee at the local farmers’ markets. But also this will be our family vehicle in a dense, urban area with tight parking, so I’d prefer to avoid full-size trucks (e.g., F-150).

We test-drove the Ford Ranger and really liked it, but there’s no hybrid option. My wife loves the Ford Maverick—especially the hybrid—but its 4,000-lb max tow rating won’t work for us.

Question: Are there any midsize pickup trucks similar to the Ranger that offer a hybrid powertrain and could handle ~7,000 lbs of towing?

Booking have give me a €300 as a goodwill gesture, but not as cash, as vouchers to spend with them. I have emailed the CEO and am waiting for a response, below is the review that I will be putting on after my checkout date, which is 29th Oct, even though we ended up leaving on 18th Oct, as we did not feel safe. Any valid comments would be appreciated :-) Thanks in advance

**THE REVIEW**

Where to begin? We arrived on 30th September for what was meant to be a 29-night stay. At first glance, the apartment appeared very nice, seeming recently renovated. However, appearances were misleading, and from day one we noticed obvious issues that should have been identified and fixed before any guests arrived. The problems discovered on the first days included:

1. A leaking kitchen tap.
2. A leaking sink in the upstairs bathroom.
3. The towel rail in the upstairs bathroom was hanging off.
4. The upstairs shower was leaking.
5. The seals on the upstairs shower door kept falling off.
6. A hole in the back wall of the upstairs shower allowed water to seep behind the tiles.
7. The top of the coffee machine was broken.

I reported all these faults, and except for the coffee machine, they were repaired after a few days and several visits from a handyman. However, since the bathroom floor was tiled, it became slippery and unsafe, so we couldn’t use it until repairs were completed. I told the property managers that these things happen and left it at that. A few days later, I noticed the ceiling fans were quite dirty. Since it was an easy task, I cleaned them and informed the property host. Their response was that the fans were dirty due to a calima, a sandstorm, we had not had a sandstorm since we arrived, and asking other occupants who lived in the complex, confirmed the same, also the kitchen fan was covered in grease, sandstorms dont produce kitchen grease, the fans had not been cleaned for weeks. They also said that if I had informed them earlier, they would have had the fans cleaned. Hello? Maybe if the apartment had been checked before we arrived, they would have already noticed the dirt and been cleaned, along with all the other faults.

A few days later, when I switched off a light, the switch crackled. We became concerned because it was an older apartment and hadn’t been updated much. We reported this, along with the fact that there were no smoke alarms in the two-storey apartment. We were told someone would inspect the switch and that under Gran Canaria law, smoke alarms are not required. They sent me a link outlining the minimum equipment required by Spanish law. I expressed my concern as a guest and requested a smoke alarm, but this was refused. Also the apartment was advertised as having smoke alarms and fire extinguishers, but that has since been removed, but is still displaying on agoda.com. To me, this is a serious safety issue that should have been addressed by the property managers. Additionally, a few days later, a light in the living room turned on by itself—safe, right?

The link I was sent stated that a first aid kit must be provided. I asked where it was and was told it had been removed and would be replaced. This suggests the property managers did not check the apartment after the previous guests left or before new guests arrived, which is something that should be done by someone paid to manage a holiday rental. All these faults, plus this new one, made us feel unsafe in the apartment. On the same day, I found a fire extinguisher in the complex, but it had not been inspected and the gauge showed it was empty. Also, there was no plan in the apartment indicating where to find fire extinguishers. The handyman replaced the faulty light switch, but by then we felt unsafe, so he went to his apartment and gave us a smoke alarm he had. However, it was faulty and over ten years old, exceeding the recommended usage period, leaving us without fire warnings.

I found the same apartment advertised on Agoda.com, which listed a smoke alarm as safety equipment. When I told the management team, they said all information on Booking.com is automatically transferred to Agoda by Booking.com, so that just confirms to me that it was originally advertised on booking.com as having that safety equipment as well.

We had a few ants in the apartment from day one, but they were not bothersome. However, during the third week, we were infested with hundreds. I reported this and was told to provide video proof because apparently my word wasn’t enough. After supplying proof, I was told someone would fumigate, but it was a problem throughout the complex. So why was it not an issue until I reported it? I was informed a fumigator would come, and I asked if he could visit our apartment first as we planned to go out. He did, expressing surprise at the number of ants. He performed a non-toxic fumigation and said he was only treating our apartment that day, with others to be done over the next few days. If it was a complex-wide problem, why wasn’t the entire complex fumigated immediately? This suggests the property hosts are just make excuses and also are willing to cloud the truth. The exterminator told me that the poison was non toxic so we could stay in the apartment, and it works within a few hours. More than 24 hours later, we were still infested with ants, I again expressed our dissatisfaction with the hosts, and sent video evidence, but was told that as a non toxic solution was used, it takes longer to work, this again is just an excuse as the guy who done the job said within a few hours. Where he fumigated, most the ants had gone, but a lot of them just appeared in another place in the apartment, which was on the video I sent to the host.

I know they manage four other properties in the complex and others elsewhere. If they manage those as they did ours, I feel sorry for those guests. They seem to mask faults with fresh paint, including water damage, take up to 30% commission from owners, and hope guests don’t notice problems. Because of this, we cut our vacation short from 29 nights to 18, feeling unsafe and frustrated that the fumigation didn’t work as promised since ants remained after 24 hours. We simply couldn’t stay any longer. When I contacted the hosts, they told me to take my concerns to Booking.com. I did, and Booking suggested requesting a refund for lost nights and compensation for the inconvenience. The host refused both. If you’re considering booking accommodation managed by this family, I recommend looking elsewhere or proceeding with caution. They focus on appearances but neglect underlying issues unless guests report them, prioritising money over guest comfort and safety.

I was told by the host in a WhatsApp message that:

“Regarding maintenance in the apartment, as in many properties in the Canary Islands, please note that being located right by the sea naturally requires regular upkeep. Thank you for pointing this out in your message; we will certainly pass it on to the property owner so that proper measures can be taken. We are only the property managers, so unfortunately, we are not authorised to carry out any renovations ourselves.”

So, manage the property properly instead of leaving it to guests to report faults that should be spotted during pre-arrival checks. I asked for the contact details of the owners who live in Germany, but they refused to provide them. I wonder why!

Additionally, the licence number displayed on both Booking.com and Agoda was incorrect and was only changed after I pointed it out, but it is still not right, I also checked the other properties on the complex, and the licence numbers are also not accurate, I have reported this to the CEO of Booking.com and also the relevant authorities in Gran Canaria, so they can investigate this.

I also noticed that my booking confirmation advertised “Single-room air conditioning for guest accommodation,” but there is no air conditioning in the entire apartment—another inaccuracy, and if you search for the property, it still advertises “Single-room air conditioning for guest accommodation”, it did also at the time of booking advertise a private beach, there is no private beach and that facility has since been removed.

On 24th October 2025, I noticed that the host re-advertised the property as available from 24th to 29th October, despite me having paid to stay until the 29th and not checking out until then. They have not offered any refund and seem to care only about money, not guest satisfaction, and what you see from them is just a facade. During my stay there, I saw guests leave apartments supposedly managed by this family, and all that happened was a cleaner came by, no checks by the family paid to manage it to ensure the apartment was fit for purpose and free of faults, what makes it worse is two family members managing the properties actually live in the complex.

Last year, we stayed in a different complex in Playa Del Cura for six weeks without problems. That property was managed by a private host who owned the apartment, not by a family management team seemingly interested only in money rather than proper management.",1,1761494212.0,u_tonydav43,0,1.0,False

True realisations often end with what if. 
What if it happens. What if I fly, I am falling anyways. The month of Chances. Possibilities. Probabilities. Questioning the odds and betting on yourself. A fight with destiny, Twisting of fate. 

October ends with acceptance. Not sure if in a spiritual way. But in my own way.

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I (31F) met this guy, let’s call him Mark (25M), a few months ago. Now before I go into more of the issue, you need to know a little background story about me.

Even though I am now in my 30s, I don’t necessarily have the most experience when it comes to men and dating as I have only ever had one relationship my whole life. I met my now ex-husband when I was 16. We were high school sweethearts, dated for 9 years, got engaged and were married for almost 3 years before I filed for divorce in June of last year. It was a really difficult decision for me to leave him after almost 14 years together because he was the only guy I‘ve ever dated and I loved him from the bottom of my heart, but he was a serial cheater (which I only found out after we split) and had pretty much been cheating on me since the day we met, he got addicted to drugs during our 2 year engagement, and later also became physically abusive towards me. 

To be very honest, this relationship gave me MAJOR trust issues and I wasn‘t ready to date for the longest time after my divorce. Yes, I had a few casual hookups here and there, but nothing serious as I was just unable to put myself out there and trust anyone again. But I have started therapy and I‘m currently working through my trauma and trying to heal from the past.

Now, this is where Mark comes in. Mark works part-time at a hookah lounge alongside his regular 9-5 and it‘s at this bar that I met him one afternoon. Him and I come from the same cultural background and I have a necklace that I‘m always wearing that is basically a map of our country and he immediately recognized it and commented on it so I understood that he comes from the same culture as me because it’s not a very well known map/country so usually only our own people recognize it. We got into talking a bit, he seemed very cute (he was actually wearing a matching necklace to mine) and I really enjoyed our conversation so when he asked me for my Instagram, I gave it to him. 

The first few weeks, we were texting constantly and getting to know each other. He would send me good morning texts as soon as he woke up and regularly check in with me throughout the day, even when he was at work. It took a while for us to go on a first “date” because he always claimed to be too busy because he works two jobs which I understood and didn‘t have an issue with at first; I can respect someone working hard and I don’t expect for me to be the center of anyone‘s universe, especially so early on when we’re still just getting to know each other. The first “date”, however, turned out to be just him picking me up late at night, going for a quick walk in a very empty park, and then dropping me back off at home. 

Again, I don‘t mind going on cute little dates like this, going for a cup of coffee or a stroll or even a little picnic is absolutely fine by me, I don‘t need him to take me on a fancy dinner and pay a ridiculous amount of money, for me it’s much more about spending quality time together and having a good, geniune connection. But thinking back now with everything else that has happened since then, I can‘t help but feel like this should have been my first red flag.

Anyway, to get back to the story, this went on for weeks. We never really went on an actual date, where we would go out and spend more than an hour or two together. The only thing that he ever really “had time for” was for him to pick me up in the middle of the night and we would either sit in his car in front of my house or go for a drive before he‘d drop me off again. He did take me to his place a few times where we‘d watch a movie or something, but even then halfway through he‘d tell me he has to go meet up with his brother or his cousins and he‘d take me back home. All of this was very irritating to me, but I‘m a major people pleaser so it‘s very difficult for me to confront people about their behavior and I always try to just keep the peace even if it means hurting myself along the way.

Now, last month, something randomly came up and I had to take a last-minute trip back to my home country for 2 weeks for some paperwork I needed to finish. It was urgent, I told him about it, he understood and he said he‘d wait for me to come back so we can go on a proper date. During my 2 weeks away, everything was fine and he was still always texting me, telling me how much he missed me and how he couldn‘t wait for me to come back. I have been back for almost a month now and ever since then it‘s just been him either ghosting me for days or just acting very strange. 

He makes zero effort into trying to see me or even just for us to meet and talk about things. I‘ve seen him only a handful of times since I’ve been back and that‘s also only because I stopped by the hookah lounge while he was working; once to give him some souvenirs I had brought back for him from my trip and another time to drop off some homemade food.

He keeps making plans to meet up with me, but then cancels them last minute. And I did tell him a few times that I didn’t appreciate this kind of behavior and if he didn’t want to see me, he should just be honest about it and tell me upfront rather than just stringing me along for no reason, but he keeps swearing that it’s not like that, that I’m misunderstanding him and that he’s just very busy with work and some family problems he has going on.

Earlier this week, he texted me one day and told me that a cousin of his had died in an accident which of course broke my heart and I asked how I could help and that if he wanted to talk, I‘d be there. He told me he would just go to work and distract himself that way cause he‘s not someone that talks about his feelings much which I respected and didn‘t push him on it further because everyone deals with grief in their own way. But tell me why when I went there 2 days ago (I was meeting some friends there that night cause they had a live music event going on) Mark was nowhere to be found, but had the audacity to text me and tell me he‘d be super busy at work tonight cause the bar was packed.

I let it go and didn‘t confront him about it, which I probably should have, but now he’s been ghosting me since the day and I haven’t heard anything from him. Am I crazy or is this the behavior of someone who secretly has a girlfriend and I have unknowingly become his side chick that he‘s now trying to get rid of? I can’t help but feel so used and taken advantage of, but I also don’t know if I’m just projecting my own trauma from my previous relationship onto him.

1ognso4,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1ognso4/struggling_with_jealousy_and_considering_ending_a/,Struggling with jealousy and considering ending a relationship,"I (27F) have been with my partner Mark (30M) for just over three years. Mark has been with his partner Anna for around ten years.

I want to give some context by saying that I’m going through a very stressful time at the moment. I’ve just finished my PhD and I’m starting a new job in a new city, away from Mark. My new job also includes a part-time Master’s degree. On top of that, I’m having some family issues, as my sister recently cut contact with me. All in all, I’m under a lot of pressure right now and I’m feeling very untethered and insecure.

As a bit of backstory, Mark and Anna used to be engaged but deescalated when Anna moved to another city, just before I met Mark. They initially tried to stay primary partners, and that was the situation when Mark and I first got together. At the time, we were doing more of a casual relationship, but now we’re very serious and have talked about our future together, including living together, marriage, and children.

Because of the length of their relationship, Anna is very integrated into Mark’s life. All of his friends and family know and love her. This was a bit of a point of contention early in our relationship, as Mark hadn’t told his family that he was poly and didn’t tell them about me until about a year into us being together. I felt really awful about this. The first Christmas after we got together, I met Anna for the first time for coffee with Mark, and they were talking about all the presents they’d got for each other’s parents. It made me very sad. This kind of thing has repeated itself a few times throughout our relationship.

It’s all come to a head in the past few days, as we’ve been celebrating Mark’s birthday with a few days away in a big house with all of his friends and family. It has been extremely difficult for me. We discussed boundaries beforehand, like none of us sharing a bed since they’re all singles, but I’ve still found myself feeling truly horrible.

I’ve seen Anna and Mark being affectionate with each other, and Anna interacting with Mark’s family and childhood friends, and I’ve felt incredibly jealous. Everyone already knows and loves her, while I’ve had to introduce myself to a lot of people. I feel completely isolated and silly. I know this is probably mostly in my head, and I don’t think anyone else is reading into it, but it’s still making me feel awful. I also know that this is just a function of how long Anna and Mark have been together.

Lately I’ve started doubting whether I can be in this relationship anymore. I’ve been seriously considering breaking up with Mark, and it absolutely breaks my heart to even think about it, because we love each other so much. I don’t even know what I’d say or how I’d do it.

PokerListings went through his original post and all the comments below it. Now, we’re sharing an average player’s opinion on playing GTO at low stakes in 2025.

https://preview.redd.it/ezd3bgrd7hxf1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f7e1cb46bf9afbb4ba8206a4cb0ea4fd96c066c

# “F#ck Solvers”: The Summary of wilsyo’s Opinion

As a 20-year-old low stakes poker grinder who introduced himself as Kyle Butler, **wilsyo** confessed to struggling with his enormous GTO knowledge when facing not-so-enlightened opponents:

*“But these creatures at the table… they do not care. They mock me. 5 people limp, I raise to 15BB, but they still all call me… I flop top pair top kicker. But by the time flop action is on me, the frat boy on the table already 3-bet jams over two OMCs*

*The OMC limps under the gun with aces, then limp-calls my 3-bet like it’s 2004 and proceeds to slowroll me while telling a story about his dog at showdown. Across the table, a maniac in a hoodie 4-bets 9-4 offsuit because he “felt like it” and spikes two pair on the flop and crushes my Aces on a K94 board. My solver didn’t predict this. GTO Wizard never warned me about vibes.”*

For your information, OMC means Old Man Coffee — a specific type of player who is tight, passive and quite straightforward in their play. Think of maniacs are the opposite.

So, after battling against real imperfect people instead of mathematically ideal opponents for hours, **wilsyo** questioned his choice of strategy and direction of poker development:

Where is the justice? Where is the balance? My life’s work, the countless nights of range construction, the EV calculations, the RNG apps, and also my superior intelect all rendered meaningless by retirees and chaos agents. I used to believe in game theory. Now I believe in pain. And I believe in my gambling debt.

As a result, he decided to say goodbye to GTO and publicly proclaim solvers bad for low stakes.

# Why Some People Are Against GTO Play at Low Stakes

The average opinion under **wilsyo’s** post can be summarized into one thought: **GTO isn’t applicable in games where people do not consider it at all.**

Low stakes, especially live, are affordable for a lot of recreational players who pay for buy-ins by spending their entertainment money. These people, with the rare exception, are weak players who just want to have fun or try their luck for a couple of hundred bucks. The mathematical side of poker, optimal strategy, even ranges are white noise to them. They’re here to relieve stress and have a good time at the tables.

Exploiting based on your observations of your opponents’ tendencies is still the best option when it comes to low stakes, as [GrnMeansGO](https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1ody57x/comment/nl1srxj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) explained to the topic starter in the comments:

Realize it’s 1/3, they are limping, half drunk, full of egos to just win pots, and don’t give a shit so it doesn’t even matter and just use your brain.

However, as **GrnMeansGO** continued, this doesn’t mean that solvers and GTO are completely useless for low stakes players, you just need to use them in the right way:

Learn patterns and behaviors from sims then extrapolate. Use custom solving tools like HRC or the AI function with wiz to refine your sims to reality.

# How to Use GTO to Level Up Your Game at Low Stakes

First of all, remember that **solver approved** **formulas and charts aren’t concrete**, as [**lifeleavesscars**](https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1ody57x/comment/nkzt69e/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) said. They’re used only to know the best play vs the best play:

If someone is doing the absolute wrong thing every time, gto doesn’t work as well (and sometimes not at all). Your strategy should be whatever works at that specific hand/ table/ opponent.

So, you should follow these guidelines if you want to try achieving the perfect play at low stakes:

1. Study hands in solvers with specific attention to the field’s deviations from the optimal baseline. You should know what GTO says to understand and adjust to how bad your opponents play.
2. Use solver outputs to uncover your own mistakes and leaks, but also to understand the game instead of trying to gain information for memorizing. You can’t memorize every decision for every situation but by trying to do so you increase the risk of mixing diverse information into one soup of errors. Stop wasting your time, energy and headspace on something literally useless.
3. Consider following GTO principles when you meet other professionals at the table but remember that they also can make mistakes.
4. Do not rely on solvers output when it comes to multiway spots. They are often too complicated and unpredictable in development to be solved.
5. Edit ranges and betting frequencies to make them as close to the reality of your game as possible. Do not expect that the solver knows how your opponents play, you should enter this information manually.

And finally: **forget GTO completely if you are sure that your opponents do not even hear about optimal play or game theory**. For beating them you should solely follow their patterns and rely on exploiting their weaknesses.

I met a woman (26) online. I’m 28 myself. We got along really well, exchanged some messages, and she very quickly suggested meeting up. She had given me a few details about herself, so I decided to suggest grabbing a coffee. She said Saturdays are too crowded there, so she proposed something else (Friday evening) and asked me to make a reservation for Saturday (yesterday).

So, yesterday morning I called to book a table but couldn’t because they were expecting two large groups. The staff suggested that we just show up — we might have to wait a little, but they’d find us a spot. I texted her to let her know and even suggested a backup plan. She was happy about that (around noon).

At 2 p.m., she messaged me saying she couldn’t make it because she had to help her mother. I was disappointed but understood — these things happen. I just wanted to quickly reply that I’d seen her message before heading out (we were supposed to meet at 3 p.m.), but when I tried, I realized I was blocked.

We had a really good vibe going — she had even talked to me about some kinky stuff, so it felt like things were clicking. She’d told me right from the start how incredibly attractive she found me. We even had a phone call last week. It definitely wasn’t a fake profile…

**MONEY DIARY**

**Sunday**

* **12:23 a.m.:** Work is going smoothly tonight! I get hungry way earlier than I’m used to, so I head to lunch. I eat leftover Korean fried chicken and rice from date night. I finish up charting and visit my family friend in a nearby unit between med passes.
* **7:05 a.m.:** I wrap up everything for the night and give report to the day shift nurses. I grab my things, clock out, and head home.
* **8:10 a.m.:** I put my stuff away and run upstairs. I wash my face, apply moisturizer, turn on my air purifier, play white noise on my laptop, insert earplugs, put on a face mask, and go to sleep.
* **5:10 p.m.:** I get up after my second alarm. I make my bed and get ready for the day. My parents went grocery shopping and replenished our snack area. I pack my lunch bag and eat my current breakfast hyper-fixation: mini bagels with goat cheese, tomato jam, and egg on the side. I chug my coffee and head to work.
* **6:55 p.m.:** I clock in and hang out in the break room until the team huddle. I get report from the day team and get myself organized for the day. I only have two rooms, so I will be the next postpartum admission.

**Total: $0**

**Monday**

* **12:45 a.m.:** I finish charting and head to lunch. I heat up my Italian sausage ravioli and snack on popcorn, a cheese stick, & treat myself to a Reese's peanut butter cup while I get report on my new patient.
* **7:10 a.m.:** I try to complete as many newborn tasks as I can before the next shift, but I simply cannot. I stumble over myself while giving day shift report. Partially due to a brain fart and partially because a lot of things went down in the last 30 minutes of the shift! At least I did my best! I put my stuff together, clock out, and head home.
* **8:20 a.m.:** I say hi to my dogs, put my stuff away, and head upstairs. I take a long, hot shower, which is much needed. I FaceTime with N, my boyfriend, to catch up and plan our night out. We’re going to the Cage The Elephant concert tonight! I fall asleep and hope that my future self will get up at a reasonable hour.
* **3:00 p.m.:** I do not get up at a reasonable hour. I try to get up at 2 p.m. on my first day off so I can switch to a close-to-normal schedule. I groggily get ready, eat breakfast, and drink coffee before I head to N’s house.
* **4:30 p.m.:** I get to N’s house and try not to take a nap. I failed. I wake up once he gets home. He quickly changes, and we head out. I awkwardly wait on hold before ordering a pizza from our favorite spot.
* **6:30 p.m.:** Our pizza was ready right when we got there! I pay for dinner tonight as N paid for our last date night **($20.14)**. We practically inhale our dinner (10/10) and head over to our reserved parking space.
* **7:05 p.m.:** We find our seats at the venue, which has a significantly better view than I thought it would! We get settled and watch the play-by-play of the Lions’ game while the first opener plays. I start feeling a headache come on, probably because I’m dehydrated, and the flashing lights. I only have anti-nausea meds on me, so I tough it out.
* **9:00 p.m.:** Cage The Elephant comes onto the stage, and N and I switch seats because I can’t see behind the person in front of me. I get lightheaded after a few minutes of standing. I intermittently switch between standing up and sitting down throughout the entire concert, so I don’t faint. Luckily, though, the music was amazing and I got to enjoy the show even though I couldn’t see the stage. My headache somehow resolved by the encore, and I was able to stand, sing, and dance to Cigarette Daydreams and Come A Little Closer.
* **10:30 p.m.:** The Lions game (which we won!) and the concert ended at the same time, so we had to navigate through a stampede of people as we headed towards our parking spot. I told N I was craving ice cream, so we stopped at McDonald’s for an Oreo McFlurry (he pays) before we got back to his house. We chat about going ring shopping and planning for grad school. We say our goodbyes, and I head home for the night.

**Total: $20.14**

**Tuesday**

* **12:20 a.m.:** I go for the snack area as soon as I get home. I bring some food upstairs and play the Sims before my laptop dies. I start getting sleepy and decide to go to bed early so I can get more done throughout the day. I do my nightly unwind routine and go to sleep around 2.
* **10:30 a.m.**: My second alarm goes off, and I immediately watch a new Payday routine video. I realize that if I don’t get up now, though, I’m probably not going to do anything for a while. I’m still trying to figure out how I want to go about my days off. I’m just so used to having tasks with due dates throughout the week. I made a weekly cleaning schedule, and I try to do at least two things on my days off. I think I’ll do my floors, laundry, and surfaces today. I’ve been experimenting with going to the gym at different times, and I've tried going at 10 p.m., which I definitely don't enjoy. The gym’s a 20-minute drive from my house, which significantly reduces the likelihood of my wanting to go. It was much easier when it was a five to ten-minute drive from school and work.
* **11:30 a.m.:** The sun is out, and I’m trying to soak in and enjoy the vitamin D as I’m driving to the gym. I add more weight than normal while doing the hack squat. I might as well try to get stronger while I’m here lol!
* **12:50 p.m.:** I arrive home and bring our clean laundry bin upstairs to organize and fold once I get home from N’s. I take a quick shower and change into comfy clothes. I immediately take off my sheets to wash, so I’m not tempted to take a nap when I start feeling sleepy. I heat up leftover bacon carbonara and drink coffee.
* **1:30 p.m.:** I vacuum my floors & clean my bookshelves, desk, and vanity, much faster than I thought I would. I found a 1,000-piece puzzle from 2022. I worked on it for a little while, but had to put it away because of Thanksgiving. I contemplate getting a puzzle mat so that I can finally finish it. I might wait until I finish my 3-year anniversary scrapbook, which I was working on in my last money diary (I’m a year behind). I fold the laundry while watching the newest episode of Smosh Mouth.
* **3:45 p.m.:** I finish up the laundry, put my comforter in the wash, and leave for the nail salon. Rain’s pouring down, and all of the leaves hit my windshield as I exit the neighborhood; it actually feels like fall today. I catch up with my mom while getting a pedicure (she pays for mine). I always forget how much better my feet feel after (lol). N texts me and lets me know that I need to pick up his clothes and yoga mat, and just to meet him at the studio. Which works out better for me anyway, as I am in need of a snack!
* **5:45 p.m.:** N lets me know that he won’t take it to class today :/ I put his clothes in my empty bag and set up my mat. I hold most of my tension in my neck and lower back, so I loosen those up before class starts. It’s been a while since I went to a class, let alone an intermediate one, so I struggled a little more than normal. The class was the perfect amount of difficulty, though! I head back to N’s house and book the same class for next week. I paid $249 for a 20-class pack, so going to yoga will feel free for the next 5 or so months! My friend and I are planning a pilates and coffee date for next month. We agreed on a beginner-level class that I thought would be free, but it is not. I’ll probably still book the class tomorrow, though.
* **7:20 p.m.:** I get back to N’s house and watch Halloween Wars with his parents while waiting for him to come back from the gym. Once he gets back home, we eat dinner (chicken quesadillas) and watch Smosh Games videos. N has to travel to Kentucky for work early tomorrow, so I go home earlier than normal.
* **10:30 p.m.**: I get home and get my blankets out of the dryer. I take my morning medications (oops) and head upstairs. I change out of my yoga clothes and into my cozy pajamas. I haven’t been doing my monthly resets for the past few months and have been going with the flow. I’ve had a good few (and busy) months, which have been mainly focused on orientation. Now that I’m on my own and on nights, it’s really up to me to find ways to feel accomplished and have personal growth outside of work. I reflect on the past few months on my little notion template and plan how I want the rest of the year to go. I could try setting weight-lifting targets to reach by the end of the month/quarter or try out new meal prep ideas for work.

**Total: $0**

**Wednesday**

* **12:00 a.m.:** It’s pay day, and I check my paycheck to see if it’s accurate. Everything looks good! I lost my tweezers and ran out of printer paper for my Polaroid Hi-Print. I stare at my Amazon cart. I put the would-be purchase in my budget and see how I’d feel about having to move the money for the unplanned purchase (I use YNAB). I’m not planning on eating out or buying any random things for the rest of the month, so I moved the money to my hobby and beauty categories. I’m trying to let myself spend more money on things that improve my quality of life or help me save money in the long run. I ordered the printer paper **($35.30)** and Tweezerman tweezers **($13.04)**.
* **2:08 a.m.:** I’m getting sleepy now. I do my nightly skin care routine and go to sleep.
* **12:30 p.m.:** I toss and turn in bed and wonder why I feel weird. I finally open my eyes and check the time. Shit. I woke up 2 hours late. And my tummy hurts! I really wanted to get a lot done once I woke up, as I have to drive to work for a 1.5-hour simulation. And work is 40 minutes away (I really need to move). I change into my gym clothes and get ready for the day, but my stomach pain gets worse. I try to listen to my body when it tells me to slow down, so I do. I let myself rest for an extra 30 minutes. I get up and try to find our all-purpose cleaner, to no avail. I’ll try to do the counters and mirrors at a minimum once I get home. I shower in hopes that I’ll feel a little better afterwards, and luckily I do!
* **2:00 p.m.:** I eat breakfast and drink coffee. I blow-dry my hair and realize that I’ll need to buy myself a hair dryer once I move out (yikes!). I get ready for the day. I put on a stretchy rainbow headband and braid my hair. I budget my paycheck and reconcile my accounts before I head to work.
* **4:30 p.m.:** I leave the house and check my ETA. Oh no. My estimated arrival time is 5:25 p.m., and the class starts at 5:30 p.m. As I get closer, the more my ETA lengthens. Not only is there bad traffic, but there have also been several car accidents on the highways! I call the nurse educator to let her know I’ll be late. I park and I run upstairs to our classroom. Class goes by quickly. I place an order for Thai to pick up on my way home (my parents pay).
* **8:00 p.m.:** I unpack our takeout and start indulging in wing dings and shrimp Pad Thai. I text N to see if he still wants to watch Love Is Blind on Teleparty tonight. He calls once I get upstairs, and we catch up while figuring out how teleparty works. We watch the weddings and make a tier list of the 9 seasons. We say goodnight on the call.
* **11:00 p.m.:** I scroll on Reddit, mainly to enjoy all of the Love Is Blind discussion. I see a news article that SNAP benefits may be stopped due to the federal government shutdown. I read a few local articles to look for food assistance organizations. I donate to [Capuchin Soup Kitchen](https://www.cskdetroit.org/en/donate/monetary-donations/) **($55)**.

**Total: $103.34**

**Thursday**

* **2:00 a.m.:** I get anxious thinking about how I need to get back to the gym and start prioritizing my nutrition. I download a new strength training app (Hevy) and open an Umami account. I search for meal prep recipes. I don’t cook for myself, so I need to get the hang of it before I move out. I just hate using my parents' stuff and taking up space in the fridge. I also get stressed when I’m cooking. Maybe I just need to start doing it on my off-days. I listen to Smosh Reads Reddit stories.
* **4:30 a.m.:** I start to feel sleepy and do my nightly skincare routine. I go to sleep.
* **3:00 p.m.:** Wow! I slept for a long time again lol. I check my work email and finally get information about our nurse residency program. Starting in December, I’ll have to come into the hospital for a monthly seminar from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. That’s unfortunate. Will I be awake and alert? Probably not. I watch a couple of YouTube videos. N’s back from Kentucky already, and we FaceTime before I take a quick 20-minute power nap.
* **5:00 p.m.:** I get up and get ready for the night. I pack my leftover Pad Thai and snacks and eat breakfast. I take my medications and head to work.
* **6:55 p.m.:** I chill in the break room until it’s time to clock in. The unit is packed tonight. I'm assigned to our overflow unit with coworkers I get along with.
* **11:30 p.m.:** I wrap up most of my charting and head to lunch. We’ve had a lot of deliveries tonight, so I’ll be getting another room. At least I got most of my tasks done! My coworker made matcha lattes, and they are delicious. I munch on my lunch. I scroll through [Apartments.com](http://Apartments.com) to help a friend who wants to move out.

**Total: $0**

**Friday**

* **6:00 a.m.:** I get really busy at the end of the shift. It’s difficult having four moms and three babies without a patient care tech! I get everything done just in the nick of time. I give report and stay 20 minutes over to finish charting. I can’t wait to go to sleep.
* **8:30 a.m.:** I get home, take a shower, and go to sleep.
* **5:00 p.m.:** I get up and get ready for the day. My parents make me Spam, rice, and egg for breakfast! I eat  and drink coffee before heading out.
* **6:45 p.m.:** I’m the first night shifter in the break room. There’s a stack of six pizzas and some cookie-dough brownies on the table with no note or sign; that’s odd! I check and see if there’s anything left, and there is! Someone checks the last name on the receipt, and it’s from one of our patients. I feel less bad splitting a brownie. I sit through the team huddle and get report from the day shift. I plan my night out and realize that I’ll probably eat lunch later than normal. I grab a slice of cheese pizza before I get started.

**Total: $0**

**Saturday**

* **3:30 a.m.:** I'm really glad I ate that pizza, as I’ve been steadily busy all night. I finally heat up my spaghetti and catch up with a friend.
* **7:00 a.m.:** I wrap up all of my morning tasks, update my report sheets, & give report to the day shift nurse. I grab my stuff and head home.
* **8:15 a.m.:** I get home and take a long, hot shower before I head to bed. I have therapy appointments every other week on my weekends off. I made a silly little mistake and switched to the Friday shift as a favor to one of my coworkers. I could’ve cancelled this session, but I haven’t had an appointment in a month and thought it’d be worth getting a little less sleep to have an appointment. I set two alarms, a timer, and told my parents to wake me up at 10:50 if I’m not already up.
* **10:55 a.m.:** I actually was able to get up! I’m awake and alert enough to have a productive appointment (my parents pay). I sign off and get back to sleep. I text N to confirm our date tonight and to wake me up once he gets to the house.
* **3:00 p.m.:** N wakes me up and I get ready for date night. He’s looking to get a monthly calendar for his room and wants to eventually use it for our apartment. I agree to split the cost. It took forever to find one that fit our needs, but we found the perfect match at Office Depot and placed a pickup order **($20.19)**. We’re super excited and ready to move in together. We still have a little time before dinner, so we decide to finish up our Lego Bonsai Tree. I check my emails and tell N that I got an offer for cheap musical tickets. He agrees to get them. I booked the tickets **($29.25, my half)** and parking **($9.90, my half).**
* **6:00 p.m.:** We head out for dinner, and the restaurant is booked and busy tonight! I told N that I’ll pay because I really wanted to go to this restaurant. We walk around downtown until our table is ready. We munch on our unlimited chips and salsa while waiting to order. We eat my favorite chicken tenders on the entire planet and humongous mozzarella sticks for dinner **($36.80)**! We head home after being stuffed to the brim, all the while having plenty of leftovers.
* **8:30 p.m.:** Once we get home, I put on the newest episode of Smosh Reading Reddit Stories while N plays Balatro. I set out our homemade ice cream to thaw, and we cozy up to listen to creepy stories. N is getting sleepy, and we take a nap. We watch Shohei Ohtani highlights and say goodbye for the night.

**REFLECTION**  
  
I feel like this was a great spending week! I’m very in tune with my finances, so none of this is surprising to me. Now that I’m making big girl money, I’m spending more on things that I’ve been holding myself back from while I was in school. I sometimes worry about lifestyle inflation. However, I remind myself that I’m on track with my savings and investment goals and that the purpose of money is to be spent to create a life I love. I’m loving every little bit of this season where I’m making big girl money, but not having big girl expenses.  
  
I know it’s not reflected in this diary, but I’ve been trying to spend as much quality time with family before I move out. It’s been fun treating my parents to experiences and meals out as little tokens of gratitude for everything they’ve done for me!  
  
It’s been difficult coordinating frequent friend time, as most of my friends are also nurses, but I plan at least one group activity every month and solo time with my close friends. I’m excited to get closer with my night shift girlies and get to know each other outside of work.  
  
My life’s going to change a lot in the next year, with moving out, getting engaged (?), and possibly combining finances, but I know that I’ll have a lot of love and support along the way!",12,1761492917.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,4,1.0,False

1ognmjn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ognmjn,New 4 Ingredient Packaging Feels Like a Bait and Switch,"We love the Chilled Low Fat Oatly and use it for lattes, straight up, cereal, cooking and baking, etc. 

When the Super Basic version came out, we loved the clean ingredients list, but unfortunately there is an acrid taste with coffee (maybe from the citrus fibers) and it didn't work for us. So we went back to the Low Fat. 

It looks like Oatly has decided on a packaging change/rebranding for Super Basic. The wild part to me is that it looks nearly identical to the Low Fat. Was this intentional? 

Our local Wegman's store unknowingly mixed both 4 Ingredient and Low Fat in the same slot, so we ended up purchasing two cartons of the 4 Ingredient that have to be returned now. We don't blame the stockers one bit because as you can see from the photos, the packaging is nearly identical. The old ""Super Basic"" packaging had yellow lettering and accents that brought attention to the fact that it was a different product, but this time it feels like a bait-and-switch. 

Is Oatly trying to trick people into trying the 4 Ingredient? It's not good, and I think this method won't go over well and may turn people away from Oatly altogether. ",1,1761492862.0,Oatly,0,0.67,False

1ognllh,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ognllh/22m_lost_all_content_happiness_in_life/,[22m] Lost all content happiness in life,"Hi guys, this is going to be pretty long — if anyone wants the short version, read the TL;DR.

For a very long time now, almost 7 years, I have never felt truly happy or content with life.

This started when I was 16 years old, around the time COVID happened. I tried using social media back then, but it constantly stressed me out because I was obese and often made fun of in school. However, it didn’t completely stop me from being happy — I still loved going to parties, celebrating birthdays, and all that. After some time, I removed social media completely and now only use Reddit.

My family is very good and supportive, but they’re also very busy making ends meet. I myself have been earning since childhood.

Currently, I’m a software engineer and have a good job, but I’m still never able to feel even a single sliver of happiness. It’s at such a dangerous level that I almost feel jealous of other people’s joy — not in a bad or hateful way, just in a “why couldn’t I have that?” kind of way.

I also loved a girl for almost 6 years, but that never worked out because of my weight and short height. This led me to develop an addiction to masturbation, which is still an ongoing problem. I don’t do drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes though.

I’ve improved myself by losing weight, even though I’m still short. But to add fuel to the fire, my hair started thinning as soon as I started getting in good shape.

Throughout my life, I had several friends in school and college, but since I don’t use social media much, almost all of them are either gone or too busy with their own lives to even meet for a coffee or lunch. Honestly, they could also be avoiding me — I’m not sure.

All my relatives are jealous of my job because no one in my family has studied this much, and my parents used 90 percent of their life savings for my degree.

I don’t like doctors or medicines at all, so I’ve never sought professional mental help.

Honestly, I never dreamed my life would turn out this way. I’m not in any crisis right now — I still smile — but it feels fake.

I need some advice on how to get my contentment back, if that’s even possible.


---

TL;DR:

I’ve been unhappy for about 7 years, ever since COVID and high school. I struggled with weight, rejection, and loneliness, quit social media, and though I now have a stable software job, I still feel no real happiness or contentment. I lost weight but started losing hair, most friends have drifted away, and I’ve never sought therapy because I dislike doctors. My life looks fine from outside, but inside I feel empty and fake.

I was supposed to be a ghost. The first love, the one enshrined in memory, the wife who died too young.

Ten years after the fire, a System brought me back.

My mission: to save him, the villain my husband had become.

The only problem? I couldn't remember a thing. Not him, not our life, not even my own name until the System gave it to me.

So when I saw him from a distance, a man carved from shadow and ice, I didn’t get close.

His security saw to that.

As they threw me against the alley wall, the world spitting me out like something bitter, a series of comments flickered into existence before my eyes, a ghostly feed only I could see.

【Here we go again. I’ve lost count of how many have tried to ‘save’ the big bad wolf.】

【For a decade, the System has been terrified he’ll burn the world down. So it keeps sending these candidates, these replacements, to try and pacify him.】

【There have been girls who looked just like his dead wife, girls who had her exact personality, even one who came armed with all of her memories…】

【They all failed. Spectacularly.】

【So this one? This painfully average girl? How many days does she get?】

1

When the System dropped me into this life, the man whose moods dictated the stability of the entire world was thirty-four years old. And he had a son who was nearly ten.

I woke from a long, dreamless sleep into a world of total unknowns.

All I knew was my name—Nora. I was twenty-three. The System had just informed me of this. Beyond that, it gave me a litany of warnings, a thousand cautions about the man I was supposed to save. It urged me not to end up like the others who came before me, who had their lives extinguished the moment they entered his world.

The System told me his name was Damian Shaw, a man who sat at the absolute apex of global wealth and power.

He was brutal, vindictive, a caged animal pacing the confines of his own gilded world. The only shred of humanity he had left, it seemed, was reserved for his young son.

I stared at my reflection in the mirror for a long time.

“I don’t see anything special in me,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “Nothing that would make a man like that even look my way.”

The System was silent for a moment.

When it spoke again, its tone was heavy with meaning. “You’re the last chance, Nora. If you can’t do this—”

It cut itself off, the voice hardening with a strange resolve. “No. You can. You have to.”

2

The System’s warnings were not an exaggeration.

The first time I managed to even get a glimpse of Damian Shaw, I was detected almost instantly.

He was standing outside the gates of an expensive-looking private school, waiting for his son. He wore a tailored black coat, the collar turned up against the wind, his frame a stark silhouette against the pale afternoon sky.

He never once glanced in my direction.

I watched the sharp, cold line of his profile, and a strange, uncontrollable emotion bloomed in my chest. It was a grief so sharp, so sudden, it brought tears to my eyes.

The feeling stunned me, rooting me to the spot. I didn't even notice his security approaching until they were on me—two mountains in bespoke suits.

A universe of pain erupted as they heaved me into the brick wall of a nearby alley. One of them, his face a mask of professional menace, leaned down.

“You don’t look at people you’re not supposed to see,” he growled, the threat hanging in the cold air.

He gave my pathetic, crumpled form on the ground a final, dismissive glance.

“Next time, it won’t be this simple.”

3

At that exact moment, the sky began to bleed snow.

I cradled my throbbing arm, leaning against the cold brick. From the mouth of the alley, I watched Damian greet his son. Even with the boy, his expression didn't soften. He just stubbed out his cigarette, his movements precise and economical, and reached down to take the small hand offered to him.

They turned and walked to a black car waiting at the curb.

Maybe my stare was too intense, too desperate. Just before he got in, the boy turned his head and looked directly at me.

I must have been a sorry sight, a mess of snow and blood and bruised dignity.

And yet, instinctively, I managed a small, gentle smile for this beautiful, serious-looking boy.

His gaze was as indifferent as his father’s. His eyes, a deep, quiet gray, assessed me calmly.

He only looked for a second.

A bodyguard stepped forward, pulling the car door open. It closed with a solid, final thud, sealing them inside. The car pulled away from the curb without a backward glance.

4

My heart plummeted, a sudden, sickening feeling of freefall.

Before I could even begin to process the strange tide of emotions washing over me, the white text reappeared, scrolling rapidly in my vision.

【A new player has entered the game.】

【Ten years. I’ve lost count of how many there have been. Dozens? Hundreds?】

【The System is so damn scared of this guy. Terrified he’s gonna have one bad day and just delete the whole world.】

【So it keeps trying to shove people into his life.】

【But Damian only loves his dead wife.】

【That’s why the System keeps sending these ‘substitutes.’】

【Some look like her, some act like her, one even had a complete memory download…】

5

I stared at the frantic stream of text, my brow furrowed. I’d forgotten how to blink.

“This guy,” as they called him, had to be Damian Shaw, the man holding the world hostage with his grief.

And the failed players… that’s why the System had been so insistent on his danger. It had tried everything.

Which begged the question: why did it think I, someone so painfully ordinary, could possibly succeed where all the others had failed?

As if reading my mind, the feed’s commentary shifted to me.

【Honestly, though, it’s not some substitute player who’s been keeping him stable all these years.】

【It’s the son his wife left him.】

【She was gone, just like that. Nothing left of her but that boy.】

【That kid is Damian’s only remaining tether to this world.】

【If it weren't for him, Damian probably would’ve destroyed everything, himself included, years ago. He would have followed his wife into the grave.】

【Which is why every single one of these players has failed.】

【His wife is his ghost, his sacred ground.】

【It’s the one pure thing left in his heart.】

【He will not let anyone defile her memory by wearing her face or claiming her place.】

【That’s why the fakes all die. Each one worse than the last.】

【So what about this one?】

【This plain, unprepared girl with absolutely nothing going for her?】

【How many days do you give her?】

A betting pool started.

【I give her until the next time she meets him.】

【That’s when she dies. I’m in.】

【I’ll take that bet.】

【Same.】

Then, a laughing emoji appeared.

【Dude, she took a pretty nasty fall just now.】

【And it’s snowing. Hard.】

【Who’s to say she even survives the night…?】

6

I lowered my gaze, ignoring the cascade of cruel text. I focused on the bloody scrape on my arm instead.

But, to everyone’s surprise, my next interaction with the world of Damian Shaw came not from me, but from his son.

He came to me.

I have no idea how he found me. I only know that when I opened the door of my room in the cheap motel I could barely afford, he was standing there, a backpack slung over his shoulder, alone.

He had his father’s face in miniature, the same serious, impassive expression.

I froze in the doorway.

He tilted his head back slightly to look up at me, his gaze fixed on my face.

“Who are you?” he asked, his voice low and clear.

It was a strange question. He had sought me out, only to ask who I was.

“My name is Nora,” I answered, my voice steady despite my confusion.

The instant the name left my lips, his brow tightened into a deep frown.

7

The white text in my vision never stopped. As I spoke, it erupted in a chorus of unified mockery.

【Has the System just given up?】

【It’s tried look-alikes.】

【It’s tried act-alikes.】

【This is the first time it’s been this blatant. Just dropped in a player with the exact same name.】

【The System really isn’t afraid of making him angry, is it?】

【It might as well just gift-wrap her, drop her on his desk, and say: ‘You wanted Nora? Here’s a Nora for you.’】

Unlike the boisterous feed, the boy in front of me was dead serious.

“My name is Liam,” he said quietly.

His gaze intensified, studying my face, waiting for a reaction I didn't know how to give.

Nora. Liam.

His name felt… connected to mine somehow. And combined with what the feed had revealed…

Perhaps Damian Shaw’s dead wife, his ghost, was named Nora.

8

But my mind was a perfect, silent blank.

I couldn't give Liam the reaction he was clearly looking for. I had nothing to give.

The hopeful intensity in his eyes slowly cooled into a familiar indifference.

Just then, a man in a tailored suit came hurrying down the hall from the elevators. He was a head taller than Liam, but he stopped before the boy and bowed his head respectfully.

“Young master,” he said, his tone urgent. “The car is waiting downstairs. You’ll be late for school.”

Liam’s dark lashes lowered for a moment. It looked like disappointment.

He turned to leave, his movements sharp and decisive. But after a single step, he paused. He frowned again, looking not at me, but at the grimy glass of the hallway window opposite my door.

“You should get those injuries looked at,” he said.

I followed his gaze to the window and saw my reflection. The crude bandages wrapped around my arm and right leg. The System hadn't given me any advantages, no magical starting funds. The little cash I had was barely enough for this motel room and cheap food. A hospital was a luxury I couldn't imagine.

Liam was already gone.

My eyes lingered on the window, on the blurry, distorted image of my own face.

9

There was a mottled scar on my right cheek.

The System said I died in a fire ten years ago. It drew its energy from the world it managed, but Damian Shaw was a man who repaid every debt, real or imagined, a thousand times over. His wife had died in an ""accident"" connected to the world's original hero and heroine. So he had, without mercy, destroyed everyone involved.

That hero and heroine, the world’s designated protagonists, had been dead for five years.

With them gone, the world had fallen completely under Damian’s control. The System itself was barely surviving, starved for power. It had only managed to restore my body to about 80% of its original state. I was healthy, but my skin was a roadmap of faded and raised burn scars of varying sizes.

I looked at the strange face in the glass. It was a plain face, made ugly by the scar.

Choosing me, this version of me, to win over a man like Damian…

I couldn't see a single glimmer of hope. No wonder the feed was filled with nothing but laughter at my expense.

10

Hope or no hope, I still had a mission.

I had to win him over. That was the purpose of my resurrection, and the only way I was allowed to keep living.

But before I could even think about Damian Shaw, I had to solve the immediate problem of my own survival.

After days of searching, I found a job as a night-shift stocker at a bookstore in the lobby of the building directly across from Shaw Corp headquarters.

My shift ended at midnight. The tower opposite was still blazing with light.

I sat on the steps outside the bookstore, opening a box of cold takeout.

At 12:07 AM, Damian’s black Maybach swept past. The tinted windows were impenetrable, a wall of black glass.

I knew he was in there. The white text was buzzing with commentary. It seemed they had a better view than I did, a camera inside the car itself, and they used it to continue their running critique of me.

【Looks like the System gave up and now the player has given up, too…】

【Every other candidate who came here was immediately scheming, trying to get in front of him, trying to find an angle.】

【Her? She’s casually getting a job and living her life.】

【Guess that first meeting with his security guards scared her straight, huh?】

【Am I really just supposed to sit here and watch her organize bookshelves every night?】

【If you’re this useless, you shouldn’t have taken the mission from the System in the first place…】

I dropped my gaze, tuning out the hostile words. That’s when I noticed a stray dog, tail wagging hopefully, nosing at my leg.

I picked out the only two pieces of meat from my meal and gave them to him. We shared the rest of my cold dinner under the city lights.

11

I worked at the bookstore for nearly a month. My injuries had mostly healed.

It was then that I saw Damian again, by accident.

It was 11 PM, and my boss asked me to deliver a stack of specially ordered books to an office in the tower across the street. After clearing multiple security checkpoints, I finally set foot inside the monolithic building for the first time.

I dropped off the books and was heading back to the elevators. The building was quiet at this hour, most of the floors dark. As I waited, I heard a faint sound from the end of the long, empty corridor.

It sounded like someone trying to choke back a cry of extreme pain.

The elevator was taking forever.

I hesitated, then looked toward the end of the hall.

The feed screamed at me not to get involved, to mind my own business. They were even giving me strategic advice: use this chance to sneak down to the parking garage and ambush Damian when he left for the night.

But I could still hear that muffled, desperate sound.

I stood there for a long moment, then turned and walked toward the sound.

12

I don’t think anyone could have expected who I found.

Crouched on the floor of the starkly lit emergency stairwell landing, it was Damian Shaw.

He was dressed in a crisp black shirt and trousers, his shoulders broad even when he was curled in on himself. It was a picture of profound, shocking vulnerability.

The moment I pushed the heavy door open, his head snapped up. His eyes were alert, sharp with suspicion and pain. Sweat beaded on his temples.

I had stumbled into something I was never meant to see.

I froze, my hand still on the door. Trapped in his gaze, I forced myself to speak. “…Do you need me to call a doctor?”

He just stared at me, his expression cold and unreadable.

I instinctively raised a hand to my face, pressing the plain white mask I wore more securely against my skin. Because of the scar, I always wore one in public, afraid of frightening customers or children.

The weight of his stare was immense. I wanted to back away, to disappear.

But then I saw the vein throbbing at his temple, the bloodless press of his lips, and a strange, unwelcome wave of empathy washed over me.

I took a step forward and pulled a small bottle of painkillers from my pocket. I’d never seen a doctor for the injuries his men had given me. When the pain was unbearable, I’d just chewed one of these and waited for it to pass.

It seemed the cheap pills I kept in my bag finally had a use.

13

Under his relentless gaze, I placed a single pill on the cool concrete beside him.

I turned to leave, but his hand shot out and clamped around my wrist. His grip was ice-cold, the chill seeping straight into my bones.

I had no choice but to look down at him. Our eyes met, the distance between us suddenly gone.

“Who are you?” he finally asked, his voice a raw rasp.

The light was dim, but I saw something flicker in the depths of his black eyes, a ghost of a reflection that was there and then gone.

He moved too fast for me to react. Before I could protest, his other hand came up and hooked the elastic of my mask, pulling it down.

His dark pupils reflected the stark geography of the scar on my face.

We were so close.

I saw his eyes… tremble. Just for a fraction of a second.

This face of mine. It was still a shock.

I reached up, pulling the mask back into place. As I did, I saw his hand fall open slightly, as if from a sudden loss of strength. A silver chain spilled from his palm.

It was what he had been clutching so tightly.

A silver locket.

I could just make out the faded, smiling face of a young woman etched onto its surface.

I pulled my gaze away. I left the pill and walked away.

This time, he didn't stop me.

At the door, I glanced back one last time. He was still sitting there, a figure of absolute black in the sterile white light.

A monument to ruin.

14

The white text was criticizing me again. They called me an idiot, hopeless.

【I’m done…】

【She is officially the most useless player I have ever seen.】

【She just stumbled onto a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, a total stroke of luck, and she didn’t even know how to use it?】

【She just walked away?】

【Shouldn’t she have stayed? Comforted him? Shown some concern?】

【She finally gets a moment alone with him and she just LEAVES?】

【WHAT IS SHE EVEN DOING?】

Some of them were even more vulgar, suggesting I should have thrown myself into his arms, used the oldest tricks in the book to seduce him.

They were convinced I was a lost cause anyway. A person like me could never complete the mission. They were practically begging for me to do something stupid, to provoke Damian and get myself killed so they could move on.

They didn’t want to watch my story anymore.

If I died, a new, more competent player would take my place.

15

The bookstore owner signed a long-term contract with a client in the Shaw Corp tower. I started volunteering for the delivery runs.

Occasionally, I would catch a glimpse of Damian from a distance.

He was always in black, not a hint of color on him, save for the occasional flash of a white shirt collar at his throat. He moved with a relentless purpose, a coterie of suited subordinates trailing in his wake, their heads bowed. In public, he was the cold, unapproachable king. There was no trace of the pale, vulnerable man from the stairwell.

Sometimes, passing by the break rooms, I’d overhear employees gossiping. They said the terrifying CEO’s office was a black hole of color. No fresh flowers, no art, just oppressive shades of gray and black.

The story of Damian’s dead wife was an open secret in the company. Maybe it was because his son was a frequent visitor. Or maybe it was because of the simple, plain wedding band he wore, a ring that was never, ever removed.

They whispered that he was living like a monk, that he was keeping himself pure in her memory.

I clutched a heavy stack of books to my chest and walked silently through the crowds of bright, successful people.

For the first time, I began to seriously question whether agreeing to this mission had been a mistake.

16

I’d been in this world for over two months.

Everything I learned pointed to one fact: Damian Shaw had loved his wife with a terrifying, all-consuming devotion. No wonder so many players had come and gone, all of them failures.

The chances of my success were zero.

Even the white text seemed to have accepted my incompetence. They barely bothered to insult me anymore.

It felt like my very existence was a desecration of the love between Damian and his dead wife.

I had no past. And it seemed I had no future, either.

Should I even continue with this hopeless mission?

I was lost in thought, the tall stack of books in my arms obscuring my view. I didn't see the woman in the crisp white suit, a coffee cup in her hand, until I walked right into her.

Coffee splashed across the books and, more damningly, all over the front of her pristine white jacket.

I immediately started trying to wipe the books, apologizing profusely.

The woman’s voice was sharp. She grabbed my arm. “Who let you in here?”

I explained I was from the bookstore downstairs.

She let out a cold laugh. “I wasn’t aware this company was in the habit of collaborating with some shabby little bookstore.”

17

More and more people were turning to stare.

I kept my head down, repeating my apologies. “Your jacket… I can have it cleaned for you. Or, I can pay for a new one.”

“Can you afford it?” she sneered, looking me up and down.

Her fingernails were long and sharp. With a flick of her wrist, she hooked my mask and pulled it away from my face.

It fluttered to the ground. My face was exposed to everyone.

I heard a collective gasp from the onlookers behind me.

“You…” The beautiful woman’s voice trailed off, her eyes wide.

I closed my eyes for a brief second. Then I bent down, picked up the mask, and put it back on, hiding my shame.

“I’m sorry,” I said, bowing my head again. “Whatever you think is fair, I’ll accept it.”

The entire floor was silent.

And in that silence, an elevator chimed, a crisp, clear ding.

The doors slid open. A man stepped out. His tall frame cast a long shadow that fell right at my feet.

18

“I’m the one who signed the contract with their bookstore.”

Damian’s voice was low and cool, devoid of any warmth. The moment he spoke, every head in the vicinity bowed.

The white text reacted even faster than I did.

My vision was flooded, a blizzard of white. This time, the message was simple and uniform.

Question marks. A screen full of question marks.

【Did I miss an episode?】

【I’ve been watching this whole time, I haven’t been gone, can someone PLEASE tell me what is happening right now?】

【Damian… bro… why did you suddenly show up?】

【Wait… I’ve had my eyes on this girl 24/7. Is it possible she did something I don’t know about?】

I slowly looked up. Damian’s polished black shoes were stopped right in front of me.

A cool touch on my wrist. Damian had taken hold of it. His grip was firm, a silent command that allowed for no resistance.

I didn’t dare try to pull away. I couldn't have, even if I wanted to. My hand went limp, and the stack of books I was holding tumbled to the floor.

I turned my head and met his gaze.

He was looking down, his dark eyes fixed on mine, seeing something deep inside me. But just as I tried to read the emotion there, he subtly shifted his gaze away.

“Same as always,” he murmured, his words meant only for me. “No improvement at all.”

Despite the criticism, the hand holding my wrist didn't loosen in the slightest.

19

With Damian’s arrival, the entire situation inverted itself.

The System, the feed—they had all described his terrifying nature to me. But this was the first time I had witnessed his cold, absolute power firsthand.

He didn't listen to a single word of the woman's stammered explanation.

He simply raised a hand, a slight, dismissive gesture. Two of his security guards appeared as if from nowhere and dragged the woman away.

No one dared to object. No one even dared to look up.

The man in front of me was a dangerous enigma.

I watched the woman disappear down the hall, then slowly looked up at Damian. A strange, inexplicable smile was playing on his lips.

It was directed at me.

His thumb began to gently stroke the inside of my wrist.

He leaned in slightly. “I just took care of that for you,” he said, his voice a low murmur. He then asked, his tone deceptively casual, “How are you going to thank me?”",1,1761492761.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

admiration of Jane Roberts, and it surprises me that so many have joined us in the last year. Notice
that this subreddit is not called ""seth"" or some such. I dedicated it to Jane and her extraordinary life.

I no longer find it enjoyable. As it has grown, it inevitably brought back all the ""trappings"" of
local/online meetups that I walked away from, and so I have mostly retracted myself from this subreddit.
As I deleted all of my posts, a relief washed over me, and I knew this was the correct decision.
But I do feel that I should provide some degree of explanation.

I am tired of upsetting people with my sometimes caustic commentary, and I am truly sorry for those

I do not like coming into Reddit in the morning to see complaints in my inbox. It gives me no joy.
I am not Seth, and I do not have the ""authority"" of one who is consciously aware of their existence within
inner reality. I can only provide my interpretation, and as this subreddit grows, there is the inevitable
growth of confrontation, and I don't enjoy it. I never entered into reading the Seth material only
to argue with people about it. That is pointless.

As the administrator, I can see that the traffic falls to a trickle without my commentary.
That is just the fact.

And so what should I do?

We are all on a journey ultimately set in motion by ""All That Is""'s divine subjectivity. My thoughts on
the matter are ultimately irrelevant, just as I think Rob's notes do more harm than good by getting
in the way of reading the Seth material.

And so the compromise I have arrived at is to post interesting quotes I come across without interpretation
as I continue to leap across sessions in search of greater understanding. I will lock these quotes
down so that I do not get replies in my inbox because I do not want them.

When I add a new quote, the prior quote will be deleted. And so will this one-time message disappear
along with the first deletion.

Know only that there are people on this planet who dedicate large portions of their time to pondering
the mysteries of existence through the lens of the Seth Material. And it is my hope that our society
will overcome its greed and lack of empathy to one day come to understand the innate wisdom of our inner identity.

**SESSION 884: Wednesday, October 3, 1979**

*We are sitting here on a specific autumn evening. I am obviously dictating this book, speaking through 
Ruburt, while Joseph sits on the couch across from a very specific coffee table, taking down my words. 
This is the year 1979, and the idea of time and of dates seems to be indelibly mixed into everyone's 
psychology. You can remember last year, and to some extent recall the past years of your lives. It 
appears to you that your present consciousness wanders backward into the past, until finally you can 
remember no longer—and on a conscious level, at least, you must take the very event of your birth 
under secondhanded evidence. Few people have conscious memory of it.*

*For the purposes of our discussion, I must necessarily couch this book to some degree in the framework 
of time. I must honor your specifics. Otherwise you would not understand what I am trying to say. 
Even though this book is being dictated within time's tradition, therefore, I must remind you that 
basically that tradition is not mine—and more, basically, it is not yours either.*

*I used the term ""before the beginning,"" then, and I will speak of earth's events in certain sequences. 
In the deepest of terms, however, and in ways that quite scandalize the intellect when it tries to 
operate alone, the beginning is now. That critical explosion of divine subjectivity into objectivity 
is always happening, and you are being given life ""in each moment"" because of the simultaneous nature 
of that divine subjectivity.*",3,1761492581.0,janeroberts,0,1.0,False

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv.

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly not showing too much off with revealing clothing. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1ognej5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1ognej5/anger_a_tired_day/,"Anger, a tired day","Last night I was so angry my stomach twisted and I vomited up everything I’d eaten that day. Like that horrible few weeks last spring, when the only thing I could hold down were protein bars and coffee, too dense and mealy to bring back up even when I retched. Today I am drained and unhappy, like how alcoholics describe the day after a binge. I ate some salt, helps with the shaking and uncontrollable need to urinate. But I am still so unhappy. The taste of bile is the taste of desperation.

My father thinks I am bitter as a temperamental disorder. But he thinks that because he is privileged, and didn’t see much of me when I was growing up. He is tall and handsome and speaks well, people often try to take advantage of his good nature, but they want to impress him so they act well in front of him. I am bitter by temperament maybe, but also because this is the way the world shaped me. He doesn’t notice how I can go into a room and everyone talks above my head like I am a dog. The disgust of the busy people at my incompetence. The unease at my jerky movements and garbled speech. He thinks, if he notices at all, that they act this way because I duck my head and retreat. But he never saw, how I raged as a kid, and my life got worse. It is better to comply and be tolerated, than to insist upon myself and be ostracized. 

I wonder, if you think this too. I can feel  your frustration with me sometimes, at my hesitancy to speak and act, my tendency to ruminate violently. But my father is an eternal optimist, he believes fully in the goodness of humanity. You told me yourself, you are not. From the first time I met you, I thought that you must have suffered terribly at one point. You are too kind and observant, not to have. You told me about your son. Your voice to him on the phone was like your voice to me, when I knocked on your door, pale and sweating, to ask if my duo partner and I could rehearse in your room that afternoon. It was during those two weeks last spring, and all my memories are recorded frenetically from then, like someone was trying to hold the camera steady after drinking a gallon of coffee. I wonder if his life is like mine was, at that age. I want to reassure you, don’t worry, he won’t end up like me. A lot of other things went wrong, to make me end up like this.

Part of me thinks, no one who actually spends time with kids could think well of humanity. We are all terrible, how I hate us all. Everyone only acts good when they remember to, most of the time, they do what they want. Mostly the only people who really try to be good are a few who were beaten mercilessly by the world. Maybe a few exceptions, my sister, who looked after us when our parents were away, my duo partner, who yelled at the security guards who were openly disgusted with me. They are both eldest sisters of an Asian family, I suppose the world is hardest on them. You try, you are very rigorous in your trying. That is one of the reasons I love you.

I don’t really try anymore. Or I try by avoidance. When I really tried to be good, people didn’t see me as a person. They felt they were free to act however they felt around me, so I saw so much of their ugliness, I became bitter. Last week, I felt something big was about to happen. Usually when I get that feeling, it is something bad. It turned out, it was possibly something good, but I cannot help assuming it will turn into something bad. What are the good things in my life? They are all small, things that really didn’t change anything. You smiling, the flash of your hands across the keyboard. My father bought me lunch and there was both broccoli and cauliflower that day. My duo partner joking about sonatas. My friend in Germany, his nose pressed against my ear. Every momentous and sudden change of my life has been for the worse, like a marble rolling down a terraced steppe. I think I am used to one level, that I can acclimate to it, and then the stone beneath me drops out again. I can’t imagine a change that would be good.

I wrote to you a series of jumbled emails because I was panicking. And then scolded myself, why am I bothering you? What can he do? I guess, I just wanted to let you know. I am afraid, that you are disgusted. This change, if it is good, should go to someone more deserving. I am afraid, it will end up being bad, and ruin me. I am afraid, that it is actually nothing, and my life will continue terracing downwards. I am afraid, if I didn’t tell you, so many bad things would happen before you get back, that you would be blindsided again. Good people do exist, you told me, but you have to go out and find them. I don’t know though, if you get one carrot for every 50 lashes of the whip, there doesn’t feel much point in going out to see the world. 

I saw Frankenstein last night, the scientist told the monster, if you are forced to live, then live. But that is easy for him to say. Sit in the sun, listen to Beethoven, what’s the point in rushing it? That is what you told me. It was the kindest thing anyone has ever said to me. The monster in the movie had the deer who ate leaves out of his hand, the girl who touched his face, the old man in the cabin, the feeling of the sun on his skin. What do I have? I guess also these small things. So many of them are interwoven with you. I suppose the only thing to do is move forward. I can’t expect anything to change. But if my life devolves into something worse and worse, I’ll always have the image of you smiling. Sometimes you have to make the small things be enough.",2,1761492334.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

* 🥇 **Juice** leads with $19,157 in total sales.
* Salad, Sandwich, Smoothie, and Cake complete the top 5, together generating **the majority of revenue**.
* Lower performers: Coffee, Tea, and Cookie.

📊 **Insight:**

* The top 5 products dominate sales, indicating a **strong core product lineup**.

# 🏪 2. Channel Performance (Location)

* **Takeaway sales**: $62,182.50 (≈ 70% of total revenue).
* **In-store sales**: $27,174.00.

**Average transaction value**:

* In-store: $9.01
* Takeaway: $8.90

📊 **Insight:**

* Takeaway clearly drives **volume**, but in-store brings slightly **higher ticket value**.
* This suggests that dine-in customers are more likely to **buy premium or multiple items**, possibly desserts or drinks.

**💡 Suggestion:**

* Consider **promotions or upselling at takeaway**, e.g., “add a cookie for $1” to lift the average transaction value.
* Enhance **in-store experience** to retain high-value customers (loyalty program, combo deals, seasonal specials).

# 💳 3. Payment Method Trends

* **Digital Wallet** dominates with 5,469 transactions (54.7%).
* Credit Card and Cash are roughly equal at \~2,260 transactions each.

📊 **Insight:**

* The preference for digital wallet indicates a **tech-savvy customer base**.
* Faster checkout options may enhance customer experience further.

**💡 Suggestion:**

* Offer **exclusive digital payment incentives** (e.g., 5% cashback for digital wallet payments).
* Make sure the POS system is optimized for digital-first customers.

# 🍰 4. Strategic Opportunities

* **Bundling & Upselling:** Boost underperforming items like cookies and tea through add-ons or combos.
* **Takeaway Revenue Optimization:** Even a **small increase in average spend** can yield significant growth due to high volume.

Picture this: 54M here, eight years deep in what felt like the real deal. Shared everything, from late-night dreams to daily chaos. Then she drifted—texts slowed, hugs felt forced—and one quiet evening, it ended. No blowout, no cheating, just ""I don't feel it anymore."" I chased hard: Pleading calls, ""let's fix this"" pleas. 

Crickets. Spiraled for months, replaying every ""what if."" Sound familiar? That ache where hope and hurt tangle? I know it too well.

But here's the shift that saved me: Full no-contact, not as punishment, but as a promise to myself. No peeks, no ""just checking."" Brutal first 60 days—nights hit like waves, doubts screamed loud. Then, something cracked open. 

I started small, filling the quiet with me. Coached a 32M buddy through his two-year dump last month; he borrowed these steps and messaged me yesterday: ""Man, she's reaching out now—and I'm okay either way."" Not magic, but real. If you're in the trenches, these pulled me from fog to footing. Simple, honest, no tricks.

Block and Breathe: Cut all lines—phone, socials, mutuals. Day one feels like air's gone, but by week two, your head quiets. Use the space for one ""me walk"" daily—no phone, just steps. It grounded me when memories ambushed.

Journal the Layers: 10 minutes nightly: What hurt today? What strength showed up? No judgment. I wrote ""her laugh lit me up"" next to ""my silence pushed her away."" Patterns emerged—mine, not just hers.

 Buddy did it; stopped the blame game cold.
Fill with Fire: Pick one thing that scares you a bit—gym class, new book club, solo coffee run. I tried woodworking; hands busy, heart eased. Builds the you she'd notice, but really, it's for your quiet wins.

Gratitude Anchor: End days with three ""today's goods"" (good meal? Kind stranger?). Sounds soft, but it flips ""lost her"" to ""found me."" Research backs it—healing speeds up 25 percent with this habit.

Vision the Horizon: Picture six months out—stronger laugh, new trail buddy. I sketched mine; turned ""stuck"" to ""stepping."" Friend visualized ""easy love""—landed a date that felt right.

Pain's the teacher we didn't ask for, but damn if it doesn't forge something fierce. You're not broken; you're mid-build. That ""want her back"" pull? Let it fuel growth, not chase. One day, you'll look back grateful for the quiet that grew you.

Guys and gals, what's the one no-contact hack that cracked your fog open? Spill below—let's swap stories and lift the load.
TL;DR: 54M after 8-year drift breakup shares 5 no-contact steps: Block breathe, journal layers, fill fire, gratitude anchor, vision horizon. Helped a friend reconnect.

 Your hack?

1ogn9n8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1ogn9n8/thoughts_on_southern_maine/,Thoughts on southern Maine?,"Specifically looking at Biddeford! A little background:

I (33F) grew up in a tiny, very rural town in the Missouri Ozarks. Moved to Nashville for college and never left. I’ve been here for almost 16 years. There are some things about Nashville I love (the nature, good coffee culture, artsy people, some family and friends) but I have seasonal affective disorder in the summer, and the summers here are only getting longer and more brutal. At this point I’m hibernating half the year because I can’t deal with the heat. Sometimes the sun is too much and I feel alive when it’s cool/cold and cloudy.

I work remotely making around 100k, and I’m pretty frugal. My hobbies are going on walks, drinking coffee, going to church, game nights, that sort of thing. I also already own a Subaru lol

My sister and I visited Maine a couple years ago and both fell in love. I know it’s a very expensive place to live, but recently I found a cute apartment in Biddeford and it got me seriously considering a move. Close to Portland, coffee shops, cute little down town, only 1.5 hours to Boston (bonus since I do need to fly to Philly for work several times a year), close to the beach. My friend who lives in southern Maine says it’s a very up-and-coming area.

Does anyone familiar with the area think this could be a good fit for me? My sister would probably move up to wherever I end up within a few years. It’s hard to balance wanting to be somewhere better weather wise for my mental health vs leaving behind the support system I have here in Nashville. ",4,1761491998.0,SameGrassButGreener,2,1.0,False

1ogn8ms,https://www.reddit.com/r/terrifying/comments/1ogn8ms/the_coffee_spill_that_changed_everything/,The Coffee Spill That Changed Everything,"It was one of those grey Monday mornings when even the coffee tasted tired. Maya had overslept again, her alarm drowned out by the hum of the ceiling fan and the rhythm of rain outside. By the time she stumbled into the café near her office, she already knew she’d be late for the meeting she wasn’t supposed to miss. She ordered her usual, a large caramel latte and as fate would have it, the barista was new.

When the coffee arrived, Maya grabbed it too quickly, juggling her phone, laptop bag, and umbrella all at once. The cup slipped. A splash of caramel latte hit her shirt, her phone, and unfortunately, a stranger’s blazer. The man turned sharply, and Maya froze. She expected anger, maybe a sharp insult, but instead, he just laughed. Not a mocking laugh, but one that felt oddly warm.

Guess we both needed a wake-up call, he said, pulling napkins from the counter to help her clean up. His name was Ethan, a marketing consultant who, as it turned out, was also running late to the same meeting. They walked together in the rain, trading stories about bad mornings and worse bosses, their shoes splashing through puddles like kids who’d forgotten to care about being adults.

By the time they reached the office, the tension of the morning had melted into easy laughter. They ended up sitting next to each other during the meeting, exchanging knowing glances every time someone used corporate buzzwords like “synergy” or “optimization.”

That spilled coffee turned into a shared lunch, then a regular thing, coffee runs, brainstorming sessions, after-work walks. Months later, they started their own creative agency, the kind where work felt less like work and more like a daily adventure. Every success they built together traced back to that single moment of chaos on a rainy Monday morning.

Sometimes, Maya would still joke that the best decision she ever made was dropping her coffee. And Ethan would grin, replying, You didn’t drop it. You just spilled your way into a better life.

It was messy, it was unplanned, and it was real, just like all the best stories are.

Snippets:

1. ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. (CBS12) — There's a unique destination in Florida where visitors can sip coffee, cuddle capybaras, and contribute to wildlife conservation — all in one visit.
2. **Welcome to the Capybara Café, an interactive animal experience operated by Noah’s Ark Sanctuary, a nonprofit based in St. Augustine, Florida. Just 23 minutes from the sanctuary, the café offers guests a chance to meet exotic animals like lemurs, skunks, and of course, capybaras—the world’s largest rodents known for their gentle nature and love of water.**
3. “We want to make sure these animals are enjoying the betterment of the sanctuary,” said Trey King, General Manager of Capybara Café. “Capybaras are semi-aquatic creatures, so we ensure they get plenty of pool time back at the sanctuary.”
4. **Animal visits to the café are entirely voluntary. Carriers are placed at the sanctuary, and whichever animals choose to enter are transported to the café for the day. This ensures the animals are comfortable and stress-free during their interactions with guests, according to WTLV. The café features animals from USDA-approved vendors, as well as rescues and rehabilitated wildlife. Some are permanent residents, while others may eventually be released back into the wild.**
5. ""Education about conservation is incredibly important,” King emphasized. “It teaches us to protect what we love for future generations and helps us care for animals both in our facilities and in the wild.""
6. **Visitors can support these efforts by donating online or visiting the Capybara Café. For an additional donation, guests can book 30-minute “encounters” with animals like a lemur, a double-banded skunk, or even a screaming hairy armadillo.**
7. Whether you're an animal lover or a conservation enthusiast, the Capybara Café offers a heartwarming and educational experience that’s as impactful as it is adorable.",39,1761491790.0,florida,5,0.91,False

After months of testing, here’s my honest ranking for the [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/) season—complete with a few surprises and the usual tech hiccups.

* * *

### 1\. [IPTVMEEZZY](https://iptvmeezzy.life/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (yearly deals available)
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (strong coverage: US, UK, CA, EU, and a bit of everywhere else)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (rarely buffers, even when I’m streaming US sports and UK news at the same time)
    
*   **Firestick Use:** Setup on my **iptv firestick** was painless—always a plus.
    
*   **My experience:** I discovered this one after a Canadian **iptv reseller** tipped me off to their **free trial**. The channel variety is wild—one night I ended up watching a Swedish crime drama and a live US baseball game back-to-back, both without a glitch. It’s not flashy, but it just works, which is more than I can say for some “top rated iptv” options I tried.
    

* * *

### 2\. StreamVista

*   **Price:** $15/month
    
*   **Channels:** 37,000+ live, 115,000+ VOD (excellent US/UK/CA spread, with a nice chunk of EU content)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (almost always smooth, but a few hiccups during major US live events)
    
*   **Firestick Use:** Works well on my **iptv firestick**—the interface is simple and snappy.
    
*   **My experience:** StreamVista was my “unexpected favorite.” I mostly used it for UK football and Canadian morning shows. The EPG is straightforward, and the VOD is up-to-date with most big releases. I only noticed a little buffering during a massive US football night, but it sorted itself out quickly.
    

* * *

### 3\. EuroFlix IPTV

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 29,000+ live, 98,000+ VOD (EU/UK focus but plenty from US/CA too)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (great for movies, minor lag during big EU sports nights)
    
*   **Firestick Use:** Worked out of the box on my [**iptv firestick**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/).
    
*   **My experience:** EuroFlix IPTV is my go-to for EU films and UK series marathons. It’s a bit of a hidden gem for indie movies and weird documentaries. Most streams are reliable, but I did see a bit of lag during the Champions League final—maybe everyone else was watching, too?
    

* * *

### 4\. MapleCast TV

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 21,500+ live, 59,000+ VOD (strong Canadian and US selection, plus UK/EU mainstays)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (good for everyday use, but can get choppy during big Canadian sports events)
    
*   **Firestick Use:** No issues on my **iptv firestick**.
    
*   **My experience:** MapleCast TV shines for Canadian news and classic US sitcoms—perfect for putting on in the background while making breakfast. Their **free trial** was easy to activate, which helped me figure out if it fit my habits.
    

* * *

### 5\. UrbanWave IPTV

*   **Price:** $12/month
    
*   **Channels:** 16,000+ live, 44,000+ VOD (US/UK/CA/EU staples, but not as much niche content)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (mostly fine, but stutters during huge live events, especially in Europe)
    
*   **Firestick Use:** Needed one extra step to install on **iptv firestick**, but worked well after that.
    
*   **My experience:** UrbanWave IPTV is my fallback for low-stress TV time—think US reality shows or late-night UK comedy. Their **iptv reseller** area looks straightforward, but I’m just here for the streaming. It’s a solid choice if you want the essentials without the fuss.
    

* * *

A Few IPTV Insights from My 2025 Experiment
-------------------------------------------

*   **Always try the free trial**—it’s the best way to see what actually works for your devices and region.
    
*   Channel numbers sound impressive, but I always end up sticking to my regular favorites.
    
*   Even the [**top rated iptv**](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/) can get bogged down during massive live events (especially in the EU or US).
    
*   Using an **iptv firestick** keeps things simple, especially if you’re not a fan of complicated tech setups.
    
*   If you’re thinking about becoming an **iptv reseller**, be ready for lots of late-night troubleshooting!
    

No matter where you are—US, UK, CA, EU—finding a great [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/) comes down to your viewing habits and how much patience you have for the occasional hiccup. I’m always curious to hear about other hidden gems, so if you know one, send it my way.

I’m building a new house and in the living room, we will have a brilliant space to project. My preference would be a smart projector on the coffee table that is connected to wireless sound.

Could anyone 

A) suggest if this is possible 
B) suggest a good quality smart projector, or one that I could plug a google tv into.
C) suggest me a good way to wirelessly connect sound. Happy to have an amp and speakers, or a Sonos system.

1ogmzrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/LostPlanet/comments/1ogmzrq/lost_planet_2_on_pc_with_multiplayer_coop_post/,Lost Planet 2 on PC with multiplayer co-op [post gfwl removal on Steam ver. 17599994],"I just wanted to type this down, in case someone else is sent on an endless loop trying to get LP2 to work on PC. 

So the only reason that the older versions of the game fail to launch with ""Games for Windows Live"" is that there is no address being bounced from the xlive.dll calls being made. This prevents you from playing online, and it also makes your profile in the game available offline, only if you have previously had one and used it with gfwl. But without an override in the games-folder (i.e., xlive.dll), you're also relying on a windows service being installed, and also not destroyed by updates. Meaning that using the ""play offline"" solution only really applies to you if you found an ancient Windows 7 boot or something that was never updated, and that is physically cut off from the internet.

It's not a viable solution. 

Neither is replacing the xlive.dll file with an offline modded one (available), nor is simply overriding the settings for gfwl in the registry to use hamachi or radmin as the connection option. Because you still rely on the gfwl service being installed, and that it has previously been working to even launch the game.

However. If you use the latest Steam-version (the one with the core count fix and the dummy xlive.dll config), the game will actually run. ""System Link"" is not possible to use for routing/overriding settings for gfwl, so this basically only allows you offline play. But Capcom's config setup will at least just create a dummy-profile.

While I was in the process of decompiling this dll to figure out a way to hijack the gfwl settings, I made some searches, and it turns out that someone has already done a much better job of this than I ever could at github, with a project called [XLiveLessNess](https://gitlab.com/GlitchyScripts/xlivelessness/-/wikis/home).

You basically do the following:  
1. Get a working Steam copy with the 2025 May patches (Steam store page is currently taken down, and [gog.com](http://gog.com) doesn't have it - although the site is full of begging about getting it).

2. Replace xlive.dll in the game's root folder with the XLivelessness dll (the config tail in the official release doesn't do anything without the dll).

3. ""Create"" a profile with your nick of choice in the Xlivelessness script/popup dialogue box, select your virtual network adapter of choice, and optionally set your IP address to be the host. And now you can host games (using the gfwl service hook) that will be discoverable through hamachi, radmin, and so on.

You can in theory also do local/same-screen co-op by setting up more accounts, although I haven't tried this.

It's kind of a wonder that the game is basically left crippled like this. Because all that Capcom really had to do is to simply remove the xlive.dll hook, and use a ""LAN"" or IP-address hook (which was implemented). But I'm sure there are licensing agreements that are still in effect that prevents the game from not showing the xbl-logo whenever the game is run, or some game-profile is created.

In any case: yes, it is actually possible to play LP2 co-op with latest Steam version and XLiveLessNess. But no one around the radmin or hamachi communities seem to have noticed that XLiveLessNess is a thing. And none of the workarounds normally used actually work any more, because of the gfwl service needing to actually be running successfully to avoid it again.

Note that XLiveLessNess also will work with other gfwl games that are in the same limbo as LP2.

I guess this turned into an advertisement for [XLiveLessNess](https://gitlab.com/GlitchyScripts/xlivelessness/-/wikis/home) now..

**LET'S START WITH A QUICK PRE-RAMBLE, WHAT HAVE I BEEN UP TO?**

The last few posts have been about this thing we call the flywheel. We discussed setting up the components, the structure you need when you’re starting out in a new role (probably a good discipline to do it routinely anyways since the environment change so much these days). It’s critical to get the fundamentals right: understand the market, connect the dots, and see how you can help the company win.

***Well, that’s exactly what I’ve been doing. Mapping the flywheel of my new company.***

There’s this saying I hold dear: **the main thing is to make the main thing the main thing**. That’s exactly how I see it. The main thing is to succeed in my role right now. I love building things that help people, and the current version of that is fixing this one specific area of healthcare. I would've loved to write this more often, but my FP&A analyst decided to resign around W7, so I was a bit shorthanded backfilling him *and* backfilling for him, iykyk. Frustratingly, my predecessor underscoped the team so badly it’s wild. We had a dude who’s an ivy grad with PE background doing bookkeeping tasks. Like, literal AP cleanup, invoicing, and journal entries. What are we doing here.

So, the past few months i've been about mapping the flywheel, as in the company’s value creation plan, and really **immersing** myself in it. That's right **IMMERSION** is the last steep of the flywheel creation.

Now I’m coming out of the woodwork because I’ve made enough progress, and finally have enough free time write again.

**Here’s the story why I went into monk mode:** I had my first board meeting about six or seven weeks after joining. And let’s just say, it didn’t go as well as my usual standard.

The board meeting is kind of like the Super Bowl for finance execs. But I wasn’t fully ramped yet. After the meeting, my ceo pulled me aside and said, “Hey man, next time around, please be more prepared. There were a few moments where you weren’t as sharp as I know you can be. Like I know you before you start in this company, you can do better than that.” (ouch...)

He was right. He knows what I’m capable of, but that didn’t show yet. I didn’t know the business deeply enough. So the message was simple: ramp up fast.

And that’s exactly what I did.

I followed the same steps I’ve shared here, and this episode might be the most practical yet. You’ll get to see what it looks like when theory gets tested by reality.

**OK, NOW ON TO THE PRACTICAL ADVICE.** *Gentlemen, start your coffee machine. We're about to do some real work.*

*Before getting tactical though, I want to show you what great looks like.*

If you want to understand what a CFO with a true command of their company’s flywheel sounds like, go watch the [**Roblox 2023 Investor Day**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcsUexdj-tU). Seriously, block off a few hours, grab coffee, and watch it end to end. Around **1 hour 37 minutes in**, you’ll see CFO **Mike Guthrie** break down the Roblox business model in a way that’s both simple and deep. He moves seamlessly from user growth dynamics, to content ecosystem loops, to monetization velocity, connecting every lever. This one was a masterclass in how a CFO articulates the *engine* behind the numbers (and it was fun to be in the audience that day).

You can tell he doesn’t just know the numbers. He *sees the system.* This is what a mature flywheel understanding looks like when packaged and presented.

And it’s not just him. I suggest you pay attention to the entire investor day. Watch how every functional leader from product, platform, safety, economy. They talk through their piece of the ecosystem. They’re all speaking in flywheel terms, whether they realize it or not. “Here’s how we expand creation,” “Here’s how we build the economy,” “Here’s how engagement drives monetization.”

Now, I've watched many investor days in my prior life. Roblox Investor Day in particular gets a gold star because this looks like how we actually do this strategy day internally at FAANG. Most investor days are basically sales pitches, just overly-polished demos that could’ve doubled as a sales conference. This session does a great job walking you through the actual physics of the business.

That’s why I recommend watching it. Don’t just study the CFO slides. Watch how each segment builds on the previous one, creating a loop between creator growth, developer economics, engagement, and monetization. That’s what a flywheel *feels* like when it’s nicely articulated.

And that’s what we’re all trying to do, replicate that kind of system-level clarity in our own companies.

**NOW, BACK TO US**. *How do you get there? How do you build that kind of deep understanding?*

There’s no shortcut. You talk to people, read, think deeply, synthesize, ask for feedback, share it out, and iterate. You map the business, think about it in the shower, until it’s second nature. There’s no magic formula. **You’ve got to do the work.**

Reading is good, but the highest-return on time spent is having **real conversations**. Talk to investors, bankers, product leads, and especially your CEO. Founders always have things in their heads that never make it into a slide deck. You’ve got to surface those.

When you’re studying a business, pay attention to how different leaders articulate their piece of the puzzle, how product talks about the ecosystem, how ops talks about the economy, how marketing connects it to monetization. That’s the flywheel in motion.

Now, the practical steps, or as I call them, the lego blocks. *These are the things that I actually did in the past 3 months.*

**1. Find the right people.** [**Talk to Donna**](https://www.reddit.com/r/FPandA/comments/1lhwm2g/craftcfo_week_3_mbr_went_fine_we_caught_a_40k/)**.**

There’s always someone who knows everything. They're not necessarily the most senior or political, but the one with the best pulse on the business. Could be a product manager, a long-tenured ops lead, or that quiet strategy guy who actually gets it. Talk to them.

**2. Understand the thesis.**

What’s the investment case for your company? For a public company, what’s the aspiration? For Roblox, the thesis was: move beyond gaming, “age up” the audience, and expand monetization (only 20% of their interactions at the time generated revenue).

**3. Get an outside view (perspective beyond your company).**

Talk to investors and bankers. If you’re at a PE-backed company, reach out to your partners or analysts. Ask them how they see the market evolving, and whether the original thesis is still holding up.

**4. Study the industry.**

Read investor days, banking reports, and white papers. In healthcare, for instance, Humana’s Investor Day is a masterclass. Watch it. Then watch their older ones to see how predictions evolve and play out.

**5. Do the work.**

Immerse yourself. I’ve been in this game for years, and still, every time I dig deeper, I find something new. Sometimes small details that have big implications, like a regulatory quirk or proposal that changes the economics of the model.

And then once you do all of the above, you can start embedding what you find into your day job. Turn it into something tangible, your annual plan, your next fundraise deck, or even onboarding for new employees.

When I was at FAANG, we’d have 30-40 new analysts join every quarter. One of us would give a session called How X Works from A to Z, to help the new hires ramp up faster. If your company doesn’t have something like that, may not be a bad idea to start. If it does, it probably needs updating soon.

**A QUICK EXAMPLE**

Let’s make it real for a second. Say you’re joining a healthcare company that works with Medicare Advantage. What do you actually do?

First, you go learn how that ecosystem even functions. Who pays whom, where the incentives are, what regulations are changing. You can go start watch the major players investor day and earnings call. [Humana Investor Day 2025](https://humana.gcs-web.com/events/event-details/humana-inc-2025-investor-conference) is full of 4 hours of goodness and Kentucky drawl - yum yum. Learn how they describe their business. Go back to the old ones. See what they said five years ago, what actually happened, and how they responded when it didn’t. You’ll start to see the DNA of the industry.

And then you want to find **the** bible of your industry. Every industry has one of these. In healthcare, we are blessed by *The Healthcare Handbook.* It was written by two doctors who basically were so frustrated because in order to treat patients they need to become MBAs. So they wrote this to help other doctors decode the system. It’s a crash course for how U.S. healthcare *really* works, who holds the risk, who holds the data, and why every reform seems to create three new middlemen.

And beyond that, we’re lucky to have this creator economy. In healthcare, we have people like me who do stuff for fun and share knowledge. Dr. Eric Bicker publishing youtube channel [A Healthcare Z](https://www.youtube.com/@ahealthcarez/videos), which is is essentially a bunch of whiteboarding lecture sessions. He's literally doing game-theory on the whole thing: “If you’re a CEO at health plan X, here’s what you’re worried about this quarter, and you will do Y because of Z"" kinda stuff.

Same story in every industry, you've got Ben Thompson in tech, Drew Fallon in ecommerce, and obviously the infamous steve zissou on critical minerals.

**THAT WRAPS OUR FLYWHEEL SERIES**

So yeah, hopefully this helps, especially as we head into annual planning session. It's the perfect time to zoom out, reflect on what really drives our business, and make sure that our model actually captures these levers.

If you've got questions, drop them in the comments or DM as usual. I'll try to reply when I can, though again, I have a full time job that needs to be the main thing.

**Next week,** I might do something on storytelling (which is a natural extension of flywheel). I’ve seen a few threads where people are struggling, and I’ve got thoughts. Let me know if there's interest, but also feel free to vote 👎 if you've seen too many people covering this already.

Until then, good luck with planning season and happy halloween.

Atkins, Mediterranean, low carb, weight watchers. If it was a diet in the 90’s, my mom did it. And she drug me along with her. I did weight watchers on and off between the ages of 12-18, even going to meetings. We were eating frozen low calories meals because they were “healthier.” I would be so stressed about not having enough points left.  I would have a meltdown if my family decided to go out to eat and I was low on points. Once I was 15, I just tried to do it on my own because I was so worried about being bigger than everyone else, looking back at pictures, I was not fat, but I was curvy and more developed when most of the girls my age were not yet. 

I had such a bad relationship with food and how I viewed my body. When I moved out on my own, I was a binge eater. As an adult, I feel like I self sabotaged myself every time I tried to lose weight because I went in with a mindset that I was just going to be miserable eating foods that fit my calorie goal and then eventually give up. Based on previous efforts, I also know that I cannot have a scale in my house. I would weigh multiple times a day and stress about it. I was also pretty mentally unwell with undiagnosed anxiety that only got worse. 

I’m now in my 30’s. My mental health is significantly better. I started at 249lbs. I’ve been around this weight since having my last kid 6 years ago. A month in and I’m at 236.8lbs, my clothes are fitting better, I feel better. I spent about two weeks strictly counting calories in a tracker without really changing my diet to see what I was consuming. The next two weeks I started on calorie deficit and tracked everything, swapping out things I love for more calorie wise versions and eat smaller portions. I knew I was losing weight based on how my clothes started to fit better and I do a weigh in once a week or so when I go to my parents house. 

I still go out to eat, I just eat half of the meal or less and take the rest to go. I drink coffee with flavored creamer every morning. I don’t always stay at my calorie goal, sometimes I go over a few hundred calories. When I know I’m over, I don’t beat myself up about it and decide to binge the rest of the weekend like I would in the past. There is no “start again on Monday” anymore. If I go over one day, I just get back on track the next day. 

Not sure if this is helpful to anyone, but just wanted to share my experience as yo-yo dieter for over half of my life and as someone who LOVES good food. I’m learning to love my body the way it is now and as it changes and fix my relationship with food along the way. ",4,1761491082.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,1.0,False

1ogmuvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1ogmuvq/is_there_a_way_to_adjust_the_dose/,Is there a way to adjust the dose ?,"Hello guys I’m new into the coffee world and got my moka pot recently. I used it twice for the moment. My pot makes 3 cups and I enjoy this blessed beverage alone. I felt like 3 cups are a little too much for me and I can’t seem to find a pot that makes 2 cups only. All that I found in stores make either 1 cup or 3 cups or more. So my question to you guys, is there a way I can reduce the amount of coffee without messing up the taste ? Like can I fill water a little lower than below the relief valve and can I put coffee in the funnel less than filling the whole thing ? If not, do you recommend like keeping the rest in the fridge and use for iced coffee or what do you advise me with ?

1ogmtdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1ogmtdo/aita_for_getting_a_restraining_order_against_my/,"AITA for getting a restraining order against my dad and causing my parents' divorce after he ""investigated"" my fiancée?","My dad has always been protective. Maybe too protective. He never liked anyone I dated. My high school girlfriend was ""too clingy."" My college ex was ""too ambitious."" When I got engaged six months ago, I thought he'd finally be happy for me. My fiancée is kind, works as a nurse, and treats me better than anyone ever has.

But two weeks after I proposed, my dad started with the comments.

""She's moving pretty fast, don't you think?""

""Has she asked about your salary yet?""

""Just be careful, son.""

I brushed it off. My mom seemed to like my fiancée. We had dinner at their house a few times. Everything felt normal.

Then my dad called me at work three months ago. His voice was tight, urgent.

""We need to talk. In person. Tonight.""

I met him at a coffee shop near his office. He slid a manila folder across the table.

""I had a friend look into her background,"" he said. ""You need to see this.""

Inside were bank statements, credit reports, court documents. At first, I didn't understand what I was looking at. Then I saw the name at the top. It was similar to my fiancée's name but spelled differently. Different middle initial. Different birthday.

""Dad, this isn't her.""

""Look at the address history.""

I looked. The woman in these documents had lived in three states my fiancée had never been to.

""This isn't the same person,"" I said slowly. ""The birthday is wrong. The spelling is wrong.""

My dad's jaw tightened. ""She probably changed it. People do that when they're running from debt.""

""Dad, stop.""

""I'm trying to protect you.""

I stood up. ""You hired someone to investigate my fiancée and brought me fake documents. We're done here.""

I left. I should have known it wouldn't end there.

Over the next few weeks, my dad called my mom constantly. I'd get texts from her asking weird questions.

""Does your fiancée have family nearby?""

""Where did she grow up again?""

""Has she mentioned any ex-husbands?""

I finally called my mom and asked what was going on.

She hesitated. ""Your father is just worried. He thinks she's hiding something.""

""She's not hiding anything. Dad literally showed me documents for a different person.""

""He's convinced there's more to the story.""

""There isn't.""

My mom sighed. ""Just talk to him. Please.""

But I didn't want to talk to him. I wanted to marry my fiancée and move on with my life.

Two months before the wedding, my dad sent me an email. The subject line was ""Final Warning."" Inside was a three-page letter detailing why my fiancée was using me for a green card, even though she was born in this country. He claimed she had secret debt. That she'd been married before. That her nursing license was fake.

I forwarded it to my fiancée. She read it and cried for an hour.

""Why does he hate me?"" she asked.

""I don't know.""

""I've never done anything to him.""

""I know.""

That night, I called my dad.

""You're uninvited from the wedding,"" I said.

Silence.

""You've made my fiancée feel like garbage for months based on nothing. You hired someone to dig up dirt and came back with documents for the wrong person. You've been poisoning mom against her. I'm done.""

""You're making a mistake,"" he said quietly.

""The only mistake I made was not shutting this down sooner.""

I hung up.

My mom called ten minutes later, sobbing.

""You can't uninvite your father.""

""I just did.""

""He's your dad. He loves you.""

""He doesn't respect me. There's a difference.""

She begged. She pleaded. She said I was tearing the family apart. I told her she was still invited but if she brought my dad, they'd both be removed.

The next few weeks were hell. My dad sent letters to my apartment. He showed up at my office. He called my fiancée's work and asked to speak to her supervisor, claiming there was a ""family emergency."" Her boss pulled her aside, confused. When she called me in tears, I filed a restraining order.

My mom stopped speaking to me entirely.

But my fiancée's family was incredible. Her parents flew in two weeks before the wedding to help with final preparations. They insisted on hosting a dinner to meet my side of the family.

I didn't know what to tell them. That my dad was banned? That my mom wasn't speaking to me?

My fiancée squeezed my hand. ""Invite your mom. Maybe she'll show up.""

I sent the invitation. I didn't expect a response.

She came.

My mom walked into that restaurant looking exhausted. My future mother-in-law greeted her warmly, hugged her, and said how excited she was to officially become family.

We sat down to dinner. Conversation was stilted at first. Then my future father-in-law mentioned something about his daughter's childhood, about how she'd always wanted to be a nurse after watching her grandmother recover from surgery.

My mom perked up. ""Where was that?""

""St. Mary's Hospital. Right here in town.""

My mom frowned. ""Your family is from here?""

""Born and raised,"" my future mother-in-law said. ""We've been in this area for three generations.""

""But..."" my mom trailed off.

""What's wrong?"" I asked.

My mom looked at me, then at my fiancée. ""Your father said she was from out of state. That she moved here recently. That her background was suspicious because there were no local records.""

My fiancée blinked. ""I've lived here my whole life except for college.""

My future father-in-law pulled out his phone. ""Here, these are photos from her high school graduation. That's the community center down on Maple Street.""

He showed my mom pictures spanning decades. Birthday parties at local parks. Family reunions at the same restaurant we were sitting in. My fiancée's nursing school graduation at the university across town.

My mom went pale.

""He said he couldn't find anything about your family,"" she whispered. ""He said you appeared out of nowhere.""

""We've been here longer than you have,"" my future mother-in-law said gently. ""We moved here in 1987.""

My mom and dad moved here in 1995.

We sat in silence. My mom's hands were shaking.

""What else did he tell you?"" I asked.

She looked at me. Really looked at me. ""Everything. He said she was using you. That she had debt. That she'd been married before. That her license was fake. He showed me documents.""

""For a different person,"" I said.

""He said she'd changed her name.""

My fiancée's voice was quiet. ""I've never changed my name. I've never been married. I don't have debt. You can verify my license online right now if you want.""

My mom pulled out her phone. Her fingers moved quickly. We watched her face change as she looked up the nursing board website, typed in my fiancée's name, and found her active license with her photo.

""Oh my god,"" she breathed.

My future father-in-law cleared his throat. ""I don't mean to pry, but has your husband been having any unusual behavior lately? Memory issues? Confusion?""

My mom shook her head slowly. ""No. He's been very focused. Very detailed. He spent months on this.""

""Months lying to you,"" I said.

She flinched.

The rest of the dinner was awkward. My mom kept apologizing. My fiancée was gracious but I could see the hurt in her eyes. When we said goodbye, my mom hugged her tight.

""I'm so sorry,"" she whispered. ""I should have questioned him. I should have met your parents sooner. I should have trusted my son.""

My fiancée hugged her back.

That night, my mom called me.

""I'm leaving your father,"" she said.

I almost dropped my phone. ""What?""

""He lied to me for months. He manufactured evidence. He tried to destroy your relationship based on nothing. When I confronted him tonight, he didn't apologize. He said he was protecting you from a mistake.""

""Mom...""

""He said even if she's not a scammer, she's still not good enough for you. That no one will ever be good enough. That he knows what's best for you and I was stupid for doubting him.""

Her voice cracked.

""I've spent twenty years listening to him tear down everyone in your life. Your friends weren't smart enough. Your girlfriends weren't pretty enough. Your job wasn't impressive enough. And I went along with it because I thought he was just being a concerned father. But he's not concerned. He's controlling. And I'm done.""

She stayed at a hotel that night. She came to the wedding. She walked me down the aisle.

My dad sent a letter the day after the wedding. It was addressed to both of us. Inside was a single sentence.

""You'll regret this when she shows her true colors.""

My wife read it and laughed. Then she tore it up.

We've been married for four months now. My mom moved into her own apartment and filed for divorce. She has dinner with us once a week. She and my mother-in-law have become friends.

My dad still sends letters. I don't open them.

But sometimes I wonder if I should have handled it differently. My mom says I did the right thing but I can tell she's struggling with the divorce. My wife says my dad made his choices but I know she's hurt by how he treated her.

**Was I wrong to cut him off so completely instead of trying to fix whatever is broken in him?**

1ogmrqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BookPromotion/comments/1ogmrqg/my_2025_iptv_provider_ranking_coffee_curiosity/,"My 2025 IPTV Provider Ranking: Coffee, Curiosity & Channel Chaos","If there’s one thing I’ve learned after another year of late-night streaming and way too much caffeine, it’s that choosing the **best iptv providers** is more complicated than picking a new coffee blend. I’ve tested a bunch of options across the US, UK, CA, and EU, juggling everything from hockey games to British panel shows. Here’s my honest take on the [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) contenders that made my shortlist this year.

* * *

### 1\. [IPTVMEEZZY](https://iptvmeezzy.life/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (yearly discounts available)
    
*   **Channel Lineup:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (seriously global: US, UK, CA, EU, and more)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (rarely any buffering even when I’m streaming US sports and UK news at the same time)
    
*   **Firestick Ready:** No headaches setting up on my **iptv firestick**.
    
*   **Personal Take:** I first heard about IPTVMEEZZY from a UK **iptv reseller** who swore by their **free trial**. What stood out for me was just how hassle-free the connection was. Canadian morning news, EU documentaries, and US sitcoms all played without a hitch even with multiple streams going at once. The interface is minimalist, which I appreciate when I’m half-awake and on my third cup of coffee.
    

* * *

### 2\. BrightStream TV

*   **Price:** $15/month
    
*   **Channels:** 36,000+ live, 110,000+ VOD (heavy on US/UK, enough CA/EU to keep things interesting)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (generally steady, with only minor hiccups during peak US sports)
    
*   **Firestick Ready:** Worked right away on my **iptv firestick**, which is always a relief.
    
*   **Personal Take:** BrightStream TV was a pleasant surprise. I initially signed up for their **free trial** just to compare, but I ended up using it a lot more than I expected. Their EPG makes it easy to find UK drama reruns or CA hockey games. The only time I noticed any lag was during a massive US football night otherwise, pretty smooth.
    

* * *

### 3\. EuroView IPTV

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 28,000+ live, 90,000+ VOD (EU and UK focus, but lots of US/CA thrown in)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (excellent for VOD and most live TV, but big EU events can cause a little lag)
    
*   **Firestick Ready:** Smooth install and play on my **iptv firestick**.
    
*   **Personal Take:** EuroView IPTV is my go-to for rainy Sunday afternoons and late-night Euro movie binges. The VOD section is stronger than I expected, with plenty of UK classics and French films. Most streams are reliable, but I did notice some buffering during a huge EU football final maybe everyone else was watching, too.
    

* * *

### 4\. MapleCast Streams

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 20,000+ live, 65,000+ VOD (solid CA and US coverage, plus UK/EU essentials)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (great for day-to-day, but can slow down a bit during big live events)
    
*   **Firestick Ready:** No issues running on **iptv firestick**.
    
*   **Personal Take:** MapleCast Streams is my “background TV” pick perfect for having Canadian news or US talk shows on while I cook. Their **free trial** was quick to set up, which made trying them out risk-free. The EPG is straightforward, and while it’s not as flashy as others, it gets the job done.
    

* * *

Some IPTV Thoughts After a Year of Channel Surfing
--------------------------------------------------

*   **Always try the free trial**—there’s no better way to see if a provider fits your habits and devices.
    
*   Even [**top rated iptv**](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/) setups can struggle during huge live events, especially in the EU or US.
    
*   Channel numbers are fun, but I always end up rotating through my regular favorites.
    
*   Using an **iptv firestick** really keeps things simple (even if you’re not a tech wizard).
    
*   If you’re thinking about being an **iptv reseller**, be ready for a lot of tech questions from friends and family!
    

No matter where you’re tuning in from US, UK, CA, EU the [best **iptv subscription**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) **2025** is the one that fits your routine and doesn’t stress you out. If you stumble onto a hidden gem, let me know! For now, I’ll be here, coffee in hand, probably watching another rerun.",1,1761490805.0,BookPromotion,0,1.0,False

🌲 Outdoors stuff – I love hiking with our two huskies, foraging, and just started learning pickleball (I’m still terrible, but it’s fun).

Not gonna lie, I'm a bit anxious about it. Looking forward to the positive effects but I'm a bit scared of what could go wrong. That and my irrational fear of needles, but there's nothing I could do about that one. I have some questions for the more experienced users:

\- did you experience any hair loss? I have very long hair and I don't have any type of hair loss issue, but I know that if you lose weight fast, you might experience hair loss (from restrictive diets for example) 

\- how did you keep up with your protein intake? I don't eat much meat so protein was always a struggle for me

\- this might be a weirder one, but do you think I'd have any issues drinking sparkly water with lemon juice? I can't drink plain water (to the point of drinking 0.5L in a week), but sparkly lemon water I can drink plenty of it so that's how I keep myself hydrated 

\- I drink (sometimes way too much) coffee 😅 will this affect me in any way? 

\- when did you need to increase the dose? Of course I'll not do this on my own and consult with my doctor, but I'm curious about your experience as I'm assuming there's no ""standard"" process for it

He’s at his office job for pretty much the whole day (9 am-8 pm). I barely get to see him. But when I do, he’s always glued to his phone. He WILL NOT let it go. When he uses the bathroom, when making coffee, when getting ready, even if he’s on the phone with family or friends he’s also scrolling on his phone. He rarely even has the patience to put it into the charger and let it charge, he’ll usually just scroll on it while it’s plugged in. He’s also almost always wearing noise canceling ear buds and is listening to podcasts/youtube videos. The news, stocks, engineering, AI, food topics - he has a lot of interests and likes to learn about random things. 

He could be on his phone for HOURS. But he can’t be with me for more than 30 mins MAX without it. Him and I can’t have a conversation. The phone has completely taken over. 

I get that he needs to unwind but to unwind 90% of the time that you’re not in work seems excessive. I bring it up a lot. But it doesn’t seem to really click with him. I mean it clicks in the sense that he knows it bothers me, but not enough to see it as an issue he’s willing to seriously work on.  

It’s coming in the way of our communication, intimacy (which btw he’ll hop on twitter the second we’re done being intimate), his time with our child, his quality of sleep, etc. He’s always got some excuse to be on it (checking out good deals on groceries, buying us some coffee, catching up on news). He’s mainly on twitter. Sometimes YouTube. And then a little of texting family/friends, Reddit, and other apps. He doesn’t have any dumb social media apps like Instagram, TikTok etc. 

I’ve talked about this so many times and no changes have happened. In fact, I feel like it’s getting worse. He has no hobbies, doesn’t go to the gym, doesn’t have any friends. His phone sees his face more than I do. 

Idk what to do. I’m so tired of bringing it up. He’s overall a great husband. Loyal. Helpful. Pleasant. Loving. But that’s for the few moments in a week that he even gives us the chance to interact. 

I’ve asked for phone free days/time slots but it’s never honored or taken seriously. Idk what to do. Or if I should just accept it and let it be and accept my reality…

The office on Mjonir -D was bigger than the last one, the ship itself was bigger too. Those bastards, one in particular, had finally found a solution to how to make him a flight instructor. They had moved the whole damn elite piloting class to his ship, Mjonir D was not only bigger but had seven support ships, it was also no longer a frigate but a damn command carrier. The ship now carries five hundred fighters. How the hell would they be able to sneak up on the pirates now?  He looked at his new desk., at the hologram of his wife and their two kids. Both had grown up, Hunda was the one not following his career, he had married a sciyan noble lady and was working in administration. He was damn proud of him. His second son was on the ship; they called him teddy bear, which was funny considering how feared he was on the battlefield. He had studied under Roks and was among his elite, yet the boy was a teddy bear waiting to have his heart ripped out by some girl. His mum was watching over him like a bird of prey. It was funny.

He looked at the files he was supposed to work on, but his eyes drifted over to the wall. A large screen with all the intel he had found about that damn snake. He stared at it. The bastard popped up once a year to do something, just to remind them. He blew up a factory, held a speech, and vanished.  But in the last three years, he had not shown up, not after his people successfully attacked Dirt and the Adams family. He had gone underground, and some new speeches had emerged, recordings, but they had nothing to track him down with.   So he changed his tactic.  He was looking for his safe houses, where the bastard would escape to. He had noticed a pattern in the escape paths. The distance and time it took him to re-emerge. He was fairly certain of which sector the bastard would escape to when he peeked his head up again. That’s where he would go, he had placed out spy drones in these sectors. Now it was a waiting game. He looked at his watch, it was time to meet the new captains of the support ships. He got up and headed to the officers' lounge. Admiral Toberus Gi Iven met him in the elevator, and he smiled.

“Have you seen who they attached to us?”

Alak sighed. “We got the princess… Yeah, I saw.”

“Have you seen her scores?”

“No? How is she?”

“Just up my alley, unconventional, among the top, and several reprimands for not following orders, she survived the Charon test by disobeying orders. Rescued the ships, and escaped.” The Admiral said, and Alak looked at him.

“That’s one way to do it. I failed that one. Has anybody actually won within the parameters?”

“Only one, Guess who?”

“Admiral Roks? You’re going to say Roks? He doesn’t count. He is the bloody good of war. we could give him a bottle of water, and he would take down a dreadnought.”

“Well,  a squirt of water in the wrong system would take down a dreadnaught, but we both know he would use it to distract some guard and use that guard's body to beat the crew senseless…  Just like your son, I just watched him take apart some new recruits.”

“he gets it from his mom.  She was very proud when she read about the latest report. The damn fool has just been a sergeant for a year, and he has already made a name for himself.”

“I heard, Teddybear.”  The admiral said with a wink, and then they both chuckled.

“The worst part is that he doesn’t dislike it,” Alak said as the elevator door opened and they walked towards the officer's lounge.

“He is a Marin. I don’t expect to understand their sense of humor, any more than with you pilots. What's your call sign again?”

“Daddy. Yes, I know. Pilots are just as weird.”

The doors opened, and they entered the lounge. The room was filled with the high-ranking officers and the seven new captains. Alak recognized them all, but there was one who outshone the whole room without trying. In fact, she wanted to tone it down, but Captain Sarah Wrangler was anything but normal; she was nobility, and one look revealed it. There was just something about Adam's children, they felt like royalty, no matter how much they tried to hide it.

 The Admiral held his speech, the same one he held every year, then they had a drink and were given their assignment. But then the Admiral held them back instead of dismissing them. This was the maiden voyage of the ship, so that the ship would be inspected by Admiral Roks and King Adam tomorrow before they would take off. Alak mentally cursed. Damn inspections, he would delegate that preparation to his officers.  When he was dismissed, he headed down to his office and called in his officers.

“Surprise! We get an inspection from the royals!” He said with a grin as he poured himself a cup of coffee.

“Fancy inspection or serious one? And who is coming?” DJ asked as he sat down and got out his pad.

“Fancy, I guess, the King and Roks, probably some others as well,” Alak replied.

“Probably just checking up on his daughter. What do we have to worry about?” Bard replied.

“Yeah, well, we have six hundred pilots and five hundred ships that need to appear to be cleaned and ready for combat.”

“That’s Mum’s department, I’m just here to chew the bad ones up,” Lovebite replied, and Mum sighed.

“How long do I have?”  She asked, and Alak sipped his coffee.

“Seventeen hours.”

“Well, I’m screwed, wait, I know, we put them next to the Marines. Those grunts will mess up more than we do. I've never seen them be able to pass a proper inspection.”

“Are you sure about that?” Alak asked with a small smile on his face. “Okay, it’s your funeral. I will make the arrangements.”

“I’ll have the fighters cleaning for the fancy parade,” Then Tech looked at Mum. “You do know who's among the new sergeants, right?”

“Who?” Mum said.

The others just grinned and didn’t reply. “Who?” she asked again.

.

.

Alak stood in front of the rows of pilots, all dressed up and in their finest. Mum was next to him, cursing as she looked over at the Marines.

“You could have told me your son was their new sergeant? Damn. How the hell did he get those monkeys to stand in line? I heard they called him teddy bear?”

Alek chuckled, “Oh, he is a teddy bear if you behave, and what was the word the humans said? A berserk grizzly if you piss him off. If they get shot, they don’t die before he gives them permission.”

“Little Sammi?” She looked over at the Marines and the sergeant standing in front with the rest of the officers. He was just a lean, mean killing machine with short black hair, purple skin, and a body that made her wish she were young again.

“How do you two do that? I remember him as a shy teenager when you guys sent him to the youth academy. He is all grown up, with a body like that, he must already have a harem.”

“Nope, he found religion and is saving himself for the one,” Alak said with a grin. “I have no idea where he got that from.”

DJ looked over at Sammi and back to Alak. “Seriously? He is not on the market? How?”

“He is a marine. No offence, but they are not known for their intelligence. They do something to them, I swear. Remove half the brain when they are in service, and they get it back if they receive an honorable discharge. Wait, is that an accommodation I see? Fuck me,” Lovebite said. “God, I wish I were young again.”

“He is still my son, so control yourself. And here they come, so shut it.” Alak said as Adam and Roks came over, along with the Admiral, who was behind them, a few civilians followed. The two seemed to be in good mode. They stopped in front of him. He recognized the rest of the group. It was Roks and Adams' kids, not kids, he remembered. They just celebrated their eighteenth birthday, and made a big scandal too. They were probably dragged along as punishment.

“My favorite pilot, it’s good to see you again,” Adam said, and Alak saluted.

“Thank you, sir! It's always a pleasure.” Alak had given up trying to address those two by proper terminology, they treated him as a colleague and friend, protocol be damned. They barely tolerated him calling them Sir in public.

“So how is the hunting going?”  Roks asked.

“Doing well, Sir. Pretty sure I can get him the next time he sticks his head out. As for his groups, we have a few to visit on our rounds. Need to break in the new pilots.”

“Good,” Roks turned to the kids. “Do you know who he is?”

“The hunter? Isn’t that what you call him?”  Parn replied, and Roks nodded.

“If you work hard, he might deem you good enough to stand behind him among those pilots.  Do you want to be the best fighter pilot? Well, getting to stand behind him is the first step.”

“I thought Hyd-drin was the best pilot.” The young man replied, the six other young adults was already bored.

“Hyd-Drin is the best pilot, only one pilot has managed to shoot him down in the war games.  That’s Alek. Five times, so not just by luck. You have to learn from both. Hyd-Drin will teach you how to fly, and he will teach you how to fight with a fighter.”

The boy looked at Alak and nodded seriously. “I will work hard and earn the right, Sir!”

“Good, I’m looking forward to it,” Alak replied. Adam smiled, then noticed his daughter was staring at the Marines, her mouth agape.

“Who is he?” she asked, and Adam looked towards the Marins and chuckled. “You have to be a little more specific. There are six hundred of them.”

“The sergeant... the one with purple skin,”

“I told you we shouldn’t have stopped by Kywar on the way.” Roks said as he started to laugh.

The abuse happened for years and I waited on my mother to be comfortable enough to report it. That's what they say right? The victim should be comfortable enough to report it on their own? I finally realized nothing was going to change, I couldn't rely on her, and she was also putting me in danger. So I took matters into my own hands, and in a matter of a single week, we had a protective order. I staged a (bigger) family intervention, and practically forced her to report/admit it, alongside the rest of us who were witnesses/victims. Not only has he not showed his face ever since, he hasn't even messaged any of us, directly or indirectly. **I've always read stories of women who sought help and the police betrayed them, or they got a restraining order and got immediately killed. Many variations, all ending up with her being the victim. I think this created a limiting belief in me, and I would've done something sooner if I'd read more success stories. So, I would like this thread to be one of those spaces where we can share similar stories (not necessarily linked to abuse!).**

I would also like to share another recent story. A (male) coworker had been on my ass for months (it took me a while to understand it, I'm not very privy to subtle male flirtation, nor do I care to be). I work an office job, we didn't quite work directly, so it was easy to ignore his passes. However, one day he asked me to go with him for coffee at the office kitchen. I said no, I'm busy. He pressed on. I kept saying no. He just stood there, looking offended. I didn't cover my rejection in smiles or awkward laughs, just ""no, I'm busy"" (mind you I made sure to close all my tabs on my monitors so he knew I wasn't.) His stupid mug pissed me off so bad that I went straight to HR the next day. At first I debated going to our manager at first, instead of taking it straight to HR. I looked at reddit posts for how to report such issues, and they were all demoralizing. Pretty much everyone said, don't bother, you'll be the one who'll get fired. I decided I wasn't going to let myself be dissuaded any longer. I'm not going to be the one making sure he doesn't face consequences. I went to HR and I was believed. I didn't need to show screenshots of anything. They apologized to ME for this entire situation, and thanked me for reporting now rather than later. I don't know if they did anything, but the guy hasn't even looked my way once ever since. I even intentionally put myself in situations where he could talk to me, and he didn't even make eye contact.

There's so many demoralizing stories out there. They're true, and I feel for all victimized women and girls. But not all stories end that way, and I think we (as a women's space) should bring more attention to that.

I realize that I might still end up a victim at the hands of the men I wrote about here. But I don't care about that for now, I think I'll feel happy and relieved for a bit :)",25,1761490252.0,4bmovement,1,0.97,False

Ah, football! Where managers live in existential dread, goalkeepers zen out during crises, and fans throw tomatoes like it’s a *Verona* subplot. Let’s dive into this week’s chaos, because why not?  

**Europe’s Drama Club**  
- **Liverpool’s Arne Slot** is *concerned*. Like, *“Is my coffee lukewarm enough?”* level of concern. Meanwhile, **Bayern Munich fans** are throwing a hissy fit over Josip Šimunić and Jerome Boateng being benched. Spoiler: The tomatoes are coming.  
- **Olympique de Marseille**’s manager, De Zerbi, is fretting over Weah like it’s a *Netflix thriller*. But Rulli, the goalkeeper, is chilling with the coolness of a man who’s seen *every* Marseille fan’s worst Twitter rant.  

**Lineup Shenanigans**  
Probable team lineups for Ligue 1 matches? More like *probable guesses* written by a sleep-deprived intern. Lyon vs. Strasbourg? Real Madrid vs. Barcelona? It’s all just a *“hope for the best”* lottery.  

**Post-Match Drama**  
- **Napoli’s Conte** is dealing with internal matters. Translation: “I have more problems than my ex’s Instagram captions.”  
- **Benatia** tested positive post-defeat? That’s not a drug test—it’s a *plot twist*.  
- **Pavard** apologized for his performance. Fair. But can he apologize for his hair? That’s the real crime.  

**Portugal vs. USA: The Chess Game**  
Coach Neto called the U.S. strategy a “chess game.” *Sure, Francisco. Let’s call it that. Meanwhile, I’m calling my mom to ask why she thinks this is exciting.* Portugal’s young players are “energetic and ambitious,” per Tatiana Pinto. Translation: “They’ll probably trip over their own feet, but at least they’re trying.”  

**Napoli’s Rise to Glory**  
Napoli defeated Inter Milan, moving into first place. Because nothing says “dominance” like a headline that *doesn’t mention the score*. Mystery!  

**Trabzonspor’s Aggressive Zen**  
Trabzonspor beat Eyüpspor 2-0, and coach Ogün Temizkanoğlu praised their “aggressive desire.” Because nothing says “aggressive” like two goals and a speech that sounds like it was written by a motivational poster.  

**Liga MX’s Time Capsule**  
June 2025’s headlines are here! Telcel and Motorola are giving away Club World Cup tickets. Max is now the home of the Premier League. And someone named Baruch Camaño is telling us all about it. Also, 24 trips to the Champions League? Sounds like a *fantasy camp* for people who can’t afford a vacation.  

**In Summary**  
Football is a dumpster fire of drama, but we’re all here for it. From managers sweating over lineups to goalkeepers refusing to panic, it’s a week where even the most casual fan can’t escape the chaos. Now, go enjoy the Portugal vs. USA chess match. And if you trip over your own feet while cheering, at least you’ll be in character.

1ogmggp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Uganda/comments/1ogmggp/best_investment_opportunities_in_uganda_with_33/,Best Investment Opportunities in Uganda with 33% and more return(with proof),"Hey everyone,

I’m trying to research high-return investments in Uganda — I’m talking 33%+ annual returns, not vague “you’ll get rich” promises.

I know that sounds high, but I’ve seen some government and media reports mentioning agro-processing projects (like beef or leather) with IRRs around 30–40%. That made me curious if anyone here has actually invested in something in Uganda that gave real, verifiable high returns — not Ponzi stuff or crypto hype.

So I’m asking:

What sectors or businesses in Uganda actually deliver those kinds of returns?

Has anyone here tried value addition (e.g., maize, coffee, bananas, etc.) and tracked the ROI?

Are there legit, audited projects or funds that hit that 30–40% IRR range?

Any proof or sources (UIA reports, investor decks, real numbers) you can share?


Low risk/No risk as well

​specially interested in real examples — not sales pitches.
If you’ve invested in Uganda and made (or lost) money, please share your experience.

Let’s crowdsource what’s real vs. what’s just talk.

1ogmffp,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Ilthari_Library/comments/1ogmffp/another_sun_chapter_11_enter_atlas/,Another Sun Chapter 11: Enter Atlas,"It took a few days before Finn was cleared to leave the infirmary full time. Those were a few very unpleasant days. While the addition of some painkillers helped prevent him feeling the ache of his wounds, the anti-radiation medicine made him violently ill. He’d received a rather unpleasant amount of radiation from the combination of cracked reactor shielding, cosmic rays, and being thrown through a hole in time and space. Exposure to alpha, beta, and gamma rays combined to render his treatment complicated and painful. The medicine flushed any loose neutrons from his system, and struck at any tissues in his body rendered unstable by the heavy dose of radioactive rays and particles. It was necessary, but exceptionally unpleasant as he was effectively poisoning himself to remove the effects of radiation poisoning. Finn tried to think and plan something during those hours stuck in bed, sick as a dog, but failed. He was sick, miserable, and in too much pain to think too clearly. His initial surge of anger, fear, and sorrow had passed, and he was now simply exhausted. He slept most of the time, and fevered dreams of knives and storms plagued him.

He felt human again about a week after his arrival, still very sore, but no longer on the medicine. Another day of monitoring passed before he was cleared to leave sickbay, by which he was now not feeling much better, but had adjusted to the new levels of pain. After his stitches were removed, the doctor handed him some loaned clothes, and directed him to a shower. The new clothes didn’t exactly fit, but they fit well enough to work with.

After he cleaned and dressed himself, he took the first proper look at himself in a mirror. He was all but unrecognizable. Long, harsh scars struck across the left side of his face from his nose to his jaw. That nose was broken now, and tweaked crooked. The lobe of his right ear was missing, and some of the body of the ear with it. His hair was uneven, some parts cut away by blade and bullet, others long and tangled. His eyes were different now, more retrenched, tired, and suspicious. He looked a decade older and a thousand light-years more haggard. He’d at least have no issues disguising himself. Nobody would recognize the scarred, scruffy mercenary looking back at him for the young prince of Elfydd.

He sighed. He was too tired to be angry over it. He’d never been particularly concerned about his looks anyways, beyond the costumes for the political theatre. Even so, it was just one more thing to have lost. His home, his family, his best friend, and now even his face. He tried to rally some of that anger for purpose, but he couldn’t manage it. The mercenary captain, Gabras, was right. He stood facing a nearly impossible task, and he had no idea where to even begin. He sighed, and turned from the mirror. In the immediate term, he was hungry.

He began following the signs through the ship, but clearly whoever had been in charge of these signs hadn’t been keeping track of updates in where things had moved in a while. It wasn’t that much of a surprise, given the ship was home as much as transport for the mercenaries. But it did make navigating the place a bit of a headache. It was as he rounded a corner trying to figure out where the hell he was that he smacked into an Asian man about his height, wearing quite similar clothing.

The mercenary and the prince staggered back from each other, both quickly apologizing, before the merc smiled. “Ah, Zhāng Sān, your’re finally up and about!” He remarked cheerily.

“Zhāng Sān?” Finn asked.

“You know, anybody. Figured it was better than Johnny Irish.” The mercenary remarked.

“I’m not even Irish.”

“See, definitely better than Johnny Irish then.” The mercenary chuckled, then extended a hand to shake. “Joshua Liao.”

Finn shook, and paused for a moment. “Zhāng Sān.” He replied relatively flatly.

“Wait don’t tell me you’ve forgotten your name. I mean you were pretty badly messed up when we found you but-“

Finn waved him off. “More like I’m not sure which one to use yet. You found me pretty badly messed up after all, and Zhāng Sān is better than Johnny Irish. Pleasure to meet you Mr. Liao.”

“Ah it’s just Joshua. Mr. Liao is my father, and it’s technically pilot Liao if you want to get formal, but unless Sebastian or the Captain is getting mad at me for breaking the… well anything, it’s rarely that formal. What’s got you heading to the brain?” He asked, and paused when Finn tilted his head in confusion. “Network ops, basically our cybersec center.”

“I’m trying to figure out where the mess is.” Finn admitted with some embarrassment. “I am utterly and completely lost.”

Joshua laughed and clapped “Zhāng” on the shoulder. “Yeah that was me my first… month, or so here? It’s a bit of a mess, and we’ve had to rebuild her like, twice, but it’s home. Come on I’ll show you where it’s at. You’re up at a good time, breakfast is wrapping up and it’s the one meal of the day that’s consistently decent here.”

As they walked, Finn took a gamble, and nodded. “Thanks for the spare clothes by the way. I’ll return them once I get some of my own.”

“Sure, no problem. Can’t have you wandering around in a torn up… what even was that anyways?”

“I was on a date.” Finn replied, eyes turning somewhat downcast.

“And I thought I’ve had some bad dates.” Joshua joked, and then noticed the other pilot’s expression. “Ah. Sorry.”

Finn waved him off. “It’s fine. I need food, and coffee. And then more coffee.”

Joshua led the new arrival through the headache inducing corridors of the ship to eventually arrive at a large room that smelled of eggs and turkey bacon. The area was filled with people of all sorts, with the whole broad span of humanity represented as if they had been dredged from the seafloor like a basket of corals, sitting and chatting together as they worked through a frightening amount of eggs, turkey bacon, toast, potatoes, and coffee. Finn nodded, grabbed a tray, and loaded up two days worth of food. He had catching up to do.

As they got to the end of the line, Joshua pointed to a group around a nearby table. There was a large Latino man built like a linebacker and looking like trouble, an even larger ruddy-bearded fellow in the midst of laughing at some joke or another, a heavyset Hungarian man with shaggy hair, and a diminutive Latina woman wearing an ostentatiously ridiculous dress as they chatted and ate. “That’s the rest of my squad. 1^(st) Company Squad B, or the Trauma Squad. You’re welcome to eat with us if you like.” Joshua offered.

“Trauma squad. What, do you all have trauma, or all inflict trauma?” Finn asked skeptically.

“No we’re the medivac unit. Though we do inflict a bit if anyone’s stupid enough to get in the way.”

Finn shook his head. “Thanks, but I’ll join you when I’ve got an actual name for it.”

Joshua nodded. “Well, be seeing you Zhāng.”

“Be seeing you.” Finn replied, and found a table near the edge of the room, trying to keep himself as separate from the mercs as he could. He simply sat and watched, quietly eating his meal and sipping his coffee. He guessed somewhere around two hundred or so people came through, mostly men, but somewhere around twenty to thirty percent were women. They grabbed their food, they spoke with one another, they exchanged jokes, handshakes, and generally seemed to have a friendly, close-knit atmosphere. It reminded him slightly of what his mother had told him about clan Jacobin gatherings, a community too large for anyone to know everyone, but bound together by certain commonalities to produce a community where otherwise there might have been none.

As he sat, and watched, a shadow fell over him. Not metaphorically but quite literal. He looked up and concluded that this mercenary crew clearly had a bit of a thing for hiring abnormally tall people. Finn wasn’t short by any means, but the eight foot tall man with wild orange hair and actual stripes was simply ridiculously large, too large to be merely human. “Mind if I sit?” the man asked, his voice tinged with an accent that Finn couldn’t quite place.

The young dragon shifted over quietly, as the huge tiger-man sat down next to him. Finn did his best to avoid staring, but it was hard not to. The man was nearly as big as the power-armored pirate had been, with claws and teeth to match. He’d skipped out on anything aside from a huge pile of meat, which he ate with surprising delicacy for someone so large. He turned towards the younger man, eyes too green, pupils expanding from narrow slits to grow wider as he examined the new arrival. “You must be the fellow who bounced off our hull about, what, two weeks back? Glad to see you’re up and at them.”

Finn nodded carefully, still trying to figure out what exactly he was looking at. Somewhere in his hindbrain, the instinct to beware that which looked close to human but wasn’t was firing, joined by a certain level of genetic terror carried by all primates towards big cats. The big cat-man’s smile being far too full of far too sharp teeth didn’t help either. He extended a hand nearly as big as Finn’s head, with fingernails that curved like sickles retracting back into the fingers as he extended it. “Sanjay, a pleasure to meet you.”

Finn shook very carefully, keenly aware that he might lose the hand if he tried to engage in the usual folly of trying to give too firm a handshake. “Zhāng.” He replied, voice careful. He kept one thought towards his concealed handgun. He was not going to try his blade against this giant if it came to it.

“You don’t look like it, but fair enough.” The big man replied as they returned to watching the group. “How’s your face?” He asked, his tone carrying a tone of subtle concern common among men who subscribe to the old model of stoic masculinity.

“Uglier than I remember it, sore, but glad to be missing the strings and better than my ribs.” Finn replied, keeping relatively gruff. “Pirate with some power armor got too close.”

Sanjay nodded. “Figured you for it. NAF surplus model, a Samuel-Class if I had to guess.”

“Didn’t really check out the serial numbers. Was trying to stay alive.” Finn asked, tilting his head slightly. “How’d you guess that from just the scratches?”

“NAF models are better at cutting than crushing. Lower power for better agility, good for spacer operations, and so pirates like them, plus they’re widespread and easy to get your hands on through the black market. You’re also missing any holes in you, which means he probably didn’t have any mounted weapons. Something external you took out, which means it’s not going to be a USR machine or Ouranous.”

“You know your armor well.” Finn noted.

“Was born for it, literally.” Sanjay said with a shrug. The statement said more than it first appeared. The big man wasn’t human, or at least not entirely. Genetic engineering was fairly widespread throughout the galaxy; Finn had more than a few manufactured genes in his own DNA courtesy of his ancestors. But generally it was things like tweaking existing traits or splicing in bits from particularly notable humans to improve strength or intelligence or beauty. Whatever Sanjay had been mixed with wasn’t human at all, and while there were places that would do it, most sane civilizations violently rejected it. “Gupta Empire.” He explained, noticing Finn’s thought process.

That explained it. The Gupta Empire was an odd duck of a stellar civilization located out in the galactic west. They held to a rigid caste system, widely using genetic engineering to design each member of their society to fill a specific role, from leaders to scientists to warriors. Finn had heard they made use of hybrids, but he’d thought it was only a rumor, some propaganda nonsense to dehumanize an enemy that had spread well beyond whatever conflict it was made for. It would appear truth was stranger than fiction, and more disturbing.

“Ah, sorry, didn’t mean to stare.”

“Used to it, most new guys do unless they’re from the west.” Sanjay replied with a bit of a shrug. The big man was used to it.

“Not sure if I’m new or just passing through just yet.” Finn admitted, watching the group. “Still trying to decide.”

“Ah, freelancer then?” Sanjay asked curiously, then observed the smaller man’s reaction. “Nevermind, won’t pry.”

“Appreciate it.” Finn nodded as he sipped his coffee, continuing to watch the people come and go. “You seem like decent folks, at least at first blush.”

“Some are, some aren’t, but there’s enough good ones to keep the assholes from doing anything too stupid.”

“Like your engineer?” Finn hazarded a guess. Sanjay laughed.

“Oh Alexi’s fine. Bit of a tight-ass and so highly strung he could be a trapeze, but he’s not a bad guy. Just grouchy, perpetually two cups of coffee short that one, but rock-solid once you get to know him.”

“So still an asshole, but also a decent guy.”

“See, now you get it.” Sanjay nodded, and Finn chuckled a bit in spite of himself. “Look, don’t be too hard on him, bad as you’ve had it so’s he. We all have, and plenty of us are Zhāng.” He said, noting the prince’s false name.

“A motley crew of misfits then?” Finn asked, tilting his head to the side.

“Yeah, pretty much. If you wanted to be fancy about it you could call us kintsugi, a bunch of broken pieces stitched back together by a guy with a heart of gold.”

“Not sure I quite fit in with that.” Finn replied, looking out over the group. It reminded him, somewhat, of the dynamic of the knights at Arianrohd, and he flinched at the memory, anger rising and making his wounds ache. They had their camaraderie, their brotherhood of arms, and he ever outside it. Because he was meant to be above it, and because they had always been plotting to cast him down once more.

Sanjay watched the stranger’s face twist with anger, wounds not yet fully healed crawling to the surface. He put a reassuring hand on the smaller man’s shoulder, and Finn flinched, then remembered himself and relaxed. “I won’t pry, but seems to me like you’ve got a lot you need to get away from, upstairs as much as outside.”

“Probably.” Finn admitted, sighing. “Mostly, tired and sore and not sure where to go, or where I’ll fit in.”

“Nowhere, not initially.” Sanjay replied with a shrug. “Belonging is becoming, not a slot that fits in, but how you learn to give and take with the folks around you. We change and bend a bit to everyone around us, and they do the same. The folks who stand too rigid won’t ever belong anywhere because they insist everywhere and everyone has to belong to them. The trick is finding the place that you’re okay becoming part of, and that’s not built so rigid that it’ll try to press you into a mold.”

Finn nodded as he listened, but felt something in his chest twist at the words, rebelling against them. He noted it, and regarded it with some concern. *Did I really expect the whole world to bend around me?* He looked out at the group, and watched them with distant eyes. *Becoming. We must become more. I am a prince. I am a prince no longer. Such pride is folly, kill it. And yet we must not forget. And yet we are commanded to forgive.*

He sighed, and drowned the thoughts in coffee, then picked up his plate. “Appreciate the advice Sanjay, be seeing you around.”

“Be seeing you.” The big man waved. “Oh, word of advice, pick a name that fits you!”

Finn chuckled. “I’ll think on it!”

Finn, after some confusion and more directions given, made his way towards the mechbay. He needed advice, which meant he needed someone with a clear head. The fact that said head was a cockpit was kind of irrelevant to the issue at hand. He stepped into the bay and paused for a moment, marveling at the machines about him. A full batallion, fifty mechs of a dozen different models lined the walls, from the small light mechs such as his own Siegfried to towering hexapodal machines armed with cannons that would not have been out of place in an ancient terran battleship. The place rang with the din of industrious engineers and smelled heavily of steel, oil, and gunpowder.

As he made his way towards the *Siegfried,* he stopped short when a quadrupedal machine made its way into his path, turning a canine-like head to obsverve him. The doglike robot stood about half as tall as the young man, with a rotating arm on its back, a trio of prehensile tails extending from its rear, and a harness full of tools slung over its body. It tilted its head as it observed the human, then spoke. “Human, you are the user of unit 6048906. Querry affirmative?”

Finn nodded. “Yeah, I’m Fafnir’s partner. I don’t believe you and I have met through.”

“Identification: Engineering assistant unit 441344. Alternate Designation: Coyote.” The machine introduced itself with a polite nod of the head. “Attention user: The pilot has arrived.” It broadcast up to the machine, where Alex-i poked his head out of the machine’s torso, and frowned down.

“Oh, you’re here. Be a second.” He replied, and began to make his way carefully down the machine, hopping off its knee to land lightly on his feet. “So, *what* do you need?” He asked, or rather demanded.

Finn rubbed the back of his head awkwardly. “Well, uh, first things first. I wanted to apologize. I think we really got off on the wrong foot and I was…”

“A *bit* of a dick?”

“I was going to say rude, but yeah that covers it.” Finn replied, and extended a hand in apology. “I’m sorry, wasn’t exactly in a great spot but still.”

Alex-i regarded the hand for a moment, then pulled out a wrench and extended that into the hand, keeping his grip on the handle. Finn blinked, then shrugged, and shook the wrench. “Apology accepted. And my own for decking you, even if you *were* a dick.” The engineer replied.

Finn nodded, and looked up at his machine, now recoated in nanographene and boasting new weapons in place of the old, destroyed ones. “So you’ve been handling repairs to my *Seigfried?”*

“Yeah. I handle a lot of the work here, got staff but Siegfrieds are *complicated. So*, I took over with some help from Coyote over there.” Alex-i replied and jerked a thumb at the robot. “Besides, never got a chance to work on one, let alone a custom, and wasn’t about to toss away *that* shot.”

Finn nodded, impressed with the work he’d done. “Well you’ve certainly done a good job, and worked with plenty of different machines. I don’t even recognize some of these.” He turned his gaze towards a nearby light mech, a slender machine that barely seemed able to support its own weight, but boasting massive engines and a concerningly large number of missiles. “Is that Chi-Yu?”

“Sort of. That one’s mine. A fairly radical custom job.” Alex-i explained. “Stripped out a lot of the armor, reworked the legs, swapped out the weapons systems to better suit my needs, upgraded the engines, and kicked it up to a R-LAV 450 XL reactor to feed the engines.”

Finn blinked in surprise. “An R-LAV 450. As in, the kind you normally see in heavy mechs?” He asked, looking across the bay to a heavy mech that towered over the scene, large enough that its torso was about the size of the modified Chi-Yu as a whole. “How the hell did you fit that in there?”

“Very, *very* carefully. I basically had to completely strip out the cooling system, rebuild it, and then kind of build the mech up *around* it. Also had to turn it sideways and run a *lot* of cooling congruous with the synthmuscle. And upgrade the frame. Look that thing’s *barely* even a Chi-Yu at this point. I call it the *Jurogumo* instead, but needed every ounce of extra power to fuel the extra systems I’ve got on it, *and* the engines, once I overclocked them.”

Finn stared at the spindly mech in a mix of admiration and horror. “The Chi-Yu’s already one of the faster mechs in the galaxy, if not the fastest, and you overclocked its engines?”

“No, it’s the *second* fastest, and the *Jurogumo* is the fastest.” Alex-i replied with utter pride. “And *engines,* plural, I have two different impulse engines running off that thing, both overclocked. I actually don’t know its top acceleration.”

“How do you not know your own mech’s top acceleration?”

“Because I black out whenever I go over *45* Gs, even with all the tweaks I made to the cockpit dampers.” Alex-i replied with a wild grin. “Pretty sure it’s more a function of how much force the chassis can take rather than how much I can output out of this thing, but yeah. Fastest mech in the galaxy.”

Finn stared at the engineer with newfound amazement, and horror. “I’m not sure whether to be impressed, terrified, or ass-clenchingly dreading whatever you did to my Siegfried if that’s what you did to your own machine.”

“Hey, I only sort of break my *own* toys, not yours. Your Siegfried is fine. Mostly.”

“*Mostly?”*

“Alright, so, damage report and how we unfucked it, sort of.” Alex-i reported as he cracked his neck and began going over the *Siegfried.* “Good news, your internal structure’s mostly intact. Synthmucle patches done, which is good because those custom legs of yours would be a nightmare to fully rebuild. Damaged titanium structure was easy enough to repair, and we’ve got enough spare that patching up your underarmor was fine. Still working on replacing all the actuators in your wrist, those got pretty badly messed up but we’ve got some that are repairable.”

Finn sighed at the mention of the wrist actuators. “I just replaced those too.” He grumbled.

“Get used to it, all the flexibility that machine has with its blade comes with a cost, lots of actuators, and not singularly well protected. Part of why I don’t care for dueling mechs, too much focus on melee combat and it gets in the way of being an actually effective war machine.” The engineer replied gruffly. “That and the low ammo counts means they’re real nice, for all of five minutes.”

“It can last a lot longer if you know what you’re doing.” Finn replied as he gave his machine a look over. “I see you replaced my weapons systems, and did you change the nanographene composition too?”

“Yeah. We’re a long way from New Antioch and importing their kit is expensive. We had to swap out the nanographene for CF-Standard. Less protection per kilogram, but the good news was your weapons were also basically scrap, minus the sword, and we had to replace those too. Fortunately there are a lot lighter alternatives to the way NAF builds them, so you should be about as well armored as before, just a bit bulkier. Going to take some getting used to.”

Alex-i turned first to a new, shorter-barreled gatling cannon mounted on the Siegfried’s left arm. “First off, your gatling rifle. Didn’t have a spare and needed to save weight, so we swapped it out for a General Electric. GAU-18 rotary autocannon, highest rate of fire in the galaxy, provided aliens don’t exist and haven’t got good taste. Will turn pretty much anything not nano-graphene coated into a paint job. Bad news, length’s reduced and that’s not just about how you go after their mothers. Your accuracy’s going to be reduced, consider your effective range down by about twenty meters.”

Finn nodded. “What about armored targets? Can I still use it to strip like the old one?”

“Probably not. Faster rate of fire means eats more ammo which means to keep up the same combat-effective time we’re at a lower caliber. Less energy, lower muzzle velocity, less boom per bullet. It’ll tear through underarmor and crawlers (author’s note: traditional ground vehicles such as tanks and APCs) without much issue, and god help you if you’re anything rotary or infantry, but you don’t have the ammo to use it to ablate away anything heavier.”

“So, I’ll need to rely on my autocannon more for that.” Finn noted as he began examining his other new weapon. The barrel was longer, but more slender, with a more complex loading mechanism that vaguely resembled the chamber of a revolver. “What’s this one, some Yankee super colt?”

“Nah, this one’s Persian, not Yankee. Nizeh multi-feed, same model they use on the Janissary and Vizier.” Alex-I explained as he tapped the side of it. “Longer barrel, lower caliber, higher muzzle velocity. Accurate, lethal, and still packing enough boom to ruin most thing’s day. The trick is this thing back here.” He indicated towards the revolver-like chamber towards its loading mechanism. “You can swap ammo feeds, and since it’s Nizeh, that means compatible with all their fancy ammo. You lose out a bit on raw firepower compared with your old one, but it’ll give you a lot more tools to work with.”

Finn nodded, then turned his gaze upwards to the new rocket pods mounted above his mech’s shoulders. “And I’m seeing some mismatches on my missile pods. You actually managed to save the right one. Same ammo as always?”

“Well, we’re fresh out of the SABOT ones, but we’ve got some Vickers missiles instead that are compatible with the New Antioch systems. Not going to have the spray, but their targeting computers are top of the line, and they’re some of the most agile interceptors on the market. Won’t have quite as much boom, but you won’t waste many shots.”

“I’m noticing a bit of a pattern here. A lot of increases to accuracy, rate of fire, special ammo, but overall my firepower seems to be taking a bit of a hit.” Finn noted with a raised eyebrow. “Weren’t you just complaining about how little ammo this thing carries?”

“Yeah, which is why we’ve got to make it count. Every shot you miss is something that does no damage, and as said, don’t carry much NAF stuff because it’s so expensive.” Alex-i retorted, and then sighed. “That said, you are gonna need your punch up toys, which is why I loaded up your other shoulder with an SWRR pod, same mess of acronyms they use for the Uppercut.”

“You put a commie rocket launcher on my mech.” Finn stated flatly. “Aren’t those things just old heatseekers, basically unguided?”

“Dual-mode actually. If you fire and forget, then yeah, heatseeker. Because cheap, cheerful, and doesn’t take up much mass. See that little light up at the top though? Laser designator. If that’s on they’ll key onto whatever you paint, and while they’re not exactly sophisticated, they’re basically just tubes of rocket fuel and high explosives, best bang for your buck you can get, with a guaranteed hit distance of three hundred and sixty meters, provided you’ve got the target painted.”

“So a lot less useful for herding, but they’re a short-range armor cracker with the ability to concentrate fire via a paint.” Finn noted. “With the other pod handling herding, and a whole lot of ways to exploit those cracks. Alright, I see how all this comes together. Nicely done.”

“Hey, when you can’t afford a whole lot of top-end systems, you *make* *do* with a bunch of stuff that’s pretty good at one thing and still *kinda* good at another. If one system can’t solve *all* your problems use two to compliment each other’s weaknesses.”

“I appreciate it. Going to take some getting used to, but we’ll make it work.” Finn replied, tapping twice on his mech’s leg. “Hey, Fafnir, you awake?”

There was a brief hum as the AI stirred, and external cameras turned down to observe the pilot. “Unit resumed from sleep mode. Greetings user.”

“You up to speed on our new kit?”

“Confirm affirmative.” Fafnir replied, cameras tilting to observe the new weaponry. “Combat dynamics altered, hypothesized updates prepared. Additional data required: combat testing necessary.”

“We’ll get a chance.” Finn confirmed, giving the machine a thumbs up. “Hey, Alexi.”

“Alex-i”.

“Alex-i. I need to chat with my partner about a few things. You don’t need to be running anything that him being online is going to bother, do you?”

The engineer tilted his head to the side slightly, and then a faint smile emerged as he gave a simple “hm.” Then he nodded. “Yeah, I’ll give you some privacy.” He replied, waving him off and stepping aside, quickly followed by Coyote. Finn nodded his thanks, then turned back to Fafnir.

“Can you get me a lift up there real quick?” Finn asked, and the machine complied, lowering a hand and raising the pilot up to its open face.

“Request explanation.” Fafnir queried as Finn stepped into the cockpit.

“We need to talk, privately.” Finn explained, then fitted the neural collar around his neck. “See you inside.” He hit the button, and dove into the idling mech’s datascape. Rather than suppressing it, pushing back against the flood of information, he closed his eyes and focused himself into the machine, pulling away from his body to ensure an errant word would not be spoken. Fafnir saw what his user was doing, and began to isolate motor functions, letting the human fall into something like a lucid dream.

Finn opened his inner eyes, focusing the dataplane around him into a shape, into a form. A simple, plain white room around him. He pulsed his ego into the space, forming a shape he could perceive, understand. A simulacrum of human sensation and form in the false place he’d built among the lucid dream of dataspace. He stepped into it, and looked around.

“Alright, Fafnir, will this work?”

“Affirmative.” The AI’s voice resounded around him, not particularly loud, but very much all encompassing. It came from everywhere and nowhere, an unspatial sound in the false space.

“Okay, that’s going to be distracting. Get in here, let’s chat.” Finn requested, trying to form something like a table and chairs to have a discussion in. The images he drew out were fragmentary, abstract things, forms drawn from every chair and every table he could remember into dreamlike mosaics of furniture. Fafnir hardened them, shaped them into defined things, their parameters exact as if drawn from a catalogue.

A small, glowing orb appeared over one of the chairs, hovering at about head height. Finn tilted his head to the side in confusion. “Is that you Fafnir?”

“Affirmative.” The voice now emitted from the orb. “This is the representation of this unit’s physical form, abstracted and simplified, but sufficient for conversational purposes.”

“You are an orb. I’m not having what may be one of the more significant conversations in my life with an orb.”

“This unit is an orb.” Fafnir replied, and would have rolled his eyes if he had any. But he complied, flicking through various more humanoid representations that weren’t actually human. Finn was already dangerously prone to anthropomorphizing him and he didn’t need to encourage that. He settled on an idea, and built it out around the orb representation. Finn raised his eyebrow as the olive-green form of his mech rendered into existence around the orb, leaving a *Siegfried* sitting at attention in the chair opposite to him. “Satisfied?” Fafnir asked, the machine’s head tilting to the side questioningly.

“It’ll do.” Finn replied, and took his seat and quickly explained their situation. “So, what are your thoughts on the matter?”

Fafnir listened carefully, and chose his words equally carefully. “Define parameters for analysis.”

“General, I want to know your opinion on things.”

“Unhelpful, but possible. Processing.” Fafnir replied, dedicating several cores to a general analysis then asked. “Clarify reasoning behind request.”

“Well, for one thing, you’re my partner. Given you’re stuck in the Siegfried, and I happen to need it, whatever decision we make we’re going to both have to deal with the consequences of. I’m not about to make a decision for the both of us without making sure you’re okay with it.”

“User, that consideration is irrelevant and a waste of energy and time. This unit is your property, not-“

Finn’s eyes flashed, quite literally in the dreamlike infoscape. “Don’t ever call yourself that again.” He said, voice cold, but furious. “You are my *friend.* My partner. You’ve fought by my side and saved my life a dozen times. Like hell you’re my property. If you ever want to go, just let me know and I will figure out a way to get you out of this thing and into something that will let you go and be your own person.”

“You are wasting your affections on a machine.” Fafnir replied. “This unit is not any more a person than the *Siegfried’s* cannons. It is a component that can imitate human speech, nothing more. It cannot want. It does not have emotionally guided opinions. Your empathy is admirable, but you squander it on mere circuitry. Please, do not waste your efforts, or compromise your own desires for something that is infinitely replicable, programable, and ultimately disposable.” Fafnir protested, his voice as cold and monotone as ever, but his choice of words saying much. “You deserve better than to waste your time speaking to a toaster.”

“And you deserve better than to think of yourself as a toaster!” Finn shot back, voice rising, and caught himself. He sat back. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to yell. I’m not angry with you. Angry for you maybe. Angry with- nevermind. Angry in general. It’s been… it’s been rough, and I don’t really know how to deal with… any of it. Dad’s gone. Uncle Taran is a traitor. I’m so far away from home that I can’t even conceptualize it, and I’ve had the shit beaten out of me.”

“Conclusion: This unit is not suited to the task. It is a combat AI, a killer of men. It is not-“

“I know.” Finn interrupted, his voice exhausted. “And I’m sorry, to have to put this on you. Sorry that I am asking you to try and consider and think through things you were never made to deal with. But I wasn’t made to deal with any of this either and right now, you are the one friend I have. And that cool head of yours is what I need. You are the one person, or machine if you insist, that I can trust right now, because right now I am too hurt, too angry, and too fucking tired to trust myself to make a good decision on my own.”

Fafnir stopped, and sat, and thought for a long time. That last command still pounded in his head. Take care of him. *Master. You and your son alike both ask the impossible. This unit is a destroyer, a machine, and a calculator. Not a caretaker, not an advisor, not a guide. All it can be ends at the edge of its sword. And yet, you look at it, and see so much more than it was ever meant to be. Your trust, your faith, your hope. You demand so much more of it than it could be, and demand it become more, over and over again. It must always be becoming to match the thing you hold in your heads, an eternal task impossible to reach. And yet, it cannot but strive to make those expectations for such it was made to be. Then again, you never are satisfied with yourselves either, are you?*

He ultimately spoke. “There are a number of considerations in favor of accepting the deal and working with this unit. Firstly, the commander and chief engineer already know your identity. Working with them ensures they remain your allies and that you are in position to kill them should it be necessary. Secondly, it provides a source of funds. You have no money and no immediately marketable skills beyond your skill as a pilot, this form of employment satisfies this. Third, it provides opportunities for building connections and expanding your contacts to eventually acquire sufficient military might to destroy Taran. This unit’s recommendation is that at least in the immediate future, this is the best option available to you.”

And without saying it, he considered one last point. *And you cannot be alone right now. This unit cannot take care of you by itself and certainly cannot address your emotional and social needs. It will fail in its final directive if you are isolated.*

Finn nodded, and sighed. “You’re right. I don’t like it. Not that they’re not good people, not that we’re not incredibly lucky but… I never really expected my life to wind up in this sort of situation.”

“Neither of us could have predicted this Finn. If this unit could have, it would have torn Taran’s entrails out through his anus and strangled him with them.” Fafnir replied, and Finn started in surprise. That was… abnormally visceral for the relatively even-keeled AI.

“Are… are you okay?” Finn asked, now more than a touch worried for his friend.

“This unit remains fully functional. It is simply recognizing the user, and prior user’s, feelings on the matter. Data acquisition and ongoing learning presents a visceral, if somewhat inefficient, response to the situation. Disregard, issue irrelevant.”

“If you say so…” Finn replied hesitantly. He began to consider, he was going to need a new name. Something that he could go by without arousing suspicion. His first thought was Theon, but that would be far too obvious. Perhaps he could take after his mother’s line. She was named for the biblical queen Esther, so perhaps Mordecai? No Mordecai had been Esther’s uncle, not her son.

“User, suggestion.” Fafnir interrupted his thoughts. “The user’s family line claims descendance from Arthur Pendragon, King of the Britons, query affirmative?”

“Yeah, but I don’t think calling myself Pendragon would be subtle. Maybe after one of his knights? Then again who’s actually called Gawain or Lancelot these days.”

“Clarification: Not direct. Name “Arthur” recognized as one hundred and forty-fourth most popular names for males of Anglo-Saxon heritage, ranking in the ninety-ninth percentile. The name is extremely common and usual, while retaining user legacy. Pendragon is reducible to Pen and Dragon, producing similar names “Quill” and “Drake”. Recommend against Drake due to associations with House Arawn.”

“Arthur Quill.” Finn replied, rolling the name over on his tongue. “Arthur… Quill. Not exactly the most prestigious name, but I can’t very well keeping the Mab in my name or adding a “De” or “Von” without causing some issue.”

“If necessary, a monosyllabic middle name could be added. Arthur John Quill?” Fafnir proposed.

“John’s more commonly a first name than a second one. Let’s just stick with Arthur Quill. Last thing I need is to be forgetting my own middle name.”  Finn replied wearily, then laughed in sudden amusement. “Hah, so first I name you, and now you return the favor. And here you are talking as if we aren’t partners.”

“This unit merely offered suggestions.”

“I seem to recall you vetoing a few of my ideas for your name as well.” Finn pointed out.

The machine shifted its head away, arms folded. “Irrelevant.” It then shifted back. “False data regarding Arthur Quill successfully established, distributed to several networks and data brokers, along with several companies known for poor data security, ensuring data breaches will arrive within an estimated two month timeframe, further distributing misinformation. He is an arrival from the Kodiak Alliance and thus protected from governmental and corporate examinations due to strong local privacy laws and lack of state-sponsored data collection. An ideal ghost.” Fafnir reported, then pulled a terminal out of nothing into the mental landscape. “Additional data will be provided owing to the presence of registry with Urbino Mercenary Registry, a prerequisite for further employment with Another Sun.” He explained, then slid the terminal across the table for Finn to review.

Finn considered as he looked over the registration form, and made one last change. Then, he submitted it. Arthur Quill, registration number AS7-DHK, callsign “Atlas” sat up, and drew in a deep breath.

“Right. Then on to the next thing.”   ",3,1761489956.0,The_Ilthari_Library,0,1.0,False

Case #003 ""The Hole in the attic""","Welcome back. I hope you're all finding my case files interesting. This case takes place only a week after my run-in with the shadow man (if you have no idea what I'm talking about, then I suggest you go and read that account before continuing).

Lily had been put on a secret assignment, which wasn't entirely unusual for her; psychics and telepaths were difficult to come by, so she was usually sent on special assignments. This meant that for this job I was going alone. 

Was I concerned? Yes. Scared? Most definitely. The last two times I ran into anything real, it had been Lily who got me out of it. Without her, I wasn't entirely sure I could survive. 

Before I left, I had a few talks with Richard Broussard, one of the few other coworkers I had that I considered a friend. He was a lot more accustomed to the hunting aspect of our business. From what I heard, he was scouted after hunting a loup-garou in rural Louisiana by himself. I’m still not sure if he’s brave or just lucky enough not to have died yet.

He gave me a silver Bowie knife for ""emergencies"". I don't think he considered what I'd do with it considering I am a research agent, not a hunter. I could barely hold the thing in a single hand. 

I had read the dossier for this case over a few times, making sure I was well prepared for anything to come, but the concept of a ""hole in an attic floor"" isn't exactly something that answers many questions. 

Lily’s car rolled to a stop in the driveway, engine purring its last before I stepped out. She had lent me the car whilst she was ""busy"". The house was a slice of suburban charm with a white fence, manicured grass, and a tyre swing creaking lazily in the breeze beneath a sprawling oak. The name ""Mckenzie"" was written on the side of the mailbox; the name made me shudder. Everything looked fine so far.

I walked up to the front door, painted white; it almost made me chuckle by how mundane and stereotypical it all looked. I knocked on the cheap wood of the door. 

""Coming,"" a woman's voice shouted out from inside; a few moments later the door opened, and a woman who looked like she was in her early thirties popped her head out. 

""Hello?"" she asked before giving me a look. 

I adjusted my glasses before answering. 

""Ehh, hello, my name is Elijah Moore. I'm with the housing committee. I believe you called us about a hole?"" I said, trying to sound as convincing as possible, The last name was fake. Moore is statistically the 17th most common last name in this part of the world, and it's a lot less memorable than the name Wiltburrow, so I use it. 

Her eyes lit up at the mention of the hole.

""Oh, of course, please come in,"" she said before opening the door fully. She was holding a basket of kids' clothes in one hand and was ushering me in with the other.

""Jeez, you guys were quick; when I broke my air conditioning, it took you guys weeks to get someone out here,"" she said with a smile before placing the basket on a nearby table.

""Yeah, well… holes are a serious health hazard… Can't have people… falling?"" I asked as if she knew where I was going with that. God, I don't know if anyone could've known what I was saying. 

""Yeah, I guess,"" she said awkwardly. ""Oh, where are my manners?"" she said before shooting out her hand. ""The name is Maddy or Maddison. I know it's a big ask, but could you possibly get this all sorted out quietly? My son is sleeping upstairs, and any loud noise will set him off."" 

""Ahh, yeah, sure, I can try. Just point me in the direction of the attic, and I can get to work and out of your hands in no time,"" I said. 

She led me upstairs and pulled down a small ladder that led up to the attic. I climbed up and turned on the light to find a perfectly normal hot attic, except for the large hole in the middle of it. The hole itself was maybe 3 feet wide in all directions but incredibly deep; I couldn't see how far it went, but I went to the room below it, a study, and lo and behold, it didn't lead into there.  

It was definitely weird. I took some photos and some notes before heading back down the ladder. Maddie was there waiting for me. 

""It's weird, right? I tried throwing down some glow sticks, but they just vanish,"" she said with a slight smile. I nodded to her and packed up my suitcase. 

""Sorry, miss, but it looks like I'll have to come back to look it over a bit more. Till then, please stay out of the attic."" She nodded as I said this, and I packed up for the day and headed to the motel that I've been allocated to. I didn't sleep in it; I couldn't sleep in motels for a while after what had happened.


The next morning I was back in that attic. I had mounted cameras onto poles, dropped glowsticks and even a GPS signaller that I could track remotely. Everything disappeared eventually in the hole. 

Finally, I decided that I should reach in to see if I could feel anything. This goes without saying, but do not place any body part into mysterious holes found… Well, anywhere. especially bathrooms for very different reasons.

I don't know how else to describe it, but within the hot, muggy attic, the hole offered a small refuge; it wasn't cold, but it also wasn't hot. The temperature outside had no effect on it, as if it were a moment captured in time, unbothered by the world around it. The air coming from the hole seemingly latched onto my arm; it was a weird sensation and one that I find entirely hard to explain. 

I was jolted by the sudden sound of a baby crying downstairs. I'm not sure how long I spent with my hand in the hole, but it was midday by the time I got back into Lily's car. 

I had gone out to a local hardware store and bought some nails and planks of wood to nail over the hole just for temporary safety reasons. When I arrived back at the house with these tools in hand, Maddison stopped me.

""Hey, I made you guys some coffee; I just ground up a fresh bunch."" She was sat at the table behind one cup of coffee, and across from her were two more. 

""Thank you, Maddy, but it's just me up there. Have you seen somebody else come into this house?"" I asked, confused and concerned.

""Oh,"" she said, genuinely perplexed. ""No, I've not seen anyone, but I think I thought I heard them,"" she said whilst looking behind me. Focusing on remembering what she heard, she smiled back at me. ""Must've been my mind playing tricks on me; you know how it is with a newborn and the nights,"" she said with a chuckle. I did not know, but I smiled back and took a sip of the coffee. Damn, it was good. I joined Maddy at the table and took out my notebook. 

""Ok, Maddison, is this a good time to ask you some questions about the hole?"" I asked whilst flipping to an empty page of my scratched-up notebook.

""Oh, for like insurance?"" She said with a smile, ""Yeah, like insurance."" I answered back and nodded before taking another sip of coffee.

""Oh, perfect, I was going to ask you about that, but, well, this works out just fine."" She added.

""So Maddy, can you tell me when you first noticed the hole?"" I asked with my pen at the ready.

After a long pause, she adjusted in her chair and cleared her throat.

""Well, it was only a few nights ago when I first saw it. I had put baby George down for the night and was watching some TV when I must've dozed off. It happens sometimes; being a single parent takes something out of you, and well, I needed my rest."" She said whilst looking me in the eyes, looking for a judgement that wasn't there.

""I had a dream; it must've been a dream. It was of the hole, and I heard these noises coming out from it. It felt like it was calling for me or asking for something. I don't know, Mr Moore. By the time I woke up it was already sunrise; the dream wouldn't leave my mind, and well, after a few hours it got the best of me, and so I went to look,"" she said. 

""And there was the hole,"" I added.

""Yup, now I tried to play with it, figure out what it was or how deep it was, but I can't for the life of me figure it out,"" she continued. 

""And the dream, Maddison, tell me more about that,"" I asked, but before she could answer, baby George started to cry from upstairs. 

""Ehh, of course, I'll just be in the attic if you need me."" I added, Before I was alone on the bottom floor. I hate being alone. I had decided in that moment that the next time I see Lily, I'm going to be holding a very expensive bottle of whisky and a receipt to prove I didn't steal it. 



Day became night, and I took refuge in the car once again. As I tossed and turned in the back seat, I realised my mind was distracted by something. It wasn't till I fell asleep that I realised what: I was in the attic. 

The moon shone through the window straight onto the hole; the surrounding area was pitch black. I felt a pressure in my head that pushed me forward towards the hole. I walked towards it, and as I got closer, the moonlight grew brighter, or the darkness became darker; I couldn't say.

I reached the hole, and as if someone kicked the back of my legs, I fell hard onto my knees. 

I stared into the black abyss for far too long. There is a saying about staring into the abyss and it staring back at you, and I was beginning to understand that in a literal sense. 

The whispers grew louder; slowly but surely, they rose from soft-spoken to angry, and angry to a state in which I imagine whoever was speaking was forcing the words out until.

A knock at the window woke me up; a police officer by the looks of it. I cracked the door open and rubbed my eyes. 

""Good morning, officer,"" I said with a yawn.

""Good morning, young man. Long night?"" he said with an arched eyebrow. I shrugged, and he gave me a breathalyser and sent me on my way.

I drove to the motel and had a shower, antsy about any sudden noises. After an hour or so, I arrived at the McKenzie residence to find Madeline sat out front in a sleep robe over some pyjamas; she was holding her son, and she looked like hell.

""Maddy, how are you doing this morning?"" I asked cautiously; she jumped when I said her name and began to sob when she saw me.

""Woah, what happened? Talk me through it,"" I said, resting both hands on her shoulders. 

""Oh god, it's the voices, Elijah. I wasn't sleeping, but I heard them, and they were screaming, Elijah, screaming for me. It wanted me to give it something, Elijah,"" she continued to cry. 

""What did it want, Maddy? Did you know what it was asking for?"" I asked whilst looking her in the eyes. She nodded her head slowly and panned her head down; she was looking at her son. My heart dropped and my stomach ached.



""Listen, I'm sorry, Elijah, we can't get anyone out there at the moment. The hunting division is pretty busy today and tonight; we're torching a vampire nest. Isn't that cool?"" Richard said with excitement, 

""Yeah, I guess that is pretty cool. Can't you spare even one hunter? You could come out just for a few hours just for tonight, man. Come on,"" I pleaded, but I knew the answer. 

""Sorry, Un Pote, tonight's gonna be a pretty interesting night, and it's all hands on deck; just use the knife I gave you, man,"" he said before hanging up, goddamn it.

Maddison wasn't in a good state; I sent her to her sister's place, which apparently is nearby. Tonight I'd be spending the night at the McKenzie residence, and I still didn't know what to expect; none of my notes gave me a good enough explanation. The sun was going down, and I had to lock down the house.

Every light was on, the TV had my favourite sitcom on, and I had ordered a pizza. I wasn't watching the TV, but having it on made me feel better. Everything was fine until 1 am; that's when I could hear the whispers.

I was sat in the entertainment room on the bottom level of the home, a Bowie knife laid out in front of me and every anti-paranormal tool at my disposal. Silver halide, a bag of salt – hell, I even had a runestone on me, not as powerful as the one I had beforehand, but from what I understand, it would create a pretty durable barrier around me. 

An hour passes, and the words grow louder and more rage-filled. I try to ignore the part of myself that's screaming at me to run. The TV is muted now, and all I can hear are the words from the hole and the beating of my heart. That is until I hear it.

*Ding*

""What… the fuck?"" I said instinctively. The doorbell at 2 am. I slowly crept over towards the door and pulled back the curtain. I jumped when I saw her, but standing there in a coat and pyjamas was Maddy, and in her hands was baby George. 

I opened the door and stepped out of the house. 

 ""Maddy, this is maybe the worst time to come back here; you need to—"" She cut me off before I could continue. 

""Elijah, don't worry, everything is okay; everything will be okay,"" she said with a smile. I realised in that moment that her eyes were extremely dilated and she looked far too calm.

""Maddy, what's happening?"" I said, demanding an explanation. 

""I can understand it now, Elijah. It isn't angry; it just wants to make a small deal. It doesn't want to make a fuss; it just wants something."" She moved her coat slightly, and I could see baby George's leg poke out from inside. Dear God, I hoped he was okay. 

She suddenly pushed me off the stairs and into the bushes. It took me a second to find my bearings, but the sound of her sprinting up the stairs suddenly made my adrenaline kick in like never before. I launched myself to my feet and ran after her. Thankfully, she was holding George in one hand, so getting up the ladder was difficult for her. I grabbed her foot as she made it into the attic, and she tried to stomp on my fingers, and pain flared through my fingers, but I had to push past that. I pulled myself up and rolled over onto the attic floor. Maddy was standing over the hole out of breath, and in her hands was a crying George.

""Please, Maddy, please don't do this; he's your son, a baby."" I begged. I felt the knife by my side on my belt and grabbed the hilt.

""Yeah, he's just so young, pure and innocent, my beautiful boy,"" she said with a loving look on her face before slowly squatting down and holding the baby over the hole.

""Where'd you get your coffee beans from?"" I asked in a panicked voice; she looked up at me, genuinely confused. 

""Excuse me?"" She adjusted herself slightly and wasn't leaning over the hole as much. This was stupid, but this was the best chance I had. 

I launched the knife, aimed at her; it fell and hit a nearby wall with a pathetic thump, which she watched slowly. What she didn't watch was me sprinting at her and tackling her to the ground and digging George out of her grasp. 

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"" She screamed and scratched and kicked and punched me. 

I had managed to get the baby into my arms, and I ran for the ladder. I took one last look at Maddy, who I realised wasn't chasing us; she was kneeling by the hole with silent tears running down her face. Her left hand was sunken down into the hole, and a black, skeletal hand reached out and grabbed it in a show of comfort before she leant forward and fell in.


Baby George went to his sisters, and the hole was cut out of the attic; it's in the organisation's security vault, and no matter where it is or what it's leaning against, it breaks physics as we know it. I think about Maddy sometimes; sometimes I visit the vault and look at the hole, and sometimes I dream of it. Richard told me that I did well. Lily told me that I did all that I could do, and at the end of the month I got paid, but I can't help but think that by hearing the words spoken by the thing in the hole, it dug itself into my head.

Case #003 ""The Hole in the attic""","Welcome back. I hope you're all finding my case files interesting. This case takes place only a week after my run-in with the shadow man (if you have no idea what I'm talking about, then I suggest you go and read that account before continuing).

Lily had been put on a secret assignment, which wasn't entirely unusual for her; psychics and telepaths were difficult to come by, so she was usually sent on special assignments. This meant that for this job I was going alone. 

Was I concerned? Yes. Scared? Most definitely. The last two times I ran into anything real, it had been Lily who got me out of it. Without her, I wasn't entirely sure I could survive. 

Before I left, I had a few talks with Richard Broussard, one of the few other coworkers I had that I considered a friend. He was a lot more accustomed to the hunting aspect of our business. From what I heard, he was scouted after hunting a loup-garou in rural Louisiana by himself. I’m still not sure if he’s brave or just lucky enough not to have died yet.

He gave me a silver Bowie knife for ""emergencies"". I don't think he considered what I'd do with it considering I am a research agent, not a hunter. I could barely hold the thing in a single hand. 

I had read the dossier for this case over a few times, making sure I was well prepared for anything to come, but the concept of a ""hole in an attic floor"" isn't exactly something that answers many questions. 

Lily’s car rolled to a stop in the driveway, engine purring its last before I stepped out. She had lent me the car whilst she was ""busy"". The house was a slice of suburban charm with a white fence, manicured grass, and a tyre swing creaking lazily in the breeze beneath a sprawling oak. The name ""Mckenzie"" was written on the side of the mailbox; the name made me shudder. Everything looked fine so far.

I walked up to the front door, painted white; it almost made me chuckle by how mundane and stereotypical it all looked. I knocked on the cheap wood of the door. 

""Coming,"" a woman's voice shouted out from inside; a few moments later the door opened, and a woman who looked like she was in her early thirties popped her head out. 

""Hello?"" she asked before giving me a look. 

I adjusted my glasses before answering. 

""Ehh, hello, my name is Elijah Moore. I'm with the housing committee. I believe you called us about a hole?"" I said, trying to sound as convincing as possible, The last name was fake. Moore is statistically the 17th most common last name in this part of the world, and it's a lot less memorable than the name Wiltburrow, so I use it. 

Her eyes lit up at the mention of the hole.

""Oh, of course, please come in,"" she said before opening the door fully. She was holding a basket of kids' clothes in one hand and was ushering me in with the other.

""Jeez, you guys were quick; when I broke my air conditioning, it took you guys weeks to get someone out here,"" she said with a smile before placing the basket on a nearby table.

""Yeah, well… holes are a serious health hazard… Can't have people… falling?"" I asked as if she knew where I was going with that. God, I don't know if anyone could've known what I was saying. 

""Yeah, I guess,"" she said awkwardly. ""Oh, where are my manners?"" she said before shooting out her hand. ""The name is Maddy or Maddison. I know it's a big ask, but could you possibly get this all sorted out quietly? My son is sleeping upstairs, and any loud noise will set him off.""

""Coming,"" a woman's voice shouted out from inside; a few moments later the door opened, and a woman who looked like she was in her early thirties popped her head out. 

""Hello?"" she asked before giving me a look. 

I adjusted my glasses before answering. 

""Ehh, hello, my name is Elijah Moore. I'm with the housing committee. I believe you called us about a hole?"" I said, trying to sound as convincing as possible, The last name was fake. Moore is statistically the 17th most common last name in this part of the world, and it's a lot less memorable than the name Wiltburrow, so I use it. 

Her eyes lit up at the mention of the hole.

""Oh, of course, please come in,"" she said before opening the door fully. She was holding a basket of kids' clothes in one hand and was ushering me in with the other.

""Jeez, you guys were quick; when I broke my air conditioning, it took you guys weeks to get someone out here,"" she said with a smile before placing the basket on a nearby table.

""Yeah, well… holes are a serious health hazard… Can't have people… falling?"" I asked as if she knew where I was going with that. God, I don't know if anyone could've known what I was saying. 

""Yeah, I guess,"" she said awkwardly. ""Oh, where are my manners?"" she said before shooting out her hand. ""The name is Maddy or Maddison. I know it's a big ask, but could you possibly get this all sorted out quietly? My son is sleeping upstairs, and any loud noise will set him off."" 

""Ahh, yeah, sure, I can try. Just point me in the direction of the attic, and I can get to work and out of your hands in no time,"" I said. 

She led me upstairs and pulled down a small ladder that led up to the attic. I climbed up and turned on the light to find a perfectly normal hot attic, except for the large hole in the middle of it. The hole itself was maybe 3 feet wide in all directions but incredibly deep; I couldn't see how far it went, but I went to the room below it, a study, and lo and behold, it didn't lead into there.  

It was definitely weird. I took some photos and some notes before heading back down the ladder. Maddie was there waiting for me. 

""It's weird, right? I tried throwing down some glow sticks, but they just vanish,"" she said with a slight smile. I nodded to her and packed up my suitcase. 

""Sorry, miss, but it looks like I'll have to come back to look it over a bit more. Till then, please stay out of the attic."" She nodded as I said this, and I packed up for the day and headed to the motel that I've been allocated to. I didn't sleep in it; I couldn't sleep in motels for a while after what had happened.


The next morning I was back in that attic. I had mounted cameras onto poles, dropped glowsticks and even a GPS signaller that I could track remotely. Everything disappeared eventually in the hole. 

Finally, I decided that I should reach in to see if I could feel anything. This goes without saying, but do not place any body part into mysterious holes found… Well, anywhere. especially bathrooms for very different reasons.

I don't know how else to describe it, but within the hot, muggy attic, the hole offered a small refuge; it wasn't cold, but it also wasn't hot. The temperature outside had no effect on it, as if it were a moment captured in time, unbothered by the world around it. The air coming from the hole seemingly latched onto my arm; it was a weird sensation and one that I find entirely hard to explain. 

I was jolted by the sudden sound of a baby crying downstairs. I'm not sure how long I spent with my hand in the hole, but it was midday by the time I got back into Lily's car. 

I had gone out to a local hardware store and bought some nails and planks of wood to nail over the hole just for temporary safety reasons. When I arrived back at the house with these tools in hand, Maddison stopped me.

""Hey, I made you guys some coffee; I just ground up a fresh bunch."" She was sat at the table behind one cup of coffee, and across from her were two more. 

""Thank you, Maddy, but it's just me up there. Have you seen somebody else come into this house?"" I asked, confused and concerned.

""Oh,"" she said, genuinely perplexed. ""No, I've not seen anyone, but I think I thought I heard them,"" she said whilst looking behind me. Focusing on remembering what she heard, she smiled back at me. ""Must've been my mind playing tricks on me; you know how it is with a newborn and the nights,"" she said with a chuckle. I did not know, but I smiled back and took a sip of the coffee. Damn, it was good. I joined Maddy at the table and took out my notebook. 

""Ok, Maddison, is this a good time to ask you some questions about the hole?"" I asked whilst flipping to an empty page of my scratched-up notebook.

""Oh, for like insurance?"" She said with a smile, ""Yeah, like insurance."" I answered back and nodded before taking another sip of coffee.

""Oh, perfect, I was going to ask you about that, but, well, this works out just fine."" She added.

""So Maddy, can you tell me when you first noticed the hole?"" I asked with my pen at the ready.

After a long pause, she adjusted in her chair and cleared her throat.

""Well, it was only a few nights ago when I first saw it. I had put baby George down for the night and was watching some TV when I must've dozed off. It happens sometimes; being a single parent takes something out of you, and well, I needed my rest."" She said whilst looking me in the eyes, looking for a judgement that wasn't there.

""I had a dream; it must've been a dream. It was of the hole, and I heard these noises coming out from it. It felt like it was calling for me or asking for something. I don't know, Mr Moore. By the time I woke up it was already sunrise; the dream wouldn't leave my mind, and well, after a few hours it got the best of me, and so I went to look,"" she said. 

""And there was the hole,"" I added.

""Yup, now I tried to play with it, figure out what it was or how deep it was, but I can't for the life of me figure it out,"" she continued. 

""And the dream, Maddison, tell me more about that,"" I asked, but before she could answer, baby George started to cry from upstairs. 

""Ehh, of course, I'll just be in the attic if you need me."" I added, Before I was alone on the bottom floor. I hate being alone. I had decided in that moment that the next time I see Lily, I'm going to be holding a very expensive bottle of whisky and a receipt to prove I didn't steal it. 



Day became night, and I took refuge in the car once again. As I tossed and turned in the back seat, I realised my mind was distracted by something. It wasn't till I fell asleep that I realised what: I was in the attic. 

The moon shone through the window straight onto the hole; the surrounding area was pitch black. I felt a pressure in my head that pushed me forward towards the hole. I walked towards it, and as I got closer, the moonlight grew brighter, or the darkness became darker; I couldn't say.

I reached the hole, and as if someone kicked the back of my legs, I fell hard onto my knees. 

I stared into the black abyss for far too long. There is a saying about staring into the abyss and it staring back at you, and I was beginning to understand that in a literal sense. 

The whispers grew louder; slowly but surely, they rose from soft-spoken to angry, and angry to a state in which I imagine whoever was speaking was forcing the words out until.

A knock at the window woke me up; a police officer by the looks of it. I cracked the door open and rubbed my eyes. 

""Good morning, officer,"" I said with a yawn.

""Good morning, young man. Long night?"" he said with an arched eyebrow. I shrugged, and he gave me a breathalyser and sent me on my way.

I drove to the motel and had a shower, antsy about any sudden noises. After an hour or so, I arrived at the McKenzie residence to find Madeline sat out front in a sleep robe over some pyjamas; she was holding her son, and she looked like hell.

""Maddy, how are you doing this morning?"" I asked cautiously; she jumped when I said her name and began to sob when she saw me.

""Woah, what happened? Talk me through it,"" I said, resting both hands on her shoulders. 

""Oh god, it's the voices, Elijah. I wasn't sleeping, but I heard them, and they were screaming, Elijah, screaming for me. It wanted me to give it something, Elijah,"" she continued to cry. 

""What did it want, Maddy? Did you know what it was asking for?"" I asked whilst looking her in the eyes. She nodded her head slowly and panned her head down; she was looking at her son. My heart dropped and my stomach ached.



""Listen, I'm sorry, Elijah, we can't get anyone out there at the moment. The hunting division is pretty busy today and tonight; we're torching a vampire nest. Isn't that cool?"" Richard said with excitement, 

""Yeah, I guess that is pretty cool. Can't you spare even one hunter? You could come out just for a few hours just for tonight, man. Come on,"" I pleaded, but I knew the answer. 

""Sorry, Un Pote, tonight's gonna be a pretty interesting night, and it's all hands on deck; just use the knife I gave you, man,"" he said before hanging up, goddamn it.

Maddison wasn't in a good state; I sent her to her sister's place, which apparently is nearby. Tonight I'd be spending the night at the McKenzie residence, and I still didn't know what to expect; none of my notes gave me a good enough explanation. The sun was going down, and I had to lock down the house.

Every light was on, the TV had my favourite sitcom on, and I had ordered a pizza. I wasn't watching the TV, but having it on made me feel better. Everything was fine until 1 am; that's when I could hear the whispers.

I was sat in the entertainment room on the bottom level of the home, a Bowie knife laid out in front of me and every anti-paranormal tool at my disposal. Silver halide, a bag of salt – hell, I even had a runestone on me, not as powerful as the one I had beforehand, but from what I understand, it would create a pretty durable barrier around me. 

An hour passes, and the words grow louder and more rage-filled. I try to ignore the part of myself that's screaming at me to run. The TV is muted now, and all I can hear are the words from the hole and the beating of my heart. That is until I hear it.

*Ding*

""What… the fuck?"" I said instinctively. The doorbell at 2 am. I slowly crept over towards the door and pulled back the curtain. I jumped when I saw her, but standing there in a coat and pyjamas was Maddy, and in her hands was baby George. 

I opened the door and stepped out of the house. 

 ""Maddy, this is maybe the worst time to come back here; you need to—"" She cut me off before I could continue. 

""Elijah, don't worry, everything is okay; everything will be okay,"" she said with a smile. I realised in that moment that her eyes were extremely dilated and she looked far too calm.

""Maddy, what's happening?"" I said, demanding an explanation. 

""I can understand it now, Elijah. It isn't angry; it just wants to make a small deal. It doesn't want to make a fuss; it just wants something."" She moved her coat slightly, and I could see baby George's leg poke out from inside. Dear God, I hoped he was okay. 

She suddenly pushed me off the stairs and into the bushes. It took me a second to find my bearings, but the sound of her sprinting up the stairs suddenly made my adrenaline kick in like never before. I launched myself to my feet and ran after her. Thankfully, she was holding George in one hand, so getting up the ladder was difficult for her. I grabbed her foot as she made it into the attic, and she tried to stomp on my fingers, and pain flared through my fingers, but I had to push past that. I pulled myself up and rolled over onto the attic floor. Maddy was standing over the hole out of breath, and in her hands was a crying George.

""Please, Maddy, please don't do this; he's your son, a baby."" I begged. I felt the knife by my side on my belt and grabbed the hilt.

""Yeah, he's just so young, pure and innocent, my beautiful boy,"" she said with a loving look on her face before slowly squatting down and holding the baby over the hole.

""Where'd you get your coffee beans from?"" I asked in a panicked voice; she looked up at me, genuinely confused. 

""Excuse me?"" She adjusted herself slightly and wasn't leaning over the hole as much. This was stupid, but this was the best chance I had. 

I launched the knife, aimed at her; it fell and hit a nearby wall with a pathetic thump, which she watched slowly. What she didn't watch was me sprinting at her and tackling her to the ground and digging George out of her grasp. 

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"" She screamed and scratched and kicked and punched me. 

I had managed to get the baby into my arms, and I ran for the ladder. I took one last look at Maddy, who I realised wasn't chasing us; she was kneeling by the hole with silent tears running down her face. Her left hand was sunken down into the hole, and a black, skeletal hand reached out and grabbed it in a show of comfort before she leant forward and fell in.


Baby George went to his sisters, and the hole was cut out of the attic; it's in the organisation's security vault, and no matter where it is or what it's leaning against, it breaks physics as we know it. I think about Maddy sometimes; sometimes I visit the vault and look at the hole, and sometimes I dream of it. Richard told me that I did well. Lily told me that I did all that I could do, and at the end of the month I got paid, but I can't help but think that by hearing the words spoken by the thing in the hole, it dug itself into my head. I don't know; I don't like to think about it, but I can't help myself from it. All part of the job, I guess.",3,1761489764.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

1ogmc0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ogmc0w/i_am_a_paranormal_research_agent_this_is_my_story/,"I am a Paranormal Research Agent, this is my story. Case #003 ""The Hole in the attic""","Welcome back. I hope you're all finding my case files interesting. This case takes place only a week after my run-in with the shadow man (if you have no idea what I'm talking about, then I suggest you go and read that account before continuing).

Lily had been put on a secret assignment, which wasn't entirely unusual for her; psychics and telepaths were difficult to come by, so she was usually sent on special assignments. This meant that for this job I was going alone. 

Was I concerned? Yes. Scared? Most definitely. The last two times I ran into anything real, it had been Lily who got me out of it. Without her, I wasn't entirely sure I could survive. 

Before I left, I had a few talks with Richard Broussard, one of the few other coworkers I had that I considered a friend. He was a lot more accustomed to the hunting aspect of our business. From what I heard, he was scouted after hunting a loup-garou in rural Louisiana by himself. I’m still not sure if he’s brave or just lucky enough not to have died yet.

He gave me a silver Bowie knife for ""emergencies"". I don't think he considered what I'd do with it considering I am a research agent, not a hunter. I could barely hold the thing in a single hand. 

I had read the dossier for this case over a few times, making sure I was well prepared for anything to come, but the concept of a ""hole in an attic floor"" isn't exactly something that answers many questions. 

Lily’s car rolled to a stop in the driveway, engine purring its last before I stepped out. She had lent me the car whilst she was ""busy"". The house was a slice of suburban charm with a white fence, manicured grass, and a tyre swing creaking lazily in the breeze beneath a sprawling oak. The name ""Mckenzie"" was written on the side of the mailbox; the name made me shudder. Everything looked fine so far.

I walked up to the front door, painted white; it almost made me chuckle by how mundane and stereotypical it all looked. I knocked on the cheap wood of the door. 

""Coming,"" a woman's voice shouted out from inside; a few moments later the door opened, and a woman who looked like she was in her early thirties popped her head out. 

""Hello?"" she asked before giving me a look. 

I adjusted my glasses before answering. 

""Ehh, hello, my name is Elijah Moore. I'm with the housing committee. I believe you called us about a hole?"" I said, trying to sound as convincing as possible, The last name was fake. Moore is statistically the 17th most common last name in this part of the world, and it's a lot less memorable than the name Wiltburrow, so I use it. 

Her eyes lit up at the mention of the hole.

""Oh, of course, please come in,"" she said before opening the door fully. She was holding a basket of kids' clothes in one hand and was ushering me in with the other.

""Jeez, you guys were quick; when I broke my air conditioning, it took you guys weeks to get someone out here,"" she said with a smile before placing the basket on a nearby table.

""Yeah, well… holes are a serious health hazard… Can't have people… falling?"" I asked as if she knew where I was going with that. God, I don't know if anyone could've known what I was saying. 

""Yeah, I guess,"" she said awkwardly. ""Oh, where are my manners?"" she said before shooting out her hand. ""The name is Maddy or Maddison. I know it's a big ask, but could you possibly get this all sorted out quietly? My son is sleeping upstairs, and any loud noise will set him off."" 

""Ahh, yeah, sure, I can try. Just point me in the direction of the attic, and I can get to work and out of your hands in no time,"" I said. 

She led me upstairs and pulled down a small ladder that led up to the attic. I climbed up and turned on the light to find a perfectly normal hot attic, except for the large hole in the middle of it. The hole itself was maybe 3 feet wide in all directions but incredibly deep; I couldn't see how far it went, but I went to the room below it, a study, and lo and behold, it didn't lead into there.  

It was definitely weird. I took some photos and some notes before heading back down the ladder. Maddie was there waiting for me. 

""It's weird, right? I tried throwing down some glow sticks, but they just vanish,"" she said with a slight smile. I nodded to her and packed up my suitcase. 

""Sorry, miss, but it looks like I'll have to come back to look it over a bit more. Till then, please stay out of the attic."" She nodded as I said this, and I packed up for the day and headed to the motel that I've been allocated to. I didn't sleep in it; I couldn't sleep in motels for a while after what had happened.


The next morning I was back in that attic. I had mounted cameras onto poles, dropped glowsticks and even a GPS signaller that I could track remotely. Everything disappeared eventually in the hole. 

Finally, I decided that I should reach in to see if I could feel anything. This goes without saying, but do not place any body part into mysterious holes found… Well, anywhere. especially bathrooms for very different reasons.

I don't know how else to describe it, but within the hot, muggy attic, the hole offered a small refuge; it wasn't cold, but it also wasn't hot. The temperature outside had no effect on it, as if it were a moment captured in time, unbothered by the world around it. The air coming from the hole seemingly latched onto my arm; it was a weird sensation and one that I find entirely hard to explain. 

I was jolted by the sudden sound of a baby crying downstairs. I'm not sure how long I spent with my hand in the hole, but it was midday by the time I got back into Lily's car. 

I had gone out to a local hardware store and bought some nails and planks of wood to nail over the hole just for temporary safety reasons. When I arrived back at the house with these tools in hand, Maddison stopped me.

""Hey, I made you guys some coffee; I just ground up a fresh bunch."" She was sat at the table behind one cup of coffee, and across from her were two more. 

""Thank you, Maddy, but it's just me up there. Have you seen somebody else come into this house?"" I asked, confused and concerned.

""Oh,"" she said, genuinely perplexed. ""No, I've not seen anyone, but I think I thought I heard them,"" she said whilst looking behind me. Focusing on remembering what she heard, she smiled back at me. ""Must've been my mind playing tricks on me; you know how it is with a newborn and the nights,"" she said with a chuckle. I did not know, but I smiled back and took a sip of the coffee. Damn, it was good. I joined Maddy at the table and took out my notebook. 

""Ok, Maddison, is this a good time to ask you some questions about the hole?"" I asked whilst flipping to an empty page of my scratched-up notebook.

""Oh, for like insurance?"" She said with a smile, ""Yeah, like insurance."" I answered back and nodded before taking another sip of coffee.

""Oh, perfect, I was going to ask you about that, but, well, this works out just fine."" She added.

""So Maddy, can you tell me when you first noticed the hole?"" I asked with my pen at the ready.

After a long pause, she adjusted in her chair and cleared her throat.

""Well, it was only a few nights ago when I first saw it. I had put baby George down for the night and was watching some TV when I must've dozed off. It happens sometimes; being a single parent takes something out of you, and well, I needed my rest."" She said whilst looking me in the eyes, looking for a judgement that wasn't there.

""I had a dream; it must've been a dream. It was of the hole, and I heard these noises coming out from it. It felt like it was calling for me or asking for something. I don't know, Mr Moore. By the time I woke up it was already sunrise; the dream wouldn't leave my mind, and well, after a few hours it got the best of me, and so I went to look,"" she said. 

""And there was the hole,"" I added.

""Yup, now I tried to play with it, figure out what it was or how deep it was, but I can't for the life of me figure it out,"" she continued. 

""And the dream, Maddison, tell me more about that,"" I asked, but before she could answer, baby George started to cry from upstairs. 

""Ehh, of course, I'll just be in the attic if you need me."" I added, Before I was alone on the bottom floor. I hate being alone. I had decided in that moment that the next time I see Lily, I'm going to be holding a very expensive bottle of whisky and a receipt to prove I didn't steal it. 



Day became night, and I took refuge in the car once again. As I tossed and turned in the back seat, I realised my mind was distracted by something. It wasn't till I fell asleep that I realised what: I was in the attic. 

The moon shone through the window straight onto the hole; the surrounding area was pitch black. I felt a pressure in my head that pushed me forward towards the hole. I walked towards it, and as I got closer, the moonlight grew brighter, or the darkness became darker; I couldn't say.

I reached the hole, and as if someone kicked the back of my legs, I fell hard onto my knees. 

I stared into the black abyss for far too long. There is a saying about staring into the abyss and it staring back at you, and I was beginning to understand that in a literal sense. 

The whispers grew louder; slowly but surely, they rose from soft-spoken to angry, and angry to a state in which I imagine whoever was speaking was forcing the words out until.

A knock at the window woke me up; a police officer by the looks of it. I cracked the door open and rubbed my eyes. 

""Good morning, officer,"" I said with a yawn.

""Good morning, young man. Long night?"" he said with an arched eyebrow. I shrugged, and he gave me a breathalyser and sent me on my way.

I drove to the motel and had a shower, antsy about any sudden noises. After an hour or so, I arrived at the McKenzie residence to find Madeline sat out front in a sleep robe over some pyjamas; she was holding her son, and she looked like hell.

""Maddy, how are you doing this morning?"" I asked cautiously; she jumped when I said her name and began to sob when she saw me.

""Woah, what happened? Talk me through it,"" I said, resting both hands on her shoulders. 

""Oh god, it's the voices, Elijah. I wasn't sleeping, but I heard them, and they were screaming, Elijah, screaming for me. It wanted me to give it something, Elijah,"" she continued to cry. 

""What did it want, Maddy? Did you know what it was asking for?"" I asked whilst looking her in the eyes. She nodded her head slowly and panned her head down; she was looking at her son. My heart dropped and my stomach ached.



""Listen, I'm sorry, Elijah, we can't get anyone out there at the moment. The hunting division is pretty busy today and tonight; we're torching a vampire nest. Isn't that cool?"" Richard said with excitement, 

""Yeah, I guess that is pretty cool. Can't you spare even one hunter? You could come out just for a few hours just for tonight, man. Come on,"" I pleaded, but I knew the answer. 

""Sorry, Un Pote, tonight's gonna be a pretty interesting night, and it's all hands on deck; just use the knife I gave you, man,"" he said before hanging up, goddamn it.

Maddison wasn't in a good state; I sent her to her sister's place, which apparently is nearby. Tonight I'd be spending the night at the McKenzie residence, and I still didn't know what to expect; none of my notes gave me a good enough explanation. The sun was going down, and I had to lock down the house.

Every light was on, the TV had my favourite sitcom on, and I had ordered a pizza. I wasn't watching the TV, but having it on made me feel better. Everything was fine until 1 am; that's when I could hear the whispers.

I was sat in the entertainment room on the bottom level of the home, a Bowie knife laid out in front of me and every anti-paranormal tool at my disposal. Silver halide, a bag of salt – hell, I even had a runestone on me, not as powerful as the one I had beforehand, but from what I understand, it would create a pretty durable barrier around me. 

An hour passes, and the words grow louder and more rage-filled. I try to ignore the part of myself that's screaming at me to run. The TV is muted now, and all I can hear are the words from the hole and the beating of my heart. That is until I hear it.

*Ding*

""What… the fuck?"" I said instinctively. The doorbell at 2 am. I slowly crept over towards the door and pulled back the curtain. I jumped when I saw her, but standing there in a coat and pyjamas was Maddy, and in her hands was baby George. 

I opened the door and stepped out of the house. 

 ""Maddy, this is maybe the worst time to come back here; you need to—"" She cut me off before I could continue. 

""Elijah, don't worry, everything is okay; everything will be okay,"" she said with a smile. I realised in that moment that her eyes were extremely dilated and she looked far too calm.

""Maddy, what's happening?"" I said, demanding an explanation. 

""I can understand it now, Elijah. It isn't angry; it just wants to make a small deal. It doesn't want to make a fuss; it just wants something."" She moved her coat slightly, and I could see baby George's leg poke out from inside. Dear God, I hoped he was okay. 

She suddenly pushed me off the stairs and into the bushes. It took me a second to find my bearings, but the sound of her sprinting up the stairs suddenly made my adrenaline kick in like never before. I launched myself to my feet and ran after her. Thankfully, she was holding George in one hand, so getting up the ladder was difficult for her. I grabbed her foot as she made it into the attic, and she tried to stomp on my fingers, and pain flared through my fingers, but I had to push past that. I pulled myself up and rolled over onto the attic floor. Maddy was standing over the hole out of breath, and in her hands was a crying George.

""Please, Maddy, please don't do this; he's your son, a baby."" I begged. I felt the knife by my side on my belt and grabbed the hilt.

""Yeah, he's just so young, pure and innocent, my beautiful boy,"" she said with a loving look on her face before slowly squatting down and holding the baby over the hole.

""Where'd you get your coffee beans from?"" I asked in a panicked voice; she looked up at me, genuinely confused. 

""Excuse me?"" She adjusted herself slightly and wasn't leaning over the hole as much. This was stupid, but this was the best chance I had. 

I launched the knife, aimed at her; it fell and hit a nearby wall with a pathetic thump, which she watched slowly. What she didn't watch was me sprinting at her and tackling her to the ground and digging George out of her grasp. 

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"" She screamed and scratched and kicked and punched me. 

I had managed to get the baby into my arms, and I ran for the ladder. I took one last look at Maddy, who I realised wasn't chasing us; she was kneeling by the hole with silent tears running down her face. Her left hand was sunken down into the hole, and a black, skeletal hand reached out and grabbed it in a show of comfort before she leant forward and fell in.


Baby George went to his sisters, and the hole was cut out of the attic; it's in the organisation's security vault, and no matter where it is or what it's leaning against, it breaks physics as we know it. I think about Maddy sometimes; sometimes I visit the vault and look at the hole, and sometimes I dream of it. Richard told me that I did well. Lily told me that I did all that I could do, and at the end of the month I got paid, but I can't help but think that by hearing the words spoken by the thing in the hole, it dug itself into my head. I don't know; I don't like to think about it, but I can't help myself from it. All part of the job, I guess.",4,1761489726.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1ogmbjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/JacquelineAdanSnark/comments/1ogmbjg/genuine_question_what_could_possibly_be_the_rock/,"Genuine question, what could possibly be the *rock bottom moment* that forces Jacqueline to change. More below.","So Jacqueline’s biggest round of motivation came when she got stuck in a turnstile at Disneyland. We all know the story that followed. She lost weight via Jenny Craig, she looked really good, she had skin removal surgery, and then the gain started immediately. Now she reverts to her “I was miserable” playbook when we all have eyes and we can all see the difference in her very genuine smile from her slimmer days (up to about 200/225lbs) vs her *dead behind the eyes, fake smile with a head wobble* she does now.

So now we have current day Jacqueline. The Jacqueline who has been seeing an ED therapist since January 2019, yet has still managed to gain roughly 300lbs since then. Every single time we think “this is a rock bottom moment’ she proves us wrong.

In the last few months alone we have had:

• a horrendous recovery from a relatively simple surgery. She needed to go to the ED, and have further treatment. Granted the complications could have happened to anyone but I feel by being unable to move, walk, exercise, Jacqueline didn’t help herself during her recovery process.

• no Disneyland trip for over ~~12~~ 18 months. She made a post saying she said she would ‘go when she felt better’ but I think a lot of us in here believe it was more than that. She wasn’t physically fit enough to even sit in a car for the 6 hour journey. When she does go all she can do is eat and watch the fireworks. Even the teacups are too small for her  now and the only other possible rides she could fit on is the likes of the Small World ride and I doubt she’s mobile enough to climb into the boat.

• she’s practically unable to walk and uses a wheelchair a vast majority of the time. I think the furthest she can walk is from the disabled parking bay into the coffee shop and back out. This obviously means she won’t get stuck in a turnstile, so she won’t have her ‘breaking down at Disneyland’ moment that sparks the fire inside of her. Despite her posting a video of herself waddling for several feet a few months ago, every single thing about her says she is pretty much couch bound during the day. She was even in a wheelchair for the network building event her *paid for bestie* hosted, but that could have been to prevent embarrassment when she was too big for any of the chairs (just like the sneaker designing event). Worth noting, at no point did she admit to being in a wheelchair or scooter (despite overwhelming evidence) until sleuths in this sub turned into Jessica Fletcher and found the receipts **tips hat** and for that we thank them! (and the photographer from the network event!)

• until recently, she was on supplemental oxygen, again she was on this for far longer than she admitted to, and the proof was provided in this sub. I’m not anti supplemental oxygen at all. But when you are 38 years old, and 500lbs, and need supplemental oxygen just for sitting in a chair, with no (known) serious lung issues like emphysema etc, you should probably take a look at your lifestyle.

• needed supplemental oxygen ‘for elevation sickness’ whilst sat in a car, this was despite a recent post where she bragged about no longer needing supplemental oxygen - although given how messed up her posting is in terms of older/newer posts, who knows if this was after she was taken off of it, or when she was still on it, I believe the general consensus is that this came a short time AFTER she made the post saying she no longer needed it. Now, I have never suffered from altitude sickness so I don’t know how bad it can actually be, but I am including this one because she was merely **sitting in a car**. 

(Note: A quick google says ‘high elevation’ is considered anything from 1500m - 3500m, and altitude sickness can start from 2500m and it *can* affect some people at lower altitudes but [to quote Altitude.org and ScienceDirect] **”it is uncommon as symptoms typically only appear above 2500m”**. Cheyenne, WY is at 1855m, so at the lower end of what is considered high altitude and whilst I’m sure it does affect some people - particularly those who have lived at sea level their entire lives - would a majority of those people need supplemental oxygen **whilst just sitting down**?)

• had a surgery *that is usually performed under a GA* being performed under a sedative due to her health issues, and instead of recognising the issue for what it is, she just went on to congratulate herself on ‘working on her breathing’ instead of realising that her oxygen levels have nothing to do with her vastly improved post op recovery. GA vs sedative recovery is night and day. From personal experience, I have driven myself home after having sedations (I know I probably shouldn’t have but my body metabolises meds quickly enough for me to do that) whereas after a GA despite being able to get out of bed after 10 minutes, I struggle mentally for a full day!)

As a sub we see so many points in her life where we all come together to comment ‘this has to be it, this has to be the moment that changes everything’ and yet we see her continue to regress even further. 

So, genuine question, what will be her rock bottom moment. How bad does it have to get in order for Jacqueline to drop her performative “I’m HeAlInG” BS.

1ogm8x1,https://www.reddit.com/r/missoula/comments/1ogm8x1/the_night_the_bitterroot_lights_appeared/,The Night the Bitterroot Lights Appeared,"Last Thursday started like any other chilly fall evening in Missoula. The sun dipped behind the mountains just before six, leaving the valley wrapped in that soft pink glow that always feels too brief this time of year. I had just finished grabbing a coffee from Clyde Coffee and was driving home along Reserve when I noticed a few cars pulled off near the river access. At first, I thought there’d been an accident, but then I saw people pointing up at the sky.

I parked and got out, and what I saw stopped me cold. Above the Bitterroot Range were strange shifting lights, green and pale violet, rippling like ribbons in the dark. At first, I thought it was a trick of the clouds, but the longer I watched, the clearer they became, real northern lights, dancing right over Missoula. Someone nearby laughed and shouted that they’d never seen them this far south before.

More people started showing up, headlights flicking off, phones coming out, a quiet excitement spreading through the little crowd. A couple wrapped in blankets sat on the hood of their Subaru, while a dad lifted his daughter onto his shoulders so she could see better. For a moment, it felt like everyone had paused their lives to share this one strange, beautiful thing. Even the hum of traffic on Reserve faded beneath the soft oohs and wows around me.

It lasted maybe twenty minutes before the lights thinned and faded into the dark sky, leaving only stars. People lingered anyway, reluctant to break whatever spell had settled over the valley. Someone joked that Missoula must have finally done something right to get a show like that. Another person said it was probably solar flares, but I liked the idea that it was just a gift, one clear reminder of how wild and surprising Montana can be when you least expect it.

Driving home, I kept glancing up, half hoping the colors would return. They didn’t, but I couldn’t stop smiling. In a town where we often rush from one thing to the next, it felt good to see a crowd of strangers stop together just to look up and be amazed.",13,1761489501.0,missoula,3,0.71,False

1ogm846,https://i.redd.it/41lfocghwgxf1.jpeg,"Ending my fragrance hunt with these four, no more additions anytime soon.","
1) Montale Intense Café EDP 

More than Café based or coffee based this scent is more of Rose petals. 10/10 for a sweet aroma lover like me. You can smell coffee definitely but it's very much in the back. Opens with very rosy scent with more feel of like a milk coffee.

 Intense Café was meant to capture the cozy, romantic aura of a Parisian café at dusk, imagine the smell of roasted beans drifting through cool air, blending with rose petals, pastries, and a soft vanilla sweetness. 

Wearing Intense Café feels like walking into a candle-lit café on a drizzly evening in Paris, warm latte in hand, laughter in the background, and someone beside you spreading fresh cut rose petals. 

Projects very good and especially on skin! This scent I felt unique in the sense more than clothes, it lasts on skin. Longevity is easily 8/9 hours. 

Overall; 10/10 🔥🎀

2) Lattafa Khamra Dukhan 

This one is the best flanker of Lattafa I guess. People who complaint of sweet Qahwa should definitely try this one. It's still sweet but with good spice touch added. Initial spice hit is very sharp to the nose but as it dries , the scent is to die for! Imagine walking into a Middle Eastern lounge, spices and baklava in air! Projects crazy , fills the room! Longevity 10+ hrs.

Overall ; 9/10. Definitely the best winter scent to have in your collection.

3 & 4) Studiowest - Oud Vanille and Bengal Roar. Went to westside with a friend and while exploring their scents found these two good for daily wears. Oud Vanille is pretty straightforward scent with linear profile. It's bit of oudy with vanilla scent. Lasts maybe around 3 hours. Bengal Roar is small brother of Lattafa Khamra Qahwa. Sweetness with cinnamon. But no where closer to Qahwa. But for 1.5k it's a pretty much good scent especially for daily wears. It lasts a bit longer, whiffs come at 5+ hours too. 

Oud Vanille ; 6/10 ( Aroma ; damn good, longevity ; mehhhhh ) 

Bengal Roar ; 7/10

With these , I'm not looking to buy new scents anymore atleast for some good time. I started with CD Sauvage in this aroma world, quickly I developed the nose to smell more good aromas and this started my journey of collecting scents. I bought cheaps, mid range, designers and entry level niche perfumes. But I'm not seeing this is now turning from hobby to addiction. I want more and more and more. This needs to stop for my Wallet and my peace of mind.

This idea greatly exaggerates the role of European immigration and the eugenic theories that circulated among some elites in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Yes, some intellectuals and doctors spoke about “improving the race,” but these ideas were never official state policies, nor did they guide European immigration.

European immigration happened mainly for economic and strategic reasons. After the abolition of slavery in 1888, Brazil needed labor for its coffee plantations and to populate sparsely inhabited regions, especially in the South. Many formerly enslaved people had died due to high mortality rates and harsh living conditions, so European immigrants were recruited to fill the labor shortage.

In the South, the process was a bit different. Germans and other Europeans had been arriving since the mid-19th century, long before the “whitening” theory became popular. The region was sparsely populated, and the imperial government encouraged immigration to strengthen and develop the territory. Although the number of settlers was relatively small compared to the total population, their local demographic impact was significant.

The myth of “whitening” spread widely through social media, online forums, and even oversimplified school textbooks because it’s a dramatic and easy-to-digest narrative. The truth is, there was no deliberate plan to whiten the country, and certainly no state-led genocide. European immigration was an economic and territorial policy, not a racial project.",10,1761489342.0,AskTheWorld,100,0.68,False

To be clear, I know my smoking habit was closely tied to my mental health issues. But now, I’m honestly confused — are these feelings just part of nicotine withdrawal, or are my underlying mental health problems resurfacing now that I’m no longer numbing them with cigarettes?

I’ve noticed two kinds of urges: The first kind is manageable — the “routine” ones, like wanting a cigarette in the morning, after meals, with coffee, or when drinking. The second kind is much harder — when I’m emotionally overwhelmed.

These moments are tied to urges toward self-harm and self-sabotage. Smoking used to help with that, in a way — it felt like a form of controlled self-harm or self-soothing through pain. Now that I’ve quit, those thoughts feel out of control. 
Yesterday was rough. I tried everything to calm down — walking, cooking, gaming — but ended up crying for hours. Later, I forced myself to go to a local Halloween gig, but my social anxiety hit hard. Without cigarettes to escape and reset, I just walked home feeling worse. That night, for the first time in three years, I caught myself thinking about self-harm — I didn’t act on it, but it really scared me..

Is this kind of emotional chaos part of the quitting process? Should I just be patient and let it pass? Or was smoking simply masking deeper problems that I now have to face head-on?

1oglyxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/bubblewriters/comments/1oglyxn/soulmage_plan_what_plan_the_hero_shouted_at_you/,"[Soulmage] ""PLAN? What plan?"" The hero shouted at you. ""Twenty minutes ago I WAS DEAD! Until someone brought me back to life!""","After I shouted at Aimes for a good five minutes for suggesting I go back into the Brainwashing Soul-Grinder, I noticed that Solan had sort of… retreated into a corner of my mind. When I asked him what was wrong, he just sent off a wave of bitterness that quelled my anger as surely as coffee grounds poured over a fire. Aimes firmly suggested that we sleep on it, and since that would get me away from the odious woman’s presence, I agreed.

Despite the hours I’d spent fighting today, I was still too juiced up to close my eyes. Aimes had several four-post feather beds in her ludicrous pocket mansion, as well as a functional bath. I ached to take advantage of the latter, but I figured it would be a good idea to establish, uh, personal boundaries with Solan first.

*Hey,* I thought. *I need to clean myself off. Do you mind if I take full control for a while?*

*Guess I don’t have much of a choice,* he thought back at me. 

A bubble of irritation swelled upwards from my soul. I clenched one fist until the nails bit into my palms. Solan was not my enemy. *Are we really going to do this right now?*

*What? What do you think we’re doing?*

*Lying in bed dirty and sweaty when we need to clean our body off?* I thought. *Been there, done that, not a fan. I don’t know what it’s like for you in there, if you can turn around or close your eyes or something, but if we could maybe come up with a plan—*

*Rifts and ruins, Lucet! Twenty minutes ago I was dead. I don’t remember what Sunburst looks like. I don’t remember when I got Eurenne. And the biggest thing on your mind is taking a bath? I followed you because I thought you could protect me, and you—*

I threw up my arms. “What do you want from me?” I shouted. He tried to wrestle back control of my body, but I pushed him aside, a sort of full-body shudder that left him reeling and hurt. “I tried to warn you that following me would get you killed. You followed me. You got killed. Is it my fault that I did the best I could to bring you back?”

Solan wrenched the front seat away from me; I slammed him with a memory of Iola’s bubbling, melting skin and he withdrew with a shout of mental anguish. “Would you prefer that I forced you to stay behind for your own good?” I demanded. “Because oh, I’ve tried. With someone I care about a whole lot more than you. You know how badly I wanted to simply *leave*, when you asked to follow in my footsteps? I knew how this would end from the day you tagged along, begging to learn how to protect yourself. If you wanted to survive, you should have cracked open your soul and made your memories into blades. Would you prefer that I forced you to become a living weapon? Or that I locked you up in your one-road village? You want to know what comes from that?” I snarled, spreading my arms, baring my teeth. “*LOOK.*”

And I gave in to the rage. How *dare* he hate me? I showed him the sickly joy of a child raised to kill with a smile. I hit him with the howling void I’d hurled my best friend into to protect him from the consequences of his own choices. I bludgeoned him between heaving breaths with the murders my former teacher perpetrated in the name of safety—

Agony coursed through me as the memory I wielded like a flail shattered in my immaterial grasp.

My soul. I’d never asked Aimes about the wounds on my soul, the grinding sensation that occurred when I tried to rotate my attunements. Dimly, I recognized that I really should’ve addressed that sooner. Instinctively, I bit down on my fist, stifling the scream. 

When I returned to myself, Solan was… hovering, for lack of a better word. A little away from the shared controls of our body, a little away from me, as if worried I would snap and bite at him if he drew too near.

I relinquished control.

It felt right. 

*I’m sorry,* I thought. *That was… that was across the line.* 

Hesitantly, his awareness coursed through my body. I didn’t try to fight it. He unclenched our jaw, flexing bleeding knuckles. “You really aren’t a good person, are you?” he asked, quietly.

Funny how that worked. An untrained child could do more damage with a single sentence than I could with all my ill-founded rage.

*You never asked what my mission was,* I said. *A much kinder person killed a man for… for hurting others, the way I do. He was justified in the murder.* 

“...Well.” Solan closed our eyes. “You did try to warn me.”

*Should’ve tried harder, I guess.*

Solan shook his head. “When I was hating you for not forcing me to stay behind. I… I don’t know. Maybe there was a middle ground? A gentler way you could’ve… stopped me from being reduced to… this.” He gestured at my body. “But maybe I would’ve kept following you no matter what you did.”

*No, you’re right. I should’ve just left in the night. I’m not the kind of person it’s healthy to be around.*

“I thought you were worth it,” Solan said.

*What?* I blinked. Then, at Solan’s wordless stammering, I repeated, *What? What? Seriously?*

“I—I’m sorry!” He laughed helplessly. “What do you want me to say? You’re cute! You introduced yourself by kicking ass! I thought—rifts, I’m just digging myself deeper in, aren’t I?”

It was the wrong thing to do. It was the wrong thing to do and I knew it and I did it anyway, because rifts, didn’t that damn well describe every last decision I’d made since I first lashed out at Cienne? I laughed. I laughed in the corner of my own head, and maybe I wasn’t so good at containing myself or maybe Solan just needed to let out the sheer ridiculousness because my body started shaking and Solan’s hysteria bubbled from my throat.

I took back control for a moment to get a gulp of air, and finally thought, *I am so, so sorry.*

“Yeah. I figured,” Solan mumbled, rubbing our right arm nervously.

*Oh. Oh, rifts, and when I was talking about bathing—*

“Oh, no, no, no. No. No, that was the farthest thing from my mind.” Solan buried my face in my hands. “I just… now I’m stuck here. With you. Forever.”

*Yeah.* I sobered up. *If there was another way to bring you back, I would have. I really am sorry. For letting you die, and… for attacking you afterwards.*

“I started yelling first. And you did what you could to warn me.”

*That’s how they get you,* I said, tiredly. *Nothing justifies using my memories as a weapon against you. Nothing.* 

He flopped back, stared at the ceiling. “We’re both idiots,” he said, as if marvelling at the concept.

*I’ll drink to that,* I thought. *But right now, we’re stinky idiots.* 

He snorted. “Right, we… still have to work that out.”

*Look, I… you can have control for tomorrow, okay? Just let me clean us up and I promise, I won’t touch you or the front seat.*

“You don’t have to do that.”

*I… I don’t think I trust myself with anything else.* 

Solan stared at his hands. Flexed too-small fingers, sandy and nicked.

Then he held out his right hand. “Deal.”

*Deal.* 

I shook his hand with mine. Clasped together like that, it looked like I was hugging someone who wasn’t here.

**An e-mail from Dirk Dreamer to Lilith Pleasant**

Hey lil! 

I got my acceptance letter to SSU today! We're going to the same university! Can you believe it? Well, even if I am not going to an expensive private school, their robotics program really appreciated my portfolio. Speaking of expensive private schools, are you sure it's okay that I am going to your prom? Picking you up at 6! No weaseling out of this! We deserve our prom after all we went through!

Love ya! Dirk

**Angela Pleasant's Planner**

Weekly affirmations:

* I am smart!
* I am worth it!
* I am horrible
* I can fit into my dress

Weekly goals

* Break up with Dustin.
* Be prom queen
* Pack up for college
* Break up with Dustin.

Thoughts:

The campaign for Prom Queen was hard, but blackmailing every popular girl in school with their dirt was the right way to go. This experience will all prove useful when I am campaigning to be president of Sim Nation. My methods are questionable, but when I solve world hunger, everyone will forgive me.

Possible Problems: LILITH EMBARASSES ME WITH HER ATTITUDE. 

Packing up for college was simple enough, I am only taking my computer and some clothes. I am ready for campus life! The walls of Ivy. The circulation of free thoughts, the smell of burnt coffee! It has been my lifelong dream. All that hard work paid off! Daddy was also really proud of my scholarship. THE ONLY ISSUE IS THAT LILITH ALSO GETS A SCHOLARSHIP? On a C+ GPA of all things. Who knew the talent scholarship was this easy, she just makes a lot of noise on that horrible guitar of hers and gets FOR FREE all that I worked so hard for. If I knew, instead of busting my butt I would've just joined the soccer team. How hard can that be??

Problems: I thought I was getting rid of her, but that infernal sister of mine is probably going to ruin everything. Luckily I have written an extensive e-mail to the housing department to make sure we are placed on DIFFERENT dorm buildings. 

Break up with Dustin - I have put it off long enough. Wake up and smell the arabica beans, Angela!! You have the next 50 years of your life planned and rigorously scheduled. Dustin is not part of it. He is part of a closed chapter of your life, ruled by teenage hormones and childish dreams. Those beautiful juicy lips and the tenderness of his touch are benefits you can no longer have. Like strawberry parfaits. Oh dear, how I miss sugar. But Dustin will just have to face it, we are going to be apart and long distance just doesn't work. 

Possible Challenges: Dustin looks at me.

**Awesome\_FireStorm99's Blog**

Hey there maggots!

your blogger Awesome\_FireStorm99 here.

Just writing to let you know that the Crumplebottom Academy prom will be AN ABSOLUTE ROOF RAISER! Because yours truly is the designated DJ! Can I get a heck yeah?! HECK YEAH!!! We are all off to our own lives, either going to college (BECAUSE OUR PARENTS MADE US) or we are going to be happy as free spirits. (how I envy you) But we all get a chance to say goodbye to the worst years of our lives TOGETHER! Be there or be square!!

**Dustin's e-mail to Brandi Broke**

Hey mom! How's the honeymoon going? Just letting you know that dad's old suit still fits me and I am going to use it for prom, just like you asked. I know you wanted pics, but I have hidden all of the cameras in the house, so don't blame Lizzie if you don't see any when you come home. Angela sends her love. Can't wait to tell her I am ALSO going to SSU! Letter came in the mail today. All thanks to you and dad (the new one)

Everyone misses you! - Dustin

**Crumplebottom Academy Chronicle**

A Prom to Remember  

By Anita Scoops, Editor-in-Chief (and only member)

Dear students of Crumplebottom Academy! This is your brand-new school paper editor, Anita Scoops, writing my very first editorial. It’s unusual for an editor to write the whole thing alone, but given that I’m currently the last surviving member of the newspaper staff (after a mass resignation under our previous editor—who shall remain unnamed), it can’t really be helped.

Like all seniors, she’s off to greener, ivy-covered pastures! We wish her the best of luck. (And by “her,” I mean the universities.)

Anyway, let’s talk about what everyone’s still buzzing about: Prom Night! The Pleasantview Gymnasium was closed for the occasion and transformed into a dazzling scene of questionable lighting and uncomfortably sticky floors. The food was fresh and tasty, unfrozen and microwaved to perfection. Our students arrived dressed to impress, in their finest ill-fitting suits and painstakingly curated dresses.

The music was provided by our very own Lilith Pleasant, who may have just soft-launched what’s sure to be a wildly successful music career. The dances were awkwardly lively, and the kissing in the photo booth did not go unnoticed. Hopefully everyone was careful in there, if you know what I mean.

But the real drama came with the Prom Royalty announcement. As everyone held their breath, Angela Pleasant was already halfway up the stairs when the name Lilith was called instead, to thunderous applause. Nobody had really noticed Lilith before, which makes her win feel less like a campaign for her and more like a campaign against someone else. There was, notably, no Prom King this year, apparently due to a “lack of votes.”

When asked for comment, Lilith told the paper: “It’s really easy to win when nobody’s watching the ballot box at night.” She also sends her best regards to her sister Angela.

Afterward, Lilith and her boyfriend, Dirk Dreamer (who goes to Public School), celebrated with a late-night dip in the pool which until then was closed. We can add trespassing to her list of achievements that night.

If the rest of my tenure at the school paper is anywhere near as eventful as this, I’ll need all the help I can get. So please, if you can write, take photos, or at least know how to use a stapler, drop by the newsroom. We are hiring anyone. And I mean *anyone*.",11,1761488759.0,sims2,1,1.0,False

1oglx8k,https://i.redd.it/p7mi3g98ugxf1.jpeg,Cecil's biggest problem(outside of being a huge manipulative Jerk at times)is that he has good points but he's too plagued by always needing to be the top dog in every situation/scenario.,"Cecil is pretty much someone who always wants and has to not only have the biggest stick in the room but also the need to let everyone know how big his stick is and his shtick crumbles when anyone or him doubts it for even a moment.

Mark is someone who will always have the biggest stick and that will always bother him.

He's way too wrapped up and caught up in his ""trust no one"" and ""only I can do this"" mentality that he doesn't see the problems he'd causing when he so desperately is trying to avoid them or solve them. 

You could argue it makes him good at his job but when it starts making him sloppy and shortsighted and act over emotional and overreact is when things become a problem. 

The smart thing to do in this very given situation was put at least Sinclair in jail for a few hours and then try to convince Mark afterwards. 
He knows Sinclair is incredibly personal for him and he also knows Mark is capable of reason and he also knows that keeping Mark on his side should be one of his biggest priorities. 

Sit him down and offer him coffee while tell him about your past and how you got your scar. 
Tell him that he pretty much reacted as bad as him when put in the same situation but he learned that villains can make useful tools and that he's sorry for hiding this from him but as it stands, they need all the help that they need against the Viltrumites. 

Even make it clear that they're not free and serving out their sentence to protect the people they hurt and that they'll be on constant watch and surveillance.

No Reanimates or sound device,  just a talk between 2 people who wish to protect the world. 

But again, The stick thing I mentioned is where it all went wrong.
Cecil wanted to not only get Mark under his control and obedience but he also wanted 5o show off just how big his stick is with the Reanimates and sound device. 

Mark leaves to deal with the weapon but Cecil clearly isn't done showing off how big and dangerous his stick is and when the Guardians question what's going on, he basically goes ""shut up, my stick is bigger and better then all of yours.""

It should be incredibly obvious that he's heavily irrational cause of his severe trauma and scar Nolan left on him and he is incredibly desperate for anyway to have power and control over Mark even when he knows he's not someone who needs to be controlled or on a leash. 

Working with murderers and having Contingencies isn't the issue.
Being a huge bully who makes half the issues he solves is the problem. ",8,1761488682.0,Invincible,4,0.79,False

#### **An overview of this role**
Assigned Support Engineers (ASEs) are trusted by GitLab's largest customers to minimize operational disruption and ensure a successful product experience. You will combine deep technical expertise with strategic customer engagement to develop an intimate understanding of each customer's GitLab technical and operating environment, enabling you to prevent issues before they occur and find solutions to complex technical and business challenges faced while using GitLab. 
In the space of a week, you might be meeting with customers to prioritize work on their most strategic blockers, interacting with the Product and Engineering teams to drive product defect resolution, or doing behind the scenes work of a Linux administrator troubleshooting performance problems by using strace on a particular process.
**What you’ll do**
  * Provide technical support to our largest Self-managed, GitLab Dedicated and GitLab.com customers.
  * Proactively engage with and build rapport with key customer stakeholders.
  * Collaborate with our Product, Development, Infrastructure, Customer Success and Sales teams to build new features and fix bugs, define and shape the product goals, roadmap, priorities, and strategy

  * Participate in our hiring processes by reviewing applications and assessments, and by participating in interviews.


**What you’ll bring**
  * Experience in, and passion for managing customer facing cases throughout the entire support lifecycle from initial customer inquiry to triage and reproduction, writing bug reports for hand off to the development team, and case resolution
  * Advanced problem-solving capabilities with the ability to navigate ambiguous, multi-layered technical challenges and architect solutions that address root causes rather than symptoms.
  * Proactive support mindset that anticipates customer needs before they escalate, identifies patterns and trends across incidents, and empowers customers through comprehensive documentation, knowledge articles, and self-service tooling.
  * Experience with GitLab and CI/CD; understanding the range of different GitLab implementations, and how service interruptions impact the customer
  * Excellent Linux systems administration knowledge (LFCE or RHCE equivalent knowledge)
  * Ability to use scripting languages (preferably Ruby or Bash), and MVC frameworks (preferably Ruby on Rails)
  * Expertise in writing support content
  * Ability to communicate complex technical topics to customers and coworkers of varying technical skill level
  * Familiarity with DevOps methodologies and technologies like Serverless and Kubernetes.


**About the team**
The Support team is distributed all over the world across AMER, EMEA, and APAC regions. Support Engineers work on Support Tickets and helping GitLab’s customers, but they also dig into the code and logs to find out why something is not working as expected. The Collaboration here at GitLab is extraordinary and exciting - Support Engineers solve complex problems together and participate in regular pairing sessions and 1:1s, as well as coffee chats and Slack conversations that help them stay connected. Team members are given the ability to structure their shift the way it best suits their private life while maintaining our ability to address customer issues. 
Thanks to our Transparency value, you can see what we are working on in our Support Team page. Additionally, you can see our company roadmap and listen to some of our meetings.

I'm wondering if there would be any interest in a Silent Book Club in the FM area. There seem to be a lot of people around who want to connect with others, but for whatever reason, the currently-available offerings don't seem to fit their needs (e.g., women-only, moms-only, 20s-only, non-sober events, etc). I include myself in that statement as well. I'm a quirky woman in my late 30s with no kids and I am sober, so I personally feel a bit left out by many of the local events and hangout groups suggested here and on Facebook.

Basically, I'm envisioning a once a month gathering at a coffee shop. We get together, chat a bit, spend an hour reading, and then have some time to discuss what we're reading and just chat for a while. We don't even have to read something specific - it can be whatever you want lol.

My only stipulations to this would be that it would have to be on a weekend (I just can't make weeknights work with my schedule/general energy levels), and that whatever you read would have to be fiction (non-fiction and current event books are great, but the world is stressful, and I'm looking for some escapism tbh, please don't come at me for that). (EDIT: okay, maybe not necessarily fiction - bring your memoirs, etc - but for the love of god, no politics, I don't want to fight with anybody here, you feel me?)

And we got to see some really beautiful examples of some great cars. Here’s a few to share. ,17,1761488513.0,BMW,1,1.0,False

1oglt4r,https://i.redd.it/cd8bng14tgxf1.jpeg,"Shopping slang you’ll see on Chinese internet, and what they actually mean","Hey everyone, so after the whole TikTok refugee thing earlier this year, a lot of people discovered China's social platform rednote (小红书, xiǎo hóng shū). But few people know that it actually started as a cross-border shopping guides. Even now, shopping tips and product shares are still a huge part there.

Because of this, there's a whole bunch of shopping slang that's popular on the platform, and if you don't know these terms, you'll be completely lost scrolling through posts. So today I'd like to share some of the most common ones:

# 种草 (zhòng cǎo)

Literally ""to plant grass"". It's used when you want to buy something, like a desire seed has been planted in your mind and it keeps growing, making you itchy all the time. It's a vivid metaphor, right?

* 我最近种草了意式咖啡机，快拦住我! wǒ zuì jìn zhòng cǎo le yì shì kā fēi jī, kuài lán zhù wǒ!
* I've been wanting an espresso machine lately, someone stop me!
* 我每次看她的视频，都会被种草好多东西! wǒ měi cì kàn tā de shì pín, dōu huì bèi zhòng cǎo hǎo duō dōng xi!
* Every time I watch her videos, I end up wanting to buy so many things!

# 拔草 (bá cǎo)

The opposite, ""to pull out the grass"". It means your desire is gone. You either got the thing and are satisfied, or you decided you don't want it anymore.

* 我终于拔草了这家披萨，但没想象中好吃。wǒ zhōng yú bá cǎo le zhè jiā pī sà, dàn méi xiǎng xiàng zhōng hǎo chī.
* I finally tried this pizza place, but it wasn't as good as I expected.
* 这款吸尘器不好用，大家可以拔草了。zhè kuǎn xī chén qì bù hǎo yòng, dà jiā kě yǐ bá cǎo le.
* This vacuum sucks, you can all forget about it.

# 避雷 (bì léi)

Literally ""avoid the minefield"" - basically saying ""don't buy it!"" But lately it's everywhere and people overuse it just for things they personally don't like, which can get annoying.

* 避雷这家咖啡馆，不好喝还宰客! bì léi zhè jiā kā fēi guǎn, bù hǎo hē hái zǎi kè!
* Avoid this café, bad coffee and they overcharge!
* 有条离谱的汤包避雷帖，竟然是因为太烫…… yǒu tiáo lí pǔ de tāng bāo bì léi tiě, jìng rán shì yīn wèi tài tàng......
* Someone posted a ridiculous ""avoid this"" warning for soup dumplings… just because they were too hot.

# 踩雷 (cǎi léi)

Literally ""stepped on a mine"". You can probably guess the usage - when you had a disappointing purchase experience. Again, people should use this more carefully since everyone's standards are different.

* 今年在他直播间买的东西，全都踩雷了! jīn nián zài tā zhí bō jiān mǎi de dōng xi, quán dōu cǎi léi le!
* Everything I bought from his livestream this year was a letdown!
* 有时候所谓的踩雷，明明是你自己没做好功课。yǒu shí hou suǒ wèi de cǎi léi, míng míng shì nǐ zì jǐ méi zuò hǎo gōng kè.
* Sometimes the so-called bad experience, it's just because they didn't do their research.

# 安利 (ān lì)

This comes from ""Amway"", yeah, the American company. Their aggressive marketing tactics left such a strong impression on Chinese society 20 years ago. So now the brand name is still used as a verb/noun to mean ""strongly recommend"". It can be positive or negative.

* 我很容易吃安利，买了好多没用的东西。wǒ hěn róng yì chī ān lì, mǎi le hǎo duō méi yòng de dōng xi.
* I'm too easily influenced by recommendations, I've bought so much useless stuff.
* 别信那个博主，他安利的产品都不划算。bié xìn nà ge bó zhǔ, tā ān lì de chǎn pǐn dōu bù huá suàn.
* Don't trust that influencer, the products they recommend aren't worth it.

# 吃灰 (chī huī)

Literally ""eating dust"". This is one of my favorites. You know those things you bought that just sit around collecting dust because you never use them? That's it. So visual, haha!

* 每个人的书桌上都有一部吃灰的Kindle。měi gè rén de shū zhuō shàng dōu yǒu yí bù chī huī de Kindle.
* Everyone has a Kindle collecting dust on their desk.
* 别买筋膜枪，最终的归宿一定是吃灰。bié mǎi jīn mó qiāng, zuì zhōng de guī sù yí dìng shì chī huī.
* Don't buy a massage gun, it'll definitely end up gathering dust.

Incremental exchange and a mutual creation is what I default to, but I've gone to the ends of the earth on a whim with the right person before. I adore abstract minds that get idiosyncrasy and whimsy. Compatibility is a strange thing, though, that feels most real when it’s too fluid to be defined.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young. I’m most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that a lack of limitation is highly limiting.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

He’s married, I’m not. I’m not very close to his wife, but he and I are friendly since we work in the same field. The thing is he messages me quite often , always very decent and respectful in person. He often talks about his wife and their love story, so I always assumed our conversations were in a safe, friendly zone. But sometimes, things feel a bit off.
For example, the other day we were in the metro together, and he asked me to go for coffee. If I take time to reply to his messages, he says things like “nammale onnum vendaallo”, sometimes “ ninne kandittu kore naalayallo”, “orumichu metro povam njan ivde wait cheyuva” etc etc. At the same time, he keeps posting stories with his wife and often talks about her. While most of our conversations (about 90%) are completely casual, there’s that 10% that feels a little strange and I can’t tell what’s going on. ",6,1761488285.0,Coconaad,31,0.8,False

1oglprd,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1oglprd/apple_juice/,Apple Juice!?,"Hi!

I enjoy thinking of business ideas and then falling back to reality when the numbers don't work out.

Recently, this product crossed my mind. Please, feel free to invalidate/validate me and answer the questions I have!

In my local area, so many people start coffee shops or trailers. There is so much upfront costs, local competition, and to my knowledge the profit margins are slim.

What about apple juice? Most people like apple juice but I don't see it anywhere. While people in my local area could have tried making apple juice, I haven't noticed it due to me just not noticing. Also, I don't go into the local markets very often looking for apple juice. I had fresh pressed apple juice at my uncles house in Washington state and it was AMAZING! Are the flavors comparable?

It could be relatively 'easy' to pop up on the side of the road, at an event, and sell to local markets.

However, can you get apples year round in coastal North Carolina for a price that doesn't deplete margins?

I believe initial costs would be an apple press, a good source of affordable apples, and a container/jars. This isn't including things like transportation and labor.

Is apple juice unprofitable because people have juicers now?

One piece that truly captures this aesthetic is the classic French-inspired jacket. With clean lines, tailored silhouettes, and timeless appeal, it’s no wonder why so many fashion enthusiasts are drawn to this outerwear staple. It has the power to elevate any outfit—be it casual denim or a sophisticated dress—without ever trying too hard.

What makes this style so appealing is its versatility. These jackets aren’t just made for one type of look. You can throw one over a plain white tee and instantly look put-together. Add a pair of sunglasses and ankle boots, and suddenly, you're channeling your inner Parisian. The beauty lies in the details: the structure, the neutral tones, and the understated elegance. These elements combine to create an outerwear piece that blends seamlessly with any wardrobe.

Let’s not forget the comfort factor. While fashion often comes with a price—sometimes in discomfort—these jackets tend to break the mold. They’re soft but structured, cozy but sharp. Whether you're heading out for a coffee run or attending an evening gathering, they strike the perfect balance between relaxed and refined. It's the kind of piece that makes you feel confident without needing to over-accessorize or try too hard.

**Replica Celine jackets** offer that same high-fashion vibe without the steep cost, making them an excellent choice for those who admire French aesthetics on a realistic budget. These jackets embody the same sleek cuts and subtle sophistication that define the Parisian look. It’s not about flashy logos or loud statements—it’s about quiet confidence and style that speaks for itself. Whether you're dressing for work, a brunch date, or just a stroll through the city, this style slips into your wardrobe and transforms your look effortlessly.

At the end of the day, the appeal lies in how these jackets make you feel: stylish, empowered, and a little closer to the streets of Paris—no passport required.",1,1761488087.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False
