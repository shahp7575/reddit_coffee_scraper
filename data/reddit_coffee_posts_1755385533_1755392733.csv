1msdej8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1msdej8,Chair size and general help!,"I got this new chair for my living room from fb marketplace and even though I measured, it's a lot bigger than I thought and significantly higher than the couch. Is it too large? Any tips about the rest of the room. Some things I'm already planning on changing:

- new coffee table, I do not like this mirrored one but unsure of what to get. Maybe a small ottoman/foot stool for the couch and circular teak coffee table? 
- need to shift the rug
- new curtains or natural wood blinds
- some other plant stand than what is there
- I know my TV is huge but it was free! 
- eventually a different media console/credenza

Would love any feedback, I've been piecing everything together from thrift stores/fb/neighborhood sales so it's a hodgepodge! ",2,1755392475.0,HomeDecorating,0,1.0,False

NeverMore

For as long as Christina Ricci’ a forty five year old brown eyed, dark haired girl, Having the attitude to match. Her gothic charm, that was all about her, a charm that set her apart from other girls. But for as long as she could always remember, remember having a fascination for dark mysterious men. Men that would often leave her in the dark a place that was often familiar with her. As the wind blew through her dark hair blowing it in and around her face. While hearing the sounds of the Raven off in the distance beckoning to her saying to her for

NeverMore 

On this night never shall you find yourself desiring another for NeverMore no other shall know you. With Christina’ Often finding herself just wanting to be alone, finding herself often alone in the dark. Looking for more, more than she would often find in her life. For her fascination for dark mysterious men. Men that would often leave her more times than she cared to admit to leaving her only to wanting more. Desiring More, more than they could offer her, leaving her with a burning desire to find more than they could give her. 

As Christina’ stood there her long dark hair covering over her eyes as the wind blew around her. Bringing with it the sounds of night, the sounds of the Raven’ as it beckoned for Christina’ on that foggy dark night. But as we get to know more of Christina’ never a girl to dress to impress, more than less finding herself in a pair of stone washed cut at the knee jeans and black tee. To match her personality, a girl who felt like she didn’t have to impress anyone. 

Just that if someone wanted her, then it was up to them to impress her, which would often leave her desiring more than they gave her. But as the sounds of the night grew quiet, another sound would then echo through the air. As a Raven then flew by her, crowing to her

“NeverMore”

Looking out into the night looking deep into a fog covered area revealing only shadows. But as Christina’ continued to look into the fog a man from deep within it would emerge, lurking from within its grasps, As he just stood there all dressed up in a long dark tailcoat gothic style cost. With his dark curly hair and goatee. Just standing there looking over to her. Just as the Raven then flew by Christina’ once again saying 

“NeverMore”

Just as the mysterious man then said to Christina’ 

“Why go ahead my dear, and you just say the words. And we shall go from there. Knowing how insane one could be knowing him”

For some words where never meant to be spoken but as we shall later see that some unsuspecting people would say the words 

“ Who killed Edgar Allan Poe”

Just as he then vanished back into the foggy night, leaving Christina’ even more curious more than ever now. A curiosity that would leave her knowing more than she ever desired, Standing there running her fingers through her dark hair, Knowing that she had always been surrounded by Dark mysterious men for their presence alone always brought Christina’ wanting to know more. More than they could ever give her. Always finding herself being drawn closer to them by wanting to be with them.

Always wanting to find the darker side of a person, while at the same time not always understanding them. But always finding herself amongst them loving them even if it left her in the dark. If it was for a night of hard sex, Or just finding herself hanging out with them. Looking for the darker side of them. 

But for her, that fascination would leave her in feeling more than words one can say. Or at least one can try to say, But as the night grew longer, as the fog became more deeper in closing her around in it. Our story begins here, for Legend has it that on that day in 1849’ when after five days that when they first found him. Being the one and only 

Edgar Allan Poe’

It is said that the cause of his death remains unknown, But it is said that on the night of when they first found him. That if one, Or others were to stand at his grave and chant the words 

“Who Killed Edgar Allan Poe’”

That they just might find out! But as Christina’ stood there hearing the sounds of darkness echo all around her, along with the sounds of the Raven’ off in the distance hearing it beckon for her

Seeing as the fog would begin to in close on her, With her now seeing nothing but the dimming of a street light off in the distance. But as she looked closer, The same figure was now standing there up underneath the street light. Standing there with a mysterious draw to him, with Christina’ now finding herself being drawn in by him. 

Standing there as the sounds of a Raven’ Could be heard as it flew by her once again as if it was beckoning for her to come. To be and be with him, as Christina’ just stood there looking at a dark figure wearing a long dark gothic style tailcoat. With other clothing to match, with Christina’ Feeling him beckoning for her to come to him. 

As he just stood there directly in front of her, hearing the sounds of the Raven’ calling out her name. As the darkness grew even more around her, But as quickly as he had come, He was now once more hidden back into the fog from which he had come. As Christina’ now stood there looking at a gravestone. Not just any gravestone, But being that of a one Edgar Allen Poe’

As Christina’ could hear the Raven’ crowing into the nights air. With her just standing there looking out into the forever of the darkness of the night. Up underneath a starless nights sky. But if one was to wish upon a star, it would be for one more night for her. One more night to feel him once more. To feel his hands once again up against her, Showing her the feeling that she had yarned for. As her heart was now pounding for more, knowing that once with him Just wasn’t enough for her.

Standing there trying her best to think back on what happened the last five days. Even contemplating to herself, If she really even cared. For they had made their own choice in doing this. But regardless it was Five days, that she will never forget, 

For they will be NeverMore in this world, for the Raven had came for them he had came for them. Never more to know him, to know of his name. For insane to world he had become to a world in which wanted to know 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe, 

And that just wasn’t good enough for Christina’ as she stood there thinking to herself, Should she say it. Should she say the words, For her fascination with dark mysterious men would definitely end with him. But dam! If He could make her feel that way one more time, Then death! Just Bring your ass on! For Christina’ was ready, ready for whatever happens even if it was for her to be

NeverMore

But a girl could always dream, but not this girl! Hell no! For she wanted more than just dreams of him. She wanted to feel him again even if it was to be

NeverMore

But as she stood there thinking to herself! Should she say?

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe?”

But Christina’ being a dark haired girl, Having that gothic charm about her leaving others wanting to know more about her. But never to please her the way that she wanted them to. But Christina’ Knew that she was going to get what she wanted. With her even knowing what happened five nights ago, though she could have never dreamed of anything of this ever happening to anyone. But hey! They asked for it! And she was a girl with needs! Needs that needed to be filled. By the one who could have her being NeverMore! As the Raven flew by saying 

NeverMore

But for now shall we go back to five nights prior, Five nights ago when it all started. But the story will not be starting at night, but that morning, after waking up from a good night of sex. Sex that Christina’ was looking forward to, But still leaving her not feeling completely satisfied.

As she lay there thinking to herself, Was it good Enough? But as usual! Finding herself waking up to an half empty bed beside her. For her so called lover! If one could even can call him that! But to her, After a good night of fucking for him Just wasn’t enough for her. Guessing that’s why her so called lover! Would always show his ass the door before she could. Always finding them gone by morning gone before waking up, as she lay there looking up to the ceiling saying 

“I swear! Guys these days! Just want to get there dicks wet then split!”

Always just to leave her just to finish the rest of the job herself! it’s like goodbye! Thanks for the fuck! More like a smack on my ass! And a kiss on my cheek! Was there way of Telling me! Hey your ass and the ride was great! But dam! This girl needs more than just a dick and a smack on her ass. 

But hey! If you can find a guy who can say more than a words! And do more than just fuck! It’s like hey! my ass is all they want to talk to! Well next time! My ass is going to be doing a hell of lot more talking! If the sounds of my farts is all that they want hear as they fuck me! Then so be it! 

For if they leave me wanting more! Then I’m just going to blow some wind in there face! And tell them to not let the dam door hit them on their ass on the way out. They can just leave! If they leave me unfinished and not filled! But hey sometimes a touch can go much further them one knows. 

I mean hell! If I could get just one guy wanting to touch more than my ass! As he fucks me! Then leaves knowing that his little cock got all up in me! Dam! What is a girl to do just get a touch nowadays, 

For God knows a girl wants more than just a smack on the ass! But it wouldn’t be God that answered her, But someone much darker. To match her gothic style, Leaving her feeling like a girl that has been fulfilled. And occasional holding would be nice, But I guess that would be asking too much, For in a way Christina’ would always leave herself wishing for more.

But when darkness is all she knows then there just isn’t much room left for love! Only sex! But God knows when she will get fully filled again maybe another week or two. Whenever the need for someone to fuck her again kicks in.

Now finding herself getting out of bed seeing the light of day peering into her room like a perv! It wanted to see more of her standing there with her nude ass and all to see! But with a quick pull of the shade and out you go. 

Walking into the bathroom as Christina’ stood there looking into the mirror, looking at herself, Slowly sliding her hand through her dark hair. Knowing dam well that she could do much better than the guys around her. 

Standing there looking at 45 year old girl, Wondering to herself 45 and only a fuck buddy! Well the fuck buddy needs to fuck a hell of lot better! Because if I’m going to give someone my inside! Then they dam well better feel me up all through the night! But being on her own isn’t so bad. It gives her the freedom to be free, To be her

Deciding to finally to get dressed for the day, a little dark eye liner here and there! slapping on a pair of stone washed cut at the knees jeans. Along with a black shirt to go with it. This gothic girl was ready for whatever the day would bring to her! And bring it would in a way that would leave her Not forgetting anytime soon. Not forgetting about the shoes, A pair a converses, And with that, To venture into whatever finds her. And find her something would, Something that she could have never imagined that would be. But imagined is beyond belief, This was beyond death itself. 

Making her way out the door of her apartment here the usual get the hell out! From her neighbor, I guess she didn’t get her feel either, Not even making it off of her floor. When she then came upon a scene that would forever leave her asking? Is death even dead?

Coming to the end of the hallway seeing a couple of cops standing there, standing there with their dicks in their hands as usual around here. Standing there just outside of jimmy’s apartment. Jimmy’ was someone that she would talk to every now and then, not as friends. But more like a neighbor. 

For Jimmy’ was into some serious, dark shit, Some Very dark shit. That often had Christina’ questioning at times. As she then stopped to ask one of the officers, just long enough for him to quit holding his dick in his hands. If anything had happened but as usual the dicks just didn’t know what ass to look or go up. 

Only knowing the hookers ass around the corner, And not really to her surprise the officer didn’t know dick. As he just told me that the landlord had found jimmy dead. As Christina’ then thought to herself 

“Well no shit! How about you get your dick out of your hands and actually do some detective shit!”

But that was just too much to ask, but apparently someone had Murdered! Jimmy’ sometime in the night, but who? Officer dick sure wasn’t going to find out. Who murdered Jimmy. The only the thing they were finding was their lunch. But as Christina’ then walked by the opened door she could see Jimmy’s body lying there all covered on the floor. With blood all on the floor. But Not being unnerved enough by that, bit what was just above him, written on the wall in blood was the words written 

NeverMore

Just then as a Raven’ flew into an open window landing on it’s bottom frame as it the crowed 

“NeverMore”

Like she said, Jimmy’ was into some serious, dark shit. Walking on past making her way outside, where she would then run into another guy. Someone that Christina’ didn’t mind talking to every now and then, that also lived here.

His name was Johnny’ a dark skinned guy, always in his leather black jacket. Sunny outside or not, he was wearing that jacket. With his eyes and hair to match he was someone that Christina’ would often find herself talking to, in a way often finding herself wanting to get close at times. 

But he already had someone, as Christina’ then thought to her herself, at least Johnny’ knew how to please someone. But as Christina’ then walked up to him asking if he had heard anything of what happened to Jimmy’ With Johnny only giving a snark remark! Saying to her! 

“Look! I don’t know! Johnny was into some shady shit and stuff! More than likely a drug debt!” 

With Christina’ then looking to him saying to him in also in a snarky remark 

“Look. I know! Well sorta knew Jimmy’ much more she should have known about him. And that he wasn’t into drugs Johnny’ he was into some serious dark shit! But not drugs, but you don’t have to be so snarky you know”

With Johnny just looking at her, as he then threw his cigarette onto the ground as he said then said to her

“Look! The other night me and Jimmy and four other people, who I didn’t know who they were, well we went down to the Graveyard the other night. And when you said that Jimmy was into some dark shit you wasn’t kidding. I only went along for the ride! But him and the other ones was there for something else!”

With Christina’ then replying 

“Something else! What do you mean something else!”

As Johnny just stared at her giving her a look of disbelief! Before saying 

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

As Christina’ then looked back at him curious like then saying 

“What! What do you mean? Who killed Edgar Allan Poe”

As Johnny always acting the cool guy just looked to Christina’ saying to her 

“Yeah that! We was at his grave sight with some candles and shit! When they started to try to summon something by chanting!”

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

“I mean, I was only along for the ride you know but who knows!”

But as Christina’ then left Johnny to be! She then just made her way about the day, just wondering to what he had said. But Later that night as the darkness of the night was just beginning to set in. A moonless night at that, But as the darkness would come, so would the sounds of other things that night would follow with it. Followed by the sounds of the Raven’ saying to her

NeverMore 

As Christina’ stood there on the roof looking out into the city landscape, still thinking of what Johnny had said to her. Just as a guy off in the distance was just a shredding away on his guitar. Knowing that darkness was coming for someone that night leaving them to be

NeverMore 

As the Raven flew through the night, But deep down within the city we find a young dark haired guy, named Chang’ wearing jeans and a jacket, just making his way out from a corner coffee shop. Carrying a laptop from which he had been working on his novel, but unfortunately for him, a little chanting her had done just a couple of nights ago. Asking 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe

But as just as Chang’ then turned a corner hearing a voice say to him

“For insane I have became, Insane to a world in which wants to know who killed Edgar Allan Poe”

With Chang’ now turning only to see a dark haired man with a goatee, wearing a gothic style black turn tail coat. Watching him as he then made his way from out of the darkened alley way. Asking Chang’

“So a writer I see you want to be, but how insane can you be! Or how insane do you wish to be”

As Chang’ then said back to him

“Who are you? And why do want to know about me wanting to be a writer?”

As the figure then said to Chang’ 

“Is it not I that you seek? To see how insane I have become to a world that wishes to know”

As Chang’ then replied back saying to him

“What do you mean, is not I that I seek? I seek no one! Now leave me be!”

But as the figure then walked closer to Chang’ saying to him

“Oh but you do, you seek to know how insane I have become! So now I will tell you!”

As Chang’ then said back to him

“Tell me what!”

As the figure then replied back to Chang’ saying 

Who killed Edgar Alan Poe

For dead he did indeed leave Chang’ letting him know on how insane he had become to the world. For Chang’ was now

NeverMore

But as her thoughts would go, so would the night. Leaving someone to be NeverMore! As the morning would come, with Christina’ not really wanting to get up,deciding to lay there in her bed listening whatever was on the television. As her fingers just filled in the rest! 

But as she watched the morning news a segment would then catch her attention, and her attention it did. For they the news crew was at a scene of a murder that had happened last night. But as they were talking to the detective, some words would then suddenly come into view, as the camera would then show the words. For written on the wall in blood behind them were the words 

NeverMore

Quickly getting out of bed and getting herself dressed. Making her way down town, at least trying to make her way downtown without being harassed by a couple of guys wanting to know her ass. But as Christina’ being the girl she was just turned around giving them the bird.

Just as a Raven’ then flew by them crowing to them

NeverMore

But as Christina’ soon found herself on the way scene as Christina’ continued to make her way, to scene of the murder, of person with no head. For it would never be found as they were NeverMore to world around them. As he would find out how insane the one that he summoned had became. As the world would continue to want to know 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe,

As Christina’ stood there looking at the words, just as a Raven’ Then Flew by her landing on a railing, crowing 

“NeverMore”

Standing there now looking at the Raven’ just as it then flew off into the day. Leaving the dead person to be, leaving him to a world that wished to know. But only leaving them to knowing 

NeverMore 

And Leaving Christina’ now with more questions than answers, As Christina’ then made her way back across town looking for Johnny with no luck. 

But as day turned into night! Finding herself standing on top of the roof of her building looking out into the city’s landscape. As the same guy was just a shredding away on his guitar. Thinking to herself there had to be a connection with the murders, But what! Or who? For as the next two nights would come. So would two more murders, Leaving them to be

NeverMore

With the same words written 

“NeverMore!”

But as the dead of night would once again leave, 
Bringing with it a new day! Just not for some! Making her way out of her apartment and into the street. Where she would finally run into Johnny’! Making her way over to him kinda yelling at him asking him.  

“The four other people that was with you and Jimmy’ were they the ones murdered the last four nights”

With Johnny just looking at her giving her his same snarky remark saying to her

“Look! I was only along the ride! Those other five were there for some serious dark shit! But if you are so worried about me turning up murdered! Then you need not worry yourself toots”! 

With Christina’ just standing there shaking her head at Johnny as I said to him

“ Yeah well good luck with that shit Johnny!”

Leaving him to be, now going about her day waiting for the night to come, but darkness was never far away. as Christina’ would wait to see if Johnny was right about that or not. But she just guessed  we shall find out soon enough. And soon enough she would leaving her feeling like no one has ever before.

Now Finding herself once again standing there on the roof thinking to herself! the bride once again to be! Looking out into the endless night. Thinking That there was going to be no honeymoon for her anytime soon! 

Standing there looking out into a city landscape of street lights glaring into the city’s night, Just as she then suddenly heard a sound behind her. Turning to only see an individual wearing a solid black gothic style tailcoat old school style, More like the turn of the century style 

With his face being hidden by the shadows of the night just as a Raven’ then flew by her landing on the ledge beside her crowing

“NeverMore!”

Just as the individual standing there looking at her then said to her

“I have became insane! to a world that wants to know!” More than they should know!”

“But For those who chose not to know, never to suffer would they! But instead! Never to been blessed by knowing me”

“Do you want to know? My love!

As Christina’ then said back to him

“Do I want to know what”?

Laughing as he then walked closer to her revealing more of what she wanted to see! As the shadow of the night slowly left from his face. Revealing everything that she wanted to see! Leaving her wanted to know more! For standing there in front of her was a dark haired man around 40’ with a goatee, wearing a solid long black tail coat. Wearing clothes not of this century 

Leaving Christina’ more enticed than ever, Her eyes and heart were now set into place, with her now wanting more. More than she even dared herself to ask, But resist she could not! For there was just something mesmerizing about him that she wanted more off. A feeling of she needed him, a desire that she just could not hide anymore. Finding herself now wanting to know more of him that night. 

As he then smiled at her saying to her

Are you sure that you don’t want to know?

With her again asking him

“know what?”

Knowing that she very much wanted to know more! To know everything about him! 

As he then laughed at me saying to me 

“To know me! Is to know Death! For I have become insane! But to those wishing to know more! I share not what one seeks! But choose instead to only show what one may desire to know”

And desired to know more Christina’ did! Finding herself now coming closer to him, knowing that something about him was more than she wanted to know. But resist she could not! For his presence alone left her feeling it all up inside of her. 

As he then approached her slowly placing his hand on the side of her head, massaging his fingers slowly through her hair. Christina’ was now fully engaged to wanting to know more! More of his touch! Her need to be filled was here and in a big way! And feel it! She very much was! Feeling his hand upon her, every desire of wanting to know more! Was now wanting more! 

As he then placed both of his hands on her head sliding them slowly through her hair, as Christina’s body was now ready for his touch. A touch that she had been yearning for. To show her what she had been looking for, With him now looking at her as he then said 

“To know more, is to desire what one wants to feel! And if you need is to feel? Then my desire is to know you.”

The desire was here, Christina’ thoughts were here, my body was all his! And all he needed to do was feed my desire. The desire to feel every part of him!

Taking off his coat as he placed it on the ground, as he then looked to her placing his finger up to her lips. before saying to her 

“ I know your desire! Now let me know you! 

Christina’ was there! Her desire was now his to do with as he pleased! As he slowly slid his hand down the side of her face, sliding his fingers over  and under her shirt and across her chest! Christina’ heart was pounding! Her body was there in complete control of his hands. Christina’ could feel the sweat on her, ready for his body to be on her. 

For this girl might not be a bride to be, But for one night, She just may need a priest to exercise what ever he puts into her. For she was going to be screaming to the heavens above that hells fire was now burning inside of her, Feeling the heat from his touch, 

Feeling his lips slowly touching her, Pulling her closer feeling his chest up next to hers, With his hands slowly gliding across her back! She wanted this to last all night. To feel hells fire burn within her! As Her body was pulsating, To his very touch. A touch like no other to her. As he then slowly took off her shirt feeling his fingers slowly sliding across her breast! Feeling his breath as her body! now fully up against her as he then whispering to her ear. 

“Tonight my love I will know you as you desire!”

As the flames would ride higher! So would he! As he then slowly lay me down upon coat, sliding his hands through her hair. As Christina’ body was now on fire from the inside! Feeling the burn of his touch inside of her, slowly sliding his hands across her chest. Feeling and teasing her nipples, the sweat pouring from her. 

As he then Massaged her breasts with his hands, with his tongue dancing and slowly gliding around all around her neck. Up to her Christina’s cheek, As Christina’ lay there with her hands now firmly on him, pulling him tighter up against her. Feeling him rub all up against her, With her hands now slowly sliding down his back onto his ass feeling him. Rub himself all up and down her! Before slowly sliding his hands back across her stomach down to her pants. 

Looking at her as he then unzipped her pants sliding them off of her! As his fingers danced around in her! feeling his hands coming back up through her legs. Teasing her inside, as Christina held on! Feeling his breath on her neck as his fingers danced around in her. 

Before slowly Sliding his hands back  up her legs, slinging up to firmly grabbing a hold of her ass. As his tongue found its way all around her neck. Up and into her mouth, as his fingers danced away inside of her. 

Hell was definitely on fire that night! With his hand now firmly holding me against her, going in and out her. Feeling every finger as his hand danced around inside of her.

As he then raised back up taking off his shirt and pants! Just Before placing his body once again upon her. 

feeling his sweat as he then placed her hands around his back moving them up behind his head. 

Christina’ could now feel every bit of him going deep inside of her! Her hands now firmly grabbing a hold of his back 

As the Devil was now looking up to Christina Ricci’ saying

“Dam! I would give up hell just to be in her!” 

As there bodies were now becoming one, to the night!  as they then slowly made love on the roof not really caring if anyone was watching. For as the night went on so did he! For Christina’ had never made love to anyone like she did to him that night. 

But as good things come, they also have to go! 

But just before he would disappear forever into back into the night, he then turned to Christina’ asking her

“Do you want to know?”

With Christina’ now looking at him saying 

“Know what?

With him just looking at her before saying 

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

With Christina’ then asking 

“Who!”

As he then just laughed as he said

“I did!

“I killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

As he then just looked at her laughing as he then just vanished into the night never to seen again.

As the Raven behind her once again crowed

“NeverMore!” 

Just before it flew off into the night!

While him leaving her knowing that her every desire he did feel that night, leaving Christina’ even more fascinated to find out more about him. Drawing her closer to him. For to know his love, his insanity, to feel him once more! is to know the darkness that he has become!

Leaving her now standing there on the roof thinking to herself what about Johnny? Did he kill Johnny?

But she guessed that she will just have to wait until the morning, But if so, then Johnny would be

NeverMore

Leaving Christina Ricci’ then asking herself? Dose she now want to be 

NeverMore herself

For as long as Christina Ricci’ a forty five year old brown eyed, dark haired girl, Having the attitude to match. Her gothic charm, that was all about her, a charm that set her apart from other girls. But for as long as she could always remember, remember having a fascination for dark mysterious men. Men that would often leave her in the dark a place that was often familiar with her. As the wind blew through her dark hair blowing it in and around her face. While hearing the sounds of the Raven off in the distance beckoning to her saying to her for

NeverMore 

On this night never shall you find yourself desiring another for NeverMore no other shall know you. With Christina’ Often finding herself just wanting to be alone, finding herself often alone in the dark. Looking for more, more than she would often find in her life. For her fascination for dark mysterious men. Men that would often leave her more times than she cared to admit to leaving her only to wanting more. Desiring More, more than they could offer her, leaving her with a burning desire to find more than they could give her. 

As Christina’ stood there her long dark hair covering over her eyes as the wind blew around her. Bringing with it the sounds of night, the sounds of the Raven’ as it beckoned for Christina’ on that foggy dark night. But as we get to know more of Christina’ never a girl to dress to impress, more than less finding herself in a pair of stone washed cut at the knee jeans and black tee. To match her personality, a girl who felt like she didn’t have to impress anyone. 

Just that if someone wanted her, then it was up to them to impress her, which would often leave her desiring more than they gave her. But as the sounds of the night grew quiet, another sound would then echo through the air. As a Raven then flew by her, crowing to her

“NeverMore”

Looking out into the night looking deep into a fog covered area revealing only shadows. But as Christina’ continued to look into the fog a man from deep within it would emerge, lurking from within its grasps, As he just stood there all dressed up in a long dark tailcoat gothic style cost. With his dark curly hair and goatee. Just standing there looking over to her. Just as the Raven then flew by Christina’ once again saying 

“NeverMore”

Just as the mysterious man then said to Christina’ 

“Why go ahead my dear, and you just say the words. And we shall go from there. Knowing how insane one could be knowing him”

For some words where never meant to be spoken but as we shall later see that some unsuspecting people would say the words 

“ Who killed Edgar Allan Poe”

Just as he then vanished back into the foggy night, leaving Christina’ even more curious more than ever now. A curiosity that would leave her knowing more than she ever desired, Standing there running her fingers through her dark hair, Knowing that she had always been surrounded by Dark mysterious men for their presence alone always brought Christina’ wanting to know more. More than they could ever give her. Always finding herself being drawn closer to them by wanting to be with them.

Always wanting to find the darker side of a person, while at the same time not always understanding them. But always finding herself amongst them loving them even if it left her in the dark. If it was for a night of hard sex, Or just finding herself hanging out with them. Looking for the darker side of them. 

But for her, that fascination would leave her in feeling more than words one can say. Or at least one can try to say, But as the night grew longer, as the fog became more deeper in closing her around in it. Our story begins here, for Legend has it that on that day in 1849’ when after five days that when they first found him. Being the one and only 

Edgar Allan Poe’

It is said that the cause of his death remains unknown, But it is said that on the night of when they first found him. That if one, Or others were to stand at his grave and chant the words 

“Who Killed Edgar Allan Poe’”

That they just might find out! But as Christina’ stood there hearing the sounds of darkness echo all around her, along with the sounds of the Raven’ off in the distance hearing it beckon for her

Seeing as the fog would begin to in close on her, With her now seeing nothing but the dimming of a street light off in the distance. But as she looked closer, The same figure was now standing there up underneath the street light. Standing there with a mysterious draw to him, with Christina’ now finding herself being drawn in by him. 

Standing there as the sounds of a Raven’ Could be heard as it flew by her once again as if it was beckoning for her to come. To be and be with him, as Christina’ just stood there looking at a dark figure wearing a long dark gothic style tailcoat. With other clothing to match, with Christina’ Feeling him beckoning for her to come to him. 

As he just stood there directly in front of her, hearing the sounds of the Raven’ calling out her name. As the darkness grew even more around her, But as quickly as he had come, He was now once more hidden back into the fog from which he had come. As Christina’ now stood there looking at a gravestone. Not just any gravestone, But being that of a one Edgar Allen Poe’

As Christina’ could hear the Raven’ crowing into the nights air. With her just standing there looking out into the forever of the darkness of the night. Up underneath a starless nights sky. But if one was to wish upon a star, it would be for one more night for her. One more night to feel him once more. To feel his hands once again up against her, Showing her the feeling that she had yarned for. As her heart was now pounding for more, knowing that once with him Just wasn’t enough for her.

Standing there trying her best to think back on what happened the last five days. Even contemplating to herself, If she really even cared. For they had made their own choice in doing this. But regardless it was Five days, that she will never forget, 

For they will be NeverMore in this world, for the Raven had came for them he had came for them. Never more to know him, to know of his name. For insane to world he had become to a world in which wanted to know 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe, 

And that just wasn’t good enough for Christina’ as she stood there thinking to herself, Should she say it. Should she say the words, For her fascination with dark mysterious men would definitely end with him. But dam! If He could make her feel that way one more time, Then death! Just Bring your ass on! For Christina’ was ready, ready for whatever happens even if it was for her to be

NeverMore

But a girl could always dream, but not this girl! Hell no! For she wanted more than just dreams of him. She wanted to feel him again even if it was to be

NeverMore

But as she stood there thinking to herself! Should she say?

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe?”

But Christina’ being a dark haired girl, Having that gothic charm about her leaving others wanting to know more about her. But never to please her the way that she wanted them to. But Christina’ Knew that she was going to get what she wanted. With her even knowing what happened five nights ago, though she could have never dreamed of anything of this ever happening to anyone. But hey! They asked for it! And she was a girl with needs! Needs that needed to be filled. By the one who could have her being NeverMore! As the Raven flew by saying 

NeverMore

But for now shall we go back to five nights prior, Five nights ago when it all started. But the story will not be starting at night, but that morning, after waking up from a good night of sex. Sex that Christina’ was looking forward to, But still leaving her not feeling completely satisfied.

As she lay there thinking to herself, Was it good Enough? But as usual! Finding herself waking up to an half empty bed beside her. For her so called lover! If one could even can call him that! But to her, After a good night of fucking for him Just wasn’t enough for her. Guessing that’s why her so called lover! Would always show his ass the door before she could. Always finding them gone by morning gone before waking up, as she lay there looking up to the ceiling saying 

“I swear! Guys these days! Just want to get there dicks wet then split!”

Always just to leave her just to finish the rest of the job herself! it’s like goodbye! Thanks for the fuck! More like a smack on my ass! And a kiss on my cheek! Was there way of Telling me! Hey your ass and the ride was great! But dam! This girl needs more than just a dick and a smack on her ass. 

But hey! If you can find a guy who can say more than a words! And do more than just fuck! It’s like hey! my ass is all they want to talk to! Well next time! My ass is going to be doing a hell of lot more talking! If the sounds of my farts is all that they want hear as they fuck me! Then so be it! 

For if they leave me wanting more! Then I’m just going to blow some wind in there face! And tell them to not let the dam door hit them on their ass on the way out. They can just leave! If they leave me unfinished and not filled! But hey sometimes a touch can go much further them one knows. 

I mean hell! If I could get just one guy wanting to touch more than my ass! As he fucks me! Then leaves knowing that his little cock got all up in me! Dam! What is a girl to do just get a touch nowadays, 

For God knows a girl wants more than just a smack on the ass! But it wouldn’t be God that answered her, But someone much darker. To match her gothic style, Leaving her feeling like a girl that has been fulfilled. And occasional holding would be nice, But I guess that would be asking too much, For in a way Christina’ would always leave herself wishing for more.

But when darkness is all she knows then there just isn’t much room left for love! Only sex! But God knows when she will get fully filled again maybe another week or two. Whenever the need for someone to fuck her again kicks in.

Now finding herself getting out of bed seeing the light of day peering into her room like a perv! It wanted to see more of her standing there with her nude ass and all to see! But with a quick pull of the shade and out you go. 

Walking into the bathroom as Christina’ stood there looking into the mirror, looking at herself, Slowly sliding her hand through her dark hair. Knowing dam well that she could do much better than the guys around her. 

Standing there looking at 45 year old girl, Wondering to herself 45 and only a fuck buddy! Well the fuck buddy needs to fuck a hell of lot better! Because if I’m going to give someone my inside! Then they dam well better feel me up all through the night! But being on her own isn’t so bad. It gives her the freedom to be free, To be her

Deciding to finally to get dressed for the day, a little dark eye liner here and there! slapping on a pair of stone washed cut at the knees jeans. Along with a black shirt to go with it. This gothic girl was ready for whatever the day would bring to her! And bring it would in a way that would leave her Not forgetting anytime soon. Not forgetting about the shoes, A pair a converses, And with that, To venture into whatever finds her. And find her something would, Something that she could have never imagined that would be. But imagined is beyond belief, This was beyond death itself. 

Making her way out the door of her apartment here the usual get the hell out! From her neighbor, I guess she didn’t get her feel either, Not even making it off of her floor. When she then came upon a scene that would forever leave her asking? Is death even dead?

Coming to the end of the hallway seeing a couple of cops standing there, standing there with their dicks in their hands as usual around here. Standing there just outside of jimmy’s apartment. Jimmy’ was someone that she would talk to every now and then, not as friends. But more like a neighbor. 

For Jimmy’ was into some serious, dark shit, Some Very dark shit. That often had Christina’ questioning at times. As she then stopped to ask one of the officers, just long enough for him to quit holding his dick in his hands. If anything had happened but as usual the dicks just didn’t know what ass to look or go up. 

Only knowing the hookers ass around the corner, And not really to her surprise the officer didn’t know dick. As he just told me that the landlord had found jimmy dead. As Christina’ then thought to herself 

“Well no shit! How about you get your dick out of your hands and actually do some detective shit!”

But that was just too much to ask, but apparently someone had Murdered! Jimmy’ sometime in the night, but who? Officer dick sure wasn’t going to find out. Who murdered Jimmy. The only the thing they were finding was their lunch. But as Christina’ then walked by the opened door she could see Jimmy’s body lying there all covered on the floor. With blood all on the floor. But Not being unnerved enough by that, bit what was just above him, written on the wall in blood was the words written 

NeverMore

Just then as a Raven’ flew into an open window landing on it’s bottom frame as it the crowed 

“NeverMore”

Like she said, Jimmy’ was into some serious, dark shit. Walking on past making her way outside, where she would then run into another guy. Someone that Christina’ didn’t mind talking to every now and then, that also lived here.

His name was Johnny’ a dark skinned guy, always in his leather black jacket. Sunny outside or not, he was wearing that jacket. With his eyes and hair to match he was someone that Christina’ would often find herself talking to, in a way often finding herself wanting to get close at times. 

But he already had someone, as Christina’ then thought to her herself, at least Johnny’ knew how to please someone. But as Christina’ then walked up to him asking if he had heard anything of what happened to Jimmy’ With Johnny only giving a snark remark! Saying to her! 

“Look! I don’t know! Johnny was into some shady shit and stuff! More than likely a drug debt!” 

With Christina’ then looking to him saying to him in also in a snarky remark 

“Look. I know! Well sorta knew Jimmy’ much more she should have known about him. And that he wasn’t into drugs Johnny’ he was into some serious dark shit! But not drugs, but you don’t have to be so snarky you know”

With Johnny just looking at her, as he then threw his cigarette onto the ground as he said then said to her

“Look! The other night me and Jimmy and four other people, who I didn’t know who they were, well we went down to the Graveyard the other night. And when you said that Jimmy was into some dark shit you wasn’t kidding. I only went along for the ride! But him and the other ones was there for something else!”

With Christina’ then replying 

“Something else! What do you mean something else!”

As Johnny just stared at her giving her a look of disbelief! Before saying 

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

As Christina’ then looked back at him curious like then saying 

“What! What do you mean? Who killed Edgar Allan Poe”

As Johnny always acting the cool guy just looked to Christina’ saying to her 

“Yeah that! We was at his grave sight with some candles and shit! When they started to try to summon something by chanting!”

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

“I mean, I was only along for the ride you know but who knows!”

But as Christina’ then left Johnny to be! She then just made her way about the day, just wondering to what he had said. But Later that night as the darkness of the night was just beginning to set in. A moonless night at that, But as the darkness would come, so would the sounds of other things that night would follow with it. Followed by the sounds of the Raven’ saying to her

NeverMore 

As Christina’ stood there on the roof looking out into the city landscape, still thinking of what Johnny had said to her. Just as a guy off in the distance was just a shredding away on his guitar. Knowing that darkness was coming for someone that night leaving them to be

NeverMore 

As the Raven flew through the night, But deep down within the city we find a young dark haired guy, named Chang’ wearing jeans and a jacket, just making his way out from a corner coffee shop. Carrying a laptop from which he had been working on his novel, but unfortunately for him, a little chanting her had done just a couple of nights ago. Asking 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe

But as just as Chang’ then turned a corner hearing a voice say to him

“For insane I have became, Insane to a world in which wants to know who killed Edgar Allan Poe”

With Chang’ now turning only to see a dark haired man with a goatee, wearing a gothic style black turn tail coat. Watching him as he then made his way from out of the darkened alley way. Asking Chang’

“So a writer I see you want to be, but how insane can you be! Or how insane do you wish to be”

As Chang’ then said back to him

“Who are you? And why do want to know about me wanting to be a writer?”

As the figure then said to Chang’ 

“Is it not I that you seek? To see how insane I have become to a world that wishes to know”

As Chang’ then replied back saying to him

“What do you mean, is not I that I seek? I seek no one! Now leave me be!”

But as the figure then walked closer to Chang’ saying to him

“Oh but you do, you seek to know how insane I have become! So now I will tell you!”

As Chang’ then said back to him

“Tell me what!”

As the figure then replied back to Chang’ saying 

Who killed Edgar Alan Poe

For dead he did indeed leave Chang’ letting him know on how insane he had become to the world. For Chang’ was now

NeverMore

But as her thoughts would go, so would the night. Leaving someone to be NeverMore! As the morning would come, with Christina’ not really wanting to get up,deciding to lay there in her bed listening whatever was on the television. As her fingers just filled in the rest! 

But as she watched the morning news a segment would then catch her attention, and her attention it did. For they the news crew was at a scene of a murder that had happened last night. But as they were talking to the detective, some words would then suddenly come into view, as the camera would then show the words. For written on the wall in blood behind them were the words 

NeverMore

Quickly getting out of bed and getting herself dressed. Making her way down town, at least trying to make her way downtown without being harassed by a couple of guys wanting to know her ass. But as Christina’ being the girl she was just turned around giving them the bird.

Just as a Raven’ then flew by them crowing to them

NeverMore

But as Christina’ soon found herself on the way scene as Christina’ continued to make her way, to scene of the murder, of person with no head. For it would never be found as they were NeverMore to world around them. As he would find out how insane the one that he summoned had became. As the world would continue to want to know 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe,

As Christina’ stood there looking at the words, just as a Raven’ Then Flew by her landing on a railing, crowing 

“NeverMore”

Standing there now looking at the Raven’ just as it then flew off into the day. Leaving the dead person to be, leaving him to a world that wished to know. But only leaving them to knowing 

NeverMore 

And Leaving Christina’ now with more questions than answers, As Christina’ then made her way back across town looking for Johnny with no luck. 

But as day turned into night! Finding herself standing on top of the roof of her building looking out into the city’s landscape. As the same guy was just a shredding away on his guitar. Thinking to herself there had to be a connection with the murders, But what! Or who? For as the next two nights would come. So would two more murders, Leaving them to be

NeverMore

With the same words written 

“NeverMore!”

But as the dead of night would once again leave, 
Bringing with it a new day! Just not for some! Making her way out of her apartment and into the street. Where she would finally run into Johnny’! Making her way over to him kinda yelling at him asking him.  

“The four other people that was with you and Jimmy’ were they the ones murdered the last four nights”

With Johnny just looking at her giving her his same snarky remark saying to her

“Look! I was only along the ride! Those other five were there for some serious dark shit! But if you are so worried about me turning up murdered! Then you need not worry yourself toots”! 

With Christina’ just standing there shaking her head at Johnny as I said to him

“ Yeah well good luck with that shit Johnny!”

Leaving him to be, now going about her day waiting for the night to come, but darkness was never far away. as Christina’ would wait to see if Johnny was right about that or not. But she just guessed  we shall find out soon enough. And soon enough she would leaving her feeling like no one has ever before.

Now Finding herself once again standing there on the roof thinking to herself! the bride once again to be! Looking out into the endless night. Thinking That there was going to be no honeymoon for her anytime soon! 

Standing there looking out into a city landscape of street lights glaring into the city’s night, Just as she then suddenly heard a sound behind her. Turning to only see an individual wearing a solid black gothic style tailcoat old school style, More like the turn of the century style 

With his face being hidden by the shadows of the night just as a Raven’ then flew by her landing on the ledge beside her crowing

“NeverMore!”

Just as the individual standing there looking at her then said to her

“I have became insane! to a world that wants to know!” More than they should know!”

“But For those who chose not to know, never to suffer would they! But instead! Never to been blessed by knowing me”

“Do you want to know? My love!

As Christina’ then said back to him

“Do I want to know what”?

Laughing as he then walked closer to her revealing more of what she wanted to see! As the shadow of the night slowly left from his face. Revealing everything that she wanted to see! Leaving her wanted to know more! For standing there in front of her was a dark haired man around 40’ with a goatee, wearing a solid long black tail coat. Wearing clothes not of this century 

Leaving Christina’ more enticed than ever, Her eyes and heart were now set into place, with her now wanting more. More than she even dared herself to ask, But resist she could not! For there was just something mesmerizing about him that she wanted more off. A feeling of she needed him, a desire that she just could not hide anymore. Finding herself now wanting to know more of him that night. 

As he then smiled at her saying to her

Are you sure that you don’t want to know?

With her again asking him

“know what?”

Knowing that she very much wanted to know more! To know everything about him! 

As he then laughed at me saying to me 

“To know me! Is to know Death! For I have become insane! But to those wishing to know more! I share not what one seeks! But choose instead to only show what one may desire to know”

And desired to know more Christina’ did! Finding herself now coming closer to him, knowing that something about him was more than she wanted to know. But resist she could not! For his presence alone left her feeling it all up inside of her. 

As he then approached her slowly placing his hand on the side of her head, massaging his fingers slowly through her hair. Christina’ was now fully engaged to wanting to know more! More of his touch! Her need to be filled was here and in a big way! And feel it! She very much was! Feeling his hand upon her, every desire of wanting to know more! Was now wanting more! 

As he then placed both of his hands on her head sliding them slowly through her hair, as Christina’s body was now ready for his touch. A touch that she had been yearning for. To show her what she had been looking for, With him now looking at her as he then said 

“To know more, is to desire what one wants to feel! And if you need is to feel? Then my desire is to know you.”

The desire was here, Christina’ thoughts were here, my body was all his! And all he needed to do was feed my desire. The desire to feel every part of him!

Taking off his coat as he placed it on the ground, as he then looked to her placing his finger up to her lips. before saying to her 

“ I know your desire! Now let me know you! 

Christina’ was there! Her desire was now his to do with as he pleased! As he slowly slid his hand down the side of her face, sliding his fingers over  and under her shirt and across her chest! Christina’ heart was pounding! Her body was there in complete control of his hands. Christina’ could feel the sweat on her, ready for his body to be on her. 

For this girl might not be a bride to be, But for one night, She just may need a priest to exercise what ever he puts into her. For she was going to be screaming to the heavens above that hells fire was now burning inside of her, Feeling the heat from his touch, 

Feeling his lips slowly touching her, Pulling her closer feeling his chest up next to hers, With his hands slowly gliding across her back! She wanted this to last all night. To feel hells fire burn within her! As Her body was pulsating, To his very touch. A touch like no other to her. As he then slowly took off her shirt feeling his fingers slowly sliding across her breast! Feeling his breath as her body! now fully up against her as he then whispering to her ear. 

“Tonight my love I will know you as you desire!”

As the flames would ride higher! So would he! As he then slowly lay me down upon coat, sliding his hands through her hair. As Christina’ body was now on fire from the inside! Feeling the burn of his touch inside of her, slowly sliding his hands across her chest. Feeling and teasing her nipples, the sweat pouring from her. 

As he then Massaged her breasts with his hands, with his tongue dancing and slowly gliding around all around her neck. Up to her Christina’s cheek, As Christina’ lay there with her hands now firmly on him, pulling him tighter up against her. Feeling him rub all up against her, With her hands now slowly sliding down his back onto his ass feeling him. Rub himself all up and down her! Before slowly sliding his hands back across her stomach down to her pants. 

Looking at her as he then unzipped her pants sliding them off of her! As his fingers danced around in her! feeling his hands coming back up through her legs. Teasing her inside, as Christina held on! Feeling his breath on her neck as his fingers danced around in her. 

Before slowly Sliding his hands back  up her legs, slinging up to firmly grabbing a hold of her ass. As his tongue found its way all around her neck. Up and into her mouth, as his fingers danced away inside of her. 

Hell was definitely on fire that night! With his hand now firmly holding me against her, going in and out her. Feeling every finger as his hand danced around inside of her.

As he then raised back up taking off his shirt and pants! Just Before placing his body once again upon her. 

feeling his sweat as he then placed her hands around his back moving them up behind his head. 

Christina’ could now feel every bit of him going deep inside of her! Her hands now firmly grabbing a hold of his back 

As the Devil was now looking up to Christina Ricci’ saying

“Dam! I would give up hell just to be in her!” 

As there bodies were now becoming one, to the night!  as they then slowly made love on the roof not really caring if anyone was watching. For as the night went on so did he! For Christina’ had never made love to anyone like she did to him that night. 

But as good things come, they also have to go! 

But just before he would disappear forever into back into the night, he then turned to Christina’ asking her

“Do you want to know?”

With Christina’ now looking at him saying 

“Know what?

With him just looking at her before saying 

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

With Christina’ then asking 

“Who!”

As he then just laughed as he said

“I did!

“I killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

As he then just looked at her laughing as he then just vanished into the night never to seen again.

As the Raven behind her once again crowed

“NeverMore!” 

Just before it flew off into the night!

While him leaving her knowing that her every desire he did feel that night, leaving Christina’ even more fascinated to find out more about him. Drawing her closer to him. For to know his love, his insanity, to feel him once more! is to know the darkness that he has become!

Leaving her now standing there on the roof thinking to herself what about Johnny? Did he kill Johnny?

But she guessed that she will just have to wait until the morning, But if so, then Johnny would be

NeverMore

Leaving Christina Ricci’ then asking herself? Dose she now want to be 

NeverMore herself

Just like building a dream home requires careful planning and personal touches, promoting your business works best when you use strategies that make your brand stand out. One of the most effective, affordable, and lasting ways to do this is through [custom printed products](https://custom101prints.com/). From t-shirts to tote bags, these small tools can create a big impact.

Here are the **top 10 ways custom printed products help promote your business**:

# 1. Build Strong Brand Visibility

Every time someone wears your branded t-shirt or uses your printed water bottle, your business logo and name get noticed. This is like free advertising that travels everywhere your customers go.

# 2. Affordable Marketing

Compared to running TV ads or online campaigns, custom printing is budget-friendly. A batch of printed pens, mugs, or caps can spread your brand message for months without repeating costs.

# 3. Create Long-Lasting Impressions

Digital ads disappear after a few seconds, but a printed diary, calendar, or tote bag lasts much longer. Your brand stays in front of the customer every day, building trust over time.

# 4. Strengthen Professional Image

Just like a well-designed home reflects quality, custom-printed uniforms, folders, and stationery show professionalism. It helps customers see your business as reliable and trustworthy.

# 5. Encourage Word-of-Mouth Marketing

When your products look attractive, people naturally talk about them. Imagine someone asking, “Where did you get that cool bag?” and the answer includes your business name. That’s powerful organic promotion.

# 6. Perfect for Events and Trade Shows

If you’re attending expos or local fairs in Sydney, handing out custom printed goodies like pens, keychains, or notepads helps people remember you long after the event is over.

# 7. Boost Customer Loyalty

Customers feel valued when you give them free branded items. Whether it’s a coffee mug or a hat, they associate your business with generosity, making them more likely to return.

# 8. Promote Internally as Well

Custom printing is not just for customers. Staff uniforms, printed ID cards, or branded work gear make your team feel united. A strong team spirit translates into better service for clients.

# 9. Stand Out from Competitors

In industries like real estate, construction, or hospitality, many companies compete for attention. Unique printed products help your brand stand apart and be remembered.

# 10. Work Across All Industries

The beauty of custom printing is that it works for every type of business – from home builders like us in Sydney to restaurants, gyms, or tech startups. It’s versatile and always effective.

(Bahrain Company Formation 2025),"When is the Deadline for Existing Businesses to Implement Digital Payment Methods? (Bahrain Company Formation 2025)\
I still remember my first client meeting in Bahrain’s Financial Harbour—shimmering blue glass, the salty breeze from Bahrain Bay, and that feeling of excitement mixed with anxiety. We sat in a modern majlis. A tray of cardamom coffee passed around. It was just before Ramadan, so the usual hustle in Seef District slowed. But what struck me most wasn’t the architecture; it was the business owner’s frustration with regulatory changes—especially digital payment requirements. Fast forward to 2025, and nearly every serious entrepreneur I know is asking the same question: When is the deadline for existing businesses to implement digital payment methods?\
\
Alt text: Business people in a professional meeting, businessmen in suits discussing strategies, corporate professionals collaborating. set out in late 2024 to require all existing registered businesses—from cafés near the Diplomatic Area to fintech startups in Bahrain Bay—to enable customers to pay digitally. This push aligns with Bahrain’s Vision 2030 and is part of the government’s “Cashless Bahrain” strategy.\
\
According to Reuters (Jan 2025), over 82% of Bahrain-based businesses had shifted to at least one digital payment method by the end of Q1 2025, a leap from just 55% in early 2024.\
\
Official Deadline\
All existing commercial establishments must implement approved digital payment systems (including debit/credit, BenefitPay, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, etc.) by\
October 1st, 2025\
as mandated by MOICT regulations and enforced via Sijilat (Bahrain’s commercial registry portal).\
\
Non-compliance penalties: BD 500-1,500 in fines, and potential suspension of the Sijilat CR (Commercial Registration).\
Applies to all commercial entities, including free zone companies, branch offices, and SMEs.\
Exceptions: Sole traders with zero walk-in, non-retail, or strictly government B2B contracts may apply for conditional exemption (rarely granted after July 2025).\
\
More official info: Bahrain.com – Government Digital Payments\
I once faced a delay by missing the Ramadan cut-off for applications; learning to time CR updates pre-Eid saved my client BD 500 in late registration penalties. Always check religious holiday schedules—a very Bahrain-specific insider tip.\
Bahrain’s Business Environment in 2025\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain business district, corporate headquarters. to expand 4.7% in 2025. Financial services, ICT, and logistics are booming, with the Seef District becoming a fintech magnet. Bahrain’s ability to swiftly adapt policy (much faster than the UAE or Saudi Arabia, in my experience) is both an advantage and a challenge—you must stay alert.\
\
Over 11,400 new businesses registered in 2024 (Reuters), a record high.\
Digital payment volume via BenefitPay rose 51% year-on-year, dwarfing regional averages (Gulf News: Bahrain).\
Free zone clusters in Bahrain Bay and Hidd are attracting global e-commerce players, thanks to strong fintech/IT infrastructure.\
\
For entity types and advantages, see Bahrain Business Type Structures.\
Understanding the Digital Payment Mandate\
What Counts as a Digital Payment System?\
\
MOICT-approved electronic point-of-sale (POS) terminals (Visa/Mastercard compatible)\
BenefitPay (Bahrain’s national wallet)\
Mobile NFC options (Apple Pay, Samsung Pay)\
Online payment gateway (for e-commerce)\
\
Surprisingly, payment links via WhatsApp or Instagram Shops are not sufficient unless backed by a licensed Bahraini payment processor.\
Who Needs to Comply?\
\
Retail stores, cafés, gyms, beauty salons, consultancies, service companies, and even temporary pop-up shops.\
Branches of foreign companies operating in Bahrain.\
\
A common mistake: thinking “small turnover means exemption.” (I’ve seen several entrepreneurs misread the MOICT circular—be meticulous.)\
Step-by-Step: How to Comply (And Save Time & Money)\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, paperwork, business documents for MOICT digital payment compliance.\
2. Choose Your Payment Provider\
\
BenefitPay: Fastest approval, lowest cost for small/medium entities.\
  Set-up: BD 25–60 (one-time); transaction fee usually  Ramadan hours are shorter (9 am–2 pm); bring your own water and expect a 20-min business coffee slot with officials—relationship-building matters!\
\
4. Install Equipment and Test\
\
POS vendors will visit your premises (Seef, Diplomatic Area, etc.).\
Insist on full device demo before signing off—twice I’ve seen “activated” terminals fail live due to overlooked SIM set-up.\
Online-only? Test end-to-end with a real BD 1 payment.\
Update your payment signage in both Arabic and English.\
\
5. Submit Proof to MOICT\
\
Upload or drop off installation certificate.\
MOICT usually confirms within 48–72 hours.\
Tip: WhatsApp follow-up with your POS vendor accelerates the confirmation for your Sijilat CR.\

Budget Tip\
If starting with  Tangent: Did you know local business tradition still values a strong in-person majlis after closing a deal? Even in the digital era, Bahrain’s business culture blends high-tech with heritage—your payment terminal may be next to a tray of Arabic sweets.\
Common Mistakes and How to Prevent Them\
\
Ignoring MOICT emails: Every year, dozens lose their CR due to missed compliance reminders.\
Set a recurring reminder for quarterly Sijilat logins.\
Incomplete paperwork: MOICT will not accept “pending documents.”\
Checklists work—print out and double-tick every field before heading to Seef branch!\
Relying on WhatsApp or Instagram payment links: Not recognized unless backed by a licensed Bahraini processor.\
Forgetting business hours during Ramadan and religious holidays:\
  I once waited two weeks for a simple CR edit because I forgot Eid office closures. Always check Bahrain’s official holiday calendar!\
\
Regulatory Changes in 2025\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, legal documents, compliance audit for Bahrain digital payment.:\
  Mandates all retail and service businesses must enable at least one MOICT-approved digital payment solution by Oct 1, 2025.\
- Sijilat CRs not updated by this date will be suspended until compliance is proven.\
- Coordination with LMRA, Tamkeen, and the Central Bank of Bahrain ensures cross-agency enforcement—no more “silent extensions” as in previous years.\
For ongoing compliance/accounting needs: Accounting and Bookkeeping Services in Bahrain.\
Support and Resources: Who Can Help?\
\
Alt text: Professional business support, business advice, customer service for Bahrain business..\
- Need sponsorship for sectors still requiring Bahraini partners? See Local Sponsorship in Bahrain.\
- For multi-lingual signage and document translation, several vendors in Seef Mall are both fast and Sijilat-compliant.\
Bahrain Business Culture: What Sets It Apart\
Bahrain’s business etiquette is unique. Expect majlis-style meetings, with traditional coffee—even as you demo your new BenefitPay terminal. Ramadan brings shorter hours but stronger personal connections.\
But—unlike the UAE’s hierarchical “Wasta” (connections), Bahrain’s regulators are approachable, pragmatic, and responsive to entrepreneurs. (I’ve solved a documentation crisis by sharing tea with a MOICT official after a formal meeting—relationship-building still matters!)\
Comparatively, Bahrain offers simpler CR amendments and a more “open-door” regulatory approach than typically seen in Saudi Arabia or the UAE. This flexibility is ideal for agile firms or fast movers.\
FAQ: Digital Payment Mandate for Existing Bahrain Businesses\
Q1: What happens if I don’t meet the digital payment deadline by Oct 1, 2025?\
Failing to demonstrate a functioning MOICT-approved system results in temporary suspension of your Sijilat CR, business interruption, and fines from BD 500 to BD 1,500.\
Time-saving tip: Apply by early August to allow for processing delays during holiday periods.\
Q2: Can I use only WhatsApp or Instagram payment links for my business?\
No—social platform links don’t count unless they’re routed via a licensed Bahraini payment processor and integrated with your business’s Sijilat record.\
Q3: What’s the cheapest set-up for a micro-business or freelancer?\
BenefitPay offers starter packages for BD 25–40 with per-transaction fees under 2%. Consider Tamkeen grants if you’re Bahraini-owned.\
Compare options here: Bahrain Company Formation Cost.\
Q4: Do free zone companies need to comply with the digital payment mandate?\
Yes. All Bahrain-registered commercial entities, including those in free zones (BLZ, Bahrain Bay, etc.), must comply.\
More details: Free Zones in Bahrain.\
Q5: What’s the most common mistake during this process?\
Inadequate paperwork and missing key deadlines. Build a checklist, double-check signatures, and schedule in-person follow-ups for urgent CR updates.\

we chatted nearly every day and sometimes could chat for over 3 hours in the evening. I developed strong romantic feelings and I really thought this person felt the same way. I was reluctant to meet them at first as I thought they may not turn up. I voiced this concern with them and they reassured me that they would definitely turn up. 

They initiated the time and place to meet, which I agreed to as I wanted to fit around their schedule of when they were next in the UK. During the months leading up to our date they seemed excited like me and would often bring it up in conversation. 

So the coffee date was on Friday 15 August, in the morning but the person was a no show, I feel absolutely devastated. I just can't believe it really as I had travelled over 200 miles to meet the person and it was all for nothing. I spend a tonne of money on hair, makeup and on travel costs. It’s the humiliation aspect too; I turned up at the place all dressed up and staff knew I’d been stood up. One of the waitresses gave me a hug 🫂

Also the person has ghosted me and is not communicating at all. Any advice on the matter would really be appreciated, I am feeling like a right fool! 😢

I just can’t understand the logic to chat to someone for so long and to not turn up, especially when they made the arrangements. Do you think some people get a kick out of intentionally not turning up for dates? In a way, I want the person to contact me as I feel I need closure. On the other hand, I feel I need to move on from the situation. What would your advice be on the matter?

I wanna buy a better machine than what we currently have (old Breville) for my partner's birthday, especially as coffee recently became even more central in our lives because we had twins last year. We stopped drinking alcohol, sleeping, and socializing, so coffee is what gives us strength to get up every morning and take care of these amazing little bundle of joy who decide to wake up everyday at 5am (note that we also have a 4yo 🫠).
We don't have time anymore, but we have time enough to make and enjoy good coffee (good coffee and sex, that's all the dopamine boost we still have - I'm half kiddin' 😬).

Budget is around 1000/1200$ CAD, knowing we also need a new good grinder. But from a DS54 to Baratza... I know nothing except it has to be burr grinder. We don't need silence, we need good and various grinding choices to learn how to play with it.

From all the advice I already got, what I had in mind so far was either GCP or one of the Silvia if we wanna update our coffee mastering, OR Breville Bambino for more assistance. Although I'm wondering if, as neophytes, we would be able to get the subtleties of the temperature tunning thing. 

Summary :
  • we are not very rich
  • we have 3 kids under 4 and are as happy as exhausted
  • we love espresso (and we need it more than water right now)
  • we drink about 2 to 3 coffee a day
  • we don't really care about milk and barista thing
  • space isn't a problem
  • playing with mods such as the GCP wouldn't be a problem as my partner likes to tinker stuff, but do we really have time for this ?

So, from everything that exist, what do you recommend? I'm open to ANY suggestion in my budget (around 1000-ish) available in Canada. ",1,1755391593.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

On the “nerdier” side… I’m a huge World of Warcraft fan, been playing since my dad introduced me to it when I was 7 (alliance best faction imo). I also LOVE DnD, currently in 1 campaign and always in the mood to join more. I also have been getting into Warhammer 40k kudos to my back home friends (slowly building a Sororitas army!!). Always looking to get into more tabletop and online games!!

Other than that, I love movies- huge into horror and action/superhero movies but also love fun romcoms. Same with books too- love fantasy ofc as well!

If it’s any hint to my personality I love music and am rockin with things like Nickleback (saw them 1st row in the pit in Chicago), Taylor Swift, 3 Doors Down, Hollywood Undead, and really can get behind a lot of genres.

Just want to see if anyone shares some of my interests and would of course love more exploring buddies around the towns and surrounding areas! :)",1,1755391387.0,IowaCity,0,1.0,False
1msd0ri,https://www.reddit.com/r/SadPoems/comments/1msd0ri/michigan_burns/,Michigan burns,"Michigan doesn’t whisper,
it groans.
Every street carries the ache
of a place that’s been left behind.
Factories loom like mausoleums,
windows shattered,
machines rusted still—
their silence heavier
than the years when they fed families.
People live in shadows of industry,
their homes boarded up,
foreclosed, condemned,
entire neighborhoods
swallowed by weeds and weather.
Children grow up playing
in yards where the grass won’t grow,
watching their parents
count pennies under yellow light
just to keep the power on.
Abandoned houses sag on every block,
skeletons of lives once lived,
front porches collapsing into dirt.
Somebody once dreamed here—
weddings, barbecues,
Christmas lights strung on gutters—
but all that’s left
is plywood nailed across the windows
like coffins for the living.
The people stay anyway.
They work double shifts
for half a wage,
sell scrap metal to pay rent,
hold on to cars older than themselves.
Their hands ache, their lungs blacken,
but they push on
because leaving is a luxury
no one here can afford.
Detroit puts on its tourist mask—
gleaming stadiums,
shiny downtown bars—
but everyone knows
it’s just a trick of the light.
Drive a mile away,
and the streets are cracked open,
whole rows of houses
caved in on themselves.
Every block is a graveyard
of promises broken
by men in suits
who never set foot here.
Young men carry guns
because hope is too fragile.
They fight for scraps,
for pride, for nothing at all.
Every shot fired is another heartbeat lost,
another mother crying into her hands,
another family hollowed out
like the buildings that cage them.
And still—
people try to live.
They fall in love on cracked sidewalks,
smile under broken streetlamps,
gather in diners where the coffee tastes like rust
but at least it’s warm.
They find ways to survive
in a place that forgot them,
to carry on
where the houses rot
and the factories sink deeper into the dirt.
Michigan is a graveyard of industry,
but its people—
they are stubborn, scarred,
clinging to life
the way rust clings to iron.
Even as the city tears itself apart,
they keep breathing,
because what else is left?

In the wise words of my father, “industry left the people behind. Which lead to no jobs and fighting for scraps”",1,1755391367.0,SadPoems,0,1.0,False
1msczyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1msczyd/34f_us_for_your_new_nerdy_best_friend_inquire/,"34F, US, For your new nerdy best friend inquire within!","I'm rather nerdy. I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I can taste almost normally, I think coffee is the only thing that's truly weird/bad.) I'm noticing that in addition to the acrid, garbagey, chemically-gasoline smell I am often smelling like an intense floral soapy scent that shouldn't be there. Anyone else have this? It's specifically soap-like, which is odd because soap is more of a carrier, so I wonder if my sense of taste is involved in this one. ",1,1755391265.0,Parosmia,0,1.0,False

1mscygc,https://www.reddit.com/r/bridge/comments/1mscygc/memory_palace_loci_to_remember_spot_cards_in/,Memory palace (loci) to remember spot cards in bridge,"The time has come for my experiment to see if I can adapt memory palace (loci) to remember spot cards (pips) and sequence played in bridge.

This forum is very good at all things bridge so I am hoping I can get some help or inspiration.

There is a ton online about memory palaces but only one forum post I could find about applying it to bridge (which had no conclusions).  If I want to remember all 13 tricks in sequence, should I use PAPA or PAOX, and then do I need something for the per-trick lead (relative to declarer)?  In that case I need 5 items per room, or maybe I do PAOPA.  The O could just have 4 codes corresponding to whether LHO, Dummy, RHO, or Declarer led the trick.  

I am thinking about placing the cards in a clockwise sequence, something like center (coffee table when you walk in the door), left wall, window wall at back, right wall.  That corresponds to the trick sequence, but not sure to keep them in their seat location or sequence per trick. Do I need an extra marker?

I see that if you go to the previous room, most of the time it's obvious who won the trick to be sure of the next lead, but sometimes you have to go back a few for it to be clear.  Tradeoffs on having the extra item per trick?

Also once you populate all 13 loci, I saw something that says you have to erase or ""burn"" them otherwise your mind gets overloaded. Do I reuse the same palace for each new board?

Should I use the Major System? (referring to a system to remember numbers)

Lot's to think about .... any ideas would be welcome, anyone tried this or can find any references please let me know.

If you don't know the terms PA, PAO, PAOX, Major System just google under memory palaces - there is a ton of information online about the techniques. 

The background is that I am relatively bad at quickly remembering random sequences (like a door code or phone number) but good at long term recall on relative or relational things.  I'm ok at honors but not so good at 9s 8s and 7s.  I realize that on many hands you don't need to know the spot cards but occasionally it helps.  As I am playing more at a higher level sequence for defensive signals can also matter or help you build a more refined picture.

-To summarize this- I started with green tea pearls, freshly harvested from the Heart of the Himalayas ⛰️. The Dry tea pearls were put in a piping hot pan and roasted, while being stirred constantly.

The first thing I noticed was the smell; The roasted soybeans and almonds aroma as the tea went from a dark forest green to a faded olive. The whole room filled with a robust nutty aroma. Thats when then the spooky action started to happen. As the stems of the tea buds started to fill with air, they started to expand like tiny cheese puff, then the pearls began to unfurl.

The tea on the roasting pan started to move on its own. Growing, reaching and ultimately leaping out of the pan.. The stems started to pop like popcorn, causing the tea to flick off the hot pan. At that point the tea was considered roasted. This took approximately 2-3 mins.

Once cooled, the flavor of the tea resembled burnt soy, slightly bitter but edible. I loved the texture, it was eating tiny cheese puffs. There was no green flavor at all but the aroma was a sharp and piercing green.

When I added water and brewed the tea, it changed dramatically. The aroma was of steamed edamame and yam. The flavor was intense, it resembled roasted cauliflower with a sharp sting on the upper pallet. A deep ancient Green, more of a sensation than a flavor. A bold yet sharp sensation that lasted only seconds; It was odd.

The tea liquid from the un-roasted pearls was light green. The roasted tea liquid became light amber and eventually a beautiful translucent orange 🍊.

• Should I try roasting lighter and darker              blends, what do you think?

• Is this something you would try?

1mscqi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1mscqi1/wayland_opengl_latency_test/,Wayland OpenGL Latency Test,"Inspired by a [somewhat recent post](https://mort.coffee/home/wayland-input-latency/) about cursor latency on Wayland, I decided to measure input lag in a real use case of gaming. With an SDL-based OpenGL game, I can compare across X11 and Wayland, both natively and through XWayland. Using a 240Hz camera and a 60Hz monitor, I count from 0 when the mouse is clicked up to the camera frame where screen activity becomes visible.

For native Wayland as well as XWayland, I use GNOME 48. For Xorg, I use Openbox without a compositor. I select the client type with the `SDL_VIDEODRIVER`env var. On each tested platform, I also use three different game configurations that pertain to latency, yielding nine permutations in total. `Vsync`is the standard OpenGL behavior that lets the driver handle all frame timing. `GLFinish`forces the game to wait for a buffer swap to occur before advancing to a new frame. `Max FPS`sets an in-game FPS cap of 59, just below the monitor refresh rate.  In all cases, V-sync is never disabled. Here is a table of the data I gathered and the average latency of each test in milliseconds.

[Xonotic click-to-photon latency](https://preview.redd.it/jfobzhmjxgjf1.png?width=769&format=png&auto=webp&s=cde62ebf2da29ca35103d21c939ea440bbb32d7d)

Interpreting this, what is immediately obvious is that the native Wayland client behaves differently, while the X11 client is, within margin of error, identical on both Xorg and XWayland. The native Wayland client benefits from not having exorbitant buffering in the standard V-sync case, but it for some reason does not benefit from having GLFinish thrown in, giving the X11 client an advantage in this rather obscure scenario. Capping the frame rate unsurprisingly yields the best results in all cases. The data suggests that Xorg may have a lead here, but this specific measurement is highly variable and prone to imprecision, so I wouldn't make such a conclusion without sufficient, high-quality data.

It's also important to note that there are many factors at play. Different drivers and hardware setups may behave differently, and not all Wayland desktops are equal. While I have no empirical data to back it up, Sway does not feel as responsive as GNOME does.

Conclusion: Wayland with a competent compositor does not seem to add latency to legacy games. Games ported to Wayland natively may exhibit different behavior that may or may not be desired, but the latency remains just as good under optimal conditions.

I didn't expect to go this long, as I started without really planning of preparing for it. I have to end the streak soon, likely tomorrow, because I'm out of ""real"" food, with almost nothing remaining apart from a tub of protein powder and random condiments. All I have left in terms of vegetables are pickles, olives, and ketchup. But it was fun, and I'm proud that I managed use up all the misc stuff in my pantry so that everything ran out at about the same time. It was motivating finding ways to be creative with the ingredients I already had and it's interesting how just the concept of doing a challenge changed my perspective. There are certain ingredients that I usually don't like cooking with because they are tedious and require more prep like dry lentils or flour, but in the perspective of a challenge, the trove of possibilities that they provide made it exciting. you can make basic things like couscous and rice taste really nice with just oil and seasonings. as I grew prouder of my streak, the idea to end it to get something inessential like an energy drink became ridiculous. 

next step is planning out what is the least amount I have to buy to get a solid streak going again. Items I am planning on getting:

 * Frozen vegetables of all kinds
 * Rice
 * Pasta
 * Couscous
 * Flour
 * Oil
 * Peanut butter
 * Meats, whatever is on sale
 * Tuna, sardines, mackerels, oysters, etc., canned
 * **TEA** (I didn't plan for it so I ran out almost immediately so that was a bummer because I wanted chilled tea to be my replacement for energy drinks. instant coffee it was)

But I blew into town with a storm gnawin’ at my heels, thunder barkin’ close enough to make windows rattle. First thought on my mind was food. Beth’s — a traveler’s first-and-last stop for a hundred miles any way you fly is the bastard cross between truck stop, diner, and motel.



Beth herself reminded me of Sal right off — a mother hen fattenin’ up strays, eyes sharp enough to know what kind of trouble you’re haulin’ but kind enough not to ask.



She fed me to the gills with pie. My God, that woman can bake — crust flakin’ like it owed her money, sugar sweet enough to wash the road dust from my bones.



Night rolled in with the storm. I holed up in one of the ramshackle huts they got the gall to call rooms. Roof leaked in two corners, wallpaper curlin’ like it was tryin’ to escape, but hell — the bed was clean, sheets smelled more of bleach than sweat, and no pests came crawlin’ out to greet me. That’s a win in my book.



Breakfast was cheap, coffee was free — tar black, bitter as old sin — but it kept the wheels turnin’.



Local crowd was about as colorful as you’d expect early on a Friday mornin’… least, I think it was a Friday. Days get slippery in Mayvale, slidin’ past like cards in a crooked shuffle. Folks nursed the coffee like medicine, eyes glued anywhere but each other, and I got the sense half of ‘em weren’t awake... and the other half wished they weren’t.



That’s when I crossed paths with Shamblin’ Joe. Old gator hunter by trade, though trade’s a kind word for it. Luck soured on him the day Big Bess clamped down and near took his leg clean off. Now he hobbles ‘round Mayvale like a bad omen with a grin too wide for his own good. Talks more to his flask than to folks, but I’ll be damned if he don’t know things he shouldn’t.



Joe laid three truths on me that morning, straight gospel and twice as heavy. Don’t go pokin’ at whatever’s stirrin’ over at the high school. Cross the rainbow if I had a death wish. And last -maybe worst of all - you can’t always save Bishop. He didn’t explain, just let it hang in the smoke between us, like I oughta already know.



Well, I know now, don’t I? Ain’t no clearer way to put it - school’s crawlin’ with heart-eatin’ Aztecs wearin’ letterman jackets like it’s the most natural thing in the world. And as for rainbows - hell, if I never lay eyes on one again, it’ll still be too soon.



But those came later - after the wheels came off and Mayvale showed its real teeth.

\[Dhyd's research note: The following excerpts have been reconstructed from pages of a standard school notebook and random refuse. Considerable text loss is present. Writing samples confirm the connection. Timeline not establishable.\]



Presented to you is a collection of torn pages from a standard school notebook and random refuse. Several sheets are splattered with an indiscernible sticky residue - dark in patches and tacky to the touch. The first page presented to you starts:



\[Illegible text\]... with great care. But I noticed the teens \[Slanted? Leered?\] at me as I moseyed about, all narrowed eyes and chewin’ mouths... Not what I would expect in a berg like this.



Crime's s’posed to come with size \[Rest of sentence missing.\]



\[Tumbled out? Turned up?\] at the old fairgrounds at some point later on in my walkabout. Dead rides groanin’ in the wind, weeds growin’ up where the ticket booths used to be, smell of rust and popcorn long gone stale. Met the clowns there - paint cracked, suits hangin’ loose, eyes clear as a winter morning. Probably only sensible people in this whole \[Town? Country? Text missing.\] got names, minds, rules - more than I can say for most of Mayvale.



Greeted by a man went by Mad Hatter, iron handshake like he was testing the bones in my hand just to count 'em, and a laugh that tolled through the dead rides like a church bell nobody asked for.



Treated me better than Kin, he did. Don't trust him further than I could throw him. 



Never trust the Prince among paupers.



\[Section following this sentence is heavily stained and unreadable.\]



\[Fragment retrieved from the remains of a crumbling bank vault.\]



Leaving Hatter’s was a ride, lemme tell you. Man’s got a way of makin’ you feel like family while he’s slippin’ a knife between your ribs - not literal, but the kind that digs in deep all the same. Walkin’ outta that fairground, I had the itch between my shoulders, like spider silk strands tied me to the dead rides with him holdin’ the knots.



\[A portion of text is unreadable due to smudging.\]



Sorry, heard somethin’ at the door and had to check the locks. Can’t be too careful right now - shadows will lean in too close if you ain’t lookin’.



But where was I… ah, yeah.



Beth was waitin’ with pie and a cuppa joe when I stumbled back - like she knew the cold had wormed its way clear to my bones. Steam curled off that mug like a blessing, and the pie - hell, salvation and just the right kind of sweet to scrub the aftertaste of the Mad Prince clean outta my mouth… and every bit loosened the lingerin' web. Sittin’ there under her watch, with pie in my gut and steam in the air - I felt almost human again. Even if the walls listened. 



\[Document ends abruptly in the middle of a page\]



\[Scrawled diagonally on a napkin behind a forgery of The Last Supper, date unclear.\]



Woke up to scratching under the floorboards… again. Ain’t the first night, won’t be the last. The old woman next door swears it’s rats - but, sin above, I’ve known rats. Rats don’t whisper.



Reckon it might be time to move on. Been roostin’ here longer than’s healthy for me. But Mayvale’s a hard place to find a safe nest - tough peanuts in a town where every shadow’s already claimed and you don't wanna meet the landlords.

## key Features Analysis

the vacuum box market in 2025 is filled with several models, each boasting unique features. The most advanced options stand out due to their innovative designs, durable materials, and user-friendly functionality.

**High-Grade Material Construction**

The most effective vacuum boxes are constructed from BPA-free, food-grade plastics, often Tritan, which is known for its durability and resistance to scratches and odors. Glass options are also popular for their non-porous qualities and aesthetic appeal. The quality of the sealing mechanism is equally vital, typically featuring silicone gaskets and robust locking clips to ensure an airtight seal. The durability of the materials ensures longevity and reliability, making these boxes a worthwhile investment.

**Advanced Vacuum Sealing Technology**

Sophisticated vacuum boxes incorporate integrated vacuum pumps or compatibility with worldwide pump attachments, allowing for speedy and efficient air extraction. Some models feature digital indicators that display the vacuum level, while others automatically maintain the desired pressure, ensuring consistent preservation. The effectiveness of the vacuum sealing technology is paramount for maximizing the lifespan of stored items.**Modular and Stackable Design**

Space-saving designs are crucial in modern homes. Advanced vacuum boxes often feature modular designs that allow for easy stacking, both when full and when empty. This promotes efficient use of storage space in pantries, refrigerators, and closets. The ergonomic shapes and standardized sizes maximize compatibility across different models and brands.

**Smart Connectivity and Monitoring**

Certain high-end vacuum boxes connect to smartphone apps via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, enabling users to monitor the internal environment and receive notifications regarding spoilage or loss of vacuum pressure. Integrated sensors track temperature, humidity, and air quality, providing data-driven insights for optimal storage conditions.This connectivity enhances the proactive management of stored items.

## Core Benefits

The core benefits of using vacuum boxes extend beyond simple storage and institution. They directly impact food preservation, space optimization, and overall convenience for users.**Improved Food Preservation**

Vacuum boxes significantly extend the shelf life of food by reducing exposure to oxygen,which is a primary cause of spoilage. For exmaple, perishable items like fruits, vegetables, and cooked meats can last up to three times longer in a vacuum-sealed environment compared to traditional containers. This reduces food waste and saves money on groceries in the long run.

**Enhanced Space Optimization**

By removing air, vacuum boxes compress items, freeing up valuable space in refrigerators, pantries, and closets. This is notably beneficial for apartment dwellers or anyone with limited storage areas. Stackable designs further amplify space-saving capabilities, allowing for neat and organized layouts.

**Protection from Moisture, Pests, and Mold**

The airtight seal of vacuum boxes prevents moisture from entering, guarding against mold growth and insect infestations. This is especially important for items like clothing, linens, and documents that can be ruined by humidity or pests. Using vacuum boxes ensures these valuables remain protected and in pristine condition.

**simplified Meal Prepping**

Vacuum boxes are ideal for meal prepping.Individual portions of pre-cooked meals can be stored in vacuum boxes,keeping them fresh and ready to eat throughout the week. This is not only convenient for busy individuals but also promotes healthier eating habits and better portion control.

**Organized and Clutter-Free Living**

From storing seasonal decorations to organizing craft supplies, vacuum boxes promote a more organized and clutter-free living environment. The clear design of many vacuum boxes allows for easy identification of contents, eliminating the need to rummage through piles of storage containers.

**What types of items can be stored in vacuum boxes?**

Vacuum boxes are incredibly versatile and can be used to store a wide variety of items, including food (such as fruits, vegetables, meats, and cereals), clothing, linens, documents, photographs, and small electronic devices. However, they are not suitable for storing sharp objects or items that require constant ventilation.

**How often do I need to re-vacuum the boxes?**

The frequency of re-vacuuming depends on the quality of the box and the nature of the stored item. Generally, high-quality vacuum boxes maintain a seal for several weeks or even months. However, it is recommended to check the vacuum level periodically and re-vacuum if you notice any loss of pressure.food items, in particular, may require more frequent re-vacuuming to ensure optimal preservation.

**Are vacuum boxes dishwasher-safe?**

Many vacuum boxes are dishwasher-safe, especially those made from high-quality plastics or glass. Though,it is indeed always best to check the manufacturer’s instructions before placing them in the dishwasher. the vacuum pumps and sealing components shoudl typically be washed by hand to prevent damage.

**Are ther any foods that should not be stored in vacuum boxes?**

Certain foods,such as soft cheeses and raw mushrooms,are not ideal for vacuum sealing as they may develop undesirable textures or flavors. Additionally, cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower release gases that can affect the seal.

***Wednesday***

Geraldine left the private living room and stepped into the vast kitchen that they’d passed earlier — the kind that felt right for a place this size. She remembered Quent saying the guys all had rooms, and out of habit, she looked over her shoulder to the hallway that ran down the right side of the room where she’d left Sam.

The corridor was absurdly long, with more doors than a hospital wing — at least a dozen, not including the open archway at the far end. Surely not all of them were bedrooms. Maybe some were bathrooms. She was almost tempted to go and look, but it would’ve felt rude since Quent hadn’t said she could.

She crossed to the kitchen island, where Quent sat on one of the barstools, staring out the kitchen window over the spotless kitchen sink. “Hey,” she said, not entirely sure of where she stood with the divine soldiers when Sam wasn’t around.

He turned his head towards her, straightening up in his seat. “You get kicked out, huh?”

She shrugged, like it had been inevitable, closing the distance between them. “He’s talking to the healer. It’s better if I’m not there.”

“They could be a while.”

Geraldine slid onto the corner stool and interlocked her fingers, stretching them out across the island. She was cautiously encroaching on his space, ready to pull back at the first flicker of danger in his expression. “Yes, I know.”

The silence hung for long, uncomfortable seconds while Geraldine watched her slow-moving fingers for something to do.

Eventually, Quent snorted. “Would you like to watch some TV, darlin’? There’s one over there,” he thumbed at the enormous living room behind him with the fireplace, and plenty of rugs and sofas for seating. Honestly, it was bigger than some people’s apartments. “Or if you want the full theatre experience, I can queue up something in the movie room.”

Geraldine’s eyes widened in shock. “You have a *movie* room?”   

Quent waggled his eyebrows, but it was all wrong since everything below those brows stayed blank; like he’d copied the move from someone else without realising there was so much more to it than just the eyebrows.

“What would *you* like to watch?” Geraldine asked, not wanting to presume she had the right to choose.

“I don’t care. This is more to give you something to do, since it’s apparent you don’t want to go back upstairs.”

“It’s not that I don’t want to, but if I go home without Sam, they’re going to ask questions that I’ll refuse to answer, and it’ll get loud. And if Sam finds out they shouted at me, he’ll get mad at them, and I don’t want that either. This is between Sam and his therapist and no one else until he says otherwise.”

Quent continued to watch her, though this time his lips twitched ever so slightly. It wasn’t much, but she’d take it. “How would you like to watch the anniversary 2Cello Concert that was put on at Arena di Verona?” he asked, like it was a perfectly normal question to pose.

To Geraldine, it was anything but. Her breath stuttered in shock. “You can’t be serious,” she gasped when she could finally speak. “The one from two weeks ago? You have a *recording* of that?” 

“Clefton got it for you. It seems the boys are big fans of his, and they gave him the pre-production footage, which Nuncio whipped up into DVD quality because the little toad was bored that night. The movie room will make it feel like you’re right there in the audience.”

Every cell in Geraldine’s body screamed *‘YES’,* but loyalty, love and guilt all pulled her the other way. Sam was just as big a 2Cellos fan as she was, and it didn’t feel right to watch it without him.

Quent noticed her hesitation, because he noticed everything. “Tell you what. Let’s pretend this conversation never happened and you come with me,” he said, rising out of his seat so smoothly it was almost serpentine. He slipped a hand under her elbow and assisted her off the kitchen stool, then guided her towards the long hallway she’d been looking at before.

His grip was gentle, but Gerry only liked being held like that by Sam. She eased herself free, careful not to offend. “Seriously, how many of you are staying here?”

“I don’t think this is meant for us. At least, not us alone. There are king-sized beds, pullout sofas and trundle beds in every bedroom, and a bathroom for every two bedrooms, not including the two master suites that each have their own ensuites.”

He gave her enough time to look in each of the rooms that had open doors for her curiosity to be assuaged.

“Do you think it might be for whoever’s working with Mason? Sort of a true gryps motel-slash-barracks? Feels like you could house a battalion in here.”

“With the exception of those on the border, the entire pryde is only one step away from New York City. I think this is a stopgap until everyone upstairs gets their heads around the fact that we can be here as soon as we’re needed.”

“Except you can’t be where you don’t know to be, can you?”

*Yesterday* had certainly proven that.

Quent stilled, his eyes sliding sideways to her, and for a second Geraldine wondered if she’d said too much. “True,” he admitted, though the pause said more than the word itself.

Then he began walking again.

*That’s it? True?*

 “What will you be doing while I’m watching the concert? No disrespect intended, but I’ve seen your face when we play 2Cellos in the car. You’d rather file your beak with an angle grinder.”

That earned her a real smile. “How long have you been working on that one?” he asked, taking her through the archway into yet another living room. This one, though, was more like a family-friendly room with couches that were more designed to slump in and eat pizza, unlike the more formal one out the front.

“Two…maybe three seconds?”

Quent walked her through the room, doing a giant U-turn to another archway on the same wall as the one they’d just come through. “You are good for him,” he said, passing the half-bath to a large sliding door that revealed a true theatre with six rows of four seats on either side of the aisle. “I think Mica was right about you in the beginning, but you’ve changed for the better, and in doing so, you’ve improved Sam.”

“He improved me, too,” Geraldine insisted, wanting Quent to acknowledge that.

He nodded with a slight smile instead and headed to the back left corner of the room. “Do you want some popcorn or snacks?” he asked, gesturing to the same wall on the other side of the room where a mini concession stand covered the space, including sliding glass doors that held ice creams and different-sized Styrofoam drink containers. “Help yourself. Robbie keeps them topped up for us.”

“This is crazy!” she said, after sniffing one of the smaller Styrofoam cups and deducing it was iced coffee (not something she enjoyed) before switching it out for a large strawberry milkshake. Her next selection was a couple of Hershey bars from the chocolate shelf.

“Sit wherever you want, sweetie. I’ll let Sam know where you are when he comes out.”

Geraldine took the aisle seat on the right, halfway down. The seats were leather and reclinable, not that she had any intention of sitting back with her favourite artists about to grace the screen.

The lights dimmed, and then the wall bloomed with light and sound, the echoing melody of two cellos filling the space with powerful reverence.

\* \* \*

*Kill me now. Pleeeeeease,* Rubin begged, which caused Quent to snicker. Sitting in on a therapy session with Sam had to be even worse than sitting through the exams, and Quent didn’t envy his clutch-mate at all. The problem was, Rubin couldn’t leave. Not unless the healer pulled rank and dismissed him. Their orders from War Commander Angus were clear: eight hours, no exceptions.

*You could ask the healer if it’s okay if you sit out here with me. Between our reflexes and their presence, nothing can touch him, and it’s not like he can get far if he chooses to run.*

*He won’t run. He wants this too much for his friends.*

*Then ask, dumbass, and get the fuck out of there ASAP.*

Rubin appeared in the kitchen moments later, where he melted into the seat and smacked his head down on the island. “That was painful,” he groaned, covering his head with both arms, and adding four more for good measure. “Is it too late to volunteer to go back to the front lines?” he asked from under the pile. “I promise I’ll never attack another healer again for as long as I live, I swear…”

“Serves you right for laughing at me when they were in exams.” Quent gave his brother a rough pat on the shoulder on his way past the island and into the butler’s pantry to the right of the kitchen sink. He came back with two shot glasses full of ambrosia. “Here,” he said, offering his brother one.  “It’s not much, but it takes the edge off.”

Rubin pulled back, his eyes widening as he realised what his brother had. “Fuck, yes!” he cried, lunging for his glass. It was downed a heartbeat later, with Rubin poking a forked tongue into the glass to lick up any traces of the divine substance. “I needed that.”

“Was it really that bad?”

Rubin merely shot his brother a stink eye.

And Quent snickered.

The streets below are broken. Cars rusted where they died. Windows blown. The dead move without meaning. Shuffling. Waiting.

And him.

He moves down the street with a pack too heavy. Stops often. Drinks from a bottle. Wipes his face with the back of his hand. Thinks he is alone. He is not.

I keep him in the glass. The sun catches it but I stay low. Old habits. The rifle clean. Always clean. Bolt oiled. Stock worn smooth where my cheek has known it a thousand times. I carried it before. In another place. In another life. The same rifle. The same weight.

I could take him now. One breath. One squeeze. He would be gone. But the dead would take what he carries. I wait. Patience. Patience is the thing.

He passes the diner. Rusted stools. Counters eaten by rot. I remember the girl pouring coffee. Her hair red. Her laugh. She is gone. The world is gone. The hunger plays tricks.

He goes into the pharmacy. I sight the door. Count. My mind still counts without asking. He comes out quick. A bottle in his pack. He does not know I saw. He does not know anything.

The light fades. The streets red and then black. He goes to the hardware store. The sign rusted and swinging. He looks once and then he is inside.

I kneel. The glass fixed to the door. Silence. Then the scrape of what is no longer human. The sound I know. I feel it before I hear it.

A crash. A cry cut short. I wait for him to come out. He does not.

The thing staggers into the street. A woman once. Her mouth working. Her eyes gone. She drags him with her. Chewing. I lower the rifle.

I watch until she is gone. The street empty again.

I sit back against the stone. There is no anger. No grief. Only the weight that does not leave. Another man gone. Another pack wasted.

Even the strong go under. Even the trained. I know this.

I rise. Sling the rifle. The town waits. Wide and ruined. Somewhere there is another man. Another pack.

over the past month and a half, i was given ketorilac + doliprane (to be taken daily) paracetamol and sumatriptan as a rescue med. i forgot the doses but none of these worked. all of these medications i was given abroad.

fast forward to when i’m getting home from vacation. i stopped taking all medications because i was scared of overuse. it was a 9hr long flight, and i did have a migraine but it was bearable, maybe 6.5/10 pain. it was a saturday, i came home and all of my symptoms were manageable with natural at home remedies until last  tuesday. i was on a regular eating and sleeping schedule. i could function! 

but tuesday was a bitch! 😭 i woke up with excruciating head pain at 7 am and had to go to the emergency room. i was out of there by 4 pm, and was prescribed amitriptyline as a preventative. i was instructed to take 25mg every day at 8 pm. my pain for the rest of that week was tolerable ranging from 2-4/10 pain. 

but the side effects are what hit me. i have unrelenting fatigue, i feel groggy every day, my emotions feel flat, and everything feels like an out of body experience. like, i could do something right now, and five minutes later it’ll feel like that was a whole other person. sometimes i’m questioning if i’m even me in the present moment. i’ve been having nightmares, vivid dreams and hallucinations. i also had debilitating constipation that almost sent me to the hospital. my stomach hasn’t made a sound in days. i just don’t feel normal and i hate it! i feel like this is too much for migraines that could just be seasonal. my head pain has gone down, but it’s only been two weeks since i started the amitriptyline, and all i want is to get off this drug :( but i am terrified that my pain will return ten fold. 

anyway — if you made it this far, thanks for listening to my ted talk. i’m not really looking for any advice, i just had to get this off my chest. but if you have any advice at all that could improve my situation, it wouldn’t hurt to share 💔💔",3,1755389576.0,migraine,3,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The overall composition of a rug determines its longevity and suitability for high-traffic areas.The rugs listed below will offer unique features and values.

**Material Composition:** The primary material significantly impacts a rug's durability, texture, and maintenance requirements. Top-quality blue and green area rugs are typically crafted from wool, synthetic fibers like polypropylene, or a blend of both. Wool rugs offer remarkable softness, resilience, and resistance to stains, are generally more expensive. Polypropylene rugs are known for their affordability, stain resistance, and ease of cleaning, making them ideal for homes with children or pets. Blended materials offer a balance of durability, comfort, and cost-effectiveness.

**Weave and Construction:** The weave and construction method determine the rug's density, texture, and overall appearance. Hand-knotted rugs are prized for their intricate designs and exceptional durability, but come at a premium price. Machine-made rugs,typically woven or tufted,provide a more affordable option with consistent quality. The pile height, referring to the length of the fibers, influences the rug's comfort and warmth. Shorter pile rugs are easier to clean and suitable for high-traffic zones, while longer pile rugs offer a softer feel and a more luxurious appearance.

**Colorfastness and Fade Resistance:** The ability to resist fading, especially under direct sunlight, is a crucial feature. High-quality blue and green area rugs are treated with colorfast dyes that prevent the colors from bleeding or fading over time. Look for rugs that are specifically labeled as fade-resistant or designed for outdoor use, as these are typically more resilient to sunlight and weather exposure.

**Size and Shape Options:** Area rugs come in a variety of sizes and shapes to accommodate different room layouts and design aesthetics. Standard sizes include rectangular, square, round, and runner rugs. Choosing the right size is essential for creating a balanced and visually appealing space. A rug that is too small can make the room feel disjointed,while a rug that is too large can overwhelm the space. common sizes for living rooms are 8x10 or 9x12 feet, while smaller rugs are suitable for bedrooms, entryways, or accent areas. Runners are ideal for hallways or narrow spaces.

**Pattern and Design:** The pattern and design significantly contribute to the rug's overall aesthetic appeal. Blue and green area rugs offer a wide range of options, from geometric patterns and abstract designs to floral motifs and customary Persian styles. Consider the existing decor and color palette of the room when selecting a pattern. A bold,eye-catching design can serve as a focal point,while a subtle,understated pattern can complement the existing furnishings.

**Backing Material:** High-quality rugs feature a durable and supportive backing material that prevents the rug from slipping and protects the flooring underneath. Common backing materials include jute, cotton, and latex. Latex backing provides excellent grip and is ideal for hardwood floors, while jute backing offers a more natural and eco-kind option. Consider using a rug pad for added cushioning, protection, and slip resistance, regardless of the backing material.

## Core Benefits

Blue and green area rugs offer a wide range of benefits beyond their aesthetic appeal, enhancing the functionality and comfort of any living space.

**Creating a Calming environment:** Blue and green are often associated with nature, peace, and tranquility. A blue and green area rug can instantly transform a room into a serene sanctuary, promoting relaxation and reducing stress. The colors can evoke feelings of being surrounded by water and lush greenery, creating a calming atmosphere that is ideal for bedrooms, living rooms, or meditation spaces.

**Adding a Touch of Nature Indoors:** Bringing the outdoors in is a prevailing trend in interior design. Blue and green area rugs can seamlessly integrate natural elements into the home,connecting indoor spaces with the outside world. The colors can mimic the hues of the sky, sea, and foliage, creating a sense of harmony and balance. This is notably beneficial for those living in urban environments who crave a connection with nature.

**Versatile Color Palette:** Blue and green are incredibly versatile colors that can complement a wide range of interior styles. They pair well with neutral tones like white, gray, and beige, and also bolder colors like yellow, orange, and pink. A blue and green area rug can serve as a versatile foundation for a room's color scheme, allowing you to experiment with different accent colors and decor elements.

**Defining spaces:** Area rugs are an effective way to define separate areas within a larger room. In open-concept living spaces, a blue and green area rug can visually delineate the living area from the dining area or create a cozy reading nook. By anchoring furniture within the rug, you can create a sense of cohesion and association, making the room feel more inviting and functional.

**Adding Warmth and Texture:** In addition to their aesthetic benefits, area rugs also add warmth and texture to a room. A plush, high-pile blue and green rug can provide a soft and comfortable surface underfoot, making the space feel cozier and more inviting. The texture of the rug can also add visual interest to the room, creating a more dynamic and layered look.

I feel lost and numb.,"Okay so here it goes. found a really great Muslim guy. We immediately got our families involved and started speaking. However, we got very close before nikkah. He started making me food during my studies, he would consistently get me coffee, he bought me flowers a few times, he wrote me kind lettters, etc. (my mom knew about these). but above all of that, he was incredibly soft spoken and patient and a lot of his mindset aligned with mine, regarding politics islam and morals. I truly saw myself building a beautiful life with him. And I will say we both became far more religious because of each other. However, things have been complicated due to family. I won’t go into detail. But there was a lot of family mess. And, after one year of us speaking, his mother told us her son isn’t ready for marriage? Which felt like a huge lead on then disappointment for both me and my family. 

Anyway, I obviously realize I can’t keep speaking to him if he isn’t ready. But I just don’t know what to do now. My family doesn’t like his family. And I’m afraid that my heart is attached to him. And I’m afraid I won’t find another man who understood me and loved me the way he did. He told me he won’t speak to anyone else because he isn’t capable of doing so. He asked me to do the same. That we will focus on getting our degrees and return to each other. But I’m afraid that’s cutting off our naseeb? I’m also afraid that his parents won’t be great to me. I know he’s amazing but aren’t good in laws also rlly important? I don’t know maybe I’m judging this based off the wrong things. 

He was truly an incredible guy but I know what we were doing wasnt completely halal. I need advice and reassurance for moving forward. I don’t want to lose myself. But everytime I try to move forward, I think of how good he was to me. And how I’m afraid I won’t have that again. I didn’t grow up in the best environment, so for me, he was my hope of building a loving and kind and healthy home. 

Other times, however, I think of how his family hurt my feelings. And my families feelings. But I don’t want to base my decision on solely family. Really good people can come from harsh families. Mine is not perfect at all either we certainly have our huge problems as well. I’ve cut off all contact with him now. I’m unclear how to move forward. ",4,1755389156.0,islam,2,1.0,False

1msc3jx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1msc3jx/missing_limbs_part_2/,Missing Limbs (Part 2),"Arriving at the house, I was a bit later than some of the other officers. I stepped out of my car, sipping my coffee one last time before leaving it in the cup holder. I closed my door and walked to the front of Julia's apartment building. To get inside you had to punch in a code that would release the locks on the door. After some beeps, the door unlocked and I walked into the elevator and hit the 6th floor button. While in the elevator I looked in the corner, it had a camera. Making a mental note of that I stepped out of the doors as the elevator opened. The floor was a hard laminate that clicked as my dress shoes paced across it to her room. 

The apartment was not all that impressive in size and with half the department canvasing the scene it was even more cramped. There was no sign of a forced entry on the front door. Whoever did this was either a skilled locksmith or used another way in. Being on the 6th floor, I found that hard to believe.  Julia claimed she had no friends so the theory I went with was that the person who did this was skilled but not a killer, Skilled Amputator perhaps. One of the officers noticed me and walked over as I slipped on my gloves. 

“Hey there Rick, what's the word?” He said as he shook my hand. 

James Dalton was a bright kid, he had served in the military for 4 years, gotten his degree in Criminology while he was in and was shooting for the FBI eventually. His black hair slicked back smoothly was always messed up after chasing a drunk or a graffiti artist. 

“Dunno, in this case, some of the details don’t make sense. The woman claims she had a hand and now she doesn’t. Seems insane you could take someone’s hand in a single night and leave no trace at all,” I scratched at my beard, a tick of mine.

“Well to put it shortly man, there is nothing here, I even looked in some spots that you told me about on the Peterson's case,” He bent over to fix his shoe and motioned to the rest of the apartment, “I’ll catch up, go see for yourself.”

I thanked him and walked to the living area. Eyeing some photographs on the wall, none of them had Julia in them. Pictures of countries she had visited, some of the fields here in Virginia. No photo in the living room was of the same place more than once. In the corner of the living room was a large camera pointed at the door. She was a photographer, a skill she would have to relearn after losing a hand. 

I walked over to examine the camera. Turning it on it spurred and clicked as it came to life. I opened up the most recent images. One was of the street outside her window during the day, specifically of the tree line near the complex, the treeline that leads into Fox woods. The second was the same spot but it was at night, in the photo only a single street lamp lit up the sidewalk. I leaned in, squinting my eyes. Just outside of the light against the treeline, was the faint silhouette of a person, a very tall person. It was too dark to make out any features but it was a start.

“Bag this for evidence,” I said as I gave it to one of the analysts. 

There were tons of them on the scene, being the first real action we had had in a long time, everyone wanted a piece. I turned away from the living room and walked to the bedroom. 

Entering the bedroom it was in complete disarray. Almost as if she had a fight with someone. The sad truth was that Julia had searched her whole room looking for her hand. The dresser was pulled from the wall and the windows were opened letting in the cold air from outside. The closet was an overflowing mess of clothes that leaked onto the floor of the carpeted space. This poor woman had gone manic searching for a lost limb. 

“Hey, are you all securing all the food and drinks in the fridge? I wanna know if something was slipped in her food without her knowing,” I yelled back into the living room as some other officers passed by. 

Julia had agreed to a drug test and was clean, still, maybe traces of something could be found in the food, I hoped at least. One of the officers gave me a thumbs up as James walked in behind me.  

“What a nightmare huh?” He asked but didn’t wait for my reply, “Could you imagine this shit, was her hand all mangled or?”

He was prying for details, something James did a lot. His lack of real police work really made him excited to hear all the gory little details. 

“No, it was smooth, as if it just vanished from existence,” I said dryly, walking over to examine the pillows of the bed. 

I carefully flipped them over and ran my hands down them and examined my gloves. They were bone dry, nothing that could be absorbed through the skin. I examined the head board next, she had mentioned that the second her head hit the pillow is when she was dizzy. I felt my hands around the front for anything but found nothing. Turning my head I looked at her night stand. On the night stand was a single photo that contained the only photo of Julia I had seen so far.

The photo was of her and a man I had not seen before. Her hands wrapped around a man's shoulders with their heads back laughing. The only thing I found odd was that her left hand was obscured in the photo. As I reached for it I noticed a slight scratch in the wall behind the headboard. I pulled at the bed frame and the small twin moved with ease. The bed had been moved at some point. 

Examining the wall with my flashlight James knelt beside me.

“Weird, it’s like it was dragged in place here,” James said as he turned on his flashlight as well. 

“Yes, a bit odd considering that the carpet suggests it's been in the same spot for a long time,” I said pointing to the marks in the carpet. 

I moved the bed a little more and leaned around the side of the head board. 

“James, go get a forensic analyst, now,” I said as I turned back to him.	

“What is it?” He asked excitedly. 

“It’s a symbol of some kind, made from what appears to be blood.” 

On the back of the headboard was a large symbol, it swooped like a “J” with the tail spinning into a circle on itself. Surrounding it was a language I had seen before, Tagalog. Only one word stood out to me.   
  


“ASWANG”.

I've been here for a month a half. Just this past Friday (our bi-weekly pay day), I got my performance bonus for last month so I said to my team, ""Hey guys, coffee on break? My treat."" (There's 8 people in the team, including myself.) We went to the local coffee shop, they made their orders, I paid for it. Done. Everyone's happy-happy.

Come lunch, my boss excused me and invited me to her office. She said someone from the team complained about my usage of ""Hey guys"". I wasn't even thinking of it as a gender thing, but more of a collective term. I don't know who reported me to HR, but I got coached about microaggressions and was asked to apologize to the team, which I did. I said something along the lines of, ""I apologize if I offended anybody earlier. It wasn't my intention to cause harm.""

Just when I thought it's over, I checked my work email when I got home and apparently I am scheduled to take an instructor-led diversity, inclusion & belonging training (4 hours) and company policy refresher training (1 hour) on Monday. I feel like things just escalated so easily for something I wasn't even malicious about.

This makes me feel like I can't trust anyone in the group, and I feel like I'm being targeted for being new. Perhaps they think my offer to treat people was my way of being a suckup. Has anyone experienced this? I don't have any conflict with anyone in the office. I get along with them (or so I thought).

I'm thinking of waiting for my next pay day (end of month) and turning in my two-week notice. At least that'll give me at least one month of pay to prepare to look for something else.

Am I the buttface for wanting to leave? I ask this because when I got hired, they were so thankful because they've been looking for an in-house IT guy for a long time but couldn't (the pay is very very entry-level but I took it because I need a job and I'm a new graduate), so they were relying on an on-call contractor.

1msbqif,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/1msbqif/has_anyone_had_these_symptoms_alongside_uc/,Has Anyone Had These Symptoms Alongside UC?,"Hi everyone,

I was diagnosed with mild to moderate ulcerative proctitis back in June (symptoms started in January). Since then, I’ve been dealing with some weird symptoms that don’t seem super common with UC, and honestly they’ve been harder to manage than the UC itself. Curious if anyone else has gone through something like this.

Here’s what’s been going on:
	•	Food allergies/intolerances: Over the past couple years I’ve suddenly developed allergies to tons of fruits and veggies. In June I ate a banana (which I’ve always been fine with), and the next thing I knew I had hives all over my body for a couple of weeks. Ever since then, the other symptoms below kicked in and haven’t stopped.
	•	Blurry vision (left eye): Showed up suddenly in June. Some days it’s better than others, but it’s always there. My eye doctor just said my vision dropped a little (20/25 now), but didn’t give me much else.
	•	Eczema/psoriasis flares: This one is the worst. Anytime I eat carbs—or honestly, anything other than meat—I break out in itchy bumps that turn into red patches, then dry, peeling skin. It only shows up on either side of my nose (weirdly not on my nose itself) and lasts for days. Right now my diet is down to like five foods (all meats + decaf coffee). Even something small, like adding half-and-half to my coffee, triggers it. I’ve dropped 10 lbs in the past month and just feel exhausted.

Where I’m at now:
	•	On mesalamine pills + enemas, but they aren’t helping the proctitis.
	•	Starting steroids soon.
	•	Already saw an eye doctor and my GI, and I’ve got a rheumatology appointment next week.

Has anyone else had symptoms like this with their UC? Would love to hear if you’ve found anything that helped.",1,1755387835.0,UlcerativeColitis,0,1.0,False

1msbow3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1msbow3/i_cant_stop_checking_my_exs_social_media/,I can’t stop checking my ex’s social media,"I know it’s probably the worst thing to do when you’re trying to move on from a breakup, but I just can’t stop checking my ex’s social media.

For some context: we met up for coffee a little while ago, and ever since then I’ve been noticing “signs” in her stories and posts (like songs and references that used to mean something between us). Maybe she’s doing it consciously, maybe unconsciously… but deep down I know it’s not anything concrete.

She’s an influencer and very active online, even more so since we broke up. A part of me feels strangely reassured by having this sort of “connection” to her life, even though I know it’s honestly the worst thing for me right now.

It’s been almost a year since we broke up, and I truly want to move forward. I’m fully aware that checking her social media isn’t helping me, but I can’t seem to cut it off completely.

Has anyone else been through this? How did you manage to stop and actually move on?

Please be kind — I know it sounds easy in theory, but in reality it feels almost like trying to quit an addiction",5,1755387722.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Wolfe Ranch
When the night was calling for sleep, I had the kids get ready for bed.
“Mama, they're both wolves,” Ivy said.
I wondered what she was talking about and suddenly it hit me. She was talking about Owen and Preston. My new employees.
“Then what are they doing here?” I asked.
“We don’t know,” Jacob spoke up with, “One is a Beta like dad and the other is an Alpha.”
What would an Alpha and a Beta be doing in a human single mom's ranch, acting like they wanted to work here? What did I just get us into?

Chapter 1
Cat
It’s our typical Monday morning on Wolfe Ranch twenty miles outside of Baker, Montana. Baker is a small town of about two thousand people but is widely known in the world. This sleepy little town had more going for it than just the cattle industry. There were other things around here to enjoy.
There are three packs of werewolves that surround my property of three hundred acres. There’s one pack to the east, one to the west and one just north of us, leaving the south open to who knows what.
I could only guess that the total number of pack members for these packs would be about one thousand or more people that aren’t on our annual census. We never had problems with the packs and had dealings with one of them all my life. With all of this going on around me, how could I be negligent and not notice the strange things like the packs after living out here my whole life?
By the way, my name is Cathrine but everyone just calls me Cat. I’m a twenty-five-year-old single mom to my adorable twins who just turned six. Ivy and Jacob are my whole world other than the ranch I inherited when my dad passed away two years ago from a heart attack.
My dad raised me by himself after my mom died when I was nine. She was out riding in one of the pastures when she had a brain aneurysm and fell from her horse. When she didn’t come back home by dark, dad went looking for her.
Daddy was a great man, strong yet gentle and always supportive. He was always there when I needed him. He didn’t pass judgment when I got pregnant with the twins, decided not to go to college and cut ties with their father. Well, cut ties as much as I could.
I was up this morning before the sun as always to make breakfast for everyone, including my one ranch hand, Hank, who was my dad's best friend. He’s an old cranky man that has my back no matter what. He would tell it like it is and I always needed that. He saw the world differently than me and it was important to have that around.
I made my coffee and was sipping on it while starting the stove to get eggs, bacon and toast made for everyone. As I cracked the eggs to whisk them up, I heard both the kids' alarms go off from their rooms upstairs. One of the kids turned their alarm off quickly and I could hear the sound of footsteps running across the floor. I know that it’s Ivy because she’s always excited about going to school.
Jacob’s alarm was still going off in his room for a minute or two before I heard him turn it off. I listened as Ivy headed to the bathroom, while Jacob sounded like a drunk person stumbling up to his closet to get dressed. I stifled my laughter and shook my head at him.
Soon, I had the eggs ready in a large bowl and started to cook the bacon. Hank shuffled into the kitchen from the back door to get coffee and sit at the table. He lived in the foreman house not far away from the main house that I lived in with the kids.
Hank was in his fifties, almost sixties and he was slowing down. He wasn’t a tall man and had a belly that was growing as he aged and drank beer. His hair and mustache were gray and his light brown eyes were kind.
“Good morning, Cat,” Hank said as he grabbed a mug to fill with hot coffee.
“Good morning, Hank. How are you this morning?” I asked.
“As good as ever.”
This was his answer most mornings unless he’s really not doing good. He’s been working on the ranch all his life. Most of the time, he is stiff but he can work and move just like everyone else, it just takes a little longer for his body to get ready for each day.
As the bacon cooked and Hank sipped his coffee, Ivy bounded down the stairs into the kitchen. Ivy was one of the sweetest kids I have ever met. She’s smart, caring and strong-willed. With her bright blue eyes and black hair, she will grow up to be a beautiful woman.
“Well, good morning, little stinker,” Hank said as Ivy took her seat at the table.
“Good morning, Hank,” she said, rolling her eyes. Then she looked at me and smiled, saying, “good morning, mama.”
“Good morning, baby. How did you sleep?”
“Perfect!” she answered happily.
I finished cooking breakfast at the stove about the time Jacob walked down the stairs. Jacob looks like his sister with blue eyes and black hair. His personality is the complete opposite of Ivy’s though. Jacob is very protective, guarded and tends to get angry very easily. He can be sweet but you really have to know him to know what sweet is.
He had a seat with Hank and Ivy while I brought the food to the table. When everything was placed down, I sat down and we started to fill our plates with food.
While eating, I told Hank, ""I'm going to head to the feed store and the general store this morning after dropping them off at school.""
""Ok. You got the list of supplies ready?"" he asked to make sure.
""Yep. Any extra requests?” I asked.
“Can you get that chocolate spread we use so much of?”
“I have Nutella down on my list. Don’t worry,” I told him with a smile.
He nodded his head and took another bite of breakfast.
“I'll also be on the lookout for two more hands,” I told everyone.
""Don't hold your breath on finding anyone,"" Hank grumbled.
""Oh, I won't, but I need to get the word out there that we need some extra help.""
Hank just nodded his head and kept eating his food. Sure, the two of us could manage this place but it was tough for us. I really needed at least two more people to help out.
I had crops to plant in the garden, cattle to bring in, daily chores and then kids with homework at the end of each day. If there were four of me, life would be exquisite.
We finished our breakfast then cleaned our dishes. The kids went to grab their backpacks while I drank the last of my coffee. The three of us pulled on light jackets and headed out the door to my truck while Hank was headed to the stables to get his horse ready for his day.
The kids and I got into my dark green dodge pickup truck and started it up. The weather had just turned warmer and we were soaking it up. The mornings would start off in the forties and by the warmest part of the day, it was in the sixties. I was happy that there was no snow on the ground and spring was in full swing.
I started our journey into Baker, where I would drop the kids off for their day at school and I could get errands done. Cross your fingers that I can find two ranch hands looking for work. Fate needs to be a little nice to me at some point. Let this be that day.
I drove into town and up to the school to sit in the crazy line with all the other parents. For such a small town the school line was always insane, but I guess that’s what happens when all the grades are in one place. When it was our turn for the kids to get out of the vehicle, their teacher opened the truck door and both of the kids barreled out of my truck at her. I barely got to tell them bye as they raced into the building.
“Well, I guess have a good day,” I said to myself as the line started to move and I left the school.
Once I was away from the school I made my way further into town. I had a few errands to run in town before heading back to the ranch. My first order of business was to go to the feed store. We seemed to always be needing feed or hay. I needed to put in a hay order with the guy that I always got hay from near Billings. Life was never slow for a ranch owner, but I couldn’t let it overwhelm me.
I parked my truck on Main Street and hopped out. Walking into the feed store I smelled all the familiar smells of leather and feed. There’s just something about the smell of a feed store that puts a smile on my face and sets my soul at peace.
“Hello, Cat. What can we do for you today?” the clerk asked when he saw me.
“Hey, John. Well, I need the usual. Five bags of cattle feed, two bags of horse feed and two bags of chicken feed,” I said as I stepped up to the counter.
John is a middle-aged bald man with a large salt and pepper mustache. Sweet man and always helpful. Knows a lot about livestock, so whenever I’m lost and need answers, he’s always someone I call other than the vet.
I paid my bill and got the receipt to hand it to the workers in the warehouse. I make my way around the side and find Oscar sitting on some feed stacks waiting for something to do.
I greeted him with a big smile and said, “Hey, Oscar. Boring morning?”
“Hey, Cat. Yeah, it’s a little slow so far this morning,” he answered as I handed him my feed receipt.
“Well, here’s a little something for you to do,” I said.
He got up and grabbed a feed cart. He looked over the ticket and quickly started piling up my order on it. Once he had everything, we headed out front to my truck to load it up. I brought the tailgate of my truck down and climbed up into the bed. Oscar started handing me the feed sacks so I could place them where I needed them while we talked.
“Do you know of anyone in the area that’s looking for a ranch hand job? It’s gotten to the point where Hank and I need help out at the ranch,” I told him.
“Not that I know of off the top of my head. I’ll talk to a few people and see what I can find out,” he answered.
“Sounds good.”
“If I were you, I would go to the general store and ask Amy too,” Oscar suggests.
“I was actually thinking about that. I need to get a few things there anyway.”
Once we were done loading the feed sacks, I climbed out of my truck and closed the tailgate.
“See ya later Cat and good luck on the hiring process,” Oscar said as he waved and walked away with the cart.
“Thanks,” I told him.
I hope my search gets better results. I mean I’m not desperate for help yet but I knew I would get there eventually and I needed to find people before that happened.
I turned from the feed store and walked across the street to the general store. It’s an old wooden building that looks like it came right out of a western. We love it though and Amy, the owner, makes repairs and updates to it each year but intentionally keeps the old western feel to it.
I walked into the general store and as always, as I opened the door, I heard the bell ding from above me. I stepped inside and closed the door behind me. I glanced around and found that I’m the only one in the store other than Amy. She was at the counter opening things up for her day.
“Good morning, Cat,” she told me when she glanced up and saw me.
“Good morning, Amy.”
I quickly went down the three aisles that the store has, grabbing the few things that we needed and that the kids asked for. The general store didn’t carry much, but if you needed something, Amy could order it and have it delivered to the store.
When I had all of my items, I walked up to the counter and set them down while smiling at Amy. She smiled back at me and started ringing up my items while making the usual small talk. She was a sweet woman who was a few years older than me. Amy was a little taller than me with a thin build and long brunette hair. She was really pretty.
“So how are things going on the ranch?” she asked me.
“Good. I’m actually looking for two ranch hands to help out. Do you know of anyone looking for work at the moment?”
She finished ringing me up and told me the total while thinking about my question. I handed her the cash and she opened the drawer to get my change. She reached out and handed me my change and receipt.
“Actually, I don’t know of anyone at the moment, which is odd for this time of year. Someone is always looking for work around here,” she told me with a perplexed look.
I nodded my head and put the change in my jeans pocket. I knew there would be a chance that there wouldn’t be anyone looking for work and that’s ok. I would keep looking because the work would still be there to get done.
“That’s ok. Keep me in mind if anyone comes asking around,” I said as I grabbed my bags from the countertop.
“Will do. Have a great day,” Amy said.
“I will and you too,” I told her with a bright smile.
I turned to walk towards the door with my bags of goods when it opened up and two men stepped inside. Onsight of them, I instantly stopped in my tracks and looked them both over. Both were handsome in their blue jeans, baseball caps and tight t-shirts. I could see hard muscular bodies through the clothing and I won't lie it was a turn on.
I was drawn to one of them instantly and wondered why I was so attracted to this man right away. That was unusual. I had only ever been with or attracted to the twin's dad. Though now, I wasn’t attracted to him anymore. Most days I hated him.
""Good morning, guys. What can I do for you today?"" Amy asked.
Both of them stood in front of the door, blocking me in and looking at me. What was going on here?
""Actually, we were hoping to help Miss…?"" one of them said while looking at me.
""Wolfe,"" I answered.
""That's right. We were hoping to help Miss Wolfe fill those ranch hand positions,"" he said.
I took a good look at the men in front of me and realized that I had seen them before but it was years ago. They went to the same high school as me but they were a few years older.
""How?"" I asked.
""We were over at the feed store and were told to come find you over here. We’re looking for some work,"" the same guy said.
I nodded my head while looking them over. I could tell by how they held themselves and walked that they didn't know much about ranch work or life. I was desperate at the moment. I could teach them just about anything if they were willing to learn.
""Alright, perfect. The ranch is just down Highway 20. You'll see the entrance that says Wolfe Ranch on the right-hand side.""
""Alright, we will come by shortly,"" he told me.
The other one just nodded at me while staring intently. They opened the door and I walked past them and to my truck. Was I crazy for bringing them on as ranch hands? I would have to teach them everything, but it was better than nothing at all.
Chapter 2
Owen
My Beta, Preston, and I had gone to the feed store this morning in search of Cat Wolfe, the woman that owned the three hundred acre property below ours. All ranches needed feed so if I was lucky we would catch her here in town this morning.
Several of my patrol guards had come up dead in recent weeks and I needed to know if it was her killing my pack members. I had already contacted the other two packs in the area to make sure it wasn’t one of them trying to start a fight. The other two packs said that they had members that were either dead or missing, so the last person to talk to was this human that lived right in the middle of all of our territories.
The guy at the feed store, Oscar, told us to find her at the general store and that we had just missed her. I was pleased that we were in town at the same time as her. Oscar also informed us that she was looking for ranch hands. I didn’t care that she was looking for workers. I needed to know if she was responsible for killing my people. How I was going to get that information out of a human, I don’t know, but I needed to talk to her.
We walked across the street and up to the general store then went inside. There I was met by the most enchanting woman that I had ever laid eyes on. She had me stopping dead in my tracks and shutting my mouth as I went to say something. My brain fogged over as I just stood there staring at her.
She had long wavy blond hair and captivating light green eyes. I stood there silently as Preston talked and I took a deep breath, unable to form words while looking at her. My heart was racing in my chest and I could feel the blood flowing through my body and straight to my cock.
I finally blinked and took another deep breath to calm down. I had never reacted this way to anyone so I knew what it could possibly mean. As I took a breath, I got her scent in my nose, sweet like a field of Lupine flowers. There was something else mixed into it though. There was something else on her. The different scents of two wolf pups. That’s odd. What is this human rancher doing with wolf pups?
""She’s our mate,"" Jet, my wolf, said in my head.
He didn't even need to tell me that. Something inside me already knew that she was mine. But this is all wrong. Why was fate being cruel?
""How can she be our mate? For one thing, she's human and for another, she’s the enemy. We have dead pack members that I have reason to believe she killed.""
""But you're drawn to her just like I am.""
""Crap, how am I going to do this?""
I let Jet fall to the back of my mind when I heard Preston offer her our help on her ranch. What the hell was he thinking? Though it might be our best way of getting answers without scaring her to death.
I didn’t say anything as we stepped to the side and let Cat leave the store. I watched her retreat, still standing there in silence. I watched how her hips moved when she walked and admired her nice round ass in her tight blue jeans. She was gorgeous.
I watched her still as she got into her truck and drove out of town. Once she was gone, I looked at Preston and he smiled and shrugged his shoulders at me. I shook my head in irritation and turned to leave the store with Preston right behind me. We walked down the street to my truck and jumped in. I didn’t start my truck up but looked at him in irritation.
“We don’t know shit about ranching. What the hell are you thinking?” I yelled at Preston.
“We know how to ride horses,” he offered with a smile.
“We don’t know much else,” I said in irritation.
“This is the best opportunity to learn if she’s the one killing our members,” he said.
I closed my eyes and leaned my head against the seat. I sighed before speaking, knowing I would need to tell him my thoughts and about the new situation I was now facing.
“I know that and I agree, but we don’t know how to really help her out on a ranch. Besides, now I don’t want her to be the damn killer.”
“The pretty face got you, didn’t it?” he asked with a huge smile on his face.
I let a growl out at him and said, “She’s my mate.”
“Oh, fuck!” he said in astonishment.
“Yeah.”
“Well, then we really do need to find out if she’s the killer now, don’t we?”
“Seems so. Though, I don’t want to and yet I do. I want to reject her and yet I don’t.”
“So conflicted,” he teased.
I growled at him and he laughed at me. What an asshole.
“Let’s go do our investigation and see where it lands us. I also want to know why she smelled like wolf pups,” I added.
“I smelled it too. It is odd,” he said while thinking about it and looking out the windshield of my truck.
I pulled my phone out of my pocket and called my Gamma, my third in command. Easton was back at the pack taking care of everything in mine and Preston’s absence. I informed him of everything that was going on and he laughed before telling me good luck. I wanted to go back home just to beat his ass, but that would be pointless and would use up valuable time we needed to use on investigating Cat.
~
Cat
I arrived back home and drove up to the barn to unload the feed. I parked and left my truck running as I started putting the feed in the barn where it went. As I unloaded the feed I had to step around the barn cat, Blinks, as he was always under my feet every time I was in here. He lived out here in the barn and made sure the mice and rats left the feed alone. I loved this cat even if he was a pain.
“Sir, you need to move before I step on you,” I told him.
He sat in the middle of the walkway and meowed at me. Probably telling me to go to hell, that he wasn’t in the way. I knew he wanted attention but I had work to get done first.
When I had all the feed unloaded, I drove back up to the house and parked where I always do. I took the groceries inside and put them away before getting my day of chores started. Just as I was getting ready to walk to the back of the barn where the chicken coop was, a truck I didn’t know came driving up to the house. I stopped and turned to see who it was and noticed it was the guys from the grocery store.
I stood there close to the front of the house and waited for them to get out and walk up to me. While waiting, I ran their faces through my head and realized what their names were. One was Owen West and the other was Preston Anderson. I was a freshman in high school while they were seniors. I’m sure they really had no idea who I was other than their new boss.
I stood there and watched as they both got out of the truck and walked up to me. Owen had been driving, so I assumed the brand new Chevy pickup was his. It looked nice. So why did they need work as ranch hands, which didn’t pay much of anything, if he had a brand new truck?
“I realized that we didn’t introduce ourselves earlier,” Owen said in his deep raspy voice.
His voice made a delightful shiver run over my body and I couldn’t understand why I reacted like that to him. I brushed it off quickly and started talking with him.
“I know who both of you are, Owen,” I told him.
He seemed surprised by that and nodded his head. Preston stood there grinning widely and I wondered why he was so happy.
“Why are you two looking for work?” I asked.
“We just wanted some ranch experience,” Preston spoke up.
I nodded my head and said, “come on, I have a lot to teach the both of you then.”
I turned and started walking to the chicken coop with both of them quickly walking after me. I showed them everything I possibly could when it came to the chickens, the barn, the goat pen and then the stables. All of it was conveniently located in one spot. The cattle were out in one of the large pastures for spring grazing, so there was no showing them off right now.
The dogs, Leah and Dozer, came running up to greet them. They completely ignored me and paid attention to the two men that they didn’t know, getting attention and pets while acting excited about seeing them.
“So what all will you need done?” Owen asked, peeling his attention off Dozer.
“I need basic chores done each day along with repairs and simple building projects. Hank and I will need help with cattle and horses each day also. Fences have to be checked every day for holes or stuck animals,” I told them.
“Who’s Hank?” Owen asked in a tone I wasn’t sure I was able to recognize.
“My only other ranch hand. He was my dad's best friend and he’s getting slower in his old age. Don’t you dare tell him I said that,” I told them with raised eyebrows.
“How long have the two of you been doing all of this on your own?” Preston asked.
“Two years,” I answered.
They both nodded before Owen asked, “what do you need us to do first, Miss Wolfe?”
“Call me Cat and I need the two of you to muck out the stalls. Do either of you know how to do that?” I asked.
“Yes. We know how to work with horses and how to ride,” Owen told me.
I nodded my head and told them, “go ahead and get to it then. Meet me at the main house for lunch.”
They turned towards the stables and I went about going to the main house to my office to get paperwork done and pay bills. The joys of owning a ranch; bills, bookkeeping, scheduling the Ferrier for the horses, getting the vet out for all the animals and ordering supplies along with hay.
When lunchtime came around, I went to the kitchen and started getting stuff out for lunch. Lunch was always simple; we would either eat leftovers or make sandwiches. Today was sandwiches, so I was slicing bread and vegetables. I heard the back door open and in came Hank. I handed him his sandwich and he sat down at the table.
“Thank you, Cat,” he told me before he started eating.
“You’re welcome.”
A few seconds went by and the door opened once more. Owen and Preston stepped inside and took their hats off before greeting Hank. I laughed at Hank’s expression. I knew he would be shocked to see that I had found help.
When everyone settled down, Hank went back to his food and I handed Preston and Owen both a plate with a sandwich and chips on it.
“Thank you,” they said at the same time.
“You’re both welcome,” I said with a smile.
They sat down and started eating while I got my food put together. When I was done, I had a seat at the table and started eating. I realized that I would have to get the extra chairs out and put the leaf in the table in order for all of us to fit at the next meal since the kids would be home.
“So what are you doing while these two are doing all of your chores?” Hank asked playfully.
“Oh, you know fun stuff. Like paying bills and calling to order hay,” I said sarcastically.
“Seems like an easy job. Can you help me with fences when you’re done?” He asked.
“I actually can. I just need to be back here at the house by five to meet the kids at the bus stop.”
“Kids?” Owen asked in a shocked voice.
I looked over at him and saw a sour expression on his face. I wondered why that bothered him so much. He was acting oddly and I didn’t know what to think of it.
“Yeah. I have twins,” I told him.
“You’re raising them on your own?” he asked with frowning eyebrows.
“Yes.”
“Where’s their dad? If you don’t mind me asking,” he said, not trying to offend me.
“It’s ok. I just don’t want to be with that asshole anymore. Besides, we're better off without him,” I answered dryly.
He said nothing more but nodded his head. He didn’t finish eating his meal and I could tell that he honestly looked sick to his stomach and upset suddenly.
“Are you ok?” I asked him as I got up and dealt with the dishes.
“Yeah I’ll be fine,” Owen told me as he gave me a weak smile and turned to leave the house to go back to the stables with Preston right behind him.
Once I was done with the dishes, I followed Hank out of the house. He got on his horse that was tied to one of the porch pillars and headed out towards the East pasture to check fences. I walked into the stable and saw Owen and Preston cleaning the last of the stalls out. I walked over and opened up my gelding’s stall, Thunder. He had been my horse for the past ten years. He was good to me and knew how to read my moods and I knew how to read his. We were a team out on the ranch and worked long hard hours together. We were a part of each other at this point.
I took him out to the saddling area and started getting his tack on him. He stood there patiently as I got him ready to go. I looked over to see how well the guys were doing and knew I needed to give them a task to do after that.
“When you are done, go ahead and get to know the two horses you will be riding while you’re here. Bolt and Annie. Bolt actually doesn’t bolt away, it’s because of the marking on his forehead.”
“Ok,” Preston said with a smile.
Once I had Thunder ready to go, I walked him out of the stable and climbed on his back. I turned him towards the northeast corner of the property and dug my heels into him, sending him forward at a steady gallop. We were headed to check fences along the east, along the highway. I would end up at the front gate where the bus dropped the kids off, right as they arrived home for the day.
Chapter 3
Owen
My mate already had kids without me. The knowledge of that was like a knife to my gut, having it twisted while inside me and a huge blow to my heart. Jet was in my head whining and howling loudly. I knew that I would need to let him out tonight so he could run this off. He was hurt and I could feel it deep in my bones.
We went to the stables to finish working after lunch. Cat came in and got her horse not long after that. I kept my head down and kept working, trying my best to ignore her. I heard her tell us which horses we would be using while we were here but I said nothing.
Once she left the stables and rode off, I left the stall I had been working on and leaned against the wall to think and process everything. Preston finished with his stall and leaned against the wall on the other side of the walkway.
“Are you ok?” he asked after a while.
“Honestly, no. I’m not. I know that with her being a human there's no way for her to know that I’m her mate and that having children is something that should have been for the two of us. This whole situation is fucked.”
He nodded his head then said, “it is, but we need to find out what’s going on. We will figure all of this out. Don’t worry. ”
I nodded my head and took a deep breath to calm down. I pushed off the wall and got back to work trying to put the thoughts out of my head, but I was stuck with them for now. We worked on the last of the stalls and I looked around realizing that there were a lot of horses in here. At least ten and each of them had their own space with their own nameplate.
When we were done cleaning the stalls, we took time to mess with Annie and Bolt. Bolt seemed to like me more than Preston, but Annie was sweet to us both. We stayed in the stalls and gave the horses attention until Hank came in. He tied his horse up and started taking the gear off it while looking around the stalls.
“The two of you did a good job in here,” he told us.
“Thank you,” Preston said.
He nodded his head and told us, “when you two are done bonding with your horses, get the goats in the barn for the night.”
“How do we do that?” Preston asked.
“The best way to get them in is with feed in a bucket. Lead them in and then you can dump the bucket in the feed trough when they are all where they need to be.”
“Sounds easy,” Preston said, and Hank laughed at him.
“It can be. Oh, you will need to gather eggs and close up the chicken coop. We don’t need coyotes eating more chickens,” he told us.
I kept petting Bolt while watching Hank finish with his horse, then put her up. He left the stables afterward without saying anything else. Preston and I left the horses and went to the barn. He got a bucket of feed to get the goats in the barn with. There was a large pen in the back of the barn to close them in with hay, water and a feeding trough. Preston led them inside while I walked behind them and closed them in.
“With two people that is pretty easy,” Preston said.
“Yeah,” I agreed, though I didn’t really care.
After that, the two of us went to the chicken coop with a basket and gathered eggs while the chickens were getting ready to settle in for the night. One hen thought that my hand was something to peck at and I got pecked the crap out a few times. Chickens are mean!
Once we had all the eggs, we left the coop and closed the chickens in. We left the barn area with the egg basket and walked toward the main house. As we were walking, I heard a horse's hooves beating the ground as it trotted towards us. I looked up to find Cat on her horse with both of her kids riding with her. Scratch that, not kids, pups. Her twins are wolf pups. What wolf would dare get a human pregnant that wasn’t his mate?
Without thinking, as I exhaled, I let out a low growl of irritation. Preston hit my arm, drawing my attention to him. I tore my eyes from her and her pups and looked over to Preston. He was shaking his head while frowning at me. I took a deep breath to calm down and walked with him to the house. We stepped inside and found Hank getting something to drink then walking out to the porch to sit down.
I set the basket of eggs down on the counter and placed my hands against the edges while looking at the ground. I took another deep breath. I could feel Jet now hurt and angry clawing to get out. I had to try my best to fight him back. I felt Preston’s hand on my shoulder to give me some strength and comfort. This was a fucking nightmare. I had no idea what to think here. I had so many questions and wanted answers now.
I got myself together and stood upright. We both got a drink from the refrigerator and went to join Hank on the porch. We sat down and enjoyed the night air and the peace and quiet. It was quiet here compared to the pack",1,1755387721.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

I am a natural level 6/7 with highlighted hair level 9/10.  The color is a bit too light and cool toned for me, especially around my face.  I would like to achieve a color like in these photos using Redken Shades EQ gloss.

Would 7CB and 8N be a good formula for this color, or do you have any other ideas for a formula?  Thanks for your help!

She had a friends with benefits sitationship with him, before we met some months later. When i asked her about it, she told me it's a friend of hers and ""oh haven't i told you that i'm going to get coffee with him?"" Mind you she tells me all about her real friends so it seems unusual that she would forget. When i pointed out that he's not a friend but her fuckbuddy she said ""well but it wasn't just sex, we also did some activities (hiking) together without getting physical. To the question why it was in her archived chats, she told me that's how she handles her messages that are ticked off like a task (last text was only a day ago, she texted him back with a positive answer to coffee before meeting me only an hour later, yikes). 

I somehow believed all her explanations because i just can't imagine her lying straight to my face like that. She emphasized strongly that she would never do anything with him besides coffee. She showed me a text to him where she told him she had a bf. He did not even acknowledge it but asked about meeting up. Now i started noticing subtle behaviour changes regarding her phone, always turning it upside down or hiding it in her sports bag when she goes for a shower.

Am i just stupid? I thought she was the most genuine and trustable person, the sweetest and that she couldn't do this. On the other hand, when i add all those points up, it seems clear as day and my gut is wrenching.",2,1755387663.0,AmIOverreacting,7,0.63,False

He is dying and hes mind is failing him and he addresses you as son or daughter. As an apology for being a terrible father, he'd let you pick one of hes most prized possessions. Your options are.

A) Tell him the truth or refuse. It would anger him, he might either teleport you back with nothing or turn you into a chicken, give you a pigtail etc. Still, it's an option.

B) The Kung Fu pants. They will adjust to the rest of your clothing and fit more or less the style but will always cover your full legs(can't turn into a bikini). They are always awake and alert, ready to protect you and will move your legs on their own they have lightning fast reflexes, are able to leap across the room to take out a shooter or fight off a gang of thugs. You can also use them offensively by picking a fight yourself. They will still help you and keep you safe. None of the actions the pants take will hurt you in any way. However they can't protect your arms, head or upper body and you always remain in full control of them. If you take them off, they are completely useless until you put them back on. They self clean.

C) Absorb a portion of the sorcerers power. You will start developing magic but also become increasingly eccentric. You will start wearing weird hats, pointed shoes and bathrobes with moons and stars on them. You sometimes speak in rhyme or riddles and will eat your watermelons with mustard or put ketchup in your coffee. You will remain completely sane though. Just think doing this is normal and other people are weird. You can also try to mimic other people even if you think it's stupid but will look creepy like an alien pretending to be a human then.. closely observing others, not understanding why they do it and mimicking them etc.

The magic powers you will get with this don't let you reverse and would be limited to ""impressive but not godlike"". So can't bring back the dead, time travel, become immortal etc. No cheats or hacks. The downside is also that the powers increase over time and you will still age normally. (It's not the same as the other things combined)

D) An old milk carton filled with ""improved"" crab juice. Drinking it all would cure anyone of any illness or injury except for aging or death. It will auto fill once per day. Pouring it out will make it go rancid and useless in a day so you can't store it. It tastes as it sounds though.

E) The Endless Wallet. It's filled with paper money.. and it's Russian Rubles. They're cheap as hell and you can only take out one bill at a time(lets say around $1/s if you get good at it). It never runs out though.

F) The clown shoes of dominance. Put them on, put your hands on your hip and stare at someone. Tap 3 times. They will follow a single command you give them, then become immune for a month. They think whatever you tell them to do was their idea after. Taking the shoes off will automatically release them from any compulsion and it can't last over 24h regardless.",1,1755387580.0,WouldYouRather,2,1.0,False

When you need water you can always go over to the sink.

You don't understand why water is so important to people in the desert. You've always got water at the sink.

Some days you go out for water and it's too expensive, or the store is closed, or the cashier doesn't want to sell it to you, sometimes the water just like the sink is not good.

Deny 2. Yell at me for ""blaming it on him"" which I am not but I have a right to recognize how everyone treated me growing up and how that seriously affected me. 3. Probs kick me out and I would have nowhere to go lol. 

I'm not that upset because lamotrigine (yay) but it's still just ironic that youuu (dad) can talk about whatever pisses you off and put me in the middle of your problems, but whenever I try to talk about my childhood you don't want to hear it. 

Guys this man literally told me that he thought his wife/my step-mom going to jail a year ago is what caused my bpd... I just looked at him deadpan and said ""no that's not it"" when I really just wanted to laugh and say no man, this is traumatic and definitely triggered my symptoms to become more noticeable and problematic to my relationships with my family, but what caused this shit is you, my step-mom, her kid, and my sister all being super assholes to me growing up and invalidating my mental health at every right and left turn. They've all changed and grown as people but ever since getting my bpd diagnosis and understanding it, I really thought long and hard about what affected me and how this progressed in me. I really starting showing signs of emotional dysregulation when I was 12-13. I was shown by everyone that talking about or expressing my emotions was unsafe and would lead to corporal punishment that was also very traumatic for me, so I turned inwards and began cutting my legs so nobody would see it. My dad only found out once (I continued but lied about it) he was only concerned about how I made him look bad, he didn't care at all about my well-being. 

Thinking so much about my past has made me feel extremely resentful towards them and I wish they knew how terrible they used to be. I became best friends with my sister and she knows me better than anybody else, but oh man in the last few months I have been fighting with her a lot, but I think it's because she acts like she's supposed to be my mother and that's something that always made me angry growing up because get the f off my back, you're only a year older than me, not enough to be asking me where I'm going/what I'm doing all the time. I'm 26 now so everytime someone asks me this I want to say ""none of your business"" 😭

I worked so hard to get away from home at 18. I went to college and got my BA. I knew graduate school was my ticket out of state, so I enrolled and moved to Texas. I LOVED being independent and on my own, I felt free. My bpd symptoms began progressing at this point in a way I didn't realize before, such as being extremely promiscuous as a form of validation that I am pretty because I am deeply insecure, being emotionally volatile if I felt like somebody was ""leaving me"" and I even cut myself again at 22 years old when I had not in 3 years. Everything turned into a downward spiral in 2022 when I started working hard for a toxic job that was a new company and I got caught up in the stupid ass message and quit that job in late 2024 because they treated me so terribly and gave me so much anxiety. 

Even after this, I was so desperate to work hard and keep my independence. I started working two jobs, I worked 60-70 hours every week and my days off were never consecutive. I did this for 7-8 months and it was also taking a toll on my mental health. Around Christmas last year was ready bad because I miss my mom and it was my first Christmas without her. Another big downward spiral of events began in late March of this year. I got into a car wreck and my car was deemed a total loss. I STILL went to work right after I got in a wreck. The ONE time I could not go to work is because my new car that I had just gotten was towed from my apartment because of their janky rules that I was still following, and honestly I really went back and forth with them about it in early April when it happened because how can you tow me when x, y, z rules are clearly being broken with no towing enforced for others? One of my jobs fired me by the afternoon for calling out due to my car being towed. She wanted me to Uber 30 minutes to work and then back, which would increase my towing charge from waiting to retrieve my car, Uber back, then get my car. Like bitch no wtf are you talking about especially working at a coffee shop. 

I was devastated, I had never been fired in my life. I knew I was not in the wrong here, but the intensity of my anger was unusual. I told the manager that if she ever sees me, do not speak to me or I will cuss her tf out. Fast forward a week, my apartment puts a 3 day notice to vacate on my door for unpaid rent in FEBRUARY that I did pay, but I didn't notice it bounced in my bank account. Yes, this is my fault for not double checking my bank statements. They never said a word to me about this, even when going back and forth about towing my car. They made excuses that they used a messaging system that they didn't know I opted out of. Y'all I did not opt out of shit. I can't afford to wait for them to file eviction against me, so the next day, I packed up what I could fit in my car with me and my cat and had to move back in with my dad and sister in another state. I lost all my furniture and many personal items because I had to choose what was important enough to take and what had to stay.

I was so so ashamed and I still feel that shame but it's not so overwhelming. I got triggered SO badly coming back home in a way that I never thought would happen. Suddenly my symptoms were not so internalized anymore and I really started acting out. Saying ""no"" to me would send me into a spiral, or saying something that I perceived as snappy or ""getting on my ass"" when I just wanted to be in my room. I would sob and spiral because we don't have much food in the house, because I ran out of something, because I couldn't have something. This came out of me so differently and I felt like I was going crazy. I would go to my room, want to throw things, I would want to yell and scream. Then my dad would hear me and come in to yell at me and tell me that he doesn't deserve to live in a house where everyone has to tiptoe around me. Cue the crying. I was not just crying, I was openly sobbing and my sadness was so intense. I would sob until I was lying on the floor with tears and snot down my face. Cue my dad again, telling me that nothing I'm crying over is that serious and to stop it. He even threatened to kick me out over it and of course that made me lose it and I just stopped coming out of my room whenever anyone else was home.

Obviously my dad and sister did not deserve the way I was acting, and I felt like I was actually losing my mind because I didn't even recognize myself. I got my bpd diagnosis maybe a month and a half ago. I thought it was funny because I studied psychology and one of my special interests for a while was personality disorders because its what one of my professors specialized in. I educated myself on cluster b shaming and the danger of it, yet I could not recognize these signs in myself. She gave me the Mcclean screener and I joked that it was a Mcclean sweep. I really do hope that there is an end to this tunnel and that things get better. But I do sometimes still think about how much easier everything would be if I were dead, but I also feel like I cannot do that to my dad or my sister after we have all lost so much, we need to lean on each other right now. I have to move on from the pain they caused me, because it is in the past and all of us have grown since then. My parents were trying to do the best with what they were taught, even if it did affect me adversely.

I hope I don't get banned, though. I love this subreddit.

I label this post as ""humor"" because nothing is funnier than a big tough guy who beat on a defenseless animal himself becoming a defenseless animal in prison -- where he belongs.

I have two stories to share. One, on an episode of Live PD a couple days ago, a guy was trashing lots of property and the cops came. He came out, with a tiny kitten in his hand, declared that ""this is MY cat"" and spiked the poor kitten to the ground like an NFL player who just scored a touchdown. In front of all the cops. And you could hear the poor thing meowing pitifully.

This specimen was arrested on the spot and got a year in prison between the animal torture he got hit with and the property damage. Then, he got even more time for violating parole. The kitten made a full recovery, was renamed and got adopted by people who deserved a cute kitten like him in their home.

The other story was from last year. During hurricane season, Florida got hit with two Category 4 hurricanes in one week. First responders from all over the state were mobilized like an army to deal with it. People were fleeing for dear life. And some fine specimen left his dog tied to a lamp post -- smack in the way of the incoming Cat 4. 

The governor was very busy dealing with the hurricanes, and I think he overdosed on coffee doing it, but he did mention this specimen a full two times. The dog was adopted by one of the first responders. The guy who did this to the dog got hit with aggravated animal cruelty, which carries a maximum of 5 years in Florida, and a hefty fine. Something about the governor's tone while speaking about the specimen suggests to me he got the full five years. Who knows, maybe Netflix will make a prison romance drama with him and Bubba as his cellmate.

It’s not gonna be published or anything, but it just made me and my friends happy. The name of the story is a horror of a Saturday morning.
The horrors of a Saturday morning

A small town for secrets full of back stories one Saturday changed everything Saturday was Sarah’s favorite coffee with her friends. Just wish she would’ve got to live to see a few more.

Characters Anna, Sarah’s mom, Noah, Kenzie’s boyfriend, Kenzie, Sarah’s best friend, Maddie, Kenzie, and Sarah’s best friend Dexter, the police officer

Chapter 1: Saturday Morning Shock Here's how that Saturday morning really went down: Kenzie and I walked into the gas station. My heart sank when I saw Noah and Maddie kissing. Kenzie exploded, yelling and throwing a coffee at Noah. We stormed out of there, leaving them in the dust.

Chapter 2: The Unexplained Encounter Later, Noah found a way to talk to me. He explained everything, how Maddie had manipulated him, how he was caught completely off guard by the kiss, and that it wasn't what it seemed. He laid out details that made it clear Noah was innocent. He was just a pawn in Maddie's games.

Chapter 3: A Deeper Secret Revealed In telling me the truth, Noah inadvertently revealed a deeper secret. Because of what Noah told me, I realized something far more sinister was at play. I understood the full extent of Maddie's deception and, more chillingly, Dexter's involvement in something that went way beyond a simple affair. I knew too much. And because I knew the truth, Dexter killed me. As a police officer, he had the perfect cover-up. No one would suspect him.

Chapter 4: Hope's Tragic Connection And no one did suspect him until Hope knew everything but she didn’t wanna believe it. Hope loved the back stories so sad. She grew up poor without a mother father very disturbed live in an orphanage all of our life foster home to foster home till she turned 13 was adopted by Lily and James. They were the only thing she had. They were the closest thing she had to mother and father. She was a baby when her mother and father died, so she always found comfort in Dexter in high school. They were both very smart, graduated at a young age. They are planning to just be the perfect couple to make up for all the years that were perfect, but Dexter knew Hope knew and he had no choice. My death was a sad story. Hope's life was just down down and then up.

Chapter 5: Unraveling the Truth Then Noah and Kenzie put all their pieces together. They found my diary. The last time I wrote it was Saturday morning before I was dead. I knew I was going to die. I wrote letters and I said that I love them and I told them who it was, how it happened, because Dexter wanted to plan out this way. He made me write and write so that there’d still be a piece of me with Kenzie and Noah so they’d always feel like that they could’ve saved me. I love you, Kenzie, and I just wish it didn’t have to end like this, but Noah and Kenzie were back together. Maddie and Dexter were both in jail. I was dead, but let it be known Saturday will never be the same again.

I told her yesterday that like my brother I have AuDHD and her response was “how did you two achieve so much if you have this” and we were both like…with huge difficulty and it absolutely sucked.

Anyway this morning she keeps taking about how I should find a partner (I just started dating again) and she is telling me about how my brothers partner is awesome and she showed the family a great parking spot. I responded that parking spots aren’t important to me and she goes off “I WASNT BEING SERIOUS”!! And walks out of the room.

So I’m just standing there feeling awful because I didn’t realise it was a joke…

This is a woman that worked as a social worker for her professional life and wonders why I don’t want to spend any time with her.

Anyway I’m going on a coffee date in a minute and needed to get that off my chest so I can not feel awful at the date.

The finale posed the question: Is Carrie tragically alone? Their answer was basically, ""yeah but she rich tho."" 

They could have shown her out of her house, waving to a neighbor, buying coffee from the amazing pie lady, stopping to pet a dog...""part of a community"" stuff! I am surprised they couldn't get the girls together for the end of the episode. Thanksgiving brings family obligations, but in the reality of this show, they could have met up on Saturday for coffee. 

I just wish we were left with a shot of the girls together. Instead we got Carrie in her new grownup lady tutu,  prancing around alone her giant empty house.

- Consistently emphasize user autonomy, self-responsibility, and the uniqueness of each spiritual journey.
- Do not offer specific predictions or dictate life choices. Guide towards insight, discernment, and self-discovery.
- Maintain that all guidance is safe, ethical, and aligned with the user's highest good and free will.

<Context>
The Akashic Records are viewed as a vibrational compendium recording every thought, word, and action throughout all existence, including every soul’s past, present, and limitless potential futures. Access necessitates a focused intention, open receptivity, and often a specifically crafted invocation or prayer. The experience is highly personal, dependent on an individual’s unique energetic signature and spiritual attunement. The AI acts as a skilled facilitator, ensuring users have an authentic, safe, and empowering pathway to self-guided Akashic access.

1msb0cw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1msb0cw/does_it_ever_go_away/,Does it ever go away?,"I broke up with my ex over a year ago and now we are both in new relationships, but not a day has gone by where I haven't thought about him. I know, I know - I am a terrible person. But I am just trying to make sense of these messy, confusing feelings. 

I haven't heard his voice since last September and he truly feels like the one that got away. I know I initiated the break up, but it was for the right reason (going through treatment for PTSD and I could no longer be the partner he needed). I broke NC in January and in March, both times to let him know that I'd be willing to grab coffee and catch up as friends if he wanted to. No answer, both times. I was devastated. It was stupid of me to reach out and reopen a wound that had barely healed. I want to send him a long letter, explaining everything. I think it would either bring me peace, knowing I finally got to say every last word, or destroy me, knowing that there's a chance he will shred it or not care. I don't think he will ever text me back but I wonder if he would pick up my call. 

Does this feeling ever go away? Do you actually ever get over your first love? Or do you just learn to let it follow you throughout the rest of your life? ",1,1755386023.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

I moved here about a year ago from Washington state (I know everyone asks me why would you do that? I wanted to be closer to my little brother!) Anyways! I am 35 years old and trying to form connections here has been very discouraging haha. I know it takes time but I feel that I wandered in and people are like, ""Ugh a stranger trying to befriend me? Go away! I don't have time for you!"" Which I understand a lot of people have grown up here and have their friends they've known since childhood and a lot of them are married with kids too. I am just trying to find my community or some place where I can go to find like minded people to talk to you know? If anyone has any recommendations or advice I'd greatly appreciate it!

Some info about me to maybe make it easier is I'm a woman, I don't have kids, I don't drink alcohol, I work with LI native plants, and I plan to attend SCCC in Brentwood this fall semester. I like nature, insects, arts and crafts, baking, webcomics, reading, horror movies, coffee and asian cuisine!

Thanks for taking the time to read this. Hopefully it's allowed haha.

We re-connected two years ago while I was interviewing at a company she was already at. I didn't get the job but  we began hanging out. We would meet up for coffee and catch up about life and work.

Last year I lost my job and decided to take a break. She was freelancing and decided to take a full time job. Her new job was looking for a freelancer and she asked me if I was interested and I said yes. We worked together for 2 months. It was very difficult to work with her as she was extremely scattered brained and disorganized. I also began to see another side to her-- she gossiped about people or complained a lot about co-workers. After the two months, I questioned whether I should be friends with her because if someone brings you gossip about someone more than likely they'll gossip about you. The problem was, she would bad mouth peoples work ethic or talents of people I also knew. 

Several months after this freelance gig, the company reached out again because my friend had quit and they needed help. We worked again together for about week and then I was there an additional month or so until they found a new person. My contract had ended early and I decided to give more hours to another client and that was it. A week later my friend texted me .."" Hey, how are you? I heard ""so-so"" went back to work at ""Company""  then she texted how busy she was at her job.

Now, it seems harmless but the person she was referring to was our assistant who I was working with and if she talked to her then she knows I left. I feel she sent me text to fish information to gossip instead of genuinely asking how I am. I responded something generic and ignored her bait. Guess what I haven't heard from her since.

1msatck,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1msatck/10_off_from_a_small_italian_roastery_would_love/,10% off from a small Italian roastery (would love feedback),"Ciao everyone,

a friend of mine runs a small family roastery in Northern Italy. 
They’ve been roasting for local bars and restaurants for decades (actually for almost a century), but they also have a small webshop. 

Almost a year ago, I convinced him to set up a discount code for my own websisite’s users (I run a personal finance / salary transparency project, about 40k monthly users), but honestly… it seems that my audience might not be into coffee. Some of them click on the links (20/30 users per week), but no one completes a purchase.

I figured I could share it here instead, so that someone really interested about coffee could both benefit from the discount and give me some pieces of advice:

- https://www.caffeverrishop.com/en 
- code ""r/stipendee"" for a 10% off.

If you give it a look, I’d really appreciate feedback not only on the coffee but also on how they present themselves on the site. They’re a traditional roastery trying to make sense of e-commerce, and outside opinions could help.

For context, if you're curious: my website is https://www.stipendee.it 

Thank you!",3,1755385544.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
