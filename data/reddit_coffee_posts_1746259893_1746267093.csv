1kdpkyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/OverexplainedEmotions/comments/1kdpkyn/the_intricacies_of_laundryinduced_emotional/,The Intricacies of Laundry-Induced Emotional Fluctuations,"While engaged in the seemingly mundane activity of folding laundry, one might not expect to encounter a rich tapestry of emotional experiences. However, upon closer examination, this task reveals itself as a veritable petri dish of intricate feelings, particularly 'Chore-Related Anticipatory Ennui'‚Äîa specific subtype of generalized chore-induced emotional oscillation.

This sensation commences with a preliminary phase characterized by 'Initial Dread Pulse' (IDP), manifesting as a mild electrostatic-like tingle in the epidermis. It's akin to anticipating a tepid coffee, just bearable but never quite satisfying. IDP eventually escalates into a more palpable 'Resigned Agitation Flux' (RAF), a unique emotional waveform that resonates with frequencies often observed while staring down an impending to-do list.

Visual stimuli play an unexpected role in amplifying RAF, as the vibrant contrast between socks and towels serves as a neural accelerant, driving the amplitude of RAF to new heights. Simultaneously, the nascent 'Folding Solace' (FS) begins to subtly integrate into the emotional matrix, constituting roughly 27% of the emotional composite by the time T-shirt origami peaks.

This FS can be quantified as a pseudo-endorphin release, moderately augmenting cardiovascular rhythm, effectively pushing RAF toward cessation. Eventually, harmony is achieved at the conclusion of the chore‚Äîperhaps the emotional equivalent of an aviation landing gear retraction symbolizing tranquility after operational intensity. This ultimately leaves one in Phase 3 of Chore-Related Anticipatory Ennui, subtype: 'Satisfaction of Task Completion'.

The nuanced interplay of these emotional subtypes during laundry folding endeavors to highlight just how profoundly textured the human emotional experience can be, even in the most ordinary of tasks. It's a whimsical dance of feelings that, while humorous in its absurdity, invites a re-evaluation of the very science of emotion itself. Perhaps next time, we will tackle the trials and tribulations of waiting for bread to toast...an emotionally charged journey all its own.",1,1746267004.0,OverexplainedEmotions,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm Nathan, I work in the animation industry and couldn‚Äôt find a preschool show that:

* kept kids engaged busy for one cup of coffee,
* had actual education like real phonics, counting & SEL into the fun, and
* showed a main character who looks like half the kids in our family.

So I teamed up with an early-years practitioner who also voices Temi - to create Temi‚Äôs World. The channel went live three hours ago and is free on YouTube.

What you‚Äôll see:

* üñçÔ∏è Temi (age 5) solving little everyday problems‚Äîcounting, letter sounds, sharing.
* Mini ‚Äúpause & play‚Äù prompts so kids can shout answers instead of zoning out.
* Closed captions & printable activity sheet (PDF) if you want to turn it into today‚Äôs literacy block.

I‚Äôd love feedback from the people who know at-home learning best:

1. Does it *actually* buy you a peaceful 10 minutes?
2. Anything feel preachy, off-base, or just boring?
3. What would you want to see more of?

The Refugees (critical project analysis and data sharing)","# Two Years Later: What We Got Right, What We Got Wrong, and What We Learned

When we started working on [We. The Refugees: Ticket to Europe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/), we didn‚Äôt have a publisher, a studio, or even a real budget. Just an idea, a lot of questions, and more ambition than we probably should‚Äôve had. Two years after release, the game was nominated to and received international awards, has earned a dedicated niche following, and a respectable 83% positive rating on Steam ‚Äî but financially, it hasn‚Äôt been the success we hoped for.

This post mortem is a look behind the curtain: how the game was born, how we pulled it off with limited resources, what mistakes we made (some of them big), and what we‚Äôd do differently next time. It‚Äôs part reflection, part open notebook ‚Äî for fellow devs, curious players, and anyone wondering what it really takes to make a politically charged narrative game in 2020s Europe.

Let‚Äôs start at the beginning.

# The Origins of the Game

The idea behind *We. The Refugees* goes back to 2014‚Äì2015, when news about the emerging refugee crisis began making global headlines. At the time, the two co-founders of Act Zero ‚Äî Jƒôdrzej Napiecek and Maciej Sta≈Ñczyk ‚Äî were QA testers working on *The Witcher 3* at Testronic. During coffee breaks, they‚Äôd talk about their desire to create something of their own: a narrative-driven game with a message. They were particularly inspired by *This War of Mine* from 11 bit studios ‚Äî one of the first widely recognized examples of a so-called ""meaningful game."" All of these ingredients became the base for the cocktail that would eventually become our first game.¬†

At first, the project was just a modest side hustle ‚Äî an attempt to create a game about refugees that could help players better understand a complex issue. Over the next few years, we researched the topic, built a small team, and searched for funding. Eventually, we secured a micro-budget from a little-known publisher (who soon disappeared from the industry). That collaboration didn‚Äôt last long, but it gave us enough momentum to build a very bad prototype and organize a research trip to refugee camps on the Greek island of Lesbos.

That trip changed everything. It made us realize how little we truly understood ‚Äî even after years of preparation. The contrast between our secondhand knowledge and the reality on the ground was jarring. That confrontation became a defining theme of the game. We restructured the narrative around it: not as a refugee survival simulator, but as a story about someone trying ‚Äî and often failing ‚Äî to understand. In the new version, the player steps into the shoes of an amateur journalist at the start of his career. You can learn more about it in the [documentary film ](https://youtu.be/Icb5bEAVwag?si=k6EdyYM1nys_ZeAm)showcasing our development and creative process.

But for a moment we have no money to continue the development of *We. The Refugees*. For the next year and a half, the studio kept itself afloat with contract work ‚Äî mainly developing simulator games for companies in the PlayWay group ‚Äî while we continued our hunt for funding. Finally, in 2019, we received an EU grant to build the game, along with a companion comic book and board game on the same subject. From the first conversation over coffee to actual financing, the road took about five years.

# Budget and Production

The EU grant we received totaled 425,000 PLN ‚Äî roughly $100,000. But that sum had to stretch across three different projects: a video game, a board game, and a comic book. While some costs overlapped ‚Äî particularly in visual development ‚Äî we estimate that the actual budget allocated to the *We. The Refugees* video game was somewhere in the range of $70,000‚Äì$80,000.

The production timeline stretched from May 2020 to May 2023 ‚Äî three full years. That‚Äôs a long time for an indie game of this size, but the reasons were clear:

First, the script was enormous ‚Äî around 300,000 words, or roughly two-thirds the length of The *Witcher 3*‚Äôs narrative. Writing alone took nearly 20 months.

Second, the budget didn‚Äôt allow for a full-time team. We relied on freelance contracts, which meant most contributors worked part-time, often on evenings and weekends. That slowed us down ‚Äî but it also gave us access to talented professionals from major studios, who wouldn‚Äôt have been available under a traditional staffing model.

We built the game in the Godot engine, mainly because it‚Äôs open-source and produces lightweight builds ‚Äî which we hoped would make future mobile ports easier (a plan that ultimately didn‚Äôt materialize). As our CTO and designer Maciej Sta≈Ñczyk put it:

*Technically speaking, Godot‚Äôs a solid tool ‚Äî but porting is a pain. For this project, I‚Äôd still choose it. But if you‚Äôre thinking beyond PC, you need to plan carefully.*

Over the course of production, around 15 people contributed in some capacity. Most worked on narrowly defined tasks ‚Äî like creating a few specific animations. About 10 were involved intermittently, while the core team consisted of about five people who carried the project forward. Of those, only one ‚Äî our CEO and lead writer Jƒôdrzej Napiecek ‚Äî worked on the game full-time. The rest balanced it with other jobs.

We ran the project entirely remotely. In hindsight, it was the only viable option. Renting a physical studio would‚Äôve burned through our budget in a matter of months. And for a game like this ‚Äî long on writing, short on gameplay mechanics ‚Äî full-time roles weren‚Äôt always necessary. A full-time programmer, for instance, would‚Äôve spent much of the project waiting for things to script. Given the constraints, we think the budget was spent as efficiently as possible.

# Marketing and Wishlists

For the first leg of the marketing campaign, we handled everything ourselves ‚Äî posting regularly on Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Between July and October 2022, those grassroots efforts brought in around 1,000 wishlists. Modest, but promising. During that period, we took part in Steam Next Fest ‚Äî a decision we later came to regret. Sure, our wishlist count doubled, but we were starting from such a low base that the absolute numbers were underwhelming. In hindsight, we would‚Äôve seen a much bigger impact if we had joined the event closer to launch, when our wishlist count was higher and the game had more visibility.

Then, in November 2022, our publisher came on board. Within just two days, our wishlist count jumped by 2,000. It looked impressive ‚Äî at first. They told us the spike came from mailing list campaigns. But when we dug into the data, we found something odd: the vast majority of those wishlists came from Russia. Actual sales in that region? Just a few dozen copies... We still don‚Äôt know what really happened ‚Äî whether it was a mailing list fluke, a bot issue, or something else entirely. But the numbers didn‚Äôt add up, and that initial spike never translated into meaningful engagement. You can see that spike here - it‚Äôs the biggest one:

https://preview.redd.it/xbntaknhgjye1.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fae8539ab26f571cb32b341af6c4b13771c588d9

From there, wishlist growth slowed. Over the next six months ‚Äî the lead-up to launch ‚Äî we added about 1,000 more wishlists. To put it bluntly: in four months of DIY marketing, we‚Äôd done about as well as the publisher did over half a year. Not exactly a glowing endorsement.

That said, the launch itself went reasonably well. The publisher managed to generate some nice visibility, generating about 50K visits on our Steam Page on the day of the premiere.

https://preview.redd.it/9ylqyrwigjye1.jpg?width=1265&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d6b504f540f2be9ca746c3b988ba5f9ec97b230

You can compare it to our lifetime results - we managed to gather 12.33 million impressions and 1,318,116 visits of our Steam Page during both marketing and sales phases:

https://preview.redd.it/9wrm1w2mgjye1.jpg?width=1243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94b16029f3948a06d6b0e0c61cba9d226331b6e6

It‚Äôs worth noting that nearly 50 titles launched on Steam the same day we did. Among them, we managed to climb to the #3 spot in terms of popularity. A small victory, sure ‚Äî but one that highlights just how fierce the competition is on the platform.¬†

Looking back, the launch may not have delivered blockbuster sales, but it did well enough to keep the game from vanishing into the depths of Steam‚Äôs archive. It‚Äôs still alive, still visible, and ‚Äî to our mild surprise ‚Äî still selling, if slowly.

After the premiere we saw a healthy bump: roughly 2,500 new wishlists in the month following release. By early June 2023, our total had climbed to around 6,300. After that, growth was slower but steady. We crossed the 10,000-wishlist mark in May 2024, a full year after launch. Since then, things have tapered off. Over the past twelve months, we‚Äôve added just 1,500 more wishlists. Here are our actual wishlist stats:

https://preview.redd.it/z6mfgzipgjye1.jpg?width=1127&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d0bd63c7471e5b3354f50246eb0d073139db8c

During the promotional period, we also visited many in-person events: EGX London, PAX East Boston, GDC San Francisco, BLON Klaipeda. We managed to obtain the budget for these trips - mostly - from additional grants for the international development of the company. And while these trips allowed us to establish interesting industry contacts, the impact on wish lists was negligible. In our experience - it is better to invest money in online marketing than to pay for expensive stands at fairs.

# Sales

Two years post-launch, We. The Refugees has sold 3,653 copies ‚Äî plus around 259 retail activations ‚Äî with 211 refunds. That‚Äôs a 5.8% refund rate, and an average of about five sales per day since release.

https://preview.redd.it/bbhzxzltgjye1.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53bc40d9b2bf6757bef350199926e8d5b484881a

China turned out to be our biggest market by far, accounting for 46% of all sales. The credit goes entirely to our Chinese partner, Gamersky, who handled localization and regional distribution. They did outstanding work ‚Äî not just on the numbers, but on communication, responsiveness, and professionalism. Partnering with them was, without question, one of our best decisions. Our second-largest market was the U.S. at 16%, followed by Poland at 6%. That last figure might seem surprising, but we need to highlight that Act Zero is a Polish studio and the game is fully localized in Polish.

https://preview.redd.it/6omaspbvgjye1.jpg?width=703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f82551334205a9ef2a6b74f41bba86a3a5c67329

Looking at our daily sales chart, the pattern is clear: most purchases happen during Steam festivals or seasonal sales. Outside of those events, daily numbers drop sharply ‚Äî often to near-zero. As of now, our lifetime conversion rate sits at 10.7%, slightly below the Steam average.

We haven‚Äôt yet tested ultra-deep discounts (like -90%), which may still offer some upside. But for now, the game‚Äôs long tail is exactly what you'd expect from a niche, dialogue-heavy title without a major marketing push.

Initially, we had higher hopes. We believed 10,000 copies in the first year was a realistic target. But a mix of limited marketing, creative risks, and production compromises made that goal harder to reach. In the next section, we‚Äôll try to unpack what exactly went wrong ‚Äî and what we‚Äôd do differently next time.

# Mistakes & Lessons Learned

* **No Map or True Exploration**

*We. The Refugees* is a game about a journey from North Africa to Southern Europe ‚Äî yet ironically, the game lacks the feeling of freedom and movement that such a journey should evoke. The player follows a mostly linear, pre-scripted route with some branches along the way. The main route of the journey is more or less the same, although there are different ways of exploring specific sections of the route. Even a simple map with optional detours could‚Äôve dramatically improved immersion. Moving gameplay choices about the next destination onto such a map would also be highly recommended ‚Äî it would definitely liven up interactions on the left side of the screen, where illustrations are displayed. Clicking on them would simply offer a refreshing change from the usual dialogue choices shown beneath the text on the right side of the screen. After all, the ‚Äújourney‚Äù is a powerful narrative and gameplay topos ‚Äî one that many players find inherently engaging. Unfortunately, our game didn‚Äôt reflect this in its systems or structure.

* **Too Little Gameplay, Too Much Reading**

Players didn‚Äôt feel like they were actively participating ‚Äî and in a modern RPG or visual novel, interactivity is key. Introducing simple mechanics, like dice checks during major decisions or a basic quest log, would‚Äôve helped structure the action and add dramatic tension. These are familiar tools that players have come to expect, and we shouldn't have overlooked them.

* **Personality Traits with No Real Impact**

The player character had a set of personality traits, but they were largely cosmetic. Occasionally, a trait would unlock a unique dialogue option, but in practice, these had little to no impact on how the story unfolded. We missed a major opportunity here. Traits could have formed the backbone of a dice-based gameplay system, where they meaningfully influenced outcomes by providing bonuses or penalties to specific checks ‚Äî adding depth, variety, and replay value.

* **Mispositioned Pitch**

From the start, we positioned the game as a story about refugees ‚Äî a highly politicized topic that immediately turned away many potential players. Some assumed we were pushing propaganda. But our actual intent was far more nuanced: we tried to show the refugee issue from multiple perspectives, without preaching or moralizing ‚Äî trusting players to draw their own conclusions from the situations we presented.

Looking back, a better framing would‚Äôve been: a young journalist‚Äôs first investigative assignment ‚Äî which happens to deal with refugees. This would‚Äôve made the game far more approachable. The refugee theme could remain central, but framed as part of a broader, more relatable fantasy of becoming a journalist.

* **A Problematic Protagonist**

We aimed to create a non-heroic protagonist ‚Äî not a hardened war reporter, but an ordinary person, similar to the average player. Someone unprepared, naive, flawed. Our goal was to satirize the Western gaze, but many players found this portrayal alienating. It was hard to empathize with a character who often made dumb mistakes or revealed glaring ignorance.

The idea itself wasn‚Äôt bad ‚Äî challenging the ‚Äúcool protagonist‚Äù fantasy can be powerful ‚Äî but we executed it clumsily. We gave the main character too many flaws, to the point where satire and immersion clashed. A better approach might‚Äôve been to delegate those satirical traits to a companion character, letting the player avatar stay more neutral. As our CTO Maciej Sta≈Ñczyk put it:

*I still think a protagonist who‚Äôs unlikable at first isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad idea ‚Äî but you have to spell it out clearly, because players are used to stepping into the shoes of someone cool right away.*

* **A Static, Uninviting Prologue**

The game‚Äôs prologue begins with the protagonist sitting in his apartment, staring at a laptop (starting conditions exactly the same as the situation of our player right now!), moments before leaving for Africa. On paper, it seemed clever ‚Äî metatextual, symbolic. In practice, it was static and uninvolving. Many players dropped the game during this segment.

Ironically, the very next scene ‚Äî set in Africa ‚Äî was widely praised as engaging and atmospheric. In hindsight, we should‚Äôve opened in medias res, grabbing the player‚Äôs attention from the first few minutes. Again, Maciej Sta≈Ñczyk summed it up well:

*The prologue is well-written and nicely sets up the character, but players expect a hook in the first few minutes ‚Äî like starting the story right in the middle of the action.*

* **No Saving Option**

The decision to disable saving at any moment during gameplay turned out to be a mistake. Our intention was to emphasize the weight of each choice and discourage save scumming. However, in practice, it became a frustrating limitation‚Äîespecially for our most dedicated and engaged players, who wanted to explore different narrative branches but were repeatedly forced to replay large portions of the game.

* **Late and Weak Marketing**

We started marketing way too late. We had no budget for professionals and little expertise ourselves. We tried to learn on the fly, but lacked time, resources, and experience. What we could have done better was involve the community much earlier. As Maciej Sta≈Ñczyk notes:

*Biggest lesson? Involve your community as early as possible. Traditional marketing only works if you‚Äôve got at least a AA+ budget. Indies have to be loud and visible online from the earliest stages ‚Äî like the guy behind Roadwarden, whose posts I saw years before launch.*

**Final Thoughts on Mistakes**

If we were to start this project all over again, two priorities would guide our design: more interactive gameplay and freedom to explore the journey via a world map. Both would significantly increase immersion and player engagement.

Could we have achieved that with the budget we had? Probably not. But that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that now we know better ‚Äî and we intend to apply those lessons to our next project.

# Closing Thoughts

Two years after launch, we‚Äôre proud of how [We. The Refugees](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/) has been received. The game holds an 83% positive rating on Steam and has earned nominations and awards at several international festivals. We won Games for Good Award at IndieX in Portugal, received a nomination to Best in Civics Award at Games for Change in New York, and another to Aware Game Awards at BLON in Lithuania. For a debut indie title built on a shoestring budget, that‚Äôs not nothing.

We‚Äôre also proud of the final product itself. Despite some narrative missteps, we believe the writing holds up ‚Äî both in terms of quality and relevance. As the years go by, the game may even gain value as a historical snapshot of a particular state of mind. The story ends just as the COVID-19 lockdowns begin ‚Äî a moment that, in hindsight, marked the end of a certain era. In the five years since, history has accelerated. The comfortable notion of the ‚ÄúEnd of History‚Äù (to borrow from Fukuyama) ‚Äî so common in Western discourse ‚Äî has given way to a harsher, more conflict-driven reality. In that context, our protagonist might be seen as a portrait of a fading worldview. A symbol of the mindset that once shaped liberal Western optimism, now slipping into obsolescence. And perhaps that alone is reason enough for the game to remain interesting in the years to come ‚Äî as a kind of time capsule, a record of a specific cultural moment.

This reflection also marks the closing of a chapter for our studio. While we still have a few surprises in store for *We. The Refugees*, our attention has already shifted to what lies ahead. We‚Äôre now putting the finishing touches on the prototype for *Venus Rave* ‚Äî a sci-fi RPG with a much stronger gameplay core (which, let‚Äôs be honest, wasn‚Äôt hard to improve given how minimal gameplay was in *We. The Refugees*). The next phase of development still lacks a secured budget, but thanks to everything we‚Äôve learned on our first project, we‚Äôre walking into this one better prepared ‚Äî and determined not to repeat the same mistakes.

Whether we get to make that next game depends on whether someone out there believes in us enough to invest. Because, to be completely honest, the revenue from our first title won‚Äôt be enough to fund another one on its own.",1,1746266591.0,SeriousGames,0,1.0,False

1kdph2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kdph2o/was_it_worth_it/,Was it worth it?,"I am a scientist. Or at least, I used to be. But something changed during the Hyperion test. Something irreversible. And now I don‚Äôt even know if I qualify as human.

I know how that sounds. But I‚Äôm not here to convince you‚ÄîI just need to tell someone. Anyone. Before whatever‚Äôs inside me finishes what it started.

The day began like most do in Chicago‚Äîgray, buzzing, tired. I woke up from a dream I can‚Äôt fully remember. Only fragments remain: warm sunlight, laughter, my mother‚Äôs voice. It was a cruel contrast to the morning that greeted me. My apartment was cold. My limbs ached. I dressed in silence, shivering as I pulled on my lab coat. A high-end one, supposedly. Though after so many years in the field, even prestige feels like polyester and lint.

I skipped breakfast. Nerves, maybe. Or maybe some part of me knew. I drank stale coffee from a cracked mug and stepped outside.

The city was a living thing. Cabs blared. Crowds swelled. Skyscrapers clawed the sky. Most people rushed around me, blind to the leviathan sleeping beneath their feet. Hyperion. Our magnum opus. A particle accelerator hidden in the guts of Chicago, built to simulate the earliest birth pangs of the universe. Our goal? Recreate a Big Bang‚Äîjust on a smaller scale.

The test was that morning. Years of work, billions of dollars, and sleepless nights culminating in one moment.

I should‚Äôve been ecstatic. But instead, as I neared the lab‚Äôs steel-and-glass entrance, a pressure bloomed in my gut. Like my body was warning me to turn back. I ignored it. Told myself it was excitement.

The lab was alive with anticipation. Halls glowed sterile white, filled with the low thrum of servers and hushed conversation. As I reached the observation level, I spotted Mitch, clipboard in hand, grin plastered across his face.

‚ÄúMorning, John,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúReady to make history?‚Äù

I smiled, though it felt brittle. ‚ÄúAll systems green?‚Äù

‚ÄúShelly just finished the final diagnostics downstairs. Should be back any second.‚Äù

The lab beyond the viewing window shimmered with soft blue lights. Rows of control panels flickered. Cables snaked across the floor like veins in a giant, sleeping beast. When Shelly emerged from the side door with a thumbs-up, the room sprang to life.

‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù Mitch said, voice buzzing through the intercom, ‚Äúcommencing test one of Project Hyperion. Please step back from the glass.‚Äù

The accelerator‚Äôs hum crawled through the walls. My fingertips tingled. The air thickened, charged. I could feel the machine waking up.

‚ÄúFive‚Ä¶‚Äù

My breath caught in my throat.

‚ÄúFour‚Ä¶‚Äù

My nails dug into the foam of my armrest.

‚ÄúThree‚Ä¶‚Äù

Sweat pooled at the small of my back.

‚ÄúTwo‚Ä¶‚Äù

My heart was thunder.

‚ÄúOne.‚Äù

BOOM.

Everything went black.

But it wasn‚Äôt unconsciousness‚Äînot truly. It felt more like falling out of reality.

When my senses returned, I was‚Ä¶ nowhere. Suspended in a void that pulsed with red and black. The sky was a swirling mess of maroon clouds and a bloated black star that throbbed like a wound. Beneath me, a crimson ocean rolled, thick as blood and just as ominous.

I tried to move. My limbs didn‚Äôt respond.

I looked down‚Äîand screamed. My legs were gone, replaced by a tapering, muscular tail that writhed in the air like a severed nerve. My arms ended in elongated claws, glistening black and insectile. My skin sagged and rippled, gelatinous. I reached for my face and felt wet folds, soft and melting. My mouth‚Äîmy mouth was gone.

I floated. A deformed mutation of the man I‚Äôd once been.

And then I saw them.

The eyes.

Enormous, lidless orbs hovered just beyond the clouds. Miles wide. Pitch black. Watching with the kind of indifference that made prayer feel ridiculous. As the clouds parted, the rest of the thing emerged. A body too vast for sanity. Crimson scales that shimmered like burning coals. Limbs‚Äîif you could call them that‚Äîspiraled with tendrils and teeth. Its mouth opened wide, wider than physics should allow, and the black mist that poured out carried the stench of rot and ozone.

I was pulled toward it.

I fought. Clawed. Screamed silently. But resistance meant nothing.

Its teeth weren‚Äôt teeth. They were monoliths‚Äîtowers of yellowed bone that scraped the heavens. I slipped between them and into the dark.

Inside its mouth, it wasn‚Äôt dark at all. It was alive.

Tentacles slithered from the walls. Each ended in a sucker-like mouth ringed with glinting, obsidian fangs. They latched onto me, biting, gnawing, burrowing. My flesh‚Äîor what used to be my own flesh‚Äîpeeled away in wet chunks. One sank its fangs into my skull. All I could think of was my own regret. I had failed, my vision, my dream had completely and utterly failed. I did not even question my own situation. I merely accepted.

Just as the pain became unbearable, I awoke.

In Colorado.

The plains stretched endless and golden. The sky hung gray and low. My legs were back. My skin was whole. Ahead stood my childhood home‚Äîpaint peeling, porch sagging. And through the window‚Ä¶ her.

My mother.

She stood at the stove, humming. The scent of chicken pot pie drifted into the air‚Äîmy favorite. She had been gone for three years. Kidney cancer. Quick and cruel. I missed her last breath by twelve hours. A snowstorm, the biggest Chicago had seen in the past decade, had delayed my flight. I should‚Äôve flown out sooner. Hyperion was too demanding a project. I was always needed, always pushing the extra mile. I‚Äôd always felt a bit of guilt, as if my own ambitions let my mother die alone. Questions always gnawed at me. What were her last words? Would my presence have eased her passing? 

These questions ate at me as I stepped onto the porch. I knocked.

She didn‚Äôt respond.

I opened the door. It gave way with a familiar creak.

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù I called.

She turned. Same soft face. Same gentle smile.

But the warmth wasn‚Äôt there. Her eyes were wrong. A shade too dark. Her smile bent just slightly in the middle, as if being held in place by wire.

‚ÄúJohn,‚Äù she said, voice melodic but hollow. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been so long. Did your project work?‚Äù

She came closer. I backed away.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt recognize your own mother?‚Äù

Her face sagged. Her arms lengthened. Claws split from her fingertips. Her legs fused into a tail. The skin melted, drooped. She became me.

A grotesque mirror of what I‚Äôd become.

‚ÄúThe project worked, right?‚Äù it‚ÄîI‚Äîwhimpered. ‚ÄúWe succeeded, didn‚Äôt we?‚Äù

Then came the tendrils. The gnashing mouths. They tore me apart‚Äîmy reflection, my guilt, my sin.

‚ÄúWas it worth it?‚Äù it choked before being dragged into the wall.

The house began to collapse. The walls pulsed like a dying heart. I sank to the floor, cold and shaking. Maybe this was my punishment. A tomb shaped like memory.

Then‚Äî

I woke up.

Back in the lab. Flat on the floor. Mitch hovered above me, grinning like a lunatic.

‚ÄúJohn! Holy hell, you scared us! You passed out. But listen‚Äîwe did it. The data‚Äôs off the charts. This‚Ä¶ this is Nobel prize territory!‚Äù

He helped me to my feet. My knees wobbled.

‚ÄúWe did good, right?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWas it worth it?‚Äù

He blinked, confused. ‚ÄúOf course. For a discovery this big? I‚Äôd do it ten times over.‚Äù

He meant it.

I walked outside. The sun was out now. Life resumed. Nothing had changed.

Except me.

Now, I can‚Äôt sleep more than a few hours without seeing it. The thing in the sky. The tendrils. Myself‚Äîmelting, screaming.

And here‚Äôs the part that scares me most: the energy readings we pulled from that first test‚Ä¶ They don‚Äôt match anything in the known universe. Not even quantum anomalies. Not even chaos theory.

It‚Äôs like the machine opened a door to someplace else entirely. A quick glance into another plane of existence.

And I think‚Äîwhatever it was‚Äîlooked back. Whatever window we opened, it worked both ways.

So if I seem normal‚Äîlaughing, working, drinking coffee‚Äîknow this:

I am not human anymore. I‚Äôve become a husk, an entity assuming an echo of a name.

And every night, just before I close my eyes, I hear the echo of a question I‚Äôll never stop asking.

When we started working on [We.

Just an idea, a lot of questions, and more ambition than we probably should‚Äôve had. Two years after release, the game was nominated to and received international awards, has earned a dedicated niche following, and a respectable 83% positive rating on Steam ‚Äî but financially, it hasn‚Äôt been the success we hoped for.

This post mortem is a look behind the curtain: how the game was born, how we pulled it off with limited resources, what mistakes we made (some of them big), and what we‚Äôd do differently next time. It‚Äôs part reflection, part open notebook ‚Äî for fellow devs, curious players, and anyone wondering what it really takes to make a politically charged narrative game in 2020s Europe.

Let‚Äôs start at the beginning.

# The Origins of the Game

The idea behind *We. The Refugees* goes back to 2014‚Äì2015, when news about the emerging refugee crisis began making global headlines. At the time, the two co-founders of Act Zero ‚Äî Jƒôdrzej Napiecek and Maciej Sta≈Ñczyk ‚Äî were QA testers working on *The Witcher 3* at Testronic. During coffee breaks, they‚Äôd talk about their desire to create something of their own: a narrative-driven game with a message. They were particularly inspired by *This War of Mine* from 11 bit studios ‚Äî one of the first widely recognized examples of a so-called ""meaningful game."" All of these ingredients became the base for the cocktail that would eventually become our first game.¬†

At first, the project was just a modest side hustle ‚Äî an attempt to create a game about refugees that could help players better understand a complex issue. Over the next few years, we researched the topic, built a small team, and searched for funding. Eventually, we secured a micro-budget from a little-known publisher (who soon disappeared from the industry). That collaboration didn‚Äôt last long, but it gave us enough momentum to build a very bad prototype and organize a research trip to refugee camps on the Greek island of Lesbos.

That trip changed everything. It made us realize how little we truly understood ‚Äî even after years of preparation. The contrast between our secondhand knowledge and the reality on the ground was jarring. That confrontation became a defining theme of the game. We restructured the narrative around it: not as a refugee survival simulator, but as a story about someone trying ‚Äî and often failing ‚Äî to understand. In the new version, the player steps into the shoes of an amateur journalist at the start of his career. You can learn more about it in the [documentary film ](https://youtu.be/Icb5bEAVwag?si=k6EdyYM1nys_ZeAm)showcasing our development and creative process.

But for a moment we have no money to continue the development of *We. The Refugees*. For the next year and a half, the studio kept itself afloat with contract work ‚Äî mainly developing simulator games for companies in the PlayWay group ‚Äî while we continued our hunt for funding. Finally, in 2019, we received an EU grant to build the game, along with a companion comic book and board game on the same subject. From the first conversation over coffee to actual financing, the road took about five years.

# Budget and Production

The EU grant we received totaled 425,000 PLN ‚Äî roughly $100,000. But that sum had to stretch across three different projects: a video game, a board game, and a comic book. While some costs overlapped ‚Äî particularly in visual development ‚Äî we estimate that the actual budget allocated to the *We. The Refugees* video game was somewhere in the range of $70,000‚Äì$80,000.

The production timeline stretched from May 2020 to May 2023 ‚Äî three full years. That‚Äôs a long time for an indie game of this size, but the reasons were clear:

First, the script was enormous ‚Äî around 300,000 words, or roughly two-thirds the length of The *Witcher 3*‚Äôs narrative. Writing alone took nearly 20 months.

Second, the budget didn‚Äôt allow for a full-time team. We relied on freelance contracts, which meant most contributors worked part-time, often on evenings and weekends. That slowed us down ‚Äî but it also gave us access to talented professionals from major studios, who wouldn‚Äôt have been available under a traditional staffing model.

We built the game in the Godot engine, mainly because it‚Äôs open-source and produces lightweight builds ‚Äî which we hoped would make future mobile ports easier (a plan that ultimately didn‚Äôt materialize). As our CTO and designer Maciej Sta≈Ñczyk put it:

*Technically speaking, Godot‚Äôs a solid tool ‚Äî but porting is a pain. For this project, I‚Äôd still choose it. But if you‚Äôre thinking beyond PC, you need to plan carefully.*

Over the course of production, around 15 people contributed in some capacity. Most worked on narrowly defined tasks ‚Äî like creating a few specific animations. About 10 were involved intermittently, while the core team consisted of about five people who carried the project forward. Of those, only one ‚Äî our CEO and lead writer Jƒôdrzej Napiecek ‚Äî worked on the game full-time. The rest balanced it with other jobs.

We ran the project entirely remotely. In hindsight, it was the only viable option. Renting a physical studio would‚Äôve burned through our budget in a matter of months. And for a game like this ‚Äî long on writing, short on gameplay mechanics ‚Äî full-time roles weren‚Äôt always necessary. A full-time programmer, for instance, would‚Äôve spent much of the project waiting for things to script. Given the constraints, we think the budget was spent as efficiently as possible.

# Marketing and Wishlists

For the first leg of the marketing campaign, we handled everything ourselves ‚Äî posting regularly on Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Between July and October 2022, those grassroots efforts brought in around 1,000 wishlists. Modest, but promising. During that period, we took part in Steam Next Fest ‚Äî a decision we later came to regret. Sure, our wishlist count doubled, but we were starting from such a low base that the absolute numbers were underwhelming. In hindsight, we would‚Äôve seen a much bigger impact if we had joined the event closer to launch, when our wishlist count was higher and the game had more visibility.

Then, in November 2022, our publisher came on board. Within just two days, our wishlist count jumped by 2,000. It looked impressive ‚Äî at first. They told us the spike came from mailing list campaigns. But when we dug into the data, we found something odd: the vast majority of those wishlists came from Russia. Actual sales in that region? Just a few dozen copies... We still don‚Äôt know what really happened ‚Äî whether it was a mailing list fluke, a bot issue, or something else entirely. But the numbers didn‚Äôt add up, and that initial spike never translated into meaningful engagement. You can see that spike here - it‚Äôs the biggest one:

https://preview.redd.it/xbntaknhgjye1.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fae8539ab26f571cb32b341af6c4b13771c588d9

From there, wishlist growth slowed. Over the next six months ‚Äî the lead-up to launch ‚Äî we added about 1,000 more wishlists. To put it bluntly: in four months of DIY marketing, we‚Äôd done about as well as the publisher did over half a year. Not exactly a glowing endorsement.

That said, the launch itself went reasonably well. The publisher managed to generate some nice visibility, generating about 50K visits on our Steam Page on the day of the premiere.

https://preview.redd.it/9ylqyrwigjye1.jpg?width=1265&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d6b504f540f2be9ca746c3b988ba5f9ec97b230

You can compare it to our lifetime results - we managed to gather 12.33 million impressions and 1,318,116 visits of our Steam Page during both marketing and sales phases:

https://preview.redd.it/9wrm1w2mgjye1.jpg?width=1243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94b16029f3948a06d6b0e0c61cba9d226331b6e6

It‚Äôs worth noting that nearly 50 titles launched on Steam the same day we did. Among them, we managed to climb to the #3 spot in terms of popularity. A small victory, sure ‚Äî but one that highlights just how fierce the competition is on the platform.¬†

Looking back, the launch may not have delivered blockbuster sales, but it did well enough to keep the game from vanishing into the depths of Steam‚Äôs archive. It‚Äôs still alive, still visible, and ‚Äî to our mild surprise ‚Äî still selling, if slowly.

After the premiere we saw a healthy bump: roughly 2,500 new wishlists in the month following release. By early June 2023, our total had climbed to around 6,300. After that, growth was slower but steady. We crossed the 10,000-wishlist mark in May 2024, a full year after launch. Since then, things have tapered off. Over the past twelve months, we‚Äôve added just 1,500 more wishlists. Here are our actual wishlist stats:

https://preview.redd.it/z6mfgzipgjye1.jpg?width=1127&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d0bd63c7471e5b3354f50246eb0d073139db8c

During the promotional period, we also visited many in-person events: EGX London, PAX East Boston, GDC San Francisco, BLON Klaipeda. We managed to obtain the budget for these trips - mostly - from additional grants for the international development of the company. And while these trips allowed us to establish interesting industry contacts, the impact on wish lists was negligible. In our experience - it is better to invest money in online marketing than to pay for expensive stands at fairs.

# Sales

Two years post-launch, We. The Refugees has sold 3,653 copies ‚Äî plus around 259 retail activations ‚Äî with 211 refunds. That‚Äôs a 5.8% refund rate, and an average of about five sales per day since release.

https://preview.redd.it/bbhzxzltgjye1.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53bc40d9b2bf6757bef350199926e8d5b484881a

China turned out to be our biggest market by far, accounting for 46% of all sales. The credit goes entirely to our Chinese partner, Gamersky, who handled localization and regional distribution. They did outstanding work ‚Äî not just on the numbers, but on communication, responsiveness, and professionalism. Partnering with them was, without question, one of our best decisions. Our second-largest market was the U.S. at 16%, followed by Poland at 6%. That last figure might seem surprising, but we need to highlight that Act Zero is a Polish studio and the game is fully localized in Polish.

https://preview.redd.it/6omaspbvgjye1.jpg?width=703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f82551334205a9ef2a6b74f41bba86a3a5c67329

Looking at our daily sales chart, the pattern is clear: most purchases happen during Steam festivals or seasonal sales. Outside of those events, daily numbers drop sharply ‚Äî often to near-zero. As of now, our lifetime conversion rate sits at 10.7%, slightly below the Steam average.

We haven‚Äôt yet tested ultra-deep discounts (like -90%), which may still offer some upside. But for now, the game‚Äôs long tail is exactly what you'd expect from a niche, dialogue-heavy title without a major marketing push.

Initially, we had higher hopes. We believed 10,000 copies in the first year was a realistic target. But a mix of limited marketing, creative risks, and production compromises made that goal harder to reach. In the next section, we‚Äôll try to unpack what exactly went wrong ‚Äî and what we‚Äôd do differently next time.

# Mistakes & Lessons Learned

* **No Map or True Exploration**

*We. The Refugees* is a game about a journey from North Africa to Southern Europe ‚Äî yet ironically, the game lacks the feeling of freedom and movement that such a journey should evoke. The player follows a mostly linear, pre-scripted route with some branches along the way. The main route of the journey is more or less the same, although there are different ways of exploring specific sections of the route. Even a simple map with optional detours could‚Äôve dramatically improved immersion. Moving gameplay choices about the next destination onto such a map would also be highly recommended ‚Äî it would definitely liven up interactions on the left side of the screen, where illustrations are displayed. Clicking on them would simply offer a refreshing change from the usual dialogue choices shown beneath the text on the right side of the screen. After all, the ‚Äújourney‚Äù is a powerful narrative and gameplay topos ‚Äî one that many players find inherently engaging. Unfortunately, our game didn‚Äôt reflect this in its systems or structure.

* **Too Little Gameplay, Too Much Reading**

Players didn‚Äôt feel like they were actively participating ‚Äî and in a modern RPG or visual novel, interactivity is key. Introducing simple mechanics, like dice checks during major decisions or a basic quest log, would‚Äôve helped structure the action and add dramatic tension. These are familiar tools that players have come to expect, and we shouldn't have overlooked them.

* **Personality Traits with No Real Impact**

The player character had a set of personality traits, but they were largely cosmetic. Occasionally, a trait would unlock a unique dialogue option, but in practice, these had little to no impact on how the story unfolded. We missed a major opportunity here. Traits could have formed the backbone of a dice-based gameplay system, where they meaningfully influenced outcomes by providing bonuses or penalties to specific checks ‚Äî adding depth, variety, and replay value.

* **Mispositioned Pitch**

From the start, we positioned the game as a story about refugees ‚Äî a highly politicized topic that immediately turned away many potential players. Some assumed we were pushing propaganda. But our actual intent was far more nuanced: we tried to show the refugee issue from multiple perspectives, without preaching or moralizing ‚Äî trusting players to draw their own conclusions from the situations we presented.

Looking back, a better framing would‚Äôve been: a young journalist‚Äôs first investigative assignment ‚Äî which happens to deal with refugees. This would‚Äôve made the game far more approachable. The refugee theme could remain central, but framed as part of a broader, more relatable fantasy of becoming a journalist.

* **A Problematic Protagonist**

We aimed to create a non-heroic protagonist ‚Äî not a hardened war reporter, but an ordinary person, similar to the average player. Someone unprepared, naive, flawed. Our goal was to satirize the Western gaze, but many players found this portrayal alienating. It was hard to empathize with a character who often made dumb mistakes or revealed glaring ignorance.

The idea itself wasn‚Äôt bad ‚Äî challenging the ‚Äúcool protagonist‚Äù fantasy can be powerful ‚Äî but we executed it clumsily. We gave the main character too many flaws, to the point where satire and immersion clashed. A better approach might‚Äôve been to delegate those satirical traits to a companion character, letting the player avatar stay more neutral. As our CTO Maciej Sta≈Ñczyk put it:

*I still think a protagonist who‚Äôs unlikable at first isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad idea ‚Äî but you have to spell it out clearly, because players are used to stepping into the shoes of someone cool right away.*

* **A Static, Uninviting Prologue**

The game‚Äôs prologue begins with the protagonist sitting in his apartment, staring at a laptop (starting conditions exactly the same as the situation of our player right now!), moments before leaving for Africa. On paper, it seemed clever ‚Äî metatextual, symbolic. In practice, it was static and uninvolving. Many players dropped the game during this segment.

Ironically, the very next scene ‚Äî set in Africa ‚Äî was widely praised as engaging and atmospheric. In hindsight, we should‚Äôve opened in medias res, grabbing the player‚Äôs attention from the first few minutes. Again, Maciej Sta≈Ñczyk summed it up well:

*The prologue is well-written and nicely sets up the character, but players expect a hook in the first few minutes ‚Äî like starting the story right in the middle of the action.*

* **No Saving Option**

The decision to disable saving at any moment during gameplay turned out to be a mistake. Our intention was to emphasize the weight of each choice and discourage save scumming. However, in practice, it became a frustrating limitation‚Äîespecially for our most dedicated and engaged players, who wanted to explore different narrative branches but were repeatedly forced to replay large portions of the game.

* **Late and Weak Marketing**

We started marketing way too late. We had no budget for professionals and little expertise ourselves. We tried to learn on the fly, but lacked time, resources, and experience. What we could have done better was involve the community much earlier. As Maciej Sta≈Ñczyk notes:

*Biggest lesson? Involve your community as early as possible. Traditional marketing only works if you‚Äôve got at least a AA+ budget. Indies have to be loud and visible online from the earliest stages ‚Äî like the guy behind Roadwarden, whose posts I saw years before launch.*



**Final Thoughts on Mistakes**

If we were to start this project all over again, two priorities would guide our design: more interactive gameplay and freedom to explore the journey via a world map. Both would significantly increase immersion and player engagement.

Could we have achieved that with the budget we had? Probably not. But that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that now we know better ‚Äî and we intend to apply those lessons to our next project.



# Closing Thoughts

Two years after launch, we‚Äôre proud of how [We. The Refugees](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/) has been received. The game holds an 83% positive rating on Steam and has earned nominations and awards at several international festivals. We won Games for Good Award at IndieX in Portugal, received a nomination to Best in Civics Award at Games for Change in New York, and another to Aware Game Awards at BLON in Lithuania. For a debut indie title built on a shoestring budget, that‚Äôs not nothing.

We‚Äôre also proud of the final product itself. Despite some narrative missteps, we believe the writing holds up ‚Äî both in terms of quality and relevance. As the years go by, the game may even gain value as a historical snapshot of a particular state of mind. The story ends just as the COVID-19 lockdowns begin ‚Äî a moment that, in hindsight, marked the end of a certain era. In the five years since, history has accelerated. The comfortable notion of the ‚ÄúEnd of History‚Äù (to borrow from Fukuyama) ‚Äî so common in Western discourse ‚Äî has given way to a harsher, more conflict-driven reality. In that context, our protagonist might be seen as a portrait of a fading worldview. A symbol of the mindset that once shaped liberal Western optimism, now slipping into obsolescence. And perhaps that alone is reason enough for the game to remain interesting in the years to come ‚Äî as a kind of time capsule, a record of a specific cultural moment.

This reflection also marks the closing of a chapter for our studio. While we still have a few surprises in store for *We. The Refugees*, our attention has already shifted to what lies ahead. We‚Äôre now putting the finishing touches on the prototype for *Venus Rave* ‚Äî a sci-fi RPG with a much stronger gameplay core (which, let‚Äôs be honest, wasn‚Äôt hard to improve given how minimal gameplay was in *We. The Refugees*). The next phase of development still lacks a secured budget, but thanks to everything we‚Äôve learned on our first project, we‚Äôre walking into this one better prepared ‚Äî and determined not to repeat the same mistakes.

Whether we get to make that next game depends on whether someone out there believes in us enough to invest. Because, to be completely honest, the revenue from our first title won‚Äôt be enough to fund another one on its own.",1,1746266365.0,actzerogames,0,1.0,False

The Refugees* video game was somewhere in the range of $70,000‚Äì$80,000.

The production timeline stretched from May 2020 to May 2023 ‚Äî three full years. That‚Äôs a long time for an indie game of this size, but the reasons were clear:

First, the script was enormous ‚Äî around 300,000 words, or roughly two-thirds the length of The *Witcher 3*‚Äôs narrative. Writing alone took nearly 20 months.

Second, the budget didn‚Äôt allow for a full-time team. We relied on freelance contracts, which meant most contributors worked part-time, often on evenings and weekends. That slowed us down ‚Äî but it also gave us access to talented professionals from major studios, who wouldn‚Äôt have been available under a traditional staffing model.

We built the game in the Godot engine, mainly because it‚Äôs open-source and produces lightweight builds ‚Äî which we hoped would make future mobile ports easier (a plan that ultimately didn‚Äôt materialize). As our CTO and designer Maciej Sta≈Ñczyk put it:

*Technically speaking, Godot‚Äôs a solid tool ‚Äî but porting is a pain. For this project, I‚Äôd still choose it. But if you‚Äôre thinking beyond PC, you need to plan carefully.*

Over the course of production, around 15 people contributed in some capacity. Most worked on narrowly defined tasks ‚Äî like creating a few specific animations. About 10 were involved intermittently, while the core team consisted of about five people who carried the project forward. Of those, only one ‚Äî our CEO and lead writer Jƒôdrzej Napiecek ‚Äî worked on the game full-time. The rest balanced it with other jobs.

We ran the project entirely remotely. In hindsight, it was the only viable option. Renting a physical studio would‚Äôve burned through our budget in a matter of months. And for a game like this ‚Äî long on writing, short on gameplay mechanics ‚Äî full-time roles weren‚Äôt always necessary. A full-time programmer, for instance, would‚Äôve spent much of the project waiting for things to script. Given the constraints, we think the budget was spent as efficiently as possible.

# Marketing and Wishlists

For the first leg of the marketing campaign, we handled everything ourselves ‚Äî posting regularly on Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Between July and October 2022, those grassroots efforts brought in around 1,000 wishlists. Modest, but promising. During that period, we took part in Steam Next Fest ‚Äî a decision we later came to regret. Sure, our wishlist count doubled, but we were starting from such a low base that the absolute numbers were underwhelming. In hindsight, we would‚Äôve seen a much bigger impact if we had joined the event closer to launch, when our wishlist count was higher and the game had more visibility.

Then, in November 2022, our publisher came on board. Within just two days, our wishlist count jumped by 2,000. It looked impressive ‚Äî at first. They told us the spike came from mailing list campaigns. But when we dug into the data, we found something odd: the vast majority of those wishlists came from Russia. Actual sales in that region? Just a few dozen copies... We still don‚Äôt know what really happened ‚Äî whether it was a mailing list fluke, a bot issue, or something else entirely. But the numbers didn‚Äôt add up, and that initial spike never translated into meaningful engagement. You can see that spike here - it‚Äôs the biggest one:

https://preview.redd.it/xbntaknhgjye1.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fae8539ab26f571cb32b341af6c4b13771c588d9

From there, wishlist growth slowed. Over the next six months ‚Äî the lead-up to launch ‚Äî we added about 1,000 more wishlists. To put it bluntly: in four months of DIY marketing, we‚Äôd done about as well as the publisher did over half a year. Not exactly a glowing endorsement.

That said, the launch itself went reasonably well. The publisher managed to generate some nice visibility, generating about 50K visits on our Steam Page on the day of the premiere.

https://preview.redd.it/9ylqyrwigjye1.jpg?width=1265&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d6b504f540f2be9ca746c3b988ba5f9ec97b230

You can compare it to our lifetime results - we managed to gather 12.33 million impressions and 1,318,116 visits of our Steam Page during both marketing and sales phases:

https://preview.redd.it/9wrm1w2mgjye1.jpg?width=1243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94b16029f3948a06d6b0e0c61cba9d226331b6e6

It‚Äôs worth noting that nearly 50 titles launched on Steam the same day we did. Among them, we managed to climb to the #3 spot in terms of popularity. A small victory, sure ‚Äî but one that highlights just how fierce the competition is on the platform.¬†

Looking back, the launch may not have delivered blockbuster sales, but it did well enough to keep the game from vanishing into the depths of Steam‚Äôs archive. It‚Äôs still alive, still visible, and ‚Äî to our mild surprise ‚Äî still selling, if slowly.

After the premiere we saw a healthy bump: roughly 2,500 new wishlists in the month following release. By early June 2023, our total had climbed to around 6,300. After that, growth was slower but steady. We crossed the 10,000-wishlist mark in May 2024, a full year after launch. Since then, things have tapered off. Over the past twelve months, we‚Äôve added just 1,500 more wishlists. Here are our actual wishlist stats:

https://preview.redd.it/z6mfgzipgjye1.jpg?width=1127&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d0bd63c7471e5b3354f50246eb0d073139db8c

During the promotional period, we also visited many in-person events: EGX London, PAX East Boston, GDC San Francisco, BLON Klaipeda. We managed to obtain the budget for these trips - mostly - from additional grants for the international development of the company. And while these trips allowed us to establish interesting industry contacts, the impact on wish lists was negligible. In our experience - it is better to invest money in online marketing than to pay for expensive stands at fairs.

# Sales

Two years post-launch, We. The Refugees has sold 3,653 copies ‚Äî plus around 259 retail activations ‚Äî with 211 refunds. That‚Äôs a 5.8% refund rate, and an average of about five sales per day since release.

https://preview.redd.it/bbhzxzltgjye1.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53bc40d9b2bf6757bef350199926e8d5b484881a

China turned out to be our biggest market by far, accounting for 46% of all sales. The credit goes entirely to our Chinese partner, Gamersky, who handled localization and regional distribution. They did outstanding work ‚Äî not just on the numbers, but on communication, responsiveness, and professionalism. Partnering with them was, without question, one of our best decisions. Our second-largest market was the U.S. at 16%, followed by Poland at 6%. That last figure might seem surprising, but we need to highlight that Act Zero is a Polish studio and the game is fully localized in Polish.

https://preview.redd.it/6omaspbvgjye1.jpg?width=703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f82551334205a9ef2a6b74f41bba86a3a5c67329

Looking at our daily sales chart, the pattern is clear: most purchases happen during Steam festivals or seasonal sales. Outside of those events, daily numbers drop sharply ‚Äî often to near-zero. As of now, our lifetime conversion rate sits at 10.7%, slightly below the Steam average.

We haven‚Äôt yet tested ultra-deep discounts (like -90%), which may still offer some upside. But for now, the game‚Äôs long tail is exactly what you'd expect from a niche, dialogue-heavy title without a major marketing push.

Initially, we had higher hopes. We believed 10,000 copies in the first year was a realistic target. But a mix of limited marketing, creative risks, and production compromises made that goal harder to reach. In the next section, we‚Äôll try to unpack what exactly went wrong ‚Äî and what we‚Äôd do differently next time.

# Mistakes & Lessons Learned

* **No Map or True Exploration**

*We. The Refugees* is a game about a journey from North Africa to Southern Europe ‚Äî yet ironically, the game lacks the feeling of freedom and movement that such a journey should evoke. The player follows a mostly linear, pre-scripted route with some branches along the way. The main route of the journey is more or less the same, although there are different ways of exploring specific sections of the route. Even a simple map with optional detours could‚Äôve dramatically improved immersion. Moving gameplay choices about the next destination onto such a map would also be highly recommended ‚Äî it would definitely liven up interactions on the left side of the screen, where illustrations are displayed. Clicking on them would simply offer a refreshing change from the usual dialogue choices shown beneath the text on the right side of the screen. After all, the ‚Äújourney‚Äù is a powerful narrative and gameplay topos ‚Äî one that many players find inherently engaging. Unfortunately, our game didn‚Äôt reflect this in its systems or structure.

* **Too Little Gameplay, Too Much Reading**

Players didn‚Äôt feel like they were actively participating ‚Äî and in a modern RPG or visual novel, interactivity is key. Introducing simple mechanics, like dice checks during major decisions or a basic quest log, would‚Äôve helped structure the action and add dramatic tension. These are familiar tools that players have come to expect, and we shouldn't have overlooked them.

* **Personality Traits with No Real Impact**

The player character had a set of personality traits, but they were largely cosmetic. Occasionally, a trait would unlock a unique dialogue option, but in practice, these had little to no impact on how the story unfolded. We missed a major opportunity here. Traits could have formed the backbone of a dice-based gameplay system, where they meaningfully influenced outcomes by providing bonuses or penalties to specific checks ‚Äî adding depth, variety, and replay value.

* **Mispositioned Pitch**

From the start, we positioned the game as a story about refugees ‚Äî a highly politicized topic that immediately turned away many potential players. Some assumed we were pushing propaganda. But our actual intent was far more nuanced: we tried to show the refugee issue from multiple perspectives, without preaching or moralizing ‚Äî trusting players to draw their own conclusions from the situations we presented.

Looking back, a better framing would‚Äôve been: a young journalist‚Äôs first investigative assignment ‚Äî which happens to deal with refugees. This would‚Äôve made the game far more approachable. The refugee theme could remain central, but framed as part of a broader, more relatable fantasy of becoming a journalist.

* **A Problematic Protagonist**

We aimed to create a non-heroic protagonist ‚Äî not a hardened war reporter, but an ordinary person, similar to the average player. Someone unprepared, naive, flawed. Our goal was to satirize the Western gaze, but many players found this portrayal alienating. It was hard to empathize with a character who often made dumb mistakes or revealed glaring ignorance.

The idea itself wasn‚Äôt bad ‚Äî challenging the ‚Äúcool protagonist‚Äù fantasy can be powerful ‚Äî but we executed it clumsily. We gave the main character too many flaws, to the point where satire and immersion clashed. A better approach might‚Äôve been to delegate those satirical traits to a companion character, letting the player avatar stay more neutral. As our CTO Maciej Sta≈Ñczyk put it:

*I still think a protagonist who‚Äôs unlikable at first isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad idea ‚Äî but you have to spell it out clearly, because players are used to stepping into the shoes of someone cool right away.*

* **A Static, Uninviting Prologue**

The game‚Äôs prologue begins with the protagonist sitting in his apartment, staring at a laptop (starting conditions exactly the same as the situation of our player right now!), moments before leaving for Africa. On paper, it seemed clever ‚Äî metatextual, symbolic. In practice, it was static and uninvolving. Many players dropped the game during this segment.

Ironically, the very next scene ‚Äî set in Africa ‚Äî was widely praised as engaging and atmospheric. In hindsight, we should‚Äôve opened in medias res, grabbing the player‚Äôs attention from the first few minutes. Again, Maciej Sta≈Ñczyk summed it up well:

*The prologue is well-written and nicely sets up the character, but players expect a hook in the first few minutes ‚Äî like starting the story right in the middle of the action.*

* **No Saving Option**

The decision to disable saving at any moment during gameplay turned out to be a mistake. Our intention was to emphasize the weight of each choice and discourage save scumming. However, in practice, it became a frustrating limitation‚Äîespecially for our most dedicated and engaged players, who wanted to explore different narrative branches but were repeatedly forced to replay large portions of the game.

* **Late and Weak Marketing**

We started marketing way too late. We had no budget for professionals and little expertise ourselves. We tried to learn on the fly, but lacked time, resources, and experience. What we could have done better was involve the community much earlier. As Maciej Sta≈Ñczyk notes:

*Biggest lesson? Involve your community as early as possible. Traditional marketing only works if you‚Äôve got at least a AA+ budget. Indies have to be loud and visible online from the earliest stages ‚Äî like the guy behind Roadwarden, whose posts I saw years before launch.*



**Final Thoughts on Mistakes**

If we were to start this project all over again, two priorities would guide our design: more interactive gameplay and freedom to explore the journey via a world map. Both would significantly increase immersion and player engagement.

Could we have achieved that with the budget we had? Probably not. But that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that now we know better ‚Äî and we intend to apply those lessons to our next project.



# Closing Thoughts

Two years after launch, we‚Äôre proud of how [We. The Refugees](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/) has been received. The game holds an 83% positive rating on Steam and has earned nominations and awards at several international festivals. We won Games for Good Award at IndieX in Portugal, received a nomination to Best in Civics Award at Games for Change in New York, and another to Aware Game Awards at BLON in Lithuania. For a debut indie title built on a shoestring budget, that‚Äôs not nothing.

We‚Äôre also proud of the final product itself. Despite some narrative missteps, we believe the writing holds up ‚Äî both in terms of quality and relevance. As the years go by, the game may even gain value as a historical snapshot of a particular state of mind. The story ends just as the COVID-19 lockdowns begin ‚Äî a moment that, in hindsight, marked the end of a certain era. In the five years since, history has accelerated. The comfortable notion of the ‚ÄúEnd of History‚Äù (to borrow from Fukuyama) ‚Äî so common in Western discourse ‚Äî has given way to a harsher, more conflict-driven reality. In that context, our protagonist might be seen as a portrait of a fading worldview. A symbol of the mindset that once shaped liberal Western optimism, now slipping into obsolescence. And perhaps that alone is reason enough for the game to remain interesting in the years to come ‚Äî as a kind of time capsule, a record of a specific cultural moment.

This reflection also marks the closing of a chapter for our studio. While we still have a few surprises in store for *We. The Refugees*, our attention has already shifted to what lies ahead. We‚Äôre now putting the finishing touches on the prototype for *Venus Rave* ‚Äî a sci-fi RPG with a much stronger gameplay core (which, let‚Äôs be honest, wasn‚Äôt hard to improve given how minimal gameplay was in *We. The Refugees*). The next phase of development still lacks a secured budget, but thanks to everything we‚Äôve learned on our first project, we‚Äôre walking into this one better prepared ‚Äî and determined not to repeat the same mistakes.

Whether we get to make that next game depends on whether someone out there believes in us enough to invest. Because, to be completely honest, the revenue from our first title won‚Äôt be enough to fund another one on its own.",1,1746266356.0,textgames,0,1.0,False

- nausea leads to vomiting at times
- initially my left hand was going numb with a lot of pain which lead to the diagnosis of a pinched nerve I took pregablin for 3 months and physiotherapy sessions it was better but it wasnt gone and it would eventually get worse.
- now both my hands and feet go numb
- I had severe bone pain and insomnia last year doctors said it was vitamin d and b12, after taking my dose it was better
- now I have bone and joint pain, the pain is so severe its hard to walk, and the pain comes in random spells I'm fine for a while and boom sharp excruciating pain

I feel really helpless as my tests are clear and somehow nothing is wrong with me but I can feel my health declining. I was really active before all of this and now simple tasks have become difficult, walking seems hard getting up from the bed feels like a chore my body feels 10 times heavier. I am easily bruised and I have practically no strength in my body.
The doctors said they can't rule out anything at the moment and all I can do is wait. It's really frustrating when ik I'm not well i feel like crap but I have nothing to show for it as to why I feel that way. Love to whoever feels the same way and I hope either we get better or get our correct diagnosis ü©∑.",1,1746265721.0,DiagnoseMe,0,1.0,False
1kdp9nu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kdp9nu,And here we go‚Ä¶,"Hi folks, I‚Äôm just getting started on my journey. I had my first dose on the 1st of May and been watching my calorie intake since the 28th of April when I weighed in at 122kg. I felt a bit fatigued the day after my first dose and had a really bad headache despite drinking loads of water/electrolytes but I think this was more down to going completely cold turkey and not having my usual morning coffee or a Coke Zero throughout the day, for fear of exacerbating any potential sides. I feel completely normal today so that‚Äôs a good sign, the scales have moved a bit but I‚Äôm sure this is just water weight - hoping to see some great progress in the coming weeks.

A bit of history about me, I lost 10st/63kg back in 2011 by watching my diet and training 2-3 hours a day 6 days a week doing martial arts and CrossFit. I managed to keep the weight off for a few years but after getting a job in IT and being glued to my desk, I gradually put some of it back on. During COVID I was the heaviest I had been in years, but with a friend of mine I set up a home gym and we trained together every day. He sadly passed away very suddenly and it completely derailed me for quite a long time. 

I‚Äôve gone back and forth with my gym membership the last couple of years, making a good run of it but then getting disheartened and demotivated by still carrying so much weight and comparing my fitness to what it used to be, becoming a father and juggling that with work made it very difficult to stick to any kind of fitness routine. I worked with a nutritionist toward the end of 2023 and by February last year I had lost around 3 stone but had another bereavement in the family which knocked me back once again. 

I‚Äôve had a change in role recently with my company that offers me more flexibility and I‚Äôm getting out to the gym 3 mornings a week for the 5.30am sessions, and am really hoping Mounjaro compliment my training and boost weight loss with a view to tapering off once I‚Äôve reached my goal weight and maintain it with a healthy lifestyle and relationship with food. I‚Äôm hoping to reach around 90-95kg and see how I feel - any BMI calculators I‚Äôve used have said my healthy range for my height (185cm) should be from 63-80 but as shown in my before and after pictures attached, I was 88kg and feel I was too skinny - people were telling me I looked sick.

I will post future updates here - hoping this will keep me accountable! Appreciate advice you might have from your own experiences. Cheers!

Told the concierge team to toss it unopened.,"I‚Äôm almost certain it will say ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù as we said our farewells yesterday. A polite goodbye via video that was crystal clear and devastatingly sad but somehow also calm and almost mature for the first time I have known her.  As usually one of us is acting like a child so yesterday was strangely responsible of both of us. She is a sweet and kind person and there is a reason why I liked her so much so I‚Äôm not surprised about this sort of kind gesture. 


But I‚Äôd prefer to not know if it said anything. If she wants to get back together. She will call any of the million of numbers/apps that I use or go about it in a normal way. The cake won‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI changed my mind!‚Äù  So no matter what it says or any card or even if it is blank, it will certainly not be a good thing for me.  


And last night I threw away out every last ounce of anything she ever touched or liked or ate, used or wore. Slippers are gone. Ice cream she liked that I got her had to go.  The obvious toothbrush and stuff was first. But my favorite hoodie is no more. Anything that could potential smell like her that I can‚Äôt bleach, fabreze or baking sofa and vinegar the smell away had to go also. My place is now sanitized of all things that could trigger me. I allowed myself to be wasteful this one time cause‚Ä¶ well just cause. 


I really gave it my best shot. I poured my heart out this past week and nothing came of it. It was the first time I saw her with legitimately no emotion on her face while we were talking. Usually it is happiness or anger, sadness or excitement, just something. But this time. Nothing. I knew that was the dagger. I woke up today pretending that she never existed and while I know  I can‚Äôt keep the ruse up for long and I‚Äôll be a mess on and off for the next half year probably. It was nice to wake up and not be sad that she wasn‚Äôt beside me. I swapped the order of my entire morning routine and didn‚Äôt have to pack a lunch or make coffee or write a note. I liked all of that but by imagining that she never existed, I didn‚Äôt lie in bed weeping for an hour as I‚Äôve done all week.


Anyhow I may regret not accepting the cake in 5 years but it is a bit like Schr√∂dingers whole thing. The negative message doesn‚Äôt exist or could be positive since no one but her ever knew what it said and I didn‚Äôt open it. The hope, which I am really trying to overcome. The hope that exists still will be gone if I open the cake and look so it will remain alive  since I don‚Äôt know what it said. If I am still curious in 2 or 3 years I‚Äôll just ask her. By then I think I will be able to handle a message or two. For now. So ‚Äúgoodbye cake!‚Äù to a cake that likely says goodbye üòÇ


I told the staff to not accept any packages for me for a while.  I may miss an Amazon thing or two but just being notified that ‚Äú[her name] dropped off a cake would you like us to bring it up?‚Äù resulted in 45 mins of hysterical crying in a fetal position on my very hard floor. Wow it hurt telling them to throw it out though. On that 0.1% chance it said I love you or something. But that is 1 in 10,000 and the other 9,999 possibilities will make it worse.

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs advice I need or if I just straight need to hear something from another point of view or just deal with it. 

Yesterday evening (Thursday) I went on a date with someone I met off of hinge, we‚Äôve been talking since February sometimes a little bit off and on because she‚Äôs been travelling and I‚Äôve also been working a lot plus there‚Äôs a bit of distance between us (9 hour drive) but a little while ago she insisted we finally meet in person since talking since February. I made a trip and drove 9 hours on my days off so I could come see her. The date I thought went really well we went out for coffee, I missed her birthday a few weeks prior due to work but but her some belated presents, got flowers, dressed casually nice. The date went on for about 8 hours, we talked at the coffee shop patio for awhile, we went for a walk and she invited me into her apartment so she could put her flowers in water and put away her presents I got her (she seemed really excited and happy with what I got her) after we went for another walk to a near by restaurant and I took her and paid the bill for some food, appies and some cocktails. Everything seemed like it was going great (atleast from my point of view in my mind). There weren‚Äôt really any silent breaks in our convos , we chatted about everything getting to know each other, she talked about her family, jobs, school, laughed about past memories and chatted about friends we‚Äôve had. I really thought it was a mutual connection especially after talking for nearly 3 months. I walked her back home and gave her a hug and she asked me to text her when I got back to where I was staying (hotel) and asked if I wanted her to wait till I got my uber but I didn‚Äôt want to keep her waiting. I got an uber back to my hotel and texted her right when I got home safe. Told her ‚Äúhey I had a great time and I hope you also had a great time‚Äù mentioned how I really appreciated her talking the time to see me and everything. 

I don‚Äôt get it, it‚Äôs been Thursday since I texted and I haven‚Äôt even heard a reply or anything. I feel so stupid honestly for taking all this time to plan out presents, flowers and lining it up with my days off. It‚Äôs really disappointing because it‚Äôs been a year since I broke up out of a serious long term relationship with someone and wanted to get back out there and felt like this was a serious connection that would work out. But I haven‚Äôt heard a thing‚Ä¶ at the end of the day I guess it‚Äôs my own fault. I guess I should accept that maybe this it wasn‚Äôt as seemed and I always try to look at both perspectives and read the room of things. But I really thought she had a good time we were laughing about stories and memories, sharing personal details about ourselves and families, plans for our futures and with what‚Äôs presently going on and in the mid of conversations to seem like we really understood each other. I just don‚Äôt get it. 

I even would have accepted and been 100% cool with a message saying ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm not sure if we were compatible after tonight‚Äù but I just didn‚Äôt even hear anything. I don‚Äôt even know what to think and it stressed my brain just thinking about it all. Am I thinking about this too much? Maybe something I‚Äôm not thinking about? Am I just stupid? Should I keep waiting for a reply?  

Anyway if you read through this thank you, I just feel so confused and I don‚Äôt even know what to think right now. Any advice would be appreciated.

Hey MaximizeMe fam! üôå

Ever feel like you're stuck in an endless sea of meetings? You know, the kind where you‚Äôre nodding along, pretending to be engaged, while internally you‚Äôre screaming, ‚ÄúWhy am I here?‚Äù üò© Well, I recently discovered a little gem of wisdom that transformed my scheduling game: the **10-Second Rule**. And let me tell you, it works wonders!

Picture this: You‚Äôre in a meeting, and the clock is ticking. The agenda‚Äôs gone off the rails, and you start wondering how many emails you could've knocked out instead. Here‚Äôs the deal‚Äîbefore you dive back in and spend hours of your life in back-to-back meetings, take just **10 seconds** to evaluate whether your presence is truly needed. 

Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Pause for a sec**: When someone is setting the agenda or diving in deep, just take a moment to ask yourself, *‚ÄúAm I actually contributing here?‚Äù*

2. **The 2-Filter Test**: Ask yourself:
   - **Is this meeting relevant to my role?**
   - **Can I catch up on this later through notes?**

3. **If it doesn‚Äôt pass**: Politely bow out! Seriously, people! It‚Äôs okay to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pass this time.‚Äù Your time is precious, **treat it that way!** üåü

I remember my friend *Jess*‚Äîshe used to run to every meeting, coffee in hand, and came out feeling more exhausted than empowered. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è But one day, she implemented the 10-Second Rule. Now, she skips around 50% of meetings and has time to actually focus on her projects. Talk about a glow-up! ‚ú®

**Here‚Äôs the kicker**: This isn‚Äôt just about us being busy; it‚Äôs about working smarter. It‚Äôs about having energy left for the stuff that actually matters, like brainstorming your next big idea, or spending time on that passion project you've been neglecting. 

A few of the perks Jess noticed after embracing the rule:

- **Increased productivity**: Imagine all those hours turned back into actual work time!
- **Better mental clarity**: Less meeting fatigue means more creativity. üß†
- **Stronger boundaries**: You start to feel more in control of your calendar. 

So, the next time you find yourself pausing to contemplate the meaning of your meeting existence, remember: **10 seconds can save your sanity!** ‚è≥

Before I wrap up this little motivational nugget, think about your own scheduling habits. Are you riding the meeting treadmill and feeling exhausted? Maybe it‚Äôs time to hop off and reclaim those lost minutes. 

Let‚Äôs be real‚Äîwhat‚Äôs your favorite trick to manage your time better? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts! üòä",1,1746265230.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I know all our bodies are different and everyone has different feelings and experiences but here comes mine, 

!Warning some parts might be TMI!

After TTC for about 1 year my period was late and I decided to do a test which to my big surprise came back positive. This if after months of getting so disappointed when my period comes, months of negative tests and months of tracking ovulation days and checking my temperature. 

About 3 days after my first positive test I really had to use the bathroom, my belly was cramping and when I finally got to the toilet I felt like a stab in my stomach and when I wiped there was brown discharge, my first thought was miscarriage. 

I booked an appointment with my OBGYN to tell her about whats happening and he ordered hcg tests and ultrasound. The hcg levels increased, not really doubling but increased and nothing was seen on the ultrasound, I should have been about 5w at this point. This whole week I was having brown discharge, some bleeding with small cloths, some weird purple discharge and also what looked like coffee grounds coming out of my vagina. My Dr didn‚Äôt seem to worried, told me as long as its increasing its good! And I got another appointment about 10 days later.

I kept doing hcg bloodtests and the level kept increasing but never double. 

At that appointment I was supposed to be 7w but the ultrasound showed nothing, nowhere, anywhere. And Dr said probably early miscarriage and I was asked to do another hcg bloodtest that came back way higher than 10 days ealier so now Ectopic pregnancy was most likely. 

More ultrasounds and still nothing found anywhere so it was a total mindfuck. And Dr recommended MTX shot since my hcg was only around 2000. I decided to get a 2nd opinion and finally it was found in my left tube a yolk sac, and this ultrasound HURT while the Dr was trying to locate it. I decided to go for the MTX shot since I didn‚Äôt want surgery but after reading here Im thinking maybe I should have. 

I was given a 85mg shot 2 days ago and waiting for something to happen. First of all I was sore where the shot was and then got super gassy. My belly keeps gurgling and Im passing so much gas and burping.Then I got a headache and felt nauseous. Im also experiencing some diarrhea but I had that before the shot too because of the stress I assume. But thats about it, no spotting or bleeding and no cramps other than because of the gas a diarrhea and Im now worried the shot didn‚Äôt work. 

Im scheduled for bloodtest in 2 days and another one 3 days later, so lets see what‚Äôs happening.

In honestly annoyed at my doctor for not explaining to me that its a looong process to get the hcg levels down to 0. She made it sound like it was just a shot and then its gone! Never explained that it can take several weeks..",1,1746265028.0,EctopicSupportGroup,0,1.0,False

I got an uber back to my hotel and texted her right when I got home safe. Told her ‚Äúhey I had a great time and I hope you also had a great time‚Äù mentioned how I really appreciated her talking the time to see me and everything. 

I don‚Äôt get it, it‚Äôs been Thursday since I texted and I haven‚Äôt even heard a reply or anything. I feel so stupid honestly for taking all this time to plan out presents, flowers and lining it up with my days off. It‚Äôs really disappointing because it‚Äôs been a year since I broke up out of a serious long term relationship with someone and wanted to get back out there and felt like this was a serious connection that would work out. But I haven‚Äôt heard a thing‚Ä¶ at the end of the day I guess it‚Äôs my own fault. I guess I should accept that maybe this it wasn‚Äôt as seemed and I always try to look at both perspectives and read the room of things. But I really thought she had a good time we were laughing about stories and memories, sharing personal details about ourselves and families, plans for our futures and with what‚Äôs presently going on and in the mid of conversations to seem like we really understood each other. I just don‚Äôt get it. 

I even would have accepted and been 100% cool with a message saying ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm not sure if we were compatible after tonight‚Äù but I just didn‚Äôt even hear anything. I don‚Äôt even know what to think and it stressed my brain just thinking about it all. Am I thinking about this too much? Maybe something I‚Äôm not thinking about? Am I just stupid? Should I keep waiting for a reply?  

Anyway if you read through this thank you, I just feel so confused and I don‚Äôt even know what to think right now. Any advice would be appreciated. It‚Äôs currently 3:30 AM Saturday where I live and I can‚Äôt even sleep dwelling on this. I see her on Instagram being online all the time and I just don‚Äôt understand this situation.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The Effectiveness of an ice machine water filter hinges on several critical features that dictate its performance and suitability for various applications.

**Filtration Capacity:** The total volume of water a filter can effectively process before requiring replacement is a key factor.

A Higher capacity translates to fewer filter changes and reduced maintenance costs over time. Commercial ice machines, which consume large volumes of water, benefit significantly from filters with capacities of 10,000 gallons or more. Residential users may find filters with capacities of 2,500 to 5,000 gallons adequate for their needs. This capacity is directly related to the filter's ability to maintain consistent water quality and prevent premature clogging.

**Micron Rating:** This measurement indicates the size of particles the filter can effectively remove.

A Lower micron rating signifies a finer filter capable of capturing smaller contaminants. For ice machines, a micron rating of 5 or lower is generally recommended to remove sediment, rust, and other particulate matter that can affect ice clarity and machine performance. Some advanced filters offer sub-micron filtration for even greater purity, targeting bacteria and other microorganisms. The micron rating plays a critical role in protecting the ice machine's internal components from damage caused by abrasive particles.

**Chemical Reduction Capabilities:** The filter's ability to reduce chlorine, chloramine, and other chemicals that affect taste and odor.

Chlorine and chloramine, commonly used in municipal water supplies, can impart unpleasant tastes and odors to ice. An Effective filter should incorporate activated carbon or other media capable of absorbing these chemicals, resulting in cleaner-tasting and more appealing ice. Some filters also target lead, mercury, and other heavy metals that may be present in the water supply. Chemical reduction is essential for ensuring the ice meets quality standards and provides a refreshing experience for consumers.

**Flow Rate:** The speed at which water passes through the filter, measured in gallons per minute (GPM).

An Adequate flow rate is crucial for maintaining consistent ice production. A Filter that restricts water flow can slow down the ice-making process and reduce the machine's overall efficiency. Commercial ice machines typically require higher flow rates than residential models, so selecting a filter with an appropriate GPM rating is essential. The flow rate should be compatible with the ice machine's specifications to ensure optimal performance and prevent damage to the pump or other components.

**Filter Housing Material:** The durability and resistance to corrosion of the filter housing.

The Housing material should be made from food-grade, BPA-free plastic or stainless steel to ensure water safety and prevent contamination. A Robust housing is essential for withstanding water pressure and temperature fluctuations without cracking or leaking. Stainless steel housings offer superior durability and resistance to corrosion, making them ideal for demanding commercial environments. The housing material should also be easy to clean and maintain to prevent the growth of bacteria or mold.

**Certifications:** Independent verification of the filter's performance and safety by organizations such as NSF International.

Nsf certifications indicate that the filter has been tested and meets rigorous standards for contaminant reduction, material safety, and structural integrity. Look for filters certified under NSF/ANSI Standard 42 for aesthetic effects (chlorine, taste, and odor) and NSF/ANSI Standard 53 for health effects (lead, cysts, and other harmful contaminants). Certifications provide assurance that the filter will perform as claimed and protect the health of consumers.

 ## Core Benefits

Using a high-quality ice machine water filter offers several key benefits that extend beyond just improving the taste of ice.

**Improved Ice Quality:** By removing impurities, sediments, and chemicals, the filter ensures the ice is clear, odorless, and free from unpleasant tastes.

Clear, Clean ice enhances the overall drinking experience and is particularly important for businesses serving beverages to customers. Filtered water also freezes more evenly, resulting in harder, longer-lasting ice cubes that don't melt as quickly. This is important in maintaining cold drinks for a longer amount of time without excessive ice melting.

**Extended Ice Machine Lifespan:** The filter prevents scale buildup and corrosion within the ice machine, protecting its internal components from damage.

Scale Buildup, caused by minerals in the water, can clog water lines and damage the evaporator plate, leading to costly repairs or premature failure of the ice machine. By removing these minerals, the filter helps maintain the machine's efficiency and extends its lifespan. This reduction in maintenance leads to both time and money being saved.

**Reduced Maintenance Costs:** With cleaner water flowing through the ice machine, there is less need for frequent cleaning and descaling.

This Reduction in maintenance translates to lower labor costs and less downtime for businesses. A Well-maintained ice machine also operates more efficiently, consuming less energy and reducing utility bills. This preventative measure will save businesses and homeowners money in the long run.

**Enhanced Hygiene:** Some filters are designed to remove bacteria and other microorganisms, ensuring the ice is safe for consumption.

This Is particularly important in commercial settings where hygiene standards are paramount. Filters with sub-micron filtration capabilities can effectively remove harmful pathogens, providing an extra layer of protection for customers. Clean ice is essential for maintaining a healthy environment and preventing the spread of waterborne illnesses.

**Better Tasting Drinks:** Filtered water improves the taste of beverages, making them more refreshing and enjoyable.

This Improvement is especially noticeable in drinks like iced tea, coffee, and cocktails, where the flavor of the ice can significantly impact the overall taste. Clean Ice enhances the flavor profile of the beverage rather than detracting from it.

1kdoxap,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1kdoxap/at_first_i_was_just_pretending_then_crazy_stuff/,"At First, I Was Just Pretending ... Then Crazy Stuff Started Happening","When she died at 60 in early 2017, I immediately realized there was no ""moving on"" or going forward without her. My wife was, and is, EVERYTHING to me. Might not be healthy, some might call it a psychological problem, that might be true but it didn't matter to me. The only way forward was *with* her. ""Without her"" was nothing but an endless, barren, dark wasteland of pain, despair and suffering. For me, it was not an option.

So, I made the decision that I would just *pretend* she was still with me.  ""Dead,"" sure, but still ""alive"" as a ghost that lived with me, and would stay with me the rest of my life until we were reunited at some point.  I would still pour her coffee in the morning, sit on the porch and pretend to light her cigarette while we enjoyed our usual banter and discussions. I imagined her smiling and laughing. We talked about our new situation, with her as a ghost, and how much fun we could have with that.

I talked to her out loud all the time - even when I (we) were out doing things in public, like grocery shopping or running other errands. When I cried I told her not to worry, I'd get used to our new situation and that pain would go away eventually. I would imagine her saying ""It's okay, lover, I'm right here with  you and I'm not going anywhere.""  Every now and then, while I was talking to her about something a little sarcastic comment would pop in my head and make me laugh out loud, because it was just like her to say something like that.

We talked about and planned what our life would be like after we were reunited. We made [vision boards on Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/wjmurray910/) where we would put images of what we wanted in our future together. When I went to sleep at night, I wrapped my arms around a big pillow and pretended it was her as I whispered my words of love and commitment to her, and told her over and over how much she means to me.

Over time, the pain subsided and I started enjoying our new relationship and found great comfort and happiness in it. Didn't really matter to me if it was ""real"" or not. It was fun and fulfilling. It *felt* like we were continuing forward. Plus, I wasn't hurting anyone or demanding that they behave as if she was still alive. It was kind of like us living in our own secret world together, but I did find some people online who were doing the same thing, or wanted to.

One night, in a very intense and long-lasting dream, my wife appeared and showed me our home in the afterlife. It was a big mountain lodge with an amazing view of snow-capped mountains. She gave me a tour of the place, My vision was exceptionally sharp and I could see all this amazing detail. When I woke up I wrote this down in my blog and in a couple of FB groups, and specifically used the term ""mountain lodge.""

Later that day I turned on the TV and turned it to the channel to watch Wheel of Fortune with her, but I was a few minutes late and paused it immediately, but it was after the first puzzle where Pat was interviewing contestants. I was disappointed and apologized to her that we missed the first puzzle. I quickly made dinner while the TV was paused (DISH service.) When I came back in the room the TV show was not paused where I had paused it, on Pat's interviews; it looked to be on a commercial. I unpaused it, and after the commercial ended the beginning of the show started, which should have been impossible.

One of the solutions to a puzzle in that show was ""Mountain Lodge."" My mind was completely blown.

Crazy stuff like that started going on regularly, often with other people around to witness them. Things I needed at the time would just appear out of nowhere - actual, physical objects that other people saw and touched. Drawings were appearing daily in her coffee, some of the most complex and detailed stuff that no Starbuck's barista could ever produce. [I've got pictures.](https://www.redstringsociety.com/post/stunning-new-image-in-her-coffee) One time, I was on the road driving home and I was talking to Irene, my ""ghost"" wife, about the ""radiant flowers"" she was drawing in her coffee every day. At that moment a box truck pulled in front of me from a side road, and on the back of the truck a big sign was painted that read ""Irene's Flowers.""

Could it all be a self-induced delusion? A lot of crazy coincidences? It's possible, but I don't really care. I function in this world just fine, I'm not hurting anyone, and I honestly enjoy this - whatever it is - immensely.",5,1746264193.0,widowers,1,1.0,False

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. üôÇ

## What is Finarixis?

Finarixis is an **automated trading platform** that uses algorithms to analyze market data and execute trades on your behalf. Kind of like having a really smart assistant that doesn‚Äôt sleep or get emotional over losing trades.

It‚Äôs designed for both **newbies and seasoned traders**, offering a clean, intuitive UI and features like real-time analytics, multiple trading options, and customizable alerts. What makes it stand out is how it blends automation with user control. You can let it run on autopilot, or you can tweak strategies manually.

The platform supports various financial markets including **cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and even commodities**. So whether you're into Bitcoin or gold, there's something here for you.

## Who Created Finarixis?

Details on the team behind Finarixis are a bit scarce‚Äîjust like most platforms in this space. But from what I‚Äôve gathered, it seems like it was developed by a group of fintech professionals and crypto enthusiasts who wanted to make trading **more accessible and less stressful** for everyday users.

This is pretty standard in the world of automated trading apps. Even platforms like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge don‚Äôt list every founder, but they‚Äôve managed to gain trust through performance and user experience. Same vibe here with Finarixis.

Would I love a LinkedIn page or at least a ‚ÄúMeet the Team‚Äù section? Sure. But lack of public founders isn‚Äôt necessarily a red flag‚Äîit just means we need to judge the platform by its features and user feedback.

## How Does Finarixis Work?

Finarixis uses **AI-driven algorithms** to scan the markets, look for trading opportunities, and execute trades based on pre-set parameters. Think of it like Google Maps for your money‚Äîit checks the data and tells you the best route (or trade) to take.

Once you create an account and deposit funds, you can either:
- Use **automated trading**, where the algorithm trades for you.
- Go **manual** and place your own trades using the platform's insights.
- Or mix both, depending on how hands-on you want to be.

What‚Äôs cool is that it offers real-time analysis, customizable alerts, and access to multiple markets, all in one place. You don‚Äôt need to juggle five apps anymore.

1kdosok,https://www.reddit.com/r/OverexplainedEmotions/comments/1kdosok/ntricate_dance_of_minor_annoyance_and_its_bodily/,ntricate Dance of Minor Annoyance and Its Bodily Impact,"In an unexpected and dramatic sequence of events this morning, a singular, minor event‚Äînamely, encountering a locked coffee canister‚Äîprecipitated a fascinating cascade of emotional and physiological responses, which I feel compelled to dissect. Allow me to delineate this rather mundane emotional reaction in intricate detail.

Phase 1: Recognition and Initial Cognitive Assessment. Upon the tactile feedback of an unyielding lid, my neural centers rapidly signaled a secondary cognition process, originating in the pre-frontal cortex, which is informally referred to as 'annoyance'. The mind swiftly oscillated between rational solutions and exasperation at the unexpected barrier.

Phase 2: The Emotional Engram Formation. Here, a sensory feedback loop activated, emphasizing the tactile resistance of the lid, akin to a microcosm of life's larger impediments. A sense of 'minor irritation', subtype: Pre-Caffeination Stress, took form. This phase was critically triggered by a procedural memory lapse of not checking the canister‚Äôs lock status the night prior.

Phase 3: Physiological Manifestation. An imperceptible increase in cardiac output correlates with an uptick in systemic frustration levels. Simultaneously, a subtle yet specific tingling sensation migrated towards the frontal regions of the dermis on my forehead, suggestive of a slight elevation in sweat gland activity.

Upon retrospection, the complex orchestration of this incident offers a compelling glimpse into the minutiae of the human emotional landscape. While this deconstruction may seem overextended for a non-event, the curiosities of daily emotional turbulence warrant such acute analytical indulgence. Frankly, the human emotional spectrum, even in its benign fluctuations, holds an undeniable allure when viewed under a lens of absurd yet entertaining scrutiny.",1,1746263629.0,OverexplainedEmotions,0,1.0,False
1kdorjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiaustralia/comments/1kdorjq/saving_money_on_caffeinecoffee_during_high_cost/,Saving money on caffeine/coffee during high cost of living - what worked for me,"Like many Australians, I cannot go without coffee daily. But the prices keep going up - some say up to $7-8 by the end of this year.

I'm currently working, trying to reach myFAT FIRE goal, and with my expenses for coffee totalling around $4.5K per year, I figured it was worth looking at cheaper alternatives to fulfil my caffeine requirements.

I first tried caffeine pills. While they are a cheap way to hit my 150-200mg daily caffeine intake, I did feel nauseous even after using them for 2 weeks. I figured it was the faster absorption, coupled with taking it while on an empty stomach. So I tried having a small breakfast before consuming the pills and still felt the same.

Last month, I stumbled across caffeine pouches, which are only a bit pricier than pills but are flavoured and discreet (no one could tell I had one tucked in my mouth). The slower oral absorption also meant that I didn't feel nauseous and anxious. Rather, it's like sucking on candy except there are 0 calories and no sugar!

Anyways, I thought I would share this with the community as it may help some people reach their FIRE goal just a bit faster. I currently get mine from this website called [www.pouchmax.com](http://www.pouchmax.com), who seem to be the cheapest in Australia.

I am happy to hear what other alternative options people recommend.

Here are the calculations for the expected savings I should achieve this year - $3.9K (not too shabby in this high cost of living environment!)

Note: I usually drink 2 cups of coffee, which is about 150-200mg of caffeine. I use the pouches that have 100mg of caffeine in each pouch, so I need 2 a day.

I‚Äôve labelled myself queer and am a babygay I guess (with all those feels of confusion, fraud, homecoming, ‚Ä¶).

I am a cis woman and so far I mostly dated men and only had relationships with men. Looking at them in hindsight, the ‚Äúmain emotions‚Äù were being with a companion or liking their personality or more their interests and the platonic things we could to together. Sexually I don‚Äôt know if I was attracted; I remember telling a friend that I didn‚Äôt like men‚Äôs bodies or rather they don‚Äôt turn me on. I told another friend that I only start to be interested in men when I had a physical encounter already and before I don‚Äôt really assume them to be attractive or interesting usually, just from their appearance). But then I can also get pleasure, but with penetration it was more the giving and intimacy that stood out for me - not a physical pull or idk it was more like a trade: sexual pleasure for him and intimacy for me). I also had a lot of crushes on men, that mostly were obsessive and fantasising a lot (I do have adhd too). And I experienced the dopamine rushes from these mind games.

Anyway. What the confusing part for me is, that I started dating a woman for 2 month right after when some guy dumped me, and I was questioning before and she was in some kind of chasing phase. But I shut down eventually, being overwhelmed with the pace. It still cracked open a gate for me to explore my sexuality more. So two happenings stood out for me, that made me realise I am queer at least.

The first is my first crush on a woman when I was ~21. I didn‚Äôt explore these feelings and she was more of an acquaintance that I only saw sometimes. But even then I thought to myself, that if I‚Äôd be some kind of sapphic, I would fall for her. I was just stunned. It‚Äôs like when I saw her the world turned more slowly. Then with ~26 I encountered her again by accident. I acted as if I don‚Äôt know her because I didn‚Äôt know if she‚Äôd remember me. When she left (I was a barista and she was ordering), I was wondering if everyone else felt the electricity from my body and how the world literally stopped turning for me while she was present and ordering her coffee to go.

When I was changing my workplace with 28., another crush literally hit me. She is my coworker and the  first time I saw her fr the world stopped again, and I couldn‚Äôt take my eyes off of her, still trying to play it cool cause it is work. I was always nervous around her, couldn‚Äôt even speak, or was blushing, so I was avoiding encounters with her and used my more imaginative crush to do good work and looking forward to come to work. Anyway we started working more closely together and I hoped my crush would fade once I get to know her and find out that we don‚Äôt really align. Turns out it didn‚Äôt happen and we lowkey have a vibe (but she has a bf and is my coworker). So platonic feelings started growing for her as I admire her personality. This helps me to have my crush in check that sometimes just creeps up on me, like, she was leaning in SO CLOSE (or was it just me?) to whisper something in my ear for such a bit too long amount of time. I literally froze. I catched her smell which ingrained itself in my body. One time (this is so embarrassing) I catched her bad breath lol and it wasn‚Äôt disgusting, but my senses heightened again and I was more like curious. This never happened to me before. With the last boyfriend I had, I didn‚Äôt even like his smell (esp. his head/hair..). I could imagine myself romantically and physically with women. With men I usually imagined some kind of emotional intimacy especially with cuddling and stuff. With women I can imagine more other physical stuff (which i can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt do with men). Idk. I also feel like the potential of emotional intimacy with a men made me compromise on their behaviour and my desire that wasn‚Äôt really physically but I don‚Äôt consider myself asexually. Like I don‚Äôt even like beards and am more drawn to soft/femme presenting men.

So: am I bi-cycling? I wouldn‚Äôt rule out being attracted to a guy in the future under very specific circumstances. But at the same time I don‚Äôt know if I can feel towards men what I feel towards women (like this bodily pull and abundance of admiration) because I only let myself discover it now.

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

## What is Quantum Kelidium?

Quantum Kelidium is an **automated trading platform** that uses **AI algorithms** to analyze market data and execute trades on your behalf. The idea is simple: instead of spending hours glued to charts, you let the software do the work. It tracks price movements, scans for patterns, and places trades when the conditions are right.

It‚Äôs kind of like having a smart assistant who doesn‚Äôt need sleep or coffee‚Äîjust data and a solid internet connection. It supports multiple asset classes including **cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum**, as well as **forex, commodities, and even stocks.**

The platform claims to be beginner-friendly while still offering enough tools and customization for intermediate users.

## Who Created Quantum Kelidium?

The exact names behind Quantum Kelidium haven‚Äôt been made public, which is pretty common in the world of trading bots. But from what I could gather, it appears to have been developed by a team of **financial analysts, software engineers, and AI experts**‚Äîa mix that makes sense for a platform of this kind.

It also partners with **regulated brokers**, which adds a layer of legitimacy. Think of it like the bot being your GPS, but the broker is the car you‚Äôre driving.

While anonymous teams can be a red flag, this isn‚Äôt unusual for platforms that rely on proprietary trading strategies. Still, I do wish there was a little more transparency here.

### [üî• Start Trading with Quantum Kelidium Today](https://is.gd/CoX2i1)
## How Does Quantum Kelidium Work?

Quantum Kelidium uses **machine learning** and **real-time data analysis** to scan markets and predict potential trading opportunities. The algorithm looks at everything from news headlines to technical indicators, and then suggests or executes trades based on the parameters you set.

Here‚Äôs how the flow generally works:

- You create an account and deposit a minimum of $250.
- The platform connects you to a **partner broker**.
- You can choose to trade manually or let the bot execute trades for you.
- The AI continuously scans the market and adjusts strategies as needed.

It‚Äôs not magic‚Äîbut it is advanced math and computing power doing what humans simply can‚Äôt do fast enough.

## Quantum Kelidium Pros and Cons

Let‚Äôs keep it real. No platform is perfect. Here's a breakdown of the good and the not-so-great:

1kdokng,https://i.redd.it/j95gv0r24jye1.jpeg,"That's what I do, I drink coffee and know things.","When I was young, just starting out in my first ""career"" job, there was an old guy who sat in the smoking room *all day*, reading the paper and smoking a pipe.  He knew *everything,* every part of the job and the business.  It took me a while to realise that had become his job.  Everyone from the bosses to the most junior tech would go to him throughout the day and ask questions or for advice.    Sometimes about the job, sometimes about personal issues.  He would always treat each person equally and seriously.  

You don't see this kind of thing anymore, because as people get older, they get pushed out of jobs.  There hasn't been a ""job for life"" for decades.  And because we prioritise having the latest information, we lose *knowledge*.

Fast-forward to the other day when I complained to a co-worker that I was having trouble keeping up with my own work that day with all the people asking me questions.  Later on, my manager asked me for help on something and then joked that I'm never allowed to leave or she'll have to get my mobile number.  And then it hit me.  Between having worked in lots of different fields, having a really varied education, and having been a union rep, I've picked up a lot of knowledge, relatively speaking, and I like sharing it.  So for some people I guess I've become that old guy.  And that is a tradition I'm happy to uphold as best I can.  Which cheered me up almost enough to stop me complaining.

1kdojro,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1kdojro/help_first_day_on_elvanse_was_brutal/,Help! First day on Elvanse was brutal!,"48M here recently diagnosed with Inattentive ADHD. Yesterday, I took my first dose of Elvanse (30mg). I took it at 10am which was later than planned but I had spent much of the morning trying to read up how best to take it. I ate a late breakfast just beforehand. ¬†

Here is a breakdown of my experience. I kept a video diary for myself and checked in about once an hour. I could really use some help from the community to make sense of it, because I am wondering if I really want to take another pill and go through this again today! ¬†

\- 2hrs - For the first two hours I felt pretty much nothing - I took a long time to take effect.¬†i had eaten breakfast shortly before taking it so this presumably affected how fast the medication was absorbed.

\- 2.5hrs - I began to feel a little anxious. Like I had had one too many cups of coffee. (I did have a coffee in the morning but it was decaf as my psychiatrist had warned me to do off coffee during titration.). Not entirely pleasant but bearable. I didn't notice much of a difference in my ability to focus. Slight dry mouth.

\- 3hrs - Began to feel very anxious. Like severely over-caffeinated. Felt very edgy and couldn't easily focus on stuff. Felt ill at ease. Shoulders were tense. It didn't feel good. I found i was talking more. I forced myself to eat lunch but it was a real struggle. Food was very unappealing.

\- 4hrs - I was now feeling extremely anxious, restless and strung out. Very unpleasant feeling. I was slightly slurring my words. It reminded my of that feeling when you have done a bit too much cocaine (at least how cocaine was for me back when i used to take it). I found myself pacing. My body felt really weird with the left side of my body feeling different to the right. My right arm felt weird - sort of numb and tingly. (This is really hard to explain!). I found it hard to stay seated if i tried to work - i was anxious, restless, could not concentrate, could not focus. I just paced, waiting for it to subside. I didn't feel right in myself.

\- 5hrs - I tried to sit and do some admin I have been putting off - sending an invoice to a client - but found it really hard to concentrate. I was just extremely anxious and restless. I felt clammy, and was slightly sweating. I went for a walk outside to try and wait for it to pass. I also had this feeling where the right side of my body felt different to the left. (Hard to explain!) I found it very hard to see any perceived benefits to the medication, it was all side effects.

\- 6hrs - After the walk I went and lay down for a bit, and to my amazement i actually fell asleep for a little bit (maybe 15 minutes). I never imagined I would have been able to sleep at that moment but i did. When i awoke the anxiety had begun to diminish a bit, but i still found it difficult to make myself do stuff. I seemed to have the same executive function challenges that I do normally. I felt very disillusioned by the whole experience, and was disappointed that i only had negative side effects without seeing any benefits. It did not seem to help me focus.

Over the next hour the anxious, restless feeling slowly disappeared and i basically felt normal for the rest of the day as if the pills had worn off. This seemed strange to me as the pills are meant to last 12 hours or so and i would say i was back to normal within 8 hours. There was no crash. I felt fine, and had no trouble sleeping in the evening.

It is now the following morning. I wanted to write this last night but did not have the mental capacity to write it then. I have had to make a decision over whether to take another pill today. Has anyone else had a first experience like this? Does it get better?

I have not heard back from my psychiatrist yet who i rang yesterday (they're crazy busy!) but I really wanted to find out if this reaction is common. Invevitable, because it did not seem to help, it makes all the negative self-talk come up, and i start to think that maybe I don't have ADHD after all because of the extreme reaction to the drugs. (For the record both my nephews were diagnosed last year which is what started this journey for me.)

Did anyone else have this reaction to Elvance/Vynvanse on their first try? Is it worth persevering? Did you find that you body gets used to the medication?",2,1746262550.0,VyvanseADHD,5,1.0,False

I wish I could find a place where I belong,"Looking at my user flair should give you an idea about my views. Now let's come to the actual discussion.

Our beliefs, our faiths, our views might be different but I don‚Äôt see progressive Muslims as my enemies. The way I see it, I can stir up a respectful friendly discussion with a progressive Muslim with a cup of coffee. You don't believe that someone should be killed for leaving Islam, you want a society where people won‚Äôt have to live in fear for losing their faith in Islam. And I appreciate you for that. You also speak up against extremist, radical and ultra conservative interpretations of Islam, you criticize them.

I have watched the friendly discussions between [Dr Shabir Ally and Veedu Vidz](https://youtu.be/ogSsTv_-P8c) on the punishment of blasphemy. [Veedu invited Mufti Abu Layth to his house and they had over 2 hours long discussion, while sitting side by side and laughing](https://youtu.be/l5LHdyHESz0). [Veedu later came to a live on MALM's channel](https://www.youtube.com/live/SJk8INJqTC0). [He had friendly discussions with other exmuslims too](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y6sh-0zeTzU). Abdullah Sameer shared a [video](https://youtu.be/ks8zg_XLM5w) of Mufti Abu Layth on his channel where he was talking against the punishment of apostasy. And that's all I wish to see in my lifetime, tolerance from both sides.

I have immense respect for scholars like Dr Shabir Ally and Mufti Abu Layth. Even on exmuslim subreddit [when some other exmuslims were falsely accusing Dr Shabir Ally of supporting slavery, I spoke out](https://old.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/198ajf3/dr_shabir_ally_says_wearing_hijab_isnt_mandatory/ki5wyt2/?context=3). I [praised him](https://old.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/11l5i4m/canadian_imam_dr_shabir_ally_fearlessly/) on other occasions, defended him in the comments.

Now the sad part
-

I have received hateful messages from some exmuslims for not being against progressives. One example is [this post of mine](https://old.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/164lncb/as_an_exmuslim_myself_i_absolutely_hate_how_some/) which I wrote after someone uploaded an edited clip of Dr Shabir Ally, portraying him as a slavery apologist. Check the comments. I also got bullied by some for having pro Palestine stance on other occasions.

Recently I asked a question on the r/jafari subreddit which is supposedly run by a progressive twelver shia. I asked a simple question about what the extend of awrah is according to his understanding and he just saw my profile and [became judgemental](https://old.reddit.com/r/Jafari/comments/1k5fk3m/if_headscarf_isnt_mandatory_then_what_is_the/mor2h2n/?context=3). In [another reply](https://old.reddit.com/r/Jafari/comments/1k5fk3m/if_headscarf_isnt_mandatory_then_what_is_the/moqefec/?context=3) he called me jahil.

On this progressive Islam subreddit, I have received some hateful messages from for my user flair. Last time it was from a Quranist and after that I disabled my user flair until today. You can go check my profile, I have never mocked the Prophet or Allah or anything. In fact I don‚Äôt even openly criticize Islam. Yet he called me an Islamophobe and wrote bad things in the reply because my user flair. After that I deleted my comtent (so can't link that comment here, sorry).

*(Also I peeked into some Quran only groups and backtracked immediately, the amount of hatred they harboured isn't much different from the extremist Salafists and Taliban. It's surprising how the progressive Sunnis and Shias here are way more tolerant and friendly. Shouldn‚Äôt it have been the opposite since Quranists reject hadiths altogether?)*

I'm not saying everyone is like this, in fact there are a lot of friendly exmuslims in the exmuslim subreddit too (you can see their comments if you check some of the links above), and friendly people in this place as well. But there are many who are hostile. In the progressive Muslim circle for some reason a lot of those judgemental hostile people happen to be Quranists while progressive Sunnis and Shias surprisingly turn out to be more friendly. In the exmuslim circles most of the judgemental bullies happen to be the pro Israel ones who for some reason hate progressive Muslims way more than extremists. Both groups can't tolerate people like me üòÖ.

Because of this nowadays I rarely participate on reddit. I don't know where I belong. 

* I Wish there could have been a place where we all could have friendly discussions without all the aggression, judgement and name callings. Like how Mufti Abu Layth and Dr Shabir Ally had friendly conversations with Veedu Vidz and other exmuslims. 

* I Wish more exmuslims were tolerant of progressive Muslims and understood that progressive Muslims genuinely want a society where exmuslims won't be harmed for their beliefs. Wish more exmuslims understood that progressive Muslims genuinely hate extremists like Taliban & reject the ultra conservative interpretations and not some liars giving shelters to extremists in the west (as some exmuslims compare extremist Muslims with snakes and progressive Muslims with the grass hiding the snakes). 

* Wish more progressive Muslims understood that many exmuslims appreciate their efforts of building a better & tolerant society.

* In the end, I wish both groups understood that many progressive Muslims and exmuslims face very similar oppression and at times even persecution from conservative Muslims (read about Sheikh Hassan Farhan Al Maliki, Nasr Abu Zayd, Javed Ahmed Ghamidi) and therefore could relate to one another's experiences to some extent at least.

But I guess in the polarized world we live in today, that is too much to ask for.

1kdoffn,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kdoffn/the_ledger_tree/,The Ledger Tree,"Mae Wilson should have known better than to believe in small-town rumors. She was seventeen‚Äîold enough to know that whispered stories passed down through generations were bullshit. But she was also desperate, and desperation makes fools of us all.

The Ledger Tree stood alone on the outskirts of Millhaven, a small farming town where everyone knew your business before you did. The oak had been dead for as long as anyone could remember. Its twisted branches reached up like arthritic fingers, bark blackened and peeling off in places to reveal the pale wood beneath.

Mae had heard about it all her life. A fucking fairy tale. Carve a name into the tree, and that person vanishes. Poof. Gone. Not dead‚Äîworse than dead. Erased. As if they'd never existed at all.

Only you would remember them.

What a load of crap.

But here she was anyway, trudging through the patchy undergrowth, dried leaves crunching beneath her worn-out sneakers as the autumn wind whipped her long brown hair across her face. The forest smelled of decay and coming rain. Her fingers tightened around the handle of the pocketknife in her jacket‚Äîthe one she'd stolen from her brother Jason's room that morning.

Jason. The reason she was here at all.

Last night had been the worst one yet. Mom working the night shift at the hospital as usual, Dad long gone to who-knows-where. Just Mae and her older brother in the house. He'd been drinking again. Started with the usual shit‚Äîcalling her names, criticizing everything about her. Ended with her locked in the bathroom, a bruise forming on her cheek, while he pounded on the door, screaming about how she'd ""disrespected"" him.

Mae touched her face, wincing at the tender spot beneath her eye. She'd covered it with makeup before school, but she knew people had noticed. They always noticed in Millhaven. They just never said anything.

She spotted the tree standing in a clearing up ahead, exactly as the stories described. Taller than the other trees, isolated, as if even the forest didn't want anything to do with it. As she got closer, she could see the names‚Äîhundreds of them‚Äîcarved into every available inch of its trunk.

Old names, new names. Some shallow, barely scratching the surface. Others dug deep, like whoever carved them wanted to make damn sure they took.

*This is so stupid*, she thought, even as she stood before the tree, knife clutched in her sweaty palm. *I'm actually going to do this.*

Mae flicked open the blade. The metal caught the late afternoon sunlight, glinting sharply. She pressed the tip to a smooth patch of bark near the bottom of the trunk, just above a cluster of other names.

""J-A-S-O-N W-I-L-S-O-N,"" she carved, each letter deep and deliberate. The wood was surprisingly soft, giving way easily to the blade.

There. Done.

Mae stepped back, wiping sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand. She felt nothing except the slight embarrassment of having believed, even for a moment, that this would work. The forest was quiet except for the distant call of birds and the rustle of leaves in the wind.

""Fucking waste of time,"" she muttered, pocketing the knife and turning away from the tree. She'd deal with Jason the same way she always did‚Äîstaying out of his way, locking her door at night, counting the days until graduation when she could finally leave this town behind.

It started raining on her walk home, a light drizzle that quickly turned into a downpour. By the time Mae reached her house, she was soaked to the skin and shivering. She paused at the front door, bracing herself for whatever mood Jason would be in.

She pushed the door open slowly, listening.

Silence.

""Hello?"" Mae called out, stepping inside and dripping water onto the worn linoleum. ""Jason?""

No answer.

Relief washed over her. He must be out with his friends. She headed to the bathroom, stripping off her wet clothes and stepping into a hot shower. As the water pounded against her back, she thought about what she'd done. The stupidity of it. The desperation.

*It's just a tree. Just a stupid tree and a stupid story. Nothing's going to happen.*

She toweled off and dressed in clean clothes, then headed to the kitchen to make dinner. Mom would be home around 11 PM, exhausted from her shift. Mae wanted to have something ready for her.

As she chopped vegetables for a stir-fry, she glanced at the clock. 7:30 PM. Usually, Jason would be home by now, demanding to know what was for dinner, complaining that she wasn't doing it right.

By 9 PM, dinner was ready, and still no Jason. Mae ate alone at the kitchen table, scrolling through her phone. No texts from him, which was weird. Despite everything, he was usually good about letting Mom know if he wasn't coming home.

At 11:15 PM, the front door opened, and Mae's mom trudged in, still wearing her nurse's scrubs, her face lined with exhaustion.

""Hey, honey,"" she said, dropping her bag on the counter. ""Sorry I'm late. Is there any dinner left?""

""Yeah, I saved you a plate,"" Mae said, getting up to reheat it in the microwave. ""How was work?""

""Same old chaos,"" her mom sighed, kicking off her shoes. ""Where's‚Äî"" She stopped, a small furrow appearing between her brows. ""Did you eat already?""

Mae nodded slowly. ""Yeah... a couple hours ago.""

Her mom smiled, the furrow disappearing. ""Well, it's sweet of you to wait up for me.""

Mae handed her the plate of reheated stir-fry, a strange uneasiness settling in her stomach. ""Mom, where's Jason?""

Her mother looked up from her food, fork halfway to her mouth. ""Who?""

The fork slipped from Mae's fingers, clattering against the linoleum floor.

""Jason,"" Mae repeated, her voice barely above a whisper. ""My brother. Your son.""

Her mother's face changed, concern replacing confusion. ""Honey, are you feeling okay? You don't have a brother. It's just been you and me since your dad left.""

Mae's legs gave out, and she sank into a chair, her heart hammering against her ribs. ""That's not... you don't remember Jason? Twenty years old, works at the garage, drinks too much? He's lived here his whole life.""

Her mother set down her fork and pressed a cool hand to Mae's forehead. ""You don't have a fever... Did something happen at school today? You look upset.""

Mae pulled away from her touch. ""I'm fine,"" she said automatically. ""Just... tired. I'm going to bed.""

""Okay, sweetie. Thanks for dinner.""

Mae fled to her room, shutting the door behind her. She leaned against it, struggling to breathe as panic clawed at her throat.

*It worked. It actually fucking worked.*

Jason was gone. Not just gone‚Äîhe'd never existed. His room‚Äîshe had to check his room.

Mae crept down the hallway, past her mother who was now watching TV in the living room. She turned the handle of what had been Jason's bedroom door and pushed it open.

A storage room. Boxes stacked against the walls. Old Christmas decorations. Mom's sewing machine. Not a trace of Jason‚Äîno clothes, no posters, no empty beer cans. Nothing.

She backed out of the room, closing the door quietly. Back in her own room, Mae sat on the edge of her bed, staring at her trembling hands.

*I erased my brother. I erased my fucking brother.*

She should feel guilty. Horrified. Instead, all she felt was relief‚Äîsweet, overwhelming relief. No more walking on eggshells. No more bruises to hide. No more fear.

Mae slept better that night than she had in years.

---

The next few weeks were... peaceful. Mae couldn't remember the last time home had felt safe. She stopped flinching at sudden movements. Stopped rushing to her room the moment she got home from school. Started inviting friends over.

Her grades improved. She laughed more. Even her mom noticed the change.

""You seem happier lately,"" she said one evening as they washed dishes together after dinner. ""Is there something you're not telling me? A boy, perhaps?""

Mae smiled, shaking her head. ""No, nothing like that. I just feel... lighter, I guess.""

And she did. With Jason gone, erased from existence, it was as if a weight had been lifted from her shoulders. Sometimes guilt pricked at her‚Äînot for what she'd done, but for not feeling bad about it. He'd been horrible, yes, but erasing someone from reality... wasn't that worse?

But those moments were fleeting. Mostly, Mae was happy. For the first time in years, she was happy.

Until she started seeing them.

It began three weeks after Jason vanished. Mae was walking home from her after-school job at the local diner, cutting through the park as the streetlights flickered on in the early evening darkness. She glanced up and saw someone standing beneath a large oak tree about fifty yards away.

A tall figure, motionless. Watching her.

Mae squinted, trying to make out details in the gathering dusk. The figure seemed... wrong somehow. Like there was something off about its proportions, though she couldn't put her finger on what.

""Hello?"" she called, her voice sounding small in the empty park.

The figure didn't move. Didn't respond. Just stood there, watching.

An uncomfortable prickling sensation crawled up Mae's spine. She quickened her pace, no longer cutting across the grass but sticking to the lit path. When she glanced back, the figure was gone.

*Just someone out for a walk*, she told herself. *Or a trick of the light.*

But two days later, she saw it again. This time from her bedroom window‚Äîa figure standing at the edge of their backyard, half-hidden by shadows. And the night after that, on her way home from a friend's house, she spotted it across the street, standing perfectly still beneath a burned-out streetlight.

Each time, the figure vanished when she tried to get a better look. Each time, it seemed to be watching her.

Mae began to wonder if she was losing her mind. Or if this was the price‚Äîthe cost of using the Ledger Tree. A haunting.

She resolved to ignore it. The figure never came close, never tried to approach her. Just watched from a distance. Mae could live with that if it meant Jason stayed gone.

But then Hal Thompson happened.

Hal was the owner of the diner where Mae worked. A sweaty, red-faced man in his fifties with wandering eyes and hands that found excuses to brush against the teenage girls who worked for him. Nothing obvious enough to report, nothing they could prove‚Äîjust enough to make them uncomfortable, to make their skin crawl.

Mae had been dealing with him for months, developing the usual tactics‚Äînever being alone with him, wearing baggier clothes for shifts, moving away when he got too close. But that Friday, he'd cornered her in the storage room while she was restocking napkins.

""You're doing a good job, Mae,"" he said, standing too close, his breathing slightly labored. ""Real good job. I'm thinking you deserve a raise.""

""Thanks,"" Mae said, keeping her eyes on the napkin dispensers she was filling, willing him to leave.

""'Course, money's tight these days. But maybe we could work something out."" His hand settled on her waist, thumb rubbing small circles against her uniform. ""Some... arrangement that works for both of us.""

Mae froze, her heart hammering. ""I need to get back to my tables,"" she managed to say, trying to step around him.

Hal moved to block her. ""Don't be like that, Mae. I'm trying to help you out here."" His hand slid lower. ""You're a smart girl. You know how things work.""

Mae shoved past him, knocking over a stack of napkins in her haste. She rushed back to the dining area, her face burning, hands shaking so badly she could barely carry her tray.

She quit at the end of her shift, ignoring Hal's protests and threats about ""references."" She didn't care. She couldn't go back there, couldn't be around him anymore.

That night, Mae found herself back at the Ledger Tree. The moon was full, casting eerie shadows across the clearing. The tree seemed more ominous now that she knew what it could do.

She took out her knife‚Äînot Jason's anymore, just hers now‚Äîand found a clear space on the trunk.

""H-A-L T-H-O-M-P-S-O-N,"" she carved, letters smaller this time but just as deep.

There. Let him see how he liked being erased.

Mae walked home, a strange calmness settling over her. She'd deal with finding a new job tomorrow. For now, she just wanted to sleep.

The next morning, at breakfast, her mom mentioned that the diner on Main Street was looking for waitstaff.

""Greasy Joe's?"" Mae asked, confused. ""That place has been closed for years.""

Her mom looked at her strangely. ""What? No, honey. Greasy Joe's has been there forever. You know, where you were talking about applying last week?""

Mae's spoon clattered against her cereal bowl. ""What about Thompson's Diner?""

""Thompson's?"" Her mom frowned. ""Don't think I've heard of that one. Is it new?""

Mae pushed away from the table, muttering something about being late for school. Outside, she broke into a run, heading straight for Main Street.

Where Thompson's Diner had stood for as long as Mae could remember, there was now a slightly run-down place called Greasy Joe's. Same building, different sign, different name. Inside, through the window, she could see an old man‚Äîpresumably Joe‚Äîwiping down the counter.

No sign of Hal. No one in town would remember him now.

Mae felt a hysterical laugh bubble up in her throat. She'd done it again. And it had worked again.

That evening, as Mae walked home from a friend's house, she saw not one but three figures watching her from different points along her route. Tall, motionless, faces obscured by shadow‚Äîor maybe they had no faces at all. She couldn't tell and didn't want to get close enough to find out.

She hurried home, locking the door behind her. When she glanced out her bedroom window before closing the curtains, she saw them‚Äîfive of them now‚Äîstanding at various points around her house. Watching. Waiting.

Mae slept with her light on that night.

The next few weeks brought more changes. Mae got a job at Greasy Joe's, which everyone insisted had been there for decades. Old Joe was gruff but fair, never leering, never touching. Mae found herself relaxing, enjoying the work.

But the watchers kept increasing in number. Every night, more of them appeared‚Äîstanding at the edge of the school parking lot, in the neighbors' yards, across the street from Greasy Joe's. Always watching her. Never approaching.

Mae started noticing other changes too. Subtle at first, then increasingly obvious. People in town seemed... different. Mrs. Lloyd at the corner store, who'd always been chatty, now barely spoke a word. Mr. Peterson, her English teacher, who'd been stern but kind, started giving harsh, unpredictable punishments for minor infractions.

It was as if parts of them had been... rewritten.

One day, Mae overheard two of her classmates talking about a party the previous weekend.

""And then Tyler got so wasted he tried to climb onto the roof‚Äî""

""Who's Tyler?"" Mae interrupted.

Both girls stared at her. ""Uh, Tyler Robinson? Quarterback? Dating Zoe Mitchell? Only been obsessed with him since freshman year?""

""Right,"" Mae said quickly. ""Sorry, brain fart.""

But she had no idea who Tyler Robinson was. Had never heard the name before. And yet, everyone else seemed to know him.

Was this another change? Someone new being... added?

The realization hit her like a physical blow. The Ledger Tree didn't just take people away. It replaced them with something else. The people she erased weren't just vanishing‚Äîthey were making room for... what? These faceless watchers?

Mae began to notice more newcomers. People everyone else recognized but who were strangers to her. A new teacher. A family that had ""always"" lived down the street. The friendly barista everyone loved at the coffee shop that had ""recently reopened"" after ""renovations.""

Each time, there were more watchers. Each time, the town felt a little less like home and a little more like... something else.

And then, exactly one month after she'd carved Hal's name, Mae dreamed of the tree.

In the dream, she stood before the Ledger Tree in the moonlight. Its trunk writhed with movement, as if the names carved into it were alive, squirming beneath the bark. Sap oozed from the cuts, thick and dark red, dripping down to pool at the base.

Mae looked down and realized she was holding her knife. Without conscious thought, her hand moved forward, pressing the blade to the bark. She began to carve, unable to stop herself.

When she finished and stepped back, she saw what she'd written:

""M-A-E W-I-L-S-O-N""

Her own name.

Mae woke with a gasp, sweat soaking her pajamas despite the cool night air coming through her open window.

*Just a dream. Just a fucking dream.*

But she couldn't shake the feeling of dread that clung to her like a second skin. She got dressed with shaking hands and headed out before dawn, feet carrying her automatically toward the forest.

She had to see. Had to know.

The Ledger Tree stood as it always had, twisted and dark against the lightening sky. Mae approached slowly, eyes scanning the trunk, looking for her name among the hundreds carved there.

At first, she saw nothing. Just the usual jumble of names, old and new, including Jason's and Hal's, exactly where she'd put them.

Then, near the top of the trunk, almost too high to reach, she spotted it. Faint but unmistakable: ""MAE WILSON.""

Her breath caught in her throat. She hadn't put that there. She hadn't carved her own name.

Which meant someone‚Äîor something‚Äîelse had.

Mae backed away from the tree, her shoes crunching on fallen leaves. She bumped into something solid and unyielding behind her. Something that hadn't been there seconds ago.

She whirled around and found herself face to face‚Äîor rather, face to no-face‚Äîwith one of the watchers.

Up close, it was worse than she'd imagined. The figure was tall, its proportions almost but not quite human. Where its face should have been was just... smooth blankness. No eyes, no mouth, no features of any kind. Just a void in the shape of a head.

Mae screamed, the sound tearing from her throat, raw and primal. She ran, crashing through the underbrush, branches whipping at her face. Behind her, she could hear movement‚Äînot footsteps, exactly, but a strange, slithering sound, as if something was dragging itself after her.

She burst out of the forest and onto the road, gasping for breath. No sign of pursuit. Just the empty early morning street stretching before her.

Mae walked home slowly, her mind racing. Her name was on the tree. She was marked for... what? Erasure? Replacement? How long did she have?

And who had carved it?

The answer came to her with sickening clarity. The watchers. The faceless things that had been gathering since Jason disappeared. They were using the tree too.

The knowledge settled in her gut like a stone. She'd started something. Opened a door. And now, whatever was on the other side was coming through.

When Mae reached her house, her mom's car was gone‚Äîearly shift at the hospital. She went inside, heading straight to the bathroom. The face that stared back at her from the mirror looked haggard, dark circles under wide, frightened eyes.

She had to fix this. Had to stop it somehow.

Mae spent the day researching‚Äîold town records at the library, local history books, even cornering Mrs. Abernathy, the town's oldest resident, for stories about the Ledger Tree. No one had any answers, just the same whispered legends she already knew. No one mentioned the watchers. No one seemed to notice them at all.

That evening, as dusk fell, Mae returned to the tree. The watchers lined her path through the forest, standing motionless among the trees, their blank faces turned toward her as she passed. She kept her eyes forward, refusing to look at them directly.

The Ledger Tree waited in its clearing, dark and patient. Mae approached it, knife in hand.

""I want to undo it,"" she said aloud, her voice sounding small in the vast silence of the forest. ""I want to take it back.""

The tree, of course, didn't answer. The watchers remained at the edge of the clearing, a ring of silent observers.

Mae pressed her knife to the bark and carved a single word: ""UNDO.""

Nothing happened. The forest remained still. The watchers didn't move.

""Please,"" Mae whispered, a tear sliding down her cheek. ""Please, I take it back. I don't want this anymore.""

Still nothing.

In frustration, Mae slashed at the tree, her knife cutting deep gouges in the bark. ""Give them back! Take this back!""

The knife slipped, slicing into her palm. Mae cried out, dropping the blade. Blood welled from the cut, dripping onto the exposed roots of the tree.

For a moment, she thought she felt a tremor run through the ground beneath her feet. The air seemed to thicken, pressure building in her ears.

Then nothing. Just the normal sounds of the forest at dusk.

Mae wrapped her bleeding hand in the hem of her shirt and picked up her knife. As she turned to leave, she noticed the watchers had drawn closer, their ring tightening around the clearing.

She pushed past them, ignoring the way her skin crawled when she brushed against their not-quite-solid forms. They made no move to stop her.

Back home, Mae bandaged her hand and sat on her bed, staring at the wall. What now? What the hell was she supposed to do now?

Over the next few days, Mae noticed more changes. People she'd known all her life started giving her strange looks, as if they couldn't quite place her. Mrs. Lloyd at the corner store asked if she was new in town. Her best friend since elementary school, Lily, took three rings to answer her call, then spoke with awkward formality, like they were distant acquaintances.

The town was forgetting her. Just as it had forgotten Jason and Hal.

At home, her mom still recognized her, still treated her normally. But at school, teachers began to frown when calling her name in attendance, as if surprised to find her on their roster. Classmates she'd known for years started introducing themselves as if they'd never met.

The watchers continued to multiply. They filled the spaces between houses, lined the roads, gathered in silent groups in parks and parking lots. No one else seemed to notice them.

And then, exactly one week after she'd found her name on the tree, Mae came home to find a stranger in her kitchen.

A woman with her mother's face but not her mother's expression looked up from making dinner, a polite smile on her lips. ""Can I help you?""

Mae's blood turned to ice. ""Mom? It's me. Mae.""

The woman's smile faltered slightly. ""I'm sorry, I think you have the wrong house. There's no Mae here.""

""This is my house,"" Mae insisted, panic rising in her throat. ""I live here. You're my mother.""

The woman's expression shifted from confusion to concern. ""Honey, I think you're confused. My daughter's name is Lily. She's at soccer practice right now.""

""Lily? No, Mom, Lily's my friend. I'm your daughter. Mae. Mae Wilson.""

The woman‚Äînot her mother anymore, not really‚Äîset down the spoon she was holding and took a step toward Mae, hands raised placatingly. ""I think you should leave now. Before my husband gets home.""

*Husband?* Mae's mind reeled. Her mother hadn't dated anyone since Dad left.

""Please,"" Mae whispered, tears streaming down her face. ""Please remember me.""

The woman's face hardened. ""Leave now, or I'm calling the police.""

Mae fled, stumbling out the front door and down the street. Where could she go? Who would remember her?

She tried Lily's house, but Lily's mother gave her the same confused, then suspicious look. ""Lily's not here. She lives with her father across town.""

House after house, person after person‚Äîno one recognized her. No one remembered Mae Wilson.

As night fell, Mae found herself back at the Ledger Tree. The watchers lined her path, more numerous than ever, but she barely noticed them now. What did it matter? Soon she'd be one of them.

The tree stood dark against the starry sky. Mae approached it without fear now‚Äîwhat was left to be afraid of?

She ran her fingers over the hundreds of names carved into the bark, wondering how many were like her‚Äîforgotten, erased, replaced. Had they all used the tree, only to end up carved into it themselves? Had they all thought they were getting what they wanted?

Her fingers found Jason's name, then Hal's. Then, higher up, her own. The carvings felt warm beneath her touch, almost alive.

""I'm sorry,"" she whispered, unsure who she was apologizing to. Jason? The town? Herself?

A twig snapped behind her. Mae turned to find a semicircle of watchers at the edge of the clearing, their blank faces turned toward her. In the center stood a figure that was almost, but not quite, like the others.

This one had the beginning of features‚Äîthe suggestion of eyes, the hint of a mouth. As Mae watched, the features shifted, becoming more defined, more... familiar.

It was forming a face. Her face.

Mae backed against the tree, her heart hammering against her ribs. This was it, then. Her replacement was ready.

The figure took a step forward, its movements jerky and unnatural, like a puppet with tangled strings. Its face‚Äîher face‚Äîwas still unfinished, details blurring and shifting, but unmistakably becoming Mae.

""No,"" Mae whispered, pressing herself against the rough bark of the tree. ""No, please.""

The figure continued its awkward approach. The other watchers remained at the edge of the clearing, silent observers to her replacement.

Mae's hand closed around something hard in her pocket‚Äîher knife. She pulled it out, brandishing it before her. ""Stay back!""

The figure paused, its half-formed face tilting in an approximation of curiosity. Then it continued forward, untroubled by the threat.

Mae slashed wildly at the air, forcing the thing to halt again. She felt the trunk of the Ledger Tree solid against her back, bark scraping through her thin shirt. An idea‚Äîdesperate, probably useless, but the only one she had‚Äîformed in her mind.

She turned and pressed the knife to the tree, quickly carving a new word beneath her own name:

""REMEMBER""

For a moment, nothing happened. The figure resumed its approach, now barely an arm's length away. Its face was almost complete now, a grotesque mirror of her own.

Then Mae felt it‚Äîa tremor running through the tree behind her, vibrating up through her fingertips. The bark beneath her hands began to warm, then burn. She tried to pull away, but her hands seemed fused to the trunk.

The clearing filled with a high, thin sound‚Äînot quite a scream, not quite a whistle. The watchers at the edge began to shudder, their forms blurring, stretching.

The figure with Mae's face stopped its advance, its features beginning to melt, running like wax down the blank canvas of its head.

Pain shot through Mae's body, radiating from her hands outward. She tried again to pull away from the tree, but she couldn't move. It felt as if something was flowing out of her, into the tree‚Äîor perhaps flowing from the tree, into her. She couldn't tell.

Images flashed through her mind‚ÄîJason, sneering, hand raised to strike her; Hal, sweaty and leering in the storage room; faces she didn't recognize, names she'd never heard. Hundreds of them, thousands, each one carved into the tree at some point, each one erased.

Remembered.

The high keening sound grew louder, filling the clearing, filling Mae's head until she thought her skull would split. The watchers' forms became more unstable, some collapsing entirely, others twisting into impossible shapes.

The figure with Mae's face was gone, nothing left but a shapeless mass on the ground.

Mae's vision began to darken at the edges. The pain was unbearable now, a white-hot current running through her veins. She was burning from the inside out.

*I'm dying*, she thought with strange clarity. *This is what it costs.*

As consciousness slipped away, Mae had one final thought: *At least they'll remember me.*

---

Mae Wilson died on a Tuesday, though no one found her body until Friday. A hiker discovered her at the base of an old oak tree in the forest outside Millhaven‚Äîa tree locals had long called the Ledger Tree, though no one could remember why.

The autopsy was inconclusive. Heart failure, they said, though unusual in someone so young. No signs of trauma besides some superficial cuts on her palms and strange burn-like marks on her fingertips.

The funeral was well-attended. Her mother, Linda Wilson, sobbed uncontrollably throughout the service. Her brother Jason, recently returned from a stint in rehab, stood stony-faced beside her, one hand awkwardly patting her shoulder.

Hal Thompson, owner of the local diner where Mae had worked, sent flowers but didn't attend‚Äîthere were rumors about him and young waitresses that made people uncomfortable.

Lily Parker, Mae's best friend since elementary school, gave a moving eulogy about their friendship, about Mae's kindness and quiet strength. About how she'd miss her every day.

Everyone agreed it was a tragedy. So young. So much potential. Such a shame.

No one mentioned the strange, faceless figures some claimed to have seen at the edge of the ceremony, watching from a distance. By evening, most had convinced themselves they'd imagined it‚Äîa trick of the light, or grief playing tricks on their minds.

And if, in the weeks that followed, people occasionally had moments of disorientation‚Äîbrief, unsettling periods where the world seemed slightly wrong, as if something had been added or taken away‚Äîwell, they didn't dwell on it. Life went on. People forgot.

Except for Jason Wilson. He started spending time at the Ledger Tree, drawn there by something he couldn't articulate. Sometimes, he could swear he heard his sister's voice whispering among the leaves, saying something he couldn't quite make out.

One day, examining the trunk, he noticed something carved near the base‚Äîa single word, etched deep into the bark:

""REMEMBER""

Below it, almost worn away, he could just make out what appeared to be other words, other names.

He traced them with his fingertips, feeling a strange warmth beneath the rough bark.

For a moment‚Äîjust a moment‚Äîhe thought he saw a figure standing at the edge of the clearing. A familiar silhouette. But when he turned to look directly at it, there was nothing there.

Just shadows, and the rustle of leaves in the wind.

Just memories, fading like names from an ancient ledger.

One thing I tried recently was adding¬†**Moringa**¬†to my mornings.

Honestly, I didn‚Äôt expect much. I‚Äôve fallen for enough overhyped ‚Äúsuperfoods‚Äù in the past to be cautious.

But this one surprised me.

# Why I Tried Moringa

I‚Äôd been feeling weirdly low-energy for a while ‚Äî sluggish in the morning, brain fog mid-day, and some minor joint stiffness that made me feel older than I am.

I started reading about¬†**Moringa oleifera**¬†‚Äî a plant known as the ""miracle tree"" ‚Äî and found that it's loaded with:

* Antioxidants
* Natural anti-inflammatory compounds
* More potassium than bananas
* More vitamin C than oranges
* Plus iron, amino acids, and other stuff that support gut health and energy

Seemed promising‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs all plant-based.

# What Happened

I used a powdered supplement every morning, mixed into water on an empty stomach. Nothing crazy ‚Äî just one scoop, first thing.

Here‚Äôs what changed after about a week:

* **Energy levels got way more stable**¬†‚Äî no coffee crashes
* **Digestion improved**¬†noticeably (less bloating, more regular)
* **Mental clarity**¬†got better ‚Äî not sure if that‚Äôs from nutrients or better gut health
* **Less inflammation**¬†in my knees (that was unexpected but welcome)

It didn‚Äôt feel like a ‚Äúspike‚Äù in energy ‚Äî more like a steady upgrade throughout the day.

# The Supplement I Used

There are tons of Moringa products out there, but I used one called¬†**Moringa Magic**¬†because it‚Äôs clean, has no fillers, and is reasonably priced.

If anyone wants to try the same one, here‚Äôs the link I used:  
üëâ¬†https :/ /www . digistore24 . com/redir/562310/mohammednageh411/

I‚Äôm not claiming this will fix everyone‚Äôs problems, but it worked better than I expected, especially for something so simple.

If anyone else has tried Moringa or found other small things that make a difference, I‚Äôd love to hear about it. I‚Äôm on a mission to upgrade without overhauling my life üòÇ",1,1746261882.0,u_mohammednageh61,0,1.0,False

## What is Nova Tradyx?

Nova Tradyx is a **multi-asset trading platform** that claims to use smart algorithms to help users make better trading decisions. Think of it as your digital assistant for buying low and selling high‚Äîexcept it doesn‚Äôt talk back or ask for coffee breaks.

It offers both **manual and automated trading**, which is great for people like me who sometimes want full control and other times just want to ‚Äúset it and forget it.‚Äù What‚Äôs cool is that it‚Äôs not just limited to crypto. You can also trade forex, stocks, and even some commodities. So it's more like a Swiss Army knife for traders.

## Who Created Nova Tradyx?

Honestly, this part is a bit vague. Nova Tradyx doesn‚Äôt make it super clear who exactly is behind the platform. It's likely developed by a team of traders and software engineers, probably with experience building similar platforms like **Bitcoin Era** or **Immediate Edge**.

While anonymity on the internet isn‚Äôt new (hello, Satoshi Nakamoto), it can be a little concerning when you‚Äôre trusting a platform with your money. That said, many platforms in this space operate in a similar way, focusing more on features and performance than founder branding.

### [üî• Start Trading with Nova Tradyx Today](https://t.co/P5zP1aB7Wr)
## How Does Nova Tradyx Work?

Nova Tradyx uses a **combination of algorithms and real-time market data** to identify trading opportunities. You can choose to trade manually or activate the **automated trading bot**, which executes trades based on preset parameters.

The platform scans market conditions 24/7 and uses customizable signals to let you know when there‚Äôs a potential opportunity. For beginners, this can be a lifesaver. For advanced users, it offers enough flexibility to tweak strategies and manage risk.

It connects with various brokers in the background to execute trades, depending on your location and asset choices. You don‚Äôt need to micromanage every trade unless you want to.

## Nova Tradyx Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Supports multiple asset types (crypto, forex, stocks)
- ‚úÖ Easy-to-use interface, even for beginners
- ‚úÖ Offers automated trading options

- Tablet (iPad, Galaxy Tab, etc.)

As long as your internet connection doesn‚Äôt suck, you‚Äôre good to go.

## Nova Tradyx ‚Äì Supported Countries

Nova Tradyx claims to be available globally, but there are some **country restrictions** due to regulatory issues. Based on my research (and from similar platforms), here are some general rules of thumb:

**Supported regions:**
- Most of Europe
- Australia
- Canada
- Latin America
- Parts of Asia

**Restricted or limited regions:**
- USA
- North Korea (duh)
- Some countries in the Middle East & Africa

Always check with their support team or try signing up to see if your region is accepted.

## Nova Tradyx ‚Äì Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

Nova Tradyx constantly monitors global markets and uses algorithms to detect shifts in price patterns, trading volume, and trends. This helps users get **up-to-the-minute insights**, which is crucial if you‚Äôre trading volatile assets like crypto.

The system updates data in real time, giving you a chance to react quickly. It‚Äôs like having a Bloomberg terminal, minus the $20K price tag.

### User-Friendly Interface

This was one of the first things I noticed. The interface is **clean, modern, and not overwhelming**. Whether you‚Äôre a total newbie or a seasoned trader, you won‚Äôt feel lost in a jungle of charts and buttons.

Navigation is smooth, and all the core features are easy to find. Even the automation settings are straightforward.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there isn‚Äôt an official app (which is a bit of a letdown), the mobile browser version works surprisingly well. It‚Äôs optimized for smaller screens and offers all the same features as the desktop version.

So yeah, you can totally trade while waiting in line for your overpriced latte.

### Customizable Alerts

Nova Tradyx lets you set **price alerts and trading signals** based on your personal strategy. You get notified via email or in-platform pop-ups when certain market conditions are met.

It‚Äôs a small feature, but super helpful if you don‚Äôt want to be glued to your screen all day.

### Multiple Asset Trading

This is where Nova Tradyx really shines. Instead of being locked into just Bitcoin or Ethereum, you can trade:

- Cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, LTC, etc.)
- Forex pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/JPY)
- Stocks (Apple, Tesla, etc.)
- Commodities (Gold, Oil)

It‚Äôs like a buffet for traders.

## Is Nova Tradyx a Scam?

Short answer: **Not likely**, but always approach with caution.

It‚Äôs not a scam in the traditional sense‚Äîno sketchy withdrawals, no fake promises of ‚Äúguaranteed profits.‚Äù But like many platforms in this space, it **doesn‚Äôt provide full transparency** on who runs it.

That said, I tested it myself, made trades, and withdrew profits without any issues. Just don‚Äôt expect it to magically double your money overnight. Use it as a tool, not a miracle machine.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Nova Tradyx?

Nova Tradyx requires a **minimum deposit of $250** to activate your account and start trading. This is pretty standard across similar platforms.

Some may find this a bit steep, especially if you're just testing the waters. But hey, if you‚Äôre serious about trading, $250 is a manageable entry point.

### Nova Tradyx Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I tested their live chat at 2 AM (because that‚Äôs when I make my worst financial decisions), and someone actually responded in under 5 minutes.

They were helpful, not pushy, and seemed to know their stuff.

1kdocvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kdocvi/decaf_beans_denser_niche_zero/,Decaf beans denser? [Niche Zero],"Since getting my new grinder, I've tried 3 bags of beans (medium roast, all same roaster)... I realise this is a small sample size. But of the three, one is decaf and they needed to be ground far coarser than the others, like 25-26 on my Niche (kind of last the stated ""espresso"" range) rather than around 18-20 as for the non-decaf. They also seemed to sit lower in the portafilter for the same weight.

Just for help in dialling in more quickly in the future, I was wondering if decaf tends to need to be coarser, or was this just a coincidence? Looking online, I see different answers but perhaps what sticks out is that decaf can be more variable (?).

Of course, I realise that other factors, such as origin, date of roasting and method of decaffeination, are likely going to have a bigger impact (but a general rule of thumb would still be handy). P.S., I don't drink much decaf, but having some lets me feed my habit and drink coffee all day rather than just the morning and early afternoon üôÇ",1,1746261708.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1kdo80q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kdo80q,Star Alliance Lounge CDG Review,"I got access to the Star Alliance Lounge in Paris-CDG thanks to flying Polaris Business class. I also have the United Club Infinite Card, which would‚Äôve worked too.

Entry:
Super smooth. In the past, I‚Äôve had issues at non-United Club lounges where my boarding pass wouldn‚Äôt scan. Looking at you, Aegean in Athens. 

That can be especially frustrating when there‚Äôs a language barrier. No problems at all here.

Atmosphere:
Very different from most U.S. lounges. This place actually feels calm and relaxed. No chaotic energy, just a welcoming vibe.

Layout & Seating:
There‚Äôs a great mix of seating options: private nooks, dining tables, comfortable lounge chairs, and even an outdoor patio. 

The patio is a great space for people traveling with kids who need to move around a bit without disturbing others. 

I spent about five hours here due to a delay, and even during peak times, I never had trouble finding a seat that suited me.

Coffee (important):
They have five coffee machines. Enough said.

Food:
Breakfast was solid. There were plenty of fresh croissants and breads, as you‚Äôd expect in Paris, along with hot food like eggs, sausage, and potatoes. I also appreciated the waffles and Nutella. A well-rounded and satisfying spread.

Staff & Service:
The staff were quietly excellent. Dishes were cleared quickly, the lounge stayed clean, and the team was clearly paying attention. I watched one guest finish a bottle at the self-serve bar, and without him asking, a staff member appeared and let him know more was on the way. That kind of proactive service really stood out.

Final Thoughts:
With the Infinite Card fee going up, I‚Äôve been thinking about canceling. But honestly, experiences like this one make me reconsider. This lounge delivered comfort, efficiency, and a little bit of calm when I really needed it.",4,1746261135.0,unitedairlines,0,1.0,False

Looking for an electric grinder that will hold a 51mm portafilta (Delonghi Dedica).

New to espresso making, would prefer an electric grinder with portafilter holder to save on time for the pre-work early morning rush.

Currently have one of those blender style grinders (given as a gift) but takes so long and has a lot of waste due to coffee getting stuck at the top. Would invest ¬£100 into a hand grinder but time-saving is more important to me right now, as much as I enjoy the ritual!

1kdo54y,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kdo54y/final_destination_irl_how_i_cheated_death_twice/,Final Destination IRL: How I Cheated Death Twice and Became a Hospital Legend,"Someone just posted a comment on an unrelated thread referencing the movie ***Final Destination***.  This reminded me, that while that movie was scripted..this happened to me in real life where last year I survived 2 near death experiences (both tied to the same event) that felt like destiny...and quoting doctors and nurses **""*****people just don't survive what you did, you cheated death...twice*****.""**  All of this story is true, in every word, and happy to answer any questions if you have. 

**It all started on March 1st, 2024**. I was simply trying to water a plant - harmless enough, right? Not for me. My dog chose that exact moment to position himself silently behind my heel. Suddenly, I tripped backward - something completely unnatural for me since I'd always fallen forward in the past, if at all. Of all the directions I could have fallen, I somehow managed to hit the corner of my industrial coffee table, an extremely small target compared to the rest of my living room.  But the fun doesn't end there, I hit the only part of my coffee table made of solid steel with the very sensitive and specific part of the back of my head causing an extreme concussion.  

As I lay stunned, confused on the floor, I immediately knew something was seriously wrong. My muscles felt disconnected from my brain, weak and unresponsive. Knowing I had a serious head injury and needed help fast, I tried crawling toward my phone. But each movement was painfully slow and required intense concentration and effort. When I finally reached the phone on my nightstand, arm extended as high as I could from the group trying to get just 2 fingers on my phone to tip in my direction....then success!  2 fingers on phone and push the phone towards me on the floor...where the phone landed, and bounced...underneath my bed in a spot I had no possible way of getting now.  But I can still save myself, as I know my Apple Watch, always reliably charged is on the other nightstand.  So crawling once again, inch by inch dragging my body which felt like 5 thousands pounds of dead wight as I had no feeling in my legs at this point, I finally reach my Apple Watch.  Only on this day, this un f\*king believable day, my Apple Watch is dead and I can see the charger unplugged from the wall - a rare and cruel coincidence.  **INNER VOICE** *\*****\*Wait..did my dog pull the cord out of the wall?  Did he trip me knowing I'd need to use my watch and he strategically planned all of this? Is he actually trying to kill me?  Do I not give him enough treats?  No..that can't be really happening...can it??  Oh my G\*d...my dog is definitely trying to kill me!!!\*\****

Exhausted and unable to continue, I submit to gravity and close my eyes where I am awakened 2 days later by police and EMS in my apartment.  I had missed enough meetings for work that it triggered a wellness check from my company where paramedics broke into my apartment to find me unresponsive on the floor.  This check literally saved my life.

Within an hour I'm in the hospital's ICU unit being told I have severe rhabdomyolysis (a dangerous condition caused by muscle breakdown from lying immobile for so long) and dying of kidney failure.  ""***How is that possible...I just fell and hit my head..and I just turned 40 but work out every day and eat healthy, so why would my kidneys be failing..do you have the wrong patient's chart?""***  Before I can get a response to the question I hear a nurse tell 2 doctors in the room ""his lungs are filling will fluid fast"" and ***""get an oxygen mask on and prep for surgery""***.  As if I'm living someone else's nightmare I try to explain I don't need an oxygen mask and I'm not in kidney failure, and right before the words can leave my lips...as if all air had been stripped from my lungs and I was gasping for breathes.  The oxygen mask offers a blissful moment of sweet relief before I close my eyes and fade out.  

I would later learn that the doctors had put me at a 5% chance to survive this due to severity of my kidneys and not responding to dialysis within first 72 hours.  I was told by doctors that while it was a miracle I was alive, I wouldn't walk again for 1-2 years (best case) and I'd need dialysis for 5 to 10 years and possibly the rest of my life.  Yet, against all odds, my body began recovering...and **FAST!!!**  I took my first steps just 21 days later, and I was off dialysis in a little over 6 weeks.  In fact, my kidneys were healing at such an astonishing speed that not once, but 3 times the lab department had technicians come to recalibrate the equipment because ***""there's no way his blood results are accurate.***""  I had a team of doctors by this point (general/trauma doctors, orthopedic surgeons, nephrologists, and neurologists).  Each one telling me ***""I've been a doctor for (insert impressive amount of years here) and I've never seen a recovery like this.  You cheated death!""***  

***\*HALFTIME SCORE BOARD: Me +1 / Death 0***.  

It's now been 3 months in the hospital and I am in a special rehabilitation facility, grinding hard daily through 5 hours of PT a day.  The pain fuels me...**\*I will get stronger, I will push through the pain, I CAN DO THIS!\***   But the Final Destination movie series had many sequels so I should have know how this was going to play out.  ***DEATH ATTEMPT #2...in 3....2....1.....***

The room I'd been staying in had a door didn't that close all the way.  But on this night it was very noisy in the hallway and I finally asked to be moved to another unit where the door shuts for more quiet.  ***""We'll put a note for the manager and they can do this tomorrow if we have available rooms elsewhere.""*** Sure I can go another night like this...ya know what...HELL NO, I am trying to sleep and recover..that's your job to help me do that.  ***""Mam' I really have to insist..is there nothing you can do to help me?  I'm pushing myself through hell 5 hours a day with a broken body and all I want is for the a couple of hours of sleep before going through more hell in the morning.  If I was your son, what would you do to if you happened to work at the rehab I was at...would you double check for another room..or tell me to wait until day staff comes tomorrow.""***  I get a strong look of ***\*damnit, now I have to put my phone down and help this guy\****  And one hour later, OP is In my new room, HOLLA!!!!! 

Feeling confident from this swagger one can only attain from balling out with hospital room with a working door that closes...I decided to walk to the bathroom with my walker to finish this episode of MTV Cribs - hospital room edition.  And that's when death struck again....my walker got stuck ever so slightly while I was moving forward and instantly..seconds later I am on the ground in another extreme fall.  Nurses come running in.  While I'm a little shook up, seems like I'm ok.  But how???  How do I not land faced verse with my head across the hard bathroom floor surface? I certainly couldn't use my upper body to brace myself from the impact while holding a walker..so how?  Turns out...that room I just moved into hours earlier....had a very subtle incline in the floor that ramped up when walking towards bathroom..for draining purposes in accordance with the room for plan.  The nurses were convinced this very slight flooring design is what saved my head from colliding straight into the floor.  I am told ***""any other room in this floor and you would have hit the bathroom toilet head on.""***

I am now finally back home, 4 months after my initial fall and the realization I might be harboring a serial killer in the form of a cute puppy.  But here's the cherry on top to this story..... Less than 24 hours after being discharged from the hospital, my dog is back in my apartment and I'm taking him outside to potty. Where in his excitement to see me, or anger and rage that I am still alive..not sure at this point..he is pulling hard on his leash towards the elevator.  I can tell pretty quickly as I'm still using a cane at this point that either I'm gonna let go of the leash or fall... and so the leash is surrendered, and my dog is sprinting down the hallway.  No biggie, I'll get the elevator in a minute.  But then, as if the calm before the storm...I see my dog looking at me from down the hall as if to say ""get ready mother pupper, here I come!"" and back he sprints toward me with the zoomies dogs get and sprinting me past me, the leash he is attached to slices across my shin (right above ankle) and in a moment of disbelief I look down to see the obvious...this is going to need stitches. (shaking my head).  I am bleeding in the hall way and have a neighbor take me to back to the hospital...and once again I am questioning...\****Wait...so is my dog REALLY trying to kill me???""***

***\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*BONUS MOMENT\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\****

A few weeks later, in my apartment elevator, a girl I haven't met before is asking about my limp.  ""Hope you feel better...are you a runner or play sports?""  I laugh, no no...I'm just good at falling I tell her.  I gave her the very short version that I hit my head and was on the ground for a while, but that I'm doing much better now.  She says wow..you're lucky you didn't get ""rhabdo.""   How the HECK does this girl know what rhabdo is??  I'd never heard of the word before I was told it the thing about to kill me...how do you know what that is I ask?  ""I work at (hospital I just left)"".  Oh no way, how funny I was just there I tell her.  This girl who I have never met or spoken to....takes a very big step back and gasped  ***""Oh my God - are you Brian Miller?""*** (not my real name, but she indeed used..my VERY..REAL..FULL..NAME.  I am scared and shocked she knows this.   ***""Everyone at the hospital knows your story. You're a legend. No one survives what you survived.  I'm not even in trauma, I'm in cardiac and I still know your full story.""***  I am once more told ***""you cheated death!!""***

Today, I humorously live with the anticipation of whatever Final Destination has planned next. But until then, I guess I'm here‚Äîcheating death and apparently becoming hospital-famous and sleeping with one eye open around a very cute and innocent looking puppy.

# Best 12 oz Plastic Cups 2025: Top Brands Reviewed

The 12 oz plastic cup is a ubiquitous item, found in homes, offices, and at countless events. They offer convenience, affordability, and disposability, making them a staple for serving beverages. As we look ahead to 2025, the market for these cups continues to evolve, with manufacturers focusing on durability, sustainability, and aesthetics. Choosing the right 12 oz plastic cup involves considering factors like material quality, design, and intended use. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the top brands in this category, helping you make an informed decision for your specific needs.

[[Browse top-rated 12 oz plastic cups on Amazon]](https://itsallgarden.com/baby-care/?kw=12+oz+plastic+cups)
 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality and utility of 12 oz plastic cups depend on several key features that impact their performance and user experience.

**Material Composition**

The type of plastic used in manufacturing significantly affects the cup's durability, clarity, and safety. Polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are common choices. PP is known for its flexibility and resistance to cracking, making it suitable for hot beverages. PET, on the other hand, offers superior clarity and rigidity, ideal for cold drinks where presentation is key. The presence of BPA and other harmful chemicals is also a critical consideration, with many brands now offering BPA-free options. The thickness of the plastic also plays a role in the cup's ability to withstand pressure and prevent leaks.

**Design and Stackability**

The design of a 12 oz plastic cup goes beyond mere aesthetics; it directly impacts functionality. A well-designed cup will have a comfortable grip and a stable base to minimize spills. Stackability is another essential factor, especially for bulk storage. Cups designed with tapered sides and a slightly recessed bottom typically stack more efficiently, saving space and preventing them from sticking together. The lip of the cup should also be smooth and rounded to ensure a pleasant drinking experience.

**Durability and Leak Resistance**

A durable 12 oz plastic cup should be able to withstand reasonable handling without cracking or breaking. The strength of the material and the design of the cup's walls contribute to its overall durability. Leak resistance is equally important, particularly when serving liquids with high surface tension or when the cups are likely to be handled frequently. A tightly sealed bottom and a well-formed lip are crucial for preventing leaks. Some cups also feature reinforced rims to enhance their structural integrity.

**Temperature Resistance**

The ability of a 12 oz plastic cup to withstand temperature variations is a key consideration, especially if it will be used for both hot and cold beverages. PP cups generally offer better heat resistance compared to PET cups. It's important to check the manufacturer's specifications to determine the maximum temperature the cup can handle without warping or melting. For cold beverages, the cup should be able to withstand freezing temperatures without becoming brittle.

Key features of top 12 oz plastic cups include:
    * High-quality, BPA-free materials
    * Stackable and space-saving design
    * Durable construction to prevent cracks and leaks
    * Temperature resistance for hot and cold beverages

 ## Core Benefits

Choosing the right 12 oz plastic cup offers several practical benefits for various applications.

**Enhanced Convenience**

The primary benefit of using 12 oz plastic cups is the convenience they offer. They eliminate the need for washing and drying, saving time and effort, especially in busy environments like parties, picnics, or cafeterias. Their lightweight design makes them easy to transport and handle, reducing the risk of breakage compared to glass or ceramic alternatives. This convenience translates to less cleanup and more time to focus on other tasks.

**Improved Hygiene**

Single-use plastic cups promote better hygiene by eliminating the risk of cross-contamination associated with reusable cups. This is particularly important in settings where hygiene is a top priority, such as hospitals, schools, or daycare centers. By using disposable cups, you can ensure that each beverage is served in a clean and sanitary container, minimizing the spread of germs and bacteria. This benefit contributes to a healthier environment for everyone.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

12 oz plastic cups are a cost-effective solution for serving beverages in bulk. They are significantly cheaper than reusable cups, making them an ideal choice for large events or businesses with high consumption rates. The disposability factor also eliminates the costs associated with washing and maintaining reusable cups, such as water, detergent, and labor. This cost-effectiveness makes them a practical option for budget-conscious consumers and organizations.

**Versatility and Adaptability**

12 oz plastic cups are versatile and can be used for a wide range of beverages, including water, juice, soda, coffee, and tea. They are suitable for both indoor and outdoor use, making them a convenient choice for various occasions. Their adaptability extends to different settings, from casual gatherings to formal events. Some cups can also be customized with logos or designs, making them a great option for branding and promotional purposes.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about 12 oz plastic cups can help consumers make informed purchasing decisions.

**Are these cups recyclable?**

Many 12 oz plastic cups are made from recyclable materials like PET or PP, but recyclability depends on local recycling programs. Check with your local waste management provider to determine if they accept these types of plastics. Look for cups labeled with recycling symbols to ensure they are compatible with recycling processes. Remember to rinse the cups before placing them in the recycling bin to prevent contamination.

**Can these cups be used for hot liquids?**

The suitability of 12 oz plastic cups for hot liquids depends on the type of plastic used. PP cups are generally more heat-resistant than PET cups. Always check the manufacturer's specifications to determine the maximum temperature the cup can handle. Using cups designed for cold beverages with hot liquids can cause them to melt or warp, posing a safety risk. Opt for cups specifically labeled as suitable for hot beverages.

**How should these cups be stored?**

12 oz plastic cups should be stored in a clean, dry, and cool environment to prevent contamination and maintain their structural integrity. Keep them away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures, which can cause them to warp or become brittle. Store them in their original packaging or in a sealed container to protect them from dust and insects. Proper storage ensures that the cups remain sanitary and ready for use.

**Do these cups contain BPA or other harmful chemicals?**

Many manufacturers now offer BPA-free 12 oz plastic cups to address health concerns. Check the product labeling to ensure that the cups are certified BPA-free. Some cups may also be free of other harmful chemicals like phthalates. Choosing cups from reputable brands can provide assurance of their safety and compliance with industry standards. Prioritize cups that meet safety regulations for food contact materials.

1kdo1fa,https://i.redd.it/tkkg5j7nziye1.jpeg,2nd Week Update - Day 9 (Day 1 being when I first saw tiny bumps),"Hi, all! Just wanna give some update on my ocular (surrounding the eye) shingles, and wanted to share some insights on how shingles *may (not guaranteed)* look like in the 2nd week. 

(I guess the progression--or how fast--the recovery would be depends per person? I'm not sure.)

  
But below is like a rough timeline of what happened:

  
Day 0 (Thursday) - Splitting headache on only one side of my head--thought it was just migraine/dehydration, by evening I was seeing very tiny bumps on my eyelid, which I totally ignored. Would run my hands through my hair and felt one side of my scalp to be very sensitive to touch--I found it weird.

Day 1 (Friday) - Saw the eyelid bumps be slightly filled with water, went straight to the ophthalmologist, got prescribed Acyclovir 200 mg (30 pcs), Mefenamic Acid (--for pain management, 20 pcs, I think, I forgot), and Calamine Lotion. Started drinking antivirals, pain management meds, + slathering Calamine on the blisters.

Day 2 (Saturday) - Day 5 (Tuesday) - Blisters got bigger and scarier (worst period, imo), but **religiously** drank Acyclovir every 4 hours (also disturbing my sleep üò≠ i didn't miss a beat), which ended up with me accidentally drinking it 6 times a day (I think the prescribed amount is only 5 times a day? idk that might've been bad?), and never stopped putting Calamine lotion throughout. 

Also, Day 5 is when I went in for a follow-up check-up, got told the blisters have started scabbing (they looked slightly horrible), but was informed the inflammation was on its way out. My ophthalmologist set me up another round of antivirals, Acyclovir 200 mg (only 20 pcs), and advised I finish the whole thing even as the scabbing process goes on.

Day 6 (Wednesday) - Day 7 (Thursday) - Blisters minimally scabbing, some started flaking. Still drinking Acyclovir and slathering Calamine.

Day 8 (Friday) - Day 9 (Saturday) - Scabbing has significantly progressed. Today, I went out for some fresh air, wearing sunglasses and a cap, and got myself some coffee for surviving a crazy week!

  
I hope this helps anyone who's scared/uncertain of what it looks like after the first week (or first few weeks)! ",2,1746260359.0,shingles,1,1.0,False

**Memory Transcription Subject:**¬†***Chief Hunter Isif, Arxur Dominion***

*Date \[Standardized UFP Time\] September 4, 2136*

Scales were being shaved back on Wriss and if I did not change things soon, I will find myself facing an inquisition from Betterment. We had of course detected a massive energy front but had declined to investigate as resources could be spent elsewhere for better uses, Betterment had said that if it had become a problem I could then deal with it. Well, it definitely became a problem, soon after all raids into the prey worlds of the nearby space were stopped without a trace, save for scans from the first attempt that was made by my student of sorts, Coth. I truely did not want to mentor him but he was from a strong lineage and my tail had been twisted, apparently some ancestor of his was one of the scientists that began the research on our betterment teachings, and now he is most likely dead. He at least had the limited intellect to transmit some scans before getting himself killed.

The scans revealed an inhabited star system where previously there was just empty space, included in these scans was a planet with at least 12 billion in total population, possibly more. *Definitely not a planet we have known about, it would have been raided by now for having such a high population for culling*. There was a station in orbit of the planet as well as two ships near, all three had been giving off massive amounts of energy and their hulls had interfered with the scanners. The station alone was giving off almost as much energy as 20 of our large battle cruisers. As for the ships, aside from location not much information was gained due to its distance and hull materials, on the other claw the second ship was closer and was recorded with cameras as well. The configuration was nothing like any of the other prey ships and the fact that all ships that went in had yet to return spoke volumes. What was intesting was that this ship lacked visual weapons aside from several torpedo bays and what had seemed like a hangar bay, perhaps it was a carrier of sorts. Across the hull there was lettering that had been put through the translators and actualy came back with a match, *U.S.S Helios*. According to the translators and from some more studious of my underlings this language was of the humans, a supposedly dead fellow predator race. *Not so dead apparently.*

I had ordered several small-scale raids against the surrounding space to try and find where they had staked their claim, it appeared that their territory included the space of two prey species in my sector. I had also ordered these raids to test their capabilities, to see if these humans had perfected the art of war truly and they most certainly had. I had even *procured* the location of several ""experimental munitions"" from a Betterment official who had been sloppy with who he associated with, he had been trying to breed with one of my underlings who was far below his caste, I would not have given it much thought normally but in this case I needed to use this to twist a tail or two to get better firepower. That last raid had failed as well, those anti-matter warheads did not turn the tide at all it seemed. Betterment was getting impatient with my lack of results, and I needed to get some before they found someone who could.

That is how I wound inside a nebula that housed a listening station near their territory. I had spent considerable resources on getting it moved here in order to try to catch any FTL communications, I was shocked that they actually had those but that shock faded to annoyance as I had discovered that they were all encrypted and none of my people could even begin how to figure out how to crack the shell of the code. Fortunately it would seem that transmissions coming from the prey worlds were not always encrypted as well as they should have been, we were able to intercept those and start to pice together what was going on.

It would seem that these humans were not *our* humans but instead had jumped universes and swapped places with the ones from here. They brought several of their allies as well it would seem, from the context of the transmissions we could piece together it would seem that they are predators as well, or the sniveling prey thought they *looked* like predators, it was hard to tell. *If they have an alliance with one another, they must be more social than the Arxur*. Betterment still wanted me to supply them the same amount of food as before and they did not care how I handled this new group; they were indifferent on their existence as long as they did not interfere with our operations.

I was in my quarters looking at the nebula and the swirling blue and violet gasses, lost in thought, trying to formulate a plan on how to approach the new predators without getting killed when the comms had come to life.

""Chief hunter, we have detected an impulse wake in the nebula of a sizeable ship, there are no ships expected today.""

As I went to the bridge I considered the possiblities of what it could be, I seriously doubted that it was the prey, they have stopped going though nebulas for ages after they wisend up to us lying in wait inside of them due to thier interference with scanners. It could be a betterment offical, but that was somewhat unlikely as they preferred to announce when they will arrive to have whoever is in charge greet them and completely ruin their day. That had left one option, *the new predators. Well, that saves me trying to contact them*.

When I entered the bridge I ordered for more scans to try and pin down where the ship was and when it would arrive, even though the sensors on this station were much more sophisticated than on most of our ships it still had some trouble due to the nebula. We were unable to gather any details of the ship yet save for the fact it was giving off massive amounts of energy for a single vessel, as for heading it seemed as if it was heading straight towards the station, it would be emerging from the denser area and be seen momentary.

After what had felt like ages of waiting, the bridge had been silent and full of tension, a ship emerged. The circular edge of the main hull of the ship broke through from the gasses first and the ship just kept growing, as it got closer and I got a better look I had reliesed that it was the same ship from the scans. I accessed some of the external cameras to confirm and saw the same writing as the other ship, *U.S.S Helios. It would seem they have somehow tracked us down. Did they capture Coth and torture this out of him? I am impressed.* After a few moments of silence, we were hailed, and I ordered a response.

None of the transmissions had any sort of pictures or videos and the scholarly types I had questioned had told me that from what they knew the humans were decened from primates and of a smaller stature but they had no access to any visual aides. The creature facing me now was definitely decended from an aboreal primate. They wore a black and red covering of sorts that seemed to be a military uniform, it appeared to be significantly shorter that an Arxur at full height at **\[1.65 Meters\]** tall. Humans it seemed have a lither frame suited to agility than the Arxur. They were devoid of any fur or hair save for the head and face. This one had reddish-brown hair on its head that almost reminded me of rust with some streaks of gray. *Perhaps it is a sign of aging, like how our scales dull as we age, I know I have a few*. This creature had icy blue eyes as well that seemed to be analyzing everything you were doing, like they knew what I was going to do before even I knew it.

""Chief Hunter Isif, I am Admiral Kathyrn Janeway of the United Federation of Planets. I have been sent to make contact with you and your Dominion in order to avoid any future *problems*.""

*How does she know who I am? Have they been spying on us? It is supposed to be the other way around.* After getting over my momentary shock at both being found on purpose and being known by this human I responded. I needed to not show any weakness lest betterment get wind of this, I need to talk to them face to face.

""Hrrr, you know my name, yes? Very well Admiral Kathryn Janeway, we have much to discuss. You are new predators; I will enjoy learning of a new predator. You may send a shuttle so we may get to the meat of this and I can learn *how* exactly you found us.""

""Very well Chief Hunter"" The Admiral said, ""I will take a shuttle to the bay below your bridge so we may talk face to face.""

I grunted an affirmative in response and disconnected the hail. I ordered my personal guards with me to have a welcoming party in the landing bay that is *supposed* to be reserved for betterment officials. Since it was a high ranking seeming to be predator I could make an exception. As I made my way down to the shuttle bay, I had begun to rack my mind with what she wanted to discuss, most likely our incursions into their space. If they want compensation for that they will not receive it, they have taken territory from me that was very lucrative for me to fill the quotas of betterment. When I entered the bay I saw one of the scientists who had been lurking about the station tuning the sensors, they reported directly to Betterment, so I had limited authority over them, to deny them a learning opportunity would be to defy the authority of Ginzel himself, they were the only Arxur who were encouraged to indulge in curiosity.

""Scientist"" I stated as I approached the smaller Arxur ""I assume you wish to speak with the new one?""

""Yes, Chief Hunter"" He responded with his tail slowly twitching at the tip with curiosity ""If our infromation is correct then these humans have formed an alliance with other possibly predator species as well. I wish to discover how this is possible, perhaps it is linked to past hunting practices?""

""Perhaps, it could be for another reason, yes?"" I responded as I saw the shuttle enter the bay and begin to land. ""Regardless, after your questions you will be asked to leave. There are discussions we will be having that are even above your station."" I received a tail flick in confirmation and that was all as we waited for the Admiral to exit the shuttle.

After a short while I heard the hiss of the door opening and saw the human step out, alone. *I must admire her confidence, none of the prey species would ever dream of being close to an Arxur, especially alone.* What I had thought was confirmed when I saw this one in person, they were definitely smaller than us. Even when in my default slouching posture I was still taller than this Admiral. One thing I noticed was that she seemed to have a satchel across her shoulder and at least two sperate pouches of sorts on the pants of her uniform.

""Admiral"" I growled ""Welcome, you wish to talk, yes? I have a place where we may talk in private, before that this scientist from betterment has some questions. Could you speak to him first before we break the shell on these talks? He has questions.""

The Admiral looked between myself and the scientists a moment before smiling, a trait many had thought solely belonged to the Arxur. As she walked towards us, she began to speak.

""Not one for small talk, are you?"" She started ""I suppose I could spare some time before our talks begin, I should be able to answer any relevant questions you have. Just so long as you don't ask for any government secretes.""

Before I could respond the scientist did, with much more enthusiasm that I thought possible for our kind outside of a feast while we started to walk towards the commands ready room.

""Of course, Admiral Kathyrn Janeway. Very curious, yes? Two names, is it common for your kind? The name is Lanzel""

As we continued to walk the Admiral was always kept her head straight forward, but her eyes betrayed her. She was looking at every console, power line and hatch. She was mentally picking apart everything she saw, including us most likely.

""Not curious at all for my kind."" She started ""For future reference when you use titles for those with more than one time it is just the title and the last name. So, others in a professional setting would just call me Admiral Janeway, it would only me in a informal setting that I would be called Kathyrn. But to answer your question, just about every human has more than one name.""

*Curious, how did that come about? Perhaps the last name is a way to keep track of bloodlines*. It did not take long for us the reach the ready room. I sat down at the head while Admiral Janeway took the seat next to me and Lanzel took a seat from across from her. So far this entire time the Admiral had not seem affected by anything, that changed when she looked up and saw the light fixture that had been put in place by the previous commander. It was several 5-point sets of antlers from Fissan's that had been interlocked with dim lights ensared within, it did create a unique light pattern and I did not care enough one way or another to have it moved. When the Janeway had saw it, her eyes had widened for just a moment in what could have been surprised. As we settled in, I motioned for Lanzel to begin.

""Admiral, I have questions on the history of how your people hunted in the past"" He started ""We Arxur would ambush our prey, this led to our more solitary attitude. Even today we only gather when it is to achieve a goal that cannot be gained alone. So, what was the hunting strategy that worked for your kind?""

The admiral seemed to be thinking for a few seconds before she responded.

""Interesting question Lanzel, humans throughout history have used a myriad of different hunting methods. But many agree the most tried and true method we used before the advent of farming was persistent hunting. Ancient humans would venture out in hunting parties and chase after a target, due to being bipedal and a few other anatomical advantages we possess superior stamina to most other species and would chase until the target dropped from exhaustion. Of course, that all changed with agriculture and then later we were able to improve with our technology.""

""Hm, that would require sufficent teamwork and trust to accomplice, yes?"" Lanzel spoke before turning to me ""That explains it, they had to embrace empathy for one another in order to succeed in these group hunts, that is how they ally with others, some sort of misplaced empathy. I shall take my leave now.""

With that last remark Lanzel stood up and left which had irked me, he undermined my authority in front of the Admiral, any other person that would dare do that to the Chief Hunter would have broken bones. Her explanation did raise some possibilities for possible ways of thinking for her people, if they evolved to run after prey as long as she claims they may think and plan further ahead than others. They may have gained a stubbornness from it as well. After he had left and a few moments had passed the Admiral spoke up.

""So, let's talk, shall we? To avoid repeating what we both already know. I am aware of the circumstances around your uplift, circumstances that the Orion Arm Federation have conveniently left out. Such as their *cure* they delivered to you and your cattle. I am also aware that you know that the United Federation of Planets is made up of more than just my species.""

*How does she know this? Coth was not aware of even the human being back before he was sent on his attack so it could not solely be from an interrogation.*

""How do you know these things? It could not all be from torturing any Arxur you captured?""

The Admiral continued to look at me with those icy eyes, like she was dissecting every word I said.

""Before we continue"" She said while dropping her voice into almost a whisper ""How sure are you that this room is not being recorded?""

*Why would we be recorded? She just docked; there was no time for a device to be placed.*

""Why would there be a device? We just learned of your arrival. If you are so worried you can check for yourself, I will not waste energy on a pointless task.""

The Admiral let out a small series of huffs that my translator read as a light laugh. *So, she finds this humorous?* She opened one of the pouches on her uniform and pulled out a metallic device that fit in her hand and flipped it open to read its screen. As she started pointing it at different directions in the room I could hear it give off a high pitched hum. After a few seconds the hum changed as she walked around the table and reached under at the spot where Lanzel had sat, she pulled out a small circular device that I recognized immediately, it was a listening device used by betterment when defectiveness of the mind is suspected. She slid it over to me where I had immediately crushed it with my fist as she made her way back to her seat.

""I don't care to be listened in on; I find it's always good to make sure that I am not."" She began ""And to answer your questions from before, we captured Coth and his entire crew. They have been held planetside and questioned but not tortured. We have laws against the torture of those in our custody, moral issues aside it just doesn't provide accurate results. We have other less barbaric methods for getting information from our prisoners.""

I squinted at her at that admission, she had just admitted to holding my people prisoner. It was odd that they had rules against torture, it seems they have done it enough to realize it is not effective. She also mentioned that they have better methods than torture for information gathering.

""So, you admit you are holding Arxur Prisoner? Also, what are these other methods you speak of?""

""Yes, I admit it"" Said the Admiral in a more forceful tone than before ""Coth had violated our space and when informed by me he fired upon our vessels, since then there have been 10 other incursions into our space which have been dealt with similarly. As for these other methods, one of the good things about an alliance with other species is that we all of our strengths. The Vulcans for one have some impressive mental abilities, and though physical contact extract information if the situation calls for it.""

*So, they have psychics? I have never heard of a species with such abilities. They truly are unique; I need to get Coth back before he spills all of our information*.

""Chief Hunter, from where I stand it seems you were trying to figure out our borders correct"" The admiral said, once I nodded, she continued ""All right then, I have a proposal if you are interested in negotiating""

As she said that she opened her bag and pulled out a data pad and a small metallic box along with what appeared to be a cylinder with a lid. She opened the cylinder and began to drink from it which surprised me as it was giving off steam, it was giving off a bitter smell, but she seemed quite relaxed by it though.

""Go ahead I am listening."" I said ""What is that beverage? It smells like bitter herbs. Do you consume both plants and flesh?""

""Coffee, we drink it for the energy boost, finest organic suspension ever made. Yes, to your question though, humans and the other species of the UFP can eat both plants and meat, in what ratios depends on the needs of the species."" Janeway stated before continuing as she seemed to be pulling up star charts. ""As for a deal, I can offer you a quite a large amount of meat for a few considerations on your part. First, you will respect the borders of the UFP and stay out unless it is for diplomatic purposes, or you are invited. The second we have acquired a few allies and we in exchange for not attacking the ones in your territory we will supply you with more than enough meat to exceed your quotas for Betterment. Thirdly, any citizen species that are caught up in your raids will be brought back to us unharmed. Finaly, there are several planets that are on the edge of you territory that have not been touched for centuries, we would be willing to trade for those as they are close to our territory. Any agreement we come to today will also involve the release of the Arxur prisoners.""

*She has guts I will admit that, to demand from the Arxur to stay out of their territory and they territory of the other leaf lickers is bold*. I was curious about how they would manage to supply us with enough meat to stave off questions from betterment without starving themselves. As for the planets I did not care, most of the population lived on Wriss or conquered world, it was much easier to do that than to build from the ground up, but she did not have to know that. I could get quite the catch from this new Federation if I played things out correctly. As for citizens being returned that was a given, they are predators as well, not cattle.

""These terms, while I do not fully understand why you would ally with some leaf lickers I will not stop you from burning yourself. I will need a list of species, if they are not in my sector I cannot help you, not every Chief Hunter is as charming or understanding as the one before you."" I spoke ""As long as you give me a territory map no Arxur should cross your border. If I tell Betterment of the location of the new predators then you will not be bothered. As fellow predators, if any of your people are caught up in a raid they will be returned, the teachings of Betterment dictate that all predators be given respect and never eaten. For these planets though, I will need to be assured of your production capabilities before I just give them to you.""

Janeway sat in silent for a few moments with her hand on her chin as she was listening to me and digesting what I had just said before speaking.

""Of course, you want to make sure that we can keep our end of the bargain. I have here on my data pad the total mass of the meat in my ship's cargo that can be transported to you right now, think of it as a downpayment of sorts, to show you that we can fulfill our end of the deal.""

When she slid her pad over to me and I looked at the numbers in my language my eyes nearly bulged out of my head from the number of zeros. *This is the more than the meat you would get from a large cattle ship after a successful raid, how is this possible?!* I cleared my throat before I spoke, trying to keep an air of calmness.

""Yes, impressive Admiral. You will need to tell me some day how you were able to get this much meat, yes? Can you give me a list of the species you wish to *associate* with. I can feel the mention of the cattle already in my space, I feel as if you don't approve of them. I will trade for them too, yes?""

The Admiral chuckled as she started typing into the pad.

""No, the United Federation of Planets does not, we have in the past dealt with a species similar to your own who tried to hunt *us*. We hope that we may peacefully exist next to one another. As for the *cattle* as you put it, we are willing to make incremental trades for them. You are the one who will be in charge of a cover story with betterment, so you decide how much and where. We will trade you the estimated weight plus 10%. That seems more that fair given we will be giving you cuts of meat much more nutrient dense. Here is the list.""

*They were hunted. That other species must not have believed in anything like Betterment.* As I was looking at the list, I had begun to realize that I may not need to raid at all if these new predators keep to their word. Most of my sector was on the list so I would be getting enough meat to not need to attack at all. The cattle trade seemed lucrative as well, I would have to think of a way to pull it off though. One name did jump out to me, *I should probably tell Janeway about this one. She may not like what will happen soon.*

""These terms are acceptable. Most of these are in my sector, I have marked which ones are not. Although one of the ones in my sector will be raided soon but not by me. I do not know why but a Betterment has ordered Shaza to attack them, it is quite odd on two faces. Betterment rarely orders attacks, they only get involved when not enough meat is being brought in. Secondly, it is my sector, but they asked another Chief Hunter to lead this attack. Quite odd, anyways it should be happening within the next day or so.""

The Admiral looked surprised as well. *It is odd then; she must understand the frustration from having oders that make no sense.* Just then the door opened and in walked Lanzel with a scowl on his face.

""You!"" He pointed a claw at the Admiral ""You destroyed my device didn't you? That is the property of the Arxur Dominion""

Janeway stood up and straightened her uniform before speaking.

""I did not destroy it buy I found it, you honestly should pick better hiding places than under the table at the spot you sat at.""

This apparently would not stand with Lanzel as he started to roar at Janeway ""You have ruined moons worth of work! You will pay for your arrogance!""

I had stood up to stop him from charging but before I could do anything the Admiral had pulled out a weapon and I saw three pulses of blue hit Lanzel in quick succession as a whirring sound emitted on the device. After being hit he fell to the ground, but still breathing. *Was this how they captured Coth?*

""Which species Isif?"" She asked rather curtly as she turned to face me as if she had not just shot someone.

Feel free to leave a review. Criticism is accepted as I am an amateur writer, and I would appreciate the feedback. Thank you for reading.

Note: This story takes place on the perspective of a civilian outside of Kivotos, so there wouldn't be too much mentions of Blue Archive students

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's been weeks now ever since the scandal of about the daughter of the owner who is supposedly the next successor of Saint Nephthys Company turned out to be a scumbag who not only betrayed their teacher for a handsome man, but apparently she committed several crimes like attempted murder, assault, destruction of private property and whatnot. The incident has been such a juicy scandal for journalists to cook and milk everything they can from the situation for attention, a quick buck or whatever reason they had. Even when the teacher who has been living in hell because of the students returned to Kivotos, journalists would do whatever they can to get a scoop out of it.

*(Sighs)* ""Don't these blast journalists ever get tired? I've been interviewed by the same journalist for 3 days now! I'm starting to think he might be targeting me on purpose, should I file a harassment case?""

""Oh come on, you have good looks, any man would do whatever trick they have in their sleeve to be able to talk to you!""

""Shut it! You know damn well I have a standard for my dream man!""

""There to you again with the high standards, you should learn to be realistic""

The two female workers laugh, it's been a long day after all and everyone needed their well deserved break, especially now that their office was starting to stink of sweat. While many of the workers were able to head home despite the constant pestering of the journalist and media outlets, it was the poor managers who has to stay behind and deal with the issue of PR management. Some of them hasnt left the building for weeks, too busy with the constant calls and apologizes they're doing, reaching the point they ask their subordinates to buy them food from outside while they bath in the restroom with make do equipment.

""It's been a long week, why won't these journalists go to Kivotos instead? Pester the teacher? Why us out of all people""

""Hey, cut him some slack, he's been falsely accused of r@p3, blackmail, sexual harassment and whatever false accusations thrown at him without basis. If anything, he deserves a break more than us.

""I guess you're right, and to be fair, he did survive that 6 months of hell of being starved, kicked, dehumanized and running away from people who want to kill him.""

""And entire schools with guns too... It's crazy how he survived that long when he can just be popped to the ground dead by some long range shooter.

""Everybody- look, what we're experiencing right now is nothing compared to what he experienced. In another week or two, the media will grow tired of this and eventually drop the topic.""

The workers give each other a tired laugh, trying to ignore their own manager on the other side of the room, desperation etched in his voice.

""I- look- we're doing what we can to investigate the issue, we are- no! Please! We already have plenty on our plates! We can't afford to lose another stockholder-! ....I understand, on behalf of the Company, we respect your decision, and we sincerely applogize for the mistrust you see on the company""

The manager with a shaky breath, sighs as she puts down the telephone before rubbing her temples.

""This is not good... Another stockholder is pulling their investments out from the company, claiming that they can't trust us anymore after the incident of Kivotos and the Izayoi daughter... Damn her! If she just used her brain than spreading her legs for cheap thrills, we wouldn't be in this mess!""

""Calm down department head Keichi, take deep breaths and keep your head cool. Pointing fingers is not going to help us with our situation""

""Sorry chief, it's just that... Damn it... How could she be so stupid? Choosing her own lust over logic? I can't even fathom how much that teacher is feeling, all those hardwork and memories just to be discarded like a lollipop stick? It just makes me sick.""

""All of us feel sick from it, which is why we have to keep moving to distract ourselves so we wouldn't waste time on hating someone, learned that from my anger management classes. Hah!""

""Sorry to burst your bubble, but that's not what's happening right now. The media all around us, business partners cutting ties, stockholders pulling out their investments and other corporates refusing dialogue with us is literally making us remember what she did.""

""I... Can't argue with that.... Ok you win, I'll give you a beer later.""

The company workers chuckle, despite telling themselves that they can work through this, it was getting harder not to blame Nonomi Izayoi, the daughter and supposed successor to the company. They know her, she's visited them in the past, checking up on them and offering a helping hand as training for the future when she becomes the new company president. But now, all of those were nothing more but memories, their opinion towards her was now altered in a way that could never be changed. They no longer saw her as the once helpful and kind girl that would help them in the officer by offering to give them coffee, scan papers, or take their job of shredding documents. All they saw in her was a scumbag who willingly threw away her teacher who helped her in times of need and repayed him with ungratefulness because she couldn't control her lust. Despite their opinion on her, some office workers still held on to the hope and belief that the girl they once knew is still there and it's not too late, they know they're fooling themselves, but they can't help it. Because without hope, they won't be able to function as a cog in a workforce, and if they can't function, they'll be replaced, and if they're replaced, they would be out of employment. They can't have that, which is why they delude themselves to have hope.

""Ok everyone! We had a long day, so let's call it quits for tonight and rest easy, me and the other managers will take care of the work here, so please be good little kouhais and head home and rest.""

Sighs could be heard around the office. They were aching to stop doing what they were doing and just head home to rest, many of the workers give their higher ups last looks of pity before heading out. They were going to remain and continue to control the situation which seemed more and more like a losing fight. Investors were calling them ""not trustworthy"" and pulling out left and right. Workers leave the building and is once more swarmed with journalists asking for an interview on their opinions. It took a lot for the workers to resist punching them in the face and breaking their cameras, they were already in hot water for simply being a worker for Saint Nephthys Company, they don't need to increase the heat further because otherwise it's their livelihood on the line. Once home, the workers sleep, tomorrow was a weekend so they're not going to work tomorrow, none of them intends to because for the past weeks, they've given their weekends to the company to help alleviate the damages done by Nonomi to its name, this time, they're staying home and just like on the bed and pretend this was all just a nightmare.

**(The next morning)**

...

*Ring-ring-ring ring!*

...

*Ring-ring-ring ring!*

...

*Ring-ring-ring ri-*

""What do you want?! It's 7 in the morning and I don't plan to go to work today!""

""No, turn on your TV""

""What?""

""Just turn on your TV, it doesn't matter which channel""

*Confused, the worker stands up and walks over to the living room where the let cat lies on the couch.*

""Heh, lucky bastard. How much I wish I can just be a cat, no work, no issues to think about. Just worry about what disgusting food your owner gives you.""

The TV is turned on and much to the worker's surprise, it was the owners of the company they work it, the Izayoi Family, there was going to be a scheduled press conference on 10AM, all of them wearing business suits for later, the daughter, Nonomi had a bandage over her cheek. Many questions pop one after another as the worker attempts to understand the situajton. Was she hurt? Did her parents hit her? Will rival companies take advantage of this? The worker shakes those thoughts aside as they prepare coffee and breakfast. The cat meows and they laugh.

""Understood you little schei√üe, I'll give you breakfast first, because the almighty omnipotent who works and buys all the food you eat is a slave to a you who will destroy my home if I don't do anything.""

*(Opens a can of tuna)*

""Damn it... just this once, I'll give you something fancy since we're out of cat food""

The worker opens a can of expensive tuna and the cat immediately perks it's ears from it before jumping off the couch and waits on its food bowl. The cat usually waits until the food is on its bowl, but today, it was patiently waiting like an eager kid waiting for chicken nuggets.

""Eager today aren't we?""

The worker laughs as he gives the cat it's tuna. It was an early Saturday morning after all, so why not do something for a change? The worker puts on their shoes before heading out for a morning jog at a nearby park. For once, it felt nice, not being chased by data hungry journalists and just embracing the cold morning air in the park. Spotting a nearby playground, they decided that why not? Do some exercises on it. The worker does pull ups on the monkey bars, and does push-ups and planking on the hard sidewalk, people were also going out for a morning walk or jog, so a few people joined in on his exercise. After an hour or so, he decided that he's had enough for the morning and heads back to his apartment. The cat was sleeping, it's face happy from it's expensive feast, with a chuckle the worker closes the door and cooks himself the breakfast he deserves, starting with coffee and a plate of bacon and eggs with a side of cake from the other night. While cooking, he looks at the clock and noticed that it's now 9:50AM, perfect timing, he could eat breakfast and watch the public press conference.

It takes a few minutes for their breakfast to finish cooking and the coffee to stop boiling before he finally sits on the kitchen table and turn on the TV. The office worker couldn't help but feel a twinge of pity for the owners as they watch the apology of the Izayoi Family. None of them were at fault, yet here they are apologizing for the actions their daughter caused. As the worker eats his breakfast, he continues to watch the TV, the family then spoke about saying that they failed as parents because they didn't supervise their own daughter on her actions. As the media journalists shoot them with question after question, the blame ultimately falls on the daughter of the family and entirety of Highlander Railroad Adademy (HRA). The daughter, Nonkmy was expected to be the next successor and yet she showed herself to not be trusted. The student council was also blamed for the actions of all of HRA because they failed to report the incidents to the higher ups of the Saint Nephthys Company, implying that the company doesn't know any of it until the news about sensei returning did they learn the extent of the damages.

As the press conference continues, the worker who was now washing the dishes of their breakfast listens as the Izayoi Family disavow their own daughter. Nonomi was the next successor, but she wasn't an employee of the company, meaning she was being thrown under the bus by her own parents.

**""While our daughter was the next successor, she has shown herself unworthy of such position. And her actions does not represent Saint Nephthys Company because she is not an employee, most of her actions are of her own individual doing, including the students of Highlander Railroad Adademy.""**

The worker stops before slowly looking at the TV, she could see the face of the daughter, full of despair, guilt and acceptance of her situation. The worker knew that Nonomi deserves to be punished, but this... this was just too cruel, making them feel bad for her as the owners on TV speak about severing ties with HRA and showing their intention to pay compensation for the teacher Nonomi hurt and many others, including repayment of every terminated contract Saint Nephthys had with Schale because of the incident. And all of this said out loud on live television as well...

""Damn... that's... just messed up... being forced to acknowledge your sins and crimes for all to see... And on TV too""

The worker sighs as they finish putting the last plate onto the plate rack to dry. They step outside the balcony and lights up a cigarette, they would be turning up their resignation letter on Monday, after all the stuff they had to go through on this company, this felt like a wake-up call for him to leave and find a new job before things go even worse. They already have a new company in mind and has a resume for it. With a nod, they take an inhale of the burning nicotine stick before heading back inside to continue his life. Because after all, life doesn't wait for others, it goes on, leaving those stuck in the past behind, and the worker has life goals too, he can't stay in the past and loath about a company scandal.

1kdnxpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1kdnxpw/my_comprehensive_review_of_yourbiology_collagen/,My comprehensive review of YourBiology Collagen+ (4.5/5 Stars): Is this the best marine collagen with multi-vitamins?,"I give YourBiology Collagen+ a solid 4.5/5 stars. As someone who's tried over a dozen collagen supplements over the years (from powders to pills to liquid shots), I've become pretty discerning about what actually works versus what's just clever marketing. This one genuinely impressed me.

## What Makes YourBiology Collagen+ Stand Out

The first thing I noticed was the quality of the main ingredient. Unlike many collagen supplements that use cheap bovine sources, [YourBiology uses Naticol¬Æ Marine Collagen](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/ybcollagen.php) from fish, which my body seemed to absorb much more efficiently.

If you've tried collagen before without seeing results, this higher bioavailability marine collagen might be the game-changer you need.

What really sets this apart from other collagen products I've tried is the comprehensive formula. Instead of just throwing collagen in a tub and calling it a day, they've included 10 targeted **ingredients that work synergistically:-**

Based on some data from people I recommended it to (including some clients I coach):s-

- **Marine Collagen**: Within 3 weeks, some noticed fine lines looking less pronounced
- **Hyaluronic Acid**: My typically dry skin stayed hydrated much longer throughout the day
- **Vitamin C**: This boosts your natural collagen production (something many brands overlook)
- **Biotin**: Some of my clients‚Äô nails stopped breaking and splitting within the first month
- **Magnesium & B12**: I experienced a noticeable energy boost, which was an unexpected bonus

## My Experience

In my first month, the changes were subtle but noticeable. By week two, my chronically dry skin felt more hydrated and bouncy.

By week four, some people I recommended it to who complained about hair shedding had it reduced significantly, and their nails were growing stronger without the brittleness.

The most impressive result came around the 8-week mark form one client who commented that when the nasolabial folds around her mouth (those annoying smile lines) appeared visibly softened. Her husband actually commented on it unprompted, which is when we knew it wasn't just wishful thinking on her part.

If you're dealing with early signs of aging, dull skin, or brittle nails, I'd recommend giving this at least 60 days to see the full effects. The changes happen gradually, but they're definitely real.

## How It Compares to Other Collagen Brands

Having previously tried popular brands like Vital Proteins and Ancient Nutrition, I found YourBiology to be superior in a few key ways:

- **Taste**: Unlike the fishy aftertaste in many marine collagens, both flavor options (Mixed Berry and Lemon & Pineapple) are genuinely enjoyable. I actually looked forward to drinking it.
- **Texture**: It dissolves completely with no gritty residue. **I've tried** [**Great Lakes**](https://amzn.to/4c7EjHT) and Sports Research collagens that left a sandy texture, but this blends seamlessly into my morning smoothie or even plain water.
- **Formula**: While [**Vital Proteins**](https://amzn.to/4lnkS2e) **offers** just plain collagen peptides, YourBiology's added vitamins and minerals address overall skin, hair, and joint health from multiple angles.
- **Results**: My clients saw more dramatic improvements in skin's elasticity and nail strength than with Ancient Nutrition's Multi Collagen, which they had used for 6 months prior.

## Where It Falls Short

No product is perfect, and I want to be completely transparent about the drawbacks:

1. **Price Point**: It's definitely at the premium end of the market. However, considering you're getting 10 active ingredients versus just plain collagen, the value is still there.
2. **Not Vegan-Friendly**: Since it uses marine collagen, this isn't suitable for vegetarians or vegans. If that's you, you might want to look at **Ora Organic's plant-based collagen** booster instead.
3. **Limited Flavors**: While both flavors are excellent, having more options would be nice for variety.

## Who Will Benefit Most From YourBiology Collagen+?

If you're like me and have tried other collagen supplements without impressive results, this formula might be worth the upgrade. I would especially recommend it if:

- You're in your late 30s or beyond and noticing fine lines, crepey skin, or loss of firmness
- Your hair is thinning or your nails break easily
- You experience joint stiffness, especially in the morning
- You want a one-and-done collagen with multi-vitamin supplement that addresses multiple beauty concerns
- You're willing to invest a bit more for quality and comprehensive ingredients

I would not recommend this if you're looking for an overnight miracle or if you're on an extremely tight budget. This is a premium product that works gradually over time.

## My Daily Routine

What worked best for me was mixing one scoop with cold water first thing in the morning (I prefer the Mixed Berry flavor). It became part of my morning ritual ‚Äì I'd drink it while checking emails, then follow with breakfast about 30 minutes later. The subtle energy boost from the B12 and magnesium was perfect for starting my day.

Some days I'd mix it into my smoothie instead, but I found taking it on an empty stomach seemed to maximize absorption.

## Bottom Line

[**YourBiology Collagen+**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/ybcollagen.php) **earns its 4.5/5 rating** by delivering noticeable results across multiple fronts ‚Äì skin elasticity, hair strength, nail growth, and even energy levels. Is it the cheapest option? No. But is it worth the investment if you're serious about addressing age-related beauty concerns? Absolutely.

If you've been disappointed by other collagen supplements or want to simplify your routine with one comprehensive formula instead of multiple products, I'd highly recommend giving YourBiology Collagen+ a 60-day trial.

With their money-back guarantee, you can see for yourself if it works as well for you as it did for me.

## What is YourBiology Collagen+?

**YourBiology Collagen+** is a collagen supplement packed with **super absorbable** Collagen, plus **10** other **beauty-boosters** like Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, and **Biotin** to get you glowing again.

**It‚Äôs** a premium **marine collagen supplement** specifically designed to support your **skin, hair, nails, joints**, and **gut health**.

They packed **10 science-backed ingredients** into this powerhouse formula, including **Vitamin C** to boost natural collagen production, **Hyaluronic Acid** to keep your skin supple, and **Biotin** for stronger hair and nails.

On top of that, it‚Äôs sugar-free, free of fillers, and easy to mix into water or smoothies for a tasty, fuss-free boost to your wellness routine.

Sourced from sustainably harvested fish, this collagen is a game-changer. Why? Because it‚Äôs **highly bioavailable**, meaning your body absorbs it much more effectively than other collagen types (like bovine).

If you‚Äôre dealing with **wrinkles, sagging skin, or weak nails**, marine collagen helps restore elasticity, making your skin **firmer** and **plumper** while strengthening hair and nails. Plus, it also supports **bone density** and **joint mobility**..

### **2\. Vitamin C**

C**ollagen production** doesn‚Äôt just ‚Äúhappen.‚Äù Your body needs **Vitamin C** to trigger the process. This vitamin is like the best friend that makes collagen more effective by boosting its production naturally.

On top of that, Vitamin C is a **powerful antioxidant**, which means it protects your skin from **free radicals** caused by pollution, UV rays, and stress. If you‚Äôre seeing dull skin or fine lines creeping in, this is one ingredient you _really_ want in your corner.

### **3\. Hyaluronic Acid**

Ever feel like your skin is dry no matter how much moisturizer you slap on? Enter **Hyaluronic Acid**. This magical molecule acts like a **moisture magnet**, pulling water into your skin to keep it hydrated and **super supple**.

Plus, Potassium supports your **vitality and energy levels**, making it especially important if you‚Äôre staying active or just want to feel your best as you age.

### **6\. Magnesium**

In **YourBiology Collagen+**, Magnesium works to:

- Boost your **energy levels**.

- Improve your **mood** and relaxation.

If you‚Äôre constantly tired, stressed, or sore after workouts, Magnesium can be a _lifesaver_.

1kdnxpk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kdnxpk,Restaurant Zeik Hamburg (1 Michelin Star) - By Maurizio Oster),"This was my first time having dined in a one Michelin star restaurant. I was having a great experience! The first bites ahead of the first courses presented cabbage turnip in various ways with great focus on bringing out strong and savoury umami-flavours of it. - My favourite of it had to either be strong flavoured, delicious soup of cabbage turnip alongside the crisp with a fine mousse and smoked elements of cabbage turnip. This was followed by a delicious dish of tarragon hollandaise, Safran foam, dill and marinated fennel, just to name the most prominent ingredients. The bread course was straight forward with a nice rustic loaf of bread and some savoury herbal butter. For the next dish we were presented with different varieties of beetroot and a really exciting, superb ‚ÄûMizuna mousse‚Äú - fantastic! Following up was the carrot course, incredibly savoury and an utter explosion of carrot - literally the platonic essence of a carrot. This dish paired really well with a nicely aged Riesling and its acidity. The next course consisted of white asparagus with a beautiful texture, some crunch, a cream of hemp and some lardo - super interesting and utterly delicious. Up next was a fish dish of pickled char with an intensely smoked sauce and a fantastic and uplifting, really clean char tatar with an onion ceviche and fried buckwheat - nice textures. As for the next course we enjoyed a menu extension ‚ÄûThe lamb - celebrated‚Äú: skewers of lamb, a lamb taco, a fragrant broth of lamb with mint oil, lamb belly, glazed jus and brioche of lamb shoulder - absolutely stunning and savoury all the way, but never too heavy or overpowering. This was was served with a German Fr√ºhburgunder, a genetically related grape variety Pinot Noir - lovely. Next: Lamb - again. But we didn‚Äôt mind, it was just too good: A delicate lamb flavour, very nicely grilled, beautifully pink. It was accompanied by a lamb jus, parsley jus, lemon zests and a varnish of apple and celeriac plus an onion reduction. Again, intense and hearty but also uplifting. The pre-dessert was made up of a sorrel sorbet, a vanilla-vinegar gel, and espuma of elderflower, kumquats and a ragout of mirepoix (?) - very acidic, but also very refreshing after the savoury lamb dishes - nice! The dessert revolved around rhubarb - a sorbet, a sauce, a ragout, a gel etc. for me, it was just a little bit too acidic and I had wished for something a little sweeter. Luckily, it was accompanied by some sweeter ice cream, some nut brittle, and a vanilla cream. All in all, the dessert wasn‚Äôt a disappointment but the weakest course of the menu, for my taste. The Petit Fours, however, were very much to my likings: a parfait of coffee and cardamom, a praline of vanilla and cheesecake, and, last but not least, a wild berry sorbet with parsley oil and ros√© champagne. 

This was a great and absolutely delicious experience! I loved the creativity on the vegetarian dishes especially, good atmosphere in the restaurant, kind and warm service and a very good wine accompaniment. I recommend to give restaurant Zeik a visit. ",5,1746259922.0,finedining,4,0.86,False

I shouted at them and left mid-party(despite my friends convincing me to stay).As it was the first time, he was so consumed by the effect that I had to balance him towards the car.He was in no state to drive.I know how to drive the car though have never driven long distance.So I decided to take him to the my flat where I stay as it was much closer than his house.After reaching my flat I made him rest in my bedroom who was blabbering and rolling there(which I felt was cute).Then happened the worst possible thing I never thought I'd do.Before him I never was in any kind of relationship(as studies and building a good career was always my first priority).So with a man(who is my husband to be) in my flat and the alone moment with him clouded my judgement.I became physical with him while he was not in a good state of mind.I don't know why I did it.But it happened.There were moments I heard him say in a stammering tone,*""after marriage di..""* but I was too consumed by the moment and things happened between us.When he woke up he was so confused and we both couldn't see our faces properly.There was silence for a few minutes until he asked me about what happened.I couldn't able to tell him the truth.I lied that it all happened in the heat of the moment and we ended up doing the deed.My fianc√© was startled,then apologized,had a coffee and left within an hour.But I am the one who need to be sorry;not him.The guilt of hiding what happened is killing me inside.At the same time I fear about him remembering the actual incident and thoughts like,""What will he think of me if he remembers?"";""Will he think low of me?"",""Will it leave a dent in our relationship?"" etc., often pester me.So far he never talked about **that day**.But I really want to apologise to him,but I couldn't gather the courage to reveal the truth.

**So that is why I created this account to have some closure about what I have done and ask for people's opinions about this.If you want to judge me,yes you can.I think I deserve it.But at the same time I will be glad if you guys can help me in this.Thank you...**",1,1746259897.0,DeepIndianConfessions,0,0.99,False
