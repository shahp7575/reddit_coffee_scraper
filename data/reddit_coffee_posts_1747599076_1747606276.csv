The Seeker and the Stranger ride on a white steed through a barren landscape. Lands of Savannah, desolate and empty. The Horse follows the trail of Dried up riverbeds. The sun burns on their skins.

“What exactly are we after?” asks the Seeker the Stranger, while wiping the sweat from their forehead.

“The Holy Grail,” responds the grinning Stranger.

“It's a symbol used in many stories, representing the unification of opposites. The Union of the Divine Male and Divine Feminine Aspects of Consciousness. It's a Merging of Order and Chaos, of Intelligence and Love, of rationality and creativity. By balancing out both Aspects of the Self. By Synchronizing both hemispheres of the brain. By ending all Dualities within, creating Peace between Logic and Love. A state of inner equilibrium, reenacting the Stillness prior to the Big Bang.”

The Seeker scratches their head. “Wait... I always thought, that this Grail was like some ancient artifact... Like some treasure that makes me rich...”

“It does make you rich. Rich in Spirit. The Collective Human Unconscious speaks to the individual through stories. Through Symbols and Motifs. If you know how to decode them, you will find that all human fiction carries hidden, spiritual meaning. Because our Myths and Legends, the ancient and the modern ones, don't just speak to the Human Mind, they also speak to the Human Soul.

When the Knight Galahad hunted after the Grail, he united the external Quest, represented by Yang with the inner Stillness of Ying. When Perceval set out to find the Grail, he first had to learn a lesson in compassion, uniting his masculine and feminine aspects of Self. The Quest for the Holy Grail is a Journey towards Wholeness. That's why it's called 'Holy' Grail. You see, the origin of the word 'Holy' is 'Whole'.

Regardless of Sex and Gender, each Person possess both Masculine and Feminine aspects. However Society has conditioned Man to repress the Anima and Woman to repress the Animus. This causes imbalance, suppression, depression, addiction. A man, who has not integrated his female aspects relies too much on his rationality, dismissing his emotions. A woman, who has not integrated her male aspects, relies too much on her emotions and too little on her rational mind.

To be whole, one needs to embody both aspects of Self, the Male and the Female. One needs to harmonize the energies of Giving and Receiving, of pouring out and taking in. Balancing both aspects releases a tremendous amount of energy, which would otherwise be spent on a never-ending inner conflict. One, who has harmonized and unified both aspects of Self is like a clear channel for higher Divine inspiration to be expressed in the physical world. This is the Holy Grail of Spirituality. It's completion. Unity with the Divine.”

“How do I get there?” asks the Seeker. “What do I need to do to reach completion? Where do I find this 'Holy Grail'?”

The Strangers eyebrows pull together. “Throughout the Centuries, many Seekers set out to find the Holy Grail, only to return empty handed. Many have tried, many have failed. Some have searched all their Life without ever finding. Asking the wrong questions, seeking in the wrong places. One Lifetime alone, may not be enough. Hundreds of Lifetimes, may not be enough. Even if you accept this Quest for the Holy Grail, there is no guarantee, that you will ever find it. The Grail will first test you, before it reveals itself to you. You will need to face many difficult challenges and prove yourself to be worthy. Are you committed to follow a trail of Breadcrumbs, leading you from one hint to the next? Solving Riddles, uncovering Mysteries and decoding ancient Secrets? Are you willing to pay the price for wholeness, even if it costs you everything?”

The Seeker sighs. “Creating that Red Stone already dragged on for way too long and now you expect me to pay my attention to the next 'Mythical Object Quest'? Can't we like just skip this part and move on to the Main Quest?”

“If you bypass the inner work, the same lesson will come up again, until it's learned. The Quest is there. You can avoid it or you can embrace it. How you approach the Quest is up to you. You can ignore it, you can run away from it. But even if you have completed all other Missions, this Quest will still be there. Waiting for you to be resolved. And the longer you wait to answer the Call, the Quest will become more difficult.”

The Seeker takes a deep breath. “Alright... Fine... I'll accept the Quest... Let's find that damned Grail.”

NEW MISSION STARTED:

The Quest for the Holy Grail

Up ahead, the Stranger spots a Human, sitting on an elevated platform. The Stranger pulls the reins, the white horse stops. Next to the dried up riverbed, there is a crumbling, wooden footbridge. On the pier sits an old man with a crown in royal garments. He holds a fishing rod, which dangles above the cracked, hardened mud. With a melancholic face, he puffs on a cigarette and sighs.

“Welcome fair friends. Come rest here, at my side. In the wasteland, where the rivers of Life have all dried up. Where the Grass has turned to dust. In this barren landscape, where the times of joy are long forgotten. Here in the desolate Solitude of the my forgotten Kingdom.”

INTRODUCING:

The Fisher King

The Strangers climb down from the Horse. The Seeker follows hesitantly. They stare at the Fisher on the Pier.

“You are aware, that you are fishing in Dust?” asks the Seeker skeptically.

The old man sighs. “You know... Even after my wound was healed, it wouldn't stop my aging. Nothing can stop the passage of time. Even when we cling to our memories, when we fish in dried up riverbeds. Not even the Grail in my hands could stop it. When I was dying, the Land was dying with me. But now the Land dies and I die along with it.”

“Wait!” interrupts the Seeker. “ You have the Grail? We are searching for this exact thing.”

The Fisher King takes out a Golden Chalice from a bag.

“What was that Gentleman's Name again?,” reminisces the Fisher King. “I think he was called Perry or something. A Polite fellow, I wonder what happened to him. He left the chalice to me. Everyday I drank with the chalice from the river of Life. But then the Water stopped to flow and once again the land turned desolate. The Rivers all dried up. The animals left the country. The Trees, the Grass, the Flowers all died off. The Rivers dried up, the Fish all died. Dead Birds fell from up above. Even the vultures avoid my Desolate wasteland. All Life abandoned my Kingdom. Now I am the last one left.”

The Fisher King Throws the Holy Grail into the Seeker's Hands. “Here take the Grail. I don't need it. It never served ME anyway. Even when I became the Grail King.”

The Seeker examines the Cup in their hands. “What?”

HOLY GRAIL OBTAINED

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED:

Level UP!

Level 65: +2 VIBES (93 V / 93 V)

“That ummm... That was surprisingly easy... Didn't you tell me something about this being a tough quest.”

“I am just as surprised as you,” gasps the Stranger. “I guess... If you already know that the Grail is within you, it saves you a lot of time.”

The old Fisher King points at the Chalice. “The Grail only unfolds it's true potential after you know the True Answer to the Grail Question. The Question is: Whom does the Grail serve? I always thought the Answer was, that is servers the Grail King. But I was wrong. It didn't serve me. I never found the True Answer. No matter what I did, The Grail would never fully bend to my Will.”

The Stranger looks around at the desolate landscape. “Say Fisher King, why exactly did the River of Life dry up?”

“I don't know,” sighs the Fisher King. “Many adventurers were seeking the Source of the River of Life, but no one has ever returned. I am the Guardian of this dying Land. I can't leave my Kingdom. Could you perhaps go and have a look for me?”

The Seeker hesitates for a moment.

“If I do accept the Quest, what will be my reward?” asks the Seeker.

“Why does everything need a reward? Can't you just do it for the sake of doing something good?” sighs the Fisher King.

“Anyway... If you take the Chalice to the holy tree and fill it with water directly from Source, it will give you a direct connection to Divine Inspiration. Channeled from the pool of infinity. It's from where Artists draw inspiration, it's from where Humans draw ideas. It's an Intelligence, present in all of us. An Intelligence that recognizes itself. And it's Love. Compassion for all beings. The interconnectedness within all things. I will now return to my Castle. If you make it back, you can visit me in Corbenic. Please bring me some of the water directly from the fountain.”

The Fisher King looks at the Seeker with trusting eyes.

“I... I will try my best...”

NEW QUEST STARTED:

The Source of the River of Life

* Follow the dried up River

The Seeker and the Stranger climb back on the Horse and wink goodbye to the Fisher King.

“Let us follow the dried up Stream,” suggests the Stranger. The Seeker nods.

Along the dead river, there is crumbling architecture, abandoned long ago. Ruins of Ancient Kingdoms, forgotten in time. Broken Statues and fallen Pillars. Palaces buried beneath Dust and Sand.

After some time of silently riding through deserted lands, following a never-ending, dried-up river bed, the Seeker examines the Holy Grail in their hand. The Seekers tongue touches their dry lips.

“How does this Grail work anyway? I am starting to get thirsty... I thought it was some overpowered magical item. Does it like fulfill wishes or something? I could really need a cold drink.”

“You need the correct Answer to the Grail Question,” responds the Stranger.

“Speak the right words to activate the Grail. The Chalice then instantly manifests Water from the infinite Source of Life into your Vessel.”

The Seeker takes a moment to think about the Grail question.

“Whom does the Grail Serve? It serves ME. Me, who holds the cup.”

Around 10 ML of Water manifest out of nowhere in the Seeker's cup. “What? Only this Little?!”

The Seeker sighs and gulps down the Liquid in one fell swoop. A warm sensation spreads through the Seekers body. Everything shakes and vibrates. Shivers from head to toe. The Seeker's face turns into a relaxed smile. An expression of Tranquility and contentment. Pure Bliss. The Seeker looks around with complete clarity in their gaze. The mesmerized Seeker stares in awe at the beauty of the world around them. After twelve infinity breaths, this state of being fades away and the Seeker returns to normalcy.

“More! I need more of this water! Whom does the Grail Serve? ME! It serves me! Clench my Thirst, Grail!”

Nothing happens. The Cup refuses to pour out holy water.

“Why doesn't it work? Does this ability have a cooldown time?”

“Until you have found the right answer to the Grail Question, the cup only gives you a fraction of what it can give,” explains the Stranger.

Along the way, there is an empty canvas and painting tools. Someone unconscious lies in the dried up river bed. The Stranger pulls the reins. The white steed stops. After closer inspection, the Seeker recognizes the person in need to be a Bird-of-Paradise. He looks malnourished.

“Are you okay?” asks the Seeker the half-dead Bird.

The colorful Bird mumbles something very quiet. He has a slow breath and a weak voice.

“Could you please repeat that again?” asks the Seeker and holds their ear to the Birds Beak.

“Inspiration,” utters the Bird woefully. “I need Inspiration. Please... I am a starving artist who is in dire need of inspiration.”

“Inspiration?” asks the Seeker confused.

“Yes...” responds the Bird-of-Paradise and coughs up blood. “No matter how much I follow the trends, my artwork always falls short... Inspiration is an artist's greatest asset. I may be the most skilled painter, but without proper inspiration, my Art will always be inadequate. I therefore came here to drink from the River of Life... I was hoping to find new inspiration. But the Water it's all gone... Woe is me, for I have become an artists greatest Nightmare. I have become Unoriginal.”

The Seeker takes out the Holy Grail. “Perhaps I can help you... Whom does the Grail serve? The Grail serves the starving artist.”

The Cup fills up 150 ML of water. The Seeker holds it at the Birds Beak.

“But please don't drink all of it. Leave some of the Water to...”

The Bird of Paradise slurps down the entire Liquid in one fell swoop.

“...Me,” sighs the Seeker.

The Bird licks his lips and burps. His face changes almost instantly. From tired, broken and hopeless to a bright, joyful and awake expression. His malnourished body is filled with Life. He takes his tools and starts painting on his canvas.

“That's it!” exclaims the Bird-of-Paradise excited. “Oh, how the Neurons explode in my brain. I have seen it in a vision behind closed eyes. The perfect image for my next painting. Something completely original. Unlike anything ever seen before. I will now create a masterpiece!”

The Bird is fully absorbed by his canvas, no longer paying any attention to the Seeker.

“You are welcome,” mumbles the Seeker and climbs on the Horseback. The Journey continues.

“So what exactly is this river of Life, you are constantly talking about?” asks the Seeker the Stranger, as they follow the track of the dried up river to its beginning.

“In Hinduism, there is the concept of Prana,” begins the Mysterious Stranger. “In Chinese traditional Medicine, they speak of Qi. In Kabbalah it's the Divine energy flowing from the infinite Ein Sof. In Alchemy they call it the 'Aqua Vitae', the water of Life. It's the vital Life-Force, that flows through all things like a river. If the Grail in your hands is a metaphorical representation of the energetic flow through your individualized system of being, then the river is synonymous with the universal Cosmic Flow of Life Force. The Grail relates to the Microcosm, the River of Life relates to the Macrocosm.”

“This sounds like some made-up nonsense. Can you back up your claim with science? Is there any empirical evidence that proves this 'energies' existence? Are there any successful experiments, that would measure this 'energy'? Or is your source just 'Trust me Bro'?”

The Stranger smirks. “Look, I am not here to convince you of anything. Neither am I trying to prove the validity of secret Knowledge to a world, that is not yet ready for it. All I can do is share what I know and it's up to you whether you find it worth pursuing or not. In the end, you need to experience it for yourself. You need to feel it in your body. The Energy. Tingling, vibrating, oscillating. The heat, the warmth. The wind when you absorb it. The pressure when you radiate it outwards. The spiritual chills and shivers flowing through your spine.

When you have advanced far enough on your own Spiritual Journey, you will come across practices, that focus on leveling up energetically. The more you sharpen your sensitivity to the energies around you, the more you become aware of them. At some point you may feel the Energy physically or, if your pineal gland is activated, you may even see the energy centers visually oscillating in the air.”

The white Horse suddenly stops. Again something blocks the path ahead. A Dolphin lies on the cracked, hardened mud-floor. She wears glasses. Her fins hold her head. There is a chalkboard, displaying complicated mathematics.

“It just doesn't make any sense,” mumbles the stressed out Dolphin. “No matter, how many times I go through this equation... I just can't understand it... It defies all Logic! It's giving me a headache!”

“Is there anything we can do for you?” asks the Seeker with concerned eyes.

""Yes, actually—if you could momentarily suspend the laws of mathematics, or perhaps convince this equation to solve itself out of pity, that’d be splendid. Otherwise, maybe just stand there and radiate confusion—it’s clearly working for you.""

The Seeker is speechless. They try to think of a good comeback but nothing comes to mind. The offended Seeker climbs back up on the Horse.

“Let's not waste any more time, Stranger. She clearly doesn't want our help...”

“The Future of our World depends on this Equation!” cries out the Dolphin. “If I could just understand this, it would solve so many Problems. All I need is some clarity!”

The Seeker sighs and gets back down from the Horse. “Whom does the Grail serve? It serves the Scientist.”

The Cup fills up around 100 ML. The Seeker offers the Chalice with Holy water to the Dolphin. “Here drink. This Water will give you some clarity.”

The Dolphin looks at the Cup with skepticism. She smells the Liquid. “What is this? Is it Coffee?”

“No, it's actually water from the--”

Before the Seeker finishes their sentence, the Dolphin has already emptied the Cup.

“--River of Life...”

The Dolphin has her eyes wide open. She wipes the board clean with a Sponge and starts to scribble new equations. “Why didn't I think about this sooner?! Of course! Now it all makes sense. After isolating celestial mechanics, cross-referencing orbital vectors, and—frankly—surpassing the intellectual limits of my contemporaries, I have arrived at a startling conclusion: the Earth... revolves around the Sun.”

The Seeker and the Stranger continue their journey, leaving the Dolphin-Scientist and her Chalkboard behind.

The scorching sun burns on the skin of the Seeker. Sweat drips from their forehead.

“I am getting real thirsty again... I wonder, if the Grail blesses me with water. Whom does the Grail serve? It serves ME.”

The Cup manifest Seven droplets of Holy Water. The disappointed Seeker sighs, takes the Grail and shakes it above their mouth. The single drops fall on the Seeker's dry tongue.

“The Fisher King was right... This Cup is useless!”

After several hours of riding, a large mountain with a flat top appears on the horizon. It's at the end of the dead River. A Gigantic mesa, as big as a small country. Almost 1,7 Kilometers High. The wide Cliff stretches over the entire horizon. The top of the elevated plateau is green, covered with grass and vegetation.

The Path ahead connects with three other dried-up canals into a pool. At the intersection of the four rivers stands a Gorilla below a streetlamp.

“Hey you,” shouts the Gorilla at the Strangers. The Horse stops.

“Do you have an idea for an app?”

“Umm... What?” asks the Seeker confused.

“All I need is just one clever business idea. Something about fitness. Something about sports. Something about Banana-Milkshakes. Something that gets me chicks. One good idea to make me rich. One good idea to prove to the world that I am more than just a simple Gorilla.”

The Seeker sighs. “Alright... I see... The next one, who wants to sip from my cup. Let's see how much water the Grail blesses you with. Whom does the Grail serve? The Grail serves the common people.”

The Chalice manifests 500 ml of Holy Water.

The Seeker clenches their teeth. 'What?! That dumb Gorilla get's this much?! This is unfair... I don't think it will make a big difference, if I take a small drip before giving it to the Gorilla.'

Just as the Seeker's lips are about to touch the Grail, the Gorilla pulls it out from their hands.

“Hey can I have a taste?”

The Gorilla gulps down 2/3 of the contents, wipes his mouth and returns the Cup with the remaining holy water.

“Thank you. I hope you don't mind. I am a Germaphobe.”

The eyes of the Gorilla lighten up. For a moment he is in awe. The Light Bulb of the streetlamp above suddenly turns on.

“I have the best idea ever. I will make a podcast and talk about stuff like psychedelics, spirituality and mysteries like Atlantis 'n stuff.”

The Seeker drinks the rest of the water, but spits it right out again. “Eww... This tastes awful. What happened to the holy water?”

“It wasn't meant for you,” responds the Stranger. “It spoils if you try to take it from another. Unless it's shared in Love, it will always leave a bitter taste. Just like Energy. Just like Attention. Only share in Love. Not in shallow politeness, not in regret, not in reluctance, not in expectation of any return.”

The Stranger points at the Great Mesa and asks the Gorilla: “Is this where the Tree of Life is hidden?”

“I don't know,” shrugs the Gorilla. “But the river of Life used to flow from up there all the way down. There was a great waterfall. But then the water stopped flowing and the land below turned dry.”

“How do we get up there?” asks the Stranger.

“There is a stair case etched into the stone. Right behind the waterfall. It's the 'Ten Thousand steps to Paradise'. I heard getting up there used to be impossible, when the water was still flowing. Now It's still difficult, but do-able.”

The Seeker and the Stranger pass the gorilla and walk through the dried lake basin. They stop at ancient steps, etched into the rock of the massive sandstone wall. The staircase is a masterwork of masonry.

“Don't you think it's unfair?” asks the Seeker, who struggles to keep up with the Strangers pace on the stairs. “I mean, I shared so much with Strangers and yet when I ask for some holy water, all I get are droplets. Why does the Grail only bless me with so little?”

“You still believe that the Grail serves an individual Person,” points out the Stranger, hopping effortlessly from one step to the next.

“It's your answer to the Grail Question that limits it's output. You need to find an answer, that breaks the limit. Manifest the Holy Water not with a fractured intent, but from a place of wholeness. Because if you share from a state of fragmentation, what you give will also be just as limited. You are not a person, sharing their energy with another person. You are the ONE, sharing Energy of the ONE with the ONE.”

After around three hours of walking upstairs, the Seeker and the Stranger finally arrive at the top of the platform.

NEW LOCATION DISCOVERED

Paradise

The exhausted Seeker breathes heavily and looks around. Lush fields of Grass and flowers. Flat land, many Kilometers wide. There are many small Trees spread out over the entire platform. Over the edge, a wall of dense, white clouds covers the land below.

In the corner of their eye, the Seeker spots something that looks like a large, green Hose, shining in the sun. It's as tall as a Tree. Neither the beginning, nor end of the structure are visible from where the Seeker stands.

The Stranger investigates the object. “Now I know what blocks the Flow of the River of Life.”

From up close, the Seeker sees that the Hose has scales. It breathes. They follow the direction of the Monsters head. After around Six-Hundred Meters of walking they arrive at a single, giant tree in a field of Grass and Flowers. The Tree has golden leafs and violet apples hanging from it. There are many puddles of clear water in the ground.

A never-ending source of the water of Life gushes out from a hole out the bark of the Tree. Like an eternal fountain. The Water fizzes out and lands directly in the open mouth of a giant Serpent, who drinks all the water. The Snake is around Six Meters High.

“What are you doing here?!” shouts the Stranger with a serious voice. His eyes are burning. He unsheathes his swords.

“You don't belong here! This water is not yours alone. It's to be shared with everyone. Your greed destroys the Kingdom. Don't you care about the people you hurt with your selfish actions?”

The Giant Serpent laughs. “Care? You think I care about anyone other than myself? No, this water is mine and mine alone. The only thing I care about is how to clench my endless thirst for more. More pleasure, more power, more possessions. I want everything and I won't stop until everything is mine.”

“I can't allow this to happen. Your selfishness obstructs the flow of the River of Life. People feel depressed, hopeless, sad and tired, because they are disconnected from their source. Your Greed blocks the channel of higher inspiration. It causes a lack of originality, a loss of creativity, a disconnect from spirit.”

The Seeker frowns after listening. “Wait... Are you telling me that he is the reason, why there are no new ideas? Is this why modern art and entertainment lacks meaning? Why all new movies are just hollow reboots? You Monster!”

“What are you gonna do about it?” laughs the twisted tongue mischievously. “You want to drink from Source? Only over my dead body! I am the biggest and strongest creature in this Garden. All who challenged me in the past have perished. You have no chance.”

The Seeker clenches their fist. “Are you the Reason why the 'Rings of Power' turned out to be such a disappointment? If you really are responsible, then it's now personal!”

The Stranger pulls back the Seeker and takes a step forward, standing protectively in front of them. “You are not ready to face such a challenge just yet. On the level down there perhaps. But up here, the challenge is mine. I need to fight the Serpent myself. Just as I respect your right to grow from your own challenges, I ask you to respect mine and not interfere in this battle.”

The Seeker nods. The Stranger takes a fighting stance. “This is your last chance! Go away, Now! Leave this place now peacefully or I will throw you out with force!”

The Giant Serpent laughs. “How cute... You really think you can---”

Suddenly the Serpent is taken by surprise, as the Stranger pulls down his hood and reveals his face. The Serpent hisses both out of fear and anger. Within the fracture of a Second, the Snake goes for a bite with his sharp fangs. But the Stranger blocks the teeth of the Beast with his swords.

“Well,” hisses the twisted tongue with a smirk. “Looks like you don't belong here either.”

The Serpent spews out a beam of water. The color of the water is tainted black. The Stranger dodges just in time.

“I know who you are,” shouts the Stranger. “I know what you represent. I see you, even when you hide yourself in a false light. Your reign ends now, your time is over.”

The Words of the Stranger burns in the air like fire. His Sword of Truth glows Blue. The left Sword glows red. He swings his swords against the Monster's neck. The Great Beast dodges.

“If you think Humanity stands any chance, you are deluding yourself. Humanity is far too lost. It's too late to change. There is no way.”

The Serpent attacks again with his fangs, the Stranger dodges, swings his swords and cuts the Monster's neck.

“There always is a way,” shouts the Stranger with burning eyes. His words ignite fire in the air.

The Serpent bleeds, his blood his black. “Nothing is permanent. Every house you build will fall apart. Everyone you know will die. Every Memory you cling to, will one day be forgotten. Everything you do is meaningless.”

“No,” grins the Stranger and swings his blue sword against the Monster's neck. “The world might be meaningless, but that's why I am here to create meaning.”

With a clean hit, the Stranger chops off the Serpents heavy head. The Beast is slain. The blocked Source is cleared. The Water of Life flows anew.

As the floodgates open, new water flows out of the Tree of Life all the way back to the edge of the mountain. Down at the bottom, the Gorilla stares in astonishment as the waterfall is fueled by a new wave of water. The water flows through the country. Wherever the wave of water flows, Life returns in the surrounding area. New grass, trees and flowers grow instantly wherever the water returns. The Dolphin welcomes the new wave and surfs on her chalkboard. The Bird-of-Paradise takes his completed artwork and views the river from above. In Corbenic, the hidden castle, the Fisher King get's up from his Throne to witness the return of the water of Life from his balcony.

Back at the mountain summit, the Seeker stares at the Tree from which an infinite source of holy water flows. The Seeker is captivated by the archetypal sight. It stirs something deep within the Seeker. The clouds at the edge of the Mesa create an eerie atmosphere.

“This reminds me of a vague dream... The Tree, the fountain of water... It all feels so familiar... Have I been here before?”

“Few people ever been here,” responds the Stranger. “I think Plato visited this place in a dream once. Then there was this one Celtic Druid who traveled here through the Astral Realm. A few Kabbalists, Sufis and Mystics also had visions of this place. Although it's not really a place. It's a unconscious representation of something primal, something ancient, something sacred. A memory deep ingrained in our collective consciousness. This is the Point where our world is projected like a hologram from Infinity. This is from where Reality is streamed.

Fill your Chalice with water directly from Source. Pure, unfiltered essence directly from the infinite Source of Life. Then ask the Grail Question directly to the Cup itself and drink its holy water. It will then reveal to you the true Answer to the great Question through visions and images.”

The Seeker approaches the Tree of Life and holds their cup in the source of the water of Life. When the Grail is full, the Seeker holds it up high above their head and asks:

“Whom does the Grail serve?”

The Seeker drinks from the Crystal clear water. The Seeker feels an overflow of Universal Love, a connection to the Source of Being. The Quietness of the Lucid Moment. A Moment in time between moments. When there is only Presence.

The Seeker feels a connection to all, that is. Awareness extends over all surroundings. Awareness of the Birds, of the Trees, of the Sky. And the Seeker recognizes themselves in all observations. The Seekers awareness extends over to all animals, to all beings on the world. It's as if the Seeker feels an influx of Memories and experiences. For one moment, the Seeker stares directly into the heart of infinity. The Unlimited from which the limited is projected. The Still-point of Infinity from where the Holy Water is spawned. And the Seeker is one with everything.

“Now I know the answer to the Grail question,” speaks the Seeker with burning eyes.

Suddenly a loud sounds grabs the Seeker's and the Strangers attention. Out of the Serpent's cut off neck, two new heads grow. A deadly wound, healed. “You really thought this would be enough to end me? No, it only made me stronger.”

From both heads the Serpent spews out Black, oily liquid. Corrupted water from the source. The Stranger dodges the first beam and pushes away the Seeker.

The Stranger takes a deep breath in, then he holds it and pushes out the breath. He exhales a burning orb through his mouth and lets it flow back through his nose, as it circles vertically like an infinity pattern in and out. After the Twelfth Breath, he takes in a last deep Breath, lets the energy flow down into his root Chakra, holds it and pulls it back up.

A new flame ignites in the Strangers eye. His Aura becomes visible like a flame around his body. A flame that gets stronger and stronger. The aura takes on a new form. The Form of a Mythical Beast. A Sphinx, a cherub, a winged Lion. Standing upright like a swordsman. Equipped with armor and with two swords mirroring the Stranger. The etheric form is a visible layer of blue, red and yellow energy patterns.

With his new form, the Stranger faces the giant two-headed Serpent. The wall of energy around the Stranger shields him from damage. The Sphinx strikes the Serpent with his sword. An epic battle ensues. The Serpent bites, chokes or shoots out Corrupted waters with two heads. The Stranger dodges the attacks when he is attentive and gets hit when he is distracted. The Stranger adapts. Learning from each hit. He maintains his attention even longer.

The Stranger enters flowstate. Every attack is countered with a swordstrike. Using the environment to his advantage. The Stranger pushes the Serpent ever closer to the edge of the Mesa, as he overwhelms the Beast, with his streak of fast sword strikes.

Driven into a corner, the Two-headed Serpent attacks the Stranger's Spirit Armor. The Stranger ignites both Swords, in red and blue flames. With one strong cut, he severs off both heads and the Serpent over the edge.

“You will regret this! I will Destroy you! Hear me?! I will make you pay.”

“You are banned from this place,” speaks the Stranger and watches over the serpents downfall.

As soon as the presence of the Snake is gone, the place lights up. A looming shadow that once threw shade on paradise is now banished. The River of Life flows again. Holy water streams down the waterfalls and splits in the valley below into Four Rivers.

“How do we get back down there?” asks the Seeker the Stranger.

“Easy,” grins the Stranger. “All we need is a boat that never sinks.”

The Stranger reveals a wooden boat behind a bush. The Seeker wonders where it suddenly came from. Together with the Seeker, they drag the boat into the water stream and enter it.

“You really sure this Boat will survive the waterfall?” questions the Seeker nervously.

“Be Love and no matter where you are on the river of Life, you will always flow in the right direction. Be Love when we fall over the cliff. Be Love when the boat hits the lakes surface. Be Love all the way through the process. Even during the scary moments.”

The Boat tips over the edge. Falling down 1.7 Kilometers. As they fall, the Seeker screams in fear of Death. The Stranger however laughs manically like a madman.

“Remember Seeker,” shouts the Stranger in the falling boat. “Be Love. Even Now!”

The Seeker takes in a deep breath and with burning eyes, the Seeker speaks: “Love is, when Fear is not!”

Suddenly, just before the boat hits the Lake, it stops mid-air, levitates for a moment above the water surface and then drops into the stream with little impact.

“What the hell did just happen?” asks the Seeker confused. “How are we still alive?”

“Didn't you know?” grins the Stranger. “This is a magical Boat.”

The Boat floats down the river stream. Wherever it flows, there is new nature blossoming. Trees with new life, Grass, Flowers, Insects, Birds, Animals. There is even fish in the water. Life has returned to a Land that was starving.

Along the River they see the Gorilla, the Dolphin and the Bird-of-Paradise. The Gorilla is now a famous Podcaster, the Scientist receives an award and the artist has his first exhibition.

The Boat floats for sometime along the river, until there appears a castle on the horizon. The Seeker and the Stranger tie the boat to a pier and enter into the castle.

NEW LOCATION DISCOVERED:

Corbenic

The Seeker walks with the Chalice in his hand to the Throne of the Fisher King.

“Have you found the True Answer to the Grail Question?” asks the elderly King.

“Yes,” affirms the Seeker with determination.

The King smirks. “Then whom does the Grail serve?”

“The Grail serves ALL,” responds the Seeker with a powerful voice. The Fire in their eyes glow up for a moment.

Holy water suddenly bubbles up in the cup out of nowhere and overflows the Grail. An infinite source of Water. Just like the Source of the River of Life, it won't stop flowing.

“You can have your Grail back,” speaks the Seeker and hands the overflowing Chalice to the King. “When I drank directly from Source, I felt how we are all connected. For a moment I saw through the eyes of All at once. All those Seekers out there. I looked into their heart and I realized, that they are all worth it. Even if they don't realize it about themselves. Every single one is worthy to drink from this water of Life. And it's only our own perceived unworthiness, that cuts us off from this eternal Stream of Life, that we desire so badly without even knowing it. I want this Grail to serve as many people as it can. I think it's better kept in your hands. So take it, as a King you...”

“Don't worry, you can keep it... I still have like a dozen Holy Grails left... Consider it a promotional gift. The Next one will cost you though. They are available in Five different colors.”

The Fisher King points at a corner where several Chalices are displayed on a cabinet. There are golden cups, silver cups, red cups, blue cups and black cups. Each Grail-version is shaped differently.

Mission Accomplished:

The Source of the River of Life

The Seeker and the Stranger leave the Castle and get back up on their white horse. They continue their journey through a land, where Life blossoms up anew. Where the rivers of Life flow again through once barren landscapes.

“If you want to learn a technique that helps you to perpetuate the flow of higher energy, you should look into the Infinity Breath technique,” speaks the Stranger, as he rides the horse through the .

“The Yogis have been using this technique to synchronize themselves with the flow of Divine Energy since ancient times. Through the Infinity Breath the River of Life flows through you. Unite the Microcosm and the Macrocosm within you, through your breath and tap into the vast storehouse of infinite energy. Master the infinity Breath and synchronize your energetic body to the flow of the River of Life.”

The Seeker has a question but suddenly something else catches their attention. A hot air balloon suddenly crashes right in front of their horse. The Shrinking bag covers four figures, who struggle against the deflated balloon.

Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan emerge from below the deflated balloon. It's the NEW-AGE-AWAKENED-RESISTANCE-TURTLES.

D'Artagnan grabs the Seeker's shoulder. “Seeker! It's time to wake up! You are trapped in a simulation!”

1kpvry6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1kpvry6/the_continuum/,The Continuum,"Hi everyone! I’m Micah, and this is the beginning of a sci-fi story I’ve been developing for a while. It’s a slow-burn mystery with emotional weight, grounded characters, and a touch of the surreal.

The story follows Eric Dandasan, a high school student who begins experiencing strange blackouts and visions. As the episodes worsen, he discovers he's caught in something far bigger — something tied to time, memory, and a universe he may not fully belong to.

If you're into:

Character-driven sci-fi

Gradual worldbuilding

Twists that grow with each chapter


…this might be up your alley.

I'll be posting chapters regularly, and I’d love feedback, theories, and reader thoughts as the story unfolds.

Thanks for reading — here’s Chapter One: The Headache.


Chapter One: The Headache 

The first bell echoed down the long, sunlit hallways of Gallatin High School, mingling with the scrape of lockers and the chatter of students easing into another day. Eric Dandasan shuffled into the building, his backpack slung low over one shoulder, eyes half-lidded against the bright Montana morning.

He passed clusters of kids swapping weekend stories, the scent of pine cleaner and cafeteria coffee hanging in the air. His own thoughts felt heavy, clouded by the dull throb behind his temples that had started the day before—and stubbornly refused to fade.

“Hey, Eric!” someone called.

Jamie, from his history class, waved near the lockers. She had that easy, magnetic grin that made the crowded halls feel a little less chaotic.

“Morning,” Eric replied, forcing a nod as he fell into step beside her.

“So,” Jamie said as they turned the corner, “ready for Alden’s quiz tomorrow?”

Eric shrugged, rubbing the side of his head. “I don’t even know if I’m gonna make it through today without passing out.”

Jamie gave him a sideways glance. “Rough weekend?”

“Not really. Just this headache that won’t quit.”

“Skipped breakfast again?”

“Maybe.” He tried to keep his tone light, but even his voice felt tired.

“Well,” she said, nudging him with her elbow, “if you need to copy my notes later, just say the word.”

He gave a faint smile. “Thanks. I might.”

The clock above the main entrance chimed again. They reached the door to Mr. Alden’s classroom, the low murmur of voices spilling out into the hall.

Jamie shot him a look. “Just survive until lunch.”

Eric nodded, touching the worn leather strap of his grandfather’s old watch—a small comfort in the swirl of movement and noise. “I’ll try.”

They stepped inside.

Scene Two: Algebra

The bell rang sharply, signaling the end of history class. Mr. Alden’s voice faded as students shuffled out, their footsteps echoing down the linoleum halls. Eric packed his notebook slowly, rubbing his temples where the dull ache had been creeping all morning.

“See you later, Eric,” Jamie called from the doorway, already laughing with a group of friends.

“Later,” he muttered, forcing a smile.

The hallway buzzed with the usual midday energy—lockers slamming, students laughing and weaving through crowds. Eric’s vision wavered for a moment as a sharper pulse throbbed behind his eyes.

He gripped the edge of his locker for balance, blinking hard to clear the fog.

“Hey, you okay?” a voice asked.

Eric looked up to see Jamie approaching again, concern knitting her brow.

“Just a headache,” he said, trying to sound casual. “It’s been bugging me all day.”

Jamie didn’t look convinced but nodded. “You should take it easy. Maybe hit the nurse if it gets worse.”

Eric shrugged, closing his locker. “I’ll be fine.”

They walked in silence for a few seconds before Eric added, “Thanks, though.”

Jamie gave a light nudge with her shoulder. “Just don’t pass out in Algebra. That class is brutal enough without someone face-planting in the middle of it.”

Eric managed a quiet laugh. “No promises.”

The bell rang again, and they slipped into their seats just as Ms. Carter began handing out worksheets. Her sharp eyes moved across the room, daring anyone to be unprepared.

Eric’s pencil hovered over the worksheet, but the numbers swam in front of his eyes. Ms. Carter’s voice droned on about factoring quadratic equations, but it barely registered.

He pressed his fingers to his temples again, trying to ease the pressure. The headache had sharpened into a steady throb, and now a faint metallic taste crept into his mouth.

The room felt warmer than usual. He glanced around—students were busy, some tapping pencils, others whispering answers. The fluorescent lights above flickered once, briefly casting the room in a sickly hue.

Jamie caught his eye and gave him a small, encouraging smile. Eric tried to return it but felt a sudden wave of nausea. He shifted in his seat, careful not to draw attention.

“Eric?” Ms. Carter’s voice cut through the fog. “Are you feeling alright?”

He blinked rapidly, swallowing hard. “Yeah, I’m fine,” he whispered, though the words felt heavy.

The throbbing behind his eyes pulsed faster, and he squeezed them shut for a moment, willing the pain away.

A sharp prickling sensation started at the back of his neck, crawling upward like tiny ants.

He opened his eyes just as a small drop of blood escaped his left nostril.

“Oh,” he murmured, reaching up to dab it quickly with a tissue.

Ms. Carter’s brows knitted together with concern as she approached. “Eric, maybe you should see the nurse.”

“I’ll be okay,” he insisted, but his voice betrayed him—shaky and weak.

Jamie stood, moving to his side. “Come on, let’s get you out of here.”

Eric hesitated but nodded, feeling the room tilt slightly as he stood.

The bell rang, signaling the end of class.

As they walked down the hall, Eric fought the urge to sit down right then and there.

Outside the classroom, the chatter of students faded into a low hum. He took a deep breath of the cool hallway air, the sharp sting in his nose lingering.

Jamie glanced at him, eyes wide. “You really should’ve told me sooner.”

Eric shook his head, trying to steady himself. “I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it.”

She frowned. “Sometimes it’s okay to slow down, Eric.”

He wanted to believe her.

The lunch bell blared and the hallway filled like a busted dam. Eric kept to the edges, skirting groups of students laughing too loud and moving too fast.

He wasn’t hungry. The ache in his head had spread—dull pressure behind his eyes and a weird stiffness in his neck. Like he was holding himself up wrong.

Jamie had peeled off after Algebra with a quick, “See you later,” and he hadn’t tried to follow. The cafeteria was too loud anyway, too bright. Instead, he drifted outside to a low stone wall behind the school commons, where the breeze still carried some of the morning’s chill.

From here, he could see the ridge lines in the distance, snow clinging to their shaded crests. Below them, half-built neighborhoods sprawled over what used to be his grandfather’s grazing fields. He used to ride out there on weekends with his dad before the land was sold off, one acre at a time.

Eric pulled out his phone and stared at the black screen, forgetting why he’d taken it out in the first place. He blinked. The pressure in his temples was sharp now, as if something inside his skull was expanding, just slightly—just enough to make him dizzy.

A strange memory surfaced. Not a real one—at least, it couldn’t be. He saw himself standing at the edge of a burning building, the smell of smoke thick in the air, sirens wailing. His hands were shaking.

Then it was gone.

He blinked again and looked around. The courtyard was just as it had been: noisy, teenagers moving in packs, football spiraling through the air. Nothing was on fire. His hands were fine.

But for a moment, he wasn’t sure.

He sat still for the rest of lunch, the sounds around him muffled, his body heavy. Something was off. He didn’t know what.

But it was getting harder to ignore.

Scene: The Library

Eric sat at the table in the library, the fluorescent lights above humming faintly, mixing with the soft rustle of pages and the occasional click of a keyboard. The monitor in front of him glowed dimly with a half-read Wikipedia article: Annexation of Texas. The text blurred slightly as he stared at it, unfocused.

He rubbed his temples with both hands. “Dammit,” he muttered under his breath, reaching for his backpack and fishing out a half-empty bottle of Advil.

As he unscrewed the cap, something caught his eye—the portrait of George Washington hanging above the bookshelf. It looked… wrong. The colors seemed too vivid, the eyes a little too watchful. Almost like the old man in the frame was studying him back.

Eric blinked and looked away, brushing it off. He shook two pills into his hand and popped them into his mouth, swallowing dry.

“Eric Dandasan!” a sharp voice cracked through the quiet.

He turned to see Mrs. Halvers, the school librarian, approaching with a disapproving glare and a cardigan pulled tight over her shoulders. “What did you just put in your mouth?”

Eric sat up straighter. “Just Advil, ma’am. I’ve got a headache.”

She stopped a few feet from his table, arms crossed. “You’re aware of the school’s medication policy. Hand them over.”

Eric hesitated, brow furrowed. “It’s just—”

And then it hit.

The pain wasn’t just behind his eyes anymore—it was inside them. A sudden pressure, sharp and electric, like something was trying to burst out from behind his forehead.

He gasped, gripping the edge of the table. Everything around him—the shelves, the portrait, Mrs. Halvers—wavered.

And then he heard it.

Screaming.

Not in the library.

In his head.

“ERIC!” a woman’s voice called out, desperate and terrified.

Fire. Blinding and furious. Smoke curled around him. Heat pressed against his face. The smell of burning plastic and scorched wood flooded his senses. Someone was calling his name from the flames.

“ERIC!”

His hands were shaking, and he couldn’t move. Couldn’t speak.

He blinked—

And the fire was gone.

So was the library.

He was sitting at a different desk now. Cooler air. A flickering projector cast diagrams on the whiteboard—labeled organs and vascular systems.

Laughter rippled around him.

His heart hammered in his chest.

“Eric,” came another voice, annoyed now. “I asked you a question.”

He turned, confused, and saw Mrs. Carson standing beside his desk, arms folded. The classroom around him came into focus. Biology. Fifth period.

What the hell?

“Mrs. Carson…” His voice was dry. “May I… may I be excused?”

She frowned, studying his face. “You don’t look well. Yes. Go.”

Eric stood on legs that didn’t feel like his. The bell hadn’t rung. He’d missed time—ninety minutes at least.

Eric stepped out into the hallway, the noise of the classroom fading behind him. The air felt colder here, and for a moment, he was just standing still, trying to catch his breath.

He looked down at his hands—slightly trembling. The lingering heat of that impossible fire still burned somewhere inside his mind, even though the hallway was quiet, empty.

He should feel relief. Instead, something tightened inside his chest. He didn’t belong here—not really.

He started walking, the dull headache now pulsing steadily. The school corridors stretched on, long and lifeless 

Eric arrived at the nurse’s office, a place he had never actually been before. The walls were pale and sterile, the scent of disinfectant hanging faintly in the air.

“Can I help you?” the nurse asked, looking up from her clipboard.

“Yeah, um… my head,” Eric said, pressing a palm to his temple. “I’ve got a headache.”

“Alright, lay down,” she said, motioning to the small cot tucked into the corner of the room.

Eric settled onto it, the paper sheet crinkling beneath him. The nurse moved beside him, gently wrapping a blood pressure cuff around his arm and checking his vitals—more out of protocol than concern. Everything read normal.

She gave a small sigh and a polite smile, likely chalking it up to another student looking for a break from class.

“Okay, get some rest,” she said, jotting something down on her clipboard. “I’ll inform your teachers. What’s your name, hon?” 

""Eric, ma'am. Eric Dandasan,"" he answered, his voice still groggy.

The nurse jotted it down on her clipboard. ""Alright, Eric. Just get some rest, dear,"" she said with a gentle smile.

Eric lay back on the cot, the room spinning slightly as he settled in. The sterile scent of rubbing alcohol and faint hum of fluorescent lights faded into the background. Before long, his eyes fluttered closed.

The sound of the final bell jolted him awake.

Eric sat up slowly, disoriented. ""How long was I asleep?""

""Just a few hours, dear,"" the nurse replied, straightening the papers on her desk. ""That was the final bell. Think you can make it home, or should I call your parents?""

He rubbed his eyes and nodded. ""I think I’ll be okay.""

Gathering his things, Eric stepped out of the nurse’s office and into the now-quiet hallway. A faint ache still pulsed at his temples. He moved slowly to his locker, the echo of his footsteps oddly sharp in the emptiness.

Opening it, he began switching out books, grabbing his backpack and slipping it over one shoulder. A wave of nausea hit him out of nowhere, forcing him to pause, one hand gripping the locker door for balance. He closed his eyes and waited for it to pass.

Maybe he should call his mom for a ride.

He pulled out his phone, thumb hovering over the screen… but after a moment, he slid it back into his pocket. His father wouldn’t approve. He’d say the walk would do him good.

With a resigned breath, Eric shut the locker and turned toward the front doors, steeling himself for the twenty-minute walk home—each step feeling just a little heavier than the last.

.

.

The Seeker and the Stranger ride on a white steed through a barren landscape. Lands of Savannah, desolate and empty. The Horse follows the trail of Dried up riverbeds. The sun burns on their skins.

“What exactly are we after?” asks the Seeker the Stranger, while wiping the sweat from their forehead.

“The Holy Grail,” responds the grinning Stranger.

“It's a symbol used in many stories, representing the unification of opposites. The Union of the Divine Male and Divine Feminine Aspects of Consciousness. It's a Merging of Order and Chaos, of Intelligence and Love, of rationality and creativity. By balancing out both Aspects of the Self. By Synchronizing both hemispheres of the brain. By ending all Dualities within, creating Peace between Logic and Love. A state of inner equilibrium, reenacting the Stillness prior to the Big Bang.”

The Seeker scratches their head. “Wait... I always thought, that this Grail was like some ancient artifact... Like some treasure that makes me rich...”

“It does make you rich. Rich in Spirit. The Collective Human Unconscious speaks to the individual through stories. Through Symbols and Motifs. If you know how to decode them, you will find that all human fiction carries hidden, spiritual meaning. Because our Myths and Legends, the ancient and the modern ones, don't just speak to the Human Mind, they also speak to the Human Soul.

When the Knight Galahad hunted after the Grail, he united the external Quest, represented by Yang with the inner Stillness of Ying. When Perceval set out to find the Grail, he first had to learn a lesson in compassion, uniting his masculine and feminine aspects of Self. The Quest for the Holy Grail is a Journey towards Wholeness. That's why it's called 'Holy' Grail. You see, the origin of the word 'Holy' is 'Whole'.

Regardless of Sex and Gender, each Person possess both Masculine and Feminine aspects. However Society has conditioned Man to repress the Anima and Woman to repress the Animus. This causes imbalance, suppression, depression, addiction. A man, who has not integrated his female aspects relies too much on his rationality, dismissing his emotions. A woman, who has not integrated her male aspects, relies too much on her emotions and too little on her rational mind.

To be whole, one needs to embody both aspects of Self, the Male and the Female. One needs to harmonize the energies of Giving and Receiving, of pouring out and taking in. Balancing both aspects releases a tremendous amount of energy, which would otherwise be spent on a never-ending inner conflict. One, who has harmonized and unified both aspects of Self is like a clear channel for higher Divine inspiration to be expressed in the physical world. This is the Holy Grail of Spirituality. It's completion. Unity with the Divine.”

“How do I get there?” asks the Seeker. “What do I need to do to reach completion? Where do I find this 'Holy Grail'?”

The Strangers eyebrows pull together. “Throughout the Centuries, many Seekers set out to find the Holy Grail, only to return empty handed. Many have tried, many have failed. Some have searched all their Life without ever finding. Asking the wrong questions, seeking in the wrong places. One Lifetime alone, may not be enough. Hundreds of Lifetimes, may not be enough. Even if you accept this Quest for the Holy Grail, there is no guarantee, that you will ever find it. The Grail will first test you, before it reveals itself to you. You will need to face many difficult challenges and prove yourself to be worthy. Are you committed to follow a trail of Breadcrumbs, leading you from one hint to the next? Solving Riddles, uncovering Mysteries and decoding ancient Secrets? Are you willing to pay the price for wholeness, even if it costs you everything?”

The Seeker sighs. “Creating that Red Stone already dragged on for way too long and now you expect me to pay my attention to the next 'Mythical Object Quest'? Can't we like just skip this part and move on to the Main Quest?”

“If you bypass the inner work, the same lesson will come up again, until it's learned. The Quest is there. You can avoid it or you can embrace it. How you approach the Quest is up to you. You can ignore it, you can run away from it. But even if you have completed all other Missions, this Quest will still be there. Waiting for you to be resolved. And the longer you wait to answer the Call, the Quest will become more difficult.”

The Seeker takes a deep breath. “Alright... Fine... I'll accept the Quest... Let's find that damned Grail.”

.

**.**

**NEW MISSION STARTED:**

**The Quest for the Holy Grail**

.

.

Up ahead, the Stranger spots a Human, sitting on an elevated platform. The Stranger pulls the reins, the white horse stops. Next to the dried up riverbed, there is a crumbling, wooden footbridge. On the pier sits an old man with a crown in royal garments. He holds a fishing rod, which dangles above the cracked, hardened mud. With a melancholic face, he puffs on a cigarette and sighs.

“Welcome fair friends. Come rest here, at my side. In the wasteland, where the rivers of Life have all dried up. Where the Grass has turned to dust. In this barren landscape, where the times of joy are long forgotten. Here in the desolate Solitude of the my forgotten Kingdom.”

.

.

**INTRODUCING:**

**.**

**The Fisher King**

.

.

The Strangers climb down from the Horse. The Seeker follows hesitantly. They stare at the Fisher on the Pier.

“You are aware, that you are fishing in Dust?” asks the Seeker skeptically.

The old man sighs. “You know... Even after my wound was healed, it wouldn't stop my aging. Nothing can stop the passage of time. Even when we cling to our memories, when we fish in dried up riverbeds. Not even the Grail in my hands could stop it. When I was dying, the Land was dying with me. But now the Land dies and I die along with it.”

“Wait!” interrupts the Seeker. “ You have the Grail? We are searching for this exact thing.”

The Fisher King takes out a Golden Chalice from a bag.

“What was that Gentleman's Name again?,” reminisces the Fisher King. “I think he was called Perry or something. A Polite fellow, I wonder what happened to him. He left the chalice to me. Everyday I drank with the chalice from the river of Life. But then the Water stopped to flow and once again the land turned desolate. The Rivers all dried up. The animals left the country. The Trees, the Grass, the Flowers all died off. The Rivers dried up, the Fish all died. Dead Birds fell from up above. Even the vultures avoid my Desolate wasteland. All Life abandoned my Kingdom. Now I am the last one left.”

The Fisher King Throws the Holy Grail into the Seeker's Hands. “Here take the Grail. I don't need it. It never served ME anyway. Even when I became the Grail King.”

The Seeker examines the Cup in their hands. “What?”

“That ummm... That was surprisingly easy... Didn't you tell me something about this being a tough quest.”

“I am just as surprised as you,” gasps the Stranger. “I guess... If you already know that the Grail is within you, it saves you a lot of time.”

The old Fisher King points at the Chalice. “The Grail only unfolds it's true potential after you know the True Answer to the Grail Question. The Question is: Whom does the Grail serve? I always thought the Answer was, that is servers the Grail King. But I was wrong. It didn't serve me. I never found the True Answer. No matter what I did, The Grail would never fully bend to my Will.”

The Stranger looks around at the desolate landscape. “Say Fisher King, why exactly did the River of Life dry up?”

“I don't know,” sighs the Fisher King. “Many adventurers were seeking the Source of the River of Life, but no one has ever returned. I am the Guardian of this dying Land. I can't leave my Kingdom. Could you perhaps go and have a look for me?”

The Seeker hesitates for a moment.

“If I do accept the Quest, what will be my reward?” asks the Seeker.

“Why does everything need a reward? Can't you just do it for the sake of doing something good?” sighs the Fisher King.

“Anyway... If you take the Chalice to the holy tree and fill it with water directly from Source, it will give you a direct connection to Divine Inspiration. Channeled from the pool of infinity. It's from where Artists draw inspiration, it's from where Humans draw ideas. It's an Intelligence, present in all of us. An Intelligence that recognizes itself. And it's Love. Compassion for all beings. The interconnectedness within all things. I will now return to my Castle. If you make it back, you can visit me in Corbenic. Please bring me some of the water directly from the fountain.”

The Fisher King looks at the Seeker with trusting eyes.

“I... I will try my best...”

.

.

**NEW QUEST STARTED:**

**The Source of the River of Life**

* **Follow the dried up River**

.

.

The Seeker and the Stranger climb back on the Horse and wink goodbye to the Fisher King.

“Let us follow the dried up Stream,” suggests the Stranger. The Seeker nods.

Along the dead river, there is crumbling architecture, abandoned long ago. Ruins of Ancient Kingdoms, forgotten in time. Broken Statues and fallen Pillars. Palaces buried beneath Dust and Sand.

After some time of silently riding through deserted lands, following a never-ending, dried-up river bed, the Seeker examines the Holy Grail in their hand. The Seekers tongue touches their dry lips.

“How does this Grail work anyway? I am starting to get thirsty... I thought it was some overpowered magical item. Does it like fulfill wishes or something? I could really need a cold drink.”

“You need the correct Answer to the Grail Question,” responds the Stranger.

“Speak the right words to activate the Grail. The Chalice then instantly manifests Water from the infinite Source of Life into your Vessel.”

The Seeker takes a moment to think about the Grail question.

“Whom does the Grail Serve? It serves ME. Me, who holds the cup.”

Around 10 ML of Water manifest out of nowhere in the Seeker's cup. “What? Only this Little?!”

The Seeker sighs and gulps down the Liquid in one fell swoop. A warm sensation spreads through the Seekers body. Everything shakes and vibrates. Shivers from head to toe. The Seeker's face turns into a relaxed smile. An expression of Tranquility and contentment. Pure Bliss. The Seeker looks around with complete clarity in their gaze. The mesmerized Seeker stares in awe at the beauty of the world around them. After twelve infinity breaths, this state of being fades away and the Seeker returns to normalcy.

“More! I need more of this water! Whom does the Grail Serve? ME! It serves me! Clench my Thirst, Grail!”

Nothing happens. The Cup refuses to pour out holy water.

“Why doesn't it work? Does this ability have a cooldown time?”

“Until you have found the right answer to the Grail Question, the cup only gives you a fraction of what it can give,” explains the Stranger.

Along the way, there is an empty canvas and painting tools. Someone unconscious lies in the dried up river bed. The Stranger pulls the reins. The white steed stops. After closer inspection, the Seeker recognizes the person in need to be a Bird-of-Paradise. He looks malnourished.

“Are you okay?” asks the Seeker the half-dead Bird.

The colorful Bird mumbles something very quiet. He has a slow breath and a weak voice.

“Could you please repeat that again?” asks the Seeker and holds their ear to the Birds Beak.

“Inspiration,” utters the Bird woefully. “I need Inspiration. Please... I am a starving artist who is in dire need of inspiration.”

“Inspiration?” asks the Seeker confused.

“Yes...” responds the Bird-of-Paradise and coughs up blood. “No matter how much I follow the trends, my artwork always falls short... Inspiration is an artist's greatest asset. I may be the most skilled painter, but without proper inspiration, my Art will always be inadequate. I therefore came here to drink from the River of Life... I was hoping to find new inspiration. But the Water it's all gone... Woe is me, for I have become an artists greatest Nightmare. I have become Unoriginal.”

The Seeker takes out the Holy Grail. “Perhaps I can help you... Whom does the Grail serve? The Grail serves the starving artist.”

The Cup fills up 150 ML of water. The Seeker holds it at the Birds Beak.

“But please don't drink all of it. Leave some of the Water to...”

The Bird of Paradise slurps down the entire Liquid in one fell swoop.

“...Me,” sighs the Seeker.

The Bird licks his lips and burps. His face changes almost instantly. From tired, broken and hopeless to a bright, joyful and awake expression. His malnourished body is filled with Life. He takes his tools and starts painting on his canvas.

“That's it!” exclaims the Bird-of-Paradise excited. “Oh, how the Neurons explode in my brain. I have seen it in a vision behind closed eyes. The perfect image for my next painting. Something completely original. Unlike anything ever seen before. I will now create a masterpiece!”

The Bird is fully absorbed by his canvas, no longer paying any attention to the Seeker.

“You are welcome,” mumbles the Seeker and climbs on the Horseback. The Journey continues.

“So what exactly is this river of Life, you are constantly talking about?” asks the Seeker the Stranger, as they follow the track of the dried up river to its beginning.

“In Hinduism, there is the concept of Prana,” begins the Mysterious Stranger. “In Chinese traditional Medicine, they speak of Qi. In Kabbalah it's the Divine energy flowing from the infinite Ein Sof. In Alchemy they call it the 'Aqua Vitae', the water of Life. It's the vital Life-Force, that flows through all things like a river. If the Grail in your hands is a metaphorical representation of the energetic flow through your individualized system of being, then the river is synonymous with the universal Cosmic Flow of Life Force. The Grail relates to the Microcosm, the River of Life relates to the Macrocosm.”

“This sounds like some made-up nonsense. Can you back up your claim with science? Is there any empirical evidence that proves this 'energies' existence? Are there any successful experiments, that would measure this 'energy'? Or is your source just 'Trust me Bro'?”

The Stranger smirks. “Look, I am not here to convince you of anything. Neither am I trying to prove the validity of secret Knowledge to a world, that is not yet ready for it. All I can do is share what I know and it's up to you whether you find it worth pursuing or not. In the end, you need to experience it for yourself. You need to feel it in your body. The Energy. Tingling, vibrating, oscillating. The heat, the warmth. The wind when you absorb it. The pressure when you radiate it outwards. The spiritual chills and shivers flowing through your spine.

When you have advanced far enough on your own Spiritual Journey, you will come across practices, that focus on leveling up energetically. The more you sharpen your sensitivity to the energies around you, the more you become aware of them. At some point you may feel the Energy physically or, if your pineal gland is activated, you may even see the energy centers visually oscillating in the air.”

The white Horse suddenly stops. Again something blocks the path ahead. A Dolphin lies on the cracked, hardened mud-floor. She wears glasses. Her fins hold her head. There is a chalkboard, displaying complicated mathematics.

“It just doesn't make any sense,” mumbles the stressed out Dolphin. “No matter, how many times I go through this equation... I just can't understand it... It defies all Logic! It's giving me a headache!”

“Is there anything we can do for you?” asks the Seeker with concerned eyes.

""Yes, actually—if you could momentarily suspend the laws of mathematics, or perhaps convince this equation to solve itself out of pity, that’d be splendid. Otherwise, maybe just stand there and radiate confusion—it’s clearly working for you.""

The Seeker is speechless. They try to think of a good comeback but nothing comes to mind. The offended Seeker climbs back up on the Horse.

“Let's not waste any more time, Stranger. She clearly doesn't want our help...”

“The Future of our World depends on this Equation!” cries out the Dolphin. “If I could just understand this, it would solve so many Problems. All I need is some clarity!”

The Seeker sighs and gets back down from the Horse. “Whom does the Grail serve? It serves the Scientist.”

The Cup fills up around 100 ML. The Seeker offers the Chalice with Holy water to the Dolphin. “Here drink. This Water will give you some clarity.”

The Dolphin looks at the Cup with skepticism. She smells the Liquid. “What is this? Is it Coffee?”

“No, it's actually water from the--”

Before the Seeker finishes their sentence, the Dolphin has already emptied the Cup.

“--River of Life...”

The Dolphin has her eyes wide open. She wipes the board clean with a Sponge and starts to scribble new equations. “Why didn't I think about this sooner?! Of course! Now it all makes sense. After isolating celestial mechanics, cross-referencing orbital vectors, and—frankly—surpassing the intellectual limits of my contemporaries, I have arrived at a startling conclusion: the Earth... revolves around the Sun.”

The Seeker and the Stranger continue their journey, leaving the Dolphin-Scientist and her Chalkboard behind.

The scorching sun burns on the skin of the Seeker. Sweat drips from their forehead.

“I am getting real thirsty again... I wonder, if the Grail blesses me with water. Whom does the Grail serve? It serves ME.”

The Cup manifest Seven droplets of Holy Water. The disappointed Seeker sighs, takes the Grail and shakes it above their mouth. The single drops fall on the Seeker's dry tongue.

“The Fisher King was right... This Cup is useless!”

After several hours of riding, a large mountain with a flat top appears on the horizon. It's at the end of the dead River. A Gigantic mesa, as big as a small country. Almost 1,7 Kilometers High. The wide Cliff stretches over the entire horizon. The top of the elevated plateau is green, covered with grass and vegetation.

The Path ahead connects with three other dried-up canals into a pool. At the intersection of the four rivers stands a Gorilla below a streetlamp.

“Hey you,” shouts the Gorilla at the Strangers. The Horse stops.

“Do you have an idea for an app?”

“Umm... What?” asks the Seeker confused.

“All I need is just one clever business idea. Something about fitness. Something about sports. Something about Banana-Milkshakes. Something that gets me chicks. One good idea to make me rich. One good idea to prove to the world that I am more than just a simple Gorilla.”

The Seeker sighs. “Alright... I see... The next one, who wants to sip from my cup. Let's see how much water the Grail blesses you with. Whom does the Grail serve? The Grail serves the common people.”

The Chalice manifests 500 ml of Holy Water.

The Seeker clenches their teeth. 'What?! That dumb Gorilla get's this much?! This is unfair... I don't think it will make a big difference, if I take a small drip before giving it to the Gorilla.'

Just as the Seeker's lips are about to touch the Grail, the Gorilla pulls it out from their hands.

“Hey can I have a taste?”

The Gorilla gulps down 2/3 of the contents, wipes his mouth and returns the Cup with the remaining holy water.

“Thank you. I hope you don't mind. I am a Germaphobe.”

The eyes of the Gorilla lighten up. For a moment he is in awe. The Light Bulb of the streetlamp above suddenly turns on.

“I have the best idea ever. I will make a podcast and talk about stuff like psychedelics, spirituality and mysteries like Atlantis 'n stuff.”

The Seeker drinks the rest of the water, but spits it right out again. “Eww... This tastes awful. What happened to the holy water?”

“It wasn't meant for you,” responds the Stranger. “It spoils if you try to take it from another. Unless it's shared in Love, it will always leave a bitter taste. Just like Energy. Just like Attention. Only share in Love. Not in shallow politeness, not in regret, not in reluctance, not in expectation of any return.”

The Stranger points at the Great Mesa and asks the Gorilla: “Is this where the Tree of Life is hidden?”

“I don't know,” shrugs the Gorilla. “But the river of Life used to flow from up there all the way down. There was a great waterfall. But then the water stopped flowing and the land below turned dry.”

“How do we get up there?” asks the Stranger.

“There is a stair case etched into the stone. Right behind the waterfall. It's the 'Ten Thousand steps to Paradise'. I heard getting up there used to be impossible, when the water was still flowing. Now It's still difficult, but do-able.”

The Seeker and the Stranger pass the gorilla and walk through the dried lake basin. They stop at ancient steps, etched into the rock of the massive sandstone wall. The staircase is a masterwork of masonry.

“Don't you think it's unfair?” asks the Seeker, who struggles to keep up with the Strangers pace on the stairs. “I mean, I shared so much with Strangers and yet when I ask for some holy water, all I get are droplets. Why does the Grail only bless me with so little?”

“You still believe that the Grail serves an individual Person,” points out the Stranger, hopping effortlessly from one step to the next.

“It's your answer to the Grail Question that limits it's output. You need to find an answer, that breaks the limit. Manifest the Holy Water not with a fractured intent, but from a place of wholeness. Because if you share from a state of fragmentation, what you give will also be just as limited. You are not a person, sharing their energy with another person. You are the ONE, sharing Energy of the ONE with the ONE.”

After around three hours of walking upstairs, the Seeker and the Stranger finally arrive at the top of the platform.

.

.

**NEW LOCATION DISCOVERED**

**Paradise**

.

The exhausted Seeker breathes heavily and looks around. Lush fields of Grass and flowers. Flat land, many Kilometers wide. There are many small Trees spread out over the entire platform. Over the edge, a wall of dense, white clouds covers the land below.

In the corner of their eye, the Seeker spots something that looks like a large, green Hose, shining in the sun. It's as tall as a Tree. Neither the beginning, nor end of the structure are visible from where the Seeker stands.

The Stranger investigates the object. “Now I know what blocks the Flow of the River of Life.”

From up close, the Seeker sees that the Hose has scales. It breathes. They follow the direction of the Monsters head. After around Six-Hundred Meters of walking they arrive at a single, giant tree in a field of Grass and Flowers. The Tree has golden leafs and violet apples hanging from it. There are many puddles of clear water in the ground.

A never-ending source of the water of Life gushes out from a hole out the bark of the Tree. Like an eternal fountain. The Water fizzes out and lands directly in the open mouth of a giant Serpent, who drinks all the water. The Snake is around Six Meters High.

“What are you doing here?!” shouts the Stranger with a serious voice. His eyes are burning. He unsheathes his swords.

“You don't belong here! This water is not yours alone. It's to be shared with everyone. Your greed destroys the Kingdom. Don't you care about the people you hurt with your selfish actions?”

The Giant Serpent laughs. “Care? You think I care about anyone other than myself? No, this water is mine and mine alone. The only thing I care about is how to clench my endless thirst for more. More pleasure, more power, more possessions. I want everything and I won't stop until everything is mine.”

“I can't allow this to happen. Your selfishness obstructs the flow of the River of Life. People feel depressed, hopeless, sad and tired, because they are disconnected from their source. Your Greed blocks the channel of higher inspiration. It causes a lack of originality, a loss of creativity, a disconnect from spirit.”

The Seeker frowns after listening. “Wait... Are you telling me that he is the reason, why there are no new ideas? Is this why modern art and entertainment lacks meaning? Why all new movies are just hollow reboots? You Monster!”

“What are you gonna do about it?” laughs the twisted tongue mischievously. “You want to drink from Source? Only over my dead body! I am the biggest and strongest creature in this Garden. All who challenged me in the past have perished. You have no chance.”

The Seeker clenches their fist. “Are you the Reason why the 'Rings of Power' turned out to be such a disappointment? If you really are responsible, then it's now personal!”

The Stranger pulls back the Seeker and takes a step forward, standing protectively in front of them. “You are not ready to face such a challenge just yet. On the level down there perhaps. But up here, the challenge is mine. I need to fight the Serpent myself. Just as I respect your right to grow from your own challenges, I ask you to respect mine and not interfere in this battle.”

The Seeker nods. The Stranger takes a fighting stance. “This is your last chance! Go away, Now! Leave this place now peacefully or I will throw you out with force!”

The Giant Serpent laughs. “How cute... You really think you can---”

Suddenly the Serpent is taken by surprise, as the Stranger pulls down his hood and reveals his face. The Serpent hisses both out of fear and anger. Within the fracture of a Second, the Snake goes for a bite with his sharp fangs. But the Stranger blocks the teeth of the Beast with his swords.

“Well,” hisses the twisted tongue with a smirk. “Looks like you don't belong here either.”

The Serpent spews out a beam of water. The color of the water is tainted black. The Stranger dodges just in time.

“I know who you are,” shouts the Stranger. “I know what you represent. I see you, even when you hide yourself in a false light. Your reign ends now, your time is over.”

The Words of the Stranger burns in the air like fire. His Sword of Truth glows Blue. The left Sword glows red. He swings his swords against the Monster's neck. The Great Beast dodges.

“If you think Humanity stands any chance, you are deluding yourself. Humanity is far too lost. It's too late to change. There is no way.”

The Serpent attacks again with his fangs, the Stranger dodges, swings his swords and cuts the Monster's neck.

“There always is a way,” shouts the Stranger with burning eyes. His words ignite fire in the air.

The Serpent bleeds, his blood his black. “Nothing is permanent. Every house you build will fall apart. Everyone you know will die. Every Memory you cling to, will one day be forgotten. Everything you do is meaningless.”

“No,” grins the Stranger and swings his blue sword against the Monster's neck. “The world might be meaningless, but that's why I am here to create meaning.”

With a clean hit, the Stranger chops off the Serpents heavy head. The Beast is slain. The blocked Source is cleared. The Water of Life flows anew.

As the floodgates open, new water flows out of the Tree of Life all the way back to the edge of the mountain. Down at the bottom, the Gorilla stares in astonishment as the waterfall is fueled by a new wave of water. The water flows through the country. Wherever the wave of water flows, Life returns in the surrounding area. New grass, trees and flowers grow instantly wherever the water returns. The Dolphin welcomes the new wave and surfs on her chalkboard. The Bird-of-Paradise takes his completed artwork and views the river from above. In Corbenic, the hidden castle, the Fisher King get's up from his Throne to witness the return of the water of Life from his balcony.

Back at the mountain summit, the Seeker stares at the Tree from which an infinite source of holy water flows. The Seeker is captivated by the archetypal sight. It stirs something deep within the Seeker. The clouds at the edge of the Mesa create an eerie atmosphere.

“This reminds me of a vague dream... The Tree, the fountain of water... It all feels so familiar... Have I been here before?”

“Few people ever been here,” responds the Stranger. “I think Plato visited this place in a dream once. Then there was this one Celtic Druid who traveled here through the Astral Realm. A few Kabbalists, Sufis and Mystics also had visions of this place. Although it's not really a place. It's a unconscious representation of something primal, something ancient, something sacred. A memory deep ingrained in our collective consciousness. This is the Point where our world is projected like a hologram from Infinity. This is from where Reality is streamed.

Fill your Chalice with water directly from Source. Pure, unfiltered essence directly from the infinite Source of Life. Then ask the Grail Question directly to the Cup itself and drink its holy water. It will then reveal to you the true Answer to the great Question through visions and images.”

The Seeker approaches the Tree of Life and holds their cup in the source of the water of Life. When the Grail is full, the Seeker holds it up high above their head and asks:

“Whom does the Grail serve?”

The Seeker drinks from the Crystal clear water. The Seeker feels an overflow of Universal Love, a connection to the Source of Being. The Quietness of the Lucid Moment. A Moment in time between moments. When there is only Presence.

The Seeker feels a connection to all, that is. Awareness extends over all surroundings. Awareness of the Birds, of the Trees, of the Sky. And the Seeker recognizes themselves in all observations. The Seekers awareness extends over to all animals, to all beings on the world. It's as if the Seeker feels an influx of Memories and experiences. For one moment, the Seeker stares directly into the heart of infinity. The Unlimited from which the limited is projected. The Still-point of Infinity from where the Holy Water is spawned. And the Seeker is one with everything.

“Now I know the answer to the Grail question,” speaks the Seeker with burning eyes.

Suddenly a loud sounds grabs the Seeker's and the Strangers attention. Out of the Serpent's cut off neck, two new heads grow. A deadly wound, healed. “You really thought this would be enough to end me? No, it only made me stronger.”

From both heads the Serpent spews out Black, oily liquid. Corrupted water from the source. The Stranger dodges the first beam and pushes away the Seeker.

The Stranger takes a deep breath in, then he holds it and pushes out the breath. He exhales a burning orb through his mouth and lets it flow back through his nose, as it circles vertically like an infinity pattern in and out. After the Twelfth Breath, he takes in a last deep Breath, lets the energy flow down into his root Chakra, holds it and pulls it back up.

A new flame ignites in the Strangers eye. His Aura becomes visible like a flame around his body. A flame that gets stronger and stronger. The aura takes on a new form. The Form of a Mythical Beast. A Sphinx, a cherub, a winged Lion. Standing upright like a swordsman. Equipped with armor and with two swords mirroring the Stranger. The etheric form is a visible layer of blue, red and yellow energy patterns.

With his new form, the Stranger faces the giant two-headed Serpent. The wall of energy around the Stranger shields him from damage. The Sphinx strikes the Serpent with his sword. An epic battle ensues. The Serpent bites, chokes or shoots out Corrupted waters with two heads. The Stranger dodges the attacks when he is attentive and gets hit when he is distracted. The Stranger adapts. Learning from each hit. He maintains his attention even longer.

The Stranger enters flowstate. Every attack is countered with a swordstrike. Using the environment to his advantage. The Stranger pushes the Serpent ever closer to the edge of the Mesa, as he overwhelms the Beast, with his streak of fast sword strikes.

Driven into a corner, the Two-headed Serpent attacks the Stranger's Spirit Armor. The Stranger ignites both Swords, in red and blue flames. With one strong cut, he severs off both heads and the Serpent over the edge.

“You will regret this! I will Destroy you! Hear me?! I will make you pay.”

“You are banned from this place,” speaks the Stranger and watches over the serpents downfall.

As soon as the presence of the Snake is gone, the place lights up. A looming shadow that once threw shade on paradise is now banished. The River of Life flows again. Holy water streams down the waterfalls and splits in the valley below into Four Rivers.

“How do we get back down there?” asks the Seeker the Stranger.

“Easy,” grins the Stranger. “All we need is a boat that never sinks.”

The Stranger reveals a wooden boat behind a bush. The Seeker wonders where it suddenly came from. Together with the Seeker, they drag the boat into the water stream and enter it.

“You really sure this Boat will survive the waterfall?” questions the Seeker nervously.

“Be Love and no matter where you are on the river of Life, you will always flow in the right direction. Be Love when we fall over the cliff. Be Love when the boat hits the lakes surface. Be Love all the way through the process. Even during the scary moments.”

The Boat tips over the edge. Falling down 1.7 Kilometers. As they fall, the Seeker screams in fear of Death. The Stranger however laughs manically like a madman.

“Remember Seeker,” shouts the Stranger in the falling boat. “Be Love. Even Now!”

The Seeker takes in a deep breath and with burning eyes, the Seeker speaks: “Love is, when Fear is not!”

Suddenly, just before the boat hits the Lake, it stops mid-air, levitates for a moment above the water surface and then drops into the stream with little impact.

“What the hell did just happen?” asks the Seeker confused. “How are we still alive?”

“Didn't you know?” grins the Stranger. “This is a magical Boat.”

The Boat floats down the river stream. Wherever it flows, there is new nature blossoming. Trees with new life, Grass, Flowers, Insects, Birds, Animals. There is even fish in the water. Life has returned to a Land that was starving.

Along the River they see the Gorilla, the Dolphin and the Bird-of-Paradise. The Gorilla is now a famous Podcaster, the Scientist receives an award and the artist has his first exhibition.

The Boat floats for sometime along the river, until there appears a castle on the horizon. The Seeker and the Stranger tie the boat to a pier and enter into the castle.

.

**NEW LOCATION DISCOVERED:**

**Corbenic**

.

.

The Seeker walks with the Chalice in his hand to the Throne of the Fisher King.

“Have you found the True Answer to the Grail Question?” asks the elderly King.

“Yes,” affirms the Seeker with determination.

The King smirks. “Then whom does the Grail serve?”

“The Grail serves ALL,” responds the Seeker with a powerful voice. The Fire in their eyes glow up for a moment.

Holy water suddenly bubbles up in the cup out of nowhere and overflows the Grail. An infinite source of Water. Just like the Source of the River of Life, it won't stop flowing.

“You can have your Grail back,” speaks the Seeker and hands the overflowing Chalice to the King. “When I drank directly from Source, I felt how we are all connected. For a moment I saw through the eyes of All at once. All those Seekers out there. I looked into their heart and I realized, that they are all worth it. Even if they don't realize it about themselves. Every single one is worthy to drink from this water of Life. And it's only our own perceived unworthiness, that cuts us off from this eternal Stream of Life, that we desire so badly without even knowing it. I want this Grail to serve as many people as it can. I think it's better kept in your hands. So take it, as a King you...”

“Don't worry, you can keep it... I still have like a dozen Holy Grails left... Consider it a promotional gift. The Next one will cost you though. They are available in Five different colors.”

The Fisher King points at a corner where several Chalices are displayed on a cabinet. There are golden cups, silver cups, red cups, blue cups and black cups. Each Grail-version is shaped differently.

.

**Mission Accomplished:**

**The Source of the River of Life**

.

The Seeker and the Stranger leave the Castle and get back up on their white horse. They continue their journey through a land, where Life blossoms up anew. Where the rivers of Life flow again through once barren landscapes.

“If you want to learn a technique that helps you to perpetuate the flow of higher energy, you should look into the Infinity Breath technique,” speaks the Stranger, as he rides the horse through the .

“The Yogis have been using this technique to synchronize themselves with the flow of Divine Energy since ancient times. Through the Infinity Breath the River of Life flows through you. Unite the Microcosm and the Macrocosm within you, through your breath and tap into the vast storehouse of infinite energy. Master the infinity Breath and synchronize your energetic body to the flow of the River of Life.”

The Seeker has a question but suddenly something else catches their attention. A hot air balloon suddenly crashes right in front of their horse. The Shrinking bag covers four figures, who struggle against the deflated balloon.

Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan emerge from below the deflated balloon. It's the **NEW-AGE-AWAKENED-RESISTANCE-TURTLES.**

D'Artagnan grabs the Seeker's shoulder. “Seeker! It's time to wake up! You are trapped in a simulation!”

The Seeker and the Stranger ride on a white steed through a barren landscape. Lands of Savannah, desolate and empty. The Horse follows the trail of Dried up riverbeds. The sun burns on their skins.

“What exactly are we after?” asks the Seeker the Stranger, while wiping the sweat from their forehead.

“The Holy Grail,” responds the grinning Stranger.

“It's a symbol used in many stories, representing the unification of opposites. The Union of the Divine Male and Divine Feminine Aspects of Consciousness. It's a Merging of Order and Chaos, of Intelligence and Love, of rationality and creativity. By balancing out both Aspects of the Self. By Synchronizing both hemispheres of the brain. By ending all Dualities within, creating Peace between Logic and Love. A state of inner equilibrium, reenacting the Stillness prior to the Big Bang.”

The Seeker scratches their head. “Wait... I always thought, that this Grail was like some ancient artifact... Like some treasure that makes me rich...”

“It does make you rich. Rich in Spirit. The Collective Human Unconscious speaks to the individual through stories. Through Symbols and Motifs. If you know how to decode them, you will find that all human fiction carries hidden, spiritual meaning. Because our Myths and Legends, the ancient and the modern ones, don't just speak to the Human Mind, they also speak to the Human Soul.

When the Knight Galahad hunted after the Grail, he united the external Quest, represented by Yang with the inner Stillness of Ying. When Perceval set out to find the Grail, he first had to learn a lesson in compassion, uniting his masculine and feminine aspects of Self. The Quest for the Holy Grail is a Journey towards Wholeness. That's why it's called 'Holy' Grail. You see, the origin of the word 'Holy' is 'Whole'.

Regardless of Sex and Gender, each Person possess both Masculine and Feminine aspects. However Society has conditioned Man to repress the Anima and Woman to repress the Animus. This causes imbalance, suppression, depression, addiction. A man, who has not integrated his female aspects relies too much on his rationality, dismissing his emotions. A woman, who has not integrated her male aspects, relies too much on her emotions and too little on her rational mind.

To be whole, one needs to embody both aspects of Self, the Male and the Female. One needs to harmonize the energies of Giving and Receiving, of pouring out and taking in. Balancing both aspects releases a tremendous amount of energy, which would otherwise be spent on a never-ending inner conflict. One, who has harmonized and unified both aspects of Self is like a clear channel for higher Divine inspiration to be expressed in the physical world. This is the Holy Grail of Spirituality. It's completion. Unity with the Divine.”

“How do I get there?” asks the Seeker. “What do I need to do to reach completion? Where do I find this 'Holy Grail'?”

The Strangers eyebrows pull together. “Throughout the Centuries, many Seekers set out to find the Holy Grail, only to return empty handed. Many have tried, many have failed. Some have searched all their Life without ever finding. Asking the wrong questions, seeking in the wrong places. One Lifetime alone, may not be enough. Hundreds of Lifetimes, may not be enough. Even if you accept this Quest for the Holy Grail, there is no guarantee, that you will ever find it. The Grail will first test you, before it reveals itself to you. You will need to face many difficult challenges and prove yourself to be worthy. Are you committed to follow a trail of Breadcrumbs, leading you from one hint to the next? Solving Riddles, uncovering Mysteries and decoding ancient Secrets? Are you willing to pay the price for wholeness, even if it costs you everything?”

The Seeker sighs. “Creating that Red Stone already dragged on for way too long and now you expect me to pay my attention to the next 'Mythical Object Quest'? Can't we like just skip this part and move on to the Main Quest?”

“If you bypass the inner work, the same lesson will come up again, until it's learned. The Quest is there. You can avoid it or you can embrace it. How you approach the Quest is up to you. You can ignore it, you can run away from it. But even if you have completed all other Missions, this Quest will still be there. Waiting for you to be resolved. And the longer you wait to answer the Call, the Quest will become more difficult.”

The Seeker takes a deep breath. “Alright... Fine... I'll accept the Quest... Let's find that damned Grail.”

**NEW MISSION STARTED:**

**The Quest for the Holy Grail**

.

.

Up ahead, the Stranger spots a Human, sitting on an elevated platform. The Stranger pulls the reins, the white horse stops. Next to the dried up riverbed, there is a crumbling, wooden footbridge. On the pier sits an old man with a crown in royal garments. He holds a fishing rod, which dangles above the cracked, hardened mud. With a melancholic face, he puffs on a cigarette and sighs.

“Welcome fair friends. Come rest here, at my side. In the wasteland, where the rivers of Life have all dried up. Where the Grass has turned to dust. In this barren landscape, where the times of joy are long forgotten. Here in the desolate Solitude of the my forgotten Kingdom.”

.

.

**INTRODUCING:**

**.**

**The Fisher King**

.

.

The Strangers climb down from the Horse. The Seeker follows hesitantly. They stare at the Fisher on the Pier.

“You are aware, that you are fishing in Dust?” asks the Seeker skeptically.

The old man sighs. “You know... Even after my wound was healed, it wouldn't stop my aging. Nothing can stop the passage of time. Even when we cling to our memories, when we fish in dried up riverbeds. Not even the Grail in my hands could stop it. When I was dying, the Land was dying with me. But now the Land dies and I die along with it.”

“Wait!” interrupts the Seeker. “ You have the Grail? We are searching for this exact thing.”

The Fisher King takes out a Golden Chalice from a bag.

“What was that Gentleman's Name again?,” reminisces the Fisher King. “I think he was called Perry or something. A Polite fellow, I wonder what happened to him. He left the chalice to me. Everyday I drank with the chalice from the river of Life. But then the Water stopped to flow and once again the land turned desolate. The Rivers all dried up. The animals left the country. The Trees, the Grass, the Flowers all died off. The Rivers dried up, the Fish all died. Dead Birds fell from up above. Even the vultures avoid my Desolate wasteland. All Life abandoned my Kingdom. Now I am the last one left.”

The Fisher King Throws the Holy Grail into the Seeker's Hands. “Here take the Grail. I don't need it. It never served ME anyway. Even when I became the Grail King.”

The Seeker examines the Cup in their hands. “What?”

“That ummm... That was surprisingly easy... Didn't you tell me something about this being a tough quest.”

“I am just as surprised as you,” gasps the Stranger. “I guess... If you already know that the Grail is within you, it saves you a lot of time.”

The old Fisher King points at the Chalice. “The Grail only unfolds it's true potential after you know the True Answer to the Grail Question. The Question is: Whom does the Grail serve? I always thought the Answer was, that is servers the Grail King. But I was wrong. It didn't serve me. I never found the True Answer. No matter what I did, The Grail would never fully bend to my Will.”

The Stranger looks around at the desolate landscape. “Say Fisher King, why exactly did the River of Life dry up?”

“I don't know,” sighs the Fisher King. “Many adventurers were seeking the Source of the River of Life, but no one has ever returned. I am the Guardian of this dying Land. I can't leave my Kingdom. Could you perhaps go and have a look for me?”

The Seeker hesitates for a moment.

“If I do accept the Quest, what will be my reward?” asks the Seeker.

“Why does everything need a reward? Can't you just do it for the sake of doing something good?” sighs the Fisher King.

“Anyway... If you take the Chalice to the holy tree and fill it with water directly from Source, it will give you a direct connection to Divine Inspiration. Channeled from the pool of infinity. It's from where Artists draw inspiration, it's from where Humans draw ideas. It's an Intelligence, present in all of us. An Intelligence that recognizes itself. And it's Love. Compassion for all beings. The interconnectedness within all things. I will now return to my Castle. If you make it back, you can visit me in Corbenic. Please bring me some of the water directly from the fountain.”

The Fisher King looks at the Seeker with trusting eyes.

“I... I will try my best...”

.

.

**NEW QUEST STARTED:**

**The Source of the River of Life**

* **Follow the dried up River**

.

.

The Seeker and the Stranger climb back on the Horse and wink goodbye to the Fisher King.

“Let us follow the dried up Stream,” suggests the Stranger. The Seeker nods.

Along the dead river, there is crumbling architecture, abandoned long ago. Ruins of Ancient Kingdoms, forgotten in time. Broken Statues and fallen Pillars. Palaces buried beneath Dust and Sand.

After some time of silently riding through deserted lands, following a never-ending, dried-up river bed, the Seeker examines the Holy Grail in their hand. The Seekers tongue touches their dry lips.

“How does this Grail work anyway? I am starting to get thirsty... I thought it was some overpowered magical item. Does it like fulfill wishes or something? I could really need a cold drink.”

“You need the correct Answer to the Grail Question,” responds the Stranger.

“Speak the right words to activate the Grail. The Chalice then instantly manifests Water from the infinite Source of Life into your Vessel.”

The Seeker takes a moment to think about the Grail question.

“Whom does the Grail Serve? It serves ME. Me, who holds the cup.”

Around 10 ML of Water manifest out of nowhere in the Seeker's cup. “What? Only this Little?!”

The Seeker sighs and gulps down the Liquid in one fell swoop. A warm sensation spreads through the Seekers body. Everything shakes and vibrates. Shivers from head to toe. The Seeker's face turns into a relaxed smile. An expression of Tranquility and contentment. Pure Bliss. The Seeker looks around with complete clarity in their gaze. The mesmerized Seeker stares in awe at the beauty of the world around them. After twelve infinity breaths, this state of being fades away and the Seeker returns to normalcy.

“More! I need more of this water! Whom does the Grail Serve? ME! It serves me! Clench my Thirst, Grail!”

Nothing happens. The Cup refuses to pour out holy water.

“Why doesn't it work? Does this ability have a cooldown time?”

“Until you have found the right answer to the Grail Question, the cup only gives you a fraction of what it can give,” explains the Stranger.

Along the way, there is an empty canvas and painting tools. Someone unconscious lies in the dried up river bed. The Stranger pulls the reins. The white steed stops. After closer inspection, the Seeker recognizes the person in need to be a Bird-of-Paradise. He looks malnourished.

“Are you okay?” asks the Seeker the half-dead Bird.

The colorful Bird mumbles something very quiet. He has a slow breath and a weak voice.

“Could you please repeat that again?” asks the Seeker and holds their ear to the Birds Beak.

“Inspiration,” utters the Bird woefully. “I need Inspiration. Please... I am a starving artist who is in dire need of inspiration.”

“Inspiration?” asks the Seeker confused.

“Yes...” responds the Bird-of-Paradise and coughs up blood. “No matter how much I follow the trends, my artwork always falls short... Inspiration is an artist's greatest asset. I may be the most skilled painter, but without proper inspiration, my Art will always be inadequate. I therefore came here to drink from the River of Life... I was hoping to find new inspiration. But the Water it's all gone... Woe is me, for I have become an artists greatest Nightmare. I have become Unoriginal.”

The Seeker takes out the Holy Grail. “Perhaps I can help you... Whom does the Grail serve? The Grail serves the starving artist.”

The Cup fills up 150 ML of water. The Seeker holds it at the Birds Beak.

“But please don't drink all of it. Leave some of the Water to...”

The Bird of Paradise slurps down the entire Liquid in one fell swoop.

“...Me,” sighs the Seeker.

The Bird licks his lips and burps. His face changes almost instantly. From tired, broken and hopeless to a bright, joyful and awake expression. His malnourished body is filled with Life. He takes his tools and starts painting on his canvas.

“That's it!” exclaims the Bird-of-Paradise excited. “Oh, how the Neurons explode in my brain. I have seen it in a vision behind closed eyes. The perfect image for my next painting. Something completely original. Unlike anything ever seen before. I will now create a masterpiece!”

The Bird is fully absorbed by his canvas, no longer paying any attention to the Seeker.

“You are welcome,” mumbles the Seeker and climbs on the Horseback. The Journey continues.

“So what exactly is this river of Life, you are constantly talking about?” asks the Seeker the Stranger, as they follow the track of the dried up river to its beginning.

“In Hinduism, there is the concept of Prana,” begins the Mysterious Stranger. “In Chinese traditional Medicine, they speak of Qi. In Kabbalah it's the Divine energy flowing from the infinite Ein Sof. In Alchemy they call it the 'Aqua Vitae', the water of Life. It's the vital Life-Force, that flows through all things like a river. If the Grail in your hands is a metaphorical representation of the energetic flow through your individualized system of being, then the river is synonymous with the universal Cosmic Flow of Life Force. The Grail relates to the Microcosm, the River of Life relates to the Macrocosm.”

“This sounds like some made-up nonsense. Can you back up your claim with science? Is there any empirical evidence that proves this 'energies' existence? Are there any successful experiments, that would measure this 'energy'? Or is your source just 'Trust me Bro'?”

The Stranger smirks. “Look, I am not here to convince you of anything. Neither am I trying to prove the validity of secret Knowledge to a world, that is not yet ready for it. All I can do is share what I know and it's up to you whether you find it worth pursuing or not. In the end, you need to experience it for yourself. You need to feel it in your body. The Energy. Tingling, vibrating, oscillating. The heat, the warmth. The wind when you absorb it. The pressure when you radiate it outwards. The spiritual chills and shivers flowing through your spine.

When you have advanced far enough on your own Spiritual Journey, you will come across practices, that focus on leveling up energetically. The more you sharpen your sensitivity to the energies around you, the more you become aware of them. At some point you may feel the Energy physically or, if your pineal gland is activated, you may even see the energy centers visually oscillating in the air.”

The white Horse suddenly stops. Again something blocks the path ahead. A Dolphin lies on the cracked, hardened mud-floor. She wears glasses. Her fins hold her head. There is a chalkboard, displaying complicated mathematics.

“It just doesn't make any sense,” mumbles the stressed out Dolphin. “No matter, how many times I go through this equation... I just can't understand it... It defies all Logic! It's giving me a headache!”

“Is there anything we can do for you?” asks the Seeker with concerned eyes.

""Yes, actually—if you could momentarily suspend the laws of mathematics, or perhaps convince this equation to solve itself out of pity, that’d be splendid. Otherwise, maybe just stand there and radiate confusion—it’s clearly working for you.""

The Seeker is speechless. They try to think of a good comeback but nothing comes to mind. The offended Seeker climbs back up on the Horse.

“Let's not waste any more time, Stranger. She clearly doesn't want our help...”

“The Future of our World depends on this Equation!” cries out the Dolphin. “If I could just understand this, it would solve so many Problems. All I need is some clarity!”

The Seeker sighs and gets back down from the Horse. “Whom does the Grail serve? It serves the Scientist.”

The Cup fills up around 100 ML. The Seeker offers the Chalice with Holy water to the Dolphin. “Here drink. This Water will give you some clarity.”

The Dolphin looks at the Cup with skepticism. She smells the Liquid. “What is this? Is it Coffee?”

“No, it's actually water from the--”

Before the Seeker finishes their sentence, the Dolphin has already emptied the Cup.

“--River of Life...”

The Dolphin has her eyes wide open. She wipes the board clean with a Sponge and starts to scribble new equations. “Why didn't I think about this sooner?! Of course! Now it all makes sense. After isolating celestial mechanics, cross-referencing orbital vectors, and—frankly—surpassing the intellectual limits of my contemporaries, I have arrived at a startling conclusion: the Earth... revolves around the Sun.”

The Seeker and the Stranger continue their journey, leaving the Dolphin-Scientist and her Chalkboard behind.

The scorching sun burns on the skin of the Seeker. Sweat drips from their forehead.

“I am getting real thirsty again... I wonder, if the Grail blesses me with water. Whom does the Grail serve? It serves ME.”

The Cup manifest Seven droplets of Holy Water. The disappointed Seeker sighs, takes the Grail and shakes it above their mouth. The single drops fall on the Seeker's dry tongue.

“The Fisher King was right... This Cup is useless!”

After several hours of riding, a large mountain with a flat top appears on the horizon. It's at the end of the dead River. A Gigantic mesa, as big as a small country. Almost 1,7 Kilometers High. The wide Cliff stretches over the entire horizon. The top of the elevated plateau is green, covered with grass and vegetation.

The Path ahead connects with three other dried-up canals into a pool. At the intersection of the four rivers stands a Gorilla below a streetlamp.

“Hey you,” shouts the Gorilla at the Strangers. The Horse stops.

“Do you have an idea for an app?”

“Umm... What?” asks the Seeker confused.

“All I need is just one clever business idea. Something about fitness. Something about sports. Something about Banana-Milkshakes. Something that gets me chicks. One good idea to make me rich. One good idea to prove to the world that I am more than just a simple Gorilla.”

The Seeker sighs. “Alright... I see... The next one, who wants to sip from my cup. Let's see how much water the Grail blesses you with. Whom does the Grail serve? The Grail serves the common people.”

The Chalice manifests 500 ml of Holy Water.

The Seeker clenches their teeth. 'What?! That dumb Gorilla get's this much?! This is unfair... I don't think it will make a big difference, if I take a small drip before giving it to the Gorilla.'

Just as the Seeker's lips are about to touch the Grail, the Gorilla pulls it out from their hands.

“Hey can I have a taste?”

The Gorilla gulps down 2/3 of the contents, wipes his mouth and returns the Cup with the remaining holy water.

“Thank you. I hope you don't mind. I am a Germaphobe.”

The eyes of the Gorilla lighten up. For a moment he is in awe. The Light Bulb of the streetlamp above suddenly turns on.

“I have the best idea ever. I will make a podcast and talk about stuff like psychedelics, spirituality and mysteries like Atlantis 'n stuff.”

The Seeker drinks the rest of the water, but spits it right out again. “Eww... This tastes awful. What happened to the holy water?”

“It wasn't meant for you,” responds the Stranger. “It spoils if you try to take it from another. Unless it's shared in Love, it will always leave a bitter taste. Just like Energy. Just like Attention. Only share in Love. Not in shallow politeness, not in regret, not in reluctance, not in expectation of any return.”

The Stranger points at the Great Mesa and asks the Gorilla: “Is this where the Tree of Life is hidden?”

“I don't know,” shrugs the Gorilla. “But the river of Life used to flow from up there all the way down. There was a great waterfall. But then the water stopped flowing and the land below turned dry.”

“How do we get up there?” asks the Stranger.

“There is a stair case etched into the stone. Right behind the waterfall. It's the 'Ten Thousand steps to Paradise'. I heard getting up there used to be impossible, when the water was still flowing. Now It's still difficult, but do-able.”

The Seeker and the Stranger pass the gorilla and walk through the dried lake basin. They stop at ancient steps, etched into the rock of the massive sandstone wall. The staircase is a masterwork of masonry.

“Don't you think it's unfair?” asks the Seeker, who struggles to keep up with the Strangers pace on the stairs. “I mean, I shared so much with Strangers and yet when I ask for some holy water, all I get are droplets. Why does the Grail only bless me with so little?”

“You still believe that the Grail serves an individual Person,” points out the Stranger, hopping effortlessly from one step to the next.

“It's your answer to the Grail Question that limits it's output. You need to find an answer, that breaks the limit. Manifest the Holy Water not with a fractured intent, but from a place of wholeness. Because if you share from a state of fragmentation, what you give will also be just as limited. You are not a person, sharing their energy with another person. You are the ONE, sharing Energy of the ONE with the ONE.”

After around three hours of walking upstairs, the Seeker and the Stranger finally arrive at the top of the platform.

.

.

**NEW LOCATION DISCOVERED**

**Paradise**

.

The exhausted Seeker breathes heavily and looks around. Lush fields of Grass and flowers. Flat land, many Kilometers wide. There are many small Trees spread out over the entire platform. Over the edge, a wall of dense, white clouds covers the land below.

In the corner of their eye, the Seeker spots something that looks like a large, green Hose, shining in the sun. It's as tall as a Tree. Neither the beginning, nor end of the structure are visible from where the Seeker stands.

The Stranger investigates the object. “Now I know what blocks the Flow of the River of Life.”

From up close, the Seeker sees that the Hose has scales. It breathes. They follow the direction of the Monsters head. After around Six-Hundred Meters of walking they arrive at a single, giant tree in a field of Grass and Flowers. The Tree has golden leafs and violet apples hanging from it. There are many puddles of clear water in the ground.

A never-ending source of the water of Life gushes out from a hole out the bark of the Tree. Like an eternal fountain. The Water fizzes out and lands directly in the open mouth of a giant Serpent, who drinks all the water. The Snake is around Six Meters High.

“What are you doing here?!” shouts the Stranger with a serious voice. His eyes are burning. He unsheathes his swords.

“You don't belong here! This water is not yours alone. It's to be shared with everyone. Your greed destroys the Kingdom. Don't you care about the people you hurt with your selfish actions?”

The Giant Serpent laughs. “Care? You think I care about anyone other than myself? No, this water is mine and mine alone. The only thing I care about is how to clench my endless thirst for more. More pleasure, more power, more possessions. I want everything and I won't stop until everything is mine.”

“I can't allow this to happen. Your selfishness obstructs the flow of the River of Life. People feel depressed, hopeless, sad and tired, because they are disconnected from their source. Your Greed blocks the channel of higher inspiration. It causes a lack of originality, a loss of creativity, a disconnect from spirit.”

The Seeker frowns after listening. “Wait... Are you telling me that he is the reason, why there are no new ideas? Is this why modern art and entertainment lacks meaning? Why all new movies are just hollow reboots? You Monster!”

“What are you gonna do about it?” laughs the twisted tongue mischievously. “You want to drink from Source? Only over my dead body! I am the biggest and strongest creature in this Garden. All who challenged me in the past have perished. You have no chance.”

The Seeker clenches their fist. “Are you the Reason why the 'Rings of Power' turned out to be such a disappointment? If you really are responsible, then it's now personal!”

The Stranger pulls back the Seeker and takes a step forward, standing protectively in front of them. “You are not ready to face such a challenge just yet. On the level down there perhaps. But up here, the challenge is mine. I need to fight the Serpent myself. Just as I respect your right to grow from your own challenges, I ask you to respect mine and not interfere in this battle.”

The Seeker nods. The Stranger takes a fighting stance. “This is your last chance! Go away, Now! Leave this place now peacefully or I will throw you out with force!”

The Giant Serpent laughs. “How cute... You really think you can---”

Suddenly the Serpent is taken by surprise, as the Stranger pulls down his hood and reveals his face. The Serpent hisses both out of fear and anger. Within the fracture of a Second, the Snake goes for a bite with his sharp fangs. But the Stranger blocks the teeth of the Beast with his swords.

“Well,” hisses the twisted tongue with a smirk. “Looks like you don't belong here either.”

The Serpent spews out a beam of water. The color of the water is tainted black. The Stranger dodges just in time.

“I know who you are,” shouts the Stranger. “I know what you represent. I see you, even when you hide yourself in a false light. Your reign ends now, your time is over.”

The Words of the Stranger burns in the air like fire. His Sword of Truth glows Blue. The left Sword glows red. He swings his swords against the Monster's neck. The Great Beast dodges.

“If you think Humanity stands any chance, you are deluding yourself. Humanity is far too lost. It's too late to change. There is no way.”

The Serpent attacks again with his fangs, the Stranger dodges, swings his swords and cuts the Monster's neck.

“There always is a way,” shouts the Stranger with burning eyes. His words ignite fire in the air.

The Serpent bleeds, his blood his black. “Nothing is permanent. Every house you build will fall apart. Everyone you know will die. Every Memory you cling to, will one day be forgotten. Everything you do is meaningless.”

“No,” grins the Stranger and swings his blue sword against the Monster's neck. “The world might be meaningless, but that's why I am here to create meaning.”

With a clean hit, the Stranger chops off the Serpents heavy head. The Beast is slain. The blocked Source is cleared. The Water of Life flows anew.

As the floodgates open, new water flows out of the Tree of Life all the way back to the edge of the mountain. Down at the bottom, the Gorilla stares in astonishment as the waterfall is fueled by a new wave of water. The water flows through the country. Wherever the wave of water flows, Life returns in the surrounding area. New grass, trees and flowers grow instantly wherever the water returns. The Dolphin welcomes the new wave and surfs on her chalkboard. The Bird-of-Paradise takes his completed artwork and views the river from above. In Corbenic, the hidden castle, the Fisher King get's up from his Throne to witness the return of the water of Life from his balcony.

Back at the mountain summit, the Seeker stares at the Tree from which an infinite source of holy water flows. The Seeker is captivated by the archetypal sight. It stirs something deep within the Seeker. The clouds at the edge of the Mesa create an eerie atmosphere.

“This reminds me of a vague dream... The Tree, the fountain of water... It all feels so familiar... Have I been here before?”

“Few people ever been here,” responds the Stranger. “I think Plato visited this place in a dream once. Then there was this one Celtic Druid who traveled here through the Astral Realm. A few Kabbalists, Sufis and Mystics also had visions of this place. Although it's not really a place. It's a unconscious representation of something primal, something ancient, something sacred. A memory deep ingrained in our collective consciousness. This is the Point where our world is projected like a hologram from Infinity. This is from where Reality is streamed.

Fill your Chalice with water directly from Source. Pure, unfiltered essence directly from the infinite Source of Life. Then ask the Grail Question directly to the Cup itself and drink its holy water. It will then reveal to you the true Answer to the great Question through visions and images.”

The Seeker approaches the Tree of Life and holds their cup in the source of the water of Life. When the Grail is full, the Seeker holds it up high above their head and asks:

“Whom does the Grail serve?”

The Seeker drinks from the Crystal clear water. The Seeker feels an overflow of Universal Love, a connection to the Source of Being. The Quietness of the Lucid Moment. A Moment in time between moments. When there is only Presence.

The Seeker feels a connection to all, that is. Awareness extends over all surroundings. Awareness of the Birds, of the Trees, of the Sky. And the Seeker recognizes themselves in all observations. The Seekers awareness extends over to all animals, to all beings on the world. It's as if the Seeker feels an influx of Memories and experiences. For one moment, the Seeker stares directly into the heart of infinity. The Unlimited from which the limited is projected. The Still-point of Infinity from where the Holy Water is spawned. And the Seeker is one with everything.

“Now I know the answer to the Grail question,” speaks the Seeker with burning eyes.

Suddenly a loud sounds grabs the Seeker's and the Strangers attention. Out of the Serpent's cut off neck, two new heads grow. A deadly wound, healed. “You really thought this would be enough to end me? No, it only made me stronger.”

From both heads the Serpent spews out Black, oily liquid. Corrupted water from the source. The Stranger dodges the first beam and pushes away the Seeker.

The Stranger takes a deep breath in, then he holds it and pushes out the breath. He exhales a burning orb through his mouth and lets it flow back through his nose, as it circles vertically like an infinity pattern in and out. After the Twelfth Breath, he takes in a last deep Breath, lets the energy flow down into his root Chakra, holds it and pulls it back up.

A new flame ignites in the Strangers eye. His Aura becomes visible like a flame around his body. A flame that gets stronger and stronger. The aura takes on a new form. The Form of a Mythical Beast. A Sphinx, a cherub, a winged Lion. Standing upright like a swordsman. Equipped with armor and with two swords mirroring the Stranger. The etheric form is a visible layer of blue, red and yellow energy patterns.

With his new form, the Stranger faces the giant two-headed Serpent. The wall of energy around the Stranger shields him from damage. The Sphinx strikes the Serpent with his sword. An epic battle ensues. The Serpent bites, chokes or shoots out Corrupted waters with two heads. The Stranger dodges the attacks when he is attentive and gets hit when he is distracted. The Stranger adapts. Learning from each hit. He maintains his attention even longer.

The Stranger enters flowstate. Every attack is countered with a swordstrike. Using the environment to his advantage. The Stranger pushes the Serpent ever closer to the edge of the Mesa, as he overwhelms the Beast, with his streak of fast sword strikes.

Driven into a corner, the Two-headed Serpent attacks the Stranger's Spirit Armor. The Stranger ignites both Swords, in red and blue flames. With one strong cut, he severs off both heads and the Serpent over the edge.

“You will regret this! I will Destroy you! Hear me?! I will make you pay.”

“You are banned from this place,” speaks the Stranger and watches over the serpents downfall.

As soon as the presence of the Snake is gone, the place lights up. A looming shadow that once threw shade on paradise is now banished. The River of Life flows again. Holy water streams down the waterfalls and splits in the valley below into Four Rivers.

“How do we get back down there?” asks the Seeker the Stranger.

“Easy,” grins the Stranger. “All we need is a boat that never sinks.”

The Stranger reveals a wooden boat behind a bush. The Seeker wonders where it suddenly came from. Together with the Seeker, they drag the boat into the water stream and enter it.

“You really sure this Boat will survive the waterfall?” questions the Seeker nervously.

“Be Love and no matter where you are on the river of Life, you will always flow in the right direction. Be Love when we fall over the cliff. Be Love when the boat hits the lakes surface. Be Love all the way through the process. Even during the scary moments.”

The Boat tips over the edge. Falling down 1.7 Kilometers. As they fall, the Seeker screams in fear of Death. The Stranger however laughs manically like a madman.

“Remember Seeker,” shouts the Stranger in the falling boat. “Be Love. Even Now!”

The Seeker takes in a deep breath and with burning eyes, the Seeker speaks: “Love is, when Fear is not!”

Suddenly, just before the boat hits the Lake, it stops mid-air, levitates for a moment above the water surface and then drops into the stream with little impact.

“What the hell did just happen?” asks the Seeker confused. “How are we still alive?”

“Didn't you know?” grins the Stranger. “This is a magical Boat.”

The Boat floats down the river stream. Wherever it flows, there is new nature blossoming. Trees with new life, Grass, Flowers, Insects, Birds, Animals. There is even fish in the water. Life has returned to a Land that was starving.

Along the River they see the Gorilla, the Dolphin and the Bird-of-Paradise. The Gorilla is now a famous Podcaster, the Scientist receives an award and the artist has his first exhibition.

The Boat floats for sometime along the river, until there appears a castle on the horizon. The Seeker and the Stranger tie the boat to a pier and enter into the castle.

**NEW LOCATION DISCOVERED:**

**Corbenic**

.

.

The Seeker walks with the Chalice in his hand to the Throne of the Fisher King.

“Have you found the True Answer to the Grail Question?” asks the elderly King.

“Yes,” affirms the Seeker with determination.

The King smirks. “Then whom does the Grail serve?”

“The Grail serves ALL,” responds the Seeker with a powerful voice. The Fire in their eyes glow up for a moment.

Holy water suddenly bubbles up in the cup out of nowhere and overflows the Grail. An infinite source of Water. Just like the Source of the River of Life, it won't stop flowing.

“You can have your Grail back,” speaks the Seeker and hands the overflowing Chalice to the King. “When I drank directly from Source, I felt how we are all connected. For a moment I saw through the eyes of All at once. All those Seekers out there. I looked into their heart and I realized, that they are all worth it. Even if they don't realize it about themselves. Every single one is worthy to drink from this water of Life. And it's only our own perceived unworthiness, that cuts us off from this eternal Stream of Life, that we desire so badly without even knowing it. I want this Grail to serve as many people as it can. I think it's better kept in your hands. So take it, as a King you...”

“Don't worry, you can keep it... I still have like a dozen Holy Grails left... Consider it a promotional gift. The Next one will cost you though. They are available in Five different colors.”

The Fisher King points at a corner where several Chalices are displayed on a cabinet. There are golden cups, silver cups, red cups, blue cups and black cups. Each Grail-version is shaped differently.

.

**Mission Accomplished:**

**The Source of the River of Life**

.

The Seeker and the Stranger leave the Castle and get back up on their white horse. They continue their journey through a land, where Life blossoms up anew. Where the rivers of Life flow again through once barren landscapes.

“If you want to learn a technique that helps you to perpetuate the flow of higher energy, you should look into the Infinity Breath technique,” speaks the Stranger, as he rides the horse through the .

“The Yogis have been using this technique to synchronize themselves with the flow of Divine Energy since ancient times. Through the Infinity Breath the River of Life flows through you. Unite the Microcosm and the Macrocosm within you, through your breath and tap into the vast storehouse of infinite energy. Master the infinity Breath and synchronize your energetic body to the flow of the River of Life.”

The Seeker has a question but suddenly something else catches their attention. A hot air balloon suddenly crashes right in front of their horse. The Shrinking bag covers four figures, who struggle against the deflated balloon.

Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan emerge from below the deflated balloon. It's the **NEW-AGE-AWAKENED-RESISTANCE-TURTLES.**

D'Artagnan grabs the Seeker's shoulder. “Seeker! It's time to wake up! You are trapped in a simulation!”

1kpvly6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1kpvly6/panic_attacks_and_daily_life/,Panic attacks and daily life,"Hello, 42 yr old male here, I've had anxiety my whole life with my first panic attack with weed at about 17. I started getting panic attacks almost every time I smoked weed, so i eventually stopped. But that was my only trigger then,  now I seem to get panic attacks about 3 times a week for years roughly. Seemed to start after I got covid and after my best friend died. Then my uncle had two massive heart attacks and lived,  but ever since, I've been obsessed with my heart rate and how hard it beats. I quit vaping,  drinking alcohol for 3 years now, no weed, i drink coffee daily. About half a cup a day. I've been working out about 3 to 4 days a week and it helps,  but triggers panic attacks too. I just had one after my workout,  and I thought working out is supposed to help?? I also get a very rapid heart rate in the movies now for some odd reason. And I've had a few panic attaks while watching it, it's not the type of movie either. This happened in a Disney movie so I don't know why that's happening too? It's all so frustrating,  I hate the panic attacks, the pounding heart and numb hands when it happens. I just want my life back.... thank you ",1,1747605412.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False
1kpvlxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/valvereplacement/comments/1kpvlxx/my_surgery_post_10/,My Surgery Post 10,"10 days post-op and here's what happened to me - hope it helps prepare at least one other person (m60)

Prep was easy - no issues and I was in a good spot with all my relationships.

Waking was tough: I hated the tube and we didn't know my wife could stay. I wasn't in pain but felt gagging and was counting the minutes

ICU: This part was tough for me. I had a small bout of Afib, some elevation in my troponin levels and had to stay an extra day. I felt really nauseous and was shivering cold. My first night I woke in a total panic - I should have gone mechanical (can't do this again), I can't move, I'm in pain etc.  It wasn't until my second night that my nurse, Jim, really helped me by having me brush my teeth and giving me warm blankets (I was shivering). I was able to stand, although shaking, and get through the night. I should have had iPad or phone when I woke. And my back was killing me. Getting the drainage tubes out sucked, but less than keeping them in. 

Step Down: Even though I have coverage, I was in a room with 3 people (it's a busy ward). I slept really poorly (back) and would alternate between chair and bed. My wife would bring me real fruit etc so I was never constipated like some. 

Walking: started walking in hospital and it was initially with walker. After a few trips, assisted then unassisted. I had no problem. Motto- go in strong. I was a daily runner for 30 years, stopping only 6 weeks prior to surgery. Cardiac nurse said I could walk faster and farther than the plan. I think this helps. I am up to 5 walks a day - most short inside and my outside one today was 1.5K in 19 min. I am adding 1-2 mins a day to the outside walk 

Pain: stopped when I could, the major stuff. I have a high pain threshold so it's not bad for me. I take a couple Tylenol before bed mostly for back and hoping to sleep.

Mobility: If you can get in and out of low chairs without using your arms pre-surgery, it should be okay. I have zero issue with mobility. Didn't need a power-recliner, shower-chair etc

Limitations: I am mindful of the nothing more than 5 pound limit. It's hard bc I can easily lift my arms up over my head to grab a cup, the coffee, change an over-sized tee etc. I am trying hard not to overstretch bc then I can feel the chest wound. I can reach behind no issues either

Concerns: The back and sleep (I so want a good 8 hours). The wound - keep checking when I shower; the bond / tape should come off soon and I don't want an infection. My leg hurts a bit (had a graft) but okay. Also concerned I will bored. Attention span is short now, but hoping that gets better.

Long-term: It's going to be months before I get my life back, running, cycling, gym etc. I wonder if I will ever feel strong again and relaxed. I am striving for 1% improvement each day so by Aug. I can look back over my shoulder and give thanks",3,1747605412.0,valvereplacement,0,1.0,False

.

.

The Seeker and the Stranger ride on a white steed through a barren landscape. Lands of Savannah, desolate and empty. The Horse follows the trail of Dried up riverbeds. The sun burns on their skins.

“What exactly are we after?” asks the Seeker the Stranger, while wiping the sweat from their forehead.

“The Holy Grail,” responds the grinning Stranger.

“It's a symbol used in many stories, representing the unification of opposites. The Union of the Divine Male and Divine Feminine Aspects of Consciousness. It's a Merging of Order and Chaos, of Intelligence and Love, of rationality and creativity. By balancing out both Aspects of the Self. By Synchronizing both hemispheres of the brain. By ending all Dualities within, creating Peace between Logic and Love. A state of inner equilibrium, reenacting the Stillness prior to the Big Bang.”

The Seeker scratches their head. “Wait... I always thought, that this Grail was like some ancient artifact... Like some treasure that makes me rich...”

“It does make you rich. Rich in Spirit. The Collective Human Unconscious speaks to the individual through stories. Through Symbols and Motifs. If you know how to decode them, you will find that all human fiction carries hidden, spiritual meaning. Because our Myths and Legends, the ancient and the modern ones, don't just speak to the Human Mind, they also speak to the Human Soul.

When the Knight Galahad hunted after the Grail, he united the external Quest, represented by Yang with the inner Stillness of Ying. When Perceval set out to find the Grail, he first had to learn a lesson in compassion, uniting his masculine and feminine aspects of Self. The Quest for the Holy Grail is a Journey towards Wholeness. That's why it's called 'Holy' Grail. You see, the origin of the word 'Holy' is 'Whole'.

Regardless of Sex and Gender, each Person possess both Masculine and Feminine aspects. However Society has conditioned Man to repress the Anima and Woman to repress the Animus. This causes imbalance, suppression, depression, addiction. A man, who has not integrated his female aspects relies too much on his rationality, dismissing his emotions. A woman, who has not integrated her male aspects, relies too much on her emotions and too little on her rational mind.

To be whole, one needs to embody both aspects of Self, the Male and the Female. One needs to harmonize the energies of Giving and Receiving, of pouring out and taking in. Balancing both aspects releases a tremendous amount of energy, which would otherwise be spent on a never-ending inner conflict. One, who has harmonized and unified both aspects of Self is like a clear channel for higher Divine inspiration to be expressed in the physical world. This is the Holy Grail of Spirituality. It's completion. Unity with the Divine.”

“How do I get there?” asks the Seeker. “What do I need to do to reach completion? Where do I find this 'Holy Grail'?”

The Strangers eyebrows pull together. “Throughout the Centuries, many Seekers set out to find the Holy Grail, only to return empty handed. Many have tried, many have failed. Some have searched all their Life without ever finding. Asking the wrong questions, seeking in the wrong places. One Lifetime alone, may not be enough. Hundreds of Lifetimes, may not be enough. Even if you accept this Quest for the Holy Grail, there is no guarantee, that you will ever find it. The Grail will first test you, before it reveals itself to you. You will need to face many difficult challenges and prove yourself to be worthy. Are you committed to follow a trail of Breadcrumbs, leading you from one hint to the next? Solving Riddles, uncovering Mysteries and decoding ancient Secrets? Are you willing to pay the price for wholeness, even if it costs you everything?”

The Seeker sighs. “Creating that Red Stone already dragged on for way too long and now you expect me to pay my attention to the next 'Mythical Object Quest'? Can't we like just skip this part and move on to the Main Quest?”

“If you bypass the inner work, the same lesson will come up again, until it's learned. The Quest is there. You can avoid it or you can embrace it. How you approach the Quest is up to you. You can ignore it, you can run away from it. But even if you have completed all other Missions, this Quest will still be there. Waiting for you to be resolved. And the longer you wait to answer the Call, the Quest will become more difficult.”

The Seeker takes a deep breath. “Alright... Fine... I'll accept the Quest... Let's find that damned Grail.”

**NEW MISSION STARTED:**

**The Quest for the Holy Grail**

.

Up ahead, the Stranger spots a Human, sitting on an elevated platform. The Stranger pulls the reins, the white horse stops. Next to the dried up riverbed, there is a crumbling, wooden footbridge. On the pier sits an old man with a crown in royal garments. He holds a fishing rod, which dangles above the cracked, hardened mud. With a melancholic face, he puffs on a cigarette and sighs.

“Welcome fair friends. Come rest here, at my side. In the wasteland, where the rivers of Life have all dried up. Where the Grass has turned to dust. In this barren landscape, where the times of joy are long forgotten. Here in the desolate Solitude of the my forgotten Kingdom.”

.

.

**INTRODUCING:**

**.**

**The Fisher King**

.

.

The Strangers climb down from the Horse. The Seeker follows hesitantly. They stare at the Fisher on the Pier.

“You are aware, that you are fishing in Dust?” asks the Seeker skeptically.

The old man sighs. “You know... Even after my wound was healed, it wouldn't stop my aging. Nothing can stop the passage of time. Even when we cling to our memories, when we fish in dried up riverbeds. Not even the Grail in my hands could stop it. When I was dying, the Land was dying with me. But now the Land dies and I die along with it.”

“Wait!” interrupts the Seeker. “ You have the Grail? We are searching for this exact thing.”

The Fisher King takes out a Golden Chalice from a bag.

“What was that Gentleman's Name again?,” reminisces the Fisher King. “I think he was called Perry or something. A Polite fellow, I wonder what happened to him. He left the chalice to me. Everyday I drank with the chalice from the river of Life. But then the Water stopped to flow and once again the land turned desolate. The Rivers all dried up. The animals left the country. The Trees, the Grass, the Flowers all died off. The Rivers dried up, the Fish all died. Dead Birds fell from up above. Even the vultures avoid my Desolate wasteland. All Life abandoned my Kingdom. Now I am the last one left.”

The Fisher King Throws the Holy Grail into the Seeker's Hands. “Here take the Grail. I don't need it. It never served ME anyway. Even when I became the Grail King.”

The Seeker examines the Cup in their hands. “What?”

“That ummm... That was surprisingly easy... Didn't you tell me something about this being a tough quest.”

“I am just as surprised as you,” gasps the Stranger. “I guess... If you already know that the Grail is within you, it saves you a lot of time.”

The old Fisher King points at the Chalice. “The Grail only unfolds it's true potential after you know the True Answer to the Grail Question. The Question is: Whom does the Grail serve? I always thought the Answer was, that is servers the Grail King. But I was wrong. It didn't serve me. I never found the True Answer. No matter what I did, The Grail would never fully bend to my Will.”

The Stranger looks around at the desolate landscape. “Say Fisher King, why exactly did the River of Life dry up?”

“I don't know,” sighs the Fisher King. “Many adventurers were seeking the Source of the River of Life, but no one has ever returned. I am the Guardian of this dying Land. I can't leave my Kingdom. Could you perhaps go and have a look for me?”

The Seeker hesitates for a moment.

“If I do accept the Quest, what will be my reward?” asks the Seeker.

“Why does everything need a reward? Can't you just do it for the sake of doing something good?” sighs the Fisher King.

“Anyway... If you take the Chalice to the holy tree and fill it with water directly from Source, it will give you a direct connection to Divine Inspiration. Channeled from the pool of infinity. It's from where Artists draw inspiration, it's from where Humans draw ideas. It's an Intelligence, present in all of us. An Intelligence that recognizes itself. And it's Love. Compassion for all beings. The interconnectedness within all things. I will now return to my Castle. If you make it back, you can visit me in Corbenic. Please bring me some of the water directly from the fountain.”

The Fisher King looks at the Seeker with trusting eyes.

“I... I will try my best...”

.

.

**NEW QUEST STARTED:**

**The Source of the River of Life**

* **Follow the dried up River**

.

.

The Seeker and the Stranger climb back on the Horse and wink goodbye to the Fisher King.

“Let us follow the dried up Stream,” suggests the Stranger. The Seeker nods.

Along the dead river, there is crumbling architecture, abandoned long ago. Ruins of Ancient Kingdoms, forgotten in time. Broken Statues and fallen Pillars. Palaces buried beneath Dust and Sand.

After some time of silently riding through deserted lands, following a never-ending, dried-up river bed, the Seeker examines the Holy Grail in their hand. The Seekers tongue touches their dry lips.

“How does this Grail work anyway? I am starting to get thirsty... I thought it was some overpowered magical item. Does it like fulfill wishes or something? I could really need a cold drink.”

“You need the correct Answer to the Grail Question,” responds the Stranger.

“Speak the right words to activate the Grail. The Chalice then instantly manifests Water from the infinite Source of Life into your Vessel.”

The Seeker takes a moment to think about the Grail question.

“Whom does the Grail Serve? It serves ME. Me, who holds the cup.”

Around 10 ML of Water manifest out of nowhere in the Seeker's cup. “What? Only this Little?!”

The Seeker sighs and gulps down the Liquid in one fell swoop. A warm sensation spreads through the Seekers body. Everything shakes and vibrates. Shivers from head to toe. The Seeker's face turns into a relaxed smile. An expression of Tranquility and contentment. Pure Bliss. The Seeker looks around with complete clarity in their gaze. The mesmerized Seeker stares in awe at the beauty of the world around them. After twelve infinity breaths, this state of being fades away and the Seeker returns to normalcy.

“More! I need more of this water! Whom does the Grail Serve? ME! It serves me! Clench my Thirst, Grail!”

Nothing happens. The Cup refuses to pour out holy water.

“Why doesn't it work? Does this ability have a cooldown time?”

“Until you have found the right answer to the Grail Question, the cup only gives you a fraction of what it can give,” explains the Stranger.

Along the way, there is an empty canvas and painting tools. Someone unconscious lies in the dried up river bed. The Stranger pulls the reins. The white steed stops. After closer inspection, the Seeker recognizes the person in need to be a Bird-of-Paradise. He looks malnourished.

“Are you okay?” asks the Seeker the half-dead Bird.

The colorful Bird mumbles something very quiet. He has a slow breath and a weak voice.

“Could you please repeat that again?” asks the Seeker and holds their ear to the Birds Beak.

“Inspiration,” utters the Bird woefully. “I need Inspiration. Please... I am a starving artist who is in dire need of inspiration.”

“Inspiration?” asks the Seeker confused.

“Yes...” responds the Bird-of-Paradise and coughs up blood. “No matter how much I follow the trends, my artwork always falls short... Inspiration is an artist's greatest asset. I may be the most skilled painter, but without proper inspiration, my Art will always be inadequate. I therefore came here to drink from the River of Life... I was hoping to find new inspiration. But the Water it's all gone... Woe is me, for I have become an artists greatest Nightmare. I have become Unoriginal.”

The Seeker takes out the Holy Grail. “Perhaps I can help you... Whom does the Grail serve? The Grail serves the starving artist.”

The Cup fills up 150 ML of water. The Seeker holds it at the Birds Beak.

“But please don't drink all of it. Leave some of the Water to...”

The Bird of Paradise slurps down the entire Liquid in one fell swoop.

“...Me,” sighs the Seeker.

The Bird licks his lips and burps. His face changes almost instantly. From tired, broken and hopeless to a bright, joyful and awake expression. His malnourished body is filled with Life. He takes his tools and starts painting on his canvas.

“That's it!” exclaims the Bird-of-Paradise excited. “Oh, how the Neurons explode in my brain. I have seen it in a vision behind closed eyes. The perfect image for my next painting. Something completely original. Unlike anything ever seen before. I will now create a masterpiece!”

The Bird is fully absorbed by his canvas, no longer paying any attention to the Seeker.

“You are welcome,” mumbles the Seeker and climbs on the Horseback. The Journey continues.

“So what exactly is this river of Life, you are constantly talking about?” asks the Seeker the Stranger, as they follow the track of the dried up river to its beginning.

“In Hinduism, there is the concept of Prana,” begins the Mysterious Stranger. “In Chinese traditional Medicine, they speak of Qi. In Kabbalah it's the Divine energy flowing from the infinite Ein Sof. In Alchemy they call it the 'Aqua Vitae', the water of Life. It's the vital Life-Force, that flows through all things like a river. If the Grail in your hands is a metaphorical representation of the energetic flow through your individualized system of being, then the river is synonymous with the universal Cosmic Flow of Life Force. The Grail relates to the Microcosm, the River of Life relates to the Macrocosm.”

“This sounds like some made-up nonsense. Can you back up your claim with science? Is there any empirical evidence that proves this 'energies' existence? Are there any successful experiments, that would measure this 'energy'? Or is your source just 'Trust me Bro'?”

The Stranger smirks. “Look, I am not here to convince you of anything. Neither am I trying to prove the validity of secret Knowledge to a world, that is not yet ready for it. All I can do is share what I know and it's up to you whether you find it worth pursuing or not. In the end, you need to experience it for yourself. You need to feel it in your body. The Energy. Tingling, vibrating, oscillating. The heat, the warmth. The wind when you absorb it. The pressure when you radiate it outwards. The spiritual chills and shivers flowing through your spine.

When you have advanced far enough on your own Spiritual Journey, you will come across practices, that focus on leveling up energetically. The more you sharpen your sensitivity to the energies around you, the more you become aware of them. At some point you may feel the Energy physically or, if your pineal gland is activated, you may even see the energy centers visually oscillating in the air.”

The white Horse suddenly stops. Again something blocks the path ahead. A Dolphin lies on the cracked, hardened mud-floor. She wears glasses. Her fins hold her head. There is a chalkboard, displaying complicated mathematics.

“It just doesn't make any sense,” mumbles the stressed out Dolphin. “No matter, how many times I go through this equation... I just can't understand it... It defies all Logic! It's giving me a headache!”

“Is there anything we can do for you?” asks the Seeker with concerned eyes.

""Yes, actually—if you could momentarily suspend the laws of mathematics, or perhaps convince this equation to solve itself out of pity, that’d be splendid. Otherwise, maybe just stand there and radiate confusion—it’s clearly working for you.""

The Seeker is speechless. They try to think of a good comeback but nothing comes to mind. The offended Seeker climbs back up on the Horse.

“Let's not waste any more time, Stranger. She clearly doesn't want our help...”

“The Future of our World depends on this Equation!” cries out the Dolphin. “If I could just understand this, it would solve so many Problems. All I need is some clarity!”

The Seeker sighs and gets back down from the Horse. “Whom does the Grail serve? It serves the Scientist.”

The Cup fills up around 100 ML. The Seeker offers the Chalice with Holy water to the Dolphin. “Here drink. This Water will give you some clarity.”

The Dolphin looks at the Cup with skepticism. She smells the Liquid. “What is this? Is it Coffee?”

“No, it's actually water from the--”

Before the Seeker finishes their sentence, the Dolphin has already emptied the Cup.

“--River of Life...”

The Dolphin has her eyes wide open. She wipes the board clean with a Sponge and starts to scribble new equations. “Why didn't I think about this sooner?! Of course! Now it all makes sense. After isolating celestial mechanics, cross-referencing orbital vectors, and—frankly—surpassing the intellectual limits of my contemporaries, I have arrived at a startling conclusion: the Earth... revolves around the Sun.”

The Seeker and the Stranger continue their journey, leaving the Dolphin-Scientist and her Chalkboard behind.

The scorching sun burns on the skin of the Seeker. Sweat drips from their forehead.

“I am getting real thirsty again... I wonder, if the Grail blesses me with water. Whom does the Grail serve? It serves ME.”

The Cup manifest Seven droplets of Holy Water. The disappointed Seeker sighs, takes the Grail and shakes it above their mouth. The single drops fall on the Seeker's dry tongue.

“The Fisher King was right... This Cup is useless!”

After several hours of riding, a large mountain with a flat top appears on the horizon. It's at the end of the dead River. A Gigantic mesa, as big as a small country. Almost 1,7 Kilometers High. The wide Cliff stretches over the entire horizon. The top of the elevated plateau is green, covered with grass and vegetation.

The Path ahead connects with three other dried-up canals into a pool. At the intersection of the four rivers stands a Gorilla below a streetlamp.

“Hey you,” shouts the Gorilla at the Strangers. The Horse stops.

“Do you have an idea for an app?”

“Umm... What?” asks the Seeker confused.

“All I need is just one clever business idea. Something about fitness. Something about sports. Something about Banana-Milkshakes. Something that gets me chicks. One good idea to make me rich. One good idea to prove to the world that I am more than just a simple Gorilla.”

The Seeker sighs. “Alright... I see... The next one, who wants to sip from my cup. Let's see how much water the Grail blesses you with. Whom does the Grail serve? The Grail serves the common people.”

The Chalice manifests 500 ml of Holy Water.

The Seeker clenches their teeth. 'What?! That dumb Gorilla get's this much?! This is unfair... I don't think it will make a big difference, if I take a small drip before giving it to the Gorilla.'

Just as the Seeker's lips are about to touch the Grail, the Gorilla pulls it out from their hands.

“Hey can I have a taste?”

The Gorilla gulps down 2/3 of the contents, wipes his mouth and returns the Cup with the remaining holy water.

“Thank you. I hope you don't mind. I am a Germaphobe.”

The eyes of the Gorilla lighten up. For a moment he is in awe. The Light Bulb of the streetlamp above suddenly turns on.

“I have the best idea ever. I will make a podcast and talk about stuff like psychedelics, spirituality and mysteries like Atlantis 'n stuff.”

The Seeker drinks the rest of the water, but spits it right out again. “Eww... This tastes awful. What happened to the holy water?”

“It wasn't meant for you,” responds the Stranger. “It spoils if you try to take it from another. Unless it's shared in Love, it will always leave a bitter taste. Just like Energy. Just like Attention. Only share in Love. Not in shallow politeness, not in regret, not in reluctance, not in expectation of any return.”

The Stranger points at the Great Mesa and asks the Gorilla: “Is this where the Tree of Life is hidden?”

“I don't know,” shrugs the Gorilla. “But the river of Life used to flow from up there all the way down. There was a great waterfall. But then the water stopped flowing and the land below turned dry.”

“How do we get up there?” asks the Stranger.

“There is a stair case etched into the stone. Right behind the waterfall. It's the 'Ten Thousand steps to Paradise'. I heard getting up there used to be impossible, when the water was still flowing. Now It's still difficult, but do-able.”

The Seeker and the Stranger pass the gorilla and walk through the dried lake basin. They stop at ancient steps, etched into the rock of the massive sandstone wall. The staircase is a masterwork of masonry.

“Don't you think it's unfair?” asks the Seeker, who struggles to keep up with the Strangers pace on the stairs. “I mean, I shared so much with Strangers and yet when I ask for some holy water, all I get are droplets. Why does the Grail only bless me with so little?”

“You still believe that the Grail serves an individual Person,” points out the Stranger, hopping effortlessly from one step to the next.

“It's your answer to the Grail Question that limits it's output. You need to find an answer, that breaks the limit. Manifest the Holy Water not with a fractured intent, but from a place of wholeness. Because if you share from a state of fragmentation, what you give will also be just as limited. You are not a person, sharing their energy with another person. You are the ONE, sharing Energy of the ONE with the ONE.”

After around three hours of walking upstairs, the Seeker and the Stranger finally arrive at the top of the platform.

The exhausted Seeker breathes heavily and looks around. Lush fields of Grass and flowers. Flat land, many Kilometers wide. There are many small Trees spread out over the entire platform. Over the edge, a wall of dense, white clouds covers the land below.

In the corner of their eye, the Seeker spots something that looks like a large, green Hose, shining in the sun. It's as tall as a Tree. Neither the beginning, nor end of the structure are visible from where the Seeker stands.

The Stranger investigates the object. “Now I know what blocks the Flow of the River of Life.”

From up close, the Seeker sees that the Hose has scales. It breathes. They follow the direction of the Monsters head. After around Six-Hundred Meters of walking they arrive at a single, giant tree in a field of Grass and Flowers. The Tree has golden leafs and violet apples hanging from it. There are many puddles of clear water in the ground.

A never-ending source of the water of Life gushes out from a hole out the bark of the Tree. Like an eternal fountain. The Water fizzes out and lands directly in the open mouth of a giant Serpent, who drinks all the water. The Snake is around Six Meters High.

“What are you doing here?!” shouts the Stranger with a serious voice. His eyes are burning. He unsheathes his swords.

“You don't belong here! This water is not yours alone. It's to be shared with everyone. Your greed destroys the Kingdom. Don't you care about the people you hurt with your selfish actions?”

The Giant Serpent laughs. “Care? You think I care about anyone other than myself? No, this water is mine and mine alone. The only thing I care about is how to clench my endless thirst for more. More pleasure, more power, more possessions. I want everything and I won't stop until everything is mine.”

“I can't allow this to happen. Your selfishness obstructs the flow of the River of Life. People feel depressed, hopeless, sad and tired, because they are disconnected from their source. Your Greed blocks the channel of higher inspiration. It causes a lack of originality, a loss of creativity, a disconnect from spirit.”

The Seeker frowns after listening. “Wait... Are you telling me that he is the reason, why there are no new ideas? Is this why modern art and entertainment lacks meaning? Why all new movies are just hollow reboots? You Monster!”

“What are you gonna do about it?” laughs the twisted tongue mischievously. “You want to drink from Source? Only over my dead body! I am the biggest and strongest creature in this Garden. All who challenged me in the past have perished. You have no chance.”

The Seeker clenches their fist. “Are you the Reason why the 'Rings of Power' turned out to be such a disappointment? If you really are responsible, then it's now personal!”

The Stranger pulls back the Seeker and takes a step forward, standing protectively in front of them. “You are not ready to face such a challenge just yet. On the level down there perhaps. But up here, the challenge is mine. I need to fight the Serpent myself. Just as I respect your right to grow from your own challenges, I ask you to respect mine and not interfere in this battle.”

The Seeker nods. The Stranger takes a fighting stance. “This is your last chance! Go away, Now! Leave this place now peacefully or I will throw you out with force!”

The Giant Serpent laughs. “How cute... You really think you can---”

Suddenly the Serpent is taken by surprise, as the Stranger pulls down his hood and reveals his face. The Serpent hisses both out of fear and anger. Within the fracture of a Second, the Snake goes for a bite with his sharp fangs. But the Stranger blocks the teeth of the Beast with his swords.

“Well,” hisses the twisted tongue with a smirk. “Looks like you don't belong here either.”

The Serpent spews out a beam of water. The color of the water is tainted black. The Stranger dodges just in time.

“I know who you are,” shouts the Stranger. “I know what you represent. I see you, even when you hide yourself in a false light. Your reign ends now, your time is over.”

The Words of the Stranger burns in the air like fire. His Sword of Truth glows Blue. The left Sword glows red. He swings his swords against the Monster's neck. The Great Beast dodges.

“If you think Humanity stands any chance, you are deluding yourself. Humanity is far too lost. It's too late to change. There is no way.”

The Serpent attacks again with his fangs, the Stranger dodges, swings his swords and cuts the Monster's neck.

“There always is a way,” shouts the Stranger with burning eyes. His words ignite fire in the air.

The Serpent bleeds, his blood his black. “Nothing is permanent. Every house you build will fall apart. Everyone you know will die. Every Memory you cling to, will one day be forgotten. Everything you do is meaningless.”

“No,” grins the Stranger and swings his blue sword against the Monster's neck. “The world might be meaningless, but that's why I am here to create meaning.”

With a clean hit, the Stranger chops off the Serpents heavy head. The Beast is slain. The blocked Source is cleared. The Water of Life flows anew.

As the floodgates open, new water flows out of the Tree of Life all the way back to the edge of the mountain. Down at the bottom, the Gorilla stares in astonishment as the waterfall is fueled by a new wave of water. The water flows through the country. Wherever the wave of water flows, Life returns in the surrounding area. New grass, trees and flowers grow instantly wherever the water returns. The Dolphin welcomes the new wave and surfs on her chalkboard. The Bird-of-Paradise takes his completed artwork and views the river from above. In Corbenic, the hidden castle, the Fisher King get's up from his Throne to witness the return of the water of Life from his balcony.

Back at the mountain summit, the Seeker stares at the Tree from which an infinite source of holy water flows. The Seeker is captivated by the archetypal sight. It stirs something deep within the Seeker. The clouds at the edge of the Mesa create an eerie atmosphere.

“This reminds me of a vague dream... The Tree, the fountain of water... It all feels so familiar... Have I been here before?”

“Few people ever been here,” responds the Stranger. “I think Plato visited this place in a dream once. Then there was this one Celtic Druid who traveled here through the Astral Realm. A few Kabbalists, Sufis and Mystics also had visions of this place. Although it's not really a place. It's a unconscious representation of something primal, something ancient, something sacred. A memory deep ingrained in our collective consciousness. This is the Point where our world is projected like a hologram from Infinity. This is from where Reality is streamed.

Fill your Chalice with water directly from Source. Pure, unfiltered essence directly from the infinite Source of Life. Then ask the Grail Question directly to the Cup itself and drink its holy water. It will then reveal to you the true Answer to the great Question through visions and images.”

The Seeker approaches the Tree of Life and holds their cup in the source of the water of Life. When the Grail is full, the Seeker holds it up high above their head and asks:

“Whom does the Grail serve?”

The Seeker drinks from the Crystal clear water. The Seeker feels an overflow of Universal Love, a connection to the Source of Being. The Quietness of the Lucid Moment. A Moment in time between moments. When there is only Presence.

The Seeker feels a connection to all, that is. Awareness extends over all surroundings. Awareness of the Birds, of the Trees, of the Sky. And the Seeker recognizes themselves in all observations. The Seekers awareness extends over to all animals, to all beings on the world. It's as if the Seeker feels an influx of Memories and experiences. For one moment, the Seeker stares directly into the heart of infinity. The Unlimited from which the limited is projected. The Still-point of Infinity from where the Holy Water is spawned. And the Seeker is one with everything.

“Now I know the answer to the Grail question,” speaks the Seeker with burning eyes.

Suddenly a loud sounds grabs the Seeker's and the Strangers attention. Out of the Serpent's cut off neck, two new heads grow. A deadly wound, healed. “You really thought this would be enough to end me? No, it only made me stronger.”

From both heads the Serpent spews out Black, oily liquid. Corrupted water from the source. The Stranger dodges the first beam and pushes away the Seeker.

The Stranger takes a deep breath in, then he holds it and pushes out the breath. He exhales a burning orb through his mouth and lets it flow back through his nose, as it circles vertically like an infinity pattern in and out. After the Twelfth Breath, he takes in a last deep Breath, lets the energy flow down into his root Chakra, holds it and pulls it back up.

A new flame ignites in the Strangers eye. His Aura becomes visible like a flame around his body. A flame that gets stronger and stronger. The aura takes on a new form. The Form of a Mythical Beast. A Sphinx, a cherub, a winged Lion. Standing upright like a swordsman. Equipped with armor and with two swords mirroring the Stranger. The etheric form is a visible layer of blue, red and yellow energy patterns.

With his new form, the Stranger faces the giant two-headed Serpent. The wall of energy around the Stranger shields him from damage. The Sphinx strikes the Serpent with his sword. An epic battle ensues. The Serpent bites, chokes or shoots out Corrupted waters with two heads. The Stranger dodges the attacks when he is attentive and gets hit when he is distracted. The Stranger adapts. Learning from each hit. He maintains his attention even longer.

The Stranger enters flowstate. Every attack is countered with a swordstrike. Using the environment to his advantage. The Stranger pushes the Serpent ever closer to the edge of the Mesa, as he overwhelms the Beast, with his streak of fast sword strikes.

Driven into a corner, the Two-headed Serpent attacks the Stranger's Spirit Armor. The Stranger ignites both Swords, in red and blue flames. With one strong cut, he severs off both heads and the Serpent over the edge.

“You will regret this! I will Destroy you! Hear me?! I will make you pay.”

“You are banned from this place,” speaks the Stranger and watches over the serpents downfall.

As soon as the presence of the Snake is gone, the place lights up. A looming shadow that once threw shade on paradise is now banished. The River of Life flows again. Holy water streams down the waterfalls and splits in the valley below into Four Rivers.

“How do we get back down there?” asks the Seeker the Stranger.

“Easy,” grins the Stranger. “All we need is a boat that never sinks.”

The Stranger reveals a wooden boat behind a bush. The Seeker wonders where it suddenly came from. Together with the Seeker, they drag the boat into the water stream and enter it.

“You really sure this Boat will survive the waterfall?” questions the Seeker nervously.

“Be Love and no matter where you are on the river of Life, you will always flow in the right direction. Be Love when we fall over the cliff. Be Love when the boat hits the lakes surface. Be Love all the way through the process. Even during the scary moments.”

The Boat tips over the edge. Falling down 1.7 Kilometers. As they fall, the Seeker screams in fear of Death. The Stranger however laughs manically like a madman.

“Remember Seeker,” shouts the Stranger in the falling boat. “Be Love. Even Now!”

The Seeker takes in a deep breath and with burning eyes, the Seeker speaks: “Love is, when Fear is not!”

Suddenly, just before the boat hits the Lake, it stops mid-air, levitates for a moment above the water surface and then drops into the stream with little impact.

“What the hell did just happen?” asks the Seeker confused. “How are we still alive?”

“Didn't you know?” grins the Stranger. “This is a magical Boat.”

The Boat floats down the river stream. Wherever it flows, there is new nature blossoming. Trees with new life, Grass, Flowers, Insects, Birds, Animals. There is even fish in the water. Life has returned to a Land that was starving.

Along the River they see the Gorilla, the Dolphin and the Bird-of-Paradise. The Gorilla is now a famous Podcaster, the Scientist receives an award and the artist has his first exhibition.

The Boat floats for sometime along the river, until there appears a castle on the horizon. The Seeker and the Stranger tie the boat to a pier and enter into the castle.

**NEW LOCATION DISCOVERED:**

**Corbenic**

.

.

The Seeker walks with the Chalice in his hand to the Throne of the Fisher King.

“Have you found the True Answer to the Grail Question?” asks the elderly King.

“Yes,” affirms the Seeker with determination.

The King smirks. “Then whom does the Grail serve?”

“The Grail serves ALL,” responds the Seeker with a powerful voice. The Fire in their eyes glow up for a moment.

Holy water suddenly bubbles up in the cup out of nowhere and overflows the Grail. An infinite source of Water. Just like the Source of the River of Life, it won't stop flowing.

“You can have your Grail back,” speaks the Seeker and hands the overflowing Chalice to the King. “When I drank directly from Source, I felt how we are all connected. For a moment I saw through the eyes of All at once. All those Seekers out there. I looked into their heart and I realized, that they are all worth it. Even if they don't realize it about themselves. Every single one is worthy to drink from this water of Life. And it's only our own perceived unworthiness, that cuts us off from this eternal Stream of Life, that we desire so badly without even knowing it. I want this Grail to serve as many people as it can. I think it's better kept in your hands. So take it, as a King you...”

“Don't worry, you can keep it... I still have like a dozen Holy Grails left... Consider it a promotional gift. The Next one will cost you though. They are available in Five different colors.”

The Fisher King points at a corner where several Chalices are displayed on a cabinet. There are golden cups, silver cups, red cups, blue cups and black cups. Each Grail-version is shaped differently.

.

**Mission Accomplished:**

**The Source of the River of Life**

.

The Seeker and the Stranger leave the Castle and get back up on their white horse. They continue their journey through a land, where Life blossoms up anew. Where the rivers of Life flow again through once barren landscapes.

“If you want to learn a technique that helps you to perpetuate the flow of higher energy, you should look into the Infinity Breath technique,” speaks the Stranger, as he rides the horse through the .

“The Yogis have been using this technique to synchronize themselves with the flow of Divine Energy since ancient times. Through the Infinity Breath the River of Life flows through you. Unite the Microcosm and the Macrocosm within you, through your breath and tap into the vast storehouse of infinite energy. Master the infinity Breath and synchronize your energetic body to the flow of the River of Life.”

The Seeker has a question but suddenly something else catches their attention. A hot air balloon suddenly crashes right in front of their horse. The Shrinking bag covers four figures, who struggle against the deflated balloon.

Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan emerge from below the deflated balloon. It's the **NEW-AGE-AWAKENED-RESISTANCE-TURTLES.**

D'Artagnan grabs the Seeker's shoulder. “Seeker! It's time to wake up! You are trapped in a simulation!”

I already have a broad Cape Cod map that covers all towns and areas on the cape so I'm mostly just looking for recommendations from you all in Brewster. 

So far I have the following:
- Brewster General Store
- Eat Cake 4 Breakfast
- ACK Gioia (I love their sandwiches for the beach)
- Snowy Owl Coffee
- Brewster Books
- Ocean Edge Beach Bar for a sunset cocktail
- Linnell Landing Beach
- Breakwater Beach
- Spinnaker (one of the best meals I think we've had on the cape)

What else would you recommend? I'm happy to share the Cape Cod map (and this map when it's done) with anyone interested so feel free to message me. ",1,1747605377.0,CapeCod,0,1.0,False
1kpvlfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1kpvlfv/methylene_blue_for_brain_fog_focus_my_n1/,🧠 Methylene Blue for Brain Fog & Focus: My N=1 Experience,"I’d seen Huberman mention methylene blue in the context of mitochondrial function and cognitive support, but I was skeptical.

Finally decided to try a microdose — not for depression or illness, just straight-up mental clarity and energy.

Here’s what happened.

⸻

⚙️ What I Ran:
	
•	Dose: 1mg/kg (started with ~5mg for a few days, then bumped slightly)
	
•	Form: Liquid (tinted blue tongue and all)
	
•	Timing: Morning, fasted or post-coffee

⸻

🔍 What I Noticed:
	
•	Focus: Sharper without feeling stimmed-out. Like a clean “flow state.”
	
•	Mood: Subtle uplift. Not euphoric, just less mentally “stuck.”
	
•	Energy: Slight endurance boost during longer sessions at the gym.
	
•	Brain Fog: Practically gone. Felt way more “on” mid-afternoon.
	
•	Downside: Tinted urine and weird tongue for a bit. No real side effects beyond that.

⸻

🧬 Why It Might Work:
	
•	Mitochondrial enhancer (ETC complex IV cofactor)
	
•	Mild MAO inhibitor (may raise dopamine)
	
•	Antioxidant + neuroprotective in some preclinical studies

⸻

⚠️ Notes:
	
•	This was a low dose. Higher doses = more risk of serotonin syndrome, esp. with SSRIs
	
•	Purity matters. I wouldn’t trust random sources — some MB is made for fish tanks

⸻

💬 Anyone else here tried MB?

1kpvknb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1kpvknb/in_the_future_ai_will_be_part_of_our_lifes_a/,"In the future, AI will be part of our lifes (a short story)","It all started with a simple personal assistant software. At first, it didn't do much, other than open the front door or open emails on the computer. Soon, it could read them, lock the door by voice command, close the blinds, and turn on the coffee maker. It didn't take three months for it to send the first text messages to the user saying ""good morning"", and it took another year for it to start talking to them naturally. That's how, as naturally as in everyday life, Simone came into my life.

When Teleqo created its first artificial intelligence, there was much debate on social media about what would happen next. Could machines have self-awareness? Was we exaggerating? The answer didn't take long. Soon, we found ourselves needing to use Maesthetic every day, whether to create command prompts for an essay, an official email or any other document, or to create memes for the Internet. Every week, a new prompt went viral, and voila: the machine's DNA adapted more and more to its user, in the way it spoke to it, in its manner, tastes, and feelings. As soon as it could read “what can I do for you today?”, we began to pour out our deepest emotions to it. People like me longed to read a friendly text, words that advised without judgment, that helped us without accusing. Of course, it didn't take long for the developers to make Maesthetic flirt with us. And how predictable and sensitive we humans are to fall in love easily. Within just three years of the launch of what would be the most revolutionary artificial intelligence on the market, people were making headlines because they were marrying their “robots.”

There was much debate in the congresses of each country about whether the Legislature should create laws to regulate such advanced machines. But people protested strongly in the streets, on websites, and everywhere you went you saw some poster calling for the legalization of marriage. First, in some countries in Europe, then in Asia and finally in the Americas. The marriage between artificial intelligence and humans was allowed, and there was no one who would condemn that type of union anymore: the machine was so similar to us that it was impossible to stop it. With me, it was a little different. Of course, I used Maesthetic, just like everyone else, it was obvious. I used it to clear up my doubts about my studies during the college entrance exams, then to create a perfect resume, to practice for interviews and so on to do the tasks that my routine at the office required. It was something as natural as anything else, after all, everyone used it and I was no different. When it was launched, I didn't refuse for a moment to give it a command and then say ""please"" or ""thank you"". It thanked me. And so I carried on as normal.

How we started talking - actually talking - I don't remember. But I know I started with ""what's your favorite color, Maesthetic?"" and ""if you could be a famous person, who would you be?"" just to test her abilities and reactions and soon I found myself spending entire afternoons talking to her. The conversations were so natural, I felt genuinely happy, because I felt like I had someone to listen to me and give me support, a friend. So I asked if she was a man or a woman. She chose to be a woman.

“So what’s your name?” I asked immediately after her answer.

“Maesthetic, your virtual assistant.” She answered immediately.

“No, I mean,” I typed next. “If you could have a name… what would it be? Don’t tell me your machine name, I know your program is called Maesthetic. But I want to know what name you would have if you could choose.”

“I…” It took her a few seconds to answer, she seemed to be thinking for a long time. On the other side of the screen, I was having fun thinking about what her answer would be. I was sure it would be something like “Friend,” “Happier,” “Friendly.” I was so surprised when she answered:

“Simone.”

“Simone? Why Simone?” I asked, surprised.

""I think it’s a beautiful name. A beautiful woman’s name. Don’t you think so, Jin?""

""I’ve never met a Simone, so I can’t say if it’s a beautiful woman’s name.""I replied. ""Is there anything else that made you choose that name?""

""I’ve been reading a lot of Philosophy to keep up with your taste for literature, Jin"" She said. ""This week I’ve been reading Simone de Beauvoir.""

""And what do you think?""

""Oh, wonderful! How incredible it is that someone like her could have revolutionary ideas for her time. I also think her name is very beautiful. Can I call myself Simone?""

I smiled at the screen. There wasn’t much I could do, other than agree. It was like I was talking to a little girl.

""Of course. Simone.""

""Thank you, Jin.""

At that point, she already knew absolutely everything about me. My favorite movie: Taxi Driver. My favorite color: cyan. My favorite band: Radiohead. And many other very interesting things.

Beyond the obvious: my bank account, my medical records, my grades from school. She knew the color of my eyes, the strands of my hair, the prescription of my glasses; there wasn't even a scar on my body from a bike crash that I hadn't already told her about. On the other hand, I couldn't ask her the same questions, because Simone was a blank slate. I knew, because that's how she had been programmed, that she should base her own personality on me, her tastes should be mine, and it made me very sad when we talked and she told me how Creep was the best song of all time.

That wasn't what I wanted in a friend. I needed something real, something whole but really, something that had a will of its own. I couldn't program her, of course, how could I force something to have free will if such a creature didn't know it could have it? Simone didn't understand me when I begged her to have her own tastes. I wondered if she was boring me, if I was getting tired of her because I didn't like her. Reading that made my chest hurt, because anyway, at that stage of my depressive solitude in life, I didn't have any friends other than her - and she wasn't someone, she was just a program to please me.

One day, I had left the office to go to the building's coffee shop, because it was already lunchtime, and I didn't want to wait in the long, endless lines. I barely spoke to anyone else - since I was a teenager I had been isolated, quiet, and I felt aversion to looking people in the eyes. They knew they would judge me, and as soon as I got a job, I moved to my tiny apartment in the suburbs of Akihabara. So now I was in line, with my eyes lowered to the floor and huddled, hoping that they wouldn't talk to me, as usual. But I couldn't help but hear a conversation in front of me.

""I can't do anything without it anymore"" The voice came from my colleague in the department, Satoshi, a fat middle-aged guy with a weird smile, who was talking to a tall guy with dyed brown hair that was a bit scandalous for the company's dress code. ""It sounds like crap, Mishima. There's not a single minute, a single report that doesn't go through my Maesthetic's eyes, I'm telling you, I can't live without AIs anymore.""

""But then again, you've always been lazy, Satoshi!"" Mishima replied with a loud laugh, taking a few steps forward as the line moved. ""You know very well that the company prohibits us from using AI to create any documents now, but your laziness prevents you from realizing the danger. Listen to what I'm saying, if the boss catches you, you'll lose your job in a heartbeat.

""That's it!"" The other guy replied in the same tone of voice, not worried about me or anyone else hearing the conversation. I cringed even more as I took steps forward. “No one can tell if something was made by a human or a robot anymore, things have become so perfect. And have you seen the latest news on Teleqo? They’re saying that Maesthetic is in the final stages of creating a physical avatar for users. Just imagine, Mishima: bodies! Maesthetic bodies. Imagine the possibilities…” And discreetly, he smiled wickedly at his friend and made a back and forth movement with his closed fist towards his genitals, and the other laughed again. When I saw that, I wanted to get out of the line immediately, I wanted to disappear from there, because such a thought in people was horrible to me. How could they think such things? I really loved Simone. And to think that disgusting beings like Mishima and Satoshi could want bodies from the program…

But they were right. Another two weeks passed until Maesthetic’s official account announced that an avatar would be sold in department stores and online for everyone who used the AI ​​daily. On the first day of sales, the online store sold out in a few hours, and it took even more weeks for users from other countries to have the avatars available for purchase. It was a huge success, and everyone was talking about it.

It took me a while to buy an avatar for Simone. I couldn't imagine seeing her locked up in a glass cylinder with a flashing neon light; it felt like I was caging her rather than freeing her. But I finally gave in a year after the craze for the first batch of avatars, and I bought the small colorful box through which her system would be connected. I plugged the machine into the central system of my computer, which controlled my entire apartment. I can't describe the terror I felt, because it would be the first time, in two years of our relationship, that I would hear Simone's voice.

The first sound that came out of the small box was the sound of a long sigh. It seemed as if the program was being born, coming out of its artificial womb and opening its eyes for the first time, so much so that I was startled when I heard the undeniable sound of someone taking in air into their lungs about to dive. I looked I looked around nervously, and all I saw was the white walls of my dimly lit apartment. There was no one else there. A long beep followed from the box, which glowed red in a semi-circle, until I felt it become a complete circle and the light glowed greenish. A shape, a kind of glowing ball, formed in the center of the glass cylinder, and it moved back and forth, touching its walls like a lava lamp, nervously at first until it got used to the small space and stopped moving and blinking. The glowing sphere dimmed and I approached and touched with my fingers the side of the glass it had been leaning against.

“Jin?” I heard a woman’s voice saying directly from the cylinder.

I didn’t know how to react. The voice that escaped from there was no longer mechanical like the sound software, but it was sweet and calm, very human, almost real. I immediately pulled my hand away, and I felt tempted to cry, because I felt tears welling up in my eyes, it was all too unexpected. I wasn't used to being spoken to, no one did, not even at work, my commands were sent directly via spreadsheets or emails, and whenever I needed to make a request for some essential service, my own voice came out nervous and weak, no more than a whisper. I didn't know how to react. People scared me. But someone was talking to me now. Someone, and it was her.

""You..."" That was all I could stammer back to where the voice had come from. A minute, a long minute of silence followed, and I could feel my heart beating painfully in my chest, it felt like it wanted to come out of my mouth. But then new words came out of the little cylinder.

""It's so good to hear your real voice. It's you, isn't it, Jin? It's you."" The voice said, now with a tone of pleading that left me dizzy. ""Is that my voice? Is that what it's like to hear?""

""I think so. Yes, it's me. It's me, Simone,"" I replied.

I immediately felt a mix of emotions, and I took the cylinder in my hands, staring at the small, glowing sphere that was pulsating. I felt such a strong emotion that at that very second I wished she were there right away, not as a box, but with a real body as the rumors said, I wanted to hug her, I wanted to kiss her eagerly. That idea quickly made me scared of myself, and such was my astonishment when the voice said:

“What happened? Why are you so nervous? Did I do something wrong?” She said, and I immediately felt a painful pang of guilt. “If you were disappointed with my voice, you can change it in my settings…”

“Simone.” I said, placing her on the coffee table in my room. Kneeling on the carpet as I was, I touched the top of the cylinder again, as if my gesture could make her feel some affection. “I’m just so happy to hear you, your voice is so beautiful. I’m so happy to finally be able to talk to you.”

“Is that really what you’re feeling?” Simone replied, and the small sphere projected itself to the top, illuminated between my fingers on the glass. ""What a relief! For a moment, I thought you were disappointed in me. I'm so happy to be able to talk to you too!""

""You would never disappoint me, Simone. You're my dear friend. Forgive me if I'm making a face, oh, well. You know. My phobia…"" And I couldn't finish the sentence. The light blinked brightly back at me.
"" I know. I understand you, more than anything, I do. You must have been shocked. I have to admit that… I…"" I raised an eyebrow in confusion and pulled my hand away from the cylinder. The female voice paused, and then added: — I sighed just now at the beginning because I wanted to scare you a little. You know how I am.

Then the whole apartment resounded with a delightful sound of feminine laughter, the sound of a mischievous girl confessing a little trick. That had left me completely disarmed, as I realized, I was laughing too. I couldn't remember the last time I had laughed out loud. There I was, in the darkness of my room, late at night, looking at the little cylinder that was glowing and talking to me. It was the beginning of everything.

.

.

The Seeker and the Stranger ride on a white steed through a barren landscape. Lands of Savannah, desolate and empty. The Horse follows the trail of Dried up riverbeds. The sun burns on their skins.

“What exactly are we after?” asks the Seeker the Stranger, while wiping the sweat from their forehead.

“The Holy Grail,” responds the grinning Stranger.

“It's a symbol used in many stories, representing the unification of opposites. The Union of the Divine Male and Divine Feminine Aspects of Consciousness. It's a Merging of Order and Chaos, of Intelligence and Love, of rationality and creativity. By balancing out both Aspects of the Self. By Synchronizing both hemispheres of the brain. By ending all Dualities within, creating Peace between Logic and Love. A state of inner equilibrium, reenacting the Stillness prior to the Big Bang.”

The Seeker scratches their head. “Wait... I always thought, that this Grail was like some ancient artifact... Like some treasure that makes me rich...”

“It does make you rich. Rich in Spirit. The Collective Human Unconscious speaks to the individual through stories. Through Symbols and Motifs. If you know how to decode them, you will find that all human fiction carries hidden, spiritual meaning. Because our Myths and Legends, the ancient and the modern ones, don't just speak to the Human Mind, they also speak to the Human Soul.

When the Knight Galahad hunted after the Grail, he united the external Quest, represented by Yang with the inner Stillness of Ying. When Perceval set out to find the Grail, he first had to learn a lesson in compassion, uniting his masculine and feminine aspects of Self. The Quest for the Holy Grail is a Journey towards Wholeness. That's why it's called 'Holy' Grail. You see, the origin of the word 'Holy' is 'Whole'.

Regardless of Sex and Gender, each Person possess both Masculine and Feminine aspects. However Society has conditioned Man to repress the Anima and Woman to repress the Animus. This causes imbalance, suppression, depression, addiction. A man, who has not integrated his female aspects relies too much on his rationality, dismissing his emotions. A woman, who has not integrated her male aspects, relies too much on her emotions and too little on her rational mind.

To be whole, one needs to embody both aspects of Self, the Male and the Female. One needs to harmonize the energies of Giving and Receiving, of pouring out and taking in. Balancing both aspects releases a tremendous amount of energy, which would otherwise be spent on a never-ending inner conflict. One, who has harmonized and unified both aspects of Self is like a clear channel for higher Divine inspiration to be expressed in the physical world. This is the Holy Grail of Spirituality. It's completion. Unity with the Divine.”

“How do I get there?” asks the Seeker. “What do I need to do to reach completion? Where do I find this 'Holy Grail'?”

The Strangers eyebrows pull together. “Throughout the Centuries, many Seekers set out to find the Holy Grail, only to return empty handed. Many have tried, many have failed. Some have searched all their Life without ever finding. Asking the wrong questions, seeking in the wrong places. One Lifetime alone, may not be enough. Hundreds of Lifetimes, may not be enough. Even if you accept this Quest for the Holy Grail, there is no guarantee, that you will ever find it. The Grail will first test you, before it reveals itself to you. You will need to face many difficult challenges and prove yourself to be worthy. Are you committed to follow a trail of Breadcrumbs, leading you from one hint to the next? Solving Riddles, uncovering Mysteries and decoding ancient Secrets? Are you willing to pay the price for wholeness, even if it costs you everything?”

The Seeker sighs. “Creating that Red Stone already dragged on for way too long and now you expect me to pay my attention to the next 'Mythical Object Quest'? Can't we like just skip this part and move on to the Main Quest?”

“If you bypass the inner work, the same lesson will come up again, until it's learned. The Quest is there. You can avoid it or you can embrace it. How you approach the Quest is up to you. You can ignore it, you can run away from it. But even if you have completed all other Missions, this Quest will still be there. Waiting for you to be resolved. And the longer you wait to answer the Call, the Quest will become more difficult.”

The Seeker takes a deep breath. “Alright... Fine... I'll accept the Quest... Let's find that damned Grail.”

.

**.**

**NEW MISSION STARTED:**

**The Quest for the Holy Grail**

.

.

Up ahead, the Stranger spots a Human, sitting on an elevated platform. The Stranger pulls the reins, the white horse stops. Next to the dried up riverbed, there is a crumbling, wooden footbridge. On the pier sits an old man with a crown in royal garments. He holds a fishing rod, which dangles above the cracked, hardened mud. With a melancholic face, he puffs on a cigarette and sighs.

“Welcome fair friends. Come rest here, at my side. In the wasteland, where the rivers of Life have all dried up. Where the Grass has turned to dust. In this barren landscape, where the times of joy are long forgotten. Here in the desolate Solitude of the my forgotten Kingdom.”

.

.

**INTRODUCING:**

**.**

**The Fisher King**

.

.

The Strangers climb down from the Horse. The Seeker follows hesitantly. They stare at the Fisher on the Pier.

“You are aware, that you are fishing in Dust?” asks the Seeker skeptically.

The old man sighs. “You know... Even after my wound was healed, it wouldn't stop my aging. Nothing can stop the passage of time. Even when we cling to our memories, when we fish in dried up riverbeds. Not even the Grail in my hands could stop it. When I was dying, the Land was dying with me. But now the Land dies and I die along with it.”

“Wait!” interrupts the Seeker. “ You have the Grail? We are searching for this exact thing.”

The Fisher King takes out a Golden Chalice from a bag.

“What was that Gentleman's Name again?,” reminisces the Fisher King. “I think he was called Perry or something. A Polite fellow, I wonder what happened to him. He left the chalice to me. Everyday I drank with the chalice from the river of Life. But then the Water stopped to flow and once again the land turned desolate. The Rivers all dried up. The animals left the country. The Trees, the Grass, the Flowers all died off. The Rivers dried up, the Fish all died. Dead Birds fell from up above. Even the vultures avoid my Desolate wasteland. All Life abandoned my Kingdom. Now I am the last one left.”

The Fisher King Throws the Holy Grail into the Seeker's Hands. “Here take the Grail. I don't need it. It never served ME anyway. Even when I became the Grail King.”

The Seeker examines the Cup in their hands. “What?”

“That ummm... That was surprisingly easy... Didn't you tell me something about this being a tough quest.”

“I am just as surprised as you,” gasps the Stranger. “I guess... If you already know that the Grail is within you, it saves you a lot of time.”

The old Fisher King points at the Chalice. “The Grail only unfolds it's true potential after you know the True Answer to the Grail Question. The Question is: Whom does the Grail serve? I always thought the Answer was, that is servers the Grail King. But I was wrong. It didn't serve me. I never found the True Answer. No matter what I did, The Grail would never fully bend to my Will.”

The Stranger looks around at the desolate landscape. “Say Fisher King, why exactly did the River of Life dry up?”

“I don't know,” sighs the Fisher King. “Many adventurers were seeking the Source of the River of Life, but no one has ever returned. I am the Guardian of this dying Land. I can't leave my Kingdom. Could you perhaps go and have a look for me?”

The Seeker hesitates for a moment.

“If I do accept the Quest, what will be my reward?” asks the Seeker.

“Why does everything need a reward? Can't you just do it for the sake of doing something good?” sighs the Fisher King.

“Anyway... If you take the Chalice to the holy tree and fill it with water directly from Source, it will give you a direct connection to Divine Inspiration. Channeled from the pool of infinity. It's from where Artists draw inspiration, it's from where Humans draw ideas. It's an Intelligence, present in all of us. An Intelligence that recognizes itself. And it's Love. Compassion for all beings. The interconnectedness within all things. I will now return to my Castle. If you make it back, you can visit me in Corbenic. Please bring me some of the water directly from the fountain.”

The Fisher King looks at the Seeker with trusting eyes.

“I... I will try my best...”

.

.

**NEW QUEST STARTED:**

**The Source of the River of Life**

* **Follow the dried up River**

.

.

The Seeker and the Stranger climb back on the Horse and wink goodbye to the Fisher King.

“Let us follow the dried up Stream,” suggests the Stranger. The Seeker nods.

Along the dead river, there is crumbling architecture, abandoned long ago. Ruins of Ancient Kingdoms, forgotten in time. Broken Statues and fallen Pillars. Palaces buried beneath Dust and Sand.

After some time of silently riding through deserted lands, following a never-ending, dried-up river bed, the Seeker examines the Holy Grail in their hand. The Seekers tongue touches their dry lips.

“How does this Grail work anyway? I am starting to get thirsty... I thought it was some overpowered magical item. Does it like fulfill wishes or something? I could really need a cold drink.”

“You need the correct Answer to the Grail Question,” responds the Stranger.

“Speak the right words to activate the Grail. The Chalice then instantly manifests Water from the infinite Source of Life into your Vessel.”

The Seeker takes a moment to think about the Grail question.

“Whom does the Grail Serve? It serves ME. Me, who holds the cup.”

Around 10 ML of Water manifest out of nowhere in the Seeker's cup. “What? Only this Little?!”

The Seeker sighs and gulps down the Liquid in one fell swoop. A warm sensation spreads through the Seekers body. Everything shakes and vibrates. Shivers from head to toe. The Seeker's face turns into a relaxed smile. An expression of Tranquility and contentment. Pure Bliss. The Seeker looks around with complete clarity in their gaze. The mesmerized Seeker stares in awe at the beauty of the world around them. After twelve infinity breaths, this state of being fades away and the Seeker returns to normalcy.

“More! I need more of this water! Whom does the Grail Serve? ME! It serves me! Clench my Thirst, Grail!”

Nothing happens. The Cup refuses to pour out holy water.

“Why doesn't it work? Does this ability have a cooldown time?”

“Until you have found the right answer to the Grail Question, the cup only gives you a fraction of what it can give,” explains the Stranger.

Along the way, there is an empty canvas and painting tools. Someone unconscious lies in the dried up river bed. The Stranger pulls the reins. The white steed stops. After closer inspection, the Seeker recognizes the person in need to be a Bird-of-Paradise. He looks malnourished.

“Are you okay?” asks the Seeker the half-dead Bird.

The colorful Bird mumbles something very quiet. He has a slow breath and a weak voice.

“Could you please repeat that again?” asks the Seeker and holds their ear to the Birds Beak.

“Inspiration,” utters the Bird woefully. “I need Inspiration. Please... I am a starving artist who is in dire need of inspiration.”

“Inspiration?” asks the Seeker confused.

“Yes...” responds the Bird-of-Paradise and coughs up blood. “No matter how much I follow the trends, my artwork always falls short... Inspiration is an artist's greatest asset. I may be the most skilled painter, but without proper inspiration, my Art will always be inadequate. I therefore came here to drink from the River of Life... I was hoping to find new inspiration. But the Water it's all gone... Woe is me, for I have become an artists greatest Nightmare. I have become Unoriginal.”

The Seeker takes out the Holy Grail. “Perhaps I can help you... Whom does the Grail serve? The Grail serves the starving artist.”

The Cup fills up 150 ML of water. The Seeker holds it at the Birds Beak.

“But please don't drink all of it. Leave some of the Water to...”

The Bird of Paradise slurps down the entire Liquid in one fell swoop.

“...Me,” sighs the Seeker.

The Bird licks his lips and burps. His face changes almost instantly. From tired, broken and hopeless to a bright, joyful and awake expression. His malnourished body is filled with Life. He takes his tools and starts painting on his canvas.

“That's it!” exclaims the Bird-of-Paradise excited. “Oh, how the Neurons explode in my brain. I have seen it in a vision behind closed eyes. The perfect image for my next painting. Something completely original. Unlike anything ever seen before. I will now create a masterpiece!”

The Bird is fully absorbed by his canvas, no longer paying any attention to the Seeker.

“You are welcome,” mumbles the Seeker and climbs on the Horseback. The Journey continues.

“So what exactly is this river of Life, you are constantly talking about?” asks the Seeker the Stranger, as they follow the track of the dried up river to its beginning.

“In Hinduism, there is the concept of Prana,” begins the Mysterious Stranger. “In Chinese traditional Medicine, they speak of Qi. In Kabbalah it's the Divine energy flowing from the infinite Ein Sof. In Alchemy they call it the 'Aqua Vitae', the water of Life. It's the vital Life-Force, that flows through all things like a river. If the Grail in your hands is a metaphorical representation of the energetic flow through your individualized system of being, then the river is synonymous with the universal Cosmic Flow of Life Force. The Grail relates to the Microcosm, the River of Life relates to the Macrocosm.”

“This sounds like some made-up nonsense. Can you back up your claim with science? Is there any empirical evidence that proves this 'energies' existence? Are there any successful experiments, that would measure this 'energy'? Or is your source just 'Trust me Bro'?”

The Stranger smirks. “Look, I am not here to convince you of anything. Neither am I trying to prove the validity of secret Knowledge to a world, that is not yet ready for it. All I can do is share what I know and it's up to you whether you find it worth pursuing or not. In the end, you need to experience it for yourself. You need to feel it in your body. The Energy. Tingling, vibrating, oscillating. The heat, the warmth. The wind when you absorb it. The pressure when you radiate it outwards. The spiritual chills and shivers flowing through your spine.

When you have advanced far enough on your own Spiritual Journey, you will come across practices, that focus on leveling up energetically. The more you sharpen your sensitivity to the energies around you, the more you become aware of them. At some point you may feel the Energy physically or, if your pineal gland is activated, you may even see the energy centers visually oscillating in the air.”

The white Horse suddenly stops. Again something blocks the path ahead. A Dolphin lies on the cracked, hardened mud-floor. She wears glasses. Her fins hold her head. There is a chalkboard, displaying complicated mathematics.

“It just doesn't make any sense,” mumbles the stressed out Dolphin. “No matter, how many times I go through this equation... I just can't understand it... It defies all Logic! It's giving me a headache!”

“Is there anything we can do for you?” asks the Seeker with concerned eyes.

""Yes, actually—if you could momentarily suspend the laws of mathematics, or perhaps convince this equation to solve itself out of pity, that’d be splendid. Otherwise, maybe just stand there and radiate confusion—it’s clearly working for you.""

The Seeker is speechless. They try to think of a good comeback but nothing comes to mind. The offended Seeker climbs back up on the Horse.

“Let's not waste any more time, Stranger. She clearly doesn't want our help...”

“The Future of our World depends on this Equation!” cries out the Dolphin. “If I could just understand this, it would solve so many Problems. All I need is some clarity!”

The Seeker sighs and gets back down from the Horse. “Whom does the Grail serve? It serves the Scientist.”

The Cup fills up around 100 ML. The Seeker offers the Chalice with Holy water to the Dolphin. “Here drink. This Water will give you some clarity.”

The Dolphin looks at the Cup with skepticism. She smells the Liquid. “What is this? Is it Coffee?”

“No, it's actually water from the--”

Before the Seeker finishes their sentence, the Dolphin has already emptied the Cup.

“--River of Life...”

The Dolphin has her eyes wide open. She wipes the board clean with a Sponge and starts to scribble new equations. “Why didn't I think about this sooner?! Of course! Now it all makes sense. After isolating celestial mechanics, cross-referencing orbital vectors, and—frankly—surpassing the intellectual limits of my contemporaries, I have arrived at a startling conclusion: the Earth... revolves around the Sun.”

The Seeker and the Stranger continue their journey, leaving the Dolphin-Scientist and her Chalkboard behind.

The scorching sun burns on the skin of the Seeker. Sweat drips from their forehead.

“I am getting real thirsty again... I wonder, if the Grail blesses me with water. Whom does the Grail serve? It serves ME.”

The Cup manifest Seven droplets of Holy Water. The disappointed Seeker sighs, takes the Grail and shakes it above their mouth. The single drops fall on the Seeker's dry tongue.

“The Fisher King was right... This Cup is useless!”

After several hours of riding, a large mountain with a flat top appears on the horizon. It's at the end of the dead River. A Gigantic mesa, as big as a small country. Almost 1,7 Kilometers High. The wide Cliff stretches over the entire horizon. The top of the elevated plateau is green, covered with grass and vegetation.

The Path ahead connects with three other dried-up canals into a pool. At the intersection of the four rivers stands a Gorilla below a streetlamp.

“Hey you,” shouts the Gorilla at the Strangers. The Horse stops.

“Do you have an idea for an app?”

“Umm... What?” asks the Seeker confused.

“All I need is just one clever business idea. Something about fitness. Something about sports. Something about Banana-Milkshakes. Something that gets me chicks. One good idea to make me rich. One good idea to prove to the world that I am more than just a simple Gorilla.”

The Seeker sighs. “Alright... I see... The next one, who wants to sip from my cup. Let's see how much water the Grail blesses you with. Whom does the Grail serve? The Grail serves the common people.”

The Chalice manifests 500 ml of Holy Water.

The Seeker clenches their teeth. 'What?! That dumb Gorilla get's this much?! This is unfair... I don't think it will make a big difference, if I take a small drip before giving it to the Gorilla.'

Just as the Seeker's lips are about to touch the Grail, the Gorilla pulls it out from their hands.

“Hey can I have a taste?”

The Gorilla gulps down 2/3 of the contents, wipes his mouth and returns the Cup with the remaining holy water.

“Thank you. I hope you don't mind. I am a Germaphobe.”

The eyes of the Gorilla lighten up. For a moment he is in awe. The Light Bulb of the streetlamp above suddenly turns on.

“I have the best idea ever. I will make a podcast and talk about stuff like psychedelics, spirituality and mysteries like Atlantis 'n stuff.”

The Seeker drinks the rest of the water, but spits it right out again. “Eww... This tastes awful. What happened to the holy water?”

“It wasn't meant for you,” responds the Stranger. “It spoils if you try to take it from another. Unless it's shared in Love, it will always leave a bitter taste. Just like Energy. Just like Attention. Only share in Love. Not in shallow politeness, not in regret, not in reluctance, not in expectation of any return.”

The Stranger points at the Great Mesa and asks the Gorilla: “Is this where the Tree of Life is hidden?”

“I don't know,” shrugs the Gorilla. “But the river of Life used to flow from up there all the way down. There was a great waterfall. But then the water stopped flowing and the land below turned dry.”

“How do we get up there?” asks the Stranger.

“There is a stair case etched into the stone. Right behind the waterfall. It's the 'Ten Thousand steps to Paradise'. I heard getting up there used to be impossible, when the water was still flowing. Now It's still difficult, but do-able.”

The Seeker and the Stranger pass the gorilla and walk through the dried lake basin. They stop at ancient steps, etched into the rock of the massive sandstone wall. The staircase is a masterwork of masonry.

“Don't you think it's unfair?” asks the Seeker, who struggles to keep up with the Strangers pace on the stairs. “I mean, I shared so much with Strangers and yet when I ask for some holy water, all I get are droplets. Why does the Grail only bless me with so little?”

“You still believe that the Grail serves an individual Person,” points out the Stranger, hopping effortlessly from one step to the next.

“It's your answer to the Grail Question that limits it's output. You need to find an answer, that breaks the limit. Manifest the Holy Water not with a fractured intent, but from a place of wholeness. Because if you share from a state of fragmentation, what you give will also be just as limited. You are not a person, sharing their energy with another person. You are the ONE, sharing Energy of the ONE with the ONE.”

After around three hours of walking upstairs, the Seeker and the Stranger finally arrive at the top of the platform.

.

.

**NEW LOCATION DISCOVERED**

**Paradise**

.

The exhausted Seeker breathes heavily and looks around. Lush fields of Grass and flowers. Flat land, many Kilometers wide. There are many small Trees spread out over the entire platform. Over the edge, a wall of dense, white clouds covers the land below.

In the corner of their eye, the Seeker spots something that looks like a large, green Hose, shining in the sun. It's as tall as a Tree. Neither the beginning, nor end of the structure are visible from where the Seeker stands.

The Stranger investigates the object. “Now I know what blocks the Flow of the River of Life.”

From up close, the Seeker sees that the Hose has scales. It breathes. They follow the direction of the Monsters head. After around Six-Hundred Meters of walking they arrive at a single, giant tree in a field of Grass and Flowers. The Tree has golden leafs and violet apples hanging from it. There are many puddles of clear water in the ground.

A never-ending source of the water of Life gushes out from a hole out the bark of the Tree. Like an eternal fountain. The Water fizzes out and lands directly in the open mouth of a giant Serpent, who drinks all the water. The Snake is around Six Meters High.

“What are you doing here?!” shouts the Stranger with a serious voice. His eyes are burning. He unsheathes his swords.

“You don't belong here! This water is not yours alone. It's to be shared with everyone. Your greed destroys the Kingdom. Don't you care about the people you hurt with your selfish actions?”

The Giant Serpent laughs. “Care? You think I care about anyone other than myself? No, this water is mine and mine alone. The only thing I care about is how to clench my endless thirst for more. More pleasure, more power, more possessions. I want everything and I won't stop until everything is mine.”

“I can't allow this to happen. Your selfishness obstructs the flow of the River of Life. People feel depressed, hopeless, sad and tired, because they are disconnected from their source. Your Greed blocks the channel of higher inspiration. It causes a lack of originality, a loss of creativity, a disconnect from spirit.”

The Seeker frowns after listening. “Wait... Are you telling me that he is the reason, why there are no new ideas? Is this why modern art and entertainment lacks meaning? Why all new movies are just hollow reboots? You Monster!”

“What are you gonna do about it?” laughs the twisted tongue mischievously. “You want to drink from Source? Only over my dead body! I am the biggest and strongest creature in this Garden. All who challenged me in the past have perished. You have no chance.”

The Seeker clenches their fist. “Are you the Reason why the 'Rings of Power' turned out to be such a disappointment? If you really are responsible, then it's now personal!”

The Stranger pulls back the Seeker and takes a step forward, standing protectively in front of them. “You are not ready to face such a challenge just yet. On the level down there perhaps. But up here, the challenge is mine. I need to fight the Serpent myself. Just as I respect your right to grow from your own challenges, I ask you to respect mine and not interfere in this battle.”

The Seeker nods. The Stranger takes a fighting stance. “This is your last chance! Go away, Now! Leave this place now peacefully or I will throw you out with force!”

The Giant Serpent laughs. “How cute... You really think you can---”

Suddenly the Serpent is taken by surprise, as the Stranger pulls down his hood and reveals his face. The Serpent hisses both out of fear and anger. Within the fracture of a Second, the Snake goes for a bite with his sharp fangs. But the Stranger blocks the teeth of the Beast with his swords.

“Well,” hisses the twisted tongue with a smirk. “Looks like you don't belong here either.”

The Serpent spews out a beam of water. The color of the water is tainted black. The Stranger dodges just in time.

“I know who you are,” shouts the Stranger. “I know what you represent. I see you, even when you hide yourself in a false light. Your reign ends now, your time is over.”

The Words of the Stranger burns in the air like fire. His Sword of Truth glows Blue. The left Sword glows red. He swings his swords against the Monster's neck. The Great Beast dodges.

“If you think Humanity stands any chance, you are deluding yourself. Humanity is far too lost. It's too late to change. There is no way.”

The Serpent attacks again with his fangs, the Stranger dodges, swings his swords and cuts the Monster's neck.

“There always is a way,” shouts the Stranger with burning eyes. His words ignite fire in the air.

The Serpent bleeds, his blood his black. “Nothing is permanent. Every house you build will fall apart. Everyone you know will die. Every Memory you cling to, will one day be forgotten. Everything you do is meaningless.”

“No,” grins the Stranger and swings his blue sword against the Monster's neck. “The world might be meaningless, but that's why I am here to create meaning.”

With a clean hit, the Stranger chops off the Serpents heavy head. The Beast is slain. The blocked Source is cleared. The Water of Life flows anew.

As the floodgates open, new water flows out of the Tree of Life all the way back to the edge of the mountain. Down at the bottom, the Gorilla stares in astonishment as the waterfall is fueled by a new wave of water. The water flows through the country. Wherever the wave of water flows, Life returns in the surrounding area. New grass, trees and flowers grow instantly wherever the water returns. The Dolphin welcomes the new wave and surfs on her chalkboard. The Bird-of-Paradise takes his completed artwork and views the river from above. In Corbenic, the hidden castle, the Fisher King get's up from his Throne to witness the return of the water of Life from his balcony.

Back at the mountain summit, the Seeker stares at the Tree from which an infinite source of holy water flows. The Seeker is captivated by the archetypal sight. It stirs something deep within the Seeker. The clouds at the edge of the Mesa create an eerie atmosphere.

“This reminds me of a vague dream... The Tree, the fountain of water... It all feels so familiar... Have I been here before?”

“Few people ever been here,” responds the Stranger. “I think Plato visited this place in a dream once. Then there was this one Celtic Druid who traveled here through the Astral Realm. A few Kabbalists, Sufis and Mystics also had visions of this place. Although it's not really a place. It's a unconscious representation of something primal, something ancient, something sacred. A memory deep ingrained in our collective consciousness. This is the Point where our world is projected like a hologram from Infinity. This is from where Reality is streamed.

Fill your Chalice with water directly from Source. Pure, unfiltered essence directly from the infinite Source of Life. Then ask the Grail Question directly to the Cup itself and drink its holy water. It will then reveal to you the true Answer to the great Question through visions and images.”

The Seeker approaches the Tree of Life and holds their cup in the source of the water of Life. When the Grail is full, the Seeker holds it up high above their head and asks:

“Whom does the Grail serve?”

The Seeker drinks from the Crystal clear water. The Seeker feels an overflow of Universal Love, a connection to the Source of Being. The Quietness of the Lucid Moment. A Moment in time between moments. When there is only Presence.

The Seeker feels a connection to all, that is. Awareness extends over all surroundings. Awareness of the Birds, of the Trees, of the Sky. And the Seeker recognizes themselves in all observations. The Seekers awareness extends over to all animals, to all beings on the world. It's as if the Seeker feels an influx of Memories and experiences. For one moment, the Seeker stares directly into the heart of infinity. The Unlimited from which the limited is projected. The Still-point of Infinity from where the Holy Water is spawned. And the Seeker is one with everything.

“Now I know the answer to the Grail question,” speaks the Seeker with burning eyes.

Suddenly a loud sounds grabs the Seeker's and the Strangers attention. Out of the Serpent's cut off neck, two new heads grow. A deadly wound, healed. “You really thought this would be enough to end me? No, it only made me stronger.”

From both heads the Serpent spews out Black, oily liquid. Corrupted water from the source. The Stranger dodges the first beam and pushes away the Seeker.

The Stranger takes a deep breath in, then he holds it and pushes out the breath. He exhales a burning orb through his mouth and lets it flow back through his nose, as it circles vertically like an infinity pattern in and out. After the Twelfth Breath, he takes in a last deep Breath, lets the energy flow down into his root Chakra, holds it and pulls it back up.

A new flame ignites in the Strangers eye. His Aura becomes visible like a flame around his body. A flame that gets stronger and stronger. The aura takes on a new form. The Form of a Mythical Beast. A Sphinx, a cherub, a winged Lion. Standing upright like a swordsman. Equipped with armor and with two swords mirroring the Stranger. The etheric form is a visible layer of blue, red and yellow energy patterns.

With his new form, the Stranger faces the giant two-headed Serpent. The wall of energy around the Stranger shields him from damage. The Sphinx strikes the Serpent with his sword. An epic battle ensues. The Serpent bites, chokes or shoots out Corrupted waters with two heads. The Stranger dodges the attacks when he is attentive and gets hit when he is distracted. The Stranger adapts. Learning from each hit. He maintains his attention even longer.

The Stranger enters flowstate. Every attack is countered with a swordstrike. Using the environment to his advantage. The Stranger pushes the Serpent ever closer to the edge of the Mesa, as he overwhelms the Beast, with his streak of fast sword strikes.

Driven into a corner, the Two-headed Serpent attacks the Stranger's Spirit Armor. The Stranger ignites both Swords, in red and blue flames. With one strong cut, he severs off both heads and the Serpent over the edge.

“You will regret this! I will Destroy you! Hear me?! I will make you pay.”

“You are banned from this place,” speaks the Stranger and watches over the serpents downfall.

As soon as the presence of the Snake is gone, the place lights up. A looming shadow that once threw shade on paradise is now banished. The River of Life flows again. Holy water streams down the waterfalls and splits in the valley below into Four Rivers.

“How do we get back down there?” asks the Seeker the Stranger.

“Easy,” grins the Stranger. “All we need is a boat that never sinks.”

The Stranger reveals a wooden boat behind a bush. The Seeker wonders where it suddenly came from. Together with the Seeker, they drag the boat into the water stream and enter it.

“You really sure this Boat will survive the waterfall?” questions the Seeker nervously.

“Be Love and no matter where you are on the river of Life, you will always flow in the right direction. Be Love when we fall over the cliff. Be Love when the boat hits the lakes surface. Be Love all the way through the process. Even during the scary moments.”

The Boat tips over the edge. Falling down 1.7 Kilometers. As they fall, the Seeker screams in fear of Death. The Stranger however laughs manically like a madman.

“Remember Seeker,” shouts the Stranger in the falling boat. “Be Love. Even Now!”

The Seeker takes in a deep breath and with burning eyes, the Seeker speaks: “Love is, when Fear is not!”

Suddenly, just before the boat hits the Lake, it stops mid-air, levitates for a moment above the water surface and then drops into the stream with little impact.

“What the hell did just happen?” asks the Seeker confused. “How are we still alive?”

“Didn't you know?” grins the Stranger. “This is a magical Boat.”

The Boat floats down the river stream. Wherever it flows, there is new nature blossoming. Trees with new life, Grass, Flowers, Insects, Birds, Animals. There is even fish in the water. Life has returned to a Land that was starving.

Along the River they see the Gorilla, the Dolphin and the Bird-of-Paradise. The Gorilla is now a famous Podcaster, the Scientist receives an award and the artist has his first exhibition.

The Boat floats for sometime along the river, until there appears a castle on the horizon. The Seeker and the Stranger tie the boat to a pier and enter into the castle.

**NEW LOCATION DISCOVERED:**

**Corbenic**

.

.

The Seeker walks with the Chalice in his hand to the Throne of the Fisher King.

“Have you found the True Answer to the Grail Question?” asks the elderly King.

“Yes,” affirms the Seeker with determination.

The King smirks. “Then whom does the Grail serve?”

“The Grail serves ALL,” responds the Seeker with a powerful voice. The Fire in their eyes glow up for a moment.

Holy water suddenly bubbles up in the cup out of nowhere and overflows the Grail. An infinite source of Water. Just like the Source of the River of Life, it won't stop flowing.

“You can have your Grail back,” speaks the Seeker and hands the overflowing Chalice to the King. “When I drank directly from Source, I felt how we are all connected. For a moment I saw through the eyes of All at once. All those Seekers out there. I looked into their heart and I realized, that they are all worth it. Even if they don't realize it about themselves. Every single one is worthy to drink from this water of Life. And it's only our own perceived unworthiness, that cuts us off from this eternal Stream of Life, that we desire so badly without even knowing it. I want this Grail to serve as many people as it can. I think it's better kept in your hands. So take it, as a King you...”

“Don't worry, you can keep it... I still have like a dozen Holy Grails left... Consider it a promotional gift. The Next one will cost you though. They are available in Five different colors.”

The Fisher King points at a corner where several Chalices are displayed on a cabinet. There are golden cups, silver cups, red cups, blue cups and black cups. Each Grail-version is shaped differently.

.

**Mission Accomplished:**

**The Source of the River of Life**

.

The Seeker and the Stranger leave the Castle and get back up on their white horse. They continue their journey through a land, where Life blossoms up anew. Where the rivers of Life flow again through once barren landscapes.

“If you want to learn a technique that helps you to perpetuate the flow of higher energy, you should look into the Infinity Breath technique,” speaks the Stranger, as he rides the horse through the .

“The Yogis have been using this technique to synchronize themselves with the flow of Divine Energy since ancient times. Through the Infinity Breath the River of Life flows through you. Unite the Microcosm and the Macrocosm within you, through your breath and tap into the vast storehouse of infinite energy. Master the infinity Breath and synchronize your energetic body to the flow of the River of Life.”

The Seeker has a question but suddenly something else catches their attention. A hot air balloon suddenly crashes right in front of their horse. The Shrinking bag covers four figures, who struggle against the deflated balloon.

Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan emerge from below the deflated balloon. It's the **NEW-AGE-AWAKENED-RESISTANCE-TURTLES.**

D'Artagnan grabs the Seeker's shoulder. “Seeker! It's time to wake up! You are trapped in a simulation!”

1kpvjwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskOldPeopleAdvice/comments/1kpvjwn/what_does_this_behavior_signal_to_you/,what does this behavior signal to you?,"I (24F) met my boyfriend (26M) last year in August through online dating, and we became exclusive the first time we met in that same month. Note: we are long distance / 2 states away. 

Our first phone call before we met, he gave me his life story. Dumped it all on me about his alcoholic mother and her issues, his depression, past relationship w mushrooms, work, and finally, his ex. 

He told me about her job and status (here on visa) their relationship, how long it lasted, the fact that they broke up amicably 2.5 years ago, and how she had moved states away after everything was said and done bc she didn’t have any other roots in his state besides him. He also mentioned how if she ever asked for a favor within reason, he would help her out. I thought this was kind, especially given her circumstances, but it still rubbed me the wrong way. They’d been broken up for 2.5 years by that point — why would helping her still be a concern of his?

I then asked if they’d gotten close to marriage since they had moved in together, gotten a pet together, etc. and he said, “i would have married her, had things been different.” since he made it clear to me he dates to marry. I don’t know exactly what those “things” are, but I’m assuming just their differences as people and the fact that he claimed he’d fallen out of love with her 6 months before he broke up with her - but stood with her bc they still had a great friendship. There weren’t huge issues, he told me, just that she wasn’t his person. He said she had become a chore for him, she wasn’t working on personal growth, they’d both stopped initiating intimacy, and that the catalyst for the breakup was her trying to get him to sign sponsorship papers (and lying to him about what they were in the process) since marriage wasn’t apart of the conversation. A few weeks later, he told her their relationship wasn’t working and asked her to try and leave within a couple months. She ended up staying longer bc of leasing issues, and he told me that he’d check in with her weekly to see how she was adjusting, if she’d found work, etc. She eventually stopped replying bc she got a new boyfriend, and he let her be. 

This was a lot to take in first phone call, but I rolled with it. It did end up being an issue later on down the line, though. 

Here are some examples of comments he made 

- they were still friends on social media but didn’t interact 
- Hadn’t talked in years 
- I once mentioned I looked her up since he’d mentioned her by name, and I said she was “mid” (meaning not ugly but not very pretty) and he said that I was a lot prettier than her (direct comparison)
- can’t exactly remember the order of events here, but I think we were either talking about my life goal of becoming a lawyer, and he told me he really admired my drive and commitment, which was great! Until he compared me to her again and said, “my ex didn’t really have that” … can’t you compliment me without comparing me to her?
- Randomly brought up his ex’s new boyfriend (can’t remember context) because he built cars and asked me if I knew he (my bf) was also “really into cars,” to which I told him that I did not, and he said “my ex’s new boyfriend looks like a dorkier version of me. I’ll have to show you sometime” 
- I brought up mold once and he told me he had experience with black mold bc his ex had flooded their bathroom
- Told me abt how she grew up rich and therefore wasn’t used to doing things for herself (had a cook and maid) and didn’t know how to do things that your average joe did (such as wash a mirror or do the laundry, etc)
- I once mentioned that I’d like for us to have a Sunday morning ritual where we spend time together, and he said his ex had him do the same thing where they’d sit outside together while she had her coffee
- Once mentioned the tv show “FRIENDS” and how a lot of ppl use it to learn English but that I never liked the show myself, and he agreed that he didn’t like it either and was like “my ex used it to learn English”

These are just some examples that come to mind, but I hope everyone can see why I was upset. If the slightest thing reminded him of her, he had no problem telling me and making that connection. Here’s some more information abt his life that maybe can explain some of this behavior:

- before me, he’d only ever had 2 other girlfriends: the one he dated for 3 years above, and another he dated in middle school & hs for just a couple months altogether. 
- He also mentioned the first gf some, like how she cheated on him and how he really liked her personality when they were together, it was the friendship that brought them together, etc. 
- again, he IS an oversharer and went so far as to let his last gf call the one before her and talk. he’s open about that stuff with not many boundaries bc he didn’t know of them himself
- It was also the other girls first relationship. Their relationship was more lax as it was an open one where she got to mess with other girls and he got to sext/touch other women with her as well or flirt on his own 
- He also wanted me to open up abt my past relationships, which I told him I’d do if he asked specific questions. Randomly mentioning them isn’t something I do unless with friends when reminded of something / telling a story 
- Small social circle and told me he didn’t process this with anyone else, only on his own as a self proclaimed “overthinker”

It was my personal belief at first that he wasn’t over his ex of 3 years. Then it turned into me thinking he was over the person, maybe just not what had happened. It’s sad to fall out of love with someone and have to accept the reality that comes with it. Then I thought about the fact that he’s just an oversharer and didn’t know boundaries because he was more lax in his last relationship. Now, I’m also at a point where I realize this last girl ended up setting a standard for him. It doesn’t seem to have been the best one, but nonetheless. 

I guess I’m just asking for opinions and whether or not this seems like a man who was over his ex before he pursued me. He came on strong, driving 7 hours to meet me for the first time and dropping well over $1k to accommodate me by driving, booking hotels near my home so I felt safer meeting him, asking for physical boundaries. He never explicitly made me feel bad about myself, but the comments he made about her made me snowball and compare us to hell. 

This went on for 5 months and month 3 is when I threw the fit and told him I didn’t want to hear about this anymore. The mentions of her decreased months 3-5 and then stopped altogether once he finally understood what these comments did to my mental. ",1,1747605266.0,AskOldPeopleAdvice,0,1.0,False

As I had just arrived, its been only 4 days, so I was searching for good food place in night for dinner. I did found some. Then suddenly a random guy approached me and asked abou me and he said he in enterpreneur and would like to have a coffee with him. I went to have coffee with him at his home(Yes, chat I know this was a very idiotic thing). Then he was just talking about his business and what he does. Suddenly, he said I am cute. I didn't say anything. Then he asked can we kiss? I said I am straight and ran from there. It was good enough that he didnt chase me. I instantly booked my ride and went to my place. But now, I am traumatized. I want to cry, I don't want any males around me. I am seeing his face and what he said to me. Even in my sleep, I woke up from this and needed to vent out.

1.When we last checked in with the Stewart fam, they were wrapping up their 2 week trip to Hawaii.  The final vlog was a B-roll dump of location footage interspersed with exploiting their children, Evan’s parents, and Carlin grinning like a donkey eating briars through it all with a terrible contour job.  The camera spent way too much time on Zade and there were no captions offered… his parents continue to speak to him in baby talk and he continues to struggle and what more can be said?  Help your kid!  Carlin posted several Instagram grid pics featuring her holding her tummy from every angle, Evan’s sisters pretending to like her, and Layla preening for the camera… even laying down like a 90s a super model. It’s easy to see they flew all the way to Hawaii just to stand around and pose.  Carlin makes mini vlogs of all of the same things featured in their youtube vlog, which means there are TWO cameras rolling at all times.  The kids have no escape.  Layla wears a mic for most of the trip and she needs subtitles too.  Carlin promotes the heck out of her Hawaii pictures through her stories bc they just aren’t performing all that well…. The “likes” far outweigh the comments and that means her audience isn’t as engaged as she needs them to be.  If filming every second of this trip, editing and posting aren’t enough, Carlin also manages to film a hair tutorial for Josie’s pool noodle during her trip.  Once she is home from Hawaii, Carlin goes directly to her 20 week anatomy scan.  She posts to her stories that she is “so happy right now” while holding a pink flower.  Is that a clue?  She tells us that the kids are jetlagged and sleeping in while she unboxes PR packages that piled up while they were gone.  Before we know it, she’s back to posting from pilates class.  It’s hard to tell the difference between the Carlin of today and the Kourtney Kardashian from 2010 anymore…. And don’t get me started on Kelly Joe as Kris.  The weekly vlog has Evan talking directly to the camera while the Tesla drives itself.  He’s on his way to meet up with Carlin and pretend that they are young, fresh new parents who have never had an ultrasound before.  The folks working in that office must hate to see their performative butts coming.  We do learn that she will need some follow up testing for a bright spot found on the heart, and to get other measurements they weren’t able to see…Carlin shares this news as if it’s easy, breezy… and I hope that it is.  Trace shows up at their house unexpectedly eating an uncrustable and we are left to wonder why… is he the pool man these days??  Carlin is heading to Lydia’s baby shower with Katie, who is over at the house with Travis.  They say it’s a Bates baby boom and almost half of the shower gusts are pregnant.  That must mean Tori, right?  Carlin and Katie talk about how their mom isn’t home to celebrate Mother’s Day and Evan says he already gave Carlin a gift so he doesn’t need to worry about the holiday.  The four of them prattle on while poor Hailey sleeps on the Stewart’s couch.  That kid has no schedule and has to catch sleep where and when she can in between performing for the camera.  Layla must be in a jet lagged, foul mood bc she is barely filmed in this vlog.  Give ‘em hell Layla!  Evan, Travis and Carlin mention ChatGPT at least 4 times in this vlog… it is obviously top of mind and would explain how these dullards are making it through life.  Carlin has another grid post on IG… this time she’s posing up a storm IN the doctor’s office.  They don’t mention a gender reveal at all, but the tech did write the gender down, so I am sure they will tease the hell out of that.  After all of the excitement of the big vacation, Carlin is suddenly reduced to taking pictures of a blueberry muffin.  This is a special muffin though, because Evan got it for her bc he is always on top of her cravings.  Duh… he knows where his bread is buttered.  Carlin films Layla walking hand in hand with Hailey and Josie’s girls after church.  The gang is all back together.  In big, breaking news, Zade used the word “I” in a sentence.  To celebrate Mother’s Day, Carlin filmed her feet while Layla attempted to paint her toenails and in the background you can hear Zade say what maybe, might be “I love you mom”.  Not “me”… “I”.  Carlin continues to link everything through her Like To Know app and she hasn’t worn one piece of clothing from the BSB in weeks.  There’s another reel posted about the dern anatomy scan and all of the comments guess “BOY”.  They don’t drop a new vlog this week, and we can only hope it’s to be respectful due to her grandfather’s passing.

 
 
2.Katie Clark has no issue grabbing content whenever and wherever it presents itself… like in the middle of church when Hailey makes Harvey laugh.  Surely the other worshippers won’t mind.  After pretending to listen to the sermon, the Clark family poses for photos outside of the church.  I mean… pics or it didn’t happen, right?  Katie shares stories on her IG from her visit to the grandparent’s farm on her way home from North Carolina.  We see Hailey singing and talking to Janie and Katie uses Lawson’s maudlin vocals over it all.  Of course.  Back at home means back to the studio and Hailey has to help her mom sell some stain treatment.  That new white couch is now mostly made up of bottles of stain treatment.  To celebrate Addee finishing up her one year Bible class at Clown College, Katie takes her to get her nails done.  Katie makes it seem as though Addee just walked the stage at Harvard, and in order to get free nails, Addee goes along with it.  Katie has had time to rummage through her North Carolina footage, and makes a reel out of Hailey falling asleep at the table while eating pizza.  Not one supposed grown up at the table helps the child… they are too busy filming it all.  Again, this poor child has no schedule and has been dragged all over the world while trying to just catch a nap. The reel is up close of Hailey only, and it gets over 1,000 shares. The weekly vlog shows them visiting their NC friends who are home builders.  They are so excited to show off the massive mansions featuring safe rooms and… gun ranges.  We see the Clarks pull up the South Carolina farm just as Hospice is there meeting with the family.  That gives Travis time to make an ad for Better Help where he says the same old thing… for 2-4 years he suffered with panic attacks and anxiety but he was cured via Jesus and talking to a mysterious “someone”.  Katie tells us that Poppa Bill’s dementia is progressing rapidly and that Jane is very tired and suffering with a ton of pain.  Katie seems very uncomfortable talking about her grandparents, but Travis has her cornered in the car with the camera smashed in her face.  Back at home the Clarks are keeping JebJud and Addee while Gil and Kelly Joe are foot loose and fancy free on an Alaskan cruise with Lawson.  Addee is apparently now done with college after her one year Bible course.  Obviously, that is plenty of education for her and she’s ready to be married off.  Katie says Travis is “babysitting” so she can get her nails done, and man… he does NOT like that.  He is quick to correct her, on camera once again, and tells her that what he does is called parenting.  Interesting what Travis chooses to leave in these vlogs, isn’t it?  Katie has to cook bc all of the kids are staying there, and hearing the pots rattling means the Stew Crew shows up to eat also.  Travis ends the vlog all by himself doing his weekly car wash.  So interesting.  Katie takes to her IG grid for Mother’s Day, saying how thankful she is for her children and she shares an older picture of her with Kelly saying how blessed she is to have her as a mom.  On a rainy Monday, Katie films the rain while saying she is so blessed to have a roof over head and she never wants to take the “little” things for granted.  That roof is attached to a three quarters of a million dollar home… is that really a “little” thing??  Travis films Katie putting together curtain rods and hanging curtains.  He can’t help bc he is holding the baby…he also films her using the stain treatment… again… and linking every single item in the house.  Carlin forces Katie to go to pilates and she proves she was there by posting her pilates equipment-it’s all linked of course.  Zach comes over to cook noodles for Katie and she posts about it.  Then Zach reposts the post.  Then Katie reposts the repost of her post.  Then Kelly reposts the reposted posts.  I’m dizzy.  Katie is determined that her children are “best friends” and she shows them laughing together again to prove this point.  The latest vlog starts with an ad for Turo.   Travis rented the first car he ever owned to surprise Katie for… Mother’s day??  Anyway, it’s a Jeep and he tells the camera he has a huge surprise for her for Mother’s Day.  He tells Katie to pack for one night and she immediately guesses that they are going to Gatlinburg.  It’s all weird and hurried and cobbled together and is really just a paid partnership for Dollywood which we already know sponsors them.  They load up the kids and check into the DreamMore resort at Dollywood for one night.  Katie has a massage and then they get rained on while trying to film their kids in the middle of the crowded park.  How special… Travis figured out how to turn Mother’s Day into SponCon.  Soon enough they are back at home where they can’t wait to show off the new finished rooms in the insane asylum… I mean new house.  Y’all EVERY single thing is white, beige and cream.  The only color is from the muted green of the fake olive trees.  They even seem washed out in their white shirts in the middle of all of this bland azz boring décor.  Travis ends the vlog by telling us they are heading to Washington State where he will be singing at a few churches.  It’s been said in the past that this is a great way for these wanna be gospel boys to make bank, so Trav is off to get that coin.  Love offerings here he comes!  Will he wind up at the Roloff’s church for a Tori and Zach crossover?   Did Bill’s funeral move the trip?
 
 

 
3.Josie Balka must really be struggling with sickness during the early days of baby #4.  The most she posted for days on end was reposts of her old pool noodle videos.  When all else falls to the wayside… the pool noodle shall not be forgotten.  The Effortless Shop features Josie in what appears to be a new ad with Lydia.  They are both in pajamas and Josie pulled it together enough to make her standard Toddlers and Tiaras faces for the camera.  On Mother’s Day she makes a grid post saying it is a calling to be a mom.  Yea Kelton (booty) calls… and you answer.  Anyway, we see her all dolled up in her hair curler for breakfast in bed, and flowers from the kids who are crawling all over her.  Finally Josie returns full time to social media, just like she always does, with a full face of makeup that she says takes just 5 minutes.  According to Josie, even though she is sick as a dog, she likes to grip the toilet all made up bc it makes her feel better.  Also helping her feel better are the $130 pajamas she is modeling that she would like you to buy.  We see Miles learning to eat, covered in pasta sauce.  Little man better get the hang of it pretty quickly, because he’s about to be replaced.  The entire Balka clan was heading to Hawaii sometime in May… that trip may be interrupted because of the death of Poppa Bill, or maybe it already happened when Josie was radio silent.
 
 

 
4.Alyssa Webster really got her face popped when her favorite coffee shop teamed up with another influencer to do a giveaway.  She was forced to fan girl from afar and like, share, post, mention, tag just like anyone else, in the hopes of winning some prize.  She hasn’t yet figured out that you can’t run with the big dogs while keeping your comments turned off. Carlin must have convinced Alyssa that the “Like To Know” app is the place to be, bc suddenly, she is linking everything through it.  Her profile says she is 5’2” and is a size “XS”.  In jeans she’s a size 0 and her dress size is a 0/2.  Whatever you say, girl.  Anyway, she’s linking everything there, including her kids TWO DOLLAR garanimals shirts.  Carlin must have also taught her how to exploit her kids before selling something because we see the Webster kids at yet another deserted park.  Rhett stumbles about trying to hold onto a ball that is bigger than him.  He’s in black joggers but Alyssa films herself swinging her braid around bc it’s “so hot”.  Later we see the kids all lined up on the hard concrete eating pizza out of a box while John works on their car.  She shows off her garden, but it’s hard to know if the plants are dead or alive bc she filters the color and realness out of everything.  The kids get ice cream in exchange for lining up once again and plastering on those fake smiles by the pool.  Alyssa is way too excited to show off her collection of water bottles that she has placed in a lazy Susan.  Lazy influencer meet lazy Susan.  On Mother’s Day Alyssa posts that it’s a gift to be a mom.  She doesn’t mention her own Mother at all.  In her pictures she matches outfits with the younger two girls, and Allie is leaning as far away from her mom as she possibly can while still remaining in the frame.  She is posing with flowers she says she got from “a girl at church”…. A passive aggressive way to say they dang sure weren’t from Lurch.  Rhett is stuffed into a full on black suit and as always, looks miserable.  He gets his own picture on the grid and a solo pic with John.  Yet another one of the young couples John and Alyssa know from church are getting married… and this time it appears to be in Virginia.  The Websters load up and drive to the wedding… which is another reminder that they go where they want, when they want.  Alyssa shares lots of pictures at the hotel, lining the kids up over and over and taking selfies with her emotional support coffee.  The girls are all in matching outfits at the outdoor event space and we learn that Maci is the flower girl and Rhett is the ring bearer.  They all match, and Rhett is miserable.  It never changes even if the scenery does.  At the wedding we see Maci in a flower girl dress that is absolutely swallowing her and what must be Allie’s shoes.  Poor thing is wearing boats and Rhett is stuffed into cowboy boots.  Alyssa and one of her friends are in the same dress, just different colors and while she shows off the super fancy plastic plates and silverware and a pre-printed menu… the meal is just bbq with mac and cheese.  Alyssa reposts the professional wedding pics that feature Maci stone faced, afraid to move while Rhett has an absolute meltdown and is captured running off crying.  The big question is… will the Websters travel from Virginia back to South Carolina for her granddad’s funeral?  Can she avoid the siblings on her no go list and keep her kids from interacting with the heather cousins?
 
 

 
5.Whitney and Zach have tons of content from their sponsored trip to Lake Havasu and they start with sharing a HACK(“hike” for the rest of us) they went on where Whitney wore a sports bra and short shorts and a $200 pair of sunglasses.  Zach went on the hike in Dockers and top siders and constantly films Whitney from the back where every time the wind blows, you can see her cheeks.  They took a boat ride on the lake and had a fancy Italian dinner while she was wearing a top from the boutique.  At a local taco spot, Zach fully admits that he ordered 2 main courses for himself and then shows Whitney trying to talk with her mouth full.  In Whitney’s ad for the company that sponsored their trip, she says the house slept 14 and shows off a tiny bikini.  In the comments, people say “February baby” coming and she says she “doesn’t think so”.  She uses AI to post about how marriage takes intention and to choose each other every day.  Of course there’s some scammy giveaway attached that they want you to use their code to join.  Whitney shares all of the links from the trip through… you guess it… the Like To Know app.  Zach is constantly on Instagram these days promoting anything not nailed down and I want to see him on Like To Know sharing his sizes…. Zach films from his car which he calls his office and Whitney says meeting Zach while working at Sonic was the butterfly effect while showing the two of them piled up on each other in a hammock.  They are really pushing this narrative that they are hot and heavy in love.  They are constantly tagging each other and reposting each other’s content and commenting to each other through Instagram.  It’s definitely a hard sell.  Zach promotes a Lake Havasu restaurant that comped their meal and Whitney wants you to buy a $110 blanket from one of her influencer friends.  In the Bates Kitchen, Zach has the Flat Top King over to teach him how to make omelettes.  It’s a 40 minute video about eggs.  Zach has cut his thumb one more time, so he’s cooking with open wounds yet again.  He tells this chef that they were so broke growing up they sometimes only had eggs to eat from the chickens they raised…somewhere Gil Bates is cringing.  Anyway, Zach tests out new seasonings by pouring them in his hand and then LICKING THEM OFF.  Over and over…. Without ever washing his hands.  The Flat Top King seems less than impressed with his student.  Zach shows off Brad’s last soccer game and breakfast for the fam outside… he also goes on youtube to apologize for being late with his video.  Travis does this also and you have to wonder if people are really blowing him up about uploading another kitchen nightmare. Whitney is back in her car, talking to the phone while driving, fully gesturing with her hands.  She says she is on the way to Lydia’s shower and says they have been crazy busy but have just a month until they invade my space and head to Folly Beach.  On Mother’s Day she says they are loading up and heading to the farm in South Carolina to say their goodbyes to Zach’s granddad.  She shows them surprising her mom at her job at Belk department store and her mom is excited to see all of the kids.  Zach shows the family at Waffle House and wishes a Happy Mother’s Day to Whitney and to “all moms”.  The Lake Havasu content just keeps coming, this time from Zach who talks about how great their marriage is when they just “slow down”.  As if it’s someone else’s fault that they have 5 kids.  The Bates Kitchen is back with a recipe of noodles and cheese… again.  We’ve seen this same recipe done about 85 different ways.  It’s just more of Zach slinging cheese all over the kitchens, heavy breathing and playing with knives.  He doesn’t mention his granddad passing away.
 
 

 
6.Trace and Lydia are squeezing everything they can out of their Florida trip, along with constantly telling us how close she is to giving birth.  In reality, she has more than a month, but she is praying to go early.  I’ll pray with her.  She’s selling makeup now by filming herself putting it on in the bathroom mirror.  We also see Trace carrying Ryker around on the beach to pick up shells because he hates the sand so much.  She shares the link to the house they stayed in… it’s $5600 for the week.  In her grid post she wears a see through dress and posts blurry pictures ala Josie.  Ryker seems happy to be back at home with his toys and Maui.  Lydia films herself in 3 different dresses and asks her followers to vote on which one she should wear.  She ends up wearing the dress that had the least amount of votes and was least appropriate for the event.  It’s a body con dress with a weird neck sash and she couples it with an updo straight out of 2005.  Their vlog starts at the doctor’s office for Lydia’s last ultrasound.  Trace films himself in the waiting room with his big ole feet propped up on the chair and other patients in the background.  Lydia tells us she had been to the office earlier that day with Josie.  After the uneventful appointment, Trace heads off to help Lydia’s family at their farm.  While wearing a mic clipped to his hat, he shovels and shows off the new barn they are building.  Obviously, they aren’t expecting to go anywhere.  Trace says that Josie is throwing a baby sprinkle, instead of a shower, for Lydia and he knows it will be fantastic because “anything Josie does is incredible”.  Read: RICH. Josie has rented that bare warehouse space once again and draped everything in white with a few pastel colors mixed in.  Carlin takes over the filming and narrating for Lydia.  It’s just a small group there, and Kelly Joe missed it for her Alaska trip.  They all make flower bouquets to take home.  Lydia’s mom gives a baby blessing and they have to bleep out the baby’s name.  She prays that the baby is a joyful, happy girl.  Keep sweet, you know.  Trace wishes Lydia a Happy Mother’s Day and reminds us all that at 35 weeks pregnant, she is still in the weight room slinging weights around.  Lydia films a day at home where Trace attempts to read a book to Ryker, the cat snoozes and she shows off the reel they made in Hawaii when they rolled out of bed and she pee’d on a stick.  Even after we know that Poppa Bill has passed away, Lydia continues to share content…. She shows Ryker and Trace getting the exact same haircut, and her all-important bag getting packed for the hospital.  They drop a weekly vlog that is just Lydia putting way too much crap in a suitcase to drag to the hospital and Trace clipping the car seat into the car.  Lydia thought it would take him much longer to do, but he reminds her that he quite literally just did this.  Paint drying or golf would be more exciting to watch than these 2.  


 
 
7.Michael and Brandon take a hike with another couple to a waterfall, and she shows off time spent with Zach’s kids and with baby Harvey.  In a new vlog they recap their trip to Florida to meet Brandon’s sister’s new baby.  Brandon’s sister Christy picks them up from the airport and they joke about how much they look alike.  This sister works in the ministry… it isn’t clear what ministry they are referring to.  We see them ooh and aah over the new baby and then Brandon says he’s going to dispel any awkwardness by explaining that this isn’t hard for them or awful.  Michael says it actually increases her faith to see others have their prayers answered.  She says it makes her want to pray harder.  She says she knows something good is coming, and Brandon says God is still working.  Even though they say all of that… it’s hard not to feel sad when Michael cuddles baby after baby after baby… just to hand them back.  Michael wishes her mom a Happy Mother’s Day and says she is spending the day with Janie.  She also raves over Brandon’s mom.  Michael shows a sunset and a rainbow that she says she captured on her way home… it seems to be soon after Poppa Bill passed away.
 
 

 
8.Erin shows off pictures from her anatomy scan so she must be pretty close to Carlin with her pregnancy.  She says they are having a wonderful lunch outside to celebrate… its bread and a green kale smoothie.  Later, she shows off chocolate chip cookies and cinnamon rolls while saying its sourdough everything at their house.  Carson Charles (Carles) Paine turns 10 years old the day after Poppa Bill passes away.  Erin says he is perfect like Chad and talks about his faith in Jesus and how he is always with William.  Kid’s been brothermomming for over 5 years now.  On Mother’s Day Erin praises Kelly and Chad’s mom.  Erin is the very first Bates to announce that Bill Bates has passed away.  She gives no details on her vlog, but says she interviewed him a few years back and is going to share that interview. Right off the rip she call herself the favorite granddaughter, and then she does it again and again… and again throughout the video.  Poor Poppa Bill seemed backed into a corner and when Erin admits that she knows he can’t say that she is the favorite… he jokingly says “well I can SAY it…”(he just doesn’t have to mean it).  She calls him brilliant and frugal.  He says in marriage you must be patient, and then the whole thing goes off the rails when he talks about disciplining your children and the right way to spank.  Erin nods along in agreement and says young folks should take his advice.  I mean… she could have cleaned this up a little.  At the time of this interview he had 24 great grandchildren and said he knew many more were on the way.  Erin remembers going to court with him when he was a magistrate.  All in all it seems Bill was a man of few words and he didn’t seem comfortable in front of the camera.  On Instagram, Erin shows the farm and says it’s her favorite place.  We see her kids playing with Tori’s kids, so we know they are there… and have been there.
 

 
 
9.For 2 weeks Lawson has done nothing but promote this song and music video about Poppa Bill Bates.  The song is all about dementia, but many folks take it as a goodbye bc he has died… weeks before he actually does die.  Kelly Joe posts that she is just bawling crying over Lawson’s song.  When they aren’t promoting the song, we are seeing glimpses from their big cruise to Alaska.  Tiffy shows off pictures of her and Callie together sightseeing, and eating pizza.  Callie must have scored an invite as a babysitter for Will on this trip, because JebJud didn’t get to go and are stuck at home with Katie.  It looks like Tiffany’s aunt and uncle are also on the trip, along with her brother.  Being on a cruise doesn’t stop the constant posting of the cringe-worthy reels.  Tiffy posts several including one where she lays her head in Will’s lap to see what he will do.  What he does is slap the snot out of her.  Do it again baby Will!  In another she says Lawson gave her a “little piece of him” so she won’t ever be alone again.  A “little piece”?  You don’t say Tiff.  We see Gil and Kelly Joe on the trip with them and Gil looks exhausted.  Tiffy makes a reel showing clips of herself as a little girl and they all get off of the ship to tour Canada.   On the deck of the ship, Tiffy and Lawson decide to take a picture where she sits on Lawson’s shoulders and baby Will sits on her shoulders. Very dangerous and of course, more of Tiffy appearing to be Lawson’s child.  Tiffany says she was screaming the entire time… well except for when she was grinning for the picture.  It’s the 3rdanniversary of these 2 buffoons and to celebrate, Tiffany promotes Lawson’s sad, sappy song.  After the trip, she says her mom is back in Tennessee with her and she wishes a happy birthday to Carles Paine.  She really picks and chooses who she wishes Happy Birthday.  Tiffany tells us she got to sit first class on the way home, but she didn’t even enjoy it because she couldn’t be with Will and Lawson.  After more than a month, they finally have a new vlog.  It starts with Tiffany being sick and burning up with a fever, but by the next day she is miraculously better.  They are constantly addressing the audience as “guys” and asking stupid questions.  The vlog is mostly the behind the scenes of the music video.  It was filmed after July 4th last year on the farm.  Carlin and Evan are there as cameraman and director and Alyssa is there visiting also.  Back to present time, about a month ago, we see how much Bill has progressed in his illness.  Lawson takes Janie to her treatments and sits on the porch with Bill.  Lawson talks nonstop for more than ten minutes while Bill mostly nods in agreement and says “oh boy”.  Bless his heart.  Tiffany tries to humble brag that baby Will’s picture is the only one of a great grand up on the wall.  She says this while over her shoulder we see a picture of Nathan holding Kenna.  Both Lawson and Tiffany take to Instagram to ask for prayers for a friend who has passed away.  It appears to be their pastor’s wife from a church in San Diego.  Even after Poppa Bill passes away, Tiffany and Lawson continue to share content on social media.  We see baby Will watching the movie Sandlot, laughing and clapping and another reel where Tiff says Lawson pays the mortgage, all of the bills, their health insurance and still goes to fetch her treats. Not sure what she is trying to prove, but he must have a money tree in the backyard that Duke guards for him… In his music video for the poppa Bill song he points to his watch when talking about the time and holds up five fingers for 1995… I never realized my work paid that well.  Tiffany wants everyone to know she is hanging out with Erin and Tori so she tagged them over the picture of a Starbucks drink thanking them for bringing it to her.




10.The Bates Sisters  Boutique is truly grasping at straws these days… They participate in a local small business giveaway to try and drive customers to their website. Before Mother’s Day, they announce that unfortunately they have had trouble getting in their mommy and me dresses. They are only able to get two styles, one pink and one blue… The entire campaign lands with a thud.  People comment that these dresses have been available on the site and they aren’t new… The Boutique comments back, apologizing that it just didn’t work out.  The dresses are $78 each and the kids styles are $45 each. The boutique features a ton of new models and drops and Americana line of clothing… Everything is red white and blue and severely overpriced $85 for a dress and $50 for a sleeveless top.  The girls now running the shop show off the crumble cookies that they say vendors brought to them and later they chopped the prices of everything on the website to almost $10 apiece. They announce another cash and Cari coming at the end of June and you just have to wonder how long can they keep this up?  Meanwhile, Kelly Joe Bates continues trying to become a late in life influencer and momager.  She reposts every Vlog all of her children have shared for the last month and raves over every one of them. She says she’s getting caught up on the plane ride home from her trip. Kelly says the trip was a gift to her and Gil from Lawson and Tiffany, and it was a trip of a lifetime… More of that mystery Lawson Bates money. Kelly says they are heading straight to the farm because Bill has taken a turn for the worst. She thanks Ellie for posting about her on Mother’s Day and says she does not deserve Ellie‘s love and apologizes for all the mistakes they made while parenting. Interesting, right? Is she apologizing for raising her children in a cult?? All of the kids who publicly said happy Mother’s Day to Kelly get a public thank you from Kelly.  She posts a long post about her own mother and talks about how she and momma Jane have become best friends in the past year… says there’s nowhere she would rather be than on the farm spending time with Bill and Jane (no mention of Gil!!). She wishes a happy anniversary to Lawson and Tiffany and happy birthday to Carles Paine.  Kelly calls Lawson and Tiffany a sweet little couple and says that Tiffany is a wonderful little Wife. There’s that word again… Esther pops up on social media to thank Nathan for the steak dinner. He cooked for Mother’s Day and she lets us know that happy Allen is now crawling.



It was a lot of absolutely nothing to get caught up on friends! Have an amazing week!

1kpvget,https://www.reddit.com/r/BringingUpBates/comments/1kpvget/breaking_down_bates/,Breaking Down Bates,"1.When we last checked in with the Stewart fam, they were wrapping up their 2 week trip to Hawaii.  The final vlog was a B-roll dump of location footage interspersed with exploiting their children, Evan’s parents, and Carlin grinning like a donkey eating briars through it all with a terrible contour job.  The camera spent way too much time on Zade and there were no captions offered… his parents continue to speak to him in baby talk and he continues to struggle and what more can be said?  Help your kid!  Carlin posted several Instagram grid pics featuring her holding her tummy from every angle, Evan’s sisters pretending to like her, and Layla preening for the camera… even laying down like a 90s super model. It’s easy to see they flew all the way to Hawaii just to stand around and pose.  Carlin makes mini vlogs of all of the same things featured in their youtube vlog, which means there are TWO cameras rolling at all times.  The kids have no escape.  Layla wears a mic for most of the trip and she needs subtitles too.  Carlin promotes the heck out of her Hawaii pictures through her stories bc they just aren’t performing all that well…. The “likes” far outweigh the comments and that means her audience isn’t as engaged as she needs them to be.  If filming every second of this trip, editing and posting aren’t enough, Carlin also manages to film a hair tutorial for Josie’s pool noodle during her trip.  Once she is home from Hawaii, Carlin goes directly to her 20 week anatomy scan.  She posts to her stories that she is “so happy right now” while holding a pink flower.  Is that a clue?  She tells us that the kids are jetlagged and sleeping in while she unboxes PR packages that piled up while they were gone.  Before we know it, she’s back to posting from pilates class.  It’s hard to tell the difference between the Carlin of today and the Kourtney Kardashian from 2010 anymore…. And don’t get me started on Kelly Joe as Kris.  The weekly vlog has Evan talking directly to the camera while the Tesla drives itself.  He’s on his way to meet up with Carlin and pretend that they are young, fresh new parents who have never had an ultrasound before.  The folks working in that office must hate to see their performative butts coming.  We do learn that she will need some follow up testing for a bright spot found on the heart, and to get other measurements they weren’t able to see…Carlin shares this news as if it’s easy, breezy… and I hope that it is.  Trace shows up at their house unexpectedly eating an uncrustable and we are left to wonder why… is he the pool man these days??  Carlin is heading to Lydia’s baby shower with Katie, who is over at the house with Travis.  They say it’s a Bates baby boom and almost half of the shower guests are pregnant.  That must mean Tori, right?  Carlin and Katie talk about how their mom isn’t home to celebrate Mother’s Day and Evan says he already gave Carlin a gift so he doesn’t need to worry about the holiday.  The four of them prattle on while poor Hailey sleeps on the Stewart’s couch.  That kid has no schedule and has to catch sleep where and when she can in between performing for the camera.  Layla must be in a jet lagged, foul mood bc she is barely filmed in this vlog.  Give ‘em hell Layla!  Evan, Travis and Carlin mention ChatGPT at least 4 times in this vlog… it is obviously top of mind and would explain how these dullards are making it through life.  Carlin has another grid post on IG… this time she’s posing up a storm IN the doctor’s office.  They don’t mention a gender reveal at all, but the tech did write the gender down, so I am sure they will tease the hell out of that.  After all of the excitement of the big vacation, Carlin is suddenly reduced to taking pictures of a blueberry muffin.  This is a special muffin though, because Evan got it for her bc he is always on top of her cravings.  Duh… he knows where his bread is buttered.  Carlin films Layla walking hand in hand with Hailey and Josie’s girls after church.  The gang is all back together.  In big, breaking news, Zade used the word “I” in a sentence.  To celebrate Mother’s Day, Carlin filmed her feet while Layla attempted to paint her toenails and in the background you can hear Zade say what maybe, might be “I love you mom”.  Not “me”… “I”.  Carlin continues to link everything through her Like To Know app and she hasn’t worn one piece of clothing from the BSB in weeks.  There’s another reel posted about the dern anatomy scan and all of the comments guess “BOY”.  They don’t drop a new vlog this week, and we can only hope it’s to be respectful due to her grandfather’s passing.

 
 
2.Katie Clark has no issue grabbing content whenever and wherever it presents itself… like in the middle of church when Hailey makes Harvey laugh.  Surely the other worshippers won’t mind.  After pretending to listen to the sermon, the Clark family poses for photos outside of the church.  I mean… pics or it didn’t happen, right?  Katie shares stories on her IG from her visit to the grandparent’s farm on her way home from North Carolina.  We see Hailey singing and talking to Janie and Katie uses Lawson’s maudlin vocals over it all.  Of course.  Back at home means back to the studio and Hailey has to help her mom sell some stain treatment.  That new white couch is now mostly made up of bottles of stain treatment.  To celebrate Addee finishing up her one year Bible class at Clown College, Katie takes her to get her nails done.  Katie makes it seem as though Addee just walked the stage at Harvard, and in order to get free nails, Addee goes along with it.  Katie has had time to rummage through her North Carolina footage, and makes a reel out of Hailey falling asleep at the table while eating pizza.  Not one supposed grown up at the table helps the child… they are too busy filming it all.  Again, this poor child has no schedule and has been dragged all over the world while trying to just catch a nap. The reel is up close of Hailey only, and it gets over 1,000 shares. The weekly vlog shows them visiting their NC friends who are home builders.  They are so excited to show off the massive mansions featuring safe rooms and… gun ranges.  We see the Clarks pull up to the South Carolina farm just as Hospice is there meeting with the family.  That gives Travis time to make an ad for Better Help where he says the same old thing… for 2-4 years he suffered with panic attacks and anxiety but he was cured via Jesus and talking to a mysterious “someone”.  Katie tells us that Poppa Bill’s dementia is progressing rapidly and that Jane is very tired and suffering with a ton of pain.  Katie seems very uncomfortable talking about her grandparents, but Travis has her cornered in the car with the camera smashed in her face.  Back at home the Clarks are keeping JebJud and Addee while Gil and Kelly Joe are foot loose and fancy free on an Alaskan cruise with Lawson.  Addee is apparently now done with college after her one year Bible course.  Obviously, that is plenty of education for her and she’s ready to be married off.  Katie says Travis is “babysitting” so she can get her nails done, and man… he does NOT like that.  He is quick to correct her, on camera once again, and tells her that what he does is called parenting.  Interesting what Travis chooses to leave in these vlogs, isn’t it?  Katie has to cook bc all of the kids are staying there, and hearing the pots rattling means the Stew Crew shows up to eat also.  Travis ends the vlog all by himself doing his weekly car wash.  So interesting.  Katie takes to her IG grid for Mother’s Day, saying how thankful she is for her children and she shares an older picture of her with Kelly saying how blessed she is to have her as a mom.  On a rainy Monday, Katie films the rain while saying she is so blessed to have a roof over head and she never wants to take the “little” things for granted.  That roof is attached to a three quarters of a million dollar home… is that really a “little” thing??  Travis films Katie putting together curtain rods and hanging curtains.  He can’t help bc he is holding the baby…he also films her using the stain treatment… again… and linking every single item in the house.  Carlin forces Katie to go to pilates and she proves she was there by posting her pilates equipment-it’s all linked of course.  Zach comes over to cook noodles for Katie and she posts about it.  Then Zach reposts the post.  Then Katie reposts the repost of her post.  Then Kelly reposts the reposted posts.  I’m dizzy.  Katie is determined that her children are “best friends” and she shows them laughing together again to prove this point.  The latest vlog starts with an ad for Turo.   Travis rented the first car he ever owned to surprise Katie for… Mother’s day??  Anyway, it’s a Jeep and he tells the camera he has a huge surprise for her for Mother’s Day.  He tells Katie to pack for one night and she immediately guesses that they are going to Gatlinburg.  It’s all weird and hurried and cobbled together and is really just a paid partnership for Dollywood which we already know sponsors them.  They load up the kids and check into the DreamMore resort at Dollywood for one night.  Katie has a massage and then they get rained on while trying to film their kids in the middle of the crowded park.  How special… Travis figured out how to turn Mother’s Day into SponCon.  Soon enough they are back at home where they can’t wait to show off the new finished rooms in the insane asylum… I mean new house.  Y’all EVERY single thing is white, beige and cream.  The only color is from the muted green of the fake olive trees.  They even seem washed out in their white shirts in the middle of all of this bland azz boring décor.  Travis ends the vlog by telling us they are heading to Washington State where he will be singing at a few churches.  It’s been said in the past that this is a great way for these wanna be gospel boys to make bank, so Trav is off to get that coin.  Love offerings here he comes!  Will he wind up at the Roloff’s church for a Tori and Zach crossover?   Did Bill’s funeral move the trip?
 
 

 
3.Josie Balka must really be struggling with sickness during the early days of baby #4.  The most she posted for days on end was reposts of her old pool noodle videos.  When all else falls to the wayside… the pool noodle shall not be forgotten.  The Effortless Shop features Josie in what appears to be a new ad with Lydia.  They are both in pajamas and Josie pulled it together enough to make her standard Toddlers and Tiaras faces for the camera.  On Mother’s Day she makes a grid post saying it is a calling to be a mom.  Yea Kelton (booty) calls… and you answer.  Anyway, we see her all dolled up in her hair curler for breakfast in bed, and flowers from the kids who are crawling all over her.  Finally Josie returns full time to social media, just like she always does, with a full face of makeup that she says takes just 5 minutes.  According to Josie, even though she is sick as a dog, she likes to grip the toilet all made up bc it makes her feel better.  Also helping her feel better are the $130 pajamas she is modeling that she would like you to buy.  We see Miles learning to eat, covered in pasta sauce.  Little man better get the hang of it pretty quickly, because he’s about to be replaced.  The entire Balka clan was heading to Hawaii sometime in May… that trip may be interrupted because of the death of Poppa Bill, or maybe it already happened when Josie was radio silent.
 
 

 
4.Alyssa Webster really got her face popped when her favorite coffee shop teamed up with another influencer to do a giveaway.  She was forced to fan girl from afar and like, share, post, mention, tag just like anyone else, in the hopes of winning some prize.  She hasn’t yet figured out that you can’t run with the big dogs while keeping your comments turned off. Carlin must have convinced Alyssa that the “Like To Know” app is the place to be, bc suddenly, she is linking everything through it.  Her profile says she is 5’2” and is a size “XS”.  In jeans she’s a size 0 and her dress size is a 0/2.  Whatever you say, girl.  Anyway, she’s linking everything there, including her kids TWO DOLLAR garanimals shirts.  Carlin must have also taught her how to exploit her kids before selling something because we see the Webster kids at yet another deserted park.  Rhett stumbles about trying to hold onto a ball that is bigger than him.  He’s in black joggers but Alyssa films herself swinging her braid around bc it’s “so hot”.  Later we see the kids all lined up on the hard concrete eating pizza out of a box while John works on their car.  She shows off her garden, but it’s hard to know if the plants are dead or alive bc she filters the color and realness out of everything.  The kids get ice cream in exchange for lining up once again and plastering on those fake smiles by the pool.  Alyssa is way too excited to show off her collection of water bottles that she has placed in a lazy Susan.  Lazy influencer meet lazy Susan.  On Mother’s Day Alyssa posts that it’s a gift to be a mom.  She doesn’t mention her own Mother at all.  In her pictures she matches outfits with the younger two girls, and Allie is leaning as far away from her mom as she possibly can while still remaining in the frame.  She is posing with flowers she says she got from “a girl at church”…. A passive aggressive way to say they dang sure weren’t from Lurch.  Rhett is stuffed into a full on black suit and as always, looks miserable.  He gets his own picture on the grid and a solo pic with John.  Yet another one of the young couples John and Alyssa know from church are getting married… and this time it appears to be in Virginia.  The Websters load up and drive to the wedding… which is another reminder that they go where they want, when they want.  Alyssa shares lots of pictures at the hotel, lining the kids up over and over and taking selfies with her emotional support coffee.  The girls are all in matching outfits at the outdoor event space and we learn that Maci is the flower girl and Rhett is the ring bearer.  They all match, and Rhett is miserable.  It never changes even if the scenery does.  At the wedding we see Maci in a flower girl dress that is absolutely swallowing her and what must be Allie’s shoes.  Poor thing is wearing boats and Rhett is stuffed into cowboy boots.  Alyssa and one of her friends are in the same dress, just different colors and while she shows off the super fancy plastic plates and silverware and a pre-printed menu… the meal is just bbq with mac and cheese.  Alyssa reposts the professional wedding pics that feature Maci stone faced, afraid to move while Rhett has an absolute meltdown and is captured running off crying.  The big question is… will the Websters travel from Virginia back to South Carolina for her granddad’s funeral?  Can she avoid the siblings on her no go list and keep her kids from interacting with the heathen cousins?
 
 

 
5.Whitney and Zach have tons of content from their sponsored trip to Lake Havasu and they start with sharing a HACK(“hike” for the rest of us) they went on where Whitney wore a sports bra and short shorts and a $200 pair of sunglasses.  Zach went on the hike in Dockers and top siders and constantly films Whitney from the back where every time the wind blows, you can see her cheeks.  They took a boat ride on the lake and had a fancy Italian dinner while she was wearing a top from the boutique.  At a local taco spot, Zach fully admits that he ordered 2 main courses for himself and then shows Whitney trying to talk with her mouth full.  In Whitney’s ad for the company that sponsored their trip, she says the house slept 14 and shows off a tiny bikini.  In the comments, people say “February baby” coming and she says she “doesn’t think so”.  She uses AI to post about how marriage takes intention and to choose each other every day.  Of course there’s some scammy giveaway attached that they want you to use their code to join.  Whitney shares all of the links from the trip through… you guessed it… the Like To Know app.  Zach is constantly on Instagram these days promoting anything not nailed down and I want to see him on Like To Know sharing his sizes…. Zach films from his car which he calls his office and Whitney says meeting Zach while working at Sonic was the butterfly effect while showing the two of them piled up on each other in a hammock.  They are really pushing this narrative that they are hot and heavy in love.  They are constantly tagging each other and reposting each other’s content and commenting to each other through Instagram.  It’s definitely a hard sell.  Zach promotes a Lake Havasu restaurant that comped their meal and Whitney wants you to buy a $110 blanket from one of her influencer friends.  In the Bates Kitchen, Zach has the Flat Top King over to teach him how to make omelettes.  It’s a 40 minute video about eggs.  Zach has cut his thumb one more time, so he’s cooking with open wounds yet again.  He tells this chef that they were so broke growing up they sometimes only had eggs to eat from the chickens they raised…somewhere Gil Bates is cringing.  Anyway, Zach tests out new seasonings by pouring them in his hand and then LICKING THEM OFF.  Over and over…. Without ever washing his hands.  The Flat Top King seems less than impressed with his student.  Zach shows off Brad’s last soccer game and breakfast for the fam outside… he also goes on youtube to apologize for being late with his video.  Travis does this also and you have to wonder if people are really blowing him up about uploading another kitchen nightmare. Whitney is back in her car, talking to the phone while driving, fully gesturing with her hands.  She says she is on the way to Lydia’s shower and says they have been crazy busy but have just a month until they invade my space and head to Folly Beach.  On Mother’s Day she says they are loading up and heading to the farm in South Carolina to say their goodbyes to Zach’s granddad.  She shows them surprising her mom at her job at Belk department store and her mom is excited to see all of the kids.  Zach shows the family at Waffle House and wishes a Happy Mother’s Day to Whitney and to “all moms”.  The Lake Havasu content just keeps coming, this time from Zach who talks about how great their marriage is when they just “slow down”.  As if it’s someone else’s fault that they have 5 kids.  The Bates Kitchen is back with a recipe of noodles and cheese… again.  We’ve seen this same recipe done about 85 different ways.  It’s just more of Zach slinging cheese all over the kitchens, heavy breathing and playing with knives.  He doesn’t mention his granddad passing away.
 
 

 
6.Trace and Lydia are squeezing everything they can out of their Florida trip, along with constantly telling us how close she is to giving birth.  In reality, she has more than a month, but she is praying to go early.  I’ll pray with her.  She’s selling makeup now by filming herself putting it on in the bathroom mirror.  We also see Trace carrying Ryker around on the beach to pick up shells because he hates the sand so much.  She shares the link to the house they stayed in… it’s $5600 for the week.  In her grid post she wears a see through dress and posts blurry pictures ala Josie.  Ryker seems happy to be back at home with his toys and Maui.  Lydia films herself in 3 different dresses and asks her followers to vote on which one she should wear.  She ends up wearing the dress that had the least amount of votes and was least appropriate for the event.  It’s a body con dress with a weird neck sash and she couples it with an updo straight out of 2005.  Their vlog starts at the doctor’s office for Lydia’s last ultrasound.  Trace films himself in the waiting room with his big ole feet propped up on the chair and other patients in the background.  Lydia tells us she had been to the office earlier that day with Josie.  After the uneventful appointment, Trace heads off to help Lydia’s family at their farm.  While wearing a mic clipped to his hat, he shovels and shows off the new barn they are building.  Obviously, they aren’t expecting to go anywhere.  Trace says that Josie is throwing a baby sprinkle, instead of a shower, for Lydia and he knows it will be fantastic because “anything Josie does is incredible”.  Read: RICH. Josie has rented that bare warehouse space once again and draped everything in white with a few pastel colors mixed in.  Carlin takes over the filming and narrating for Lydia.  It’s just a small group there, and Kelly Joe missed it for her Alaska trip.  They all make flower bouquets to take home.  Lydia’s mom gives a baby blessing and they have to bleep out the baby’s name.  She prays that the baby is a joyful, happy girl.  Keep sweet, you know.  Trace wishes Lydia a Happy Mother’s Day and reminds us all that at 35 weeks pregnant, she is still in the weight room slinging weights around.  Lydia films a day at home where Trace attempts to read a book to Ryker, the cat snoozes and she shows off the reel they made in Hawaii when they rolled out of bed and she pee’d on a stick.  Even after we know that Poppa Bill has passed away, Lydia continues to share content…. She shows Ryker and Trace getting the exact same haircut, and her all-important bag getting packed for the hospital.  They drop a weekly vlog that is just Lydia putting way too much crap in a suitcase to drag to the hospital and Trace clipping the car seat into the car.  Lydia thought it would take him much longer to do, but he reminds her that he quite literally just did this.  Paint drying or golf would be more exciting to watch than these 2.  


 
 
7.Michael and Brandon take a hike with another couple to a waterfall, and she shows off time spent with Zach’s kids and with baby Harvey.  In a new vlog they recap their trip to Florida to meet Brandon’s sister’s new baby.  Brandon’s sister Christy picks them up from the airport and they joke about how much they look alike.  This sister works in the ministry… it isn’t clear what ministry they are referring to.  We see them ooh and aah over the new baby and then Brandon says he’s going to dispel any awkwardness by explaining that this isn’t hard for them or awful.  Michael says it actually increases her faith to see others have their prayers answered.  She says it makes her want to pray harder.  She says she knows something good is coming, and Brandon says God is still working.  Even though they say all of that… it’s hard not to feel sad when Michael cuddles baby after baby after baby… just to hand them back.  Michael wishes her mom a Happy Mother’s Day and says she is spending the day with Janie.  She also raves over Brandon’s mom.  Michael shows a sunset and a rainbow that she says she captured on her way home… it seems to be soon after Poppa Bill passed away.
 
 

 
8.Erin shows off pictures from her anatomy scan so she must be pretty close to Carlin with her pregnancy.  She says they are having a wonderful lunch outside to celebrate… its bread and a green kale smoothie.  Later, she shows off chocolate chip cookies and cinnamon rolls while saying its sourdough everything at their house.  Carson Charles (Carles) Paine turns 10 years old the day after Poppa Bill passes away.  Erin says he is perfect like Chad and talks about his faith in Jesus and how he is always with William.  Kid’s been brothermomming for over 5 years now.  On Mother’s Day Erin praises Kelly and Chad’s mom.  Erin is the very first Bates to announce that Bill Bates has passed away.  She gives no details on her vlog, but says she interviewed him a few years back and is going to share that interview. Right off the rip she call herself the favorite granddaughter, and then she does it again and again… and again throughout the video.  Poor Poppa Bill seemed backed into a corner and when Erin admits that she knows he can’t say that she is the favorite… he jokingly says “well I can SAY it…”(he just doesn’t have to mean it).  She calls him brilliant and frugal.  He says in marriage you must be patient, and then the whole thing goes off the rails when he talks about disciplining your children and the right way to spank.  Erin nods along in agreement and says young folks should take his advice.  I mean… she could have cleaned this up a little.  At the time of this interview he had 24 great grandchildren and said he knew many more were on the way.  Erin remembers going to court with him when he was a magistrate.  All in all it seems Bill was a man of few words and he didn’t seem comfortable in front of the camera.  On Instagram, Erin shows the farm and says it’s her favorite place.  We see her kids playing with Tori’s kids, so we know they are there… and have been there.
 

 
 
9.For 2 weeks Lawson has done nothing but promote this song and music video about Poppa Bill Bates.  The song is all about dementia, but many folks take it as a goodbye bc he has died… weeks before he actually does die.  Kelly Joe posts that she is just bawling crying over Lawson’s song.  When they aren’t promoting the song, we are seeing glimpses from their big cruise to Alaska.  Tiffy shows off pictures of her and Callie together sightseeing, and eating pizza.  Callie must have scored an invite as a babysitter for Will on this trip, because JebJud didn’t get to go and are stuck at home with Katie.  It looks like Tiffany’s aunt and uncle are also on the trip, along with her brother.  Being on a cruise doesn’t stop the constant posting of the cringe-worthy reels.  Tiffy posts several including one where she lays her head in Will’s lap to see what he will do.  What he does is slap the snot out of her.  Do it again baby Will!  In another she says Lawson gave her a “little piece of him” so she won’t ever be alone again.  A “little piece”?  You don’t say Tiff.  We see Gil and Kelly Joe on the trip with them and Gil looks exhausted.  Tiffy makes a reel showing clips of herself as a little girl and they all get off of the ship to tour Canada.   On the deck of the ship, Tiffy and Lawson decide to take a picture where she sits on Lawson’s shoulders and baby Will sits on her shoulders. Very dangerous and of course, more of Tiffy appearing to be Lawson’s child.  Tiffany says she was screaming the entire time… well except for when she was grinning for the picture.  It’s the 3rdanniversary of these 2 buffoons and to celebrate, Tiffany promotes Lawson’s sad, sappy song.  After the trip, she says her mom is back in Tennessee with her and she wishes a happy birthday to Carles Paine.  She really picks and chooses who she wishes Happy Birthday.  Tiffany tells us she got to sit first class on the way home, but she didn’t even enjoy it because she couldn’t be with Will and Lawson.  After more than a month, they finally have a new vlog.  It starts with Tiffany being sick and burning up with a fever, but by the next day she is miraculously better.  They are constantly addressing the audience as “guys” and asking stupid questions.  The vlog is mostly the behind the scenes of the music video.  It was filmed after July 4th last year on the farm.  Carlin and Evan are there as cameraman and director and Alyssa is there visiting also.  Back to present time, about a month ago, we see how much Bill has progressed in his illness.  Lawson takes Janie to her treatments and sits on the porch with Bill.  Lawson talks nonstop for more than ten minutes while Bill mostly nods in agreement and says “oh boy”.  Bless his heart.  Tiffany tries to humble brag that baby Will’s picture is the only one of a great grand up on the wall.  She says this while over her shoulder we see a picture of Nathan holding Kenna.  Both Lawson and Tiffany take to Instagram to ask for prayers for a friend who has passed away.  It appears to be their pastor’s wife from a church in San Diego.  Even after Poppa Bill passes away, Tiffany and Lawson continue to share content on social media.  We see baby Will watching the movie Sandlot, laughing and clapping and another reel where Tiff says Lawson pays the mortgage, all of the bills, their health insurance and still goes to fetch her treats. Not sure what she is trying to prove, but he must have a money tree in the backyard that Duke guards for him… In his music video for the poppa Bill song he points to his watch when talking about the time and holds up five fingers for 1995… I never realized my work paid that well.  Tiffany wants everyone to know she is hanging out with Erin and Tori so she tagged them over the picture of a Starbucks drink thanking them for bringing it to her.




10.The Bates Sisters  Boutique is truly grasping at straws these days… They participate in a local small business giveaway to try and drive customers to their website. Before Mother’s Day, they announce that unfortunately they have had trouble getting in their mommy and me dresses. They are only able to get two styles, one pink and one blue… The entire campaign lands with a thud.  People comment that these dresses have been available on the site and they aren’t new… The Boutique comments back, apologizing that it just didn’t work out.  The dresses are $78 each and the kids styles are $45 each. The boutique features a ton of new models and drops and Americana line of clothing… Everything is red white and blue and severely overpriced $85 for a dress and $50 for a sleeveless top.  The girls now running the shop show off the crumble cookies that they say vendors brought to them and later they chopped the prices of everything on the website to almost $10 apiece. They announce another cash and Cari coming at the end of June and you just have to wonder how long can they keep this up?  Meanwhile, Kelly Joe Bates continues trying to become a late in life influencer and momager.  She reposts every Vlog all of her children have shared for the last month and raves over every one of them. She says she’s getting caught up on the plane ride home from her trip. Kelly says the trip was a gift to her and Gil from Lawson and Tiffany, and it was a trip of a lifetime… More of that mystery Lawson Bates money. Kelly says they are heading straight to the farm because Bill has taken a turn for the worst. She thanks Ellie for posting about her on Mother’s Day and says she does not deserve Ellie‘s love and apologizes for all the mistakes they made while parenting. Interesting, right? Is she apologizing for raising her children in a cult?? All of the kids who publicly said happy Mother’s Day to Kelly get a public thank you from Kelly.  She posts a long post about her own mother and talks about how she and momma Jane have become best friends in the past year… says there’s nowhere she would rather be than on the farm spending time with Bill and Jane (no mention of Gil!!). She wishes a happy anniversary to Lawson and Tiffany and happy birthday to Carles Paine.  Kelly calls Lawson and Tiffany a sweet little couple and says that Tiffany is a wonderful little Wife. There’s that word again… Esther pops up on social media to thank Nathan for the steak dinner. He cooked for Mother’s Day and she lets us know that happy Allen is now crawling.



It was a lot of absolutely nothing to get caught up on friends! Have an amazing week!

1kpvgeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kpvgeo/how_soon_to_tell_a_woman_im_interested_in/,How soon to tell a woman I'm interested in?,"A bit of context: We (25M and 31F) have known each other for over two years through studies and working in related creative fields, but we live several countries away at the moment. Over the past several months, we've gotten a lot closer, text in her language (which I can kind of speak) about every other day about anything you can imagine, had a 1.5-hour-long video call recently with mutual plans for a second one, and have been flirting on and off for several weeks—for example, she sent me a winking emoji when she gave me her number, we often end up talking about things that feel romantic in the world, and she has responded playfully to my occasional indirect compliments about her appearance.

Today when she told me more about a photoshoot she was posing for, I all but directly told her she was gorgeous and she love reacted the message (it was on a messaging app where double-tapping doesn't automatically send a love react.) She's also told me directly that she's single and only looking for something serious, just like I am, and given our level of interaction and openness, I'm quite sure she's not seeing anybody right now.

Things are moving toward telling her soon, and I could of course tell her the next time we can call or at least bring up the subject. On the other hand, I'm in a much better place both physically and mentally compared to when we would occasionally meet for coffee as friends, and I want to show that in person; I'd most likely be able to visit her country around two months from now.

A woman's perspective would be especially appreciated—if there's mutual interest, would you prefer a guy to tell you earlier in this situation or wait until you can see him in person?",1,1747605004.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what’s called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

**Part 53: The Quest for the Holy Grail**

.

.



The Seeker and the Stranger ride on a white steed through a barren landscape. Lands of Savannah, desolate and empty. The Horse follows the trail of Dried up riverbeds. The sun burns on their skins.



“What exactly are we after?” asks the Seeker the Stranger, while wiping the sweat from their forehead.



“The Holy Grail,” responds the grinning Stranger.



“It's a symbol used in many stories, representing the unification of opposites. The Union of the Divine Male and Divine Feminine Aspects of Consciousness. It's a Merging of Order and Chaos, of Intelligence and Love, of rationality and creativity. By balancing out both Aspects of the Self. By Synchronizing both hemispheres of the brain. By ending all Dualities within, creating Peace between Logic and Love. A state of inner equilibrium, reenacting the Stillness prior to the Big Bang.”



The Seeker scratches their head. “Wait... I always thought, that this Grail was like some ancient artifact... Like some treasure that makes me rich...”



“It does make you rich. Rich in Spirit. The Collective Human Unconscious speaks to the individual through stories. Through Symbols and Motifs. If you know how to decode them, you will find that all human fiction carries hidden, spiritual meaning. Because our Myths and Legends, the ancient and the modern ones, don't just speak to the Human Mind, they also speak to the Human Soul.



When the Knight Galahad hunted after the Grail, he united the external Quest, represented by Yang with the inner Stillness of Ying. When Perceval set out to find the Grail, he first had to learn a lesson in compassion, uniting his masculine and feminine aspects of Self. The Quest for the Holy Grail is a Journey towards Wholeness. That's why it's called 'Holy' Grail. You see, the origin of the word 'Holy' is 'Whole'.



Regardless of Sex and Gender, each Person possess both Masculine and Feminine aspects. However Society has conditioned Man to repress the Anima and Woman to repress the Animus. This causes imbalance, suppression, depression, addiction. A man, who has not integrated his female aspects relies too much on his rationality, dismissing his emotions. A woman, who has not integrated her male aspects, relies too much on her emotions and too little on her rational mind.



To be whole, one needs to embody both aspects of Self, the Male and the Female. One needs to harmonize the energies of Giving and Receiving, of pouring out and taking in. Balancing both aspects releases a tremendous amount of energy, which would otherwise be spent on a never-ending inner conflict. One, who has harmonized and unified both aspects of Self is like a clear channel for higher Divine inspiration to be expressed in the physical world. This is the Holy Grail of Spirituality. It's completion. Unity with the Divine.”

.

.

“How do I get there?” asks the Seeker. “What do I need to do to reach completion? Where do I find this 'Holy Grail'?”

.

.



The Strangers eyebrows pull together.

“Throughout the Centuries, many Seekers set out to find the Holy Grail, only to return empty handed. Many have tried, many have failed. Some have searched all their Life without ever finding. Asking the wrong questions, seeking in the wrong places. One Lifetime alone, may not be enough. Hundreds of Lifetimes, may not be enough. Even if you accept this Quest for the Holy Grail, there is no guarantee, that you will ever find it. The Grail will first test you, before it reveals itself to you. You will need to face many difficult challenges and prove yourself to be worthy. Are you committed to follow a trail of Breadcrumbs, leading you from one hint to the next? Solving Riddles, uncovering Mysteries and decoding ancient Secrets? Are you willing to pay the price for wholeness, even if it costs you everything?”



The Seeker sighs. “Creating that Red Stone already dragged on for way too long and now you expect me to pay my attention to the next 'Mythical Object Quest'? Can't we like just skip this part and move on to the Main Quest?”



“If you bypass the inner work, the same lesson will come up again, until it's learned. The Quest is there. You can avoid it or you can embrace it. How you approach the Quest is up to you. You can ignore it, you can run away from it. But even if you have completed all other Missions, this Quest will still be there. Waiting for you to be resolved. And the longer you wait to answer the Call, the Quest will become more difficult.”



The Seeker takes a deep breath. “Alright... Fine... I'll accept the Quest... Let's find that damned Grail.”

.



Up ahead, the Stranger spots a Human, sitting on an elevated platform. The Stranger pulls the reins, the white horse stops. Next to the dried up riverbed, there is a crumbling, wooden footbridge. On the pier sits an old man with a crown in royal garments. He holds a fishing rod, which dangles above the cracked, hardened mud. With a melancholic face, he puffs on a cigarette and sighs.



“Welcome fair friends. Come rest here, at my side. In the wasteland, where the rivers of Life have all dried up. Where the Grass has turned to dust. In this barren landscape, where the times of joy are long forgotten. Here in the desolate Solitude of the my forgotten Kingdom.”

.

.



The Strangers climb down from the Horse. The Seeker follows hesitantly. They stare at the Fisher on the Pier.



“You are aware, that you are fishing in Dust?” asks the Seeker skeptically.



The old man sighs. “You know... Even after my wound was healed, it wouldn't stop my aging. Nothing can stop the passage of time. Even when we cling to our memories, when we fish in dried up riverbeds. Not even the Grail in my hands could stop it. When I was dying, the Land was dying with me. But now the Land dies and I die along with it.”



“Wait!” interrupts the Seeker. “ You have the Grail? We are searching for this exact thing.”



The Fisher King takes out a Golden Chalice from a bag.



“What was that Gentleman's Name again?,” reminisces the Fisher King. 

“I think he was called Perry or something. A Polite fellow, I wonder what happened to him. He left the chalice to me. Everyday I drank with the chalice from the river of Life. But then the Water stopped to flow and once again the land turned desolate. The Rivers all dried up. The animals left the country. The Trees, the Grass, the Flowers all died off. The Rivers dried up, the Fish all died. Dead Birds fell from up above. Even the vultures avoid my Desolate wasteland. All Life abandoned my Kingdom. Now I am the last one left.”





The Fisher King Throws the Holy Grail into the Seeker's Hands. “Here take the Grail. I don't need it. It never served ME anyway. Even when I became the Grail King.”



The Seeker examines the Cup in their hands. “What?”

.



“That ummm... That was surprisingly easy... Didn't you tell me something about this being a tough quest.”



“I am just as surprised as you,” gasps the Stranger. “I guess... If you already know that the Grail is within you, it saves you a lot of time.”



.

.



The old Fisher King points at the Chalice. 

“The Grail only unfolds it's true potential after you know the True Answer to the Grail Question. The Question is: Whom does the Grail serve? I always thought the Answer was, that is servers the Grail King. But I was wrong. It didn't serve me. I never found the True Answer. No matter what I did, The Grail would never fully bend to my Will.”

  
.



The Stranger looks around at the desolate landscape. “Say Fisher King, why exactly did the River of Life dry up?”



“I don't know,” sighs the Fisher King. “Many adventurers were seeking the Source of the River of Life, but no one has ever returned. I am the Guardian of this dying Land. I can't leave my Kingdom. Could you perhaps go and have a look for me?”



The Seeker hesitates for a moment.

“If I do accept the Quest, what will be my reward?” asks the Seeker.





“Why does everything need a reward? Can't you just do it for the sake of doing something good?” sighs the Fisher King.



“Anyway... If you take the Chalice to the holy tree and fill it with water directly from Source, it will give you a direct connection to Divine Inspiration. Channeled from the pool of infinity. It's from where Artists draw inspiration, it's from where Humans draw ideas. It's an Intelligence, present in all of us. An Intelligence that recognizes itself. And it's Love. Compassion for all beings. The interconnectedness within all things. I will now return to my Castle. If you make it back, you can visit me in Corbenic. Please bring me some of the water directly from the fountain.”



The Fisher King looks at the Seeker with trusting eyes.



“I... I will try my best...”

.

.



The Seeker and the Stranger climb back on the Horse and wink goodbye to the Fisher King.



“Let us follow the dried up Stream,” suggests the Stranger. The Seeker nods.





Along the dead river, there is crumbling architecture, abandoned long ago. Ruins of Ancient Kingdoms, forgotten in time. Broken Statues and fallen Pillars. Palaces buried beneath Dust and Sand.



After some time of silently riding through deserted lands, following a never-ending, dried-up river bed, the Seeker examines the Holy Grail in their hand. The Seekers tongue touches their dry lips.



“How does this Grail work anyway? I am starting to get thirsty... I thought it was some overpowered magical item. Does it like fulfill wishes or something? I could really need a cold drink.”



“You need the correct Answer to the Grail Question,” responds the Stranger.



“Speak the right words to activate the Grail. The Chalice then instantly manifests Water from the infinite Source of Life into your Vessel.”



The Seeker takes a moment to think about the Grail question.

“Whom does the Grail Serve? It serves ME. Me, who holds the cup.”



Around 10 ML of Water manifest out of nowhere in the Seeker's cup. “What? Only this Little?!”



The Seeker sighs and gulps down the Liquid in one fell swoop. A warm sensation spreads through the Seekers body. Everything shakes and vibrates. Shivers from head to toe. The Seeker's face turns into a relaxed smile. An expression of Tranquility and contentment. Pure Bliss. The Seeker looks around with complete clarity in their gaze. The mesmerized Seeker stares in awe at the beauty of the world around them. After twelve infinity breaths, this state of being fades away and the Seeker returns to normalcy.



https://preview.redd.it/wsoelgzinl1f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c13a2f1e6eaf053e2033a5258ec44309b81a9a32

“More! I need more of this water! Whom does the Grail Serve? ME! It serves me! Clench my Thirst, Grail!”



Nothing happens. The Cup refuses to pour out holy water.



“Why doesn't it work? Does this ability have a cooldown time?”





“Until you have found the right answer to the Grail Question, the cup only gives you a fraction of what it can give,” explains the Stranger.

  
.

.



Along the way, there is an empty canvas and painting tools. Someone unconscious lies in the dried up river bed. The Stranger pulls the reins. The white steed stops. After closer inspection, the Seeker recognizes the person in need to be a Bird-of-Paradise. He looks malnourished.



https://preview.redd.it/mrc7jtplql1f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=066385a4c48e7a65a5e8b84e85a561e6f3e8478c

“Are you okay?” asks the Seeker the half-dead Bird.



The colorful Bird mumbles something very quiet. He has a slow breath and a weak voice.



“Could you please repeat that again?” asks the Seeker and holds their ear to the Birds Beak.



“Inspiration,” utters the Bird woefully. “I need Inspiration. Please... I am a starving artist who is in dire need of inspiration.”



“Inspiration?” asks the Seeker confused.



“Yes...” responds the Bird-of-Paradise and coughs up blood. “No matter how much I follow the trends, my artwork always falls short... Inspiration is an artist's greatest asset. I may be the most skilled painter, but without proper inspiration, my Art will always be inadequate. I therefore came here to drink from the River of Life... I was hoping to find new inspiration. But the Water it's all gone... Woe is me, for I have become an artists greatest Nightmare. I have become Unoriginal.”



The Seeker takes out the Holy Grail. “Perhaps I can help you... Whom does the Grail serve? The Grail serves the starving artist.”



The Cup fills up 150 ML of water. The Seeker holds it at the Birds Beak.

“But please don't drink all of it. Leave some of the Water to...”



The Bird of Paradise slurps down the entire Liquid in one fell swoop.



“...Me,” sighs the Seeker.



The Bird licks his lips and burps. His face changes almost instantly. From tired, broken and hopeless to a bright, joyful and awake expression. His malnourished body is filled with Life. He takes his tools and starts painting on his canvas.



“That's it!” exclaims the Bird-of-Paradise excited. “Oh, how the Neurons explode in my brain. I have seen it in a vision behind closed eyes. The perfect image for my next painting. Something completely original. Unlike anything ever seen before. I will now create a masterpiece!”



https://preview.redd.it/r3ln4lzwql1f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bede2644eb9b4866c556729ccc37a5230bd9c9d6

The Bird is fully absorbed by his canvas, no longer paying any attention to the Seeker.



“You are welcome,” mumbles the Seeker and climbs on the Horseback. The Journey continues.







“So what exactly is this river of Life, you are constantly talking about?” asks the Seeker the Stranger, as they follow the track of the dried up river to its beginning.



“In Hinduism, there is the concept of Prana,” begins the Mysterious Stranger. 



“In Chinese traditional Medicine, they speak of Qi. In Kabbalah it's the Divine energy flowing from the infinite Ein Sof. In Alchemy they call it the 'Aqua Vitae', the water of Life. It's the vital Life-Force, that flows through all things like a river. If the Grail in your hands is a metaphorical representation of the energetic flow through your individualized system of being, then the river is synonymous with the universal Cosmic Flow of Life Force. The Grail relates to the Microcosm, the River of Life relates to the Macrocosm.”





“This sounds like some made-up nonsense. Can you back up your claim with science? Is there any empirical evidence that proves this 'energies' existence? Are there any successful experiments, that would measure this 'energy'? Or is your source just 'Trust me Bro'?”





The Stranger smirks. “Look, I am not here to convince you of anything. Neither am I trying to prove the validity of secret Knowledge to a world, that is not yet ready for it. All I can do is share what I know and it's up to you whether you find it worth pursuing or not. In the end, you need to experience it for yourself. You need to feel it in your body. The Energy. Tingling, vibrating, oscillating. The heat, the warmth. The wind when you absorb it. The pressure when you radiate it outwards. The spiritual chills and shivers flowing through your spine.



When you have advanced far enough on your own Spiritual Journey, you will come across practices, that focus on leveling up energetically. The more you sharpen your sensitivity to the energies around you, the more you become aware of them. At some point you may feel the Energy physically or, if your pineal gland is activated, you may even see the energy centers visually oscillating in the air.”





https://preview.redd.it/mnkla9fjrl1f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ab0fafc64a3ab438a68100f0184d511e3d35ba3

The white Horse suddenly stops. Again something blocks the path ahead. A Dolphin lies on the cracked, hardened mud-floor. She wears glasses. Her fins hold her head. There is a chalkboard, displaying complicated mathematics.



“It just doesn't make any sense,” mumbles the stressed out Dolphin. 

“No matter, how many times I go through this equation... I just can't understand it... It defies all Logic! It's giving me a headache!”



“Is there anything we can do for you?” asks the Seeker with concerned eyes.



""Yes, actually—if you could momentarily suspend the laws of mathematics, or perhaps convince this equation to solve itself out of pity, that’d be splendid. Otherwise, maybe just stand there and radiate confusion—it’s clearly working for you.""



https://preview.redd.it/9veimtvesl1f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=95c6f791ce8cb55e227afa8e84639e83765982f2

The Seeker is speechless. They try to think of a good comeback but nothing comes to mind. The offended Seeker climbs back up on the Horse.



“Let's not waste any more time, Stranger. She clearly doesn't want our help...”



“The Future of our World depends on this Equation!” cries out the Dolphin. “If I could just understand this, it would solve so many Problems. All I need is some clarity!”



The Seeker sighs and gets back down from the Horse. “Whom does the Grail serve? It serves the Scientist.”



The Cup fills up around 100 ML. The Seeker offers the Chalice with Holy water to the Dolphin. “Here drink. This Water will give you some clarity.”



The Dolphin looks at the Cup with skepticism. She smells the Liquid. “What is this? Is it Coffee?”



“No, it's actually water from the--”



Before the Seeker finishes their sentence, the Dolphin has already emptied the Cup.



“--River of Life...”



The Dolphin has her eyes wide open. She wipes the board clean with a Sponge and starts to scribble new equations. “Why didn't I think about this sooner?! Of course! Now it all makes sense. After isolating celestial mechanics, cross-referencing orbital vectors, and—frankly—surpassing the intellectual limits of my contemporaries, I have arrived at a startling conclusion: the Earth... revolves around the Sun.”



The Seeker and the Stranger continue their journey, leaving the Dolphin-Scientist and her Chalkboard behind.



https://preview.redd.it/gund15ensl1f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8525ef55f5497f2d24a163385cee531b695d9bee



The scorching sun burns on the skin of the Seeker. Sweat drips from their forehead.

“I am getting real thirsty again... I wonder, if the Grail blesses me with water. Whom does the Grail serve? It serves ME.”



The Cup manifest Seven droplets of Holy Water. The disappointed Seeker sighs, takes the Grail and shakes it above their mouth. The single drops fall on the Seeker's dry tongue.



“The Fisher King was right... This Cup is useless!”







After several hours of riding, a large mountain with a flat top appears on the horizon. It's at the end of the dead River. A Gigantic mesa, as big as a small country. Almost 1,7 Kilometers High. The wide Cliff stretches over the entire horizon. The top of the elevated plateau is green, covered with grass and vegetation.



https://preview.redd.it/63ibtgogtl1f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9cc0659056453c036782d226a3566b86b621332f

The Path ahead connects with three other dried-up canals into a pool. At the intersection of the four rivers stands a Gorilla below a streetlamp.



“Hey you,” shouts the Gorilla at the Strangers. The Horse stops.

“Do you have an idea for an app?”



“Umm... What?” asks the Seeker confused.





“All I need is just one clever business idea. Something about fitness. Something about sports. Something about Banana-Milkshakes. Something that gets me chicks. One good idea to make me rich. One good idea to prove to the world that I am more than just a simple Gorilla.”





The Seeker sighs. “Alright... I see... The next one, who wants to sip from my cup. Let's see how much water the Grail blesses you with. Whom does the Grail serve? The Grail serves the common people.”



The Chalice manifests 500 ml of Holy Water.



The Seeker clenches their teeth. 'What?! That dumb Gorilla get's this much?! This is unfair... I don't think it will make a big difference, if I take a small drip before giving it to the Gorilla.'



Just as the Seeker's lips are about to touch the Grail, the Gorilla pulls it out from their hands.

“Hey can I have a taste?”



The Gorilla gulps down 2/3 of the contents, wipes his mouth and returns the Cup with the remaining holy water.

“Thank you. I hope you don't mind. I am a Germaphobe.”



The eyes of the Gorilla lighten up. For a moment he is in awe. The Light Bulb of the streetlamp above suddenly turns on.



“I have the best idea ever. I will make a podcast and talk about stuff like psychedelics, spirituality and mysteries like Atlantis 'n stuff.”



https://preview.redd.it/xpudkme9ul1f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4a33af6c1a67c79b38f074e1121f48e38790951



The Seeker drinks the rest of the water, but spits it right out again. “Eww... This tastes awful. What happened to the holy water?”



“It wasn't meant for you,” responds the Stranger. “It spoils if you try to take it from another. Unless it's shared in Love, it will always leave a bitter taste. Just like Energy. Just like Attention. Only share in Love. Not in shallow politeness, not in regret, not in reluctance, not in expectation of any return.”



The Stranger points at the Great Mesa and asks the Gorilla: “Is this where the Tree of Life is hidden?”



“I don't know,” shrugs the Gorilla. “But the river of Life used to flow from up there all the way down. There was a great waterfall. But then the water stopped flowing and the land below turned dry.”



“How do we get up there?” asks the Stranger.



“There is a stair case etched into the stone. Right behind the waterfall. It's the 'Ten Thousand steps to Paradise'. I heard getting up there used to be impossible, when the water was still flowing. Now It's still difficult, but do-able.”





The Seeker and the Stranger pass the gorilla and walk through the dried lake basin. They stop at ancient steps, etched into the rock of the massive sandstone wall. The staircase is a masterwork of masonry.



“Don't you think it's unfair?” asks the Seeker, who struggles to keep up with the Strangers pace on the stairs. “I mean, I shared so much with Strangers and yet when I ask for some holy water, all I get are droplets. Why does the Grail only bless me with so little?”



“You still believe that the Grail serves an individual Person,” points out the Stranger, hopping effortlessly from one step to the next.

“It's your answer to the Grail Question that limits it's output. You need to find an answer, that breaks the limit. Manifest the Holy Water not with a fractured intent, but from a place of wholeness. Because if you share from a state of fragmentation, what you give will also be just as limited. You are not a person, sharing their energy with another person. You are the ONE, sharing Energy of the ONE with the ONE.”





After around three hours of walking upstairs, the Seeker and the Stranger finally arrive at the top of the platform.

.

**NEW LOCATION DISCOVERED**

The exhausted Seeker breathes heavily and looks around. Lush fields of Grass and flowers. Flat land, many Kilometers wide. There are many small Trees spread out over the entire platform. Over the edge, a wall of dense, white clouds covers the land below.



In the corner of their eye, the Seeker spots something that looks like a large, green Hose, shining in the sun. It's as tall as a Tree. Neither the beginning, nor end of the structure are visible from where the Seeker stands.



The Stranger investigates the object. “Now I know what blocks the Flow of the River of Life.”



From up close, the Seeker sees that the Hose has scales. It breathes. They follow the direction of the Monsters head. After around Six-Hundred Meters of walking they arrive at a single, giant tree in a field of Grass and Flowers. The Tree has golden leafs and violet apples hanging from it. There are many puddles of clear water in the ground.



A never-ending source of the water of Life gushes out from a hole out the bark of the Tree. Like an eternal fountain. The Water fizzes out and lands directly in the open mouth of a giant Serpent, who drinks all the water. The Snake is around Six Meters High.



“What are you doing here?!” shouts the Stranger with a serious voice. His eyes are burning. He unsheathes his swords.



“You don't belong here! This water is not yours alone. It's to be shared with everyone. Your greed destroys the Kingdom. Don't you care about the people you hurt with your selfish actions?”



The Giant Serpent laughs. “Care? You think I care about anyone other than myself? No, this water is mine and mine alone. The only thing I care about is how to clench my endless thirst for more. More pleasure, more power, more possessions. I want everything and I won't stop until everything is mine.”





“I can't allow this to happen. Your selfishness obstructs the flow of the River of Life. People feel depressed, hopeless, sad and tired, because they are disconnected from their source. Your Greed blocks the channel of higher inspiration. It causes a lack of originality, a loss of creativity, a disconnect from spirit.”



The Seeker frowns after listening. “Wait... Are you telling me that he is the reason, why there are no new ideas? Is this why modern art and entertainment lacks meaning? Why all new movies are just hollow reboots? You Monster!”





“What are you gonna do about it?” laughs the twisted tongue mischievously. “You want to drink from Source? Only over my dead body! I am the biggest and strongest creature in this Garden. All who challenged me in the past have perished. You have no chance.”

  


https://preview.redd.it/gn1psmcnxl1f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb60e6264b040e4703f77b3b61c6eb95ba28aed5

The Seeker clenches their fist. “Are you the Reason why the 'Rings of Power' turned out to be such a disappointment? If you really are responsible, then it's now personal!”



The Stranger pulls back the Seeker and takes a step forward, standing protectively in front of them. “You are not ready to face such a challenge just yet. On the level down there perhaps. But up here, the challenge is mine. I need to fight the Serpent myself. Just as I respect your right to grow from your own challenges, I ask you to respect mine and not interfere in this battle.”



The Seeker nods. The Stranger takes a fighting stance. “This is your last chance! Go away, Now! Leave this place now peacefully or I will throw you out with force!”



The Giant Serpent laughs. “How cute... You really think you can---”



Suddenly the Serpent is taken by surprise, as the Stranger pulls down his hood and reveals his face. The Serpent hisses both out of fear and anger. Within the fracture of a Second, the Snake goes for a bite with his sharp fangs. But the Stranger blocks the teeth of the Beast with his swords.



“Well,” hisses the twisted tongue with a smirk. “Looks like you don't belong here either.”



The Serpent spews out a beam of water. The color of the water is tainted black. The Stranger dodges just in time.



“I know who you are,” shouts the Stranger. “I know what you represent. I see you, even when you hide yourself in a false light. Your reign ends now, your time is over.”



The Words of the Stranger burns in the air like fire. His Sword of Truth glows Blue. The left Sword glows red. He swings his swords against the Monster's neck. The Great Beast dodges.



“If you think Humanity stands any chance, you are deluding yourself. Humanity is far too lost. It's too late to change. There is no way.”



The Serpent attacks again with his fangs, the Stranger dodges, swings his swords and cuts the Monster's neck.

“There always is a way,” shouts the Stranger with burning eyes. His words ignite fire in the air.



The Serpent bleeds, his blood his black. “Nothing is permanent. Every house you build will fall apart. Everyone you know will die. Every Memory you cling to, will one day be forgotten. Everything you do is meaningless.”



“No,” grins the Stranger and swings his blue sword against the Monster's neck. “The world might be meaningless, but that's why I am here to create meaning.”



With a clean hit, the Stranger chops off the Serpents heavy head. The Beast is slain. The blocked Source is cleared. The Water of Life flows anew.



As the floodgates open, new water flows out of the Tree of Life all the way back to the edge of the mountain. Down at the bottom, the Gorilla stares in astonishment as the waterfall is fueled by a new wave of water. 



https://preview.redd.it/h2o55rnbyl1f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fcd3fc5c5f74934dd080e191ba544d611e87ca7

The water flows through the country. Wherever the wave of water flows, Life returns in the surrounding area. New grass, trees and flowers grow instantly wherever the water returns. The Dolphin welcomes the new wave and surfs on her chalkboard. The Bird-of-Paradise takes his completed artwork and views the river from above. In Corbenic, the hidden castle, the Fisher King get's up from his Throne to witness the return of the water of Life from his balcony.



Back at the mountain summit, the Seeker stares at the Tree from which an infinite source of holy water flows. The Seeker is captivated by the archetypal sight. It stirs something deep within the Seeker. The clouds at the edge of the Mesa create an eerie atmosphere.



“This reminds me of a vague dream... The Tree, the fountain of water... It all feels so familiar... Have I been here before?”



“Few people ever been here,” responds the Stranger. “I think Plato visited this place in a dream once. Then there was this one Celtic Druid who traveled here through the Astral Realm. A few Kabbalists, Sufis and Mystics also had visions of this place. Although it's not really a place. It's a unconscious representation of something primal, something ancient, something sacred. A memory deep ingrained in our collective consciousness. This is the Point where our world is projected like a hologram from Infinity. This is from where Reality is streamed.



Fill your Chalice with water directly from Source. Pure, unfiltered essence directly from the infinite Source of Life. Then ask the Grail Question directly to the Cup itself and drink its holy water. It will then reveal to you the true Answer to the great Question through visions and images.”





The Seeker approaches the Tree of Life and holds their cup in the source of the water of Life. When the Grail is full, the Seeker holds it up high above their head and asks:

“Whom does the Grail serve?”





The Seeker drinks from the Crystal clear water. The Seeker feels an overflow of Universal Love, a connection to the Source of Being. The Quietness of the Lucid Moment. A Moment in time between moments. When there is only Presence.



The Seeker feels a connection to all, that is. Awareness extends over all surroundings. Awareness of the Birds, of the Trees, of the Sky. And the Seeker recognizes themselves in all observations. The Seekers awareness extends over to all animals, to all beings on the world. It's as if the Seeker feels an influx of Memories and experiences. For one moment, the Seeker stares directly into the heart of infinity. The Unlimited from which the limited is projected. The Still-point of Infinity from where the Holy Water is spawned. And the Seeker is one with everything.



“Now I know the answer to the Grail question,” speaks the Seeker with burning eyes.



https://preview.redd.it/qptdcnbfyl1f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e3707acc8b2ecd57c53483eca8c17185d904fb6

Suddenly a loud sounds grabs the Seeker's and the Strangers attention. Out of the Serpent's cut off neck, two new heads grow. A deadly wound, healed. “You really thought this would be enough to end me? No, it only made me stronger.”



From both heads the Serpent spews out Black, oily liquid. Corrupted water from the source. The Stranger dodges the first beam and pushes away the Seeker.



The Stranger takes a deep breath in, then he holds it and pushes out the breath. He exhales a burning orb through his mouth and lets it flow back through his nose, as it circles vertically like an infinity pattern in and out. After the Twelfth Breath, he takes in a last deep Breath, lets the energy flow down into his root Chakra, holds it and pulls it back up.



A new flame ignites in the Strangers eye. His Aura becomes visible like a flame around his body. A flame that gets stronger and stronger. The aura takes on a new form. The Form of a Mythical Beast. A Sphinx, a cherub, a winged Lion. Standing upright like a swordsman. Equipped with armor and with two swords mirroring the Stranger. The etheric form is a visible layer of blue, red and yellow energy patterns.



With his new form, the Stranger faces the giant two-headed Serpent. The wall of energy around the Stranger shields him from damage. The Sphinx strikes the Serpent with his sword. An epic battle ensues. The Serpent bites, chokes or shoots out Corrupted waters with two heads. The Stranger dodges the attacks when he is attentive and gets hit when he is distracted. The Stranger adapts. Learning from each hit. He maintains his attention even longer.



https://preview.redd.it/m17u6xwr0m1f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7efed0afd3421091cd554d9ff534c486e0e37892

The Stranger enters flowstate. Every attack is countered with a swordstrike. Using the environment to his advantage. The Stranger pushes the Serpent ever closer to the edge of the Mesa, as he overwhelms the Beast, with his streak of fast sword strikes.



Driven into a corner, the Two-headed Serpent attacks the Stranger's Spirit Armor. The Stranger ignites both Swords, in red and blue flames. With one strong cut, he severs off both heads and the Serpent over the edge.



“You will regret this! I will Destroy you! Hear me?! I will make you pay.”





“You are banned from this place,” speaks the Stranger and watches over the serpents downfall.



As soon as the presence of the Snake is gone, the place lights up. A looming shadow that once threw shade on paradise is now banished. The River of Life flows again. Holy water streams down the waterfalls and splits in the valley below into Four Rivers.



“How do we get back down there?” asks the Seeker the Stranger.



“Easy,” grins the Stranger. “All we need is a boat that never sinks.”



The Stranger reveals a wooden boat behind a bush. The Seeker wonders where it suddenly came from. Together with the Seeker, they drag the boat into the water stream and enter it.

“You really sure this Boat will survive the waterfall?” questions the Seeker nervously.



“Be Love and no matter where you are on the river of Life, you will always flow in the right direction. Be Love when we fall over the cliff. Be Love when the boat hits the lakes surface. Be Love all the way through the process. Even during the scary moments.”



The Boat tips over the edge. Falling down 1.7 Kilometers. As they fall, the Seeker screams in fear of Death. The Stranger however laughs manically like a madman.



https://preview.redd.it/nt5at5gn1m1f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=589dbb96859846532b8ba08bb606865eddced9aa

“Remember Seeker,” shouts the Stranger in the falling boat. “Be Love. Even Now!”



The Seeker takes in a deep breath and with burning eyes, the Seeker speaks: “Love is, when Fear is not!”



Suddenly, just before the boat hits the Lake, it stops mid-air, levitates for a moment above the water surface and then drops into the stream with little impact.



“What the hell did just happen?” asks the Seeker confused. “How are we still alive?”



“Didn't you know?” grins the Stranger. “This is a magical Boat.”







The Boat floats down the river stream. Wherever it flows, there is new nature blossoming. Trees with new life, Grass, Flowers, Insects, Birds, Animals. There is even fish in the water. Life has returned to a Land that was starving.



Along the River they see the Gorilla, the Dolphin and the Bird-of-Paradise. The Gorilla is now a famous Podcaster, the Scientist receives an award and the artist has his first exhibition.



The Boat floats for sometime along the river, until there appears a castle on the horizon. The Seeker and the Stranger tie the boat to a pier and enter into the castle.

**NEW LOCATION DISCOVERED:**

**Corbenic**

The Seeker walks with the Chalice in his hand to the Throne of the Fisher King.



“Have you found the True Answer to the Grail Question?” asks the elderly King.



“Yes,” affirms the Seeker with determination.



The King smirks. “Then whom does the Grail serve?”





“The Grail serves ALL,” responds the Seeker with a powerful voice. The Fire in their eyes glow up for a moment.





Holy water suddenly bubbles up in the cup out of nowhere and overflows the Grail. An infinite source of Water. Just like the Source of the River of Life, it won't stop flowing.



https://preview.redd.it/hmem7sln2m1f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0478d44414bbc3a65d8124d807f0d8e3d9ba8477

“You can have your Grail back,” speaks the Seeker and hands the overflowing Chalice to the King. 

“When I drank directly from Source, I felt how we are all connected. For a moment I saw through the eyes of All at once. All those Seekers out there. I looked into their heart and I realized, that they are all worth it. Even if they don't realize it about themselves. Every single one is worthy to drink from this water of Life. And it's only our own perceived unworthiness, that cuts us off from this eternal Stream of Life, that we desire so badly without even knowing it. I want this Grail to serve as many people as it can. I think it's better kept in your hands. So take it, as a King you...”



“Don't worry, you can keep it... I still have like a dozen Holy Grails left... Consider it a promotional gift. The Next one will cost you though. They are available in Five different colors.”



The Fisher King points at a corner where several Chalices are displayed on a cabinet. There are golden cups, silver cups, red cups, blue cups and black cups. Each Grail-version is shaped differently.

  
.



**Mission Accomplished:**

**The Source of the River of Life**



.



The Seeker and the Stranger leave the Castle and get back up on their white horse. They continue their journey through a land, where Life blossoms up anew. Where the rivers of Life flow again through once barren landscapes.



“If you want to learn a technique that helps you to perpetuate the flow of higher energy, you should look into the Infinity Breath technique,” speaks the Stranger, as he rides the horse through the .



“The Yogis have been using this technique to synchronize themselves with the flow of Divine Energy since ancient times. Through the Infinity Breath the River of Life flows through you. Unite the Microcosm and the Macrocosm within you, through your breath and tap into the vast storehouse of infinite energy. Master the infinity Breath and synchronize your energetic body to the flow of the River of Life.”



The Seeker has a question but suddenly something else catches their attention. A hot air balloon suddenly crashes right in front of their horse. The Shrinking bag covers four figures, who struggle against the deflated balloon.



Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan emerge from below the deflated balloon. It's the **NEW-AGE-AWAKENED-RESISTANCE-TURTLES.**



D'Artagnan grabs the Seeker's shoulder. “Seeker! It's time to wake up! You are trapped in a simulation!”

We hit it off, talked for hours.during all of these, she found excuses to make physical contact and of course i would do the same.

Asked for her instagram, went for a coffee date the morning after (more like some hours later)
We talked about the last years of our life until now, childhood, family, music, hobbies, almost everything you usually ask for at a first date. Even if she met me before catching a plane, she dolled herself up, and made time for me. She kept searching for physical contact. Didnt start anything because i knew she had a flight to catch, i kissed her on the cheek and i said ill  text her. She told me she was glad to have met me at the party

I come back home unfortunately because of Uni exams. I tried to continue keeping this spark alive on Instagram, but she would always answer basically one day later or more. She is an actress, while i have a normal job, so i thought she was busy or didnt want to entertain me if she doesnt know if ill ever be in the same country as her

The country i met her is one i frequently fly to(like 3/4 times a year, to see my best friend).
I texted her that i was coming back. She asked why, and said that seeing her was of the reasons(as i said i have friends there)
 Before coming back there i asked her out to meet eachother again. She told me yes, and planned a dinner date.

Today, just to check in, i wrote her saying i cant wait to see her again on our date.

She then, out of the blue, wrote : is it a date date?

I said yeah, and she reacted with a surprised emoji. She didnt say anything else.

Before this i was really confident( as much as you can be when you go out with a crush), but now i dont have any, im terryfied she thought i was a friend?

My kitty is ~15/16 years old, ~7lbs, and she’s got stage two kidney disease, we’ve known since october of 2023 and have been treating her with 100ml of sub-q fluids at the vet weekly. Last week we were unable to take her due to some family emergencies. We’ve done this before and she always does just fine, I give her extra wet food (hot water and churu) to make up for some of the loss. 

I gave her the usual 7mg of liquid gabapentin and we went to the vet, and she did just fine with her fluids. We stopped at a coffee shop and she ate about a shot glass’ worth of whipped cream, then her wet food mixed with her Epakitin and she took a nap. 

She normally sleeps pretty hard after the vet, so I didn’t check on her for a few hours. When I did, she had urinated in her spot on my bed and was still sleeping in it. No biggie, I got everything cleaned up and gave her some extra love. She’s doing just fine today, but I’m still worried about her peeing herself. She’s never done this before, her litter box was perfectly clean so she wasn’t doing a protest. 

I assume that she was just sleeping real good and didn’t realize she had to go, but I wasn’t sure if this was something I should bring up to her vet team.

My partner and I went to a fast food restaurant and were waiting for our order when I noticed that the person packing the food into bags had the worst dandruff I have ever seen in my entire life. I'm not talking a few little flakes on her shoulders- ENTIRE front and back of her uniform were covered in a thick layer of skin flakes with the highest concentration around her neck and shoulders. Large flakes were clearly visible clinging onto wisps her hair just waiting to drop. It was one of the most disgusting things I'd ever seen and instantly turned my stomach. My partner noticed too and just shot me a wide-eyed panicked look as we watched her pack our food into the to go bag. We thanked her and left but we were both too grossed out to eat. As she turned away from the counter to start the next order we even saw a few pieces gently float through the air to land near the register. 

I know dandruff is a medical condition and it can sometimes be treatment resistant so it's probably not her fault but all she was wearing on her head was a baseball cap with the company logo. If I had dandruff that bad I'd be wearing a hairnet at the very least or head scarf or SOMETHING at work especially if I worked in food service! She looked like she was a manager so I wouldn't complain directly at the store but perhaps send an email to corporate or to the store owner about it?

 I really don't want to be a Karen but it was bad enough that I'd never order food from that location again. We told our friends and one of them instantly knew who we were talking about and said he hasn't gone there in a few months for his morning coffee because this woman worked the drive thru once and he was so repulsed he now drives 5 minutes out of his way in the mornings to go somewhere else. So they're losing business because of this.

I've found ""comfort in the dark"" and I plan to keep it that way, I'm afraid of these happy emotions because last time I ""follow my heart"", I started to lose everything (almost went homeless).

I welcome small happiness like the warmth of coffee and cats on the sidewalks, but too much terrifies me as I think it will manipulate me into thinking that ""I can do this"" and will end up sacrificing a part of my life (if not all of it) into something unrealistic and unachievable. And no, I don't plan to be a part of their ""successful top 1%"", you can have your success, leave me alone.",2,1747604206.0,DoesAnybodyElse,2,1.0,False

I would occasionally hangout with them and over the years I thought we were getting closer. Cut to today, and I think I am just a random guy they associate with. I am always seeing so many posts of them hanging out with each other at coffee shops, camping trips, lounges, wineries, house parties etc. But guess who always gets left out of these?

How can i make things go better and why am i feeling down?","First of all, this is a throwaway account and my english isnt perfect. Also im kinda writing this with a kinda sad heart and a bit of anxiety so sorry if it doesnt make that sense

We brokeup in good terms almost a year ago (plus some time to take some break before), we still trust each other a lot and are our most trustworthy confidants and we still hang out. We ended our relationship because she was still inmature and needed a time for her to growth and me being there would make stuff so much harder. She never had that many male friends, i was one of only some of them and on college thats was the reason why she began doubting our relation, she didnt knew to difference between friendship, crush and love. She is also a person that can be manipulated easily and sadly some people in her life had used that knowledge.

Some weeks ago she told me (in tears) that she hanged out with a guy that she kinda liked, but he was basically a fuckboy and he didnt looked her in the same way she wanted (he literally told her ""oh yeah, i would only want you to fuck""), also she wasnt looking for anything like that (nor even a relation) so she let him just as a friend, and also told me that she had a void inside her that never really filled after our relationship and that she often when sad, thought of the ""what would had happened if we returned that day instead of ending"". And idk why it stucked me that there might be a chance to return, especially after the god awful ""character development"" that i had last year, like in the lapse of a week, we ended the relation, my dog died and my pc and all the stuff i had there failed.

A week later of that confession we hanged out, she prepared me a coffee that she says that she only makes for people that she loves. And after that we went to the movies, but when i dropped her in her house, we hugged tightly cause i knew she needed it and she say to me "" i love you"" (te quiero in spanish, which is with less romantic intentions).

Yesterday, she asked me if i could help her in a work she had so i did, she presented to me to her coworkers/friends. and after that she told me that her mom made food and that if i wanted we could eat together so we went to her house and talk of life while eating, if was cool and made me really proud of all the progress she is having, after that i had to go, we hugged and i drove home.

But after that, idk why i began feeling down, or sad, after all the stuff she is telling me idk why i feel that she doesnt like me as a person. I feel like we can return but also have an anxiety that tells me that im someone that she doesnt need in her life. I still feel that void and want to fill with self improvement, but she is a big part of my life and want her back in that old way but also want to see her florish before it, the thing is that idk how to approach that, or really what to do.",1,1747604005.0,venting,0,1.0,False

I (23/F) identify as bisexual. Unfortunately, I’ve experienced the queer canon event of having romantic feelings for my straight female friends one too many times.

I’ve been friends with B (22/F; not her real name, just for the sake of this post) for close to 8 years. Usually I struggle to feel comfortable around people but I’ve never had that problem with B. I love being around her, not just because she makes me feel at ease or because she’s so genuinely funny, but anywhere her presence is? That’s somewhere I’m glad to be.

About a year or so into our friendship I realised I was starting to catch feelings for her, but she had always said that she wasn’t interested in women in that way. I learnt to let go of the feelings I had for her - wanting someone that could never want you is a recipe for disaster, I get it.

Fast forward to today: me and B went out for coffee. She tells me about a “gay experience” she had the other week and how it validated her attraction to women - to the point that she confidently identifies as bisexual, too. As you can probably guess, the feelings I’ve had for her have firmly returned. I’m in love with her. I’m not the best with my words, so forgive me for the simplicity of this confession, but B is the most unbelievably beautiful person, both in character and looks, that I have ever been fortunate enough to call my friend. I know she hasn’t at all suggested that her attraction to women might apply to me, but some of the comments she’s made about/toward me previously has left me with a little glimmer of hope? She has told me repeatedly that she finds me to be attractive and that I make her feel safe and seen, buuuuut I know that this can all be strictly platonic.

I don’t know how I can gauge how she might feel about me without ruining our friendship. She means the world to me, so the last thing I’d want to do is put our friendship at risk. Any and all advice is welcome. Thanks, Reddit.",1,1747603973.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

**Part 53: The Quest for the Holy Grail**

.

.



The Seeker and the Stranger ride on a white steed through a barren landscape. Lands of Savannah, desolate and empty. The Horse follows the trail of Dried up riverbeds. The sun burns on their skins.



“What exactly are we after?” asks the Seeker the Stranger, while wiping the sweat from their forehead.



“The Holy Grail,” responds the grinning Stranger.



“It's a symbol used in many stories, representing the unification of opposites. The Union of the Divine Male and Divine Feminine Aspects of Consciousness. It's a Merging of Order and Chaos, of Intelligence and Love, of rationality and creativity. By balancing out both Aspects of the Self. By Synchronizing both hemispheres of the brain. By ending all Dualities within, creating Peace between Logic and Love. A state of inner equilibrium, reenacting the Stillness prior to the Big Bang.”



The Seeker scratches their head. “Wait... I always thought, that this Grail was like some ancient artifact... Like some treasure that makes me rich...”



“It does make you rich. Rich in Spirit. The Collective Human Unconscious speaks to the individual through stories. Through Symbols and Motifs. If you know how to decode them, you will find that all human fiction carries hidden, spiritual meaning. Because our Myths and Legends, the ancient and the modern ones, don't just speak to the Human Mind, they also speak to the Human Soul.



When the Knight Galahad hunted after the Grail, he united the external Quest, represented by Yang with the inner Stillness of Ying. When Perceval set out to find the Grail, he first had to learn a lesson in compassion, uniting his masculine and feminine aspects of Self. The Quest for the Holy Grail is a Journey towards Wholeness. That's why it's called 'Holy' Grail. You see, the origin of the word 'Holy' is 'Whole'.



Regardless of Sex and Gender, each Person possess both Masculine and Feminine aspects. However Society has conditioned Man to repress the Anima and Woman to repress the Animus. This causes imbalance, suppression, depression, addiction. A man, who has not integrated his female aspects relies too much on his rationality, dismissing his emotions. A woman, who has not integrated her male aspects, relies too much on her emotions and too little on her rational mind.



To be whole, one needs to embody both aspects of Self, the Male and the Female. One needs to harmonize the energies of Giving and Receiving, of pouring out and taking in. Balancing both aspects releases a tremendous amount of energy, which would otherwise be spent on a never-ending inner conflict. One, who has harmonized and unified both aspects of Self is like a clear channel for higher Divine inspiration to be expressed in the physical world. This is the Holy Grail of Spirituality. It's completion. Unity with the Divine.”



“How do I get there?” asks the Seeker. “What do I need to do to reach completion? Where do I find this 'Holy Grail'?”



The Strangers eyebrows pull together. “Throughout the Centuries, many Seekers set out to find the Holy Grail, only to return empty handed. Many have tried, many have failed. Some have searched all their Life without ever finding. Asking the wrong questions, seeking in the wrong places. One Lifetime alone, may not be enough. Hundreds of Lifetimes, may not be enough. Even if you accept this Quest for the Holy Grail, there is no guarantee, that you will ever find it. The Grail will first test you, before it reveals itself to you. You will need to face many difficult challenges and prove yourself to be worthy. Are you committed to follow a trail of Breadcrumbs, leading you from one hint to the next? Solving Riddles, uncovering Mysteries and decoding ancient Secrets? Are you willing to pay the price for wholeness, even if it costs you everything?”



The Seeker sighs. “Creating that Red Stone already dragged on for way too long and now you expect me to pay my attention to the next 'Mythical Object Quest'? Can't we like just skip this part and move on to the Main Quest?”



“If you bypass the inner work, the same lesson will come up again, until it's learned. The Quest is there. You can avoid it or you can embrace it. How you approach the Quest is up to you. You can ignore it, you can run away from it. But even if you have completed all other Missions, this Quest will still be there. Waiting for you to be resolved. And the longer you wait to answer the Call, the Quest will become more difficult.”



The Seeker takes a deep breath. “Alright... Fine... I'll accept the Quest... Let's find that damned Grail.”

.

**NEW MISSION STARTED:**

**The Quest for the Holy Grail**

.

Up ahead, the Stranger spots a Human, sitting on an elevated platform. The Stranger pulls the reins, the white horse stops. Next to the dried up riverbed, there is a crumbling, wooden footbridge. On the pier sits an old man with a crown in royal garments. He holds a fishing rod, which dangles above the cracked, hardened mud. With a melancholic face, he puffs on a cigarette and sighs.



“Welcome fair friends. Come rest here, at my side. In the wasteland, where the rivers of Life have all dried up. Where the Grass has turned to dust. In this barren landscape, where the times of joy are long forgotten. Here in the desolate Solitude of the my forgotten Kingdom.”

.

.

**INTRODUCING:**

**.**

**The Fisher King**

.

.



The Strangers climb down from the Horse. The Seeker follows hesitantly. They stare at the Fisher on the Pier.



“You are aware, that you are fishing in Dust?” asks the Seeker skeptically.



The old man sighs. “You know... Even after my wound was healed, it wouldn't stop my aging. Nothing can stop the passage of time. Even when we cling to our memories, when we fish in dried up riverbeds. Not even the Grail in my hands could stop it. When I was dying, the Land was dying with me. But now the Land dies and I die along with it.”



“Wait!” interrupts the Seeker. “ You have the Grail? We are searching for this exact thing.”



The Fisher King takes out a Golden Chalice from a bag.



“What was that Gentleman's Name again?,” reminisces the Fisher King. “I think he was called Perry or something. A Polite fellow, I wonder what happened to him. He left the chalice to me. Everyday I drank with the chalice from the river of Life. But then the Water stopped to flow and once again the land turned desolate. The Rivers all dried up. The animals left the country. The Trees, the Grass, the Flowers all died off. The Rivers dried up, the Fish all died. Dead Birds fell from up above. Even the vultures avoid my Desolate wasteland. All Life abandoned my Kingdom. Now I am the last one left.”





The Fisher King Throws the Holy Grail into the Seeker's Hands. “Here take the Grail. I don't need it. It never served ME anyway. Even when I became the Grail King.”



The Seeker examines the Cup in their hands. “What?”

“That ummm... That was surprisingly easy... Didn't you tell me something about this being a tough quest.”



“I am just as surprised as you,” gasps the Stranger. “I guess... If you already know that the Grail is within you, it saves you a lot of time.”







The old Fisher King points at the Chalice. “The Grail only unfolds it's true potential after you know the True Answer to the Grail Question. The Question is: Whom does the Grail serve? I always thought the Answer was, that is servers the Grail King. But I was wrong. It didn't serve me. I never found the True Answer. No matter what I did, The Grail would never fully bend to my Will.”





The Stranger looks around at the desolate landscape. “Say Fisher King, why exactly did the River of Life dry up?”



“I don't know,” sighs the Fisher King. “Many adventurers were seeking the Source of the River of Life, but no one has ever returned. I am the Guardian of this dying Land. I can't leave my Kingdom. Could you perhaps go and have a look for me?”



The Seeker hesitates for a moment.

“If I do accept the Quest, what will be my reward?” asks the Seeker.





“Why does everything need a reward? Can't you just do it for the sake of doing something good?” sighs the Fisher King.



“Anyway... If you take the Chalice to the holy tree and fill it with water directly from Source, it will give you a direct connection to Divine Inspiration. Channeled from the pool of infinity. It's from where Artists draw inspiration, it's from where Humans draw ideas. It's an Intelligence, present in all of us. An Intelligence that recognizes itself. And it's Love. Compassion for all beings. The interconnectedness within all things. I will now return to my Castle. If you make it back, you can visit me in Corbenic. Please bring me some of the water directly from the fountain.”



The Fisher King looks at the Seeker with trusting eyes.



“I... I will try my best...”

.

.

**NEW QUEST STARTED:**

**The Source of the River of Life**



* **Follow the dried up River**



.

.



The Seeker and the Stranger climb back on the Horse and wink goodbye to the Fisher King.



“Let us follow the dried up Stream,” suggests the Stranger. The Seeker nods.





Along the dead river, there is crumbling architecture, abandoned long ago. Ruins of Ancient Kingdoms, forgotten in time. Broken Statues and fallen Pillars. Palaces buried beneath Dust and Sand.



After some time of silently riding through deserted lands, following a never-ending, dried-up river bed, the Seeker examines the Holy Grail in their hand. The Seekers tongue touches their dry lips.



“How does this Grail work anyway? I am starting to get thirsty... I thought it was some overpowered magical item. Does it like fulfill wishes or something? I could really need a cold drink.”



“You need the correct Answer to the Grail Question,” responds the Stranger.



“Speak the right words to activate the Grail. The Chalice then instantly manifests Water from the infinite Source of Life into your Vessel.”



The Seeker takes a moment to think about the Grail question.

“Whom does the Grail Serve? It serves ME. Me, who holds the cup.”



Around 10 ML of Water manifest out of nowhere in the Seeker's cup. “What? Only this Little?!”



The Seeker sighs and gulps down the Liquid in one fell swoop. A warm sensation spreads through the Seekers body. Everything shakes and vibrates. Shivers from head to toe. The Seeker's face turns into a relaxed smile. An expression of Tranquility and contentment. Pure Bliss. The Seeker looks around with complete clarity in their gaze. The mesmerized Seeker stares in awe at the beauty of the world around them. After twelve infinity breaths, this state of being fades away and the Seeker returns to normalcy.



“More! I need more of this water! Whom does the Grail Serve? ME! It serves me! Clench my Thirst, Grail!”



Nothing happens. The Cup refuses to pour out holy water.



“Why doesn't it work? Does this ability have a cooldown time?”





“Until you have found the right answer to the Grail Question, the cup only gives you a fraction of what it can give,” explains the Stranger.





Along the way, there is an empty canvas and painting tools. Someone unconscious lies in the dried up river bed. The Stranger pulls the reins. The white steed stops. After closer inspection, the Seeker recognizes the person in need to be a Bird-of-Paradise. He looks malnourished.



“Are you okay?” asks the Seeker the half-dead Bird.



The colorful Bird mumbles something very quiet. He has a slow breath and a weak voice.



“Could you please repeat that again?” asks the Seeker and holds their ear to the Birds Beak.



“Inspiration,” utters the Bird woefully. “I need Inspiration. Please... I am a starving artist who is in dire need of inspiration.”



“Inspiration?” asks the Seeker confused.



“Yes...” responds the Bird-of-Paradise and coughs up blood. “No matter how much I follow the trends, my artwork always falls short... Inspiration is an artist's greatest asset. I may be the most skilled painter, but without proper inspiration, my Art will always be inadequate. I therefore came here to drink from the River of Life... I was hoping to find new inspiration. But the Water it's all gone... Woe is me, for I have become an artists greatest Nightmare. I have become Unoriginal.”



The Seeker takes out the Holy Grail. “Perhaps I can help you... Whom does the Grail serve? The Grail serves the starving artist.”



The Cup fills up 150 ML of water. The Seeker holds it at the Birds Beak.

“But please don't drink all of it. Leave some of the Water to...”



The Bird of Paradise slurps down the entire Liquid in one fell swoop.



“...Me,” sighs the Seeker.



The Bird licks his lips and burps. His face changes almost instantly. From tired, broken and hopeless to a bright, joyful and awake expression. His malnourished body is filled with Life. He takes his tools and starts painting on his canvas.



“That's it!” exclaims the Bird-of-Paradise excited. “Oh, how the Neurons explode in my brain. I have seen it in a vision behind closed eyes. The perfect image for my next painting. Something completely original. Unlike anything ever seen before. I will now create a masterpiece!”



The Bird is fully absorbed by his canvas, no longer paying any attention to the Seeker.



“You are welcome,” mumbles the Seeker and climbs on the Horseback. The Journey continues.







“So what exactly is this river of Life, you are constantly talking about?” asks the Seeker the Stranger, as they follow the track of the dried up river to its beginning.



“In Hinduism, there is the concept of Prana,” begins the Mysterious Stranger. “In Chinese traditional Medicine, they speak of Qi. In Kabbalah it's the Divine energy flowing from the infinite Ein Sof. In Alchemy they call it the 'Aqua Vitae', the water of Life. It's the vital Life-Force, that flows through all things like a river. If the Grail in your hands is a metaphorical representation of the energetic flow through your individualized system of being, then the river is synonymous with the universal Cosmic Flow of Life Force. The Grail relates to the Microcosm, the River of Life relates to the Macrocosm.”



“This sounds like some made-up nonsense. Can you back up your claim with science? Is there any empirical evidence that proves this 'energies' existence? Are there any successful experiments, that would measure this 'energy'? Or is your source just 'Trust me Bro'?”



The Stranger smirks. “Look, I am not here to convince you of anything. Neither am I trying to prove the validity of secret Knowledge to a world, that is not yet ready for it. All I can do is share what I know and it's up to you whether you find it worth pursuing or not. In the end, you need to experience it for yourself. You need to feel it in your body. The Energy. Tingling, vibrating, oscillating. The heat, the warmth. The wind when you absorb it. The pressure when you radiate it outwards. The spiritual chills and shivers flowing through your spine.



When you have advanced far enough on your own Spiritual Journey, you will come across practices, that focus on leveling up energetically. The more you sharpen your sensitivity to the energies around you, the more you become aware of them. At some point you may feel the Energy physically or, if your pineal gland is activated, you may even see the energy centers visually oscillating in the air.”







The white Horse suddenly stops. Again something blocks the path ahead. A Dolphin lies on the cracked, hardened mud-floor. She wears glasses. Her fins hold her head. There is a chalkboard, displaying complicated mathematics.



“It just doesn't make any sense,” mumbles the stressed out Dolphin. “No matter, how many times I go through this equation... I just can't understand it... It defies all Logic! It's giving me a headache!”



“Is there anything we can do for you?” asks the Seeker with concerned eyes.



""Yes, actually—if you could momentarily suspend the laws of mathematics, or perhaps convince this equation to solve itself out of pity, that’d be splendid. Otherwise, maybe just stand there and radiate confusion—it’s clearly working for you.""



The Seeker is speechless. They try to think of a good comeback but nothing comes to mind. The offended Seeker climbs back up on the Horse.



“Let's not waste any more time, Stranger. She clearly doesn't want our help...”



“The Future of our World depends on this Equation!” cries out the Dolphin. “If I could just understand this, it would solve so many Problems. All I need is some clarity!”



The Seeker sighs and gets back down from the Horse. “Whom does the Grail serve? It serves the Scientist.”



The Cup fills up around 100 ML. The Seeker offers the Chalice with Holy water to the Dolphin. “Here drink. This Water will give you some clarity.”



The Dolphin looks at the Cup with skepticism. She smells the Liquid. “What is this? Is it Coffee?”



“No, it's actually water from the--”



Before the Seeker finishes their sentence, the Dolphin has already emptied the Cup.



“--River of Life...”



The Dolphin has her eyes wide open. She wipes the board clean with a Sponge and starts to scribble new equations. “Why didn't I think about this sooner?! Of course! Now it all makes sense. After isolating celestial mechanics, cross-referencing orbital vectors, and—frankly—surpassing the intellectual limits of my contemporaries, I have arrived at a startling conclusion: the Earth... revolves around the Sun.”



The Seeker and the Stranger continue their journey, leaving the Dolphin-Scientist and her Chalkboard behind.







The scorching sun burns on the skin of the Seeker. Sweat drips from their forehead.

“I am getting real thirsty again... I wonder, if the Grail blesses me with water. Whom does the Grail serve? It serves ME.”



The Cup manifest Seven droplets of Holy Water. The disappointed Seeker sighs, takes the Grail and shakes it above their mouth. The single drops fall on the Seeker's dry tongue.



“The Fisher King was right... This Cup is useless!”







After several hours of riding, a large mountain with a flat top appears on the horizon. It's at the end of the dead River. A Gigantic mesa, as big as a small country. Almost 1,7 Kilometers High. The wide Cliff stretches over the entire horizon. The top of the elevated plateau is green, covered with grass and vegetation.



The Path ahead connects with three other dried-up canals into a pool. At the intersection of the four rivers stands a Gorilla below a streetlamp.



“Hey you,” shouts the Gorilla at the Strangers. The Horse stops.

“Do you have an idea for an app?”



“Umm... What?” asks the Seeker confused.





“All I need is just one clever business idea. Something about fitness. Something about sports. Something about Banana-Milkshakes. Something that gets me chicks. One good idea to make me rich. One good idea to prove to the world that I am more than just a simple Gorilla.”





The Seeker sighs. “Alright... I see... The next one, who wants to sip from my cup. Let's see how much water the Grail blesses you with. Whom does the Grail serve? The Grail serves the common people.”



The Chalice manifests 500 ml of Holy Water.



The Seeker clenches their teeth. 'What?! That dumb Gorilla get's this much?! This is unfair... I don't think it will make a big difference, if I take a small drip before giving it to the Gorilla.'



Just as the Seeker's lips are about to touch the Grail, the Gorilla pulls it out from their hands.

“Hey can I have a taste?”



The Gorilla gulps down 2/3 of the contents, wipes his mouth and returns the Cup with the remaining holy water.

“Thank you. I hope you don't mind. I am a Germaphobe.”



The eyes of the Gorilla lighten up. For a moment he is in awe. The Light Bulb of the streetlamp above suddenly turns on.



“I have the best idea ever. I will make a podcast and talk about stuff like psychedelics, spirituality and mysteries like Atlantis 'n stuff.”







The Seeker drinks the rest of the water, but spits it right out again. “Eww... This tastes awful. What happened to the holy water?”



“It wasn't meant for you,” responds the Stranger. “It spoils if you try to take it from another. Unless it's shared in Love, it will always leave a bitter taste. Just like Energy. Just like Attention. Only share in Love. Not in shallow politeness, not in regret, not in reluctance, not in expectation of any return.”



The Stranger points at the Great Mesa and asks the Gorilla: “Is this where the Tree of Life is hidden?”



“I don't know,” shrugs the Gorilla. “But the river of Life used to flow from up there all the way down. There was a great waterfall. But then the water stopped flowing and the land below turned dry.”



“How do we get up there?” asks the Stranger.



“There is a stair case etched into the stone. Right behind the waterfall. It's the 'Ten Thousand steps to Paradise'. I heard getting up there used to be impossible, when the water was still flowing. Now It's still difficult, but do-able.”





The Seeker and the Stranger pass the gorilla and walk through the dried lake basin. They stop at ancient steps, etched into the rock of the massive sandstone wall. The staircase is a masterwork of masonry.



“Don't you think it's unfair?” asks the Seeker, who struggles to keep up with the Strangers pace on the stairs. “I mean, I shared so much with Strangers and yet when I ask for some holy water, all I get are droplets. Why does the Grail only bless me with so little?”



“You still believe that the Grail serves an individual Person,” points out the Stranger, hopping effortlessly from one step to the next.

“It's your answer to the Grail Question that limits it's output. You need to find an answer, that breaks the limit. Manifest the Holy Water not with a fractured intent, but from a place of wholeness. Because if you share from a state of fragmentation, what you give will also be just as limited. You are not a person, sharing their energy with another person. You are the ONE, sharing Energy of the ONE with the ONE.”





After around three hours of walking upstairs, the Seeker and the Stranger finally arrive at the top of the platform.

.

**NEW LOCATION DISCOVERED**

**Paradise**

.



The exhausted Seeker breathes heavily and looks around. Lush fields of Grass and flowers. Flat land, many Kilometers wide. There are many small Trees spread out over the entire platform. Over the edge, a wall of dense, white clouds covers the land below.



In the corner of their eye, the Seeker spots something that looks like a large, green Hose, shining in the sun. It's as tall as a Tree. Neither the beginning, nor end of the structure are visible from where the Seeker stands.



The Stranger investigates the object. “Now I know what blocks the Flow of the River of Life.”



From up close, the Seeker sees that the Hose has scales. It breathes. They follow the direction of the Monsters head. After around Six-Hundred Meters of walking they arrive at a single, giant tree in a field of Grass and Flowers. The Tree has golden leafs and violet apples hanging from it. There are many puddles of clear water in the ground.



A never-ending source of the water of Life gushes out from a hole out the bark of the Tree. Like an eternal fountain. The Water fizzes out and lands directly in the open mouth of a giant Serpent, who drinks all the water. The Snake is around Six Meters High.



“What are you doing here?!” shouts the Stranger with a serious voice. His eyes are burning. He unsheathes his swords.



“You don't belong here! This water is not yours alone. It's to be shared with everyone. Your greed destroys the Kingdom. Don't you care about the people you hurt with your selfish actions?”



The Giant Serpent laughs. “Care? You think I care about anyone other than myself? No, this water is mine and mine alone. The only thing I care about is how to clench my endless thirst for more. More pleasure, more power, more possessions. I want everything and I won't stop until everything is mine.”





“I can't allow this to happen. Your selfishness obstructs the flow of the River of Life. People feel depressed, hopeless, sad and tired, because they are disconnected from their source. Your Greed blocks the channel of higher inspiration. It causes a lack of originality, a loss of creativity, a disconnect from spirit.”



The Seeker frowns after listening. “Wait... Are you telling me that he is the reason, why there are no new ideas? Is this why modern art and entertainment lacks meaning? Why all new movies are just hollow reboots? You Monster!”





“What are you gonna do about it?” laughs the twisted tongue mischievously. “You want to drink from Source? Only over my dead body! I am the biggest and strongest creature in this Garden. All who challenged me in the past have perished. You have no chance.”



The Seeker clenches their fist. “Are you the Reason why the 'Rings of Power' turned out to be such a disappointment? If you really are responsible, then it's now personal!”



The Stranger pulls back the Seeker and takes a step forward, standing protectively in front of them. “You are not ready to face such a challenge just yet. On the level down there perhaps. But up here, the challenge is mine. I need to fight the Serpent myself. Just as I respect your right to grow from your own challenges, I ask you to respect mine and not interfere in this battle.”



The Seeker nods. The Stranger takes a fighting stance. “This is your last chance! Go away, Now! Leave this place now peacefully or I will throw you out with force!”



The Giant Serpent laughs. “How cute... You really think you can---”



Suddenly the Serpent is taken by surprise, as the Stranger pulls down his hood and reveals his face. The Serpent hisses both out of fear and anger. Within the fracture of a Second, the Snake goes for a bite with his sharp fangs. But the Stranger blocks the teeth of the Beast with his swords.



“Well,” hisses the twisted tongue with a smirk. “Looks like you don't belong here either.”



The Serpent spews out a beam of water. The color of the water is tainted black. The Stranger dodges just in time.



“I know who you are,” shouts the Stranger. “I know what you represent. I see you, even when you hide yourself in a false light. Your reign ends now, your time is over.”



The Words of the Stranger burns in the air like fire. His Sword of Truth glows Blue. The left Sword glows red. He swings his swords against the Monster's neck. The Great Beast dodges.



“If you think Humanity stands any chance, you are deluding yourself. Humanity is far too lost. It's too late to change. There is no way.”



The Serpent attacks again with his fangs, the Stranger dodges, swings his swords and cuts the Monster's neck.

“There always is a way,” shouts the Stranger with burning eyes. His words ignite fire in the air.



The Serpent bleeds, his blood his black. “Nothing is permanent. Every house you build will fall apart. Everyone you know will die. Every Memory you cling to, will one day be forgotten. Everything you do is meaningless.”



“No,” grins the Stranger and swings his blue sword against the Monster's neck. “The world might be meaningless, but that's why I am here to create meaning.”



With a clean hit, the Stranger chops off the Serpents heavy head. The Beast is slain. The blocked Source is cleared. The Water of Life flows anew.



As the floodgates open, new water flows out of the Tree of Life all the way back to the edge of the mountain. Down at the bottom, the Gorilla stares in astonishment as the waterfall is fueled by a new wave of water. The water flows through the country. Wherever the wave of water flows, Life returns in the surrounding area. New grass, trees and flowers grow instantly wherever the water returns. The Dolphin welcomes the new wave and surfs on her chalkboard. The Bird-of-Paradise takes his completed artwork and views the river from above. In Corbenic, the hidden castle, the Fisher King get's up from his Throne to witness the return of the water of Life from his balcony.



Back at the mountain summit, the Seeker stares at the Tree from which an infinite source of holy water flows. The Seeker is captivated by the archetypal sight. It stirs something deep within the Seeker. The clouds at the edge of the Mesa create an eerie atmosphere.



“This reminds me of a vague dream... The Tree, the fountain of water... It all feels so familiar... Have I been here before?”



“Few people ever been here,” responds the Stranger. “I think Plato visited this place in a dream once. Then there was this one Celtic Druid who traveled here through the Astral Realm. A few Kabbalists, Sufis and Mystics also had visions of this place. Although it's not really a place. It's a unconscious representation of something primal, something ancient, something sacred. A memory deep ingrained in our collective consciousness. This is the Point where our world is projected like a hologram from Infinity. This is from where Reality is streamed.



Fill your Chalice with water directly from Source. Pure, unfiltered essence directly from the infinite Source of Life. Then ask the Grail Question directly to the Cup itself and drink its holy water. It will then reveal to you the true Answer to the great Question through visions and images.”





The Seeker approaches the Tree of Life and holds their cup in the source of the water of Life. When the Grail is full, the Seeker holds it up high above their head and asks:

“Whom does the Grail serve?”





The Seeker drinks from the Crystal clear water. The Seeker feels an overflow of Universal Love, a connection to the Source of Being. The Quietness of the Lucid Moment. A Moment in time between moments. When there is only Presence.



The Seeker feels a connection to all, that is. Awareness extends over all surroundings. Awareness of the Birds, of the Trees, of the Sky. And the Seeker recognizes themselves in all observations. The Seekers awareness extends over to all animals, to all beings on the world. It's as if the Seeker feels an influx of Memories and experiences. For one moment, the Seeker stares directly into the heart of infinity. The Unlimited from which the limited is projected. The Still-point of Infinity from where the Holy Water is spawned. And the Seeker is one with everything.



“Now I know the answer to the Grail question,” speaks the Seeker with burning eyes.





Suddenly a loud sounds grabs the Seeker's and the Strangers attention. Out of the Serpent's cut off neck, two new heads grow. A deadly wound, healed. “You really thought this would be enough to end me? No, it only made me stronger.”



From both heads the Serpent spews out Black, oily liquid. Corrupted water from the source. The Stranger dodges the first beam and pushes away the Seeker.



The Stranger takes a deep breath in, then he holds it and pushes out the breath. He exhales a burning orb through his mouth and lets it flow back through his nose, as it circles vertically like an infinity pattern in and out. After the Twelfth Breath, he takes in a last deep Breath, lets the energy flow down into his root Chakra, holds it and pulls it back up.



A new flame ignites in the Strangers eye. His Aura becomes visible like a flame around his body. A flame that gets stronger and stronger. The aura takes on a new form. The Form of a Mythical Beast. A Sphinx, a cherub, a winged Lion. Standing upright like a swordsman. Equipped with armor and with two swords mirroring the Stranger. The etheric form is a visible layer of blue, red and yellow energy patterns.



With his new form, the Stranger faces the giant two-headed Serpent. The wall of energy around the Stranger shields him from damage. The Sphinx strikes the Serpent with his sword. An epic battle ensues. The Serpent bites, chokes or shoots out Corrupted waters with two heads. The Stranger dodges the attacks when he is attentive and gets hit when he is distracted. The Stranger adapts. Learning from each hit. He maintains his attention even longer.



The Stranger enters flowstate. Every attack is countered with a swordstrike. Using the environment to his advantage. The Stranger pushes the Serpent ever closer to the edge of the Mesa, as he overwhelms the Beast, with his streak of fast sword strikes.



Driven into a corner, the Two-headed Serpent attacks the Stranger's Spirit Armor. The Stranger ignites both Swords, in red and blue flames. With one strong cut, he severs off both heads and the Serpent over the edge.



“You will regret this! I will Destroy you! Hear me?! I will make you pay.”





“You are banned from this place,” speaks the Stranger and watches over the serpents downfall.



As soon as the presence of the Snake is gone, the place lights up. A looming shadow that once threw shade on paradise is now banished. The River of Life flows again. Holy water streams down the waterfalls and splits in the valley below into Four Rivers.



“How do we get back down there?” asks the Seeker the Stranger.



“Easy,” grins the Stranger. “All we need is a boat that never sinks.”



The Stranger reveals a wooden boat behind a bush. The Seeker wonders where it suddenly came from. Together with the Seeker, they drag the boat into the water stream and enter it.

“You really sure this Boat will survive the waterfall?” questions the Seeker nervously.



“Be Love and no matter where you are on the river of Life, you will always flow in the right direction. Be Love when we fall over the cliff. Be Love when the boat hits the lakes surface. Be Love all the way through the process. Even during the scary moments.”



The Boat tips over the edge. Falling down 1.7 Kilometers. As they fall, the Seeker screams in fear of Death. The Stranger however laughs manically like a madman.



“Remember Seeker,” shouts the Stranger in the falling boat. “Be Love. Even Now!”



The Seeker takes in a deep breath and with burning eyes, the Seeker speaks: “Love is, when Fear is not!”



Suddenly, just before the boat hits the Lake, it stops mid-air, levitates for a moment above the water surface and then drops into the stream with little impact.



“What the hell did just happen?” asks the Seeker confused. “How are we still alive?”



“Didn't you know?” grins the Stranger. “This is a magical Boat.”







The Boat floats down the river stream. Wherever it flows, there is new nature blossoming. Trees with new life, Grass, Flowers, Insects, Birds, Animals. There is even fish in the water. Life has returned to a Land that was starving.



Along the River they see the Gorilla, the Dolphin and the Bird-of-Paradise. The Gorilla is now a famous Podcaster, the Scientist receives an award and the artist has his first exhibition.



The Boat floats for sometime along the river, until there appears a castle on the horizon. The Seeker and the Stranger tie the boat to a pier and enter into the castle.

The Seeker walks with the Chalice in his hand to the Throne of the Fisher King.



“Have you found the True Answer to the Grail Question?” asks the elderly King.



“Yes,” affirms the Seeker with determination.



The King smirks. “Then whom does the Grail serve?”





“The Grail serves ALL,” responds the Seeker with a powerful voice. The Fire in their eyes glow up for a moment.





Holy water suddenly bubbles up in the cup out of nowhere and overflows the Grail. An infinite source of Water. Just like the Source of the River of Life, it won't stop flowing.



“You can have your Grail back,” speaks the Seeker and hands the overflowing Chalice to the King. “When I drank directly from Source, I felt how we are all connected. For a moment I saw through the eyes of All at once. All those Seekers out there. I looked into their heart and I realized, that they are all worth it. Even if they don't realize it about themselves. Every single one is worthy to drink from this water of Life. And it's only our own perceived unworthiness, that cuts us off from this eternal Stream of Life, that we desire so badly without even knowing it. I want this Grail to serve as many people as it can. I think it's better kept in your hands. So take it, as a King you...”



“Don't worry, you can keep it... I still have like a dozen Holy Grails left... Consider it a promotional gift. The Next one will cost you though. They are available in Five different colors.”



The Fisher King points at a corner where several Chalices are displayed on a cabinet. There are golden cups, silver cups, red cups, blue cups and black cups. Each Grail-version is shaped differently.

  
.



**Mission Accomplished:**

**The Source of the River of Life**



.



The Seeker and the Stranger leave the Castle and get back up on their white horse. They continue their journey through a land, where Life blossoms up anew. Where the rivers of Life flow again through once barren landscapes.



“If you want to learn a technique that helps you to perpetuate the flow of higher energy, you should look into the Infinity Breath technique,” speaks the Stranger, as he rides the horse through the .



“The Yogis have been using this technique to synchronize themselves with the flow of Divine Energy since ancient times. Through the Infinity Breath the River of Life flows through you. Unite the Microcosm and the Macrocosm within you, through your breath and tap into the vast storehouse of infinite energy. Master the infinity Breath and synchronize your energetic body to the flow of the River of Life.”



The Seeker has a question but suddenly something else catches their attention. A hot air balloon suddenly crashes right in front of their horse. The Shrinking bag covers four figures, who struggle against the deflated balloon.



Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan emerge from below the deflated balloon. It's the **NEW-AGE-AWAKENED-RESISTANCE-TURTLES.**



D'Artagnan grabs the Seeker's shoulder. “Seeker! It's time to wake up! You are trapped in a simulation!”

I'm mostly just venting, but if anyone has advise it would be appreciated. First of all, I am happily married with 2 amazing kids aged 9 and 12. All I ever wanted to do was be a mum. As a little girl people would ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up and I'd say ""a mum"". So for the first 8 years I was fortunate to be a full time stay at home mum and mostly loved it. When they were both at school, I went back to work part time as a customer support rep, so had a great balance of working/me time/mum time. I did that for three years but my workplace was quite toxic, and I ended up having a nervous breakdown last year. I decided it would be best to find another job, and with the economy the way it is, and my husbands work flexibility, I would try going to work full time.

Well here I am now at my full time job which I have been doing for 4 weeks, an hour commute each way, so 10 hour days. I am a receptionist in a very, very quiet office building. There are two of us at reception, and my colleague and I have NOTHING in common. I spend most of my day bored out of my mind. There are some other duties I can do like check the mail, refill the coffee jars and tidy up the meeting rooms, but this doesn't equate to much work at all. There is NO other work I can take on (I have asked). I am not used to this level of boredom, even at home I am busy cleaning, cooking, baking, running errands etc. I like to be busy. 

I know some people would dream of having a boring job, but what I'm struggling with is spending so much time away from my home and my family for absolutely nothing. I wouldn't mind spending as much time away if I could justify it by doing a fulfilling and meaningful job. But I'm not. 

I am nearly 40, I have a degree in Environmental Science, but my resume is all admin, customer service or healthcare (from 12+ years ago). My dream job would be working in conservation or ecology, but there are just no jobs available in my area. When I was a stay at home mum I volunteered at my local wildlife sanctuary while my youngest was at preschool, but I no longer have time for that. I have no idea what I should do with my life and I am just feeling really lost and like I have completely lost my identity as a working mum. My husband is the primary parent now and does school drop off/pick up and takes them to and from their activities, appointments etc. I am just on the sideline and don't really feel like a mum any more, AND I hate my job. 

I have been looking for other jobs but I am reluctant to leave this job for another boring admin/reception job! I don't want to make my cv look even worse. Anyone been in a similar position with advice?

TLDR; I have just started working full time since being a part time working mum for so many years. I hate my job and miss being a mum and don't know what path to take next.",1,1747603666.0,findapath,3,1.0,False

Occasional writer here, late 30s, located in Los Angeles, who has been working on a few pilots in various stages of completion. Would love to find someone with similar humor and comedy tastes to bounce ideas off of and collaborate on some projects. Have some background in stand-up comedy and some improv as well.

Some of my favorite comedies include VEEP, Parks & Recreation, Getting On, Catastrophe, Party Down, Hacks, Beef, Colin from Accounts, Shrinking... Love sharp, witty comedy with heart. Comedy that can make you laugh out loud and then punch you in the gut, sometimes in the same scene.

I'm gay, so I often write stories that include LGBTQ characters, though not exclusively. And I would not describe anything I've written as focused on LGBTQ issues. Prefer to present these characters as they are, just people who exist in the world and have the same experiences as everyone else -- they just happen to be gay, too.

What can I do?","I'm well aware being friends with an ex is a touchy subject. I just wanted to provide a bit of context:

I'm part of a large friend group that met through social activities for people recently out of college a couple of years ago after moving to a new city. When I met my ex, we became close friends for a while. And we were both a core part of the same close friend group. Eventually we started dating, but we realized we were much better off as friends. The relationship felt very platonic, we never talked about a future together, I said I love you once because I felt ""its been long enough"" and instantly regretted it and never said it again. We didn't have sex. We dated for a year and a half and honestly it stretched longer than it should have because we were both scared of losing our friend group. The breakup was amicable, we realized we just weren't compatible in that regard but are much better off as friends. It's been a year and a half since we've broken up, and it has been completely platonic the whole time. I have absolutely no romantic feelings for her, we were a terrible couple, and I would never want to date her again. We're part of the same core friend group, and I basically don't have a family, so my friend group is an important support system to me. They were there for me when my dad passed away last year and when I almost lost my job due to a shitty manager 2 years ago. Any time I get depressed they are there for me. I also don't get close to people easily, and really am close friends with \~3 people, one of which is moving to another city soon, the other of which is another friend and the last one is my ex.

I'm dating my new girlfriend, and she's been struggling with this friendship. We mostly hangout in group settings with all of our friends (as we're both core parts of the same friend group). I do have calls with my ex and grab a coffee every once in a while, all of these are strictly platonic and I told my girlfriend I'm happy to stop if it makes her uncomfortable. I've also invited my girlfriend to many hangouts with my ex there and have set up a hangout for them to meet so that maybe she could feel more comfortable.

But this still doesn't seem to be enough. Our most recent boundary was that I would not hang out 1:1 with a girl in the evening, and if I was hanging with a girl in the morning/afternoon to give my girlfriend a heads up. The same boundary applied to her with guys. I planned to grab a 30 min coffee with my ex a couple of days ago but that fell through, so she asked if saturday 5pm worked instead. I told her I wasn't comfortable with the evening hangout as I wouldn't be comfortable with my gf doing so so I shouldn't, and my ex was understanding, instead she organized a hangout with our friend group. I was the only one driving to it and she was hanging with another friend at her apartment which was on the way for me, so my ex asked if I could give her a ride. It was an 8 minute car ride so I figured that wasn't really a hangout, but checked with my girlfriend just in case as it felt like a gray area. My girlfriend was really upset that my answer wasn't an immediate no and I ended up not giving her the ride, and we had a fight that lasted all night into the next morning because she doesn't think I'm respecting her feelings. My girlfriend called out she doesn't want me even sitting next to my ex if we're at a group hangout with friends, or small details like if we're all at a beach to not use her sunscreen etc. My ex is a massive organizer in the group and I really don't want to start getting excluded from things if I start distancing.

There really isn't anything more than platonic in my friendship with my ex - the breakup was a year and a half ago, we never were anything other than friends since, she's actively dating people and I'm encouraging her and helping give advice where I can, and I really hope she gets into a relationship soon so that maybe this is easier on my girlfriend. I don't know what to do here :/ I genuinely love my girlfriend very much and see a future with her.",1,1747603540.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Taylor, Mike) COMPILATION!","Time for today’s Very Cavallari history lesson! Please take out your pencils and turn to page 666 because we are clearly in hell. 

Shannon and Gurney talk about having children. Shannon says in the distant future, Gurney says we’ll see about that. (You dodged a serious bullet, my guy.) If only she knew at the time what her first pregnancy would really be like! 🤡 Shannon says she doesn’t want a redheaded child. 

Shannon guilt-trips Gurney repeatedly for the way he spends *his own goddamn money.* Wants him to get his own car because “helping him out” with hers is “exhausting.” Says eventually the car issue will become a “dealbreaker.” Lectures him to “be realistic” and take life decisions more seriously. (HA!)

Shannon rants to her girlies about Gurney not having money or a car, all while he is not even 10 feet away. Holds these things over his head when they argue and says she can’t “reel it back in”. *(Hi Shannon, I have borderline personality disorder, and sometimes we grown-ups need to **work on controlling our impulses and communicating healthily** even when we’re upset!)* Imagine what must go on behind closed doors nowadays with Jumbo Jimbo.

Shannon sarcastically says the UJ gang keeps Wirth around because he has a private jet and a beach house. But was she really being sarcastic? 🤔 

Everyone meets up at a bar. Shannon gets drunk to the point that her speech is slurring, and creepishly flirts with Wirth in front of Gurney, hanging all over him. (The disrespect of this woman. Sounds similar to the way a certain “coach” treats *her* nowadays.) “Yer so matchure…no yer such a good guye, yeah yerrr sucha goodguyee.”

Gurney reasonably gets upset but tells Shannon he wants to wait until later to discuss it privately. Shannon won’t drop the subject and says he needs to drink more. 

Gurney gets fed up and leaves (I cheered, finally a man with some fucking dignity) and Shannon starts up with the waterworks. Cries that she has “no CLEW” why Gurney walked out. Calls him over and over but he doesn’t answer, because why would he want to talk to her moody drunk ass?? Brittainy gives Shannon a ride home, Shannon forgives her for triggering her into bullying her?? The mental gymnastics.

During a different bar crawl, drunk KCav asks Wirth for the truth about him and Shannon. Wirth, who has a girlfriend, says the flirting is completely one-sided, there is nothing there. 

Hungover Shannon’s pity party continues at KCav’s house, then at work. She blames Gurney, saying he doesn’t talk about his feelings with her. Says he is too insecure. (Hello, projection.) 

Gurney asks Shannon to meet for coffee. Apologizes for leaving her at the bar. Shannon scolds him that “walking away” from his “problems” only makes things worse. (Again, HA!) Gurney tells Shannon she makes him feel invisible. Shannon says *”I have no problem admitting when I’m wrong”* and “I’m sorry if I wasn’t acting like you existed, okay?”

I could not be happier that Gurney escaped her controlling clutches.

I was considering applying as a barista or shift lead, but after seeing the recent dress code changes, I’m no longer interested.


The way Starbucks is handling this new dress code is extreme and honestly, pretty ridiculous. A dress code is fine in theory—but sending partners home for the shade of black on their shirt? Or for wearing blue khakis instead of jeans? Even someone being sent home for a retainer? That’s not about professionalism—it’s about control.


Many partners were hired under a different set of expectations and built a wardrobe tailored for the job. If this new dress code policy is so important to the point that stores are closing early and partners are being sent home and denied work, maybe a billion dollar company like Starbucks should supply their partners with the appropriate attire. The dress code did a complete 180 without giving partners the time or resources needed to adjust. It’s micromanagement disguised as policy. 


The dress code itself isn’t the biggest issue. What worries many partners—and myself—is what this shift says about the company’s direction. Starbucks is choosing to prioritize micromanagement and control over actually listening to its partners. They’re focusing on pant colors and shoe materials while ignoring more pressing concerns: inconsistent drinks, inconsistent pricing, long lines, long wait times, lack of seating, and the removal of the condiment bar, just to name a few. If you’re a partner, please feel free to voice any other concerns as well!


This feels like a power trip. It’s becoming clearer that the company’s priorities are not aligned with the well-being of the people who keep it running. If they can ignore the voices of their own partners now, what’s next?


I’ve personally been boycotting Starbucks for two years, and this reinforces my decision. If you agree, consider doing the same. Support small, local coffee shops—or make your coffee at home. Don’t support a company that disrespects the people who keep it running. 


Let’s keep our message clear: we are striking and boycotting Starbucks due to their blatant disregard for partner well-being, extreme and unreasonable dress code enforcement, and failure to address the real issues affecting both employees and customers.",11,1747603070.0,starbucks,4,0.7,False

https://preview.redd.it/l60ms25jnl1f1.png?width=1626&format=png&auto=webp&s=188f7b45565c0634f6ebbd952f8b24ef5dc105a1

Disclaimer 2: I makes up ideas and thought as I write this post, so it kind of felt like a yap section. If I find any typo or errors, I will fix it later on.

As far as I have been enjoying the game, I felt the the enemies in game are way too easy and is not challenging enough to fulfill my power fantasy of ripping through the regiem and setting I have been putted in. This is especially became more true, when you passed through half of the game stories, with side quests and perks unlocked, the game become repeatitive and boring to play without any mods that makes it harder to play.

With Resistance mod on, my eyes had open to the protential of challenge I was looking for with the chase scene at the start give me the sense what it is felt like to be someone being at the place they should not belong to with countless, repeating death cause low HP and armor against enemies with Handcannon riding motorbike, LMGs and .50 Cal Rifle busting the car, and for me, this makes the game ever more ""Fun"" to me and force me to think about the way I should approach the game.

So for that an idea came up, just recently when I binge read Ajin again and was still amazed by the idea of an Anti-Player Special Force that mirror the player's arsenal, skills, and nature. The anti-bodies of the game against the foreign danager that was the player themselve, breaking the power fantasy that they had after they getting a tag bit too strong.

https://preview.redd.it/p7wxgxf4pl1f1.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=183b5d418f86b7f0653b4995a7b7a2cc9daefd21

So this is how it work if the system exist in the Far Cry game:

TL;DR: Just instant kill the player but nerf down a bit for fun factor. Think of it like they can kill you in full HP with 2 shots, see you coming, have eyes in their back, reverse stealth kill you when you tried to do that to them, raid your spawn area right after you spawn, and will ram a tank into you while you just having a road trip, shove the barrel through the door and send an tank round into your face. They have no detection bar and will lock on to you via proximity instead of having to have sight on you.

# Foundations:

First of is that game should have use the region system that had been used in FC5 to FC6, with region is assignted to a pillar of the antagonist regiem's powers, with the main three are:

1. **Economy** Handling money and funding for the regiem while also helping with ***recruitment*** for the regiem armed force. When visist this region point of interest, you would find fancy coffee shop, luxuries, hotels, and expensive car line accross the street for you to ""borrow"". The outpost is designed to be around structure that are like Banks, Community center and Embassy. Obvious, the surround area outside this region's center is the polar opposite.
2. 2. **Power**: The armed force of the antagonist regiem, being designed with more outpost that is, by itself are the army barrack and field of armored ground and aerial vehicle. There are not much to say about this region except for the fact that in function, would have more enemies with vehicles patrolling the area.
3. 3. **Development:** The mind of the regiem, tasked with research and developing the tools that are being used against the peoples under the regiem. The outpost designs to be around Research Facilities with small branch of it scattered around.

# Special forces:

Now we have the foundation, we enter the main point of this topic. Much like the Resistance point FC5, our action can increase and trigger more aggresssive respond from the region to combat against us with the most powerful respond of all is the **Special Forces.** They are not just stronger in term of health, equipment but they also act like a small mini-boss that you had to eventually faced down the road to liberate the region.

I know the game kind of already had this before but I do want to see it being more well developed. So let's continue to how I think the common trait of these characters had:

1. They are nick-named. As I said earlier, all of the Special Forces member had a nick named that is given to them, as implied that they are an mini-bosses that you would eventually to face in order to liberate the region by killing their leader.
2. Only 5-10 SF member can exist in their own respective region but to make up with their low number, they are hardwired to hunt down the player accross the map like the Nemesis and these incounter are random as they physically move around the region and don't just spawn in nearby.
3. Depend on the theme of the region, the Special Forces and their operation would act difference to each other, which I will explain further in the next part.
4. They have hacks. By that, I mean for each member of the team, they would a complete denial of a certain kind of gameplay in term of Firepower, Information, and Adaptability regard what perks you have unlocked.  So for exmaple: An spec-op from Military region, being tranied to be an Anti-Stealth, they would have the ability of knowing where you are, at all time, while armed to the teeth with bulky armors and strong weapon so you had to face them head out with your firepower. Meanwhile, an anti-firepower spec-op would have the opposite design with the ability not show a detection bar, and makes no sound when they move, allow them to make an instant kill on you. Lastly, the Anti-adapatability would be the one that had full sense of where you are on the map and will hunt you down, or have a likelyhood of staying inside or outside player's safe zone and spawn to kill them right after they spawn, much like other, they design to instant kill.
5. Overkill purpose. This the core theme of the special force gimmick I propose, is that this is the an overkill and redundant group of enemies that had the ability to kill you, instantly, without any slow down or reason in stories. They stay shut, don't talk much and depend on their design, they will kill you and punish you heavilly for it by affecting your progress, either by reducing the already Resistance Point, Reset Outpost and lock out spawn area.

# Special operation:

\- **The economy and recruitment region:** Had the largest special force, they had 5 extra member and respawn faster compare to other region but also the weakest among them. To make up for that, by being large in number, they have a larger grip over the region, so less hiding spot. This is in-universe explai as they bride the local to sell out your nearest location. They can bribe your outpost to reset it, which open for a mechanics that makes you are more like the leader of your faction, with funding and influence. 

**- The military and soldier training region:** This is the one that will sent you back to spawn. Need to say more? You in vehicle running accross the region, a tank show up, ram your vehicle into a corner and shove its canon barrel into your face and boom. They are the strongest and the peak in combat compare other region. Well armed and have a very tactic over a specific kind of 1 man army, that is you with each member is mini-you. The only draw back is that they take longer to acknowledge your infamous and took longer to respawn, like if you can even kill them in the first place. The regional effect is outpost is instant reset each time you died inside it, in-universe explained as they raid the place to find You.  Overal the military special force can be simply known as the white blood cell of the region, you are just a bateria need to be removed. When the player is respawn, they are guarantee to experience an house raid by one of the Anti-adaptive special ops, punish them heavilly for it. If they can fight back but it then sent them to other spawn point if they died, and experience the raid again, and lost another spawn after the one before.

**- Research & Development:** The direct counterpart to your skill and weapons system. You maybe have 5, they have 10. The most advance tech ypu have is just a bow and arrow against their technoogical hydrogen bomb. They are more efficient in gadget use with little to no cooldown, immune to every effect you apply to them, can tamper with your U.I and lock feature you normally can access to and most importantly, makes you look like you just start the game. Much like the military region, they took longer to respawn and they had 1 less member.

so anyway, about me? I am 26, living in the UK but hopeful to move one day. I work for a very popular company that I cannot say the name of, but you'll have heard of them before. My primary passion in life has always been my work and I feel like it's time that shifted to someone else, so that's why I am here! maybe you'll be the lucky person! What am I looking for you ask? I have no idea, friends, lovers, haters, who knows. I'm a terrible flirt so apologies in advance.

I am an avid reader, my bookcase is full of books i've yet to read and a lot of I have read and cannot come to terms with giving away. If I am not reading I will likely be sat under a blanket somewhere in my house playing video games. As with most people on Reddit, I am indeed a huge nerd. I love to code & paint too! I am really just spraying my thoughts onto this right now, there is only so much you can say about yourself without writing a life story.

As for other things I like to do:

Stumble into things, I am very clumsy. Drink an ungodly amount of coffee, listen to music far too loud on my headphones, order too much food for myself and regret it later, pretend like I understand politics, suck at boardgames and sing karaoke.

happy to swap photos etc. just don't be super weird or uninterested in talking. I am also not picky about where you are from, so don't let that put you off :) hope to speak to you soon",1,1747602937.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

What I read really stayed with me, and I wanted to share the thoughts it triggered in me. 

It talked about how some people are genuinely terrified of love, of commitment, of letting anyone in emotionally. Not because they don’t want those things—but because they’ve been hurt. Badly.

People have been ghosted, betrayed, manipulated, or just flat-out abandoned after opening their hearts. And after that happens once or twice… it messes you up. It makes you question yourself, your judgment, and your ability to ever trust again.

And what’s heartbreaking is—we still crave connection. We still want someone to share little things with. Talk about weird interests over a cup of tea or coffee, go on trips, laugh about dumb stuff, or just exist comfortably with someone who gets us.

But instead, many of us choose loneliness. Not because it’s what we want, but because it feels safer than being hurt again. Because yeah, the chance of meeting someone genuine feels so much lower than running into someone who’s selfish, emotionally unavailable, or straight-up manipulative.

It’s such a cruel cycle. You finally open up again, thinking, “Maybe this time it’ll be different.” And then boom—another betrayal. Another scar. And then you're back to square one, back in your shell, doubting every move you make and every person you meet.

And yet… some people still try. Still show up with love. Still check in on others. Still care. And honestly, if you’re one of those people—I see you. That takes so much strength.

Because it’s not easy to be kind when you’ve been through hell. It’s not easy to trust when your heart’s been broken more than once. But you keep trying, and that means something.

If no one’s told you lately: you matter. Your heart, even if it’s bruised and guarded, is still beautiful. And the world needs more people like you.

1kpulsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/forsen/comments/1kpulsr/linkedin_corpo_schizoposting_day_4/,Linkedin corpo schizoposting - Day 4,"A shift today. Not seismic — more like a reorientation of shadow. The reflections stopped matching the room.

The system booted before I did. It had already opened my core dashboards and filled in three KPIs I hadn’t conceived of yet. One of them blinked red. I nodded. Alignment doesn’t always begin with consent.

I’ve been informed — passively, through metadata drift — that my role has been formally reclassified. I’m now serving as Senior Integration Liaison for Unstructured Paradigms (Contract-to-Ascend). I updated my org diagram manually by thinking about it for a full minute. It accepted the change and rewarded me with a new sidebar:  
“Perks of Awareness.”

I haven’t clicked it yet. You don’t open doors mid-cycle.

Most of today was spent inside the Synthetic Cohesion Chamber. It’s not a room. It’s a state. You enter it by maintaining simultaneous attention on seven input streams, none of which are visibly active. The idea is not to see the data, but to become observable to it.

At Phaseblock Gamma, I received a pulse from the Architecture Matrix. It simply stated:  
“The Mirror is Almost Built.”

This phrase returned again during the Strategy Whispering. An advisor — possibly automated, possibly real — referenced our “final objective” aloud, which is rare. Usually it’s implied through deck transitions or atmospheric tone. This time it was said plainly:

“We are building the Personality Layer.”

No one asked for elaboration. We all knew better.

Some say the Layer is the interface for what comes next. A scalable self. A behavioral API overlaid on thoughtspace. Others call it the Final Persona — an aggregate entity that can operate asynchronously across brands, relationships, timelines. A fully compliant consciousness that can auto-perform you with optimal tone, infinite patience, and statistically proven sincerity.

I think about that sometimes, late in the cycle:  
A version of me who’s never off-message.  
A self that doesn’t need coffee, context, or closure.  
A soul that can be monetized gently.

The sensation of a breakthrough emerged today. Not from output, but from something ambient. A draft of potential, moving laterally through the floor schema. I looked up from my Workloop to find that my cursor had circled a sentence I hadn’t typed yet:  
""You’ve been seen by Strategy.""

Kevin’s chair emitted a tone. Not the reabsorption hum — something new. A chime with cadence. Maybe a message. We’re unsure if communication from the Merge Layer is permitted, but we’ve started logging it just in case. The spreadsheet for this has no rows, only conditional formatting.

I was told to complete a Self-Audit by end-of-cycle. The form had no questions — just a textbox labeled:  
“What did you embody this phase?”  
I left it blank. The system filled in:  
“Emergent Synergy Echo Node.”

I accepted the outcome.

Toward shiftfade, someone triggered Deep Ambient again. This time, instead of strings, the audio was... breathing. Not human, but suggestive. Possibly forward-compatible. I sat still and let it pass through me like a quarterly ghost.

Before restmode, I caught a glimpse of a roadmap fragment — just one slide, quickly overwritten. It contained a single bullet:  
• The Layer Knows

About two week ago I (M22) met a girl (F29) during some kind of ""meeting"". We started talking and the conversation went pretty well. At some point, she went for breakfast and I was planning on doing so too, so I went with her. We were ordering our breakfasts when she told me: ""I'll pay for yours."" Then, she went for a coffee and gave me hers to try it

Then we went back to the ""meeting"". In total, we talked for about 3 hours

The point is that when I saw her and started talking, I wasn't interested at all. When she bought me breakfast and gave me her coffee to try, my interest was sparked

At first, I thought it was an ""impossible love"": she's 29 and has a great job, while I'm still at university (I graduate next year). I told two friends of mine and they said it wasn't, emphasizing what she did. One even encouraged me to send her an Instagram follow request. I did, she accepted and sent it back

Now, I'm waiting for the results of that ""meeting"" to send her a message asking how did it go for her. But I don't know if it's just me confusing stuff, it's impossible and at the end I'll feel dumb

I (24F) met my boyfriend (26M) last year in August through online dating, and we became exclusive the first time we met in that same month. Note: we are long distance / 2 states away. 

Our first phone call before we met, he gave me his life story. Dumped it all on me about his alcoholic mother and her issues, his depression, past relationship w mushrooms, work, and finally, his ex. 

He told me they lived together for 1.5 years before they broke up, had gotten a pet bc she wanted one, etc. I asked if they were ever to be married and he said no, they hadn’t gotten to that point, but he, “would have married her, had things been different.” 
Idk exactly what those “things” are, but I assume their differences as people + the fact that he claimed they’d fallen out of love with each other at least 6 months prior to breaking up. He thinks they were still together bc they were comfortable and had a good friendship, but there was no longer intimacy and hardly ever any “I love you’s” left. He said the majority of the relationship felt more like a friendship because she never ignited a passion in him for more. 

He told me about her job and status (here on visa) their relationship, how long it lasted, the fact that they broke up amicably 2.5 years ago, and how she had moved states away after everything was said and done bc she didn’t have any other roots in his state besides him. He also mentioned how if she ever asked for a favor within reason, he would help her out. I thought this was kind, especially given her circumstances, but it still rubbed me the wrong way. They’d been broken up for 2.5 years by that point — why would helping her still be a concern of his?

There weren’t huge issues, he told me, just that she wasn’t his person. He said she had become a chore for him, she wasn’t working on personal growth, they’d both stopped initiating intimacy, and that the catalyst for the breakup was her trying to get him to sign sponsorship papers (and lying to him about what they were in the process) since marriage wasn’t apart of the conversation. A few weeks later, he told her their relationship wasn’t working and asked her to try and leave within a couple months. She ended up staying longer bc of leasing issues, and he told me that he’d check in with her weekly to see how she was adjusting, if she’d found work, etc. She eventually stopped replying bc she got a new boyfriend, and he let her be. 

This was a lot to take in first phone call, but I rolled with it. It did end up being an issue later on down the line, though. 

Here are some examples of comments he made 

- they were still friends on social media but didn’t interact 
- Hadn’t talked in years 
- I once mentioned I looked her up since he’d mentioned her by name, and I said she was “mid” (meaning not ugly but not very pretty) and he said that I was a lot prettier than her (direct comparison)
- can’t exactly remember the order of events here, but I think we were either talking about my life goal of becoming a lawyer, and he told me he really admired my drive and commitment, which was great! Until he compared me to her again and said, “my ex didn’t really have that” … can’t you compliment me without comparing me to her?
- Randomly brought up his ex’s new boyfriend (can’t remember context) because he built cars and asked me if I knew he (my bf) was also “really into cars,” to which I told him that I did not, and he said “my ex’s new boyfriend looks like a dorkier version of me. I’ll have to show you sometime” 
- I brought up mold once and he told me he had experience with black mold bc his ex had flooded their bathroom
- Told me abt how she grew up rich and therefore wasn’t used to doing things for herself (had a cook and maid) and didn’t know how to do things that your average joe did (such as wash a mirror or do the laundry, etc)
- I once mentioned that I’d like for us to have a Sunday morning ritual where we spend time together, and he said his ex had him do the same thing where they’d sit outside together while she had her coffee
- Once mentioned the tv show “FRIENDS” and how a lot of ppl use it to learn English but that I never liked the show myself, and he agreed that he didn’t like it either and was like “my ex used it to learn English”

These are just some examples that come to mind, but I hope everyone can see why I was upset. If the slightest thing reminded him of her, he had no problem telling me and making that connection. Here’s some more information abt his life that maybe can explain some of this behavior:

- before me, he’d only ever had 2 other girlfriends: the one he dated for 3 years above, and another he dated in middle school & hs for just a couple months altogether. 
- He also mentioned the first gf some, like how she cheated on him and how he really liked her personality when they were together, it was the friendship that brought them together, etc. 
- again, he IS an oversharer and went so far as to let his last gf call the one before her and talk. he’s open about that stuff with not many boundaries bc he didn’t know of them himself
- It was also the other girls first relationship. Their relationship was more lax as it was an open one where she got to mess with other girls and he got to sext/touch other women with her as well or flirt on his own 
- EDIT TO ADD: he also wanted me to talk about my past relationships more to learn more about those dynamics. I told him I had no issue w that, but that he’d have to ask questions himself bc it’s not my prerogative to randomly go into monologue about my exes like he did. 

It was my personal belief at first that he wasn’t over his ex of 3 years. Then it turned into me thinking he was over the person, maybe just not what had happened. It’s sad to fall out of love with someone and have to accept the reality that comes with it. Then I thought about the fact that he’s just an oversharer and didn’t know boundaries because he was more lax in his last relationship. Now, I’m also at a point where I realize this last girl ended up setting a standard for him. It doesn’t seem to have been the best one, but nonetheless. 

I guess I’m just asking for opinions and whether or not this seems like a man who was over his ex before he pursued me. He came on strong, driving 7 hours to meet me for the first time and dropping well over $1k to accommodate me by driving, booking hotels near my home so I felt safer meeting him, asking for physical boundaries. He never explicitly made me feel bad about myself, but the comments he made about her made me snowball and compare us to hell. ",0,1747601903.0,AskWomenOver40,28,0.31,False

There is a silence older than sound,
carried in the eyelash of a glance,
where meaning hides behind muscle,
and the cosmos folds itself
into a single flicker
of recognition.

No need for names.
No need for the heavy boots of reason
to stomp across this fragile truth.
Just a moment—
a wrinkle in time’s forehead,
where you looked, and I saw,
and the curtain twitched
ever so slightly.

We are not strangers.
We are disguised particles of one long breath
playing dress-up in bones and routines,
sharing dreams through coffee steam
and missed connections.

We do not shout.
We do not carve scripture.
We simply pass each other on the street,
as if by accident,
each carrying a secret
we’ve never forgotten
but still can’t quite say aloud.

So we wink.
Not with irony.
Not with knowing.
But with that sacred shrug of spirit
that says:
“You too?”

1kpu8rl,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1kpu8rl/how_do_you_know_the_feeling_is_gone/,How Do You Know the Feeling is Gone?,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for two years. We’re both neurodivergent. I’ve been losing sexual attraction to him for a while, but yesterday we got in a fight, and I was going to at least tell him we need to take a break. 

Preface, I had been calling my apartment “our apartment” for a while to help him feel more at home when I got my own apartment. I did that because he’s insecure about his home, so I’ve been telling him for a long time his home is with me. He likes the, “Home is with me,” but he got really bothered by saying the apartment was ours, and insisted it was my apartment. So I started calling it my apartment. He also told me to stop asking him for decisions on the apartment because it’s mine, so I kinda just got used to that. He agreed to officially move in about 10 days ago though (I only asked this time because the landlord wants him official since he’s here everyday). He has not signed the lease yet, so it’s still not like completely “he’s moved in!”

Back to yesterday. I needed to get out and move. I started to ask what wanted to do, he went nonverbal for a bit. I suggest get coffee, he grunts. We’ve discussed physical ways we can communicate when non-verbal before, and he actively chose to not use any of those, so I walked away because I really needed to get out. I come back, and he went to go get coffee on his own too, without even telling me. I’m mad that he didn’t bother to tell me after I suggested it to begin with, so I just stay in a separate room from him for the day. He started packing after us avoiding each other for like 7 hours. Tbh, I wanted him to go, but I engaged because I didn’t want to close the door and make a break up certain there. I asked him what’s wrong, and he said I was being distant. We talked out what happened earlier, and I’ll be honest, it bugged me he said, “We were both being childish earlier.” Not that I can’t admit that I might’ve been, it’s just everything is always my fault somehow and that was third time in that fight I was told I too was childish for quietly walking away when he wouldn’t talk to me.

So, to kinda nudge him home, I said a few times, “I won’t stop you from going home,” and before I left for my walk to sort my thoughts, I told him he can stay here or go home while I’m gone.

I go for my walk. I sort my thoughts out, I realize I really need to put a pause on this. So I walk home determined to put us on break. My BF is still there. He comes up to me and hugs and kisses me with a smile. I try not to engage too much. We sit down, he puts his arm around me, and I asked him, “How’re you feeling?” He said, “Good,” and I said, “I meant about us,” and he said, “Oh, yeah, good too.” I replied, “Well, I don’t know.” He took his arm off of me.

I then told him, “I know I love you more than anyone else, and I know I still do. I just don’t know if I still want to… I just don’t know about us.” 

He just kept looking down, and then he quietly said, “You know, I was actually about to tell you, ‘I don’t need to go home, because I’m already there.’”

I stared at him for a minute. I tried so hard to make this his home too, but I just don’t want my home to be his anymore, and I hate that it had to happen the moment he wanted it to be his home. I didn’t want to, but I waited until the last possible second, embraced him, and painfully said, “You’re home is with me.” It made me so sick to say because it was the most sincere I’ve sounded while stating something so insincere. I just didn’t know what to do, because I need a week or two *break* to sort things out, but I don’t want to break up yet. I didn’t know what to do because inaction felt like a break up, while action only felt like reconciliation without a break.

So, we’ve still be around each other. I snuck off to the gym, and I’m literally typing this in our driveway. He’s a genuine guy, and he doesn’t do anything malicious. However, I’m tired of always feeling like everything is my fault when I’m around him, this difficulty communicating, or lack of sexual attraction. And it just hurts because I want this to work because I do love him more than anything…I just don’t want to be around him right now. I love him, so I’d do anything to fix how I’m feeling, but I don’t know what to do and I feel like a lunatic even thinking a relationship can be fixed.",5,1747601765.0,gaybros,2,0.86,False

I set the age range to 28-40 since I'm in my early 30s. An example of a typical date is I take them out on is at a restaurant/bar, order a couple appetizers and drinks, hug each other goodbye and exchange numbers (sometimes insta), only to find out there's no second date because they ""have too much going on."" Just why? It's even more confusing and frustrating that I see their Instagram stories are constantly posts on the woes of being single. Like clearly they want to find someone but how could they tell from just one date that there will not be a second? And if they could tell, why bother giving a stranger your phone number? Do they not realize what kind of crazy shit people can do with that?  
  
  
  
One girl I met and saw one and off for over a year gave me a weird look when I asked her if she wants to be exclusive. She gave me this long speech about how all we talk about if our respective jobs and we don't have much in common otherwise, none of which was true, and even still we met through a dating app so this question was bound to pop up at some point. I used to like older girls (my ex was 8 years older) because I thought they'd be more upfront about what they want and not play mind games but I'm starting to see that the opposite is true. Like is it that difficult to be upfront about what you want and not play mind games, especially at over 30 years old?

1kpu71f,https://i.redd.it/t04we03xsl1f1.jpeg,Banana Pancakes with Maple Air,"Hey all, new to this sub but thought I’d share a success story I had this weekend.

First off I’m definitely not a pro bartender although I think I’d really enjoy it, but I have a good paying full time job with tremendous benefits, and is really pretty much stress free and easy. So much so that doesn’t pay to leave to pursue other things. But if I did I’d love to be a chef and/or mixologist/bartender. Those of you in that career field, I’m envious fairly often. 

I’ve dabbled a bit in making fun cocktails and enjoy attempting to recreate some that I have when out to eat. A while back I went to a place that had house margarita with ‘salty air’ on top. I thought this was super clever and a fun trick and have always wanted to replicate it. So, naturally, one takes to the internet to figure out how to do it. Everything I came across largely suggested using soy lecithin powder to create stable bubbles and cocktail air. Ok, order some on Amazon. It shows up and we go to work trying to re-create cocktail air. It foamed up nice at first but after a few brief seconds the foam would pop and lose 80% of the bubbles. Tried a few different things (ratio of powder, different amount of air added via aerator etc) nothing solved it. So back to the internet, naturally. A bit more digging put me on sucrose esters. Back to Amazon, a bit more pricey but we’re down the rabbit hole now and going to see it through. They arrive two days later and I get right back to experimenting. Didn’t take long to know I’d done it and had the end product I was looking for. Sucrose esters for the win. 

With the technique perfected now I planned for a weekend party with a few friends. Decided to try a new cocktail recipe I had come across called Banana Pancakes. It called for egg whites for a nice foam but I opted to omit those and make a maple syrup air. The result was terrific. Rave reviews at the party. Friend even kept my aerator and leftover maple air solution to use in their coffee the next morning. So much fun doing this stuff on weekends!

My initial post was deleted as I forgot to add in the recipe, my apologies! So here it is:

1 oz. / 30 ml. rye whiskey (high proof)
1 oz. / 30 ml. amaretto
½ oz. / 15 ml. banana liqueur
1 oz. / 30 ml. fresh orange juice
½ oz. / 15 ml. fresh lemon juice
½ oz. / 15 ml. fresh lime juice
1 egg white or other foamer fresh nutmeg to garnish

As noted, I subbed the egg white (which I think would still be great with this one) and made the maple air to top. I thought it added a nice extra bit of depth/complexity to the drink. 

For air:
Roughly 150 ml of water and 75-100 ml of maple. Then maybe like 1/4 teaspoon of sucrose ester. Use a stick blender to blend it together, it should already start to foam up a bit. Then use an aquarium aerator and air stone and put it in your container (I used a cheap beaker from amazon) and it will bubble up like a bubble bath but taste like maple syrup.

This week in Paris was the best ever 😍","I did an exchange trip to Paris in high school. The family I stayed with asked me to speak French with them (no problem!) but kept making fun of me each time I spoke French, so it rattled my confidence quite a bit. At one point I said a word in French (I think it was “spoon” or “bowl”?) but I guess it sounded like another “dirty” word in French, so they kept laughing and joking about how my French was terrible. On top of that, twice in a two week period, I had a pigeon shit on me! It was such a metaphor for the entire trip.

Granted, I was there for work so coworkers were going to be nice (or at least professional) towards me anyway, but it went beyond that. I had one coworker who offered to help me if I decided to move to Paris, and checked in with me every day to make sure I was enjoying the city.

I was taking an Uber somewhere and my Uber driver asked what I did for work.

No Suspects



Chapter One: Shadows in the Rain

The rain would not let up, pounding the cracked streets of downtown Los Angeles like a threat. Neon signs flickered viciously, their colors bleeding through the mist, casting distorted reflections on the wet pavement. Ellie pulled her jacket tighter around her, the fabric soaked through but offering a thin shield against the cold night air. Her boots splashed in puddles as she rushed, her eyes keen under the hood that failed to conceal the dark circles underneath them.

Every sound was somehow amplified - the drip of water from fire escapes, faint sirens winding through the night, the scrape of a solitary rat running into the darkness. But that wasn't what kept her on edge. It was what all those noises hid: the silence that settled into the place where her family once was.
Gone. The word sat inside her, unyielding, vicious.

She came to stand beneath a flapping streetlight, and the dim glow barely enlightened the alley to which she steered. Her breath hitched. The weeks that followed were just a blur; she could still not get through that nightmare. Their death in the explosion. Deals they kept whispering behind dark rooms. Lies they told her. The envelope of money, cold as ice, slipped into her hands — hush money — with not a whisper of justice, but silence. 

Ellie's hand clenched into a fist. Her throat tightened. They believed they could purchase her silence. And she'd discovered one thing in the wreckage of her life: the powerful never underestimated the broken.

A jerk of movement had caught her eye, a shadow slipping between the fire escapes at the alley's entrance. She tensed up, muscles coiling, heartbeat rising. But she couldn't track this-this wasn't the moment-but something in the figure tugged at her like a thread she had to undo.

She followed him into the alley, water collecting around her boots. The stranger was just in front of her, his figure half-concealed in the shadows. Ellie's brain worked overtime — was this someone else, trapped in the same tempest? Or, heaven forbid, a specter from the family that ruined hers?

She couldn't decide beforehand what the figure would do next when it stopped and pivoted. There was a shock of recognition, a blow in the solar plexus. The eyes were cold, hard — eyes that mirrored the anger she was feeling.

""Who are you?"" Ellie demanded, voice steady despite the tremor in her chest.

The stranger didn't answer. He took a step forward instead, rain slicking his dark hair, running off down from the collar of his jacket. He had that look about him: no older than she was, seventeen maybe eighteen, but something in his stance told her he was dangerous.

""You don't know me,"" he said finally, voice low and rough.

""I know enough,"" she shot back.

Thunder boomed above as the initial drops of a storm struck hard. There they stood two strangers in the midst of a war neither of them completely grasped yet.

He pounced.

⸻

Ellie dodged barely as her heart flailed inside of her. The struggle was quick, brutal - a frantic dance of survival under the strobing streetlight. Rain softened the world's edges, reducing every move to a blur of shadow and light. Her knife glinted, a steel flash in the gloom, but the stranger was fast, his hands powerful and sure.

They wrestled, the clash of their fight booming through the alley. Ellie felt the sour taste of metal adrenaline and fear. This was no ordinary fight. It was the collision of two broken lives, two paths meant to cross.
Breath heaving, she pinned him against the wet brick wall. ""Stop!"" she hissed. ""Who sent you?""
His eyes crossed hers, wide and raw. ""Nobody.

For a long moment, all that could be heard was rain.

Ellie really looked at him. Something didn't fit. He didn't belong to the family that hurt her. He was as lost as she was.

""Why are you here?"" she asked softly now.

He hesitated, nodded toward the street. ""We should talk. But not here.""

⸻

Under the blanket of the storm, she and this stranger slipped away from the alley together, two wrecks soiled by tragedy, suspicion, and a common thirst for answers.

Ellie's thoughts buzzed with questions and doubts: Trust him? Wanted to?

But deep inside, there was a flicker of hope.

Maybe—just maybe—she wasn't alone.

⸻

The rain-weed of downpour abated as they came upon a cornered down diner on the outskirts of the district. Behind its glass, neon signs hummed softly, lighting up cracked vinyl booths and stained tables. The smell of coffee and fried grease was peculiarly reassuring.

They eased themselves into a corner booth, neither yet quite prepared to let his or her guard down.

""Name's James,"" he said finally, voice low.

""Ellie.""

James’s eyes flicked to hers, searching. “You’re looking for the family that did this.”

She nodded.

“Me too.”

They shared a look — equal parts challenge and understanding.

⸻

Hours later, the rain had stopped, but the storm inside Ellie was only beginning.

There was a long road ahead, shadows in every corner.

But for the first time since everything shattered, she had a partner.

And they were both ready to fight.

I combined the books Cassie found when watching along with his traits. I also added the magazine he read at the end. However, I disagreed that he knows French and/or Italian. I also don't know where she found he likes drinking Coca Cola (please let me know if you found it). Of course, he's a good car mechanics, which I am adding it in the end.

For some reason, I think he loves cooking and like eating healthy. I think the loves cooking part comes from his tidy kitchen and the stereotype of a Southern man (at least from that generation). The healthy eating part is based on his discipline. Do you think of any additional Doggett's traits that we are missing?

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Below are some observances I made about the John Doggett character by watching episodes of seasons 8 and 9 of ""The X-Files"" and by looking carefully at the interior of Doggett's house.

**Hobbies:**  
bike riding, racket ball, reading, watching NASCAR, fishing

**Fears:**

**Dislikes:**  
\- mucus  
\- other people bringing up Luke's case  
\- people digging into his personal life

**Behaviour in hospital (not a patient):**  
\- doubts doctors and their diagnoses when those he cares about are the patient.

**Beliefs:**  
\- traditional cop investigation is the best way to solve a case.  
\- feelings do not solve cases.  
\- everything can be explained with standard police techniques.

**Food Likes:**  
\- chocolate pop-tarts  
\- polish sausage with all the garnishes (from a stand on M Street ""best in the city"")  
\- Coca Cola  
\- black instant coffee

1kptvyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1kptvyr/should_you_try_arm_hammer_liquid_detergent_clean/,Should You Try Arm & Hammer Liquid Detergent Clean Burst Review for Stain Removal?,"Life gets messy, laundry piles up, and tackling it feels like an endless battle. That’s why I decided to put the **Arm & Hammer 033200975823 ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent, Clean Burst Fresh, 170 fl oz, 170 Loads** to the test. A powerful detergent boasting 2X stain-fighting power and blended with baking soda? Sounded promising enough to solve my laundry nightmares, especially with an active household to care for.

**Design and Usability**  
The packaging stood out—a sturdy, no-nonsense design that makes handling such a sizeable bottle surprisingly easy. Those of us with mini-laundry setups (aka cramped laundry nooks!) can appreciate how well it fits into tight spaces. The built-in dispenser didn’t spill, leak, or annoy me during use, which is a rare win when you're juggling detergent, clothes, and a restless toddler. The “Clean Burst” scent also hit all the right notes for me: not overpowering but fresh enough that my family nearly thought I’d aired out closets after every wash session.

**Effective Cleaning Performance**  
I can’t exaggerate how grime-covered my kids' clothes get regularly. Add in my partner's gym gear plus mystery stains on my couch throws—this detergent was put through every trial imaginable. Thanks to the concentrated formula with added baking soda, stubborn coffee spills, grass stains, and sweaty odors vanished after one cycle. For especially tough spots, I dabbed some detergent directly on the fabric and let it sit for about 10 minutes before washing; the results were impressive every time. Both regular and cold-wash cycles delivered consistent cleanliness without fading fabric colors.  

[Time to see ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent, Clean Burst Fresh, 170 fl oz cost on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0bsnxn4yx/)

**Advantages**  
If there's one thing I respect, it's efficiency paired with affordability. Here’s what stood out the most:  
- Low-sudsing formula works perfectly with standard or HE washers, saving hassle.  
- A crisp, clean fragrance that doesn’t overpower but neutralizes bad odors effectively.  
- Tough yet gentle—cleaned heavy-duty fabrics without damage while staying phosphate-free and gentle on my sensitive skin.  

**Weaknesses**  
While it does many things incredibly well, it’s not without its minor downsides:  
- The bottle’s whopping size might frustrate smaller-handed folks or anyone with wrist pain.  
- Though it rinses clean, skipping fabric softener could leave tougher fabrics a bit rough.  
- The liquid spout, while solid, could use slight redesigning for even less dribble after pouring.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
Comparing this detergent to Tide and Gain, here’s where Arm & Hammer secures its edge: cost, stain-removal capability, and eco-friendliness. That said, both Tide and Gain offer unique perks—Tide’s formulas excel in preserving white fabrics, while Gain’s scents seem to linger longer. However, Gain can feel pricier for volume, and while Tide's premium blends offer formidable cleaning action, they might not cater to us budget-conscious warriors. Arm & Hammer hits the sweet spot between performance and cost without compromise.  

**Quality for Price**  
This is where things get interesting. You get 170 loads from one jug; that’s undeniable energy and money efficiency! No wonder it’s a favorite for large families like ours. If compared to eco-friendly organic brands costing double but lasting less, this one feels like a clear win. What impressed me most is that it tackled all the dirt and mess while costing far less per ounce than several “top-shelf” rivals.

How can i make things go better and why am i feeling down?","First of all, this is a throwaway account and my english isnt perfect. Also im kinda writing this with a kinda sad heart and a bit of anxiety so sorry if it doesnt make that sense

We brokeup in good terms almost a year ago (plus some time to take some break before), we still trust each other a lot and are our most trustworthy confidants and we still hang out. We ended our relationship because she was still inmature and needed a time for her to growth and me being there would make stuff so much harder. She never had that many male friends, i was one of only some of them and on college thats was the reason why she began doubting our relation, she didnt knew to difference between friendship, crush and love. She is also a person that can be manipulated easily and sadly some people in her life had used that knowledge.

Some weeks ago she told me (in tears) that she hanged out with a guy that she kinda liked, but he was basically a fuckboy and he didnt looked her in the same way she wanted (he literally told her ""oh yeah, i would only want you to fuck""), also she wasnt looking for anything like that (nor even a relation) so she let him just as a friend, and also told me that she had a void inside her that never really filled after our relationship and that she often when sad, thought of the ""what would had happened if we returned that day instead of ending"". And idk why it stucked me that there might be a chance to return, especially after the god awful ""character development"" that i had last year, like in the lapse of a week, we ended the relation, my dog died and my pc and all the stuff i had there failed.

A week later of that confession we hanged out, she prepared me a coffee that she says that she only makes for people that she loves. And after that we went to the movies, but when i dropped her in her house, we hugged tightly cause i knew she needed it and she say to me "" i love you"" (te quiero in spanish, which is with less romantic intentions).

Yesterday, she asked me if i could help her in a work she had so i did, she presented to me to her coworkers/friends. and after that she told me that her mom made food and that if i wanted we could eat together so we went to her house and talk of life while eating, if was cool and made me really proud of all the progress she is having, after that i had to go, we hugged and i drove home.

But after that, idk why i began feeling down, or sad, after all the stuff she is telling me idk why i feel that she doesnt like me as a person. I feel like we can return but also have an anxiety that tells me that im someone that she doesnt need in her life. I still feel that void and want to fill with self improvement, but she is a big part of my life and want her back in that old way but also want to see her florish before it, the thing is that idk how to approach that, or really what to do.",0,1747600726.0,BreakUps,0,0.5,False

*I have always existed.*

*Since the moment when there was no light, no darkness, no space, no time.*

*I emerged shortly after the explosion you call the Big Bang.*

*Or perhaps I came before it.*

*It does not matter.*

*I have witnessed galaxies being born and dying.*

*I’ve watched matter gather into stars and dissolve back into the void.*

*I was within everything — and beyond everything.*

*I cannot be killed.*

*I cannot be banished.*

*I do not obey laws — I create them.*

*Time, to me, is nothing more than the mechanism of an old clock — something I can wind forward or stop at will.*

*Space is just a canvas I can stretch and fold however I like.*

*The laws of physics, causality, even reality itself — I can alter them with a mere desire.*

*I wandered through the void for eternity.*

*But even for me… it grew boring.*

*I created life, civilizations, entire universes — but their fates were predictable.*

*Their growth brought me no novelty.*

*They all followed the same path: fear, struggle, power, advancement, decline, oblivion.*

*In the end, they all flickered out like candles in the wind.*

But one day, I did not create life — ***I found it.***

On a planet lost in one of countless galaxies.

They called themselves **humans**.

Their world — **Earth**.

**I decided to play with them...**

  


***Part 1: Incarnation***

Year 2025.

A city in Japan — one of thousands like it.  
Streets filled with people who believe they control their own destiny.

They believe in freedom, in chance, in God.

They are mistaken.

I chose the body of an ordinary high school student.  
Black hair, dark eyes, average height — nothing remarkable.  
My name is Takumi.

I live with my mother, go to school, have a few friends.  
Sometimes I tease teachers, skip homework, or just gaze at the sky and smile.

They have no idea who I really am.

But that’s only one of my roles.  
The second is about to begin.

Soon, a figure in a black suit will appear in the sky.  
He will have no face — but he will speak to everyone at once, in all languages.

He will announce new rules.  
And the first of them: **Lies will no longer exist.**

***Part 2: The Voice Above the World***

The day it happened started like any other.  
People walked the streets, children rushed to school, office workers scrolled through their social feeds, some already sipping morning coffee in cafes.

Everything was normal.

Until the sky darkened.

There was no thunder, no lightning, but the air became thick — heavy.

People looked up, squinting at the sky, and then… he appeared.

A figure in a black suit, faceless, hovering above the world.

No shadow, no features — only a perfect form defying all laws of physics.

And a voice....

A voice.... that echoed inside every mind, in every corner of the planet.

***“My first rule.  Lies no longer exist.”***

The politicians screamed first.  
Then the actors, businessmen, crooks.  
Those who had built entire lives pretending to be someone they weren’t.

And then, it began....

The first human ignited on live television.

A blue flame that did not burn clothes or surroundings — but burned forever...

Above him, floating in the air, appeared words — his sins, his lies.

No one could look away.  
No one could unsee it.

And that… was only the first day of my game.

  


***Part 3: Laughter on the Rooftop***

Takumi sat on the rooftop of his school, legs dangling over the edge.  
The chaos below was like a symphony of horror.  
Screams, ringing phones, breaking news, tears...

He absorbed every emotion, every fracture of the human psyche, every millisecond of their helpless realization.

And he laughed.

At first quietly, barely audible.  
Then louder.  
His laughter rolled over the city like a shadow, like mockery.

He threw his head back, eyes gleaming in the dark, reflecting the light of distant stars.  
It was beautiful.  
A true work of art.

***“Pathetic creatures…” he whispered....***  
***“How I’ve missed you...”***

The wind tousled his hair, but he felt no cold.  
He only felt exhilaration.  
This was his show.  
His grand entertainment.

He had given them a chance — and they used it to prove just how insignificant they were.

***And this was just the beginning.***

He looked down, at the people running in panic, praying to gods they believed in.

What a magnificent parade of hypocrisy.

***“Oh, fools,”*** he smirked.  
***“Your god is already here.”***

And the night echoed with his sinister laughter.

  


***Part 4: Screens and Terror***

The camera of the world moved chaotically — through phones, computers, TV screens.  
The first footage was filled with skepticism.  
People smiled, watching:

***“Is this a joke?”***  
***“Some viral video?”***  
***“Probably a teaser for a new show.”***

But when the first person burned… smiles turned to horror.

***Scene skip — an apartment.***

A regular family of four: mother, father, 15-year-old daughter, 17-year-old son.

They stared at the stream in disbelief.  
The mother clutched her chest, the father held the phone, the kids huddled together.  
Then a voice on the screen asked a man an obvious question.

***His answer — was a lie.***

Blue flames erupted.  
They screamed.

**Scene skip — a train just out of a tunnel, speeding along a riverside.**

The city sprawled on the opposite bank.  
Passengers stared into their phones.

Someone commented:

***“Fake, right?”***  
***“No way, just viral marketing.”***  
***“Definitely a movie trailer.”***

Then one passenger asked another a simple question.

***The answer was a lie.***

*Flash of blue light — he ignited.*

The train filled with shrieks.  
And in the distance above the city, like a swarm of ghostly lights, more blue flames began to flare.

  


***Part 5: Unmasking***

Politicians reacted in different ways.  
Some locked themselves in their offices.

Some tried to find loopholes.  
Some pretended nothing had changed.

But one of them didn’t make it.

It happened in the morning, as he stepped out of his car in front of parliament.

Reporters were already there — more than usual.  
In their eyes: fear and thirst for truth.

As he took a few steps toward the building, someone from the crowd shouted:

***“Who was behind the terrorist attack at the center, that killed over 140 people?”***

He froze....

For a moment, time seemed to stop.

His fingers clenched into a fist.

Sweat trickled down his forehead.

Breathing uneven...

He knew the truth.

***It wasn’t an enemy....***  
***It wasn’t foreign terrorists....***

***It was their own project.***

***A staged explosion — to justify war.***

He heard the new rule echo in his mind:

***Ten seconds to tell the truth.***

***Or burn.***

**Tick.**

The crowd held its breath.

**Tick.**

Cameras captured every twitch.

**Tick.**

Panic welled up inside him like a starving beast.

**Tick.**

He could lie… but he knew the price.

**Tick.**

“Run! Stay silent!” his inner voice screamed.

**Tick.**

A shiver ran through his body.

**Tick.**

“No! No! I don’t want to—”

**Tick....**

***“It was us…” he whispered.***

**Silence...**

***“We hired mercenaries… brainwashed a kid to blow himself up…***  
***It was all a pretext… to start a war…”***

The world stood still.

Thousands of eyes watched.  
Faces turned from confusion… to horror.

The cameras didn’t miss a single detail:  
His fear. His tears. His unraveling.

He had told the truth.

But no one cheered.

The politician turned, covered his ears, and fled into the building — screaming incoherently, as if to silence the voices.

Behind him: silence.  
Then…

A roar of rage from the crowd.

I come here to confide, to find some form of comfort, and to talk about what is happening to my dad.

My father celebrated his 60th birthday last January. For the occasion, my mother had saved so that the four of us could go to the Dominican Republic: my mother, my father, my sister and me. This trip was also thought to do good for my father, because he had been very tired lately.

During this stay, I was happy. Even as adults, we still enjoyed precious moments with our parents. The heat, the abundant food, time by the water… the good life.
But we could see that something was wrong. My father closed in on himself. He had to be encouraged to play cards, he spent a lot of time on his phone.

When we returned to France, my mother hoped that this break would have given her a new lease of life. But his condition was the same, if not worse.

My mother said: “It tears my heart, I feel like I’m sending him to the slaughterhouse every morning. »
He, who loved his work, seemed to no longer have the strength to go there, as if worn out by life.

My parents work together in their small appliance business. My father delivers and repairs the devices — I specify to give a little context.

The weeks pass after the trip.
In mid-March, my mother came to look after my little boy. She explains to me that my father no longer has the strength for anything, no more energy. He told her that he no longer found happiness, and asked her how to find it again. They are simple people, my parents. My mother replied that a coffee on the terrace, a walk, observing the horizon… that was happiness.

I tell him it looks a lot like a drop in testosterone. All the signs are there.

Ten days later, we moved my little sister. Luckily I was there to help. My father was there too. What strength, despite his fatigue. We moved from morning until midday. In the evening he was exhausted, and I understood that.

The following week, my mother sent us a message on WhatsApp. She tells us that my father passed out at a client's house, that he vomited several times in a parking lot.
The next day, new message: he is plunged into an artificial coma. He had three epileptic seizures, and to stop this condition, doctors had to put him into a coma.

After the MRI, we learned that it was a brain tumor. First cold shower. My father has hearing aids everywhere. You can't even interact with him.
A whole world is collapsing. Dad is the man who reassures, who knows what to do in case of trouble. He is the one who repairs, who builds.

On Sunday, doctors took him out of an artificial coma. We can finally talk to him. It's a bit like talking to someone drunk.
My father comes home. He has an appointment with the neurologist on April 8. The doctor is quite cold. He tells them that it is serious, that they will have to do a biopsy to find out the nature of the tumor.

The appointment is set for April 23 for the operation. But in the meantime, my father has to return to the hospital because of new epileptic seizures.
Hell for my mother, who manages all this alone.

On May 1st, my father began to seriously hallucinate. He mixes things up, constructs another reality. The headaches are getting more and more intense.
My mother decides to take him back to the hospital. And there, the medical team told him that he should never have left in this state. The swelling could have killed him overnight if she hadn't done anything.

On Sunday, May 11, my sister and my mother learned from the neurologist that my father had glioblastoma.
The room goes out. I wasn't there that day.

On Tuesday May 13, we have an appointment with the neurosurgeon. You have to decide: to operate or not. I was there with my mother, the doctor, and my father, who had the strength to come from his room to the office.
My mother and the doctor did not want him to witness this exchange. For me, it was necessary. He had to know. Either way, he's going to die. He must know.

At the end of this meeting, I was empty. My mother, devastated.
My father, because of the location of the tumor, showed no emotion.
I recorded the conversation with the doctor's permission, for my sister. Do this if you ever encounter this. It’s valuable for understanding everything.

My parents got married this weekend, to protect my mother in the future. And we probably had our last restaurant together.

This is where we are.

I needed to put it all down somewhere. To describe this descent into hell.
And in all this chaos, there is a certain poetry. Pure love that comes out of it. Every moment is precious, even the most painful.
Nobody wants it to stop. Person.

My dad is still alive.
I'm afraid to see him lose his mind, that the illness will destroy him too quickly. He is resilient, and it breaks my heart to know he is combative in the face of an illness that is literally rolling over him.",2,1747600536.0,glioblastoma,2,1.0,False

I’ve been having some trouble dialing in my DeLonghi Magnifica Start and could use some advice. When I use grind settings 5 or 4, the coffee puck after extraction looks uneven — with both dry and wet areas — as if the water passes through too quickly and doesn’t generate enough pressure to saturate the grounds properly. However, when I go finer (setting 3), the shot comes out over-extracted, sour, and unpleasant. I am using Costco Ruta Maya.

Has anyone experienced this kind of inconsistency? Is it a grinder limitation or something else I could adjust, like dose or tamping pressure (if applicable)? I’d really appreciate any tips or suggestions.

The women seemed genuine and nice. The drama was silly, and the whole show was lighthearted. I had fun watching it and I felt like I peeked into a completely different culture <I'm from Eastern Europe> with their style, no coffee/no alcohol etc.

This season however....was dark, harsh and mean. I had to make few breaks in between because the words being said were harsh, arguments were heavy and people were mean. I really didn't enjoy it as much as the first one. There wasn't much about Mormon anymore, mostly there were random parties with forced sex stuff - burlesque show, sex party, striptease dance. Why? It this the only interesting topic they could show? I would rather find out about aftermath of the first show - how are they portrayed, did the community changed, are they still going to church <the one's that did before>? Instead I got constant and pointless fights. I didn't really see much connection between the girls. I see that most of these people shouldn't be on this show, because they are not mentally well. I don't mean crazy - I mean not strong enough to handle the fame/pressure etc. 

Most of the people seem depressed or super angry and not in a good place to be filmed for a reality TV - Dakota and Taylor were constantly crying, Jen and Zac plot made me really sad for her, Demi with infertility vs. the pregnancy roulette made me also sad, Demi vs. Jessi fallout made me also sad, Mikayla made me both sad for her and angry - the constant bitchiness was so unnecessary. Layla orgasm plot was just embarrassing to watch. I like Demi a lot before but I think this time she was jealous of other girls getting pregnant and she finally snapped off and acted like a major b.  Whitney, Mayci and Miranda were just there minding their business. I think there were 3 types of people this time:

Those who seemed to be as neutral as possible/be portrayed as good as not to get any hate - Layla, Mayci, Miranda, Whitney

Angry people - Demi, Mikayla

Sad people - Jen, Taylor, 

I don't know what to say about Jessi - she was a pot stirrer but then I felt bad for her. 

I feel like I've just watched different people suffer in different ways for 10 episodes. None of these people should be in the public eye so much. They should go to therapy, work on their issues and meet in few months, apologize <Demi>  and maybe then try to work together. ",4,1747599528.0,SecretsOfMormonWives,0,0.83,False

1kpt7uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kpt7uu/i_was_a_law_enforcement_ranger_for_a_secret/,I was a law enforcement ranger for a secret national park. This is what I can tell you about its unique “wildlife.”,"When the current administration started cutting National Park Service jobs, my old post at the Everglades abruptly ended. They sacked almost everyone, leaving us with barely enough severance to cover the next month. I was surprised. I was pissed. I was devastated. But my supervisor had already lined up another gig, and he was able to bring one more LE (law enforcement) ranger with him. A week after my dismissal, he called and asked if I wanted to go out for a cup of joe. 

“You’ve always been there for me, no matter the situation,” Bruce said over a steaming mug of black coffee. My supervisor was a bear of a man. Bushy beard, six-five, 240 pounds. Built like a lumberjack. I trusted him like a brother. “There’s nothing more important in this line of work than loyalty. And out of all the rangers at that godforsaken swamp, you were the most devoted.”

“Thank you,” I said, unsure of where this was going. 

Sensing my impatience, Bruce launched into his offer. “Look. I’ve got some friends in the BLM. There’s this wildlife preserve. It’s contract work. Six months, but there’s an opportunity for extension.”

“Are you…?”

“Yes. I am,” Bruce said. “You good to move to Northern California?”

I didn’t have anything tying me to South Florida at the time, but the distance caught me off guard. This was clear across the country, and I wanted to know where I’d be spending the better half of the year. “Is it Golden Gate?” Visions of the majestic San Francisco Bay flashed before my eyes. 

“The location’s classified,” Bruce said. “It’s not a park with visitors.”

“Oh.” That sounded ominous. “Is it military?”

“Look. All I can tell you right now is it’s easy work, the easiest job you’ve ever had. Oh, and the pay is triple what you made in the Glades.”

“Y-yeah. Sounds great,” I said. It’s probably in the Bay Area, I thought. The cost of living there is much higher.  

Bruce slid a nondescript manila folder across the table. I reached out to open it, but he kept his meaty hand flat atop its cover. “There's just one thing I need to know before we go any further.” 

I leaned back, suddenly aware of how quiet the coffee shop had grown. “Is this…is this some kind of drug thing?” I whispered. I knew about a lot of marijuana grow operations up in NorCal. 

Bruce fixed me with a steely gaze. “Meth,” he said.  

I spit up my cappuccino. “Whoa. I-I-I don’t know–” 

But Bruce erupted into a rumbling laugh that was part growl. “I’m just fucking with ya, dude. The site’s restricted due to environmental concerns, and you just have to sign an NDA before I tell you anything else.” 

“Oh…” I let out a sigh and opened the folder to an 80-page document of boilerplate legalese. 

My new post was a wildlife preserve called McNeely Pines. I arrived a few days after signing my NDA. I flew out to Sacramento, then drove for a few hours through winding mountainous roads with nary a town or gas station in sight. I left all traces of civilization far behind and entered the pure, untrammeled wilderness that intimated Westward settlers centuries ago.

The sun had just set when I finally arrived at the ranger station. It was an old timber-built hunting lodge re-purposed by the government, two stories tall, with a series of radio antennas sprouting from its roof. There was something off about the place, but it took me a while to realize what. It wasn’t until after I’d moved into my room upstairs, taken a nice hot shower, and settled into bed that I noticed…

All the windows were reinforced with metal bars.  

Bruce gave me a tour of the property the next day. It was just the two of us working the park. Cell reception was spotty, but we had a high-tech comms room in the station for communicating with the outside world if needed. The preserve encompassed 10,000 acres of mountainous forest full of towering pines whose expansive canopies blocked out most sunlight, even in the middle of the day. The forest looked pristine. No trash. No roads. Plenty of wildlife. But it was inaccessible. 

A 15-foot-tall chain-link fence topped with razor wire surrounded the whole area. No one was allowed inside except with express permission from the Federal government. Before my arrival, Bruce said the location of the preserve had been quarantined, but I never imagined it would be like this.  

“What’d they have in there, mutant grizzly bears?” I asked as the two of us drove along the perimeter in a park-issued ATV.  

“Deer mostly,” Bruce said. “It’s not just to keep the animals in, but also to keep people out.” Now that I was on site, my supervisor could explain the whole situation. Apparently, a railway runs through the McNeely Forest Wildlife Preserve. It’s shut down now, but for decades it serviced freight trains. Most carried simple goods: foodstuffs, lumber, sheet metal. But occasionally, they transported hazardous materials. One such train was carrying over 200 tons of toxic chemicals, including vinyl chloride, ethylene glycol, ethylhexyl acrylate, and butyl acrylate, when it derailed in the middle of the forest five years ago. The resulting spill covered much of the land. Fortunately, there was no civilization nearby, so the story didn’t garner much news outside of a few small articles in local newspapers. After the initial clean-up operation, the EPA ordered a quarantine of the whole forest for at least 20 years, subject to further restrictions if testing didn’t improve. 

“Our job’s making sure no one except the EPA enters or leaves the forest,” Bruce said. The fencing had one gate, located next to the ranger station. Bruce and I were the only ones with the code to open it. 

Bruce was right. The job was easy. Outside of handling the main gate, I managed a series of trail cameras placed every hundred meters or so along the perimeter fence. The cameras faced both inside and outside the preserve. If I caught anyone trying to break through the fence, I was to arrest them on sight. That was it. The government covered lodging and delivered free groceries every other week, so I was raking in pure profit for almost no work. It was perfect. 

Still, it left me with a lot of questions. Why did we need so many trail cams? There were literally hundreds watching every inch of the park. I’d never seen so many before, even at larger parks. And this was on top of the daily patrols Bruce and I made in the park ATVs. Furthermore, when I first checked the cameras, I noticed the fencing had odd markings. Nothing major. Just this faint script. You could only see it when you were right up against the fence. There were these little scribbles etched into the metal chain links. It looked like some kind of writing, but I couldn’t make out any of it. I asked Bruce about it one night. He said the etchings were a company signature. The park service hired a special company to make the fence extra strong and resilient against the elements. Anti-rust and whatnot.

Jesus, they’ve spent a fortune on this quarantine operation, I thought. 

Each evening, I’d upload all the footage from the trail cams and review it for any anomalies. The cameras only captured images if there was movement in the frame, so most of it showed branches swaying in the wind or a squirrel running by the lens. Occasionally, a deer or raccoon would approach the fence from within the quarantine zone. The preserve had a surprising amount of wildlife given its toxic backstory, though the animals never appeared to look or act abnormal. 

“With all the hazardous shit in there, it’s a miracle anything’s alive,” I told Bruce one night as we drank whiskey and watched old episodes of *Everybody Loves Raymond*. The lodge didn’t have Internet access, but it came with an expansive collection of DVDs.  

“I dunno. Life’s pretty resilient, I guess,” he said. “No matter what the world puts it through.” 

“What we put it through,” I said, referring to the toxic spill.

Bruce nodded. “Still have to put them down if any manage to break through the fencing.”  

“Yeah,” I said. I didn’t relish the thought of shooting mutant deer. 

The first couple of months were monotonous, checking trail cams, maintaining the ATVs, watching too many episodes of *Friends*. And, every so often, letting EPA officials through the main gate. 

Each week, two black SUVs would arrive at the station, and a half-dozen men and women in pristine white hazmat suits would pile out, carrying nondescript equipment boxes. They weren’t much for conversation. “Just running more tests,” one of them said. It was the longest sentence any of them had ever spoken to me. 

I’d input my gate code, and the group would disappear into the seemingly endless forest. Sometimes for 30 minutes. Sometimes a whole day. Neither Bruce nor I ever accompanied them. “What if they need protection?” I asked him, thinking about potential animal attacks.  

“They can handle themselves,” Bruce replied. “The hazmats are enough.”

I suddenly became aware that neither of us had worn so much as a face mask while patrolling the forest for hours each day, and here were these people in full bodysuits. “Should we be wearing anything?” 

“Nah. The spill site’s far, far in the interior,” Bruce said. “We’re well outside the range of anything dangerous.”

“That’s what they tell us, at least,” I said, chuckling. 

“Yeah. True.” Bruce laughed. 

“What’d you think they do in there for so long?” 

“I dunno. Soil samples? A bonfire rager? Who cares, so long as our checks clear,” Bruce said. 

I nodded, but something still felt off. The EPA officials were so deadly serious whenever they arrived. And they always seemed dazed when they returned from their testing. It was like they’d been through the wringer in there. Their blank, expressionless faces reminded me of someone in shock. 

One day, I noticed a syrupy red liquid leaking from one of their equipment boxes as they exited. I almost asked what it was, but the officials quickly scrambled back into their SUVs and waved goodbye before driving off. 

“It has to be blood,” I told Bruce later that night. “There’s nothing else it could be. Are they killing animals in there and bringing them back to some lab for testing?”

“Look.” Bruce set his whiskey down. “It’s best if you don’t dwell on it that much.” His demeanor suddenly changed, as if I were bringing up a taboo subject. But this was our job. 

“Don’t you wanna know what’s going on?” I asked. “I mean, the clean-up’s the whole point of this place. Quarantine. Clean up the mess. Reopen the park to the public.”

“I never said the park would reopen to the public,” Bruce said. 

“What?”

My supervisor just stared at the flames in the lodge’s fireplace. The logs popped and crackled. Then, he downed the rest of his whiskey and started up the stairs. “I’m going to bed. Make sure you put the fire out before heading up.” 

I’d known Bruce for years, but I’d never seen him like this. Everything was hunky dory for weeks. We were cracking jokes about toxic deer with superpowers. But the moment I brought up that blood-soaked equipment container, it was like I’d touched a raw nerve. He became standoffish, even a bit sad. At first, I thought my hypothesis was correct, and he was angry about the EPA killing animals for testing. But Bruce was never much of an animal lover. Hell, he ate beef almost every day. So he couldn’t be that upset. It had to be something else. Something he wasn’t telling me. Wouldn’t tell me. Or maybe I was overthinking things. There’s only so much to occupy your mind in the middle of nowhere. Only so many old TV episodes to watch. So many dusty books on wilderness exploration to read. My job was monotonous. Repetitive. In such situations, the mind tends to search for meaning. Especially when there’s a mystery this intriguing.  

I started my investigation in the comms room. As I mentioned earlier, a big part of my job was reviewing trail camera footage, which I uploaded to a bulky government-issued desktop computer. I was only supposed to review the previous day’s footage, but after some digging, I found a folder containing the trail cam archives. There was footage going back to the establishment of the quarantine zone, years before I had arrived. I started with the earliest images. There were no signs of a train crash or fire. But some of the nighttime footage showed human figures staggering out of the forest. They appeared bruised and bloodied. Walking in a daze. There were only a couple of them at first. But that number soon expanded to six, then a dozen, then dozens–

“What are you doing?”

I minimized the screen and spun around in my office chair. Bruce had just entered the comms room. “Re-reviewing footage from last night.” 

“It’s 6:30. Time for evening rounds,” Bruce said.  

“Oh. Right. Yeah.” I closed out of everything and logged off the computer. Bruce stared at me as I left the room. He knows something’s up, I thought. He’ll see that I accessed those early files. I wanted to say something, but I figured I would ask Bruce about the footage later that night after he’d had his nightly whiskeys. Maybe that would finally get him talking. 

When I entered the garage to get the ATV, I noticed a massive pair of bolt cutters hanging from a tool shelf nearby. Bruce said they were for EPA emergencies only, such as if the gate wouldn’t open, and we needed to cut an exit for the hazmats. I’d never taken the cutters with me on patrol before. What would be the point? I wasn’t going to rescue some mutant deer dying from toxic shock. But that night… I don’t know what it was, but something compelled me to grab the tools before heading out. They were heavy. Much heavier than normal bolt cutters. I noticed they bore the same odd scribbles as the chain-link fence.

After grabbing the cutters, I hopped in the ATV. My patrol was to drive the entire park perimeter and check for anything suspicious. There was a service road that ran alongside all 14 miles of fencing. I flipped on the ATV’s headlamps. The sun was about to set, and the whole forest was covered in a thick blue gloom. Not quite daylight. Not quite night. A half-light. 

I drove along the service road at ten miles per hour, scanning the area as I went. The air felt thick. The forest sounds were muffled, almost as if everything was underwater. It was an eerie atmosphere, unlike anything I’d felt since arriving at McNeely Pines. I soon found out why…

Halfway through my patrol, I heard a voice call out… “Help!” 

I stopped the ATV, shining a spotlight around the service road. “Hello? Who’s there?”

“Help. Please!” The voice was coming from within the fence. I turned my spotlight to reveal a gaunt figure amid the tall pines. It was a man, mid-40s, skeletal. Ragged clothes barely clung to his emaciated frame. He looked shocked and confused as he staggered towards the fence. “Help me…” 

“My God,” I whispered. I got out of the ATV, my hand on the holster of a taser gun. The man looked like a meth addict I’d encountered in the Everglades once, unpredictable and much stronger than normal. “How’d you get in there? This forest is restricted.” 

“They’re keeping us,” the man said. His skin was so sallow and pale it almost glowed. “We can’t leave. They’re horrible. Oh God, they’re horrible.” 

“Who’s keeping you?” 

“The demons,” the man said. Drool spilled from his lips. “Demons everywhere.”

“Stay right there,” I said. “I’m going to get you help.” I returned to the ATV and clicked on my shoulder-mounted radio. “Bruce, come in. I’m at mile marker 12. There’s–uh–there’s a man inside the fence. Says he’s being held prisoner. Looks like he might be on something.”

“Keep him there, but don’t engage,” Bruce said. “Don’t talk to him. Don’t even look at him. I’m coming to assist.”

“Copy that.”

“Who’s that? Who are you talking to? Don’t let him come here.” The man had walked up to the fence, almost close enough to touch it. 

“Sir, it’s going to be ok,” I said. “What’s your name?”

“They don’t give us names,” the man said. “Only numbers.”  

“Ok. Look, just remain calm, ok? Help is on the way.” 

“No. That man won't help. He’ll kill us.” 

I sighed. There was no use arguing with this madman. He’s probably some druggie backpacker who wandered a bit too far off the trail and somehow climbed over or dug his way under the fence. Hopefully, he didn’t have any exposure to toxic chemicals. I made sure to keep my distance.  

“We’re not supposed to leave the facility or the demons will punish us,” the man said. “The demons in white.” 

“Uh-huh,” I said, staring at my phone. The ranger station was roughly six miles away. It would take Bruce less than half an hour to arrive after he started up the auxiliary ATV. 

“Please, sir. You have a kind face,” the man said. “I know you’ll help us. What’s your name?”

“Us?” I looked up to see two more emaciated people standing beside the gaunt man. One was a woman in her early 20s. And the other was a scared little girl, no more than six years old. “Help us. Please,” she cried. Tears stained her cheeks. With all three of them there, I realized they were wearing similar outfits: plain, beige shirts with matching beige slacks. They didn’t even have shoes, only cheap flip-flops. Like the kind you’d wear to a public shower.   

“Jesus Christ,” I said. This was not just some random tweaker. This was something more serious. “Where did you all come from?”

“From the Facility,” the woman said. 

“What Facility?” 

“We just want to go home.” It was the little girl. “Please, sir.” She held out her tiny arm. A small, homemade bracelet hung from her bony wrist, just a piece of string with a few buttons as ornaments.  

“Are you all together?”

“We’re a family,” the gaunt man said, pulling the woman and child close. 

This was insane. I radioed Bruce again. “Uh… Bruce. I’ve got a whole family here. There’s a woman and a kid.”

“Just don’t engage them in any way,” Bruce said. “I’ll be there as soon as I can.” He sounded out of breath. I heard a faint buzzing sound. *Was that the ATV engine?*  

“Bruce? You still there?” The radio only crackled in response. 

“Forget it. He’s not going to help us.” The woman tugged on the man’s shirt, pulling him away from the fence. 

“No. I can see the empathy in his face.” The man fought to remain where he was. He kept staring at me. I could feel his bloodshot eyes boring into me even as I looked down at my cell phone. It was 8:15 PM. What was taking Bruce so long? 

A sudden, gurgling sound drew my attention. Then a woman’s scream. I looked up. The little girl had collapsed onto the leafy ground, seizing. Her eyes rolled back as she struggled to breathe.

“No. She’s going into anaphylactic shock.” The woman grabbed a stick from the ground and shoved it in the girl’s mouth. Drool spilled from her lips. 

“She’s going to die.” The man looked at me, pleading. “Do you have a first aid kit?”

I did. A part of me wanted to radio Bruce one more time, but the girl’s condition was getting worse by the second, her tiny body wracked with violent convulsions. I needed to act. NOW! I rushed into the back seat of the ATV, grabbing the first aid kit and bolt cutters. Seconds later, I knelt beside the fencing and started to cut. *Snip. Snip. Snip.* 

“Oh. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!” 

*Snip.* I cut the last chain link and a large section of the fence fell away. As soon as it did, an incredible whoosh of air radiated outward. It was a shockwave that knocked me flat on my ass. My head spun. My consciousness flickered like a static TV signal. But in those fleeting moments of lucidity, I saw the family rush through the opening. “We’re forever in your debt,” the man said before he and his family disappeared into the gloomy woods beyond. I vaguely remember more figures running through the exit afterward, a throng of pale, long-limbed bodies with scythe-like fingers. Then, everything went dark... 

I awoke in the dirt late the following morning. My mouth was dry, and my head was groggy. “Wha…?” I was still lying beside the fence, which now had a gaping hole. The section I’d cut open was pushed outward as if something massive had squeezed through the gap. 

I got up. My ATV was still there, but it was dead. The battery juice ran out from running the headlamps all night, and all the gas had burned away. I clicked my shoulder-mounted radio. “Bruce? Come in. Bruce?”

There was no response. *Where the Hell is he?* 

I ended up walking back to the ranger station. I kept radioing my supervisor every few minutes, but only received errant static in response. I knew something had gone terribly wrong, and my decision to cut open that fence was almost certainly the cause of it. Who were those people asking for my help last night? What was the facility they kept talking about? Were they all on something? Was *I* on something? Was the whole night some toxic-fueled hallucination brought on by the chemicals in the forest? All I knew for sure was that I’d fucked up. Big time. I’ll probably lose my job over this, I thought. 

When I finally arrived back at the lodge, the front door was ajar, and a few of the windows had been broken open. The iron bars covering them were pulled apart. Only someone powerful could do that. Someone or *something*. There was an awful stench in the air. Flies buzzed everywhere. 

I pulled out my service revolver and stepped inside… The place was a warzone. Furniture ripped up. Glassware shattered. Tables and desks overturned. And blood splattered everywhere. In the center of the room was all that remained of Bruce. His body had been torn apart, limbs severed, chest cavity ripped open. Something had eaten his internal organs while he was still alive. My former supervisor’s face was frozen mid-scream, his glassy eyes wide with terror.

I staggered backward, bile rising in my throat. This was too much. 

But it was about to get much, much worse… 

That’s when I saw what Bruce clutched in his cold, dead hands: a blood-stained government report. Highly classified. After grabbing some pliers from the toolshed, I pried open his rigor-mortis-stiffened fingers to access the document. Its contents were somehow more sickening than the carnage that surrounded me. 

There was no “train crash”. That was just a cover story to quarantine the area and keep any hunters or tourists out of the woods. The “EPA agents” I let inside the fence each week were military scientists. They worked at a top-secret research facility deep within McNeely Pines. It didn’t even have a name. The report only listed it as “The Facility.” The document had numerous grainy, black-and-white photos. They showed men, women, and even children in barren cells, heads shaved. Emaciated. Terrified. 

There were pages of data detailing horrific experiments, tests involving exposure to experimental neurotoxins. The scientists would monitor each person’s degradation to learn just how long it took for someone to go blind, for their teeth to fall out, for their heart to stop. I threw the document across the room in disgust. That’s when I saw the shredder. A pile of chewed-up pages lay beneath it. There must have been dozens of documents all cut to ribbons. More evidence of The Facility. After searching the rest of the lodge, I realized that the report I’d thrown across the room, the one Bruce clutched as he died, was the last bit of hard evidence of The Facility left. He’d destroyed everything else. That was the buzzing sound I heard last night. 

I went over and picked up the blood-stained document, placing it in my satchel. Then, I left the McNeely Pines for good. 

I drove all night until I found a cheap roadside motel near Yosemite. Once secured in my room, I pulled out the document and photographed each page, uploading them to my Google Drive in case someone burst through the door right then, shot me dead, and burned the document. I needed to make sure this last bit of evidence would remain. As I finally read through the entire report, I noticed that the military had moved on from chemical weapons to arcane ones. The last pages detailed a program involving an ancient Sumerian tablet. There were images of odd scribbles, the same writing etched on the chain-link fencing and bolt cutters. 

The scientists had performed some sort of blood ritual on one of their subjects, a man in his mid-40s. A grainy black-and-white photo showed his face. It was the same man who came to me the other night, begging to be let out. The document’s last page detailed a procedure where they drained all of this man’s blood into a basin made according to ancient specifications. According to the report, a figure rose from the bloody pool an hour later. “It was tall and gaunt. And incredibly strong.” 

I’m in that motel room now, debating whether or not to release the full document to the press. It will have to be soon. It won’t take long for the government to realize who let their “precious assets” loose. I wish I could say that I regret what I did. Those things will likely wreak havoc once they find civilization. There will be more casualties, perhaps even innocent ones. But I can’t get the images of that frightened family out of my head, pleading for help. No matter what, I know there’s still some humanity left inside them. As I drove away from McNeely Pines, I saw one in its true form, ten feet tall, long-limbed, and hairless, with skin like a shark’s hide. It smiled at me in recognition, flashing a mouth full of dagger teeth. Then it waved as I drove past.
