I've never tried embroidery before, but I found a small kit that would make a perfect gift for someone in my life and I had to get it. I've been wanting to try embroidery for a while, so I'm quite excited! I thought it might be fun to meet up with someone else who has a bit more experience than me in case I have questions or need a bit of guidance, maybe we can work on our projects together. In exchange I'm happy to buy you coffee, tea, other drinks, cake etc. in a cafe or bar where we meet up.

Just a bit about myself, I'm a woman in my early 40s from Canada who can speak English, Japanese or intermediate German (whichever you prefer), who loves trying new creative projects and am always happy to chat about artsy things or many other interests. I can hang out in mostly silence or chat a lot, I tend to match the energy of whoever I'm hanging out with. I also have a tiny and gentle senior dog who I'm happy to bring along with me if you love dogs, but she's also fine to stay at home and snooze if not. 

Feel free to message if you have questions or would like to meet up :) And have a lovely week either way!",2,1729591490.0,berlinsocialclub,0,1.0,False

There is this girl that I work with who I am very attracted to and I'm trying to guage if she is in to me or just friendly. We've been working together for 2 months now. It all started when I received a message on Facebook one night asking if I wanted her to bring me something from Starbucks the next day, I politely declined and didn't think anything of this. About a week later, she brought me a coffee to work without asking. I didn't think anything of this either but we work with multiple people and I'm the only person who she offered coffee to. Fast forward another week, she calls me and asks me if I want something from another place, didn't offer to anyone else. Plus receiving snapchats from her multiple times a day. Poking fun at me at times. Responding directly to me when I send group emails, typically in a non work relatedjoking manner. There are some days where she'll pretty much completely ignore me and it sends mixed signals. This girl has me confused af. Women what do you think? Am I looking too much into this? I've been out of the game for a while so I feel like I'm a child again trying to figure out women.

Good morning, Puerto Morelos! Today's forecast brings with it a mix of sun and rain, so be prepared for a bit of everything. As you step out for your morning stroll or grab your first cup of coffee, you can expect partly cloudy skies with a comfortable temperature of around 27¬∞C. It's the perfect weather to start your day feeling refreshed and energized.

However, as the day progresses, there is a chance of light rain showers in the afternoon. Don't let the rain dampen your spirits though! Embrace the opportunity to cozy up with a book, enjoy a leisurely lunch at one of the local restaurants, or simply take a siesta to the sound of raindrops outside. With temperatures hovering around 29¬∞C, it'll still feel warm and pleasant, even with the rain.

So, grab your umbrellas and raincoats if you're heading out later in the day, but remember, a little rain never hurt anybody!

1g9ehb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/powerpoint/comments/1g9ehb5/open_source_powerpoint_editor_with_an_ai/,Open Source PowerPoint Editor with an AI,"A week ago, I posted about a little (or should I say *lazy*) idea I had. You see, laziness is the mother of invention, and I‚Äôm her proud child. I bought an Envato license, downloaded a ton of PowerPoint templates (seriously, like tens of them), but then... well, the real enemy appeared‚Äîediting. Ugh, so much effort, right?

And that‚Äôs when it hit me‚Äî*what if I could write a script that did all the hard work for me?* Yes, I was on the verge of becoming the world‚Äôs laziest genius. All the AI tools out there were creating slides from scratch, and no major beautiful designs all boring like window XP. So, off I went, armed with Python and the OpenAI Library.  
Since I‚Äôm on a Mac, I immediately got tangled in a web of file permissions, processing issues, and all that jazz. I wanted to get context from a Word or text file to magically (or Pythonically) edit my PowerPoint for me. But instead, I got frustration on tap.

So naturally, I posted about my woes on Reddit. And guess what? Someone mentioned Macros! *Macros.* The thing I should have remembered but didn‚Äôt‚Äîkind of like forgetting your umbrella on the one day it actually rains.

I went back to the drawing board, scratched out ‚ÄúPython genius‚Äù and replaced it with ‚ÄúMacro wizard.‚Äù I revamped the entire process and came up with a new master plan:

1. Create a macro script to extract all the text from my PowerPoint slides, slide by slide.
2. Write said text into a CSV file, line by line, according to the first text on each slide.
3. Have a Python script that asks me for context (like, what am I even trying to say in these slides?).
4. Then, the Python script sends both the prompt and CSV content to OpenAI. It tells OpenAI to replace each line in the CSV with a similarly sized line based on the context.
5. Then creates a new CSV file with updated lines.
6. Finally, another macro to replaces the original PowerPoint text with the updated CSV lines.

In theory, this was supposed to be perfect. I even imagined myself kicking back, sipping coffee while the PowerPoint practically edited itself. Since the replacement text matched the original in length, I figured the layout and formatting would stay intact. *Or so I thought.*

And then reality hit me. Hard. I ran into some serious hiccups:

1. Sure, the lines were getting replaced, but they didn‚Äôt *flow* like a normal presentation would. OpenAI was just replacing each line separately, so each one made sense on its own but didn‚Äôt exactly play nice with the others.
2. Since I was sending each line one at a time, my token consumption went through the roof. (Though in my latest version, I made it a bit smarter‚Äîit now matches the word count exactly. It‚Äôs a step up, but we‚Äôre still not there yet).

So yeah, I‚Äôm at a crossroads. I have work piling up, and this little adventure is turning into more of a *time thief* than I expected. If anyone‚Äôs out there with ideas on how to smooth this out, make the script better, or just wants to share in my coding-induced frustration, hit me up. *Because at this rate, my PowerPoint is going to finish me before I finish it.*

My question is, should I just get her up for the day when she wakes? Or is it best to leave her in her crib until normal wake up time? She doesn‚Äôt cry, she just kind of sits up, snuggles her stuffy and puts that dang thumb in her mouth (another topic for another time‚Ä¶üòê.) 

I always get up at 4:30/5 so I can shower, enjoy one uninterrupted cup of coffee, and mentally prepare for my day.

Our DeLonghi has given up om us after a couple of years and we're in the market for an new espresso machine. Now, we're quite tired of having to replace them every two years, so what we are looking for is primarily a machine that will last a long time. Don't get me wrong, we care about the quality of the coffee, but to be honest none of us is an afficionado. So what we need is a semi-automatic machine that makes decent espresso and can skim milk and that won't break down the day the warranty expires.  And since we've had a not-so-brilliant experience with DeLonghi, we'd rather steer clear of that brand. Our budget is around $ 500.

I just checked the nutrition labels of the heavy cream and half and half in my refrigerator, and they are the same.

How does this make any sense at all?

The recipe for half and half is to mix equal volumes milk and heavy cream. So if heavy cream is 50 calories per tablespoon then half of that is 25 calories. And this is before you even add the milk. When you add the milk it should be even more. So how is it that half and half would have only 20 calories per tablespoon?",2,1729590072.0,Cooking,3,1.0,False

I just need to offload, I hope you don‚Äôt mind.

My career has been in shambles for nearly a decade now. I was pushed out of my company while dealing with cancer and was put on sick leave due to a legal ruling as my manager absolutely did the worst thing possible. (I had reported her for mobbing to HR, big mistake.) Since she had been in the company for several decades, her job was saved but I was told I could not come back. 

I recovered from that mess and went back out there and moved my family to be closer to my new job. Unfortunately, I was laid off after only one month due to the company being unexpectedly sold. I took the first job I could find and it was well paid and with an excellent company, but they started outsourcing all lower level jobs where a lot of that work eventually went to me. I was given assistant tasks that gradually got more insulting and I knew it was time to make a move when I was asked to prepare coffee and breakfast for more senior executives. 

By what felt like a miracle, I was head hunted into a contract role I had been trying to get for ages. Two months into the job, I had a major cycling accident and had to have a serious surgery with a long recovery that included learning how to walk again. I returned to the office as soon as I could, but my boss had given up on me and I went into the office for months with zero work to do. I was ignored when I asked for tasks and I was forced to wait out the days of my contract and I felt like an invalid. My manager assured me that I would still receive a positive reference letter, but I did not. It was so bad that I was advised by my unemployment counselor to hire a lawyer and take it to court. I did and I won - it turns out my boss made me a patsy for her faults. She ended up losing her job, but at this point I feel like my reputation in the industry is totally tarnished. 

I have been unemployed for 1.5 years now and haven‚Äôt even had one interview despite 100‚Äôs of applications. I have been told over and over that it is not me, that it is the worst time ever in the industry, but I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm hopeless. In the country I live in, nobody is hired outside their industry. I know my skills could easily translate, but nobody is willing to take the risk with my senior level. I‚Äôm happy to take a job that is lower level at this point, but nobody wants to hire me because they know I will leave the second I find a better job. I can‚Äôt even get a job selling retail or waiting tables because I‚Äôm not fluent in the local language and every role requires a ‚Äúprofessional certificate‚Äù prior to being hired. 

Meanwhile, my beloved husband‚Äôs lifelong depression and anxiety is finally taking a toll. I am worried he‚Äôs losing his mind and is experiencing false memories regularly. Will he still manage his high pressured career? Not to mention the black cloud that hangs over us constantly due to his depression. I‚Äôm constantly trying to hold our lives together and I feel like things are falling through the cracks.

I have no family but my father who I also support financially. He has had to resort to manual labor to survive and I know his body will soon give out on him and I have no idea how I can help him. (I live in Europe - he is in Texas)

My friends are lovely, but they all have young children and bigger priorities than my case of bad luck. (As they should)

I‚Äôve lost all control of my body during perimenopause despite maintaining a fit figure for all of my life. I can‚Äôt help but imagine the cancer returning when I see my swollen belly and breasts and I‚Äôm done with doctors who can‚Äôt take women‚Äôs concerns seriously and offer ridiculous dietary advice.

Anyway - I know that I am blessed and there are so many people who are suffering more than me. I have my dog and two cats and beautiful nature at my doorstep. I have food to eat, the ability to love and be loved in return and a beating heart‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm not sure what the intention is in my post, perhaps I just need to get these worries off my chest. Thanks to all who have read this far, it is quite a lot to ask. 

Will things just naturally get better someday? Will I look back on this time as an opportunity for growth or am I just rapidly falling into an abyss I will no longer be able to crawl out from?

Have a nice day ahead

It‚Äôs often the first thing people notice about you, and it‚Äôs a significant part of how you present yourself to the world. But what happens when you're not confident about your smile? Missing teeth, discoloration, misaligned or damaged teeth can all affect how you feel about yourself, and that's where modern dental services come in. Dental care is about more than just aesthetics; it's about improving your overall health, well-being, and confidence.

Let‚Äôs take a journey through the transformative world of dental services, and how they can help you achieve a smile that reflects the best version of yourself.

# 1. The Importance of Regular Dental Care

The foundation of every beautiful smile is regular dental care. Preventive dentistry plays a critical role in maintaining both oral and overall health. Routine check-ups allow a [**Dentist Coventry**](https://leamingtonroaddentalpractice.co.uk/) to identify potential issues before they become major problems. This might include cavities, gum disease, or early signs of more severe issues like oral cancer.

At the heart of preventive care is your relationship with your **dentist**. Developing a strong rapport with your dental professional allows for a more personalized treatment plan, tailored to your specific needs. Whether you need advice on oral hygiene, a deep cleaning, or a comprehensive dental plan, staying consistent with your check-ups ensures your teeth remain healthy for life.

# 2. Restoring Functionality: Dental Implants

For many people, tooth loss can be a traumatic experience. Whether it's due to decay, gum disease, or an accident, missing teeth can severely impact one's quality of life. Chewing becomes difficult, speech can be affected, and your confidence can take a hit. But the good news is, there‚Äôs a reliable, long-term solution to replace missing [**teeth‚Äîdental implants**](https://leamingtonroaddentalpractice.co.uk/dental-implants/).

**Dental implants** are titanium posts that act as artificial tooth roots. Once inserted into the jawbone, they provide a sturdy foundation for replacement teeth, such as crowns or dentures. What sets **dental implants** apart from other options is their durability and the fact that they closely mimic natural teeth in both look and function.

Implants are not just about aesthetics. They prevent bone loss in the jaw, which often occurs after tooth loss. Without a root structure, the bone deteriorates over time, leading to a sunken facial appearance. By opting for **dental implants**, you preserve the bone structure and restore the full function of your mouth, all while enjoying a natural, confident smile.

# 3. Aesthetic Enhancements: Cosmetic Dentistry

Cosmetic dentistry is not just for celebrities anymore. Thanks to advancements in technology and accessibility, everyone can enhance their smile with a variety of cosmetic dental treatments. Whether you're looking to brighten your teeth, correct imperfections, or achieve a total smile makeover, a **cosmetic dentist** can help you achieve your dream smile.

# Teeth Whitening

One of the simplest and most effective ways to improve your smile is through teeth whitening. Over time, teeth can become stained from coffee, tea, red wine, and other lifestyle factors. Professional teeth whitening treatments, as offered by a [**Cosmetic Dentist**](https://leamingtonroaddentalpractice.co.uk/treatmentcategory/cosmetic-dentistry/), are far more effective than over-the-counter products, providing a dramatic difference in just one visit. Brightening your teeth can take years off your appearance and boost your confidence.

# Veneers

For those with chipped, cracked, or slightly misaligned teeth, veneers are an excellent option. These thin porcelain or composite shells are custom-made to fit over your natural teeth, instantly improving their shape, size, and color. Veneers provide a solution for a variety of cosmetic concerns, offering a natural and long-lasting enhancement to your smile.

# Composite Bonding

If you have minor imperfections like gaps, chips, or cracks, composite bonding can provide a quick and affordable solution. The **cosmetic dentist** applies a tooth-colored resin to the affected area, shaping and polishing it to match your natural teeth. This non-invasive procedure can be done in one visit, providing instant results.

# 4. Orthodontics: Achieving a Straight Smile

Many people struggle with misaligned or crooked teeth. Not only can this affect your confidence, but it can also lead to oral health issues like difficulty cleaning between teeth, which increases the risk of cavities and gum disease. Orthodontic treatment offers a solution to this, and modern approaches have made it easier and more discreet than ever before.

# Invisalign

Traditional braces can be daunting for adults and teens alike. Thankfully, **cosmetic dentists** offer Invisalign‚Äîa clear, nearly invisible aligner system that gradually straightens your teeth. Invisalign offers the convenience of removable trays, so you can eat, drink, and clean your teeth without the hassle of wires or brackets.

The aligners are custom-made and replaced every few weeks to ensure that your teeth move comfortably into their desired positions. With Invisalign, you can achieve the smile you‚Äôve always wanted, without the embarrassment or discomfort often associated with traditional metal braces.

# 5. The Impact of Facial Aesthetics on Your Smile

A healthy, attractive smile isn‚Äôt just about teeth; it‚Äôs about the entire face. Facial aesthetics treatments have become a popular complement to cosmetic dental services, offering non-invasive options to enhance your overall appearance. Many dental practices now offer treatments such as anti-wrinkle injections and dermal fillers to provide a youthful, radiant look that complements your smile.

# Anti-Wrinkle Injections and Dermal Fillers

Wrinkles and sagging skin can make even the healthiest smile look tired. Anti-wrinkle injections, often known as Botox, help to smooth out fine lines and wrinkles, particularly around the eyes and forehead. Dermal fillers, on the other hand, are used to add volume to areas like the cheeks and lips, restoring a youthful, plump appearance. These treatments are quick, effective, and require no downtime.

Combining facial aesthetics with cosmetic dental treatments ensures that your entire appearance is rejuvenated, boosting your self-esteem and enhancing the impact of your smile.

# 6. Emergency Dental Services

Unfortunately, dental emergencies can happen when we least expect them. Whether it's a toothache, a knocked-out tooth, or a sudden swelling, immediate care is often necessary to prevent further damage. Seeking treatment from a **dentist** quickly is essential to managing pain and resolving the issue effectively.

Emergency dental care ensures that problems like abscesses, fractures, and infections are treated promptly. Your **dentist** can provide relief, prevent complications, and save your tooth in many cases. Having a reliable dental team that offers same-day appointments can make all the difference in a dental emergency.

# 7. The Psychological Benefits of a Healthy Smile

Beyond the obvious physical benefits, the psychological impact of a healthy smile cannot be understated. Smiling more often has been shown to reduce stress, improve mood, and even make you appear more approachable and confident. When you feel good about your teeth, you're more likely to smile freely, which has a ripple effect on your overall mental well-being and interactions with others.

1g9dpy4,https://i.redd.it/8chbs6efw9wd1.jpeg,Day 5 with Eric ,"Late update as I was working late last night 

We had another good day yesterday, I did some training with Eric touching all over his body, paws, nails etc and treating him after each touch. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs bothered at all about being touched as he‚Äôs well used to being handled already. But it won‚Äôt hurt to positivity reinforce it anyway and eventually he‚Äôll be visiting the groomers so tolerating his toes and nails being touched will prep him for that. We will slowly increase the pressure of the toe touched and nail wiggles over time.

He‚Äôs booked in the vets on Thursday for them to have a look at his cuts as they aren‚Äôt healing (he keeps licking and reopening them üò©). It‚Äôs also a ‚Äúget to know you‚Äù visit that they offer for new pets - they will fuss and treat him and try to make it a positive experience.

He has felt confident enough to do the stairs in the house a few times as well! This is great progress BUT he had an accident upstairs yesterday. I‚Äôd nipped up to get my jacket for work and he came up with me - as soon as he got into the bedroom he started weeing on the rug next to the bed! 
He hadn‚Äôt made any messes in the house for 4 days until this‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure if it was the excitement of a new area or if he hasn‚Äôt made the connection that upstairs is part of the no-mess area yet?

He‚Äôs doing better with food as well üòå still a pest and very much interested in what you‚Äôve got, but saying ‚Äúah ah‚Äù loudly and firmly is enough to deter him from cereal and coffee üòÇ we haven‚Äôt tried him around any higher value people food yet as he‚Äôs making really good progress with the rubbish stuff and establishing this as a baseline first will really help I think.

We have started using his kibble as a training tool as well - when it‚Äôs meal time we fill our pockets and he gets a small handful for eye contact and responding to his name once he is in a calm state. No food when he‚Äôs edgy and pestering. We‚Äôve been messing around with his food bowl too as he has a fixation with when it moves. So randomly picking it up, carrying it about and putting it down in places throughout the day. He still checks it every single time it‚Äôs been interacted with but there‚Äôs no elevation or excitement from him anymore - just interest. 

When I gave him yesterday mornings breakfast (as a whole meal as it was before we had started the other food training mentioned above), he even stopped eating it half way through to come and check in with me on the sofa before going back to finish it!

We both slept on the sofa downstairs last night and he slept like a rock.

We‚Äôre now wondering about how to stop him messing upstairs or if it‚Äôs even anything to worry about? 

We are definitely making progress but myself and my partner are bloody knackared! It‚Äôs the constant mental awareness that‚Äôs exhausting us I think - it‚Äôs so difficult to be constantly on the ball to reward him for positive behaviour üòÖ",2,1729587772.0,Greyhounds,0,1.0,False

[I(28f) think I messed up with my fiancee(27m)](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/131hhz6/i28f_think_i_messed_up_with_my_fiancee27m/)**, Posted April 28th, 2023.**

At first, I thought it was an overreaction, but after posting on Aita, I have come to realize that I may have messed up big time.

I overstepped my bounds. So my fiancee (27) cut off his mother when he left for college when he was 18. His mother was a teenage mom that gave birth to him when she was 17, but according to my fiance, she was not really there as a mother; she tended to prioritize her relationships with men, which put her and him in toxic situations at times.

Well, her mother recently reached out to me on Facebook, asked to meet up, and gave me her side of the story. She was a young mother who wasn't always aware of her resources, so she made mistakes. She was essentially a child raising a child, and she really wants to make up for those mistakes, but my fiancee never gives her the opportunity, so she was hoping I could convince him to just have a cup of coffee with her. I really felt a lot of empathy for her because, as my mom is also a teenage mom, although she made a lot of mistakes, she loves me, and I just can't imagine cutting her off. She couldn't have had it easy, so I invited her to my and my fiancee's apartments and waited for my fiancee to come home. I didn't want to blindside him, but when I mentioned his mother, he was not one to budge; he always thought the worst, so I felt like I needed to do it that way.

He came home, left after 5 minutes of back and forth, and when he came back the next day, he told me he was rethinking us getting married. We have been together for 6 years, and I am utterly in love with him. The thought of him leaving me makes me sick. How do I get him to forgive me and trust me again?

Update - So I know now that I have made a huge mistake. Me and my boyfriend had another conversation. And he told me he having a hard time getting past what i did but he think we should go to couples therapy to try and see my point of view because he cant just understand why i didn‚Äôt take his word for it, he thinks this way we can both understand each-others perspective and learn how to deal with it if we come across something like this when we get married. So we are pausing wedding plans for now but he still my fiancee. I have sent his mom a message to not contact me again and that i can‚Äôt be a middle man after that I blocked her. I know now the degree of my mistake and am going to do better in the future. I genuinely didn‚Äôt mean to undermine what he went through as a child.

**Relevant Comments:**

*YTA. You completely blindsided him. You knew he didn't want to see her. He comes home to her in his space and instantly feels betayed. You broke the trust. He should absolutely be questioning your relationship. This is a trashy thing to do to the person you ""love"".*

>Reflecting now, I feel like a total asshole and should have told him about the Facebook message, but I just wanted to hear about his childhood from another source especially before we get married, and hearing what she was telling me, it just really made me feel sympathy for her, and it just reminded me a lot of my childhood, and I just feel like going without contact should be a very rare thing. And knowing how sore a topic his mother is I just wanted to help him resolve it. I really do love him.

*Did your fianc√©‚Äôs mother even know his address before all this, or did you just reveal to her where he lives so she could pester him and grovel to him even when you‚Äôre not around since she now has his location? Do you even know what she actually wants from him? Maybe she became homeless or struggling, and is only reaching out to apologize and eventually ask for his financial help. It‚Äôs not your place to save her, him, or their relationship which stopped existing ages ago. What if one of his mom‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs assaulted him and he couldn‚Äôt talk about it to you?*

*Apologize and assure your partner you‚Äôd never make decisions involving him without his consent ever again.*

>She didn‚Äôt know our address before this but we are planning to move in a few months.

*It seems you have NO idea what trauma his mother put him through when he was a child and you thought it was a good idea to UNKNOWINGLY bring the very source of that trauma into his own home to confront him with it after he had repeatedly told you he wanted nothing to do with her.*

*I too would be rethinking my pending marriage to someone who did that to me. You have no idea how gut punchingly traumatic that may have been for him.*

*Your only hope is to fully admit to how much you fucked up and see where the cards fall from there. Anything less and you will be continuing to completely disrespect him and his boundaries and his wishes. And as a potential wife that is a disaster.*

*It will be up to him. Admit how badly you fucked up, tell him you want to make it up to him in whatever way you can, tell him you understand that his boundaries were violated and you have learned from this situation and will never do it again.*

*Holy fuck, I have a toxic brother I wish never to see again, and if after telling this to my partner they ambushed me like that it would be OVER!*

>I do have an idea of what his mom put him through, technically he was abused her SO while his mom was manipulated or unaware to the situations. My boyfriend told me that his mother never outright abused it was more on her partners and his mom told me she was manipulated and unaware of the situation and if she had known she would have done anything to protect her baby. I just thought that something my husband needed to hear instead of holding so much resent for is mom.

>Now thinking back I should not have ambushed him but he has known me for 6 years and i know he know I didn‚Äôt do this with badwill or intention, is this one mistake in the whole 6 years we having been dating (we were on for all years and have never dealt with infidelity, communication issues etc) really going end us getting married, erasing all those years of us being together over one mistake is just wild to me.. I really hope most of you are wrong and he gives me another chance?

[My(28f) fiancee(27m) wants to leave the relationship because of growing resentment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1524uzs/my28f_fiancee27m_wants_to_leave_the_relationship/)**, Posted July 18th, 2023.**

We broke up. Me and my fiancee tried to work it out, but his mom kept visiting us, kept waiting outside of our apartment, and it put a mental strain on my boyfriend. Our lease isn't over yet, so we couldn't leave, and my fiancee, well, i guess my ex-fiancee said anytime his mom visits, he can't help but feel an overwhelming resentment. He said it wasn't fair to me and him because he doesn't want us to be in relationship built on resentment. 6 years thrown through the drain. I guess you guys were right.....

I really don‚Äôt know how to move on, we were together for 6years. we have grown so much together apart of me cant really fathom a reality without him. is there anything aside from therapy (his already in therapy) to help him with the growing resentment or is it just over between us. We still plan to live together for 3 months. Please be nice am too embarrassed to talk to my friends about this.

td;lr - fiancee wants to leave me because of a mistake I made 3months ago.

Lamb Kofta - (5/5)
The Lamb Skewers were tender and not maanghit.  It tasted authentic paired with the two pita slices with its green sauce, tomato slaw, hummus and yogurt sauce. Have a bite and its heaven. I would order this next time!

Truffle Burger - (5/5)
The best burger of my life, better than Abaca's. It had a perfect balance of two protein sources; the beef patty and mushrooms that complimented the truffle flavor. The bun was so soft and chewy for a burger bun to be. The truffle fries with the dip is the best fries for me you can taste the truffle goodness - would order a big bowl of their fries because it is too good.

Cubano Sandwich - (3.5/5)
My mom said that the Cubano sandwich was okay but not worth ordering for the next visit. It tasted premier as it makes you feel like you are dining at a American deli. The side salad was refreshing even though it looks plain as the vegetables used were fresh.

Pumpkin Soup - (3.5/5)
This was a second option since they ran out of tomato soup and I find this the same as other restaurants serve pumpkin soup. It is delicious but I would go for the tomato soup rather. 

Seasalt Caramel Latte - (4/5)
I coined this coffee as the elevated version of all seasalt cream lattes. I find it somehow overwhelming but it tasted so refreshing. The caramel was not tad sweet to the extent that it paired well with the other elements (espresso, milk, and seasalt cream). Their americano and cafe latte tasted great as it will give you the cup of joe you need to jumpstart your day.

Location - (4/5)
I like how convenient it is but at the same time its quite hard for cab drivers to navigate on its own.

Service - (3/5)
Since I went on its second day, I do understand that service is quite sluggish. The waiters did their best and I root for them as they will improve and adjust in the next following weeks.

Willingness to come back - (5/5)
I would come back here always since the options to order are endless. I love their food and drinks spread.

Suicidal tendencies 

My(37f)  boyfriend (29m) had his leaving drinks with work colleagues last night straight after work. He has ADHD and so we send a lot of messages throughout the day every day. He messaged me at 6.18pm asking me a question and would have finished work sometime after 7pm. He didn't message again until this morning and way later than he wakes up when we'vebeen out drinking together. 
Am I unreasable in thinking just a message to say ""I've finished work and am off out now, have a good night"" and then a second message along the lines of ""I'm home now, had a great night. Speak tomorrow"" being bare minimum? Like that's all I wanted. I wasn't expecting chats throughout the evening. I would like to add in here that we are long distance and he has a history of attempting suicide when drunk. There has also been some strange behaviour around this work place (coffee shop). When he fist started he would invite me in when I dropped him off and I'd buy a drink and then go. But he's been really shady about it recently, nor even allowing me to drop him off in the car park let alone go buy a drink. 
We also had a big discussion recently about communication on my end. When I was at my friends house and didn't reply to him for a couple of hours he got upset with me and accused me of cheating. So this really feels like double standards and possibly projection? He thinks I'm being an arse and not wanting him to go out with his friends. Which is entirely untrue, I just want bare minimum communication. AITAH? ",5,1729586752.0,AITAH,16,0.73,False

1g9dh8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g9dh8t/do_i_keep_talking_to_him_or_walk_away/,Do I keep talking to him or walk away?,"I, (21F), am getting played by a guy (22M). To start off, in middle school I had a crush on this guy, let‚Äôs call him Ben, and he was a year older than me. I only saw him in the hallways and I never got the courage to talk to him or introduce myself. We went to different high schools but would compete in journalism events every weekend. He noticed me in the events and started asking around for my name and socials. Eventually, he got them and he started messaging me, but I had a boyfriend at the time so we would only talk and hangout as friends. When he graduated high school, he left out of state to go to college and we didn‚Äôt talk at all. Fast forward 3 or 4 years and he‚Äôs now back in my city. He recently reached out to me and asked me to hangout with him. I found it a bit strange because we hadn‚Äôt spoken in years and it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre strangers now, but I still went out with him. He asked me if I was still with my high school boyfriend and I said no we had ended 8 months ago and I asked him if he was in a relationship and he said no. Our first hangout was at a coffee shop and it was so awkward because ,once again, he was a stranger. As we started learning more and catching up on each other, I started realizing we have absolutely nothing in common. It was difficult to hold a conversation for the both of us but we still decided to go out more times. The 2nd time we hung out we went to see a movie and the conversations were awkward and I truly feel like we will have 0 connection. As he was dropping me off home, he pulled into my driveway and saw he was getting a phone call. It wasn‚Äôt a saved contact but he recognized the number cause he told me ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs my friend she always calls me when she‚Äôs drunk‚Äù. He left the phone ringing, I‚Äôm assuming he was going to answer it when I left the car. The next day he came over to my house and we were watching tv and things escalated and we ended up making out and getting undressed. Every 3 minutes he would do this thing where he would stop kissing me and just stare at me and smile. He would say things like ‚Äúsorry it‚Äôs just cause you‚Äôre so pretty, I can‚Äôt help but stare at you‚Äù and then continue kissing me. I found that very awkward but kept going. We were doing this for about an hour and during that whole hour, he could not get hard. I told him it‚Äôs okay we could just stop, we didn‚Äôt have to do anything, but he insisted that we kept going and he told me ‚Äúthis usually happens the first time I‚Äôm with a new woman‚Äù so we kept trying, but nothing happened. I eventually had to do something so we went out separate ways. He went to a bar with his friend while I ran my errand and at 2am he called me asking if he can come over again. I told him no, it was late and he should go home. Two days later, I met up with my friend and told her about him. She told me that he‚Äôs seen that guy with 4 different girls in the span of 2 weeks at the same coffee shop that she works at. She also told me that he went out with a guy to see a movie and he tried holding his hand but the other guy didn‚Äôt let him. Ben denies that he ever tried to hold the guy‚Äôs hand. So I‚Äôm getting played by Ben and he‚Äôs playing 4 other girls, maybe even more, who knows. He‚Äôs still texting me and asking me to go out to hangout with him, but I keep canceling. We have plans to go to a Halloween party this Saturday and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I got emotionally invested to this guy and I had this idea of him in my head because he was my middle school crush, but he‚Äôs just an a-hole and I hate the person he truly is. I don‚Äôt want to let him go because I am emotionally invested but I don‚Äôt think this is good for my mental health. He doesn‚Äôt even know that I know about everything.

I've kinda always known my brain was a bit ""wonky"", so the diagnosis was not a surprise in itself. This also made sure that I have absolutely no problem taking meds. Thus far, taking methylphenidate (10mg) has been amazing, it is so stupid how much energy I am saving now that my executive disfunction and ability to process and regulate stimuli are way better.

However, my psychiatrist¬†wants me to first try only four days of meds per week for a while, so we can work out what the proper dose would be for me. It's kinda lame as I have lived for 26 years like this, but my god I am struggling that remainder day at work. I need to read some scientific papers and do some writing today, but I have like a very aggressive ADHD day so it's just not happening. Does anyone have some useful tips I can apply to mitigate the chaos in my brain a bit?

I (28) was a muslim for 26 years but I decided to convert myself to the Christianity.

However, haven't baptized yet. 

My question is:

How can i protect my family and myself from demons and jinns (evil spirits)? Even though i warn my mother stop looking fortune, she is not listening to me. She think this is for enjoy but she doesnt realize that these behaviours open communication between humans and evil spirits. I was looking coffee fortune telling before i converting Christianity. My biggest fear that bad things coming from these spirits. 

Unfortunately i dont know how to pray. I just make orthodox cross (body gesture) myself when i feel afraid and saying some local prays. When i feel sad, always open some orthodox chats to feel comfortable myself.

The guy who owned the car was pretty chill and charged very reasonable rates. Drove off straight to our resort, which again had amazing staff and great food, even the north India veg items like paneer and everything were so tasty and light that we could eat it everyday.

 People in general are good and respond to your general queries, they (cars) also give pedestrians way to cross the road (hardly seen in North India). The restaurants are very reasonably priced and serve amazing food. When the whole world is going crazy about coffee, you should try tea in any restaurant in Goa and you are going to love it, the tea there is amazing.

Beaches are amazing, I was in North Goa, covered every beach till Querim, except Baga and Calangute as i heard that they get pretty crowded. The hills, the greenery give a different vibe altogether. I personally liked Chapora fort better than Aguada fort, chapora actually looks like a fort! I wish the roads were a bit better though.

Bought Cashews from Zantye's as i wanted to taste the Goan cashews, a bit pricey but the taste was different and their Kaju Katli is really good. It was sad to see the whole market now being dominated by marvadi and Gujarati community. Also tried a few beers, loved the eight finger eddy and the people's lager!

Ordered: Liverpool 24/25 third jersey, Kids' Liverpool 24/25 away jersey and shorts, and an adult Liverpool 24/25 goalkeeper top.

**Liverpool 24/25 Third Jersey**  
Ordered two sizes up, which seems to be a trend with Nike, and it fits well. The quality is good, but I'm unsure about the colours of the swoosh and Liverbird. It's difficult to see in the image, but they're more of a bright pink rather than red. I initially thought this might be how they were supposed to look, but after visiting a popular UK sports store (the one that sells oversized coffee mugs), it's clear the correct colour should be red, not pink. 6/10 due to the colour differences.

**Kids' Liverpool 24/25 Away Kit**  
The design looks pretty accurate, and the jersey seems decent quality. However, there's an issue with the stitching around the neck. I've contacted JJSPORT and am waiting for their response. The shorts aren't branded on the inside, and there are probably more loose threads than attached ones. That said, you wouldn‚Äôt notice unless you were specifically looking for it. 5/10 for now, due to the defect and poor stitching on the shorts.

**Liverpool 24/25 Goalkeeper Top (not pictured)**  
Bought this for a mate, which is why there are no pictures. It's probably the best of the lot. I went two sizes up again, and it fits well, with decent quality. 9/10

**Overall**, it took much longer than usual to receive the items, and communication from the seller was pretty poor. Some sort of quality control would have likely caught the defect in the kids' kit, but this doesn‚Äôt seem to be something they offer. As I said, I‚Äôve messaged them about the defect but don‚Äôt expect much of a response. I‚Äôll update this post if and when I hear back!",1,1729585777.0,Soccer00,1,1.0,False

1g9d6f4,https://www.reddit.com/r/howtoworkonlinenow/comments/1g9d6f4/why_is_the_remote_work_option_declining_for_big/,Why Is the Remote Work Option Declining for Big Businesses?,"In recent years, **remote work** has transformed the way companies operate globally. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this shift, making remote work not just a luxury but a necessity for many businesses. However, as the world gradually returns to normalcy, we are witnessing a growing trend of **big businesses reducing or completely eliminating remote work options**. Why is this happening? Several reasons contribute to the decline of remote work among larger corporations, and understanding these factors will shed light on the evolving work landscape.

# 1. The Push for Increased Productivity

Many corporations have voiced concerns about **productivity levels** in a remote work environment. While some employees have reported an increase in their personal productivity while working from home, leaders of large organizations often cite issues such as:

* Lack of **in-person collaboration**: Creativity and problem-solving are often seen as more effective when teams can collaborate face-to-face.
* Difficulties in **maintaining accountability**: Monitoring the performance and productivity of remote employees has proven challenging for some businesses. There is a belief that in-office supervision leads to more structured and consistent work output.

Big companies often work with complex hierarchies and extensive collaborative processes. For these businesses, productivity is not measured merely by individual output but by the overall effectiveness of large teams working in unison. As such, some executives believe that returning to the office can foster a more **efficient working environment** by reinstating in-person supervision, fostering spontaneous discussions, and encouraging deeper team collaboration.

# 2. Culture and Team Cohesion

**Corporate culture** plays a pivotal role in how businesses function, and remote work is seen by some executives as a threat to building and maintaining that culture. For large companies, having employees physically together can be a crucial part of:

* **Fostering camaraderie**: The shared experiences in an office, from casual coffee breaks to team lunches, contribute to the overall culture and cohesion of a team.
* **Onboarding new employees**: Training and integrating new hires into the company culture can be more challenging in a virtual environment. Face-to-face mentoring and guidance help new team members absorb the company's values, mission, and goals faster.

Leaders argue that physical presence in the workplace strengthens team dynamics, boosts **morale**, and reinforces a collective company identity. This is especially important in industries where collaboration, mentorship, and teamwork are essential to driving success.

# 3. Concerns Over Data Security

Data security is one of the top reasons why large organizations have been hesitant or have rolled back their remote work policies. The increase in **cybersecurity threats** during the pandemic made remote work more vulnerable to attacks. Some of the specific concerns include:

* **Lack of control over employees‚Äô personal devices**: Employees working from home might use personal computers or unprotected networks, increasing the risk of data breaches.
* **Weak network security**: Corporate networks are more secure and constantly monitored, whereas home Wi-Fi systems may not have the same level of protection.
* **Data compliance regulations**: Some industries, such as finance and healthcare, are bound by strict regulations around data handling and storage. Ensuring compliance in a remote setting has proven to be a challenge for many businesses.

Big businesses, especially in industries like **banking**, **legal services**, and **healthcare**, prioritize securing sensitive data. This concern has driven many organizations to prefer a centralized office environment where they have more control over security protocols.

# 4. Real Estate Investments and Utilization

For many large companies, their physical office spaces represent significant financial investments. Many have long-term leases on expensive office buildings or own substantial real estate portfolios. With remote work, these costly spaces sit unused, representing a sunk cost. As companies move past the pandemic, the pressure to utilize these office spaces has risen.

**Commercial real estate** also factors into the decision to return to in-person work:

* Large corporations often invest heavily in their **corporate headquarters** to reflect their brand, culture, and values. Bringing employees back to the office helps justify these expenditures.
* **Urban centers** benefit economically from the presence of large companies and their employees. A significant drop in the daily influx of workers into cities leads to reduced business for local establishments, contributing to pressure from stakeholders to return to normal office operations.

As a result, many big businesses view a return to in-person work as a necessary step to justify their real estate investments and maintain their **corporate infrastructure**.

# 5. Employee Oversight and Management Concerns

For many large businesses, **employee oversight** is a significant factor in their decision to reduce remote work options. Managing a large and diverse workforce remotely can lead to challenges, such as:

* Difficulty in assessing employee **engagement** and **well-being**.
* **Performance management** systems designed for in-person operations are not always easily adaptable to remote work settings.
* Some companies are concerned about ""quiet quitting,"" where employees perform the bare minimum when they feel disconnected from their colleagues and supervisors.

With in-office work, managers have a more hands-on approach to supervising their teams. This allows them to address issues of **engagement**, **productivity**, and **employee development** in real-time.

# 6. The Hybrid Work Compromise

While some large companies have eliminated remote work options entirely, others have adopted a **hybrid work model**, allowing employees to split their time between the office and home. This approach tries to balance the benefits of remote work with the perceived advantages of in-person collaboration.

Hybrid models are often seen as a **compromise**, offering flexibility for employees while maintaining the structure and oversight that employers desire. It is a solution that aims to bridge the gap between the remote work trend and the traditional office culture.

# 7. Client Expectations and Competitive Pressures

In certain industries, clients expect their service providers to have a visible, professional presence in an office environment. For businesses like **consulting**, **financial services**, and **legal firms**, being able to host clients in a professional office setting or meet face-to-face is an important part of building trust and delivering services. Furthermore, competitors who maintain an in-office presence may gain an edge by showcasing their team‚Äôs professionalism and availability for in-person engagements.

As competition grows fiercer, many big businesses feel the pressure to retain their **competitive advantage** by resuming in-office operations. The visibility of a bustling office environment can serve as a sign of stability and commitment to high-quality service, which resonates with clients who prefer traditional work setups.

# Conclusion

The decline of remote work options for big businesses is driven by a combination of factors: concerns over productivity, data security, corporate culture, and real estate investments, among others. While remote work remains a popular choice for many employees, larger corporations are increasingly favoring in-office or hybrid work models to align with their operational needs and long-term strategies. This shift is not necessarily an indictment of remote work‚Äôs effectiveness, but rather a reflection of the **complex demands** that big businesses face.",1,1729585330.0,howtoworkonlinenow,0,1.0,False

1g9d5co,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g9d5co,A fun little accomplishment I wish to share.,"Found a Nespresso Citiz at a second hand store for $1. Sign mentioned it didn‚Äôt work and being the person I am, I wanted to see if I could fix it. At the end of the day, $1 and some of my time isn‚Äôt a huge loss.

Luckily, it turned on without any issues. It did push water through once, then stopped and began leaking from the bottom. I instantly thought it‚Äôd be due to blockage and needed some descaling. 

Pushed some descaling solution into the machine (not recommended unless necessary if anyone else tries this) but it did no difference.

Picked the whole machine into parts. Found two large blockages which was easily removed as I could detach the tubes and internal parts. 

I also found a crack in the silicone vacuum tube, which I managed to find a replacement for, cost me $5. 

Cleaned the whole thing up - dish soap and desinfectants on plastic parts and isopropanol on internal electronics.

So I am now a proud owner of a Nespresso Citiz for $6 and have a nice addition to my coffee lineup. ",2,1729585192.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

I realize this venture of mine is pretty new, but when you believe in something, you jump in with both feet, right?!

I just went and looked at the cuuuuutest little building in town.  It's on the corner of main  street and 7th Avenue, so the location is perfect! (Visible to traffic headed up north AND commuters headed east)  The is cute as a button: rustic with whitewashed wood on the ceiling & warm, rich wide plank wooden walls.  üòç

To do this, I'd really be putting everything on  the line.  Good bye Sunday evening boat rides.  My husband will have to sell his beloved UTV.  We'll have to cash out his retirement, and REALLY cut back at home.  No more Friday night date-night dinners at J's favorite steakhouse and poor Armor & Liberty will have to sacrifice their happy meals.  I guess the upside to that is no more stray french fries in my car & no more fights over silly plastic toys.  Maybe this will be a positive change for the Boone family.  

Oh, but the most cruel cutbof all:  no more morning pick-me-up hazelnut caramel iced lattes from the local coffee shop.  I suppose if I'm not stopping in for coffe, my morning souffl√© and croissant are getting the ax, too. üò≠  Pray for me, I'll need all the help I can get!

It's a gamble, for sure, but when I really stop and think about it, there's litterally NO WAY we can lose!  I'm offering a unique product, no one in our rural town sells anything remotely similar...plus, my online sales have been pretty good.  I imagine business will only pick up when I open a very visible brick-and-mortar (plank & paint? üòÑ) store front!  

I've got a lot of figuring to do to see if I can make this happen or not.   What do you think, folks?  

I've gotta go crunch the numbers.  Keep your fingers and toes crossed for us! üòÅ",2,1729584820.0,thoughtsfromtheattic,0,1.0,False

May be, this is partly my fault. I never knew how a start-up environment will feel like. On day 1, people tried to talk and even took me for coffee with them. It felt awkward because before this I've worked in proper corporate environment which was way different than this. However, I was looking forward to knowing my coworkers better and working towards something important.



However, it's my 4th day today and I've nothing to work on. The team is small (around 20 people) but everyone seems to have something going on while I sit around whiling away. 



I even asked the manager but she just handed me few videos to keep me occupied on the 2nd day. Now the videos are also completed and I have essentially nothing to do. Tried asking her again and she didn't answer me directly. Instead, one of the seniors asked her to get me into some stuff that I didn't understand.



On top of all this, she texted me at 9 pm yesterday on the app (the company has an internal app for communication). I didn't see it and responded to her this morning. She just replied she'll talk in the office and until now no talks and no work as well.



All my coworkers are at lunch rn. I go late because I feel too out-of-place and awkward. And all day, they all keep talking and sharing snacks and I just stay mum or smile because I don't know how to insert myself into this environment.



I've made such a huge mistake of moving to an entirely different place for this job. Maybe, I just don't belong in a startup. I might be one of those ""cog in the wheel"" kinda corporate people.",37,1729584768.0,TwoXIndia,17,0.85,False
1g9d1r7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g9d1r7/does_minimal_texting_between_initial_dates/,"Does minimal texting between initial dates suggest a lack of interest, even if in-person it seems great?","I (31M) have been on 1.5 dates with a girl (25).  The first time we met was a very last minute thing to grab coffee for an hour before I had to go to a university class - so it wasn't really a ""full"" date. Before meeting we'd chatted briefly on Hinge and I didn't necessarily have huge expectations one way or the other - we'd talked so little that it really felt like going in blind. To my surprise the date seemed to go extremely well. I thought she was very attractive, funny and intelligent, and it felt like our conversation flowed really well, and that we'd grown up with similar sorts of backgrounds/values. 

I messaged her a while afterwards offering her my number and saying I'd like to see her again. She texted me about 4 or 5 hours later. I responded, thinking it would be the start of a text conversation, but she didn't reply that day. The next day I asked her out to dinner. She didn't reply until the evening - she apologised saying she'd been wrapped up in uni work, but said yes to dinner. Between then and the night of the dinner the texting was fairly minimal. She texted me once unprompted, we exchanged a few replies and then she stopped answering.  

The dinner date, again, seemed to go really well. We even (contrary to my expectations) went back to hers and were intimate for a while, until her roommate came home and she introduced me to her. She seemed to be very physically into me and when we said goodbye for the night I felt certain that she was interested.

It's now been two days. I texted her the following evening suggesting another date. She said her sister is visiting her for the next week so could we raincheck until the weekend following. I said yes and asked her some generic question, hoping again it would be the start of a text conversation, but she hasn't replied.

I guess my question is - is it possible she is interested in me, even if she doesn't seem to want to text much? Is that a thing? She's doing a PHD and has a very full life so I understand she isn't sitting around on her phone all the time, and equally that we've barely met, and I'm not expecting her to feel as I do, but I'm worried that maybe she was just after something quick and casual and doesn't particularly want to date me. Again - it felt like we had great chemistry in person, but now I'm second guessing and thinking what if she's just a good talker and can have those types of conversations with anyone.
