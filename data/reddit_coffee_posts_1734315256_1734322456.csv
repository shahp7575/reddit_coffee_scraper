I’m a 37-year-old Midwestern guy, 5’11”, fit, and I’ve been told I’m easy on the eyes—but I’ll let you decide. I’m all about humor, adventure, and living life with purpose.

After serving in the military, I’ve worked hard to build a stable, fulfilling, and secure life. Now, I’m ready to settle down, get married, and start a family to share all the joys (and occasional chaos) that come with it.

I don’t smoke or do drugs, but I’ll never turn down a great cup of coffee, a good drink, or an active day outdoors. You’ll usually find me scuba diving, trying new recipes in the kitchen, working on a DIY project (I solo-renovated my entire house), or spending time on the water. Family is my foundation, and I’m excited to build a life filled with love, laughter, and meaningful experiences.

I’m looking for someone kind, grounded, and emotionally steady—ideally in her 20s or early 30s—who shares my values and is ready to settle down and create a future together.

If this resonates with you, I’d love to hear your story and see where this could lead. (Just a heads-up: If you’re on a brand-new Reddit account, I might not respond.)",1,1734321962.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I did weigh around 165 a few years ago. One thing that helped me lose weight recently was getting diagnosed with Adhd and taking adderall. It felt like a cheat code, and I hated myself for it. But when I was on the medication I could distinguish between real hunger and when I was needing a dopamine fix. I recently got off the meds because I graduated college and I don't want to be so dependent on them. But I'm back to my struggle with binge eatting and not sticking to healthy foods. I currently work part time at a bakery too which doesn't help 🥲.

I am a little overwhelmed trying to incorporate all the things I've been researching. My goal weight is around 135-140. And I really want to lose weight in a way that is sustainable. But I'm just struggling to figure out how to eat enough protein, and somehow Incorperate foods that have collagen and probiotics, while not eatting too many carbs. But also having enough carbs to have energy throughout the day. I'm just a bit lost. And also incorporate things like L-theanine, And Colostrum? I love healthy food, there's not struggle there. I just don't know how to make it last so I stay full. I drink alot of water too, and I have the occasional coffee or kombucha. 

One other struggle is that I would love to do intermittent fasting, but it is proving difficult with my schedule. I work from 8 to 4, and then I have jiu jitsu 4 nights a week from 5:30 to 7. I could eat right after but that would break my fast. But then I'm super hungry from burning so many calories. And I have no idea if it is a good idea to not eat right after? Or is that bad for me in the long run?

I know I basically just vomited what's going on in my head but I'm hoping someone can make sense of it and help me? I'd greatly appreciate it! Thnx 🙏",0,1734321699.0,loseit,0,0.5,False

1hfajdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/1hfajdk/i_think_my_friend_is_lying_about_being_fully/,I think my friend is lying about being “fully recovered”,"Hi. I’ll try to summarize my friends history with ED’s and explain my current situation briefly. My friend has had an ED for about 10 years (I know nothing about the terms and technical stuff so sorry if I over generalize aspects of her ED) and has been in and out of states of remission and active disordered eating. We met three years ago and at that point she told me her last relapse was only one year ago in 2021. 

We grew closer and this past summer I asked her where she was at in her journey snd she confidently told me “I’m fully recovered.” I was happy for her, but since the summer I’ve been noticing things that lead me to suspect she was lying to me and perhaps herself about being recovered. First of all, she’s a pescatarian which already feels a bit typical. She only eats twice a day and is VERY particular about eating snacks or coffees/boba when offered. She’ll offer excuses every time about being full from her last meal even when that meal was hours ago. Sometimes we hang out for many hours during the day and she’ll mention she’s already eaten breakfast lunch or dinner even when the timing doesn’t add up. 

The meals she does eat are very small and insufficient—one packet of instant oatmeal for breakfast with black coffee (or coffee with almond milk—she also only drinks almond or oat milk), no lunch, and dinner is usually something carby like Mac and cheese or pizza, occasionally fish. I don’t think she’s eating a very large and nutrient dense dinner to balance out the fact that she eats basically nothing all day. Shes extremely avoidant of sugar and drinks everything in diet form, even things like instant hot chocolate have to be reduced sugar. She has no health problems that would require this btw. 

Besides her actions, her words are even more telling. She said just the other day that she keeps wanting a “sweet treat” but can’t allow herself to finish them because she’s in “calorie hell” or something, so she gives the rest to her boyfriend which is causing him to get fat. She’s about 5’9” and weighs no more than 130 lbs. I haven’t noticed her losing weight, but I feel like her habits are so restrictive and particular they seem to be offshoots of disordered eating. I’ve never met anyone who has such specific rules about food and when to eat it. She also told me herself that vegetarianism is a step down from an ED for lots of girls, and that lots of people use it as a sort of in between way of eating. 

I don’t know what to do: we haven’t ever discussed what my responsibility is as her friend if she were to relapse, so I especially don’t know how to process my thoughts about her current lifestyle that she thinks ISN’T disordered but clearly is in my opinion. What would you do? ",1,1734321200.0,fuckeatingdisorders,1,1.0,False

So my biggest trigger is gone for now but the anxiety is still there so I've been doing more stuff to relieve my anxiety and I just wanted to share some tips that I think actually work.

If you are feeling at the pit of despair please ask yourself some questions.

Did you drink water? If you didn't it might be dehydration.

Are you on your period? If you are then go to the doctor and see what options are available. You don't have to accept being anxious because of hormones.

Did you drink caffeine? Did you drink tea on an empty stomach? Well let's not do that. Eat something starchy and just remind yourself this awful feeling is caffeine and it'll go away, but for now just take it easy.

Are your feelings possible symptoms of any medicine or you accidentally forgot to take a medicine? Go take that medicine or go tell your doctor.

Is your room clean? Hire a house keeper if it's too much (not house cleaner because they don't help with clutter at all but you can talk with the house keeper about what you want to have done). It's expensive but absolutely worth the money if it's causing you anxiety.

Did you eat the important vitamins and minerals you need to eat? If you didn't go eat that. Your body needs it.


Did you exercise? Go do something. Dance in the dark or something. Anything to feel that sweet serotonin after your heart gets beating.


Is it really hard to breathe and anxiety feels like it's taking over? Breathe out so hard you can feel the muscles in your stomach. Repeat until you feel better. Do it as slow as possible, too. Or clench your whole body and release.

Did you have a panic attack? Accept it and don't try to stop it. You had a panic attack. These things happen sometimes and it's okay. If you run away from it, it will just get worse.

Can't sleep at all or your sleep schedule is super messed up? Take a sleeping pill and also go asleep way earlier than you plan to. Find out the time you want to wake up at and give yourself like 10 hours from that time and try to sleep with those sleeping pills. It usually works and most importantly you sleep.


These were all stuff that made my anxiety worse and that I found solutions to for myself. I used to try massages, or buying some kind of comfy item, but none of them made my room cleaner. None of them lasted that long.

They feel like obvious stuff but some of this stuff can really fuel the anxiety (especially coffee).

1hfac4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1hfac4o/the_empty_town/,The Empty Town,"Liam was driving through the desert when his car broke down in the middle of nowhere. His phone had no signal, and the sun was beginning to set. In the distance, he spotted a small town—a cluster of weathered buildings against the horizon. Grabbing his backpack, he trudged toward it, hoping to find help.

As he entered the town, he noticed how eerily quiet it was. No cars, no people, not even the sound of the wind. The air felt heavy, and the streets were lined with abandoned shops and homes. Despite the emptiness, everything was intact—tables set for meals, a bike leaning against a lamppost, even a kettle left on a stove. It was as if the townsfolk had vanished in the middle of their day.

Liam wandered into a diner, the door creaking loudly as he pushed it open. The smell of stale coffee lingered in the air. A plate of pancakes sat uneaten on the counter, syrup still dripping off the edges.

“Hello?” he called out, his voice echoing.

No response.

Growing uneasy, he searched the buildings one by one. A schoolhouse with empty desks, a hardware store with tools still on the shelves, a church with candles burned down to stubs. He found no one.

As night fell, he realised he had no choice but to stay until morning. He chose a small motel and let himself into one of the rooms. The bed was neatly made, and a suitcase sat open on the floor, filled with neatly folded clothes.

While rummaging for anything useful, Liam found a Polaroid camera on the nightstand. He picked it up and pressed the shutter out of boredom. The flash went off, momentarily lighting up the room. When the photo developed, his stomach dropped.

In the picture, he wasn’t alone. Behind him stood a crowd of people, staring blankly at the camera.

Heart pounding, he spun around. The room was empty.

He bolted outside, but the streets were still deserted. Breathing heavily, he clutched the camera and took another photo, this time of the diner across the street. The flash illuminated the scene for a split second. When the photo developed, the diner was full of people—sitting, eating, staring.

Liam’s hands shook as he backed away. He took a picture of the street. Again, it came alive with figures—men, women, and children standing motionless, all facing the camera.

Panicked, he started running, but no matter how far he went, the town stretched endlessly in every direction. Desperate, he snapped a photo of himself, hoping for answers.

When the image appeared, Liam stared at it in horror. He was standing in the middle of the crowd, just like the others—frozen, blank-eyed, trapped.

A voice whispered behind him, soft and chilling.

“Welcome to the town, Liam. You’re one of us now.”

He dropped the camera and screamed, but no one was there to hear him.",3,1734320514.0,shortscarystories,1,1.0,False

Honestly im just looking to put myself out there now that i’m sharing my own personal stories. ive been using tiktok recently to post diary entries and some other videos, hoping to attract attention with all the recent news. so if you’d like to check out my information, [here’s the link to my account](https://www.tiktok.com/@cashuallydepressed?_t=8sFi8Q3agBC&_r=1) 

to be clear, i wouldnt exactly call what im going through “mk ultra.” i just see similarities between what people call Mk Ultra and what im experiencing. as anyone else, i just go off what i’ve learned about the world and my personal experience. 

i hope advertising my tiktok is okay. its just where i plan on putting everything rn. 




if you want to read, here’s a bit of my story. 

im 27. i was born into all of this, it started before i was born. 

to be blunt, there’s a population of society that mirrors itself after my life. im like the cream in the coffee. “I Like That” x Janelle Monae, basically.

 i dont believe i was supposed to know this, and if i was, i dont believe i was supposed to talk about it. i believe im meant to be braindead. think Britney Spears Kill the Lights x Code mistake by bmth/corpse. also Plastic off the Sofa x beyonce. 

it isnt obvious. its very personal. like, the details of my life are the little keys that unlock this tunnel under ocean boulevard. and it involves every corner of the world, from the Russian military to Trump to Beyonce to NickEh30. 

im trying to make this as to the point as possible. reading this back, youd think itd be Youtopia (bmth), but no. all this mirroring, everything happening is meant to split myself into two and then put both characters into war with each other. as well, my own personal character becomes erased and altered. 

if you’re wondering why i talk in songs, id like to reference kendrick. *“you know i got language barriers, theres no accent you can sell me.”* a lot of this shit makes no sense. this is why art is so important, to communicate and make sense of the unintelligible. so music is my alien tongue, in a sense. 

i know many songs have their accepted meaning/drama behind them. but much of it takes on a separate meaning when you learn to speak the language. 

*“Its because she’s in a world preserved, only few have found the door.*

*It’s like Camarillo, only silver mirrors running down the corridor.”*

The problem is I'm an extrovert and really enjoy being around people. However, I wouldn't trade working remote for anything and would never want to work in an office, I just want to explore my options for those lonely days. 

I was exploring the idea of joining a coworking space to switch things up now and then. I found a few in my area (Tampa, Florida) and was wondering if anyone has any experience with working at one of these locations. Do they get over crowded, is it first come first serve, and what should I know about coworking etiquacy?

I figure it would be nice to just be around people while getting some work done, share some coffee and network with others instead of sitting alone in my house every single day. ",2,1734319899.0,remotework,1,1.0,False

Hello! This story is kind of a long one so buckle in if you’re up for it. Posted before but wrote it in notes and it didn’t transfer well so redoing for better spacing. First time ever posting on Reddit so I’m sorry if I’m doing it wrong.



   And hi Charlotte! If you ever happen to read this, I love watching your videos. Coming from a fellow people pleaser as this story will show, you remind me a lot of myself and I love that you’ve come so far from trying to let go of that. That’s something I need to get better at but it easier said than done. Congratulations on your engagement. You both look so cute together. 

Back to the story… It put me through a lot of stress at the time and made me sick to my stomach while it was going on but I’ve moved passed it now and am in a much better place

 

   So… I live in Hawaii now and it can be really hard to find a place to live over here. Moved here to be closer to family after Covid and not seeing them for a couple years as a result. Well after living with family for a few months and having to share a room with my sister, I was losing my mind. She’s not the crazy roommate, but I knew I needed to get my own place. 
 


   Well I met this girl when I was out one day… we’ll call her Ashley. This is while I was still living with family. She seemed alright, we became friends for a time. Hung out a couple of times both just the two of us and in a few group settings. In hindsight, a lot of people kind of warned me that she seemed off in some aspects but I try to see the best in people and be a decent person and I hadn’t had any problems with her at that point.
 


   She was needing a place too at the time and I was offered a place by a family friend to move into pretty quickly. Keep in mind there are a lot of rundown places out here, especially in the more jungle like areas of the island and I moved into a shack version of a shack on a coffee farm. It was a pretty rough spot. She moved in with me and we were there for a few months. She was going through some personal drama that I won’t get into because that’s not my place, but I gave her a lot of passes for her up and down moods and was an ear to her problems a lot.
   


  After a few months in the shack, which wasn’t necessarily the easiest or most comfortable living conditions, an opportunity to move into another much nicer place closer to the main town over here came up. Closer to my family who live just up the hill from me now and much closer to work instead of making the long drives in the morning and evenings. It’s a house that’s split between the upstairs and downstairs which is what I was moving into. The downstairs is a ONE BEDROOM. Now, because her and I were friends and I knew she wouldn’t feel comfortable living with strangers, especially men she might not know (the shack we were in was rented out on a room basis with 3 rooms there but we paid extra so it would just be the two of us), I offered to let her move with me to the new place. BIG MISTAKE. 


    At first we agreed and talked about how we would manage the living arrangement. I would take the bedroom and she would live in the living room with dividers that we planned to get to separate the space (the living area is pretty big and there was plenty of space to do this). I told her I could probably help get the dividers and I knew I’d be paying more for taking the bedroom. We talked about how the cost would be split. I would be paying 2/3 of the rent and we’d split the utilities. She came back later on and told me, she only wanted to pay a set amount every month which would have been 1/3 of the rent and none of the utilities because she didn’t have her own room. Fine, I didn’t want to argue on the matter. Whatever. 
  


  Eventually it was about time for us to move out and she said an opportunity came up for her to dog/house sit for a few months and asked if I would be okay if she didn’t move in with me after all. I told her, sure, that was fine. I figured then with it being just me, I wanted to order some things to make the new place more homely. I ordered some bookshelves, a tv stand to put the tv in the living room. Some things to fill in the space more so it wouldn’t feel so empty being just me. It was money I spent on things because I didn’t think she was going to move in with me after all.
 


   She ended up moving out of the original spot earlier than I did to start house sitting and it immediately fell through so she asked me if she could still live with me after all. I told her sure, but I spent money on other things thinking she wasn’t going to be joining me and I couldn’t afford to get the dividers. She moved in with me anyways and this begins my month of hell.



    My landlord was sweet and offered us some of the things in the house that were already in it. A small twin sized bed because Ashley didn’t have a bed and slept on my futon at the other house. A small desk and tiny dresser that were already here. Sheets and blankets for her to use. She barely owned anything and most of the things in the house were mine. 



   Right after we moved in, she quit her job and decided to work small side gigs instead like cleaning some of the local air B&Bs. And she met up with guys who would pay her to hang out with them. We didn’t have dividers, she lived in the open living room and me, feeling bad, spent most of my time in my bedroom so that she could have her privacy.  The bathroom has two doors, one to the main living area and a second sliding door to my bedroom. We also have a decent backyard and I have a door in the bedroom that leads to the backyard so I would use that a lot in the mornings to leave for work. Her mood changes at the new place got worse and worse and soon I found myself constantly walking on eggshells. 



Uncomfortable spending any time in the house besides my bedroom. She took up gardening in the backyard so it felt like she took that over too and I was basically paying a bunch of money to have a bedroom while she had the whole rest of the house and backyard and I was paying the utilities while I was gone at work a lot and she would spend all day at the house. 



Eventually she would have a guy that would come over for… you know, and I couldn’t even leave my bedroom to do so much as make coffee for myself. She’d make it and leave it for me in the bathroom. He came in late at night and wouldn’t even leave until like noon. Honestly, I was going stir crazy and grew to hate the living situation. I didn’t trust talking to her unless she spoke to me first because I wasn’t sure what mood she would be in. And eventually she began throwing the dividers in my face, holding it over my head. Like, you need to get this! You said you were going to get it! Which was something I said I could help with before I spent money on other things and before she had said she only wanted to pay a certain amount and none of the utilities basically. I didn’t have the money. 



    But she kept pushing and pushing and I was over it. I was looking at dividers on Amazon trying to find good ones after one particularly pushy day from her. Saved some for ideas (they were not cheap by any means) and wanted to get her input before I ordered it. Well I got home that day using the back door to enter my bedroom and had to go into the kitchen for something. Wasn’t sure what mood she was in so I wasn’t going to say anything. She said hi to me though so I thought it was okay and stupidly approached her with my phone to show her some of the dividers I found. She paused for a moment and then helped me measure the area and we picked it out and I ordered it on my credit card. I thought the issue would be resolved and things would mellow out and get better now that that was ordered and set to come. How WRONG I was. I was keeping to myself in my bedroom later that same night when she began to BLOW UP on me! 
 


   Like how dare I approach and talk to her. She didn’t want to talk to me. I should have texted her if I needed to talk to her about something. (I wasn’t even going to say anything but thought it would be okay to talk about it when she said hi to me and messaged me earlier that day holding over my head the fact that I said I’d get the dividers so I’m probably an idiot for that) She doesn’t have to talk to me all the time. Oh, I’m so controlling or pushing her boundaries because I entered her space which was not okay. She didn’t like that my stuff was in the living area and couldn’t deal with hoarder energy (this wasn’t the case. 



    Sure  some of my things were there like the futon and the  2 bookshelves with knickknacks and a smaller bookshelf with my records and record player lined up on the wall but I was just trying to make a nice comfortable living area that I already felt like I couldn’t spend time in. And everything in the kitchen was mine) and more of my things needed to go into my bedroom. She was in her self care era and how I needed to respect that. She said I was a liar or not true to my word because I bought other things instead of the dividers like I said I would and my word basically means nothing. According to her, I owed her… despite her eating my food, using up and taking some of my expensive products and makeup and my essential oils and my cleaning supplies, etc.



    She ALSO said she WOULD NOT be paying rent until the dividers came and that did floor me a bit. We had been there almost a month at this point, rent was due in a few days and the dividers would not arrive for like two weeks. I had just put a couple hundred dollars towards the divider to get a large one with a curtain. I could only manage to get one at the time and she talked her friend into helping her get the other one, but it was still a lot of money. Financials were a bit tight but I could manage. She also refused to pay rent until she was put on the lease… now my landlord did not want to put her on the lease after she decided she wasn’t going to move in with me and then suddenly she was. So I knew that wasn’t going to happen. She was kind of written on the lease on the side with her info as being kind of a sub tenant to me. 



    I was already so over it and sick to my stomach and uncomfortable with the whole living situation. There was some back and forth, but eventually I said something along the lines of, “this doesn’t appear to be working out. I’ve tried to help you and nothing I do is good enough. Going to cancel the dividers. Rent is due soon, either help or I don’t want you around anymore” (I’ll see if I can add some of the message screen texts. It gets pretty bad). This was my last message to her. She kept blowing up my phone with some of the worst messages she could think of to hurt me but I never responded again. I ABSOLUTELY canceled the order for the divider… Because I’m true to my word.
  


  Eventually she agreed to move out but told me she would be out by a certain date and I was not allowed back into my home until she was gone because she didn’t want to see my face. Made a bunch of rude insults to me, talked about how she suddenly has a great opportunity coming up that she would have had if I weren’t so awful. How she’s moving onto better things and I made her life better. 



     I was receiving all of this at work and couldn’t focus. Was sick to my stomach about things going on at the house. Even went to the police station to find out what my options were. Didn’t really have many at the time. My landlord though was made aware of the situation and how she was talking about how she was about to have a free place to live. Told me I absolutely had to go home because she was worried she would try to push me out of my house and squat there. I needed to anyways because she turned out to be a kleptomaniac and I didn’t trust her not to rob me or run up my bills out of spite. Landlord said if she had anyone over that night, to let her know and her and my dad and my stepmom (who she’s friends with) would come down to the house with chairs and drinks. I went straight home after work and went in through my bedroom door and stayed there for a bit.



   Well! She did have a friend of hers over that night. I knew the guy was harmless and poor guy had a thing for her which she used to her advantage to get things from him, but I told them regardless and down to the house they did in fact come. Her and her friend were at the picnic bench in the backyard and we set up with chairs and a cooler just a few feet away chatting casually paying them no mind.  



   You could tell they were uncomfortable and eventually they went inside, closed all the curtains and you could hear some rustling around. She packed and left THAT NIGHT. I took the next day off from work and did not leave until the day hit a couple days later that she said she would be out of the house by and changed those locks! Figured that way I wouldn’t get into legal trouble in case she tried to enter the premises before then because she was technically a tenant and probably would have had rights up to her move out date.


   I still live here. The energy has definitely shifted and I’m much happier without the toxicity she brought into my life. There are some things I’ve noticed that she stole from me, but it could have been worse and I don’t have to deal with her anymore.




Sorry it’s so long. I tried to give context and the whole situation was a lot. AITA? Was I in the wrong with the dividers? Could it have been handled differently? Wish I listened when others said they had a bad vibe from her but it happened and it’s over. Can only take the lesson learned and move on.


Note: I have a cat but absolutely can’t have dogs on property. She brought a dog over to dog sit and had a makeshift leash sitting in the backyard. When my landlord asked about it because she comes by to maintain the property, she caught Ashley in a lie claiming it was for my cat who is a completely indoor cat.",3,1734319866.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

My SIL immediately jumped into action and sent over excellent options. She even offered to order and wrap the presents.

We had eachother on social media but didn’t speak a whole lot until recently. 

We began hanging out casually, we went on walks together, we went to coffee and a few other activities. I personally saw him as a friend.  

It wasn’t too long after he began to act really odd, he would always compare himself to me and put me on some kind of pedestal. He’d always say how confident and secure I was in myself and how he insecure he was, he also spoke about how he respects the fact that I can say to no sex as where as he feels like he HAS to. It was very mild comments at first but it got more and more obvious.

I don’t message ANY of my friends good morning  but he’d message me every so often with “Morning x”, maybe it’s just a me thing but I find it odd to message people morning texts without any reason.

We went to a small gay event one evening and there was a man who was pretty obviously attracted to me (being somewhat touchy and flirtatious) but the feelings weren’t the same and I didn’t reciprocate anything. Once me and my ‘friend’ had left he would NOT stop talking about the man that paid me attention. He kept on saying that the guy ignored him when in fact he didn’t and there was 4 other people there he was also talking to. 

One night he sent me nude mirror selfie (you couldn’t actually see his dick or his ass, he was just posing) I sent him a silly response saying “Oooh la la” and he got really upset. He began saying things like “So you think I’m ugly?” “So you think it looks bad then?”. I hadn’t said those things. There was another night where he texted me pretty late and I didn’t see his message until the morning and he messaged me saying “you’re ringing me then?” When I didn’t even see his message yet.

I’m honestly getting a strong impression not only was he insecure, but he had a thing for me as well. Does anybody else have any other thoughts?",0,1734319647.0,askgaybros,0,0.5,False

","Hey guys, I'm (29M) having a genuinely hard problem with sitting down to start and work on a big project. Whenever I have time to do it, I always end up opting out and doing many tasks around the house instead. This gives me a general sense of fulfillment however I always have a looming bigger task that seems to just coast by the wayside instead of being worked on. I was always severely nervous or distrusting when it came to any medication that had to do with focusing due to people around me getting hooked on them. I started eating healthier, I stopped drinking every day, I go to the gym, I pretty much am trying to get to as barebones as possible so I can try and figure out what my body actually needs. Aside from a drink here and there, or smoking pot at night to get some sleep, I have genuinely progressed with my health these last 6 months and I am proud of that. Now that I have gotten to a point that I am close to considering that it is a chemical issue, I keep wondering if there is something else I am missing or something I do not know about that would be able to help me instead of getting a prescription that would end up me possibly leaning into it once I realize it is helping.

Some context, maybe this will help:  
My dad was always a very heavy drinker, I am addicted to caffeine (just coffee unless its a late night and I need a red bull), cigs, and since I stopped drinking it has been sugar later on into the night.

I am a standup comedian who in my personal opinion has been doing well in his local scene. I am not a headliner by any means however my peers do consistently and positively bring up my work ethic for the craft. I do not enjoy much of the positive feedback I receive because I know how much time I genuinely waste instead of sitting down nose to the grindstone and writing (big project I have going on right now is I want to begin writing a low budget movie I would LOVE to figure out how to make.)

It has gotten to the point where I obsess over the time I waste, to the point where I end up trying to count how many minutes I wasted today. I am actively thinking right now about me wasting time writing this in the event that it goes nowhere instead of writing which I probably would put off doing other things anyway.

I guess my ultimate questions are:  
Does anyone or has anyone faced this and came up with some answers on how to fix their attention issues?  
At what point is my fascination with wanting to be obsessed at all time about writing unhealthy BOTH before I figure out how to do it all the time AND while I'm just bullying myself into not doing anything at all?

I take it to heart when I see people in my field work harder than me and I would like nothing more than to figure out how to just work without being so easily distracted or willing to do smaller tasks with immediate gratification.

I do really try to work my ass off, every day or night I have off I do whatever possible to put into my want of being a working comic. This is the road I want to go down regardless of if I become rich or famous, I just want to be the best I can be and make people laugh. The rest will come. I am in no rush and have no intention on pissing away the years of me learning and coming up. I did that in my 20s, I do not regret it, but I want to figure out how to get my head right so I can work on the things I want to work on.

Thank you. I am keenly aware that this career choice, that people have way bigger problems, and that on this page this is not of as much importance as some of the stories people post. I hope to find somewhat of a lead to guide me in possibly figuring this all out. Thanks guys, I hope you have an awesome holiday.",1,1734319615.0,self,0,1.0,False

I'm 27f 5'1"" 108lbs. I don't drink or smoke. I take Ryaltris nasal spray for allergies and use qbrexza towelettes on my underarms.

I have had a sore throat since early August (so a little over 4 months now) and I have seen multiple doctors and ENTs and I have no idea what's going on. One morning in August I randomly woke up with a sore throat. I thought I was getting a cold, however, I had no fever and it never developed into anything further. My energy was (and still is) completely fine, and other than the sore throat, I feel absolutely normal. I took a covid test (negative), a rapid strep test (negative), and a throat culture (negative).

About a month into having a sore throat, I saw an ENT. He did a nasal endoscopy and said everything looked normal. About a month later, I saw another ENT. She scheduled me to get a CT scan of my throat and sinuses and the results came back normal.

My symptoms include: sore / dry feeling throat. Sometimes feels like there is a lump in my throat. Constantly clearing my throat, an occasional mild dry cough. Frequent talking aggravates it further.

At this point, it's driving me crazy and is interfering with my life. I don't drink, smoke, I don't even drink coffee. I eat quite clean and rarely eat out. I've cut out chocolate and all carbonated drinks. The only thing I can conclude is LPR, but I really don't experience reflux that often so I'm skeptical.

Does anyone know what this could possibly be and what kind of further testing I should request? I'm going to schedule a follow up with my ENT this week. This is so discouraging though.",1,1734319533.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Basically, for the last week or so, she's been really stressed out both because of work and family related issues. She's been leaving me on delivered or read for hours during this time and even though it makes me really anxious, I've been sort of dealing with it cause I know she's going through stuff and is busy. Also I want to clarify that we aren't long distance, but we rarely get to see each other irl. Two nights ago, she sent me a message about how she was sorry, cause she knows her bad mood has been rubbing off on me and stuff. I basically just replied saying that It's okay, I know she's going through a lot, I'll always be there, etc. But this was at like 3 AM so I knew there was more I wanted to say, but I couldn't really put it into words.

Then we go to yesterday, where we exchanged a few messages and I say that I figured out what I wanted to add onto our conversation the night before, but ask for permission first in case she doesn't even want to talk about it. She says, yes, it's okay, and I send a long long message. She reads it an hour later, but doesn't reply. Hours go by and she doesn't reply, but I had stated in the message to only reply when she's no longer busy. In the middle of the night again she replies asking if I actually like her as much as I say and want to have a future with her because a lot of people have manipulated her in the past and I say that it's what I want more than anything. I then ask about the not replying, and if it really is cause she's busy, or if there's another reason like if replying makes her feel worried/scared or smth.

This is where it gets slightly insane in my opinion, she says that she does it intentionally, because she wants to test if I actually care and will keep messaging her until she replies. And it's like, I really really do care, but I also want to have decency and not spam text her like a possessive asshole. So instead of spamming I basically just feel like shit waiting for a response. I tell her that and she says that me being clingy and spamming her with messages is exactly what she wants. Even though I already felt hurt last night, I thought it was a good thing cause there was always something between us that didn't really make sense, but this was it. I was always wanting to message but didn't want to be annoying, and she wanted me to be annoying the whole time. Then today, I tried what she suggested, like sending a lot more messages and I guess she seems a litttttttleeee more engaged but I've been thinking about it, and I feel really hurt about what she's been doing. She knows I have anxiety, and at this point she should know that I REALLY do care, like why was she basically playing hard to get when we're already together? So I sent another long message asking that now that she's admitted that behavior to me, to please stop doing it cause it makes me insanely stressed out. She replies after a few minutes saying that her cousin just showed up and they're gonna get coffee, but ignored what I said.

Andddd that's basically where I'm at now, I literally have no clue how I should feel. Is what she did actually appropriate and I'm incorrect for feeling this way? I'm not sure if I should just wait and see how she replies and go based off of that, or if I should just end things now because of like how much it affected me. I just want to mention, things were not like this until recently, like I guess she would take a long time to reply sometimes, but not to the point where it would actually bug me. I'm just so confused, I have no clue what I'm doing. I know I'm probably being a legitimate idiot but be patient with me please LMAO, and give your genuine thoughts.",1,1734319236.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

","My boyfriend and I first connected through a random voice chat on a Discord server. He is from Texas, and I'm from Buenos Aires. After a year and a half of virtual interaction, we met in person last month. He booked a one-way ticket and stayed at my apartment, with little planning for what would follow. We lived together for two weeks until the events described unfolded.

One evening, after finishing my remote work, he returned home intoxicated following an outing with a high school ""friend"" who was also visiting the city. Recognizing his inebriated state, I told him to leave and suggested he stay with his ""friend"". This he hated, as he insisted on staying with me.

In a state of desperation, he climbed the footrail of my balcony and shouted that life was not worth living without me. I screamed for him to stop and fled to my bathroom. Although I had heard such words from him before, seeing him physically place himself on the ledge left me feeling traumatized. It became clear that the situation had escalated beyond what I could manage alone.

Later that night, I left the apartment. As we only had one key, I effectively locked myself out. He eventually found me and, after some resistance, handed over the key. Despite his attempts to reconcile—cooking dinner, drinking coffee, and apologizing profusely—I remained in shock and unable to process everything fully.

The following morning, I sought advice from my brother and sister-in-law, uncertain about the best course of action. While I regret involving others instead of deciding independently, I felt paralyzed by fear and indecision. My primary concern was that confronting him about leaving could provoke another crisis or self-h### threat.

They recommended involving the police, believing that an authoritative intervention might compel him to take the situation seriously. When we returned to the apartment, he was showering and grooming himself, seemingly in an act of repentance. As two officers, my brother, his partner, and I waited outside the bathroom, he was surprised and humiliated. The police escorted him to the U.S. embassy, and his mother funded a same-day flight home.

However, unable to wait for his flight, he contacted his friend, who invited him to stay and go out partying. He postponed his departure by a week, attempting to drown his pain in alcohol. That night he wondered off the club with a bottle of gin and was attacked by a group of teenagers who stole his belongings and left him injured. An ambulance found him intoxicated and took him to a public hospital of substandard quality.

The next day, I received an email from a nurse stating, ""Please help \_\_\_\_; he is at the \_\_\_\_ hospital."" I rushed there fearing the worst. I found him curled up in a hospital bed, dirty, bruised, and with no way to contact anyone. After hours of coordinating with his family, we managed to secure an Airbnb where he could recover. I couldn’t bring him back to my apartment, and I had little money beyond covering his food and transportation.

Eventually, he returned to Texas. Surprisingly, we continued communicating, despite everything. While I anticipated our relationship would end, neither of us could let go. Discussions about the incident have been fraught and unresolved. He becomes defensive, while I withdraw. His repeated attempts to contact me forced me to change my number, which he no longer has.

He argues that I don’t trust him and questions why I remain in a relationship with someone I distrust. He attributes his behavior—the suicide threat, spamming, and defensiveness—as a reaction to mine: going hot and cold, ghosting, and critical remarks. While he has been sober since the incident and shows signs of effort, I recognize the limitations of our dynamic. I know he is toxic, but I question whether I am too, and whether we are, in fact, a perfect match in our dysfunction.

I have always questioned what life is all about, why we are here, and how I can live a fulfilling life. Were we just put here to suffer and then die? Many things happening in society just don’t make sense to me. I am appalled by society's moral decay, the death of family values, the craze for social media fame, likes, and subscriptions, the narcissism and materialism of the world, and the overall superfluity of life today. I just want a simple yet meaningful and fulfilling life. Like it’s the 80s or 90s: I want to fall in love and be loved.

Because:
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, and it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.

At this point in my life, I have my priorities straight. I now know exactly what I want from life and what will bring me everlasting happiness. I love the simple things — laughing, cooking, having home dinners with family and friends, helping others grow, mentoring, home parties with games, quiet moments to myself, in my thoughts, walks under the moonlit skies, a quiet evening at home, the gentle cuddles of a loving partner, watching the sunset, a good meal, a walk by the beach, and creating simple, sweet, unforgettable memories. I deeply enjoy the peace, comfort, and reassurance of being around a loving partner. That gentle reminder that this right here is home and nothing else matters but us and what we do and achieve together. No competition, no jealousy, no ego and pride, no anger or hate, no fears of losing each other, no “me vs you”. Us.

I dream of the whole package in life: Picture a small beautiful dream and cozy house with lots of space and a backyard, a family with adorable, happy, and well-raised kids running around, a happy beautiful wife, and overall, a beautiful, loving, and happy family, with lots of love and laughter. Growing old together. Ultimately, this is the most important and precious thing in life. This is a life worth living, far beyond pursuing wealth, status, titles, fame, etc. My family should be my priority and ultimate responsibility in every aspect and I want a woman who shares this mindset. I work hard but my hard work and ambition aren’t just to have money (I don’t need much money for myself, I don’t have many responsibilities, and I am not materialistic. Fancy things such as cars, jewelry, shoes, and clothes do not impress me). I aim to achieve financial freedom solely so I can have much more time with my family, provide a comfy life, afford a dream home with comfortable living spaces and beautiful play areas, and be able to eliminate the stress and tension that come with financial worries. Also, as a man, working hard and achieving goals adds meaning and purpose to my life. And I would love someone who encourages me with words of affirmation, even though I need to encourage myself more. I don't like just sitting around doing nothing. At the same time, pursuing financial freedom shouldn’t jeopardize quality family time or time with my loved ones. I want to have a traditional family unit with a modern twist. This means that I don’t expect my wife to do all the housework and childcare. I don’t want to just throw money at her and sit back. These are also my responsibilities. So it is normal to share house chores, cooking, and other such endeavors, especially if she has a career.

I would love a partner to share love, comfort, memories, and life with. I want to have family breakfasts, enjoy family dinners, pick up my kids from school, cook dinner together with my woman while dancing in the kitchen, adore and appreciate my woman, and read bedtime stories to my children, I want to be that couple who hold each other in the living room and slowly dance to evening love songs, I want to cuddle her and kiss her neck as we dance, dance that very slowly turns intimate, with touching, kissing, and slow passionate lovemaking (not just sex - I differentiate lovemaking from having sex), with the background music still playing, just have pillow talk, and kiss my wife goodnight every day, I want to put up Christmas decorations with her and wrap our children’s gifts together. To go and countdown on New Year’s Eve while holding hands. I want to wake up every morning loving life without complaints, appreciating what I have, and thanking God for life. I want to train, nurture, and watch our beautiful children and someday hold my wife and share a cry of joy as we watch our babies fade into the sunset of adulthood and college, knowing that we raised them to be the best society can offer, capable of handling all that comes their way and trusting us to be there for them in the inevitable challenges of their teenage years. I want my wife to be my partner in crime. My most trusted confidant, whom I can rely on 100% to handle our affairs when I am not around and vice versa because I believe in her abilities and intelligence. She should be the one I run to for advice and counsel when I am stuck. She should be the one I count on to manage and advise on our finances and she will reign as queen over our affairs at home, with my healthy support, and be by me as I strive to put food on our table, and a shelter over our head and to provide and protect our household.

I want us to be that old couple walking down the street holding hands, sitting at the park feeding the pigeons, or helping each other pick groceries. I want to be that couple who still makes jokes at each other and laughs even in their 80s, who welcomes their children and grandchildren during Christmas and other holidays and have a blast telling them stories of their lives—the same old stories they've already told a million times.

To achieve this, I need to trust my woman enough to completely lay down my guard, be myself, and be completely vulnerable and emotionally available. To listen to her needs love her dearly and always reassure her of this love. I need to learn to communicate better, uplift her, openly praise the great things about her, and support her endeavors. I need to seek help for any issues that might sabotage our relationship. And learn to set boundaries when I need them and respect her boundaries when they are set. I need to take action to make our relationship better: Buy her flowers, plan dates, organize fun events, prepare surprises, and do other things that show her how much I am committed to making our relationship grow and our bond stronger and bring liveliness to the relationship. She shouldn't carry all the burden of making our relationship work.

Family means the world to me, coming from what I think is one of the best families ever. I want to start my own and be an even better father and husband than my father was. He was the best father in the world. I draw inspiration from him and many father figures in my life. I want to be a dad, not just a father and I want to be a husband, I don’t want to just get married or have a wife. I want to contribute to the world by raising children with strong moral principles. Children who do not add to the suffering of the world but grow to be men and women of strong values. Who live a life that has depth in a world that is plagued by the constant pursuit of superficial things. A world full of deceit and evil. Who grow to be good people, worthy of respect and honor, and who treat others with dignity. Children that others will say of them, “You are a good person”.

Finding the right person takes time, and I’m okay with that. Once I find someone reciprocating my love and who shares this vision, I will be locked in and will give her all the assurance she needs to feel secure and safe in our relationship. I will never let go when trouble comes but try to find solutions instead. I understand just how important open communication is in that difficult moment. I understand just how precious reassurance is to the peace and well-being of my woman. Not just verbal reassurance. Reassurance also shows through actions and even in day-to-day conversations. Referring to “us” and “our”, not “me” and “my” when having discussions. Reassurance gives her the peace and comfort needed to stay happy and grounded in what we have. It also makes her feel that this right here is home for her and I am not going anywhere. It makes her free to let go knowing that I am hers and nothing will change. It takes away her anxiety and best of all, it makes me love her even more. She should never question her place and worth in my life. The best lessons are learned from bitter experiences.

I do not find pleasure in wild adventures such as partying, clubbing, getting drunk cheap flings, or other things that complicate my life. I don’t smoke, do drugs, get drunk, or pursue casual sex, and I vow to myself to never cheat on my partner as this is one of the very few sins that I can't forgive in a relationship. I am also taking the time to understand my emotions and personality through reading, watching videos, and therapy so that I will be a well-rounded man who understands his mind, personality, and emotions and how to treat a woman the best way possible.

In a relationship, I know that I should be able to change certain habits or ways of doing things that my partner finds unappealing and I expect the same from her. However, I should accept them for who they are, not try to bend them to a version of themselves that they hate. I always envision a good couple building each other up in terms of personalities and habits. Such things should be communicated more romantically and affectionately in a way that uplifts her, makes her feel appreciated and loved, and strengthens our bond rather than in a critical manner.

What makes me happy? Simple things like breakfast together, sharing tea or coffee in our home, goofy jokes, sharing silly memes, checking in and supporting one another (something I need to get better at), new experiences, thoughtful surprised gifts, the outdoors during sunny days, the indoors during stormy days, hanging out with family and friends, trips to natural destinations, sharing a home-cooked dinner with friends and family, having a sense of purpose, making a positive impact on those around me, passionate love-making (not just sex), and treating others with respect and dignity.

I love good food and enjoy cooking together with my woman with some background music. A movie night with popcorn, cuddled in a blanket - and being in that moment, not in my head, a competitive bowling session, and many such simple activities that build bonding and relaxation. I need to get out of my head more often, enjoy these present moments, and worry less about the future, and other things that I have no control over.

I am learning to set and enforce boundaries when I need them to sort my thoughts and do so in a way that doesn’t leave my partner alienated or anxious about my commitment to her. I often felt like, setting boundaries was punishing my partner and cutting her off from myself. Like putting her in a cage and locking her away. Boundaries are very important for regaining one's composure and lead to clearer and better-thought-out communication. Because I saw boundaries as something bad, I was also terrible at respecting them because they felt like I was being exiled or cast away.

I am financially stable with a good career. Beyond my job, I am working on other endeavors that I hope will someday generate income to supplement my salary and make me more financially free. I hope to keep building these, and hopefully, my efforts will pay off. I would love a partner who has hobbies and supports such endeavors, either by encouraging me or supporting me in other ways. Words of affirmation can go a long way.

The things I truly value are good moral principles, integrity (especially with money. I can't trust people whom I can't trust with money and I trust too easily), honesty, commitment (I demand more of this from myself too), and fairness ⚖️. I would like someone with similar values and principles. Many relationships today are centered around who makes more money, who has what, and couples actively planning how to get out of the relationship with the most shit. Who keeps the pet, owns the house, and has custody. These stories and accompanying vengeful behaviors make me feel hopeless sometimes, but there is hope. I want someone who doesn't care about things like this. Someone who's not planning an exit strategy, who is not overly materialistic and showy. Someone I can trust with my life's worth without fear of ending up on the streets or losing my kids. Someone who after the worst fight can still reconcile, laugh about it, and love each other even more. Not someone who holds grudges, is vindictive and always planning their revenge. Someone forgiving and who can apologize and ask for forgiveness. I'd forgive almost anything the first time if my partner explained themselves and asked for forgiveness.

I hope she’s simply a good person who treats others with dignity, respect, and politeness, regardless of their social status or what they look like. I hate it when people look down on others. Someone who thanks the waiter for their service and helps the elderly or handicapped who are struggling or need help. Someone who tips the crippled by the road and makes friends with the stranger. Someone who sees the good in humanity and doesn't assume the worst of people.

The other quality I look for is someone who doesn’t buy into the idea of fairytale love like in Cinderella and the couples you see on social media. Those are not real. True love sometimes feels boring but still feels assured and safe. It is more calm and grounded in reality. It requires effort, initiative, and trust. Taking the initiative to do things that make us happy, have fun and bond more is something I have also failed at in the past. To organize date nights, and go out more for simple walks, to get rid of my phone and electronics during our time together, to find and play fun games, to be playful and goofy, not to take life too seriously, and not work so hard all the time, to go on road trips or weekends away, to lay my guards down, get out of my head and be present in all of this. I now know better from experience, my past failures, and therapy.

True love fails sometimes and has flaws. It gets hard sometimes; picture a crying and sick baby, mental health issues, a sick partner, accidents, unforeseen disasters. Love goes through the storms without giving up. Sometimes, we fight and get at each others’ throats and get nasty. Love is being able to beg for forgiveness and forgive and keep loving even more without holding grudges. It is supportive of each other, being there in the thick and the thin without giving up, it seeks solutions to problems not a way out. It is not distracted by external forces or influences, it praises and uplifts each other rather than criticizes. True love is holding hands and walking down the street together when we are old and gray - or bald in my case (I love seeing old couples together), dying together with a smile on our faces knowing that we gave it our all and overcame all the ups and downs.

In the end, I just want to fall in love. The old kind of love and live a simple, happy life away from all the chaos of cities, the madness of social media, and the confusion of modern society.

This will give my life the ultimate happiness, meaning, purpose, and fulfillment. It will be a life well lived and I’d die a happy man!!

I’m planning to pursue an MTech in India while working, and eventually, I want to go for a PhD. (Yes, I’m one of those people who loves learning.) Having completed my BTech in Computer Science and Engineering, I’m exploring which branches I should focus on for MTech and PhD. Should I go all-in on AI, Data Science, or Cybersecurity?

I have two little dogs a miniature schnauzer and a toy Australian shepherd. Female and male. Lately they’ve been just horrendous to deal with especially the female schnauzer, she’ll get into anything she can and eat it (garbage, candle wax, anything off the tables by the couches including moldy food) then she’s up puking all night and keeping us up. She steals my other dogs food, and mine if she gets the chance doesn’t give a shit about discipline. She doesn’t listen, and they both will pee in the house any chance they get when they think you’re not watching,  even if they were just outside. When I tell the female to do something she’ll do that crap like she’s testing you, just stand there and give you this look ignoring you until you go grab her.

If I leave them alone with my husband for the day or a night I can 100% expect to come home to one of them has gotten into a garbage or peed all over the bathroom rugs and it hasn’t been cleaned. We let them outside and as soon as he lets them in he doesn’t grab them to wipe their paws off and it’s been raining a lot lately so he just lets them destroy the floors. My husband completely babies them and doesn’t ever discipline them so of course it’s become a bad cop good cop situation. He literally coddles them after they’ve been put in the kennel for doing something bad. Or they are CONSTANTLY laying on him every chance they get kissing up. I can not deal with a newborn and two dogs I can’t trust in a room alone by themselves for 5 minutes. I feel guilty for disliking them but I truly do not like the female so much to the point where I don’t want her in my house anymore. I don’t need my life to be harder than it is going to be in a few months, I can’t be juggling a newborns sleep schedule and a dogs when they’ve decided to eat something they shouldn’t and are up shitting every half an hour. (Cow poop, garbage , dirt, a chew toy, coffee, ect.) Happens too often! 

I have never liked little dogs and have always had big dogs but my husbands family loves little dogs and are scared of big ones.

There's nothing at home I ever wish for, as there are vegan alternative for everything. But outside of the home, it's a sacrifice. It's such a sacrifice that I can hardly even encourage others to be vegan instead of just being vegetarian, being that I'm such an empath. Non-vegetarisnism I find inexusable, but I find it hard to see others suffer the martyrdom of veganism the way I do. I happily do it because it's second-nature now, but I do find it depressing to watch a movie or TV show with people at a diner. To just go into a diner, order coffee and a meal. It's so romantic. But for a vegan it's not a part of the community we're really invited into. It's amazing to think that for carnists, every restaurant is a ""vegan"" restaurant. Every potential mate is a ""vegan"". The world's just a culinary paradise and everything is as it should be for them. It certainly makes me feel isolated from the community. They just live in this whole other storybook reality. I guess it doesn't help that I went vegan alone and haven't met a confirmed real vegan in my 17 years of being vegan. I've met a few who claimed to be but weren't actually. Maybe I just have to look into living somewhere where there's more of us. At least we're making grounds in the mainstream and we're in an upward trajectory. But I was just watching a TV show and the townsfolk are all in the diner happy as can be and it's just like, ugh. I can't have that. So thank you to everyone else who is towing the line with me.

Despite my age I’ve lived many lives. Each of my decisions have been painfully thought over. The kicker is, I never know what to choose. I’d like to live in the moment and  not to feel like I’m stuck in eternity. 
        Each of life’s little decisions to me has untold roads to follow, streets to see and moments to live in. Simple decisions are meticulously thought through. What time will I do my food shop at? What time would I have to leave to be on time for class? Will I meet the lads for a coffee or food?
          I can’t stop myself following each road. Starting the journey is just as terrifying as thinking of the end.Experiencing every persons reactions to me as I walk, who might talk to me or someone I’d have the courage to go and introduce myself to. In almost every road I’m by myself. Scared of what people might think of me if they’d be so nice to spare a thought for me. I don’t say that with malice but with understanding, people are too busy most of the time in their own mind to think of strangers. Sparing a thought for someone else is a beautiful thing. 
           Once I’ve made my decision after strenuous thought I make sure not to stray from the road. Keep all my words and movements in line so I don’t embarrass myself someway or somehow. 
It’s a horrible act I put on. Suppressing anything spontaneous or fun in the moment to keep up the act. I would still like to be remembered of course with a polished image nothing bad to be remembered by. I care too much about what people think of me I guess. But I’m bad for judging others too even though I try my best not to. I think in my judgment of others I allow myself to be judged by the small things I see of myself in them. 
           To only think about yourself and how you’ll be judged by others is a selfish habit. I’m so concerned with how they’ll view me I don’t try to understand them. I hate it. I hate thinking about myself. But I still put myself through the micro tortures of walking my paper streets. Will It change? Probably not now but hopefully in the future.

Please bear with me and if anyone could take the time to read what happened and let me know their thoughts that would be great. 

I have a Subaru Crosstrek Premium 2024. Two weeks ago, I found (3) mouse droppings in my cup holder/ around the center console. (I keep no food in the car, only had an iced coffee in there). Brought it to Subaru and there were 0 signs of mice nesting after thorough inspection. Today, found more droppings (7 ish pieces) - checked engine and spare tire compartment and glove box- no other signs. I’ve had peppermint oil in my car ever since finding droppings two weeks ago. I park my car in a garage. 

I decided to try spray bottle spraying some peppermint oil DILUTED WITH WATER under the hood, but then realized that this might be dangerous to the engine components and spray bottle sprayed some plain water under there to try to wash the peppermint solution off. I admittedly wasn’t thinking and was just so anxious about getting this solved and didn’t realize that this may not be smart until after. Now I’m panicking that I made a mistake by getting under the hood wet. Can someone please help me answer these?

1- why is the mouse coming in, pooping, and not nesting? What is going on here?

2- is the small amount of water that I spray / misted under the hood going to hurt the car?

3- is peppermint oil DILUTED heavily okay to spray under the hood after all?

4- what else should I do? I’m so freaked out about having damage done to my car. I have the peppermint baggies under my seats and I added some moth balls to the spare tire well. I never have food in my car except bagged groceries which I take inside right away.

He knows I have an eating disorder, it’s obvious and I was open about it early in our relationship. He’s always been supportive of me though. Helping me stick to my meal plan, encouraging to go to my appointments, and to eat more in a way that doesn’t piss me off. He’s great 

A lot of people don’t know but there are two types of anorexia, anorexia-r(restrictive) and anorexia-bp(binge purge.) both types are restrictive disorders except with mine an-bp, I also binge and purge(throw up, in my case.) 

I’ve always been very secretive about this aspect of my disorder as it’s the most emotionally exhausting and embarrassing part of it to me. I will buy food and eat it in the car, or eat while my bf isn’t home and then hide the trash or take it to a dumpster somewhere else. 

CW this next part is so gross I’m so sorry 

>!I normally purge into the toilet but lately I’ve been doing it so much I’m afraid I’ll clog the pipes. So I’ve been purging into gallon ziplock bags then triple bagging them in trash bags before taking them to the bin outside!<

I’m almost 100% certain my bf found one of the bags. He was trying to fit a broken coffee maker into the outside bin and he was out there for so long. I had forgotten that I’d put a bag in early today, so I just stupidly let him go out there. I should have took the coffee maker out myself, I really messed up. 

When he came back inside he was really quiet, he went to the bathroom and even when he came back out he was kind of standoffish. I acted like nothing was abnormal and now he’s playing video games in his office and I’m panicking in the living room.

I’m so disgusted with my behaviour. He wouldn’t even look at me. I can only imagine what he’s thinking. Helping someone with not eating enough is wildly different than finding your partners bag of vomit, fuck I’m such an idiot ",1,1734317886.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I’m on the fence on whether I like it or if it matches well with the couch and living room. The rug also serves a purpose of hiding the speaker cables for the rear speakers. 

I am open to other rug suggestions as well. 

Ignore the small table in the corner by the window with the awkwardly placed chairs. I am selling those so they will be gone soon. I also will replace the coffee table with a lift top one, but will be same color or similar.

The rug in the photo is from Istana. Just one I found on Amazon.

For the last 5 years, I've been using the [5cup Zojirushi](https://www.target.com/p/zojirushi-zutto-5-cup-coffee-maker-silver/-/A-79992499?sid=&ref=tgt_adv_xsp&AFID=google&fndsrc=tgtao&DFA=71700000012576704&CPNG=PLA_Appliances%2BShopping%7CAppliances_Ecomm_Home&adgroup=SC_Appliances_Coffee+Makers+%26+Accessories&LID=700000001170770pgs&LNM=PRODUCT_GROUP&network=g&device=c&location=9019676&targetid=pla-1439047010324&ds_rl=1246978&ds_rl=1247068&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAmfq6BhAsEiwAX1jsZx4TCcDsPbaY4X6z_fx8HYQ7Rio1VN9gTdJUpfzDO3u86CVlTDN0TRoCl4sQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), and I've enjoyed it. I have about 15 fluid ounces of coffee first thing in the morning, and that's it for the day.

When the Moccamasters were on sale, I wanted to get one as a gift to myself. Since I only have \~15 fluid ounces, I knew the one-cup would be too little, but the regular KBVG would make more than I need. That's why I settled on the KBTS because it seemed like a middle ground and closer to me using it and not wasting so much extra capacity.

Now, I'm second-guessing my purchase. Since I like to make my coffee machine to run while I feed the dog and then have the coffee right after, I don't keep the coffee sitting around long before I drink it so the negative of the hot plate burning the coffee I don't think is very applicable to me. I only realized after the sale ended and before I unboxed the KBTS, that the KBTS doesn't have a hot plate. After reading, I learned I should heat up the thermal carafe before I use it. This will take extra time in the morning.

Additionally, the Zojirushi is easy to clean, and I'd think the KBVG is similarly easy to clean. 

Can anyone share thoughts on my purchase given how I like to make/drink coffee? Was the KBTS instead of a KBVG a mistake?",1,1734317673.0,Moccamaster,10,0.67,False

Then I came across IC after a lot of research and feel like this is what I have. 

I did pelvic floor stretches and started working out and ate better. It went away!  I was normal for the first time in months!

Burning after urination, outside of urethra area and anal area. EXTREMELY uncomfortable when urine is concentrated - that’s when shit hits the fan for a couple of hours. Itching around urethra opening that comes and goes. I’m feeling uncomfortable most hours awake. I drink water in the middle of the night to avoid concentrated urine.

It's been my dream to try paw paw one day, especially because I love foraging and always see it in the foraging subreddit, but it's never been a realistic goal since grocery stores don't sell the fruit and I live in Canada (outside of the plant's growing range only the very tip of Ontario is habitable by the plant).

Today at the Christmas market, to my shock, a fruit and vegtable vendor was selling paw paws shipped from a farm down south. They sold small fruit boxes for 15$ (has like 4 fruit inside each box). I was telling my wife how I have always wanted to try and she said I should buy it, however, I was leaning to no because almost all the  fruit had gone soft and black, we are broke so we shouldn't drop 15$ on a container of fruit with a maximum one paw paw that's still good.

The vendor overheard my dilemma and my excitement to even see the fruit and he slipped me one of the still green paw paws and said ""Its okay, just take it, happy holidays"" I tried to offer paying part price or buying him a coffee or treat but he was insistant and said he just wanted to make someone's day.

I figured I’d post an update. 


I am still incredibly depressed. All the good things coming from this experience are overshadowed by my grief and mourning of a job I live and bitterness to my old managers. 


I wound up failing my pediatric final. I needed 80% to pass the class, and I bombed the final so badly I wound up with 79.5%  in the class. Before the final I was making an 86 or 87… the final happened after while I was so focused on this event. 

I am now having to retake that course, which is putting me an entire semester behind graduation. So now instead of being finished in May, I’ll graduate in December. 

Coincidentally that’s when my ineligibility for rehire expires. This area is owned by a healthcare monopoly. I want to work in a hospital ER upon graduation, but now I’m leaning toward a smaller hospital because I refuse to work under than management. 

I also sent in an appeal. I am pretty sure it goes to my old management so it won’t be upheld. However, I’m sending it over their heads after. 



Since we are majorly under a monopoly, that leaves my only current option being a longterm care facility. I had the job lined up before I resigned and had them reject my resignation and fire me. The DON knew this was a ‘maybe’ job for me. She and I knew one another and she knew I’d work hard and any hours available. I didn’t apply anywhere else because part of me still thinks I’ll wake up tomorrow and be going to my old job. 

Today was my very first day… let me tell you… holy shit I commend all of you: nurses, techs, social workers, etc., who’ve worked in longterm care. 

Today was day one and I have never been so BEAT in my life. I have never seen people work so damn hard. I went from feeding my last feeder’s breakfast to the first feeder’s lunch like it was nothing. Not to mention the changing, lack of help turning totals, etc., in every second that could’ve been a break but wound up being prioritizing these people who live in this facility. The beds were all different, and they didn’t have the same medical clean holds I’m used to. I don’t think I did a thing medical. The techs here don’t even do vitals. 

To the nurse, who worked as a tech today, who left during her own lunch to buy a resident her favorite coffee creamer… and to the tech who oriented me today, who loved and kissed a lady on the cheek every time she saw her…

Thank god for people like you. 

The members of this staff are outstanding people who care so much for these residents— I keep wanting to say patients. You can feel they love them like their family. 


I don’t know that I’ll stay in longterm care. It’s never been my plan. I didn’t think I’d ever work in one once I graduate. I believe this will be a good thing for my resume and a different thing to learn in the time I’m extending my school experience. I’ll still treat these precious people with all the love and care that is at my (idealist) idea of nursing. 

Screw the management who won’t speak up or defend their staff, who won’t hear a thing that doesn’t follow their agenda. 


Also, I talked to my dean. I was SO impressed by her. 
I told her the situation, even bringing up my barely failing score for the one class. 

I have been thinking for a minute, that having one class in the spring while adjusting to this brand new job is a blessing. I didn’t once ask her to change the grade or round up… because I’m so overwhelmed, I don’t think I’d be successful moving on with double my school load and a new job. 

I told her what had happened and let me tell you— I have never felt so supported by someone. Not only has nobody contacted her, but my dean barely even mentioned that incident once I explained it, told me if they DO contact her, they would be reaching out to ME before even responding, and she empathized with my situation. 

My doubts and fears subsided so much when she and I talked. I wept in my car after because  this was marking of the end of this horrible event…

… so now I can put it behind me. 

Send me the best vibes as I try to make it in longterm care. I want to do my best by these people and to show the people working how damn important they are. ",20,1734317006.0,nursing,2,0.92,False

I'll be traveling (solo) for about a week, from 1/14 - 1/22. Definitely a bucket list trip! I'm immersing myself in learning as much as I can about Hawaii (currently reading Michener's *Hawaii)*, and am very open to trying new things.

Some thoughts:

* With the exception of a few traditional tourist things (Pearl Harbor, Dole Plantation, a luau, etc.), I'd like to experience the islands as authentically as possible, eat where the locals eat, do what the locals do. But I am open to some other touristy things too (whale watching, shark cages, sky diving)
* I love experiencing local cuisine. Very excited about the fruit, seafood, coffee, etc
* I'm also all about small, local businesses, especially those with history or stories behind them
* I'm equally excited about off-the-beaten-path places no one usually goes to as I am historic sites and epic views
* I'm flying in and out of Honolulu. Other than that, where I go, what I see, where I stay, and how to get there is still all up in the air
* I'm training for a marathon in March. I'm thinking it would be awesome to do one of my long runs (\~13 - 15 miles) while I'm there, preferably on flat terrain 
* If I understand correctly, Hawaii is very friendly, but the gay scene isn't what you'd find in other major areas in terms of bars, clubs, bath houses, dark rooms, etc. 
* Still, I'd like to let my hair down a bit. . nude beaches, gay lodgings, whatever else there is. . .

  
So where should I go? What should I see, do, eat, etc.? Where should I stay and how do I get everywhere?

1hf94la,https://i.redd.it/69rwi2ifh47e1.png,"Monday, December 16, 2024 | Word of The Day ""Hey, hold on a second!"" - Have you ever experienced those moments that just make you stop and think? • [Click to Expand] ","# Pause and Reflect: The Profound Art of Momentary Awareness


Have you ever been in the middle of your usual routine—rushing to catch a train, scrolling mindlessly through your phone, or mechanically completing a work task—when suddenly, something shifts? A split second where the world seems to pause, and you're struck by an unexpected wave of awareness. That's the moment I want to explore: those brief, extraordinary instances that interrupt our autopilot and invite us to truly see.

These moments are like unexpected philosophical nudges, tiny interruptions in our carefully constructed narratives that demand we stop, breathe, and actually acknowledge our existence. They're not grand, dramatic revelations but subtle whispers that slip through the cracks of our daily consciousness. Think about it: you might be waiting in line at a coffee shop, and suddenly, the way sunlight catches the steam rising from someone's latte makes you acutely aware of the intricate beauty surrounding you.

What triggers these moments? Sometimes it's something seemingly insignificant—a bird landing on a windowsill, an overheard snippet of conversation, or the rhythm of raindrops against a window. Other times, it's more profound: a sudden realization of your own mortality, a brief connection with a stranger, or witnessing an act of unexpected kindness.

Philosophers have long been fascinated by these interruptions. They're not just random occurrences but potential gateways to deeper understanding. Henri Bergson, the French philosopher, talked about ""durée"" or pure duration—those moments when time feels different, when we're not just measuring seconds but experiencing them in their raw, unfiltered state. It's like time stretches and contracts, revealing layers of experience typically hidden beneath our routine perceptions.

Consider the last time you truly paused. Not just a physical pause, but a genuine moment of presence. Maybe it was during a walk when you suddenly noticed the intricate patterns of a leaf, or during a conversation when you realized the profound complexity of human connection. These moments are invitations—subtle calls to step outside our habitual thinking and engage with the world more authentically.

Interestingly, these philosophical interruptions often occur when we least expect them. They're not confined to meditation retreats or philosophical seminars but can ambush us in the most mundane settings. A crowded subway, a busy street corner, or your own living room can suddenly become a stage for profound realization. It's as if the universe has a sense of humor, choosing the most unexpected moments to nudge our consciousness.

But why are these moments so powerful? They function like reset buttons for our perception. In a world that constantly demands our attention—bombarding us with notifications, expectations, and endless to-do lists—these interruptions remind us that there's more to existence than productivity and achievement. They invite introspection, challenging us to question our assumptions and reconnect with a more authentic version of ourselves.

Psychologically, these moments are fascinating. They represent brief windows where our default mode network—the part of our brain responsible for mind-wandering and self-referential thinking—gets temporarily disrupted. Suddenly, we're not just thinking about ourselves in relation to past or future, but experiencing the pure, unfiltered now. Neuroscientists might describe this as a momentary state of heightened awareness, where our typical narrative-driven consciousness takes a backseat.

Think about children—they're masters at experiencing these moments naturally. A child can spend hours fascinated by a ladybug, completely absorbed in the present. As adults, we've trained ourselves to constantly analyze, categorize, and move on. These philosophical interruptions are essentially invitations to reclaim that childlike sense of wonder, to see the world with fresh, unencumbered eyes.

Cultural traditions have long recognized the value of such moments. Zen Buddhism, for instance, emphasizes mindfulness and being present—concepts that resonate deeply with these spontaneous philosophical interruptions. Meditation practices across various traditions are essentially structured attempts to create space for these very experiences that occasionally visit us unbidden.

The beauty of these moments lies in their unpredictability and brevity. They don't require grand gestures or elaborate setups. They're democratic in nature—available to anyone willing to be slightly more attentive, slightly more open to the subtle rhythms of existence. They remind us that philosophy isn't just an academic exercise confined to textbooks, but a living, breathing engagement with our immediate experience.

So the next time you feel that sudden pause, that unexpected interruption in your routine—don't dismiss it. Don't rush past it. Instead, pause. Breathe. Let yourself be curious. These moments are gifts, tiny portals offering glimpses into a more profound way of experiencing the world. They're invitations to step out of our narratives and into something more expansive, more alive.

In a world that constantly pulls us outward, these philosophical interruptions are gentle reminders to look inward, to marvel, to wonder. They whisper: ""Hey, hold on a second. There's more here than meets the eye.""

1hf8ye7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hf8ye7/using_time_correctly_diagnosing_adhd_ect/,"Using time correctly, diagnosing ADHD, ect.","Hey guys, I'm (29M) having a genuinely hard problem with sitting down to start and work on a big project. Whenever I have time to do it, I always end up opting out and doing many tasks around the house instead. This gives me a general sense of fulfillment however I always have a looming bigger task that seems to just coast by the wayside instead of being worked on. I was always severely nervous or distrusting when it came to any medication that had to do with focusing due to people around me getting hooked on them. I started eating healthier, I stopped drinking every day, I go to the gym, I pretty much am trying to get to as barebones as possible so I can try and figure out what my body actually needs. Aside from a drink here and there, or smoking pot at night to get some sleep, I have genuinely progressed with my health these last 6 months and I am proud of that. Now that I have gotten to a point that I am close to considering that it is a chemical issue, I keep wondering if there is something else I am missing or something I do not know about that would be able to help me instead of getting a prescription that would end up me possibly leaning into it once I realize it is helping.

Some context, maybe this will help:  
My dad was always a very heavy drinker, I am addicted to caffeine (just coffee unless its a late night and I need a red bull), cigs, and since I stopped drinking it has been sugar later on into the night.

I am a standup comedian who in my personal opinion has been doing well in his local scene. I am not a headliner by any means however my peers do consistently and positively bring up my work ethic for the craft. I do not enjoy much of the positive feedback I receive because I know how much time I genuinely waste instead of sitting down nose to the grindstone and writing (big project I have going on right now is I want to begin writing a low budget movie I would LOVE to figure out how to make.)

It has gotten to the point where I obsess over the time I waste, to the point where I end up trying to count how many minutes I wasted today. I am actively thinking right now about me wasting time writing this in the event that it goes nowhere instead of writing which I probably would put off doing other things anyway.

I guess my ultimate questions are:  
Does anyone or has anyone faced this and came up with some answers on how to fix their attention issues?  
At what point is my fascination with wanting to be obsessed at all time about writing unhealthy BOTH before I figure out how to do it all the time AND while I'm just bullying myself into not doing anything at all?

I take it to heart when I see people in my field work harder than me and I would like nothing more than to figure out how to just work without being so easily distracted or willing to do smaller tasks with immediate gratification.

I do really try to work my ass off, every day or night I have off I do whatever possible to put into my want of being a working comic. This is the road I want to go down regardless of if I become rich or famous, I just want to be the best I can be and make people laugh. The rest will come. I am in no rush and have no intention on pissing away the years of me learning and coming up. I did that in my 20s, I do not regret it, but I want to figure out how to get my head right so I can work on the things I want to work on.

Thank you. I am keenly aware that this career choice, that people have way bigger problems, and that on this page this is not of as much importance as some of the stories people post. I hope to find somewhat of a lead to guide me in possibly figuring this all out. Thanks guys, I hope you have an awesome holiday.",1,1734315969.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I’m new to my job as a bar and restaurant manager and he’s upset he didn’t get the job so he’s been targeting me and trying to get me in trouble/fired. 

A little back story, I just got promoted maybe 2 months ago and am currently on probation (for the first 90 days of the job). I have been at my current company for 2 years and have worked my way up by busting my a55 and putting in the work. I’m a 23 F and my supervisor who is giving me the trouble is a 53M. Both previous managers have also faced issues with him but nothing this bad and nothing came of it since they “did not have the time to deal with it”. 

A few examples of things he has done within the past 2 months of me being promoted:

Sexually harassing 2 female employees 
Lied about his whereabouts while on shift 
Found asleep on the job 
Urinated in a coffee cup in our liquor storage room (and yes he left it there) 
Has been suspected to come into work drunk 
Created a hostile work environment (has been that way for months now) 
Has displayed sexist and ageist many risks and made comments as such 



It’s gotten to the point where everyone hate coming into work with him since they know it’s going to be a crappy shift where he rules with an iron fist and flaunts his power. All these issues have arose recently with me since I no longer allow him to get away with anything. Oh you’re standing around and intimidating the staff, go stock the liquor cage. Talking on the phone? Start breaking down this well and scrubbing the floors. 

I ended up getting HR involved and there’s a current pending investigation because I came to HR. Ever since then he has been calling out, writing sickening emails and trying to place the blame on me for “stomach issues” and “not wanting to work without me without another manager present” and finally “needing to be on medication to even work with me”. 

I need advice on how to handle this. He’s acting out of malice and I’m desperate to get rid of him, any advice?

My aunt; we'll call her sharon; always pops over unannounced after being told to chill out and stay home since I recently had a baby and am getting the nursing routine down. She thought we were kidding and she ALWAYS barges through the front door when I'm trying to feed my child in the living room. When she sees what I am doing she will automatically make a condescending remark and complain that she doesn't want to see my tits everytime she's over and that I should either go to my bedroom or cover up.. mind you she doesn't live with us. Anyway after she says this she goes to the kitchen and makes herself a pot of coffee and uses a shit ton of creamer. Now I'm not back to work but my husband and mom work but we just scrape by and creamer is one of our indulgence buys. Well one day Sharon asked to hold the baby (who was in his crib sleeping) to feed him a bottle of the breast milk i was currently pumping but she was still getting over a cold so I said ""no because you're sick so absolutely not."" She got SOOOOO offended saying I'm trying to ""hog the baby"" and that I need to share and that how is she supposed to bond with him if he's always with mommy. And that I need to stop being a helicopter mom and get off my high horse. After saying this she stormed off to the kitchen and I heard something go down the drain then heard the trash can lid open. I walked into then kitchen to put my extra breast milk into the glass container in the fridge and seen a empty glass jar on the counter. All the while Sharon has a malicious smirk on her face over her coffee cup so I ask her ""why is there a glass jar there?"" She responds ""well I didn't know how old that milk was (previous days pump) so I dumped it to save you time. Oh and also you're out of creamer"" then she walked off. Now I have a decent amount of fat in my milk and curiosity got the best of me one day so I tasted my milk and it was kinda sweet so that gave me an idea. After she left I went into the garbage can to retrieve the empty creamer container, washed it out and proceeded to use THAT as my new breastmilk container with just a few drops of pure vanilla extract to make it smell like the vanilla creamer we use (dont worry i didnt give it to baby). We got more creamer but I put THAT into pint glass jars with a date on them. And wouldn't you know it the next time she was over same old shit different day makes rude remarks about how they make formula for a reason so family can bond with the babies, makes a pot of coffee and uses the ""creamer"". She drank ALLL of the ""creamer"" there was a good 16oz and said ""that creamer must have been getting old the fat started to separate i had to shake it up. Where do you get that creamer it's my favorite"". I looked her straight in the eye and grabbed my tits and said ""the local BOOBERY. I'm so happy you liked it because now I understand why little man can't get enough"" the look on her face as she ran for the bathroom... 🤌🏻 chefs kiss. Needless to say she doesn't come over as often, doesn't make rude remarks about breastfeeding and she now leaves my coffee creamer alone. So AITA? If so I'll live with it because the justice was served ",123,1734315384.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,33,0.97,False
