In the end I was constantly fatigued, could not focus on work or anything, was demotivated to do anything, procrastinated a lot at work, could not get up in the morning. Actually I was a wreck. So I switched to freebase nicotine 4.5mg. It worked for the first couple of weeks. 

I had more energy and it was much easier to get up in the morning. I could do more work in the office and all was great. But soon the situation got worse and then I was the same as using nicsalts...

I then decided to go completely decaf. Stopped all sorts of caffeine intake, no chocolate or beverages containing caffeine whatsoever. Again, the first 3 weeks were great, more energy and all that stuff...

But now again, I feel lethargic and all that bad stuff. How can this be? My switch to freebase was also motivated to quit easier but I am not quite sure what is the culprit here. Also my hands are ice cold lately, showing bad blood circulation. I usually had this while drinking coffee. But I cant imagine that 4.5mg of freebase nic could cause such constriction in blood flow. 

Any advice or just quit everything alltogether? ",1,1747296778.0,QuitVaping,0,1.0,False

# Desmond Belmont had an affair.

# As she stood outside the CEO's office, Beatrice Lawson felt like she couldn't breathe, the air around her becoming thinner and thinner.

# She was glued to the spot, as if frozen in time.

# After what felt like an eternity, she finally summoned the strength to knock on the door.

# ""Come in.""

# Desmond answered, his deep voice almost a growl.

# Beatrice gripped the papers with one hand and pushed the door open with the other. 

# Flames of anger were still burning inside her before she entered.

# But when she stepped in, she immediately masked the rage threatening to explode. 

# With a forced smile, Beatrice walked straight to Desmond and asked, ""Are you busy now? Please sign these papers. It's urgent.""

Without waiting for him to respond, she slid the papers in front of him.

Desmond had just returned from a business trip to Slideland that morning.

The moment he stepped into the office, he buried himself in work.

The mountain of papers on the table had already given him a headache. So, he signed the papers Beatrice handed over without hesitation, his handsome face clouded with exhaustion.

""Thanks."" 

With that, Beatrice took over the signed papers and asked, “Are you coming home for dinner tonight?”

""I have plans tonight. Don't wait for me,"" he muttered without looking up, his voice flat.

""Alright, I'll head out then.""

Beatrice turned and walked out, her grip on the papers tightening.

Once she was out of his sight, her smile twisted into a sneer.

As she passed the lounge next to Desmond's office, a faint noise caught her ear. It was like the soft thud of a small animal jumping off a bed.

When she scanned the room, the scattered snack packages and the half-drunk milk on the coffee table caught her eyes first.

Then it was the pink high heel laying on the ground…

At that moment, everything clicked into place. Her heart sank.

Beatrice returned to her office.

When she slumped into her chair, she let out a long sigh, looking defeated and drained.

She then pulled a file from the stack of papers Desmond had just signed.

It was a divorce agreement.

Memories from the past popped up in her head as her finger traced his signature on the paper.

Back when Desmond was determined to spend the rest of his life with Beatrice, his mother, Autumn Belmont, poured cold water on the idea.

She told Beatrice that men weren't as loyal as they sounded. But Beatrice turned a deaf ear to it, saying that Desmond wasn't one of them.

Now, thinking back, she realized she was so wrong. 

Desmond did cheat on her, and he even believed he kept it under wrap well. Also, he quite enjoyed the thrill and excitement the affair had brought him.

He not only went on the business trip with the mistress, but also allowed her to show up in the company.

A while later, Beatrice snapped out of it.

She took a picture of the divorce agreement and sent a message to Autumn: \[He signed it.\]

A week ago, Beatrice made a deal with Autumn.

Autumn demanded that Beatrice bring up the divorce and never reveal their secret marriage to the public.

In exchange, Beatrice asked for a hundred million dollars in compensation.

Beatrice made up her mind. 

In one month, she'd make sure Desmond was out of her life for good.

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.

Beatrice shoved the divorce agreement into the drawer and replied, ""Come in.""

Roland Walker, Desmond's assistant, entered, carrying a green velvet box.

""Mrs. Belmont, Mr. Belmont asked me to deliver this to you."" 

With that, he placed the box on her desk.

Beatrice opened it without much thought, and a set of expensive diamond jewelry came into her view.

Yet, as she stared at it, the first thing that came to her mind was an image of a short-haired girl in a dimly lit hotel room.

Wearing a bathrobe, the girl was fiddling with the very same necklace. The hickeys on her neck and chest stood out. And the bed behind her was a total mess.

Disgust washed over her as the scene kept playing in her head.

""Thanks, Roland."" 

Still, Beatrice kept her cool and managed these words.

She looked up at him with eyes that could freeze anyone in their tracks.

Roland felt his spine chill under her gaze.

He babbled, ""Mr. Belmont picked this out himself. There's only one set in the world.""

Too bad, she wasn't his one and only now. And Beatrice couldn't care less about it.

At the thought, she wore a thin smile. ""Oh, how touching. He's so busy, yet he remembered to buy me a gift.""

Roland hesitated, his stomach turning. He was wondering if Beatrice had found out about Desmond's affair.

Breaking out in a cold sweat, he quickly left the office.

Beatrice stared at the jewelry, disgust written all over her face. 

Then she took out her phone, snapped a picture, and sent it to a second-hand luxury goods dealer along with a message. 

\[Sell this for me and donate the money to children with intellectual disability.\]

\*\*\*

At five o'clock in the afternoon, Beatrice made her way to the parking lot.

She walked to her car, ready to get in, but a casual glance across the lot caught her eye. 

A car was running on the opposite side.

Through the window, she saw Desmond sitting in the backseat, with a pretty young girl next to him. 

""Mr. Belmont!"" Roland shouted, slamming on the brakes in panic.

The next second, Beatrice locked eyes with Desmond.

Chapter 2 Eight Years of Fun

His eyes were deep while hers were cold.

Instantly, the air got tense.

When the girl saw Beatrice, instead of distancing herself from Desmond, she boldly wrapped her arms around his neck and whispered something in his ear.

Beatrice felt a sharp pain in her chest.

She quickly looked away, got into her car, and drove off without sparing another glance at them.

Not long after arriving home, the sound of a car pulling up reached her ears.

She stood before the glass cabinet in her walk-in closet, taking off her necklace when suddenly, a tall, strong body pressed up against her from behind. 

Quickly, she was surrounded by the familiar scent of his cologne.

Propping his hands on the cabinet, Desmond leaned in and asked, ""Are you angry?""

""Yes. I'm so angry right now that I could kill someone. You'd better be careful,"" Beatrice replied, her tone bland.

Without sparing him a glance, she placed the necklace back in its case.

Desmond fell silent for a moment before speaking again, ""The Fairfax family wants to partner with us on the ZenithStar Project. I've been in contact with Quentin Fairfax lately. Ms. Fairfax is his sister.""

""What? You're telling me that if you don't entertain Ms. Fairfax, Mr. Fairfax won't cooperate with you?""

""Beatrice, I'm trying to explain. Stop with the sarcasm!""

""No need to explain."" Beatrice turned to face him, her eyes sharp and cold, as though she could see through his soul. 

She went on, ""Desmond, if you're tired of me, just tell me. I'll divorce you so that you can marry your new love.""

Desmond's face darkened instantly. ""What did you say?""

""I said... we can divorce. I'm okay with it."" Beatrice sighed, her voice steady.

She shoved him aside and tried to leave, but he yanked her back with force.

Desmond gripped her chin and warned, ""Don't you even think about it.""

This time, Beatrice stayed silent, not in the mood for further explanation.

Not only had she thought about it, she had already taken action. She was so over Desmond.

Late at night, Desmond left the house after getting a call.

When he was on the phone earlier, Beatrice happened to hear their conversation.

Apparently, it was his mistress that summoned him away, and she seemed to be crying.

The next morning, Beatrice's lawyer and close friend, who was handling the divorce, sent her a screenshot. 

It was Desmond's girlfriend's latest post on Instagram.

It had a photo of two hands clasped together, one big, and one small. The caption read: \[Feeling each other's heartbeat at sunrise.\]

Beatrice immediately recognized the large hand. It was Desmond's.

She sat there, frozen, her hand still clutching her cup of water.

After what seemed like forever, she came to her senses and placed the cup down.

As she put down the cup on the table with a clink, she felt as if something deep down cracked. 

For the next several days, Desmond didn't come home.

They only saw each other in business meetings. He sat at the head of the table while she and the other executives sat to either side. 

During those meetings, their eyes barely met.

And Beatrice didn't go to his office to see him.

In her spare time, she was busy looking for a new house. She began to sell off all the gifts he had ever given her over the years. 

Those anniversary gifts, birthday presents, Valentine's tokens, wedding gifts, and even her wedding ring.

She didn't want any of it. Now that she was to get rid of him, she certainly didn't want his garbage.

\*\*\*

In the evening, Lillian Monroe invited Beatrice to a club.

It was nearly eleven o'clock, so Beatrice wasn't in the mood for it.

But she would leave the Summit Group after the divorce. Plus, she needed to make some connections to start her own business.

Eventually, she decided to join Lillian.

The moment she entered the club, she spotted Lillian.

""Lillian, I can manage it on my own. What brings you here?"" Beatrice asked.

Lillian linked arms with her as they walked toward the elevator. ""I was worried you'd get lost. It's your first time being here, right?""

Beatrice nodded.

After they headed upstairs, Lillian led her into a large private room. 

In the middle of the room was a screen that divided the space in half.

As they entered, Beatrice noticed there were a lot of people on the other side of the screen. 

Lillian didn't lead her that way, though. Instead, she gestured for Beatrice to sit on the side where there was already a woman sitting. 

Beatrice recognized her, who looked to be one of Desmond's friends' girlfriend.

The woman seemed to recognize Beatrice as well. When their eyes met, her expression turned a bit awkward, but she still forced a smile.

After Beatrice took off her coat and sat down, Lillian excused herself and left.

As Beatrice took a sip of her drink, the sound of loud laughter from the other side caught her attention. 

She hadn't expected that they would shift the topic and start talking about her.

""Desmond doesn't even bring Beatrice to our hangouts anymore.""

""Well, duh. He's all about Ms. Fairfax now. Man, she's a real hottie. He takes her everywhere. He's definitely into her.""

""Guess Desmond's tastes have changed after all these years.""

""Even if Beatrice is gorgeous, after eight years, anyone would get tired.""

""Beatrice is such a fool. She stuck around all these years and ended up with nothing. Now that Desmond's done with her, maybe I can make a move. She's got an amazing body, and I've been eyeing her for ages.""

\*\*\*

Beatrice's eyes turned icy as she listened to their words.

She recognized their voices. They were Desmond's friends, who always acted so polite and friendly when they saw her.

The woman sitting next to Beatrice got so antsy that she didn't dare to meet Beatrice's gaze. 

When Beatrice stood up, she thought Beatrice was about to run for her life.

To her surprise, Beatrice didn't.

She cleared her throat, picked up her drink, and walked toward the other side of the room. 

Leaning casually against the screen, Beatrice chimed in, ""Come on, guys, you can't say it like that. When Desmond and I were together, he was just a clueless virgin. Haven't I enjoyed him for eight whole years?""

The room went dead silent.

Everyone sitting on the couch stared at her in shock.

At that moment, two people happened to walk into the room.

They then shifted their gaze to the two newcomers, awkwardness creeping over their faces.

Chapter 3 Have Fun with Your Girlfriend

Desmond stood behind Beatrice, looking grim. 

Beatrice noticed people glancing over her shoulder, so she turned to see what was up. 

Spotting Desmond, she raised an eyebrow.

Then, she glanced back at the short-haired girl sitting in the corner of the sofa. 

Earlier, when Beatrice arrived, that girl had been lounging with her legs crossed, twirling her hair, and wearing a smug smile. 

But now, the smile was gone. Her face was ashen, and she glared at Beatrice.

Turned out, the two of them had shown up in gatherings like this as a couple more than once. They didn't even bother to keep their relationship a secret.

Desmond strode forward.

The others snapped back to reality and quickly tried to smooth things over.

""Beatrice, I'm sorry. We were talking nonsense.""

""Beatrice, there is nothing going on between Desmond and Ms. Fairfax.""

""Beatrice, please don't take it to heart.""

Unable to stand the farce any longer, Desmond grabbed Beatrice's wrist, ready to drag her out.

The next second, Beatrice splashed her drink over his face.

Everyone was dumbfounded, having no idea why Beatrice had the guts to do so.

Beatrice smiled sweetly and said in a gentle tone, ""Desmond, go on and have fun with your girlfriend. I'll be out of your hair.""

As she spoke, she lowered her head to pry at his hand.

Desmond's face got uglier. He hoisted her onto his shoulder and marched out.

Along the hallway, Beatrice struggled desperately, trying to break free.

Just then, the elevator door opened.

After Desmond entered the elevator, Beatrice noticed there was another man inside.

His black leather shoes were well made, and the black trousers hugged his long legs properly. The man had his hands hung at his sides, each finger looking like a finely sculpted work of art.

By the time Desmond exited the elevator, Beatrice couldn't help but look up. And she happened to meet a pair of deep, penetrating eyes.

Embarrassed, she covered her face with her hand and looked down.

\*\*\*

Once outside the club, Desmond threw Beatrice into the back seat of the car and climbed in himself.

Dizzy and disoriented, Beatrice struggled for a while before sitting properly. 

She felt like she was on the verge of having a concussion, having been hung upside down for so long and then tossed into the car.

Desmond fetched a wet wipe and wiped his face.

Beatrice's sharp eyes caught sight of something behind the tissue box. It looked like a condom. 

Then she heard Desmond questioning, ""What are you doing here? Wanna catch me cheating on you on the spot?""

Ignoring him, Beatrice opened the car door to get out.

The car felt way too filthy to her.

But Desmond pulled her back, shouting, ""Beatrice! Where the hell are you going, huh? Are you done yet?”

""I just wanna go home,"" Beatrice responded, her breathing hitching.

Desmond called over Roland, who was waiting by the club's entrance, to drive.

On the way, neither of them spoke. 

Beatrice tried to sit as far away from Desmond as possible. Her face was pale as if she might vomit at any moment.

When they arrived home, she got out of the car immediately.

She rushed to the kitchen and gulped down a whole glass of ice water before she could regain her composure.

And when she left the kitchen, Desmond was already sitting in the living room.

Beatrice went over and sat down beside him.

Again, the suffocating silence loomed over.

Minutes later, Desmond broke the ice, saying, ""I went to the club for a business negotiation. Yet, there you were, stirring things up. This is so embarrassing! Why did you have to act out like a stupid shrew?""

""Anything else?"" Beatrice replied calmly.

""Put away your suspicious mind if you still want to be with me. I don't have time to deal with your nonsense.""

""Fine. Is that all?""

Desmond frowned. He went on, ""Beatrice, you're annoying whenever you make a scene. You know that?""

But soon, he wouldn't be annoyed by her.

With that in mind, Beatrice stood up and walked upstairs, a sneer on her face.

Desmond felt even more irritated by her sneer. He sat in the living room for a while before going upstairs to their bedroom.

Beatrice had already drifted into sleep at that time. 

After taking a shower, he lay down beside her.

In the dark, Beatrice had her back to him. She nudged herself to the bedside, trying to avoid his touch.

Still, Desmond wrapped his arms around her and forced her into his embrace, his actions laced with anger.

He was tall and strong. Hence, there was nothing she could do to get rid of him.

The whole night, she was stuck with him.

The next morning, Beatrice prepared breakfast only for herself.

When Desmond came downstairs, he saw her sitting alone at the dining table, eating bread. 

Just when he was about to leave, he took a turn and returned to the dining room.

Leaning close to her ear, he softened his tone and said, ""This weekend, we'll hang out by the beach for two days. Just the two of us.""

While drinking her milk, Beatrice snorted. She no longer believed his promises.

Just as she had predicted, Desmond canceled the plan again the day before Saturday. He said he had to fly to Hexington for business

That didn't stir anything within Beatrice.

It had been ages since the last time they had a proper meal together and accompanied each other like normal couples.

Desmond had warned Beatrice to never bring up divorce. But in fact, he no longer cared about her. Even if she vanished one day, he'd probably wouldn't be looking for her.

Ironically, Desmond himself didn't seem to notice any of the signs.

On weekends, Beatrice collected her books from the bookshelf and packed them into a suitcase, taking them to her new house.

While she was sorting the books, Autumn, who rarely contacted her, called her.

Beatrice picked up the call and said politely, ""Mrs. Autumn Belmont, hello.""

Autumn replied in an arrogant tone, ""Come back for a visit. We'll sign a contract about the deal we made.""

""Is that really necessary?""

""Yes.""

""Fine, I'll come over this afternoon.""

""Come at noon.""

""Alright.""

Beatrice agreed, thinking she had nothing else to do.

Meanwhile, Autumn stood on the second floor, watching with delight as Madeline Fairfax strolled through the garden with Desmond.

She was resolute to make Beatrice realize that Madeline and Desmond were a couple made in heaven.

Chapter 4 Triangle Love

Beatrice arrived at Belmont Manor at about 11:40 a.m.

The Belmont family's butler, Cullen Henderson, was very surprised to see her.

He knew a guest was coming, but he had not expected it to be Beatrice. 

The thought that Desmond was playing Gomoku with Madeline in the living room made him break into a nervous sweat.

Only a handful of people knew about Desmond and Beatrice's marriage. Besides their parents, only Roland and a few servants of the Belmont family were aware of it.

""Mrs. Belmont, please come with me.""

Cullen, following Autumn's orders, led the way reluctantly.

Before they reached the living room, they heard Madeline's sweet, coquettish voice. 

""I won again, Desmond! Did you let me win on purpose?""

Beatrice halted in her tracks.

Her mind went blank for a moment, but she soon understood what was going on.

With a snort, she entered the room.

She came here to take her books, so she didn't wear any makeup today. And she dressed casually. Clad in a loose white blouse and jeans, she had her shiny long hair tied in a ponytail.

Even so, she looked breathtaking and radiant with her sparkling eyes and her cherry-like lips.

There was surprise in Desmond's eyes when he saw Beatrice.

""What are you…"" He asked.

But before he could finish, Beatrice cut him off, ""Your mother asked me to come. Wait. Aren't you supposed to be in Hexington? How come you're here?""

She sounded calm, yet her tone carried sarcasm.

Awkwardness flashed across his face as Desmond heard that.

Madeline, seated on the sofa, got up and approached Beatrice. 

She reached out her hand provocatively, greeting, ""Hello, I'm Madeline Fairfax.""

Beatrice totally ignored her, not even sparing her a glance.

At that moment, Autumn showed up.

She looked at Beatrice, then took Madeline's hand and said amiably, ""Madeline, are you having fun today? Just make yourself at home.""

After that, she introduced Beatrice to Madeline, ""This is Beatrice Lawson. She works at Desmond's company. I have some matters to discuss with her.""

Autumn introduced Beatrice as one of Desmond's employees. Everyone present knew she was his wife, though.

Clearly, Autumn did it on purpose.

On the one hand, it showed that she didn't approve of Beatrice. On the other hand, she was reassuring Madeline that Beatrice wouldn't come in the way even if she stole Desmond from her.

Madeline lifted her head proudly. ""So, she's just an employee.""

Beatrice didn't look at Madeline or Autumn. She simply fixed her gaze on Desmond's face, trying to read his expression.

Sadly, he maintained indifferent all along, not even bothering to defend her.

He knew exactly what his mom meant by that. Still, he did nothing about it. He simply didn't care about Beatrice's feelings.

""Mrs. Autumn Belmont, didn't you say you want to talk to me? How about we discuss it right here?"" Beatrice asked, looking toward Autumn.

""Let's talk another day. Since you're here today, stay for lunch,"" Autumn replied.

""I'll skip the lunch. I've got other things to do."" 

With that, Beatrice turned around and was about to leave.

Autumn scolded, ""I told you to stay for lunch. What kind of attitude is that? Have you no manners?""

Turning back, Beatrice stared at Autumn calmly for quite a while.

Then she uttered, ""Fine, I'll stay for lunch. But don't regret it.""

After that, she sat by the table.

Madeline sat down right next to Desmond. She held his arm and said, ""Desmond, let's continue our Gomoku game.""

Desmond pulled his arm back and glanced at Beatrice.

""Ms. Lawson, do you know how to play Gomoku?"" Madeline asked, also shifting her gaze to her.

Beatrice glimpsed at the chessboard on the table. 

The board was set with exquisite pieces. Yet, although the board and pieces were of fine quality, the moves played were embarrassingly amateurish.

It was obvious that Desmond was deliberately giving way to Madeline.

A cold smile was playing at her lips as Beatrice looked up at Desmond. ""Yes, I do. Ms. Fairfax, care to join me?""

A flash of irritation crossed Desmond's eyes, his look filled with warning.

Confidently, Madeline neatly rearranged the pieces on the board. ""Ms. Lawson, which piece do you choose, the black one or the white one?""

Beatrice grabbed the black pieces. ""The black ones, please. It's my color.""

Desmond watched her coldly.

With gritted teeth, Madeline hurriedly made the first move.

After a few moves, Autumn noticed that Madeline was playing with strategy, while Beatrice moved her pieces randomly.

Autumn had always favored Madeline. 

Without getting the full picture of the game, she shot Desmond a meaningful glance, as if telling him, ""See? This is what a decent rich lady should be like.""

But Desmond just turned a blind eye to it.

Minutes went by, and they were in the heat of the game.

Every time Madeline thought she was about to win, Beatrice cleverly blocked her.

And so, Madeline's mood was on a roller coaster. She got a bit anxious.

However, the thought that the two of them were still in a stalemate made her feel better.

Still, she did not want the game to end in a draw.

""Your turn now,"" Beatrice reminded Madeline.

At the border, Madeline had already set a trap. With one more move, she could declare victory.

Putting on an untroubled façade, Madeline made a move and then stared at Beatrice nervously, afraid she might block her again.

When Beatrice failed to notice the trap and placed her piece elsewhere, Madeline triumphantly shouted, ""I won!""

Autumn immediately applauded.

But the next second, they realized they were so wrong about the result when Beatrice was collecting the pieces.

Turned out, she had won the game long before Madeline hoorayed for her own ""victory.""

Instantly, Autumn's and Madeline's faces turned ghastly pale.

Chapter 5 He Looks Familiar

Beatrice picked up the chess pieces and put them back in the box. 

In Gomoku, one move could seal the deal, but Madeline just couldn't admit defeat. 

To save her pride, she bent the rules. 

""You reached five in a row first. But, so what? I also got five in a row. I won, too!""

Then she made another move in the board.

Amusement, mixed with disbelief, was on Beatrice's face when she looked at Madeline as if she was nothing more than a fool. 

After a moment, she replied, ""So, by your logic, I should keep playing too, right?"" 

With that, she smoothly moved a piece and called another check.

In the next few minutes, Beatrice moved almost every piece, leaving Madeline with no escape. 

Madeline's face turned an alarming shade of blue as she yelled for a rematch.

They played a few more rounds. 

Sometimes, Beatrice intentionally led her into her traps while other times, she ended the match swiftly in just a few moves. 

Madeline could tell that Beatrice was messing with her.

Eventually, Madeline burst into tears.

""Enough!""

Desmond snatched the chess box from Beatrice's hand, his expression dark and menacing.

Knowing Desmond had her back, Madeline immediately threw herself into his arms, crying out loud as if Beatrice had been bullying her.

Desmond comforted her in a soothing voice. 

Autumn also joined in the commotion, chiding Beatrice, ""It's just a game. Do you have to take it so seriously? You're so petty!""

Beatrice paid them no heed.

She fixed her gaze on Desmond's face, feeling like she didn't know him anymore.

He had been so wonderful and marvelous to her before, but now, he was nothing but a cheater. 

Beatrice decided to let him be. After all, they would be officially divorced in twenty days.

She then tossed the pieces on the board, stood up, and left.

A few drops of blood fell onto the board as she tossed the pieces. Only once she stepped outside did she notice her fingers felt cold. 

Glancing down, she noticed her palm was bleeding. She must have dug her nails in too hard earlier.

""Beatrice!""

Desmond called out to her, his voice betraying a rare trace of nervousness.

He got up, ready to go after her, but Madeline wrapped herself around his waist, sobbing even harder.

Beatrice walked out of Belmont Manor. 

On her way home, Desmond kept calling her, but she didn't even think twice before blocking his number. 

Then she shot a message to Autumn: ""Give me 150 million dollars! Not a penny less, or I'll make you pay!""

Autumn almost fainted from fury when she read it.

\*\*\*

While Beatrice was driving, it started raining. 

The drizzle fell gently, and her thoughts drifted just as softly. 

Suddenly, a yellow motorcycle zipped by. 

Startled, she slammed on the brakes.

With a deafening bang, a huge jolt hit from behind, and her head slammed into the steering wheel. 

Pain shot through her forehead. 

She looked up, her vision turning blood-red. Quickly, she grabbed a tissue to wipe the blood from her eyes.

She'd been rear-ended, and that yellow motorcycle had disappeared without a trace.

Someone knocked on her car door.

And Beatrice rolled down the window.

Outside stood a man nearing fifty. 

With his glasses on, he looked kind and gentle.

Holding a black umbrella, he said apologetically, ""Hi, Miss. Sorry for rear-ending your car. We'll be responsible for it. Well, my boss is in a hurry right now. Could we exchange contact information? You can list the damages, and we will surely compensate you.""

""Let's just let the police handle it,"" Beatrice answered a bit impatiently.

She had been in a bad mood long way back. Now that she was shocked twice, her anger was about to explode.

She pushed open the car door, got out, and walked to the back. 

There, she saw the rear of her car dented by the Bentley behind her. Frowning, she took photos of it and then called the police.

Seeing her resolve, the man returned to his car and reported to his boss, ""Mr. Crowley, the lady refuses a private settlement. What do you think?""

It was raining heavier at that moment.

The windshield wipers swept away the rain from the glass, only for new droplets to quickly form.

Sitting in the backseat, the gentleman peeked at the woman outside.

She was pressing the wound on her forehead with one hand while holding her phone with the other.

Frustration washed over her, and so did the rain.

Her white blouse was soaked. Raindrops clung to her thick eyelashes, and then landed on her rosy lips.

""Mr. Crowley?"" Gordon Wills called softly.

Snapping out of it, the gentleman gazed down at his watch and addressed, ""Killian Hawke is on his way. I'm leaving now. You handle this matter.""

""Alright, Mr. Crowley.""

Beatrice returned to her car.

Soon, the police arrived at the scene, followed by a silver Maybach.

Both vehicles stopped almost at the same time.

At the sight, Beatrice exited her vehicle and walked over.

Seconds later, she saw a tall and strong man get out of the Maybach.

The man had this elegant and aloof vibe. His skin was sun-kissed, his eyes deep and penetrating.

Sensing her gaze, he cast a brief, cool glance her way. Warning was evident in his sharp eyes.

For some reason, Beatrice felt like she had met him before…

""Give it to her,"" the man said, handing the suit jacket draped over his arm to Gordon. 

Then, without hesitation, he got into the Maybach.

Gordon rushed over to Beatrice and told her, ""Miss, your clothes are soaked. You might want to put this on.""

Beatrice glanced down and noticed her white blouse was sticking to her skin, even showing the outline of her bra.

Embarrassed, she took the jacket and slipped it on. 

""Thanks,"" she mumbled. 

By the time Gordon was talking to the police, the Maybach had already taken off, cutting through the rain and fog. 

And Beatrice only caught a quick glimpse of the man's profile. 

The jacket still carried his lingering warmth, with a pleasant woody scent that chased away the chill of the rain.

The police soon came up with a resolution both parties agreed on, and they swapped contact info. 

Gordon offered to go with her to the hospital for her forehead injury, but Beatrice politely turned him down. 

By then, she'd cooled off a bit. 

Thinking back that she might have been rude before, she apologized, saying it was just her bad mood, and it had nothing to do with them. 

""I'll get the jacket cleaned and sent back to you,"" she promised.

Gordon accepted her apology. He knew his boss's temper. He might not want the jacket back, but Gordon agreed anyway.

Later on, Beatrice headed to the hospital alone. 

Meanwhile, Desmond couldn't reach her by phone. 

All sorts of terrible thoughts filled his mind as he watched the pouring rain outside. 

Just then, he got the news that Beatrice had been in an accident.

Chapter 6 You Scared the Hell Out of Me

When the doctor was treating Beatrice's wound, the door was pushed open.

The next second, a handsome man stormed in, anger written all over his face.

His abrupt invasion startled the doctor. 

Turning her head, Beatrice glanced at him and said to the doctor, ""Don't worry, he's my... boss.""

She had meant to say ""husband,"" but in the end, she changed her mind.

Desmond felt as though something was caught in his throat, leaving him momentarily speechless. 

He walked up to the doctor and asked, ""She's not seriously hurt, is she?""

""It's just a small wound. Nothing to worry about.""

After finishing tending to Beatrice's wound, the doctor left the room.

With a ""thank you"", Beatrice also walked out.

Desmond followed closely behind her. 

When Beatrice was at the counter, ready to pay the bill, he stepped in and paid it. Later, when it was time to pick up the medicine, he again did it for her, acting like a devoted husband.

Beatrice couldn't be bothered to say another word to him.

After leaving the hospital, she lowered her head, about to call an Uber. 

To her surprise, Desmond snatched her phone, wrapped an arm around her shoulder, and dragged her away.

He shoved her inside his car, and then climbed into the driver's seat.

As he slammed the door shut, the noises outside vanished in an instant.

The air inside the car was tense, though.

""You blocked my number. And now, you got injured. Is this one of the sick ways you have to punish me?""

Desmond snapped, his face masked in rage and weariness.

A bit stunned, Beatrice gazed at his darkened face and burst into laughter.

She had been feeling quite down, but his words managed to tickle her.

Never in her life had she expected Desmond to be so full of himself.

He betrayed her, and she risked her life to punish him in return?

That was the funniest joke she had heard by far.

""Take it easy. I didn't and I will never do this to you. Now, give me back my phone."" 

With that, she reached for the phone in his hand.

Desmond dodged her hand and went on, ""Fine, I did lie to you today. But you're also to be blamed for it. You bullied Madeline and made her cry. She's just a spoiled girl. She doesn't know any better. Why get mad at her?""

His nonsense stung Beatrice's heart. 

And the way he defended Madeline?

That only rubbed salt into Beatrice's wound.

After a long silence, she finally spoke, sounding heartbroken, ""From now on, I won't bully her. I won't meddle in whatever happens between you two. But you'd better keep her away from me.""

Frowning, Desmond protested, ""She's only a friend of mine. There's nothing between us.""

""Hmm, a friend."" Beatrice held back the urge to expose him, even though she had gathered all the evidence. 

""Alright, my bad. I got the wrong idea. Congratulations on having a new friend then.""

Desmond stared at her, momentarily at a loss for words.

""Just drive,"" Beatrice urged.

Feeling chill all over, she wrapped herself tightly in the suit, a whiff of woody scent drifting into her nose for the second time.

It was then that Desmond noticed the charcoal-gray men's suit she was wearing. The fabric was exquisite. Apparently, it was custom-made. 

""Whose suit is this?"" he inquired.

Staring out the window, Beatrice replied, her words laced with sarcasm, ""It belongs to a new 'friend' of mine.""

Desmond was furious.

With a stern look, he yanked the suit off her and hurled it out the window.

Shocked and angry, Beatrice got out of the car to retrieve it. She still needed to return the suit.

Frustrated by her attempt, Desmond immediately grabbed her and pulled her back. He leaned in and kissed hard on her lips.

In response, Beatrice pressed her lips tightly shut.

Then he pried her mouth open and tangled his tongue with hers in a domineering, unreasonable manner.

By the time he had enough of it, he finally let go of her.

Desmond warned her, his hot breath enveloped her, ""Don't you ever piss me off in this way again. I'm your husband. Care more about my feelings, will you?""

Beatrice was rendered speechless.

In the end, she didn't manage to grab back the suit, which bothered her very much.

\*\*\*

After all that commotion, Beatrice ended up catching a cold and running a fever that evening.

Desmond stayed at home for her sake.

He even cooked her a meal, acting as if he still loved her deep down.

In the middle of the night, her fever still persisted, leaving her drowsy and miserable.

Suddenly, Desmond's phone rang.

Beatrice sat up, and both she and Desmond glanced at the phone. 

It was already 12:35 in the dead of night.

The screen displayed the name \[Bonbon M\].

That intimate contact name spoke volumes.

The sound of the phone vibrating was quite piercing in the quiet night. And Beatrice got more and more annoyed because of it.",1,1747296657.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

He hadn’t dated anyone else since then because it was toxic (she cheated ) and it affected him mentally. 


We have been dating for half a year now and I’ve noticed since the beginning that he is different in financial aspects with me than he was with her. He shared with me previously that he paid for everything when they were together and that even when they were separating he paid for the apartment and gave her all of the belongings which he had bought.


From the beginning of our relationship he asked me if I would be ok with 50/50 or if I expected him to pay for everything. I said I was ok with 50/50, but honestly it caught me off guard. In my last relationship my ex had a provider mentality so he would pay for food/ buy me random things like makeup if I was short on something. I would always pick up the bill for small things like coffee or occasionally a meal as a thank you and to keep things “fair” in my eyes. Well, my current boyfriend is thoughtful as far as giving me flowers for every month and once or twice randomly, but financially he doesn’t have the provider mindset he seemed to have with his ex.
I’ve tried being fair and keeping an open mind because he transitioned jobs from a previously higher paying job he had (and lost because of this ex gf)… but it’s gotten to the point where it is bothering me.


He says he has debt because of that situation to pay off and that’s why he’s tight on money for a bit but I have stuff to pay as well and I have been shouldering much of the financial aspect in dating. For our 4 months we went out of town (his idea) and I paid for a majority of things and the one thing he did pay (dinner), we actually split the bill. I bought him a shirt as a gift and he didn’t get me anything. 


The one thing that set me over the edge was when we went out of town on my birthday. I paid for 90% of things for my BIRTHDAY weekend. We took my car, I paid for gas. I paid for the Airbnb. I paid for 2 out of 3 meals, and he only paid for one because I was in the restroom when they brought the bill. 
I don’t ever give with the expectation of receiving back, but in this case it bothers me because I know how generous he was with his ex and he does NOT do that with me. I don’t know if I’m being irrational or not ",0,1747296648.0,relationships,2,0.5,False
1kn2vjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TitanNews/comments/1kn2vjg/the_benefits_of_coffee_and_more_than_just_a/,The Benefits of Coffee and More Than Just a Morning Boost,"Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world, enjoyed by millions of people every day. While many drink it for its rich flavor and energizing effect, coffee also offers several health benefits when consumed in moderation.

First and foremost, coffee is a great source of caffeine, a natural stimulant that helps improve focus, alertness, and mental performance. This is why many people rely on a cup of coffee to start their day or stay productive at work.

In addition to boosting energy, coffee contains powerful antioxidants. These compounds help protect the body against damage from harmful molecules called free radicals, which are linked to aging and various diseases.

Studies have shown that regular coffee consumption may reduce the risk of several health conditions, including type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and certain types of cancer. Coffee also supports heart health by improving blood vessel function and lowering inflammation.

Moreover, coffee can enhance physical performance. Caffeine increases adrenaline levels, which helps improve endurance and strength during exercise. That’s why athletes often drink coffee before a workout.

However, it’s important to remember that too much coffee can lead to negative effects such as insomnia, anxiety, or increased heart rate. To enjoy the benefits without the downsides, it's best to limit intake to 3–4 cups per day.

Coffee is more than just a tasty beverage it can be a valuable part of a healthy lifestyle when enjoyed responsibly.",1,1747296642.0,TitanNews,0,1.0,False

It started with meeting up through a hook up app and started with having sex. Slowly overtime he started initiating stuff like going to grab something to eat, snap chatting everyday, going to gym, and paying for our coffee. I was under the impression that we were heading towards a relationship and that he would bring it up that conversation.

However almost a year past and I got fed up about there being no conversation on the matter of a relationship so I brought it up and he said he wasn’t ready or looking for one. He then says that we should keep it platonic.

We stopped talking for a month and then he starts talking to me again on Snapchat and we start being strictly just friends for months until he found me on the hook up app again. I didn’t know it was him when we chatted on the app at first, until after he messages me on Snapchat asking if I wanted to come over his place for some fun. I stupidly caved and went over and we hooked up again. Shortly after I texted him on Snapchat asking again about what was going on between us and he said that he still isn’t ready for a relationship and that he’s dealing with stuff financially. I told him that I no longer want to keep talking and have any type of friendship with him unless he wants there to be a relationship between us. 

It’s been about 6 months and he’s messaging me on that hook up app again, knowing that it’s me. I didn’t respond this time but he keeps messaging me on the app. 

I want to text him on Snapchat asking him if anything’s changed for him but I dont know if that’s a good idea. I feel like it would just be a waste of time because if he truly wanted there to be something more he would reach out to me on Snapchat and not on the hook up app. I also don’t want to lose the metaphorical power I have with keeping my distance and staying true to telling him that I don’t want continue talking to him unless he wants us to be in a relationship. 

I’m trying to get over him but part of me still wishes that something can happen between us. It’s my first time ever having feelings for someone. I still keep thinking about him and the thought of him reaching back out to me. What do y’all think I should do? Why is he messaging me on the hook up app?

Then one day that guy send her an inappropriate reel(something sexual which usually couples send each other)

My gf was feeling betrayed and devastated. She told me about this expecting me to sympathize with her. But I choose to blame her for all this saying- why did he send this reel to you only in the entire college? It's all you fault, you are responsible for your actions.

[https://www.plantedshack.com/15-gorgeous-boho-mid-century-modern-living-room/](https://www.plantedshack.com/15-gorgeous-boho-mid-century-modern-living-room/)

  
The fusion of bohemian and mid-century modern styles creates a visually captivating and eclectic living space. Boho chic is known for its vibrant colors, layered textures, and relaxed atmosphere, while mid-century modern designs bring in clean lines, organic shapes, and a sense of timeless elegance. Together, these two styles create living rooms that are both inviting and sophisticated. In this article, we will explore 15 gorgeous Boho mid-century modern living room ideas that will inspire you to create a unique and harmonious space.

  
1. Layered Textures and Patterns

  
One of the hallmark features of Boho design is the use of various textures and patterns. To achieve this look:

  
Mix textiles

  
: Incorporate throw pillows, macramé wall hangings, and shaggy rugs.

  
Use natural elements

  
: Add woven baskets or wooden furniture.

  
Color palette

  
: Opt for earthy tones with pops of vibrant colors.

  
This layering creates an interesting visual dynamic that enhances the mid-century modern elements with bohemian flair.

  
2. Earthy Color Schemes

  
Boho living rooms often embrace earthy tones. For a balanced bohemian mid-century modern space:

  
Color choices

  
: Choose a palette of olive greens, burnt oranges, and deep browns.

  
Accent walls

  
: Consider painting one wall a warm shade or using patterned wallpaper.

  
Complement with neutrals

  
: Pair these colors with whites or greys to keep the room grounded.

  
The earthy colors evoke a sense of warmth and comfort, perfect for a relaxing atmosphere.

  
3. Vintage Furniture Pieces

  
Mid-century modern furniture is characterized by its elegant simplicity. To effectively blend with boho style:

  
Select vintage finds

  
: Shop thrift stores for unique pieces like a Danish lounge chair or a teak coffee table.

  
Revive with textiles

  
: Reupholster older pieces with vibrant fabric or rich textures.

  
Combine styles

  
: Mix in contemporary boho-inspired furniture for contrast.

  
This combination imparts a sense of history to your living room while maintaining modernity.

  
4. Artistic Wall Decor

  
Art plays a crucial role in both Boho and mid-century modern designs. To create a stunning wall display:

  
Gallery wall

  
: Create a gallery wall with a mix of framed artwork, macramé pieces, and mirrors.

  
Layer artworks

  
: Hang pieces at different heights for visual interest.

  
Utilize natural frames

  
: Use wooden or bamboo frames that resonate with mid-century aesthetics.

  
Your walls can become a canvas where bohemian creativity meets mid-century sophistication.

  
5. Cozy Seating Arrangements

  
A key feature of any living room is the seating. To create cozy and inviting areas:

  
Use sectional sofas

  
: A plush sectional can anchor the space.

  
Incorporate poufs

  
: Boho poufs add extra seating and a splash of color.

  
Mix furniture styles

  
: Pair a modern sofa with a vintage armchair for variety.

  
This arrangement will foster conversation and relaxation, making it ideal for gatherings.

  
6. Incorporate Natural Elements

  
Bringing nature indoors is a fundamental part of both styles. Here’s how to do it:

  
Houseplants

  
: Use various greenery like snake plants or ferns to personalize the space.

  
Wood accents

  
: Add wooden shelves, side tables, or driftwood decor pieces.

  
Use stone elements

  
: Decorate with stone vases or tabletops for added texture.

  
These natural touches create a soothing environment that breathes life into your living room.

  
7. Macramé and Textiles

  
Macramé has made a strong comeback in interior design. To integrate it into your living space:

  
Wall hangings

  
: Use macramé wall hangings to add texture and interest.

  
Cushions and throws

  
: Incorporate knitted or woven textiles in your pillows and throws.

  
DIY projects

  
: Try making your own macramé plant hangers for a personalized touch.

  
These elements add a distinctly bohemian vibe while honoring the mid-century modern aesthetic.

  
8. Playful Shapes and Silhouettes

  
Mid-century modern design is known for its innovative shapes. To embrace this:

  
Curvy furniture

  
: Look for sofas and chairs with rounded edges.

  
Accent pieces

  
: Choose coffee tables with asymmetrical designs or interesting bases.

  
Bold rugs

  
: A statement rug featuring geometric patterns can serve as a focal point.

  
By mixing these shapes with boho softness, you cultivate a lively and unique atmosphere.

  
9. Bright and Bold Accessories

  
Accessories bring your space to life. Consider:

  
Colorful artwork

  
: Bright art pieces complement the subtle earth tones.

  
Unique vases

  
: Choose bold vases that can stand alone or hold fresh flowers.

  
Layered lighting

  
: Use pendant lights, table lamps, and fairy lights to create an inviting glow.

  
These accessories add personality and can easily be swapped seasonally to refresh the look.

  
10. Statement Lighting Fixtures

  
Lighting can greatly influence the mood of a room. To achieve this:

  
Retro lamp designs

  
: Look for iconic floor lamps or pendant lights that echo mid-century design.

  
Layered lighting

  
: Combine overhead lights with ambient lamps for a cozy environment.

  
Natural light

  
: Maximize natural light by using sheer curtains or no window coverings at all.

  
A well-lit room feels welcoming and enhances the overall aesthetic.

  
11. Open Floor Plans

  
If your space allows, consider an open floor plan that encourages flow:

  
Zoned areas

  
: Use furniture arrangements to create distinct conversation areas.

  
Rugs for definition

  
: Area rugs can help designate spaces without the need for walls.

  
Transitional pieces

  
: Use versatile furniture that works in multiple areas, like a side table that can be moved around.

  
This open concept makes your living room feel more expansive and connected.

  
12. Use of Curated Collections

  
Curating collections can add a personal touch to your living space:

  
Display collection items

  
: Showcase items like vintage books, travel souvenirs, or unique pottery.

  
Shelving

  
: Use open shelving to display your collections in a way that invites conversation.

  
Mix mediums

  
: Combine ceramics, glass, and wood to create varied visual layers.

  
Such curated collections tell your story and may even spark conversation with guests.

  
13. Incorporating Cultural Prints

  
Incorporate cultural influences through prints and textiles:

  
Global accents

  
: Integrate Moroccan poufs, Indian textiles, or Persian rugs.

  
Artwork selection

  
: Choose art pieces that reflect various cultures and traditions.

  
Textured materials

  
: Use ethnic textiles as throws or cushion covers for added depth.

  
This approach honors international styles while maintaining your Boho mid-century modern theme.

  
14. Functional Yet Delightful Furniture

  
When choosing furniture, opt for functionality that doesn’t compromise style:

  
Multifunctional pieces

  
: Look for ottomans that can provide extra storage.

  
Stylish media units

  
: Choose media units that echo mid-century styles but provide storage for a clean look.

  
Artistic yet usable tables

  
: Consider coffee tables that double as art pieces.

  
Practicality mixed with design ensures your living room remains livable yet aesthetically pleasing.

  
15. Personal Touches and Stories

  
Finally, remember to incorporate items with personal significance:

  
Family heirlooms

  
: Use antique pieces to add historical significance.

  
Travel memories

  
: Display photographs or souvenirs from your travels.

  
Handmade items

  
: Showcase handmade crafts or DIY projects you’ve completed.

  
These personal touches create a living room that feels truly yours and invites guests to connect with your story.

  
Conclusion

  
Creating a Boho mid-century modern living room is all about balancing textures, colors, and personal elements. Choose vintage pieces, mix and match styles, and incorporate plenty of natural elements to achieve this inviting and stylish look.

The only thing that has changed is that I'm using Brita filter, and that the grinder is relatively new (it's a 1zpresso q air) I'm a cheap student and it was available for very little. My pouring might have gotten better? But I don't think that's it. Anyways, the coffee tastes really good now, I enjoy it a lot but can't get it to a reasonable brew time.

Usually it’s not that big of a deal as we go to this same Starbucks everyday and I mean EVERY SINGLE DAY we pull up and they are like you want the brown sugar today [name]. I asked for a receipt for one of the orders and the girl at the window just lost it. And I swear I am not a rude customer, my mom is notoriously known at this Starbucks for being a pain in the ass and I always try to give the baristas a break, small talk etc. but it was like a chain effect today. Homegirl at the window lost it the girl at the coffee station behind her started muggin hella hard and our normal barista was like I apologize. 

I get that the dress code is having everyone in a pickle but I mean is it THAT serious? Call me an asshole if you want but every company has a dress code. People who handle food work in non slip footwear, hair pulled back etc.  And I get it that Starbucks once was a diverse friendly place for not only employees but consumers as well. However Dutch bros does have a similar dress code minus the apron and they seem to be profiting way better than Starbucks these days. A simple google search will tell you that. Idk that was my little rant, but if we are on the bandwagon for boycotting Starbucks I’ll b right there with yall. ",0,1747296044.0,starbucks,0,0.14,False
1kn2q2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1kn2q2s/6_mistakes_that_messed_up_stalled_my_progress/,6 mistakes that messed up / stalled my progress incl WL,"TL;DR : it was nicotine, caffeine( enormous amounts ), alkohol, not eating enough in general and not eating enough salt, finally dairy especially heavy cream for coffee, and cheese.

First of all I just joined so greetings to all, pleased to found this community!

So I was carnivor-ish for about last 2 years. It took me two long years to finally ( or so I think ) fine tune the whole thing, and realise mistakes I was making completely unaware of. Hope some of you, especially new kids on the block will find it useful and avoid frustration along their way ;) DISCLAIMER: I still managed to loose about 25kg/50lbs during this time, despite all those errors, however after hearing a plethora of podcasts, stories and what nots, I know I could acheve this within several months thus ""buing myself happy time"" much faster!

1.Nicotine: Guys do not smoke on carnivore! ( do not smoke at all) I was heavy smoker for 20+ years, we all know how cigarette smoke affects your mood and energy levels, but especially on carnivore A) you will not see much of a difference in mood change and genral well-being B)inhaling smoke and simultaneously eating tons of fat is a VERY BAD IDEA.( dyor why) C) Nicotine fiddles with and suppresses your appetite - you may find yourself undereating what causes WL stalls.

2. Caffeine: I would drink anything between 10-15+ cups of creamy coffee a day (not even exaggerating) especially during long and stressful day at work, it would go great with a cigarette ;), and sort of realizing that it can also tame your appetite I had completely no idea it causes cortisol to shoot up the sky, so in my situation I was on high cortisol basically all the time. Cortisol = inability to burn fat.

3. Alcohol: I would occasionally (2-3) times a month get drunk and cheat with pizzas and all the other junk, wake up feeling like crap and full of regrets. According to dr Anthony Chaffee even small amount of booze affects your body for another 3 weeks. So basically each time you dring, you start all over again.🤦‍♂️

4.Not eating enough: So I would eat around 500g of meat + several eggs a day, my hunger was suppressed by nicotine and caffeine, and I thought I'm not hungry so it's enough. Well it wasn't. My weight didnt move down a single gramm and I was frustrated out of my mind why, especially that I have physically demanded work. I thought I should be shredding, in the meantime my body thought it's starving and held on to all that extra fat because that'w what bodies do ;)

5: Not eating enough salt: This is the big one. I didn't know how important it is to pay attention to sodium intake levels on carnivore. I thought if I ""put some extra salt"" on my meat it will be enough. It wasnt. I couldn't get why on some days I fell reasonably good and on others as cr*p, and the reason was random out of the blue sodium intake. How did I find out and am 100% sure about it? Well on one of those low mood low energy muscle cramping day I was driving and listening to one of Dr Ken Berry podcasts. He was saying that each time he feels a bit off he would lick on his himalayan salt stone and in the matter of minutes he would be good to go. I thought hmm, interesting, i pulled up and bought sea salt bag and showed down like a teaspoon size with water. Man, 10 minutes later and I begun to feel like million dollars, i was absolutely shocked. Today I carry abagg of salt everywhere I go like a little salt junkie ;)

6. Dairy: this stuff is totally addictive. I couldnt imagine drinking coffee without a heavy cream, or bite on a block of cheese like several times a week. I thought hey! Its animal product, so its carnivore!. Technically it is, but in short and simplified: dairy has one job: to hook up infant animal on itself and make it fat as soon as possible. No dairy for me anymore for now, HOWEVER:

Once I hit my weight / mood goals I will want to reintroduce a little bit of heavy cream to my coffee ( which I drink.now 1 or 2 instead of 15;)) and also cheese, since weightloss is not needed anymore, and then will monitor closely how it affects me.

So to sum it up, it took me 2 years to figure it all out, 1st May I begun my journey again with all the above fixed, already 4kg / 8lb down, and I feel amazing.

Good luck y'all!",4,1747296016.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False

I am 28 female and throughout my life, ever since I was a teenager, I have constantly felt like I am the person who puts the most effort into relationships, whether they be friendly, romantic, or even familial. 

Even if things start out well, slowly but surely, the other person ends up calling/texting less, canceling on our meetings, and always being busy/prioritizing other things. Then if I stop putting as much effort myself, the relationship immediately dies without the other person seemingly caring. 

That has happened in all sorts of relationships. 

It may seem childish but I often just end up thinking no one likes me, and that is hard to swallow. 

My personality: I'm not the most interesting person out there, but I do see myself as a smart, friendly, open person who's a good listener. I don't bully or criticize my friends, and I haven't really had any big fights with them. I don't like going to loud clubs and prefer a more quiet dinner or coffee date, or just going to the movies. 

One thing I tend to do is become overly enthusiastic about a new relationship, so I'm afraid I may be showing clingy or desperate vibes.

I didn’t even get the chance to tell him I’m carrying his baby.“It’s just us now,” I whispered. “And we’re going to be okay.”I will make him regret this.

Chapter 1Serena’s POV“Congratulations, Mrs. Ryan,” the doctor said with a bright smile. “You’re pregnant!”I froze, her words taking a moment to sink in. “I’m… pregnant?” I stammered, staring at her.“Yes,” she confirmed, nodding enthusiastically. “About a month along. Your test results are very clear.”My hands instinctively rested on my flat stomach. “A baby,” I whispered, a small smile creeping onto my lips. A rush of excitement and nerves filled me.This was the best news I had ever received. Finally, something to bring Ryan and me closer. Maybe this would change things between us. Maybe he’d finally see me as more than just his contract wife.“Thank you, doctor,” I said, standing up and shaking her hand.As I left the clinic, I couldn’t stop grinning. I was going to be a mother. And Ryan was going to be a father. He deserved to know right away.I headed straight to his office, clutching my purse tightly. I imagined how he would react. Would he be shocked? Happy? Maybe even… excited?When I arrived at the company, I walked through the familiar halls, my heels clicking against the polished floor. I smiled at the receptionist, who gave me a polite nod.His office door was slightly ajar when I approached. I was about to knock when a sound from inside made me stop.A low chuckle. A woman’s voice.“Ryan, stop it,” the voice teased, playful and sultry.I frowned and peeked through the gap. My heart stopped at what I saw. “She’s back?”Ryan stood between Kate’s legs, his hands on her waist. She was perched on his desk, leaning back slightly, her arms wrapped around his neck. Their lips were locked in a passionate kiss, his hand sliding up her thigh.I felt like I had been punched in the stomach. My hand flew to my mouth to muffle a gasp as tears blurred my vision.“No,” I whispered under my breath, stepping back. This couldn’t be real. It couldn’t be happening.Kate’s voice broke through my disbelief. “You missed me, didn’t you?”“You know I did,” Ryan replied, his tone soft and intimate. “You’re the only one I’ve ever wanted.”The words sliced through me like a knife. I couldn’t bear to watch any longer. I turned to leave, my legs shaking beneath me.But my heels betrayed me. The sharp sound of one striking the floor made Ryan’s head snap toward the door.“Who’s there?” he called out, his voice sharp.I didn’t wait to be seen. I bolted down the hallway, tears streaming down my cheeks.“Serena?” I heard him call, but I didn’t stop. I ran out of the building, ignoring the curious stares from the staff, and hailed the first cab I saw.When I got home, I slammed the door behind me, the sound echoing in the empty flat.“Damn it!” I screamed, throwing my purse across the room. My body shook as I collapsed onto the couch, burying my face in my hands.The image of Ryan and Kate together was burned into my mind. The way he touched her, kissed her… like she was the only person in the world.He had never treated me that way.The only day we made out was because he returned home drunk!“How could he do this to me?” I choked out, my voice breaking. “Why now? Why, when I—”I placed a trembling hand over my stomach. “How am I supposed to tell him now?”The door opened behind me. I froze, wiping my tears quickly as Ryan stepped in.“Serena,” he said, his voice cold and distant.I didn’t turn to face him. “What do you want, Ryan?”“We need to talk.” His footsteps grew closer, and I could feel his presence looming behind me.“About what?” I asked, my voice flat.He moved to stand in front of me, adjusting his tie. His expression was unreadable, but his tone was sharp. “I want a divorce.”The words hit me like a blow. I stared at him, my chest tightening. “A… divorce?”“Yes.”“Why?” My voice cracked, but I refused to let him see how much this hurt. “What did I do wrong, Ryan?”“This isn’t about you,” he said, avoiding my gaze. “This marriage isn’t working. It’s better if we both move on.”“Move on?” I laughed bitterly, shaking my head. “You mean you want to move on. With Kate, right?”His jaw tightened, but he didn’t deny it.“Say it,” I demanded, standing up. “Say her name!”“Kate,” he said after a pause. “I love her, Serena. I’ve always loved her.”My knees felt weak, but I forced myself to stay upright. “So that’s it? You’re throwing me away for her? After everything—”He cut me off. “This was a contract, Serena. You knew that from the start.”“I didn’t know it would feel like this!” I shouted, my voice cracking. “I didn’t know you’d break me like this, Ryan!”He sighed, pulling a stack of papers from his briefcase. “I had these prepared,” he said, placing them on the table. “You can read them at your own pace. I’m willing to offer financial support if you need it.”I stared at the divorce papers, my hands shaking. “Support?” I laughed hollowly. “You think money will fix this? Fix me?”“I’m trying to be fair,” he said defensively.“Fair?” I repeated, my voice rising. “You cheated on me, Ryan. And now, you’re talking about fairness?”He didn’t respond, only adjusted his tie again. “I’ll give you some space,” he muttered, turning toward the door.“Ryan,” I called after him, my voice shaking.He paused but didn’t turn around. “What?”I swallowed hard, my heart pounding. “I hope she’s worth it.”For a moment, he didn’t say anything. Then he nodded and walked out, the door clicking shut behind him.I sank back onto the couch, tears spilling down my face. The man I had loved with all my heart had chosen someone else.I looked at the divorce papers on the table, their presence mocking me. Slowly, I picked up the pen and signed my name.With that, it was over.I placed a hand on my stomach, a bittersweet smile forming on my lips. “It’s just us now,” I whispered. “And we’re going to be okay.”Chapter 25 YEARS LATERSerena’s POVI walked into my bright, sunny workplace at Rocky’s Designs. The walls were painted a light yellow, and the shelves were filled with sketches and small flower pots.My large desk was at the centre, with a window behind it showing the city skyline.This was my firm.I developed it from the ground up, using only a few ideas and a lot of hard labour.""Good morning, Miss Serena!"" Emma, my assistant, said with a wide smile as she entered behind me.She held a cup of coffee for me.“Good morning, Emma,” I said, taking the cup. “Thank you. Do we have a busy day today?""""Oh, yes,"" she replied, gazing at her tab.“You have a meeting at 10 with the marketing team, a call with a client at 11, and a lunch meeting with Mr. Hayes.""“Mr. Hayes?"" I enquired, lifting an eyebrow.Emma nodded. ""He wants to discuss the new project."" I sighed, yet smiled.“Alright, let's get to it.""As I sat down, I looked at the photograph on my desk. It was a picture of my four-year-old daughter, Amy.Her sparkling blue eyes and curling brown hair would always make me grin. She was my entire universe.“Mommy's working hard for you,"" I said to the photo before turning on the computer.The meeting began at ten o'clock. I sat at the head of the table, with the marketing team assembled around.“Okay, let's hear your ideas for the new campaign,"" I said, tapping my pen on my notebook.Jason, a young team member, spoke up. ""We were thinking about using bright colours and fun patterns to complement the new designs. It's clean and modern, just like Rocky's designs!""I nodded, enjoying his exuberance.“That sounds fantastic, Jason. Let's make sure the message is clear and easy to understand. Our designs aim to make homes happy and beautiful.""“Yes, ma'am!"" Jason replied, scribbling notes.The meeting lasted an hour, and at the end, I felt proud of my team.They were as inventive and passionate as I thought they would be.I met Mr. Hayes for lunch at the cafeteria in my company. He was a tall man with grey hair and a pleasant smile.“Ms. Serena, it's always a pleasure,"" he added as we exchanged handshakes.“Good to see you, too, Mr. Hayes,"" I said.We sat at a table near the window. The server handed us menus, and we ordered sandwiches and ice tea.It wasn't long before the meeting was wrapped up. We shook hands, and I walked towards the lift to return to my office.My heels clicked against the tiled floor. I was deep in contemplation, going over the concepts from the day, when I got a weird sensation.It was as if someone was observing me. I looked over my shoulder and saw nothing peculiar.I dismissed the feeling and entered the lift, pressing the button for my floor.The doors started to close, and as they did, I heard a voice say, ""Wait!"" The voice caused my breath to catch.It sounded too familiar… the voice. But before I could respond, the lift doors closed and I was on my way up.I shook my head, convincing myself it was nothing.Ryan's POV.I arrived at Rocky's Designs, with my assistant, Jefferson, close behind.The structure looked sleek and modern, with a lot of bustle.I had come here to discuss a possible collaboration, and while I was unfamiliar with the organisation, I had heard about their remarkable work.As we approached the foyer, my gaze searched the surroundings. It was bright and friendly, with stylish furniture and artwork that reflected the company's creative side.“This way, Mr Winters,"" Jefferson remarked, motioning towards the lifts.As we waited, my attention was drawn to a woman walking in front of us. She wore a fitted navy dress and heels that clicked softly against the ground.Her hair flowed down her back in waves, and something about her strides, the way she carried herself, tugged at my memory.I narrowed my eyes, trying to place her.“No,” I muttered beneath my breath. It couldn’t be.The lift doors opened, I was stunned for a second, unsure whether my eyes were playing tricks on me.But she turned slightly, allowing me to catch a glimpse of her profile. My heart has stopped.“Serena?"" I spoke softly at first.""Wait!"" I called again, louder this time, and moved quickly towards the lift.She did not hear me—or perhaps she disregarded me.By the time I arrived, the doors had already closed.“Sir?"" Jefferson enquired, looking at me with worry. I stood there, staring at the closing lift doors, my thoughts racing.Was it actually her? After so many years?“Is something wrong, Mr. Winters?"" Jefferson asked again. I shook my head, but my chest felt tighter.“No. Let us take the next lift.” My thoughts were anything but peaceful.What was Serena doing here? And why did meeting her again rekindle sentiments I thought I had buried years ago?Jefferson was still trying to figure out what was going on with me when he pressed the lift button.He walked in right away, and I was going to follow suit when I heard a small voice from a distance.“Wait for me, please!"" yelled a tiny girl with haste.I turned and saw a little girl with wavy brown hair bouncing as she rushed towards the lift.She was holding a teddy bunny in one hand and waving her other arm in the air to get our attention.Her brilliant blue eyes gleamed, and I couldn't help but smile at her innocence.""Hold the door for me!"" she exclaimed again, her small legs straining to close the gap.I reflexively held the lift door open and glanced at Jefferson, who gave me a puzzled expression.“It's just a kid,"" I said with a shrug, motioning for the small girl to enter.""Thank you so much, sir!"" she exclaimed, gathering her breath as she entered the lift.Her speech was pleasant, friendly, and very mature for someone so young. She held her bunny teddy and smiled up at me.“You're welcome,"" I said, still amused. ""What are you doing here alone? Shouldn't someone be with you?""“Oh, I'm not alone,"" she replied confidently. ""I'm here to see my mummy, she works here.""Her mum? My curiosity piqued. ""Does your mum work at Rocky's Designs? What does she do?""""She's the boss,"" the little girl said proudly, standing a little taller. ""She's the CEO!""I raised an eyebrow. ""The CEO?""The child nodded enthusiastically, her curls bouncing.“Yup! Mommy is really busy, yet she always finds time for me.""The lift dinged, indicating that we had reached the top floor. As the doors swung open, the little girl dashed out with the zest that only a child possessed.“Thanks again, mister!"" she murmured as she ran towards the reception counter.I took a slower stride out, following her out of curiosity. She dashed up to the woman sitting behind the desk, who smiled pleasantly at her.""Hi, Amy!"" said the receptionist, who identified herself as Emma on her nameplate.“Here to see your mum?""“Yes, please!"" Amy chirped.Emma chuckled. ""Alright, let me take you to her office."" She stood up and extended her hand for Amy to accept.Amy looked back at me. ""You can come too, mister!"" Before I could react, Emma turned to me with a pleasant but strong smile.“I apologise, sir. Strangers are not allowed in the CEO's office.” I nodded, understanding, but as Emma and Amy walked away, something caught my attention just as the office door opened and closed.A nameplate on the large desk inside the room gleamed in the light.Serena Winthrop, CEOMy breath hitched.It is her!Chapter 3Ryan's POVI left Rocky's Designs that day with my head racing.It had to be her.The name on the desk; Serena Winthrop. It was not a coincidence.Could the little girl be Serena's daughter? I could not quit thinking about her.We shared a past. How things ended drastically. And now, five years later, she is running a profitable business and maybe raising a child.I shook my head as I considered the child who could be—No, I needed answers and would get them.The following day, I arrived at the company early, determined to see her.I had a meeting with her staff to discuss a potential collaboration, but I wasn't going to finalise anything until I saw Serena.I wanted to know if she was the CEO and, more crucially, if the little girl was her daughter.The meeting started in a huge conference room. Her employees seemed eager to impress me, pitching ideas and tactics for how our companies could collaborate.But my attention was elsewhere.“Mr. Winters,"" one of them said, nervously smiling. ""As you can see, we've put together a detailed proposal for the collaboration. Do you have any questions so far?""I sat back in my chair and crossed my arms. “Yes, I do.""My tone was gentle yet firm. ""I need the CEO present at this meeting. If she's not here, I'm afraid I won't be able to proceed with this partnership.""The room went silent. The workers exchanged nervous glances, apparently taken aback by my demand.“Sir,"" one of them gently stated, ""Ms. Winthrop is a very busy woman. She doesn't generally attend these meetings.”""Well, she'll need to make an exception,"" I said. ""I never sign deals without first meeting with the person in charge. If the CEO is not present, I will take my business elsewhere.""Panic washed over their faces. They understood how crucial this relationship was to their organisation.After a brief, hushed talk between them, one of them stood up. ""Excuse us for a moment, Mr. Winters,"" he said, exiting the room with another coworker.Serena's POVI was in my office studying some reports when I heard a knock on the door.“Come in,"" I said without looking up.Emma entered, looking apprehensive. ""Ms. Serena, we have a situation.""I looked at her with a frown. ""What kind of situation?""“It’s the client from yesterday, Mr. Winters. He refuses to proceed with the collaboration unless you attend the meeting.""My heart skips a beat.Mr Winters? Isn't that Ryan? I knew I’d heard a voice identical to his yesterday, and he was most likely seeking to confirm his concerns.“Can't someone else handle it?"" I asked, attempting to calm my anxiety.Emma shakes her head. ""He insisted on meeting you. If you don't go, we may lose the transaction.""I sighed, seeing I had little alternative. ""Alright. Let us get this over with.”I straightened my blazer and followed Emma to the conference room.As the door opened, all eyes shifted to me.And there he was. Ryan.He stood up as I entered, his gaze fixed on mine. For a little period, I was unable to breathe.He looked the same but different. Ryan had grown older and more mature, but he remains undeniably Ryan.“Ms. Winthrop,"" one of my employees announced, shattering the stillness.""This is Mr. Winters.""“I know who he is,"" I responded sternly, cutting him off.Ryan's lips curved into a small smirk. ""Hello, Serena.""I forced a pleasant smile. ""Mr. Winters.""The anxiety in the room was evident, but I got through it. I couldn't let my feelings show, especially in front of my workers.""Shall we proceed?"" I enquired, taking a seat at the head of the table.Ryan's gaze remained fixed on me throughout the meeting.I maintained a professional demeanour, focussing on the specifics of the partnership while avoiding any personal engagement with him.Ryan's POVSerena strolled into the room, and I recognised her right away.She hadn't changed much over the course of five years. She still exuded the same confidence and presence that lured me to become her friend in school.However, there was something else now. A wall. She kept her responses brief and professional, not meeting my gaze for more than a few seconds.I listened to the remainder of the talk, paying little attention to the contents.I couldn't stop thinking about her and the little kid I saw yesterday.When the meeting concluded, I stood up and met Serena's eyes.“Ms. Winthrop,"" I said with a formal tone. ""I'd like to have a word with you in private.""She paused, staring at her team. They gazed at her with anticipation, evidently expecting she would accept.“Of course,"" she replied regretfully. ""This way."" She escorted me to her office, keeping the door open so I could enter.The room looked as bright and immaculate as I remembered from yesterday.“Please, have a seat,"" she added, her voice clipped.I sat down and watched her closely as she took her seat behind the desk.""What do you want, Ryan?"" she enquired, folding her hands on the desk.I leaned forwards. ""You, Serena. I want answers.""“Answers about what?"" she enquired, pretending ignorance.“Don't play games with me, Serena,"" I added with a harder tone. ""The little girl I saw yesterday—Is she your daughter?""Her countenance froze, and for a brief minute, I believed she was about to tell me. But as she opened her mouth to speak, her phone rang, interrupting her response.She looked at the caller ID, as she responded. ""Hello?""I couldn't hear the voice on the other end, but her pale face and panicked eyes were clear.“What happened?"" she enquired, her voice quivering. ""Is she okay?""There was a moment before she rose up abruptly, grabbing her bag.“I'll be there right away,"" she replied before hanging up.“What's going on?"" I enquired while standing as well.Serena barely noticed me as she ran towards the door. ""My daughter."" She was injured at school and rushed to the hospital.""""Hold on, I'd drive you there."" I replied, praying she wouldn't answer no.I could tell she was apprehensive, but she eventually nodded.Chapter 4Ryan's POVThe drive to the hospital was tense. Serena sat stiffly in the passenger seat, clutching her phone like a lifeline.She kept looking at it, her lips pulled together. I wanted to reassure her, but I wasn't sure how.“What hospital?"" I enquired, breaking the stillness.“Private Children's Hospital,"" she answered, her voice clipped.I nodded and sped up. We got to the hospital in record time.Serena got out of the car before I could turn off the engine, her heels clicking rapidly against the sidewalk as she rushed inside.I followed closely, unable to stop the sinking feeling in my chest.At the front desk, she enquired about her daughter with a mix of worry and authority.“Amy Winthrop. ""Where is she?""“Room 208,"" the receptionist replied.Serena did not wait for any additional information. She turned and ran down the corridor, her urgency drawing me along.When we arrived at the front of the room, she came to a sudden halt and turned to me.Her eyes were full of contradictory feelings. ""You don't have to come in,"" she said.I paused, not wanting to interrupt such a private time.“I'll wait here,"" I suggested. She offered a brief nod and disappeared into the room, the door closing behind her.I leaned against the wall and crossed my arms. My thoughts raced.I was almost positive that Amy was Serena's daughter. But was she mine, too?Serena's POVMy heart broke when I walked into the room and saw Amy lying on the hospital bed.Her petite frame appeared delicate, her wavy hair tangled, and her blue eyes sad.“Mommy!"" she wailed, extending her arms. I ran to her side and carefully scooped her up.“Oh, my baby. I'm here. Mommy is here."" Her arms clung to my neck, and I could feel her tiny body trembling against mine.“She's fine,"" the nurse reassured me while changing Amy's IV. ""A little shaken, but nothing serious. ""The doctor will be in shortly to confirm.""""Thank you,"" I said softly, touching Amy's hair.Amy sniffled and drew back slightly, her bright blue eyes staring up at me. ""Mommy, isn't that the man from the lift outside the door?""I froze, my heart missing a beat. ""What man?""“The one from yesterday. He held the lift for me,"" she added, her interest piqued.“I think I saw him through the door's little glass window earlier.""I forced a serene grin. ""It's probably just someone who resembles him, honey. Don't worry about it right now.""Amy bent her head and studied me. ""Mommy, he was polite. Very nice.""“I'm sure he was, baby,"" I replied, kissing her forehead. ""But let's not think about that now, okay?""She nodded, her energy diminishing as the nurse returned to take her vital signs.As I sat with Amy, my thoughts kept turning to Ryan. I knew he was outside waiting.It was exactly like him—stubborn and relentless.Ryan's POVI paced outside the hospital room in serious concentration.If Amy turns out to be my daughter, everything will change.I couldn't stop thinking about how Serena had stared at me earlier, her defences raised like a castle.I was sure she was hiding something.Finally, the door opened, and Serena emerged. Her face was pallid, and her shoulders drooped from fatigue.“How is she?"" I enquired.""She's okay,"" she murmured softly. ""Only a few bruises. The doctor says she'll be able to go home soon."" Relief flooded over me.“That's good.""We remained there in awkward silence for a while before I revealed what had been bothering me.“Serena, is Amy my daughter?"" Her eyes widened, and she looked back at the door, as if she was afraid someone would hear.“Ryan, this isn't the time—""“It is,"" I interrupted her.“I need to know. Five years ago, I made the biggest mistake in my life. I allowed someone else to come between us, and I served you with divorce papers because I was too blind to recognise what I already had. I thought I was pursuing love, but I had no idea I was leaving it behind.""Serena's expression darkened. ""You're oversimplifying things, Ryan. You didn't just leave me… you broke me.""Her remarks hit me like a blow to the chest, but I refused to back down.“Yes, I did. I will never forgive myself for that. But if Amy is mine, I want to be present in her life. I have to be.""Serena looked down, her hands trembling.For a second, I believed she was going to tell me the truth. But before she could speak, the nurse appeared at the doorway.“She's asking for you,"" the nurse informed Serena.Serena nodded and returned her attention to me.“We'll talk another time, Ryan,"" she remarked before entering the room.I exhaled softly, frustration and hope battling within me.\~\~\~I lingered outside the hospital because I couldn't force myself to leave.Amy was still asleep in Serena's arms when she eventually stepped out.Her small head lay on Serena's shoulder, and her hair framed her calm expression.Serena seems shocked to find me still there.“You didn't have to wait,"" she explained quietly.“I was going to drop you off at home,"" I said. My eyes were locked on Amy, and my heart felt like it was about to burst.""You don't need to worry about it. Someone brought my automobile here.” Serena said as she walked towards her car.I followed, offering to help. ""Let me carry her.""She looked unsure, but eventually nodded and delicately moved Amy into my arms.Holding her seemed weird. She was so little and lovely. My heart ached from emotions I didn't understand.We arrived at Serena's car, and I gently placed Amy in her car seat.I stepped back and turned to face Serena. ""We need to continue our previous discussion,"" I reiterated.She glanced at me with cautious eyes. ""Oh, please. ""Not now, Ryan.""I wasn't ready to back down, but seeing how fatigued she appeared, I hesitantly spoke. ""Soon, Serena. You owe me an explanation.""She did not answer, but I noticed the conflicted glances in her eyes as she got into her car and drove away.I hurried to my car, got in, and began following her.Chapter 5Ryan sat in his car a few houses down from where Serena had parked, his hands firmly grasping the steering wheel.The small home, with its well manicured plants and comforting lights lighting inside, told him one thing; Serena had made her life here without him.He wasn't sure what to expect, but seeing the house triggered a peculiar combination of emotions; shame and longing.He watched Serena gently carry a sleeping Amy into the house. The sight of his daughter caused his chest to hurt.He had missed so much, years of her life that he couldn't reclaim.But right now, he wasn't there for Amy. He needed to see Serena.Ryan waited until the lights in the house darkened, then calculated how long it would take Serena to tuck Amy into bed.His mind raced, and memories of their time together came flooding back.When they were only pals, her laughter would lighten even his worst days. After they married, she gazed at him as if he were her entire universe.But then, he had thrown everything away.Not tonight.Tonight, he refused to let her push him away.When enough time had elapsed, he stepped out of his car, his resolve unwavering. He came up to her door and rang the bell.Serena was startled by the sound of the doorbell, and her heart raced.Who could be here at this hour? She hesitated for a bit before walking to the door.She noticed him while looking through the peephole.Ryan.Her pulse sped, and a rush of emotions washed over her—anger, perplexity, and something else she didn't want to accept.She opened the door slightly while holding the chain lock in place.“What are you doing here? Are you stalking me?” she asked sternly.Ryan's gaze was fierce, his eyes fixed on her.“I could not leave things as they were, Serena. We need to talk.""“There's nothing to talk about,"" she said, beginning to close the door.Ryan pressed his hand against the door, using his strength to keep it open.“Let me in, Serena,"" he murmured quietly, but with a demanding tone.She hesitated, sighed, and briefly closed the door to undo the chain.Ryan did not wait when she reopened it. He walked inside and slammed the door behind him.“Ryan, I—"" Serena began, but before she could finish, he was on her.His hands cupped her face, and his lips smashed down on hers with such force that she lost her breath.She froze for a brief minute, taken aback by the ferocity of his kiss. But then her body failed her.She melted into him, her hands grabbing his shirt as his lips pressed against hers, demanding and relentless.It had been so long since she felt this, and her carefully constructed defences fell in an instant.“Ryan,"" she muttered against his lips, but it came across more as a plea than a protest.He did not stop. His hands slipped down to her waist, bringing her closer until there was no room between them.“I've missed you,"" he said softly, his voice raspy and full of love.Serena's determination weakened. She'd spent years convincing herself she was over him and had moved on.But now, with his touch sparking every nerve in her body, all of the falsehoods she had told herself began to unravel.""Stop,"" she said quietly, but her body betrayed her as she kissed him back just as hard.Ryan picked her effortlessly and carried her to the couch. He lowered her carefully, his lips never leaving hers.""Ryan, we shouldn't…"" she started, but his kisses ran down her neck, leaving a trail of heat.“Tell me to stop, Serena,"" he said, his voice heavy and desperate.However, she didn't.The night passed in a flurry of intensity and intense emotion.Serena had forgotten what it was like to be touched by him and feel so loved.She despised herself for giving in so quickly, but nothing else mattered in that moment.When she eventually fell asleep, her head resting on Ryan's chest, she felt a peculiar sensation of calm that she hadn't felt in years.\~\~\~\~Ryan left Serena's house early the next morning, the fresh air doing little to quench the fire that remained in his veins.As he approached his car and took his phone from his pocket, the screen lighted up with several missed calls from Kate, his girlfriend.His jaw tightened as he looked at the notifications, wondering why she called without returning the call and drove away.\*\*\*\*Serena awoke to an empty bed.For a while, she believed it was all a dream. But when she saw the tousled blankets partly on the floor beside her, truth struck her like a tidal wave.She sat up, holding the blanket to her chest, her cheeks flushed with humiliation.“What have I done?"" she said to herself. The recollections from the night before came flooding back.She let Ryan back in, allowing him to touch and embrace her. She had allowed him to see a side of her that she had kept concealed for so long.Serena hid her face in her palms. She felt weak and silly.Ryan had left her once before, and she vowed never to let him hurt her again. But now she was unsure.A quiet knock on her bedroom door interrupted her thoughts.“Mommy?"" Amy's tiny voice rang out.Serena instantly controlled herself and put on a robe before opening the door.“Good morning, darling. How are you feeling now?"" she said, attempting a grin.“Good morning, I'm feeling better mommy."" Amy replied with a drowsy grin.""Can we have pancakes?""Serena nodded and rubbed Amy's hair softly, happy for the distraction. ""Of sure, Baby. Go wash up, and I'll begin making them.""""You're the best Mommy ever…"" Amy exclaimed.Serena leaned on the doorframe while Amy rushed away.Her mind was still racing, but she put those ideas aside. She needed to focus on Amy.But deep inside, she knew it wasn't over. Ryan returned, and things were far from resolved.",1,1747295621.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1kn2lzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1kn2lzr/the_zoetrope/,The Zoetrope,"My brother and I found a mysterious room in an old vicarage we’re renovating. Since the vicar’s death decades prior the house has remained abandoned. It was after we peeled the wallpaper that we found the hidden door. A golden key unlocked it and stale air flooded over us. The hidden room was large. The walls were bare and the floors were polished wood. The windows had been bricked up. A beautiful hand-crafted zoetrope, with a dull brass barrel, stood in the middle of the floor. Bernard and I gasped. It had intricate designs in faded paint around it’s wooden base. Bernard’s face fell. “Oh, looks like the animation is gone. What a shame.” I frowned. He pointed to the long, white rectangular card fitted within the barrel. It was completely blank. 

Later that day he called, “Alice!” I quickly stumbled into the secret room. The zoetrope was on its side while Bernard crouched at its wooden base. The air was thick with the caustic smell of polish. “Take a look,” he said. I crouched down next to him and peered. There was some kind of phrase carved into the underside of the base. Short, ugly cuts obscured the carved letters beneath. Bernard read aloud, “Something – *when* – something – *Abyss*?” The last word wasn’t quite clear. Was the ‘y’ really a ‘u’? I chuckled. Bernard grunted, “What’s so funny?” 

“It’s just, to me this last word could also easily spell ‘anus’.” I laughed. Bernard’s eyes shot death rays at me, “Come on. Please. Why would someone write this? Then scratch it out? What could it have been?” I shrugged, “no idea.” 

A few hours later, while I was preparing lunch, Bernard burst into the small kitchen. I jumped with fright. “Bernard, I swear!” I stopped and stared. Bernard’s face was white. He was shaking violently. My heart thumped hard. “What’s going on? Are you hurt?” I asked, my voice trembled. He rubbed his stubble. He slowly sank into a chair, “It’s crazy. Crazy! I – I can’t explain it. No. I’m not hurt. Just. Shocked more than anything.” I poured him a glass of water. After a minute he was less shaky, “I’m not sure what happened. I fixed the zoetrope and, well, I was curious. I thought I’d give it a test to see if I’d fixed the mechanism properly. So, I wound it up and flipped the switch to turn it on. Then – “ His voice trailed off. His eyes grew empty. “Bernard?” I asked. He blinked and shook his head. “Sorry, it’s just. It’s just *weird*. You really have to experience it for yourself. Impossible to explain otherwise.” 

A few moments later we were back in the hidden room. I was shaking with anticipation as I kneeled before the zoetrope. Bernard wound the mechanism, and with a nod toward me, flicked the brass switch. I stared directly into the vertical gaps within the brass drum of the zoetrope. The mechanism hummed, buzzed and whirred. The barrel spun. Faster. 

And faster. 

Faster still. 

I stared but saw nothing but the white emptiness of the animation strip. A strange buzzing sensation bloomed in my extremities. My eyes locked in place. Soon the buzzing consumed my entire body. The whirring of the zoetrope filled my mind. The humming turned into whispers. Soft. Then suddenly, a distinct voice took shape. It was familiar, but not mine. I faded as the voice forced memories into my mind:

*After my wealthy great-aunt passed away I was tasked with looking after her massive house. At first, I was more than happy to oblige, but soon I got nervous. Stuff kept going missing. Cutlery, crockery, batteries, newspapers and candles were never where I remembered leaving them. One day I even heard footsteps in the night so I called the police. Of course, they found no one. They mentioned there had been break-ins in the area lately.*

*The next night I woke up to the sound of breathing in the deep dark of my room. My heart leapt into my mouth. My eyes snapped open. In a sliver of pale moonlight, I saw a tall, figure dressed in a black balaclava looming at my bedside. I yelled and jumped out of bed. Suddenly I heard a slam. Then a feral shriek came from where the picture hung above my bed. I heard a click and the sound of something whizzing through the air. Suddenly there was a grunt and I heard something heavy crumple to the ground. I turned to look back at my bed. My eyes opened so wide I thought they might pop out. Just above where I had been sleeping, the painting was not there! Instead there was a large, rectangular piece of even deeper darkness. I quickly swiped at the curtains to let in more light. I screamed. The moonlight had momentarily revealed a long skeletal arm. A grey arm attached to a hand with dirty long nails. In its tight grip was a small crossbow. Before I could see more I heard another shriek and the picture slammed.* 

*The cops made me stay in my room as they went through the secret painting-doorway. Soon they called me to join them. I stepped on my bed and walked through the doorway into a small stone tunnel. I immediately noticed the smell. It stank like piss and shit. It was also narrow, damp and rough. I coughed and held my nose as I followed their flashlights. They showed me a small room connected to the tunnel filled with old newspapers, cups, pencils – all junk really. A chill spread down my neck. “Holy shit, it’s where the bugger lives! He still here?” I asked. The cops shrugged. After they called for backup, they combed the tunnels but found no one. I have left the house now and will never go back. The thought that this whole time I’d been living beside some stranger. Some ghost. Even if he did rescue me, it makes me shiver. Every night I lie awake thinking about it. I look over at my walls. They are dark and bare. A shiver rolls down my back. Could there be a pair of beady eyes watching me right now?*

Suddenly, the voice stopped. I felt my limbs again. There was a loud *clunk* as the barrel of the zoetrope stopped spinning. A deafening, disorienting silence pressed tight against my ears. I was left dumbfounded. Slowly, I clambered to my feet. I wiped beads of sweat from my forehead. “Did you see that too?” I asked shakily. He nodded, “Oh yea, the thing about the guy living in that big house? That the burglar was killed by that crazy squatter? Yea, I saw it too. It has to be some illusion. Trick. Hypnotism?” Static filled my brain, “Why would anyone make something like *that*?” I asked and took a few deep breaths. Bernard rubbed his eyes as he replied, “Well, why do we scare ourselves? Are we sick in the head? Or is it more than that?” 

My head was spinning, “What do we do? Should we call someone?”

“Who would we call? The cops? The fucking ghostbusters?” he scoffed, “Anyway, it is really *weird* but I don’t think it’s a physical threat.” I shook my head and laughed darkly, “No, just a psychological one! We need to destroy that thing immediately.” Bernard narrowed his eyes, “Well, hey now let’s not do that too soon. Think about it. This thing is extraordinary.” 

“I don’t care! I don’t like it. I’m telling you, it’s cursed or something. God, I hate this horror movie bullshit. Just get rid of it, please.” Bernard’s ears reddened with anger, “Look there’s no such thing as curses or magic. It has to be some kind of illusion or something. I’ll get rid of it once I’m satisfied I’ve learned everything I can about it. Okay?” We argued late into the night but eventually I yielded. My dreams that night were filled with that story. I half fancied I heard someone crawling in my walls. 

The next morning when I arrived at the vicarage I saw Bernard was already there. His eyes were dark and exhausted. I guess mine looked the same. Dried leaves crunched underfoot as I stomped up the path. “Sleep okay?” I asked with a weary smile. Bernard was holding two large mugs of coffee. He handed one to me. “I slept horribly, of course.” He looked sheepishly down at his coffee. “Don’t be mad, but – I used it again. The story is different today. I wrote it down.” It took my brain a few moments to filter what I’d just heard. It was still the morning. I was slow. “You did *what*? Again? Alone? You idiot!” I took a deep breath. “Look, I’m sorry to yell, I’m just really worried. This is no joke. This thing is no toy!” 

“I know. It’s just it fascinates me. And I really don’t think it’s dangerous. Anyway, if you think I’m an idiot now. Well, just wait. I didn’t just look at it once today. I’ve used it three times this morning.” I nearly spat out my coffee. “What? Why?”

“I wanted to see what would happen.” He paused for effect. I rolled my eyes, “And?”

“Well, it’s just the same story. Identical. It seems to only change from day to day. I wonder what it’ll be tomorrow.”

I looked down at the sheet of paper he’d written on. His handwriting was messy. “It actually helps a lot to write it down. Manage to get it off my mind more easily,” he added.

It read:

*Last May Day I saw one of those old-fashioned roadside carnivals by the highway. My dog had recently died so I was feeling quite low. The sinking crimson sun loomed ominous. Red dusk-light twinkled off of the giant Ferris wheel. Next to it stood a rickety looking roller coaster. My fingers drummed on the steering wheel. I sighed. How long had it been since I’d had some fun? Soon I found my way to the grassy parking lot. Surprisingly, it was already dark. I followed the lights and stumbled through the wide, open entrance. Hundreds of people surrounded me; young couples on first dates and parents with their kids riding their shoulders. Their faces were all brightly painted. The smell of fresh popcorn and baked treats saturated the air. My ears were filled with the sounds of children laughing. My stomach grumbled. I made my way quickly to the nearest food stand. I was waiting patiently when I felt a tug on my shirt. Puzzled, I looked down. A small, pale faced girl with blonde pigtails looked mournfully up at me. “Don’t eat it,” she said quietly. I frowned, “I’m sorry?”*

*“Don’t. Eat. Anything.”*

*Confused, I stepped out of the line. “Now, what’s wrong? Are you ok? Should I help you find your –“*

*“You should leave. You’re in danger.”*

*I blinked. “Excuse me?” I snorted anxiously. She simply stared at me. She said again, “Please. You must listen. You must leave. Before they smell you.”*

*I swallowed hard. Just then I noticed the carnival lights dim. I looked up. My heart plummeted into my stomach. Everyone around me had suddenly stopped moving. Moms, dads, grandpas and aunts. No more delighted yells from the roller coaster. All stood silently. Their faces expressionless. My nerves burned from terror. The girl yelled, “Now now! Follow me!” She ran. I followed. As I ran I noticed the carnival was suddenly vast and labyrinthine. How had I gotten so far inside?* 

*With the girl’s help we made it to the entrance. As I made to leave I turned to face the girl. “Quickly!” I yelled holding my hand out. She shook her head slowly. “I can’t leave. It’s too late for that. Much too late. But you can leave! Now run! Run!” She screamed loudly at me with tears falling down her cheeks. The crowd of carnival goers were no longer motionless. They crept toward me like predators preparing to pounce. I ran. I ran for my life.*

*When I got back to my car the sun was back in the sky. It was at exactly the same position it had been the moment I’d laid eyes on that damned carnival. The carnival had vanished. What happened that day I’ll never understand. I stay away from that part of the highway. I never look out to the West when I drive. No matter how much popcorn I smell.*  

My brain hummed with concentration as I thought out loud, “Hmmm, well it’s certainly creepy. But it has no obvious connection to the previous story besides it being a horror story.”

“Yes, it’s a different voice. And again, it was like getting access to their memories. Or dreams.”

“I’d say ‘cursed nightmares’ but that’s just me.” 

Bernard rolled his eyes, “Come on! What? Ya think it’s possessed or something? It’s just a trick!” 
 
That night I still couldn’t sleep. It wasn’t just because I’d eaten about a pound of greasy fried chicken. I could not stop thinking about the heart-thumping horror. The thrill of the unknown. Frustrated, I kicked my duvet off and reached for my phone. I opened the Notes app and began to write. I wrote down the whole of the first story I’d witnessed. I scanned it once for egregious spelling errors. As soon as I’d finished, I felt a strange relief wash over me. Bernard was right. I finally managed to sleep.

As the morning sun climbed into the sky I got into my car. Soon I made my way to the vicarage and walked through into the hidden room. I saw my brother kneeling in front of the zoetrope. “Oh – Alice. I was about to try it out. How did you sleep?”

“Actually, a bit better. I did a bit of writing and it helped me get some shuteye. Also, I was wondering if I could try it first today?”

His eyebrow arched and he smiled smugly, “Oh, I thought you hate it? Said it’s evil.”

“I do. And it is. And yet. I keep thinking about what you said. About how it may reflect our own personal anxieties. I’ve been having some weird dreams lately. I’m curious. Maybe there’s some kind of common theme or object. If I can figure the message out, maybe I can understand what’s going on. What this thing is.” So, I fetched a table and chair. We set the zoetrope down. In the center of the table while I sat down in a wooden chair. I took a few deep breaths. Then Bernard wound the machine, and flicked it on. It was exactly as before. Once I looked into the spinning barrel I became paralyzed. Whispering voices filled my ears. Soon a new set of memories flooded my anaesthetized mind:

*“Daddy! There’s a thing in my closet!” I woke with a start as my son shook me hard. I sat up in bed quickly. I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and stretched. “Yes, my boy. What did you say?” I said groggily. “There’s a thing in my closet!” My son said in an excited whisper. I heard my wife mumble something incoherent into her pillow. I kissed her head gently and rolled out of bed. “Come on,” I said, taking hold of my son’s small hand. We walked down the darkened corridor. Soon we arrived at my son’s bedroom. Bright light spilled out past the open door. I lifted him into his bed. “Now –“ before I could finish he pointed excitedly at the walk-in closet. “There, daddy!” he shouted. Slowly, I stood. As I got closer to the closet I smelled something. It smelled like compost. Like moss or decaying plants. Suddenly two slimy vine-like tentacles burst through the closet door and wrapped around my torso. Within a second, I was ripped through the closet door violently. The door was smashed to pieces and cut my hand badly. I was covered in bruises and scratches. My head was ringing. I coughed. When the ringing in my ears subsided, I heard the screaming of a child. My child! My son was screaming for me. As I climbed to my feet I stopped dead. There, within the depths of my child’s walk-in closet, was a gigantic bulb of some kind of plant. It was large and green and covered in fine hairs. From the center of this bulb protruded hundreds of thin green vines. In an instant, many were now wrapped around my limbs. I was hoisted into the air. I screamed with terror and pain as I was slowly lowered. The bulb split down the middle revealing a gaping, slimy pink maw. I bellowed as its jaws loomed closer –*

It was like suddenly being thrown into ice cold water. I screamed, and almost fell off the chair. I blinked as my mind caught up with itself. I was back. Back as myself. I winced and yelled as white-hot pain leapt up my hand. I glanced down at my hand. It was bloodied and covered in scratches. The very same scratches the narrator had gotten. My eyes brimmed with tears as I looked up at a terrified Bernard. He fetched some gauze and antiseptic and soon my wounds were washed and covered. The whole time we didn’t speak. We both knew without needing the say anything. It was decided. The thing had to go. We were both standing staring at it when there was a loud knock at the door. We had been expecting a friend of ours. We’d asked her to help appraise the house.

We exited the room and locked the door. Bernard welcomed Lilly into the vicarage, “Hello! So good to see you again. Sorry, we aren’t as prepared as we should be,” he paused as he noticed a small blonde girl dressed as a princess hiding shyly behind Lilly. “Oh, looky here, there’s Princess Alison!” Bernard bowed deeply. Alison giggled. After a glass of water, we showed Lilly around the estate. It was only much later when we noticed Alison was missing. I felt a cold shiver and checked my pocket. The key was missing. I felt dizzy. It can’t be.

Immediately, I ran toward the hidden room. The door stood wide open! Alison was sitting in the chair. She was staring into that horrible thing while it spun and hummed. I ran in and knocked it clean off the table. It broke in half as it hit the ground. “Alison! Are you okay?” I said as I hugged her tightly. Her voice was nearly inaudible as she mumbled, “The nice priest. He gave it to me,” she held out the little gold key in her left hand. Then she stared into space. She did not respond at all after that. I looked down. Just like my right hand hers was covered in scratches and blood.

It was early the next morning when we got back to the vicarage. Bernard and I went straight into the hidden room. We carried the broken pieces of the zoetrope  outside and dumped them into a large metal barrel. Then we emptied a whole canister of gasoline into the barrel and set it alight. 

If only we had acted sooner, Alison wouldn’t have been hurt and we wouldn’t have lost Lilly as a friend. Bernard’s voice was sad and tired, “I’m so sorry. You were right. You’re always right.” We both stared at the flames. After a long while I said, “You know, I’ve been reflecting. And I think I figured out a common message to those stories,” Bernard looked at me as he lit another cigarette. I continued, “The message is: Nowhere is safe. The familiar cannot be trusted. Our anxieties cannot be ignored.” He took a drag. The sun rose on a cold, damp morning. The zoetrope crackled and smoldered. 

This experience has shaken something loose in my mind. Now my fears bubble to the surface constantly, and I do not sleep. The only way to release the pressure is to squeeze the fear out of my brain and onto paper. But even after that, a residue is left behind; forever a part of me. Now, it’s forever a part of you too.",1,1747295528.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

This has been my experience over 6 months and many different beans, including dak coferments, manhattan world class, and a bunch of local roasters.

I see a lot of people talk about this suppressing appetite and food noise etc etc. 

For me, I’ve been overweight for most of my life since I was a teenager and whereas I used to overeat as a teen most likely, I really don’t anymore. 

I’ve stayed the same weight since then, around 125kg - 130 kg and I can wear the same clothes I did as a teen haha. 

Despite multiple attempts to lose weight, exercise and “diet”. I’ve stayed the same size. 

I’m in my late twenties now and I actually eat very little. I’m quite often on 1500 calories or less day to day I’d say. Probably less than that is food. Most is probably from milk for coffees and matcha lattes etc. Not dieting though. 

it’s mostly out of laziness to make meals and depression that makes that laziness worse. But I genuinely don’t feel hungry often anyway. I’ll tend to go for one ready meal a day and maybe a brunch bar or something. Im not constantly snacking or anything in place of meals. I just don’t feel hungry. 

Was anyone else in the same boat and tried this? 

I’m hoping the insulin balancing side of it and stuff will help remind my metabolism that it needs to do some work. But I don’t feel I need it for suppression or food noise. 

I took my first injection the other day and haven’t felt hungry at all since but I often went 12 hours without caring about food anyway so it isn’t that unusual. ",2,1747295395.0,mounjarouk,0,0.75,False

So relationship anxiety has also been prevalent through my whole romantic life due to a number of issues I won't go into. 
I'm usually able to sit with most triggers and come to a place where I can start to rationalise again and basically be a normal functioning human again quite quickly.

However each and every month about a week out from my period, I get triggered by even the most tiny actions my partner will do. Like wanting to get coffee with a female friend, or even just taking himself out for dinner. Unlike the rest of the month, I just can't move through it. It takes like 5-8 hours to stop obsessing over the anxiety I'm feeling and be able to think about literally anything else. Anything that triggers me during that week feels completely unmovable and any amount of breathing or stretching or whatever rarely seems to make a difference. 

Only when I get my period do I realise what's been going on with me and everything starts to get easier again. I'm going to start tracking my period much more seriously so we can both prepare more. I see a therapist every fortnight.. 

But I'm just here to ask, how do y'all cope? What makes this even 5% easier to deal with? Any weird and wonderful recommendations are welcomed. Nothing is off the table hah. 

I'm just really tired of being in pain and what feels like self sabotaging my beautiful relationship every month 😅

I’ve decided to pick up the OGX Coconut Coffee Scrub & Wash—I’ve heard amazing things about the scent.

For those of you who’ve tried any of these combos (or all!), which one do you think pairs best with the scrub & wash? Does the OGX cream give a more cohesive scent experience, or do the others outperform it in terms of hydration, texture, and scent longevity?

I’m especially curious about how well the scents layer—do vanilla or cocoa blend well with the coconut coffee vibe, or do they clash? Also, if one feels noticeably better on the skin or absorbs more nicely, I’d love to know.

I’m just so happy cause today my coworkers and I are gonna go to the farmers market together and some part of me just wonders if they put me in the office all day for that reasons. It became a thing last year to go when I started here. But like we made plans last week to go as well. And I’m just so excited. 

I’m also really thankful cause they’ve come to know very well that I have a Starbucks addiction. They know my order and have gotten me gift cards and coffee before  

I just feel so lucky to have them. Working with them makes me never wanna leave. And I hope I can continue this job after I graduate. Right now it kinda seems like it’s heading that way so unless God throws a curve ball at me, I can’t wait to spend my days working with them.

I (f-35) met a woman (f-32 - we'll call her kay) i felt sorry for crying on tiktok one day over not getting hired because of her past. Me being a manager, thought wow! Her post seem very innocent and just has bad luck in life. I may be able to help. I can interview her and if it goes well, I'll hire her. I work in retail, so charisma is really needed and she had plenty of it. Interview went well and found out we had a mutual friend. A friend (f-35) i have known for over 20 years who is a pastor's wife. She is also one of those people, who never got in trouble, is smart, kind and beautiful. I did find out that they had a falling out, but it wasn't a biggie but she did leave that church.
Which I didn't think too much of, as I didn't see my friend that way. She's not the type to have drama attached to her name. But again, I haven't spoken to her in a while. I'm also very aware that Kay has a platform and I'm careful with what I say to her. As I'm a bit of joker, but I like roasting (only the close people to me)


Fast forward, I hired her based of her her experience, charisma and eagerness to learn. I did ask my 2ic, who prepared me about her and said to becareful. She mentioned she has some serious psychological issues, like depression and anxiety. I told her, that is fine. Gave her a little run down on things that have happened in my life, yet look where i am. I am in full support of her, and knowing how my team are, i knew they would support her too. Little did I know, it was worst than that.

She started spreading lies between my team, and slowly turning them against each other. Telling them to tell me that she is doing a good job, or not to tell me that they've been talking about certain things. All her stories or manipulating tactics started not to work on them. But I was still not aware of what was happening.

One day we had a sale, but also a campaign where we all work towards a bonus for all of us which involved signing up people. I asked her to not say that you don't need to sign up, but our job is to make sure we are signing people up. It keeps customers up to date on products and sales. She took my words and started telling customers to sign up so that they can save, which wasn't true as the sale was for everyone. A customer pulled her up on it, then she was super offended about being called out. 

Fast forward to a couple days later. We have a xmas break up at a local beach/lake where my team and I took food and beverages for a pot luck. She turned up late and told people, she wasn't gonna come. No reason or anything but she was feeling put off about the customer calling her out and somehow it was my fault.

She came to see me a couple days later and she said she didn't wanna come as she didn't feel comfortable, but she did anyway. She also thanked me for everything that I do for her and my organising of the store etc as it made it easier for her to navigate. Plus a box of her favourite cookies with a big hug. At this stage I'm like ""wow, that's so nice of you."" 

2 days later, she trying to find cover for her shift in our group chat, (Which at the time I wasn't a part of, as i don't want people to think that I am bullying them. Based of being accused of it for asking the whole team to make sure they spell names correctly and a team member got offended and accused me of bullying her, cause it was a mistake she made.) She knew this btw, as i had explained to her, it's better this way.
Anywho, my 2ic messaged me and asked if she had let me know. I said no! And this wasn't the first time she had done this btw. I messaged her, ( I'm still in bed at this point) I asked her to let me know in future if you're unable to make your shift. She quickly went into defense mode and started saying that I was micromanaging her and I have a habbit of doing so. However she had only been with us a a month and a bit, so I'm trying to keep things in order and aligned with company policy. 
I messaged her back and said I don't appreciate the way you're speaking to me. She replied with, the ""same etc""

I'm so confused at this point. She has done a full 180.
I seeked advice from another manager, who suggested reaching out to our area manager to keep them in the loop. I did that, their response was to sit her down with a coffee and see what's going on. As this is all out of the blue. 

She comes to work, by this point I am a bit nervous. These are conversations that are uncomfortable to be in. I tool her to a cafe and asked her where she wanted to sit. Outside, inside, down by work, in my car (please note: I've dropped her off multiple times, so my car wasn't too unusual for us. She said she didn't mind and I wanted her to be happy and calm, not stressed. Her guard was up, I could tell.

I started off with, okay what's up. Talk to me. She started off with I don't be offended, but I think your trauma need to be dealt with. You have trauma blah blah. For 1, I am shocked, as that has nothing to do with this. I said oh I'm not bothered, my unfortunate past happened and I am stronger today because I don't let it affect me. It's been years since it happened, so I've dealt with it. Then I mentioned, our area manager had suggested we do this, so that we can make things better etc. 
This flipped a switch in her brain, she went straight into defense and was like you need to heal, you need to heal, do you want me to.pray for you? Lets pray. Repeated iver and over again. Her tone and demeanor was different. I've never seen this side of her before. I was scared. She started yelling at me, I tried to speak and she would yell over me. I have never felt so small in my life and no one in my team has ever yelled at me before and vice versa. I don't  like to raise my voice. Not even the people in maccas drive thru can hear me speak 😆 all I could think, is this really happening? She started throwing shade at me for being accused of bullying. I'm like what? Her words were fast and sharp. A much more confident speaker than myself. Accusations of lying  repeating stop lying, stop lying! I couldn't even get a word in. Probably not even a breath. Lol
I was wishing my 2ic would come out and hear this, cause I have no proof and I don't know what to do. Kay ended up saying, we need a mediator, I'm gonna call (area manager) 

We jump out of my  car, I go upstairs and Kay jumps on the phone. I call my 2ic and quickly explain what just happened. My 2ic has worked with me for over 2 years at this point. I'm like, I don't know what to say, but I am so uncomfortable right now. Kay barges in, and straight away she tells my 2ic not to losten to me. Im a liar and im just lying to her. My 2ic responded, ""I would believe her (me) over anyone anyday""  My AM calls me and asks me to close the store. They will be here in the morning and they will get to the bottom of it. Kay leaves, and I close up the store for the day. 

Next day, is actually OK. My AM is there, has heard my version, her version then my 2ics version. They do up a report then involve HR! He asked if we could all work together, if it will be ok. I hesitated cause I was worried for my team to be around her. I was scared. He said my 2ic is fine to work with her and I said ""okay, if she can do it, then I can too"" All is okay, cause I know I haven't done anything but the words she said, stuck with me. I'm hearing her voice, repeat in my head over and over again. I'm a liar, I'm a bully, I'm this and that.

Next day is a Friday, which is my rostered day off. My 2ic is on shift with Kay. She calls me at about 10am, saying ""she needs to leave, Kay has to go"" I have never heard my 2ic panic or sound so scared before. I asked what happened and she said. She's reading her statement that she wrote up about Kay around how she was weary of kayla as she likes to post lies about people on tik tok, including Mz police, churches and Work and income, and how she is careful around her out of fear she will post about her or anyone around her to someone on the phone. The letter my 2ic deleted after printing it out to give to my AM. As the letter was private and Kay resd it in front of her as an intimidating tactic. But my 2ic is yound and not used to people like Kay.
I tell her to go outside and catch her breath. I got on the phone to the AM. Then I get a message from my team member who just got to work. 
He asked me to call him. I called him and he sounded scared. I asked him what's wrong and he said Kay started questioning him and she was telling him not to believe anything we say and what have we said about her to him. Keep in mind, this is a private serious matter being dealt with by HR. So we haven't spoken to him at all about the matter. She fully told him her version but was also lecturing him about being late when he was 40mins early and accusing  him of not greeting her like he normally does. (FYI. He waited for her to look up so he could say hello which he does everyday and she didn't look up, so he went up stairs)

He said that she was scaring him and he doesn't want to be there. So I had to tell him to go out by our 2ic. I get on the phone again to AM to explain and he calls Kay to shut the store. Minutes go by, I check in with my team to see if their okay they said they're waiting for her to leave, so they can grab their belongings inside. She walks out, sees them in their car and goes back inside. They call me back and say she hasn't left yet. So I tell them to wait there and I'll come down. I go down and I let them in the store. I told them go straight up and don't say anything. I'll wait at the door for them. While I'm waiting, she's talking to me about how Jesus won't forgive me, I have the spirit of jesebel and that I should stop lying. I didn't utter one word, but she talked the whole time. When they walked back down with their stuff, she turned her focus to them. She started accusing them of lying about her and that's not nice. 

So far all of us have been accused of lying. We get outside, I lock the door and walk them to their cars. My 2ic is shaking as if she was in Antarctica and my team member is feeling nauseous. Another team member is walking down the road with her partner . We chat for 2mins and the Kay comes walking out the store up to us and I tell them to walk and don't say a word. At this point I'm scared of implications them, cause she has a way of flipping our words. She followed us and started talking to TMs boyfriend saying, he doesn't know her and if he did, he would love her. He kept telling her to leave him alone but she kept following us until we crossed the road. She yelled ""why are yous bullying me?"" She stood there looking like a victim which was sad to see but it's all part of her scheme.

Her first tiktok goes up after this. Accusing me of bullying her and that I forced her to lie to customers. This blows up and I get hate on the internet. My store was getting bad reviews and I had to keep showing up for my team. Even though I was struggling with what was true or not. Cause at this point even I believe what she is saying. It took a whole and a lot of dissecting of facts from messages and how my team speak of me to get to where I am now mentally. 

I reached out to the mutual friend of mine about her. I told her, I'm having problems and I wanted to understand why it was happening. She told me, she's been suffering for the last 2 years because she did the same thing to her. Accused her of bullying and lying. Then she started showing me receipts of their encounter and I was shocked. More of her past victims came to share their stories and it was all too familiar. Some of these victims are from situations 12 years ago and they were relieved to get it off their chest cause she really ruined their lives. Some people and families left town and where we live is super small. 26k people here. I went to the police station to see if I can get a trespass order for my home as she lives around the corner from me and I was worried about what she will do.

This all happened 6 months ago and now she is posting again. Just when we thought it was over. Things about narcissist and jezebel and saying I manipulate my team. Update coming soon.",1,1747293626.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

I'm planning on moving to Egypt soon (Cairo or Alexandria, haven't decided yet). I'm not specifically looking to get married there, but I'm not closed off to the idea either, so I would like to know more about the cultural norms around meeting people for marriage.

For context, I'm a European Muslim woman in my early twenties. I grew up in a very liberal Muslim community and I'm afraid that what I was taught about getting to know people for marriage is not acceptable for religious Egyptians and that they would percieve me as being easy or not looking for something serious. That's why I would have a few questions:

1. Is going out alone for coffee/meal in a public place okay? Or should there always be a third person there? 

2. If a man is interested in marriage, will he ask for my father's number early on?

3. Are the men who approach women in public/restaurants/coffee shops always just looking for smth not halal/not serious? 

4. I'm not shy and wouldn't mind approaching someone I like. Is this acceptable, or would it maybe be taken the wrong way?

5. I sometimes feel weird when Middle Eastern men show interest in me because I assume it has something to do with me being white or a foreigner (I can often tell this is the case by things they say). This always feels really uncomfortable and weird, and it makes me overly careful when it comes to guys from the ME because I don't know if they like me or just have some weird thing for white women or think we're easy (another common stereotype). Is there a way to figure this out in the beginning and would this be a concern in Egypt? 

6. Is it normal for family members to ask if you want to meet their son/brother/cousin? When I was at the Azhar mosque a woman asked me if I want to meet her son and I got scared and went away lol, I'm not used to that.

7. Lastly, and I hope this doesn't come off as arrogant, but I'm well educated and financially stable. Most places I went to in Egypt, people are really poor and not that educated. I obviously don't look down on them, but that's not what I'm looking for. Are there places where I can meet people who have a more similar background to mine (more in terms of education rather than financial)? This goes for friendships as well, as I would like to meet girls with similar interests to hang out with, but it's difficult as I will be working from home. My Arabic is so-so, but I'll be learning there inshallah.

Some of my questions may sound silly, but Egypt is very different from what I'm used to, so I wanted to make sure. And advice is welcome :)

A little story from me:I was in line at a coffee shop recently when the guy in front of me had his card declined. He looked embarrassed and was about to cancel his order, so I stepped in and said, “I’ve got it.” Just a coffee—but the way he looked at me, you’d think I handed him a miracle.
He kept asking how to pay me back, and I just told him, “No worries—just pay it forward.”He smiled, genuinely, and walked out a little lighter. And honestly? So did I.
It reminded me how small kindnesses can leave a big impact…

1kn241i,https://i.redd.it/vzk1sxhccw0f1.jpeg,Help! 450ml/15oz coffee for this cake? What kind of coffee?,"Hi Friends!
I’m making this cake for my sons 3rd Birthday this weekend. (It’s CupCake JemmaCaramel Cornflake Brownie Layer Cake)
I’ve purchased this recipe online, however it specifies 450g (which is about 15oz) of “cooled coffee” -typically for brownie or chocolate cakes I’m used to adding some instant coffee powder to enhance the chocolate but in the recipe video she uses a jug full of coffee. 

My question is, would this be a watered down long black? How can I properly understand the ratio of coffee to water? In the video the coffee looks like watered down coca-cola, it’s not jet black and you can see caramel/brown colour as she pours but it’s a dark brown when it’s in the jug, so I know it can’t be super strong but it’s kinda dark. I paid for the downloadable recipe hoping it would provide more information however it doesn’t specify at all about the coffee.

Intuitively, what would you guys be using in this instance? Mostly water with a shot of coffee in it? I’m having trouble discerning how she made the coffee, whether it was instant coffee or not - since this is for a 3 year old’s birthday party obviously I’m wary about how much caffeine will be in the cake.
I am having  another birthday for his friends (toddlers) next weekend too so I was going to make this cake again, but I’m not sure - depending on the coffee ratio~

## Selatapura, Nusantara Outre-Terre

## Kampung Prasetyopuri, Malapert Crater, Luna

[**Kopitiam Chang'e**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/CoffeeShopSG.JPG) was buzzing at all hours of the day, being the most popular stall in one of [**Kampung Prasetyopuri's**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Borneo_rainforest.jpg) only hawker centres. The [**curry roti canai and teh tarik**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Roti_Telur_and_Teh_Tarik.jpg) were mediocre at best, [**Minerva Céleste Chevalier-Lin Yuemei**](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1i5jerx/roleplay_red_moon_blue_queen_au_clair_de_la_lune/) quietly thought, but she couldn't deny that it was nice to have an actual egg for once instead of the vat-printed protein substitute that she had been served at her 6th Arrondissement budget hotel in Shackleton Crater yesterday. That the villages along the crater rim were uniquely licensed to raise chickens and conduct small-scale [rice-and-freshwater-fish agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice-fish_system) certainly made the locals here quite happy, coupled with their unique [**lunar sericulture**](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1ilzp8d/roleplay_nusantara_raya_year_sixtytwo_aikyampura/) business making them very rich kampung-dwellers. Minerva secretly wondered how many of the aunties and uncles lounging about the kopitiam nursing their kopi and teh were actually billionaires who retired to Selatapura - the lower gravity supposedly helped to age gracefully - and how many became billionaires from shipping up the gravity well in Nusantara Outre-Terre's initial boom. 

One slightly younger-looking (albeit appropriately grizzled and unkempt) uncle in particular though, clad in a stained wifebeater and the ubiquitous faded coveralls pulled down halfway to his waist, stood out among the patrons, having drawn himself a small crowd that seemed to hang on to his every word. Intrigued, Minerva shuffled her seat a bit closer and tuned up her auditory implants to listen in. 

[**""No shit, there I was,""**](https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/zaeed-massani.jpg) he declared, slamming his mug of kopi onto the aluminum table for emphasis and earning a pointed but unheeded glare from the kopitiam shopkeep. ""All stacked up outside the airlock with Chrissy in one hand"" - here he hefted a beat-up boarding shotgun, clearly very illegal and clearly one that has seen better days - ""and a heat axe in the other, two men to my front and six to the rear, all with the best gear that Clandestine Directorate money can buy, a caniform drone to lug the sampling equipment, and not a single clue what we were in for."" 

At this point the man slowly dragged his gaze around his table, one scarred-over eye clearly replaced with a synth implant while the other seemed to burn with barely-suppressed fury. Minerva shuddered from the next table over. 

""So Yusuf at the front cycles the airlock - big French African bastard he was - and then Truc and I immediately rush through. Or at least we're supposed to, but Truc, the fuckin' *bodoh*, stops dead in front of the airlock and I smack right into his skinny ass. I'm about to smoke him out, until I look up and see what he's so busy staring at: the whole fuckin' dome has been turned into a dense jungle - not a comforting one like this here kampung, filled with familiar trees and plants and whatnot, but someone's Garden that we're so very obviously not supposed to be in."" He took a long swig from his kopi, smacking his lips with appreciation before continuing. 

""*Wallahi*, nothing about that place felt right. The trees were wrong, the bushes were wrong, the flowers were wrong, the damn air was wrong. Couldn't even see the roof of the dome, that's how thick the foliage was, and it was all the wrong shade of green or whatnot, too. Every one of my senses were screaming at me to run, run as fast as I could."" He paused here, an ironic smile splitting his face like a Pontianak. 

""But the pay…a sultan's ransom, I tell you, and conditional on retrieving readings and samples from the centre of the dome, nothing less. Told myself that nobody was shooting at me yet, just a quick jaunt through the woods and back with some of Nusantara's finest - or most expendable, really - watching my six. That's what I told 'em too, knocked some sense into Truc and Anurak - Thai kid, ran when the vampire king took over and did a stint in Rio with the Penerakas - and then pushed us forward.""

Someone handed the man another mug of kopi and a plate of chicken satay, payment-in-kind for his story and entertainment for the kopitiam crowd. He grunted in thanks, tearing into the skewers and audibly swallowing. 

""Wasn't so bad at first, y'know. It was like the jungle was making a path for us, every step cushioned by soft moss and the vines ahead literally slithering away. Thought it was just my eye playing tricks on me, though I wasn't sure which one - hah! - so I didn't say nothin', just kept marching forward with Chrissy at the ready. Took about an hour, though the deeper we went the weirder it got. Flowers seemingly turning their heads to follow us along, tree trunks creaking even though there shouldn't be any wind inside a tented crater, moments of hushed silence when our footsteps didn't make a sound, that sorta thing. And this constant sense of being watched. Creepy shit, you understand. Weird part was, the whole time we were heading into the jungle, we didn't see a single animal. No humans either, though we sometimes stumbled across a half-buried glove or flashcrete rubble from whatever was in the dome before……before the garden, I guess.""

Here he grimaced, scratching absentmindedly at a scar on his forehead as he took another sip of kopi. 

""But when we got to the centre, that's when things went sideways. That's where we found the Vine of Vines, the big *bhenchod* of vines itself, coiled tightly around what our maps were telling us was the containment structure for the dome's fusion plant. It was definitely moving alright, ceaselessly slithering like Anantashesha himself, all while our encounter suit Geiger counters were screaming in our ears - the fucker was *feeding* off the radiation from the fusion plant, crackling and rippling and morphing right in front of us. And then Truc took his heat axe to it - we needed a sample, and this mother of all vines was clearly what we were supposed to be sampling - and *wah lau*, that's when it all went downwell.""

The man frowned, as If recollecting himself or digging through some repressed memories. Minerva knew the look - she had seen the same expressions in the mirror whenever the ghosts of the Rio underhives came back to haunt her.

""The Vine **screamed**. *Chao chibai* it screamed like a motherfucker. And then immediately afterwards Truc began screaming too, because a vine from the Vine had lashed out and smashed his knees in, leaving him howling on the ground, poor bastard. Chrissy was up and spitting incendiary shot in an instant, and not a moment too soon, because the rest of the Garden had come alive - er, more alive - and started trying to kill us all. Saw Yusuf get his visor get melted through by a spray of acid, and then a flower literally forced itself down his throat when he tried to throw his helmet off. He died twitching as a dozen shoots exploded from between the joints on his suit. Anurak tried running, but got nailed to a tree by a burst of thorns as big as my forearm. Looked a bit like Jesus on the cross, peace be upon Him, in a fucked up sorta way.

""Anyways I knew that it was time to go, so I grabbed the Vine cutting that Truc had dropped and chucked it onto the caniform. Was gonna grab Truc, too, but the vines got to him first - dragged him into the depths of the Garden. He kept screaming, begging for us to help him. I muted him as I high-tailed it out of here, the poor *sohai*. Anurak too, at least until the flowers got to him - last I saw he was convulsing like a man possessed after breathing in a cloud of glowing pollen that they had somehow vomited into his bubble helmet. Maybe he *was* possessed. I didn't stick around to find out.""

The crowd around him for the most part recoiled as the man swept his gaze around once more, visibly horrified yet engrossed, like onlookers watching a slow-motion train wreck. 

""If the Garden was inviting as we entered, on the way out it was fighting like hell to keep us from leaving. Chrissy kept firing until I ran out of shells, and then she joined my heat axe in bashing my way through the pissed-off vines and blooms. One by one the other men died slow, terrible deaths - smashed about until all their bones were shattered, impaled by thorns and sharp branches, body exploding from the inside in a riot of colours, choking on spores…horrible. It was just me and Syed in the end - quiet guy from the kampung, quick with his axe - when suddenly we heard a scream from behind. It was Truc's voice, begging us to come back and get him out, spluttering and shouting and hollering and saying that he had gotten free but his legs were out, and that he needed help to escape, that there was no way we could leave him behind. I disagreed, of course - Truc was already dead, this was some trick being played on us, but Syed turned back, shouting no man left behind, that Truc needed us. 

""Dumb bastard. He got swallowed back up by the Garden, even as I kept running for the airlock with the caniform drone sprinting alongside me with my payday on its back. I muted his channel on the comms - muted all of them, actually, just in case. And then just as I got the airlock opened, with a dozen trip-mines tossed out behind me for good measure, I turned back and saw…it. 

""Human shape, human voice - Truc, then Syed, then Yusuf, then Anurak, then the others, all begging for help, begging for me to save them, endlessly screaming. But I knew as soon as I laid eyes upon it at the edge of the Garden. I knew.

## [""Whatever it was, it wasn't human no more.""](https://imgur.com/a/Shy3mRm)

At that, the man slammed his mug down onto the table, startling the wide-eyed crowd and shaking Minerva from her entranced, horrified stare. 

""Anyways,"" he continued, ""I was the only survivor, so I made off with a fat payday after I dropped the Vine samples off and got a very thorough decontamination. Clandestine Directorate threatened me with a long walk out a short airlock if I didn't keep my mouth shut, stupid *anjings*, but they can't touch ol' **Zaeed Mentari**.""

He thumped his chest with pride. Minerva rolled her eyes when he wasn't looking. 

""And so, ladies and gentlemen,"" Zaeed finished, ""that's why Hyginus crater is off-limits. Dome's all fogged up so they can't see in from the outside, and the interior's a haunted deathtrap."" He shrugged. ""I *tahan* worse, all things considered. Decent job."" 

Minerva shivered despite the heat, quickly downed her teh tarik, and walked off with the rest of the crowd as they dispersed, storytime over.

## Clandestine Directorate - Persekutuan Nusantara

### Incident report - _WALLED_GARDEN_20830712_

**Summary**

* Former neo-Pagan colony ""Pearl's Hope"" in Hyginus crater confirmed to be overrun by anomalous semi-sentient plantlife phenomena
* Mercenary team contracted to reconnoiter Pearl's Hope nearly entirely killed or missing in action, with one survivor recovered
* Tests of retrieved samples of central Mother Vine confirm phenomena originated from the Garden of Eden
* Means of spread uncertain; working hypothesis suggests Mother Vine cutting smuggled into colony by undercover Garden cultist, perversion unknown [87% confidence]
* Mother Vine appears to feed off of radiation from colony fusion power plant; abnormally high rate of evolution and mutation detected compared to baseline observations from Garden of Eden
* Garden constructs appear to mimic behaviour, voices of humans ""assimilated"" or otherwise captured and/or killed within the Garden space; recorded actions suggest some level of sentience and understanding of human behaviour
* **Hypothesis:** Garden only became hostile in reaction to an attack; possibly benign unless provoked?
* **Recommendation:** full quarantine of Hyginus crater to be enforced through deadly force, 10 kilometre exclusion zone to be demarcated; destruction of Pearl's Hope may result in inadvertent uncontrolled and unpredictable spread of Mother Vine remains from explosive decompression, with high likelihood of rampant infestation across cislunar space or beyond",3,1747292843.0,worldpowers,1,1.0,False
1kn1z6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVpnEng/comments/1kn1z6h/proxy_vs_vpn/,Proxy vs VPN,"In today's digital landscape, protecting your online privacy and accessing geo-restricted content has become increasingly important. Two popular tools that help with these issues are proxies and VPNs (Virtual Private Networks). While they might seem similar at first glance—both hide your IP address—they function differently and serve distinct purposes.

I've spent countless hours researching and testing both technologies, and I'm here to break down the key differences, help you decide which one is right for your needs, and introduce you to BrightData—one of the leading providers in the proxy space.

# What Are Proxies?

A proxy server acts as an intermediary between your device and the internet. When you connect to a website through a proxy, your request goes to the proxy server first, which then forwards it to the target website. The website sees the proxy's IP address, not yours, effectively masking your identity.

# Types of Proxies

There are several types of proxies, each designed for specific use cases:

# HTTP Proxies

These work specifically with web pages that use the HTTP protocol. They're configured in your browser settings and only hide your IP for specific web traffic. I remember when I first used an HTTP proxy to access region-restricted YouTube videos during a business trip—it was like unlocking a door I didn't even know existed!

# SOCKS Proxies

Unlike HTTP proxies, SOCKS proxies can handle various types of traffic beyond web browsing, including email, FTP, and P2P applications. They're more versatile but typically slower than HTTP proxies.

# Residential Proxies

These use IP addresses assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to real residential devices. They appear as regular users to websites, making them harder to detect and block. This is where providers like BrightData excel, offering over 72 million residential IPs across 195 countries.

# Datacenter Proxies

Created in bulk in data centers, these proxies are fast and cost-effective but more easily identified as proxies by sophisticated websites. They're great for less sensitive tasks where speed matters more than anonymity.

# What Are VPNs?

A Virtual Private Network creates an encrypted tunnel for all your internet traffic. When you connect to a VPN, your data is encrypted before leaving your device and is then routed through a remote server before reaching its destination.

# Key Components of VPNs

# Encryption

This is the **biggest difference** between proxies and VPNs. VPNs encrypt all your data, making it unreadable to anyone who might intercept it—including your ISP, government agencies, or hackers on public Wi-Fi.

# Tunneling Protocols

VPNs use various protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard, or IKEv2 to establish secure connections. Each has its own strengths in terms of security and speed.

# Server Networks

Most VPN providers maintain servers in multiple countries, allowing you to appear as if you're browsing from different locations. This is similar to proxies but with the added security of encryption.

# Head-to-Head: Proxy vs VPN Comparison

# Security Features

**VPNs**: Provide end-to-end encryption for all internet traffic, protecting your data from eavesdropping. This is crucial when using public Wi-Fi or handling sensitive information.

**Proxies**: Typically don't offer encryption (with some exceptions like HTTPS proxies). They simply mask your IP address without securing the data itself.

I learned this distinction the hard way once while traveling. Using a free proxy at a hotel, I checked my email without realizing the vulnerability—a mistake I quickly corrected by switching to a VPN!

# Privacy Protection

**VPNs**: Reputable VPN providers maintain strict no-logs policies, meaning they don't track or store information about your online activities.

**Proxies**: Many proxy services, especially free ones, log user data and might even sell it to third parties. There are exceptions, of course, with premium providers offering better privacy practices.

# Speed and Performance

**VPNs**: The encryption process can slow down your connection, though high-quality VPNs minimize this impact.

**Proxies**: Generally faster than VPNs since they don't encrypt data, but speeds vary widely depending on the proxy type and provider.

# Cost Considerations

**VPNs**: Usually require a subscription, typically ranging from $3 to $12 per month depending on features and length of commitment.

**Proxies**: Range from free (but often unreliable and potentially unsafe) to premium services with various pricing models. Business-grade proxy providers like BrightData often use bandwidth-based pricing.

# Ease of Use

**VPNs**: Modern VPNs feature user-friendly apps with one-click connections for various devices.

**Proxies**: Setup can range from simple browser extensions to more complex configurations requiring technical knowledge.

# When to Use a Proxy

# Web Scraping and Data Collection

Proxies shine when it comes to automated data gathering. They allow you to distribute requests across multiple IPs, avoiding rate limits and blocks from target websites.

A developer friend of mine runs a price comparison service and relies heavily on residential proxies to collect accurate pricing data from e-commerce sites. Without them, his scrapers would be blocked within minutes!

# Accessing Geo-Restricted Content

If you need to access region-specific content without high-security requirements, proxies can be a lightweight solution. They're particularly useful for checking how websites appear to users in different countries.

# Load Balancing

Organizations use proxies to distribute network traffic, improving performance and reducing the risk of service disruptions.

# Corporate Use Cases

Companies use proxies to monitor employee internet usage, filter content, and enforce security policies. They also help businesses verify ads appear correctly in different regions.

# Securing Public Wi-Fi Connections

VPNs are essential when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks at coffee shops, airports, or hotels. They encrypt your data, protecting it from potential hackers on the same network.

# Complete Anonymous Browsing

When privacy is your primary concern, VPNs offer more comprehensive protection by encrypting all your internet traffic, not just specific applications.

# Bypassing Government Censorship

In countries with internet restrictions, VPNs help users access blocked websites and services while keeping their activities private from authorities.

# Remote Work Security

With the rise of remote work, VPNs have become standard for securely connecting to company networks from outside the office. They ensure sensitive business data remains protected during transmission.

# BrightData: A Leading Solution for Proxy Needs

When it comes to premium proxy services, BrightData (formerly Luminati Networks) stands out as an industry leader. Here's why they're worth considering for your proxy needs:

# What Makes BrightData Stand Out

# Extensive IP Network

BrightData boasts over 72 million residential IPs across 195 countries, 700,000+ datacenter IPs, and 7 million mobile IPs. This massive network provides unmatched flexibility for location-specific tasks.

# Ethical Sourcing

Unlike some providers with questionable practices, BrightData ethically sources their residential IPs with user consent, maintaining compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

# Advanced Features

Their proxy management platform offers precise targeting (down to city level), automatic IP rotation, and robust APIs for seamless integration with your existing systems.

# Reliability and Uptime

With 99.99% uptime guarantees and 24/7 expert support, BrightData provides enterprise-grade stability for business-critical operations.

# BrightData's Proxy Network Offerings

# Residential Proxies

Perfect for accessing geo-restricted content, market research, and bypassing sophisticated anti-bot systems. These appear as regular users to target websites.

# Datacenter Proxies

Ideal for high-volume, less sensitive tasks where speed is crucial. They offer the fastest connections at a lower cost compared to residential proxies.

# ISP Proxies

A hybrid option combining the speed of datacenter proxies with the legitimacy of residential IPs. They're hosted on Internet Service Provider networks, offering a great balance for many use cases.

# Mobile Proxies

Essential for mobile app testing, ad verification on mobile platforms, and accessing mobile-specific content. These use real 3G/4G/5G connections.

# Real-World Applications

I've seen BrightData's proxies successfully deployed for various business applications:

* **E-commerce brands** monitoring competitors' pricing strategies
* **Market research firms** collecting data across multiple regions
* **Ad verification** companies ensuring campaigns display correctly worldwide
* **SEO agencies** tracking search rankings in different locations
* **Travel companies** gathering accurate pricing from booking sites

One particularly impressive case was a retail analytics firm that switched to BrightData after struggling with constant blocks from e-commerce sites. Their data collection success rate jumped from 65% to over 95%, dramatically improving their competitive insights.

# Making the Right Choice for Your Needs

Choosing between a proxy and a VPN depends entirely on your specific requirements. Here are some questions to consider:

# Questions to Ask Yourself

1. Do you need to secure all your internet traffic, or just specific applications?
2. Is encryption a priority, or is simply hiding your IP address sufficient?
3. What's your technical comfort level with setting up and managing these tools?
4. What's your budget for privacy and security tools?
5. Do you need to perform high-volume automated tasks like web scraping?

# Scenarios and Recommendations

**For general privacy and security**: Choose a VPN. It provides comprehensive protection for all your online activities, especially on public networks.

**For web scraping and data collection**: A proxy service like BrightData is ideal. Their extensive network and specialized tools are designed for these tasks.

**For bypassing geo-restrictions on streaming services**: Both can work, but a VPN might be more reliable for popular platforms that actively block proxies.

**For business intelligence gathering**: BrightData's proxy solutions offer the scale and reliability needed for enterprise-level insights.

# Combining Proxies and VPNs for Maximum Security

In some cases, using both technologies together makes sense. For example, you might use a VPN for general browsing security while employing specialized proxies for specific tasks like data collection or managing multiple accounts.

# Conclusion

While proxies and VPNs share the ability to mask your IP address, they serve different purposes in the digital privacy landscape. VPNs offer comprehensive security through encryption but may sacrifice some speed. Proxies provide faster connections and specialized capabilities for tasks like web scraping but lack encryption.

For individual users concerned with overall privacy and security, a quality VPN is usually the better choice. For businesses needing to gather competitive intelligence, manage multiple accounts, or perform location-specific testing, a premium proxy service like BrightData delivers the necessary tools and reliability.

Whichever solution you choose, remember that the free options often come with hidden costs—from poor performance to potential privacy risks. Investing in a reputable service provides peace of mind and consistently better results.

BrightData stands as a particularly strong recommendation for those with professional proxy needs, offering an unmatched combination of network size, reliability, and ethical practices in the industry.

I became Mrs. Sinclair when the F1 legend married me as revenge on so-called true love.  
  
For three years, Kailen and Ruby couldn't stay away from each other. Lingering touches during press events, inside jokes in interviews that made headlines the next day.  
  
My Instagram comments were brutal: ""She's just the stand-in."" ""Poor girl doesn't realize she's the backup plan.""  
  
I never made scenes. Just smiled for the cameras, told reporters ""we're very happy"" when they asked about the latest photos of Kailen and Ruby at some rooftop bar.  
  
Then I got pregnant. I terminated without telling him.  
  
When he found out, Kailen's face went white, then red. He slammed his fist against the wall of our Malibu home.  
  
""What the hell were you thinking?"" His voice broke.  
  
""Why would you do that?""  
  
I touched his face—the same jawline as his brother's—and said quietly, ""Because this was never real, Kailen.""  
  
The truth hung between us.  
  
""I can't have a baby with someone I don't love.""  
  
His eyes widened as he finally understood.  
  
""It was always Jayden for me. It's always been Jayden.""  
  
\--  
  
Everyone knew Kailen Sinclair only married me to make Ruby Miller jealous.  
  
They'd broken up before the wedding, with Ruby storming off to Europe out of jealousy.  
  
Kailen didn't chase after her—instead, he put a ring on my finger.  
  
I walked down the aisle in a designer dress that never felt like mine, marrying a man whose heart belonged to someone else.  
  
The gossip sites all predicted the same ending: ""Once Ruby returns, he'll dump her faster than a pit stop tire change.""  
  
But something unexpected happened in our third year of marriage. Kailen seemed to actually fall for me.  
  
He'd bring me coffee in bed, kiss me awake on lazy Sundays, and smile when I'd playfully demand his attention.  
  
During our most intimate moments, tangled in our sheets, he'd whisper against my skin, ""Sweetheart, let's have a baby. A sweet one, just like you.""  
  
We began feeling like any normal couple in love.  
  
Until the day I found out I was pregnant.  
  
Before I could tell Kailen, Ruby Miller came back to the States.  
  
And just like that, they got back together.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
It happened to be the day their Harvard reunion at some overpriced Manhattan bar the night Ruby Miller came back to the State.  
  
Everyone was gossiping about how her family's tech empire had collasped overnight. She was apparently desperate for cash.  
  
When Kailen guided me through the crowd, we spotted Blake Reynolds—heir to Reynolds Petroleum—shoving drinks toward Ruby at the bar.  
  
""Another shot equals another hundred grand loan,"" Blake drawled, his Rolex glinting under the lights. ""Simple math, sweetheart.""  
  
Ruby's mascara streaked as she choked down each burning shot, maintaining that beauty queen smile even as her eyes watered.  
  
When she spotted Kailen, her composure cracked. She stared down at her empty glass like it was suddenly the most fascinating thing in the room.  
  
""Well, if it isn't America's fastest man!"" someone called out. ""Ruby, why bother with Blake's pocket change? Your ex is worth what—half a billion now?""  
  
""I bet one night in Sinclair's bed would solve all your financial problems,"" another voice jeered.  
  
Kailen took a long drag of his cigarette, his expression bored, but I felt his muscles tense against me.  
  
""Keep talking and you'll be drinking through a straw tomorrow,"" he said flatly, resting his arm around my shoulders. ""And anyone who makes my wife uncomfortable can get the fuck out.""  
  
The crowd laughed nervously, calling me ""Mrs. Champion"" and commenting on how protective Kailen seemed.  
  
None of them knew he'd only shown up tonight after seeing Ruby's name on the RSVP list.  
  
Ruby glared at me, her knuckles white around her glass.  
  
Blake's hand slid down her back. ""Guess the racing superstar's moved on,"" he smirked. ""But I'm still buying what you're selling.""  
  
""Strip for me tonight, and I'll write you a check that'll keep those creditors away for a month. Small price for damaged goods, right?""  
  
The ash from Kailen's cigarette fell as his jaw clenched. To anyone else, he looked merely annoyed. But I recognized the cold fury building behind his eyes—the same look he got before a dangerous overtake on the track.  
  
Ruby looked up at Kailen, her gaze steady despite her tears. ""Not interested,"" she said, voice barely audible over the music.  
  
""I've only ever loved one man,"" she continued. ""Even if he's forgotten me, I won't let anyone else have what was his.""  
  
Kailen's fingers dug into my hand so hard I nearly gasped.  
  
Blake laughed, running his hand through his slicked-back hair. ""Playing hard to get with a foreclosure notice? That's fucking rich,"" he sneered. ""Tell yourself whatever fairy tale you want—you're coming home with me tonight, princess. Consider it charity work.""  
  
He grabbed Ruby's wrist, dragging her stumbling figure toward the exit. She tried pushing him away, but the alcohol had taken its toll.  
  
Kailen's eyes tracked her every movement. His breathing had changed—shallow and quick, like before a crash.  
  
Just before they reached the door, something in Kailen snapped.  
  
He moved with the same precision that had made him legendary on the track. Three strides, then his fist connected with Blake's jaw with a sickening crack.  
  
Blake hit the floor. Kailen was on him instantly, pinning him with a knee to the chest.  
  
""Touch her again and I'll break every fucking bone in your hands,"" he snarled, landing another punch. ""You'll never sign another check in your life.""  
  
People scrambled for their phones. I rushed over and grabbed Kailen's arm, feeling the tremors of rage running through him.  
  
""Kailen, stop—you're going to kill him,"" I whispered urgently.  
  
He turned to me, and in that moment, I was looking at a stranger. ""Back off,"" he said coldly. ""This isn't your business.""  
  
I froze, the wedding ring suddenly heavy on my finger.  
  
Ruby threw herself between them, her perfectly manicured nails clutching Kailen's bloodied knuckles. ""Please stop,"" she begged, tears flowing freely now. ""Your hands—your career—don't ruin everything because of me.""  
  
""I thought... I was so afraid you really didn't care anymore..."" Her voice broke, the strong facade crumbling completely.  
  
Kailen didn't hesitate. He wrapped his arms around her, shielding her from the crowd's stares and camera phones.  
  
Everyone watched in silence as America's racing legend walked out with the girl he'd never gotten over.  
  
I stood alone in a room full of people, holding my clutch purse and the shattered pieces of my marriage.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Kailen never came home that night.  
  
At 3 AM, Ruby posted on X: ""You said you'd never hold anyone else's hand again.""  
  
The photo showed interlaced fingers, with the unmistakable birthmark on the man's hand—Kailen's distinctive freckle that racing fans recognized from a thousand podium photos.  
  
And just like that, I became the ""anyone else"" whose hand he would no longer hold.  
  
Within ten minutes, #SinclairAffair was trending.  
  
Ruby's supporters flooded her comments: ""Get your man back, girl! You two were ALWAYS endgame! ?""  
  
""Screw loyalty—I'm Team Kailen Cheating if it means watching Vivia's fake ass get dumped lmaooo""  
  
People were grabbing popcorn, waiting for my public meltdown.  
  
A few loyal fans defended him: ""That's not Kailen's hand, right? u/KailenSinclair your wife has supported you through everything. Don't throw away what you have, man.""  
  
Our joint sponsorships were worth millions—Rolex, Tiffany, that stupid kitchen appliance campaign where we pretended to make breakfast together. The contract penalties alone would bankrupt most small countries.  
  
When our agent couldn't reach Kailen, she called me in a panic: ""Post something, anything! Make it look like you're together. We need damage control NOW.""  
  
I scrolled through my camera roll, realizing how few photos we actually had together. In the rare ones that existed, I was always the only one smiling.  
  
Finally, I posted an old picture of Kailen reading at home, bathed in warm lamplight. He looked just like Jayden in that moment—same profile, same furrowed brow of concentration that had made me fall for the wrong brother years ago.  
  
Comments immediately flooded in:  
  
""See? The champ's at HOME with his WIFE! Anyone saying otherwise can catch these hands! ?""  
  
Everyone started trashing Ruby, calling her an attention-seeking liar.  
  
Until Kailen himself retweeted Ruby's post five minutes later.  
  
Under that damning photo of their intertwined hands, he wrote simply: ""Yes, that's me.""  
  
Just like that, he publicly acknowledged their reunion while exposing my pathetic attempt at covering for him.  
  
Once again, he'd thrown me away for Ruby Miller.  
  
Her fans invaded my mentions: ""Caught in 4K trying to fake your marriage lmaooo get rekt Vivia ?""  
  
""Three years and you couldn't keep your man. Pathetic.""  
  
Who said I ever wanted Kailen's heart in the first place?  
  
I deleted every trace of him from my phone.  
  
Divorce papers suddenly seemed long overdue.

She was trying flip it over so eventually I helped her so we could go back to sleep but there ya go, a baby (kid?) centipede that escaped into my shoe pile and probably then to my pile of clothes next to it. I live in a tiny house so everything is next to each other. I searched through my shoes with my cat and moved the baskets to see if it was hiding but it was not. At this point it’s very likely in my chaos of clothes. 

I decided to do a spring cleaning and cleared everything in my house. I took the clothes in that pile outside and shook out each one of them and put them in trash bags to eventually take to wash, knowing that the centipede is probably there but also wishful thinking it left my house. I put them in my car (this was Friday 5/9) thinking everything will be fine, but also a little bit weary. 

Today (5/14) I’m driving to Lahaina for work and stop at a gas station and right under the lever on the floor to open the gas cap was a dead centipede about that size. For reference, I’m lazy and probably fill $20 of gas every two days so I am relatively active with the lever. I am probably on auto pilot when I do this because of how often I pull that lever. Today I pulled that lever twice in a ten minute period today and it was only the second time i realized the centipede was directly under it (and probably killed by squashing).

This is the important part: Eventually had my coworker get rid of it for me and it was super dry and super dead. She suggested it’s not my centipede from the house because of how long it was probably dead based on how dried out it was but then considered the timeline and heat of my car and thought it could be the centipede from my house. 

Here are my thoughts:

1. Obviously I didn’t find the centipede in the house and took the bags of clothing where  it was likely hiding into my car (I know I’m stupid)
2. Same size
3. Centipedes are pretty uncommon in my life, especially in my car. Only time my car had a problem was when I had the windows down and my battery died and I was too sick to care and that was cockroaches of course.
4. My car gets super super hot when parked and will even melt plastic coffee cups, could it have dried out that much since Friday? Please be generous and say yes.

Among the most popular options on the market are Zipfizz and Liquid IV. These two products have carved out strong followings by promising to deliver hydration, energy, and essential nutrients. Despite their similarities, they differ significantly in their formulation, intended purpose, ingredients, benefits, drawbacks, pricing, and customer satisfaction.

This in-depth article explores every angle of Zipfizz versus Liquid IV to help you determine which one might be the better fit for your lifestyle and health goals. Whether you are an athlete, a frequent traveler, a student burning the midnight oil, or just someone who wants a daily health boost, understanding the nuances of each product is crucial.

# Overview of Zipfizz

Zipfizz is a powdered energy drink mix that comes in a small tube. Its primary selling points are energy enhancement and multivitamin supplementation. Unlike many sugary energy drinks, Zipfizz promotes itself as a healthy alternative that includes a broad range of vitamins and electrolytes with low sugar and a modest dose of caffeine.

Founded in 2003, Zipfizz quickly gained attention for its portability and emphasis on health-conscious energy. It is sold in over 25 flavors including fruit punch, orange soda, grape, and black cherry.

Each tube is designed to be mixed with 16 to 20 ounces of water and delivers a sparkling, slightly fizzy beverage.

# Overview of Liquid IV

Liquid IV, on the other hand, is known for its patented Cellular Transport Technology (CTT), which is designed to deliver hydration to the bloodstream faster and more efficiently than plain water. While it also comes as a powder in single-serving sticks, Liquid IV primarily targets hydration rather than energy, although it offers specific products for energy and sleep.

Founded in 2012 and later acquired by Unilever in 2020, Liquid IV has grown rapidly in popularity thanks to its clean branding, high-profile endorsements, and focus on functional hydration. It is commonly available in flavors like lemon lime, passion fruit, acai berry, and strawberry.

# Ingredients Comparison

**Zipfizz Ingredients**

Zipfizz is heavily loaded with vitamins and minerals. Each tube typically includes:

* 100 mg of caffeine from green tea and guarana
* 500 mg of vitamin C
* 41,667% of the daily value for vitamin B12
* Electrolytes: potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium
* Antioxidants like alpha-lipoic acid and grape seed extract
* Amino acids such as taurine and arginine
* Sucralose and xylitol for sweetness

Its caffeine content is similar to a cup of coffee, making it suitable as a morning or mid-afternoon energy booster.

**Liquid IV Ingredients**

Liquid IV’s flagship product, the Hydration Multiplier, includes:

* A precise electrolyte blend: 370 mg of sodium, 250 mg of potassium
* Vitamins B3, B5, B6, B12, and C
* Pure cane sugar and dextrose
* No caffeine in the standard hydration product
* Non-GMO ingredients
* No artificial sweeteners

Some Liquid IV variants include additional features, such as the Energy Multiplier, which has matcha and 100 mg of caffeine, or the Sleep Multiplier, which contains melatonin and valerian root.

# Function and Purpose

**Zipfizz Purpose**

Zipfizz functions primarily as a daily energy booster and multivitamin. Its key benefits include:

* Natural energy without a sugar crash
* A huge boost of vitamin B12 to support mental clarity and focus
* Full-spectrum multivitamin coverage
* Immune system support
* Hydration support with electrolytes

Zipfizz is ideal for people who want a replacement for energy drinks and coffee or who want to supplement their daily vitamin intake with a convenient beverage.

**Liquid IV Purpose**

Liquid IV’s central goal is hydration. Its benefits include:

* Rapid rehydration using Cellular Transport Technology
* Electrolyte replenishment for athletes or people in hot climates
* Support for energy and sleep with specialized blends
* Enhanced absorption of water and nutrients

It is often marketed as a way to recover from travel, workouts, hangovers, or illness.

# Nutritional Profile and Health Considerations

**Zipfizz Nutritional Profile**

Zipfizz is rich in vitamins, with a strong emphasis on the B-complex family. Here’s what you get in one serving:

* Calories: 20
* Carbohydrates: 2 grams
* Sugars: 0 grams
* Sodium: 75 mg
* Potassium: 950 mg
* Caffeine: 100 mg

Zipfizz is low in calories and sugar, making it keto-friendly and suitable for diabetics. However, its extremely high B12 content may be a concern for those sensitive to supplements.

**Liquid IV Nutritional Profile**

One stick of Hydration Multiplier contains:

* Calories: 45
* Carbohydrates: 11 grams
* Sugars: 11 grams (from cane sugar and dextrose)
* Sodium: 500 mg
* Potassium: 370 mg

While higher in sugar and calories than Zipfizz, this is a tradeoff intended to enhance hydration absorption through the glucose-sodium transport system.

# Taste and Flavor Experience

**Zipfizz Taste**

Zipfizz is carbonated and has a fizzy texture when mixed with water. Most flavors are fruit-based with a slightly tangy and sweet taste, though some may find the artificial sweeteners noticeable.

Popular flavors include:

* Black cherry
* Pink lemonade
* Orange soda
* Grape

Taste reviews are mixed, with some users loving the fizzy kick and others preferring a more natural flavor.

**Liquid IV Taste**

Liquid IV has a smoother, non-carbonated taste with a strong citrus base. The sweetness from cane sugar and dextrose makes it pleasant and refreshing to many.

Top flavors include:

* Lemon lime
* Strawberry
* Acai berry
* Watermelon

Most users find the flavor highly palatable, though a few may find it too sweet or salty depending on their preferences.

# Cost and Value

**Zipfizz Pricing**

Zipfizz is typically sold in 20-count tubes for around $27 to $30, averaging about $1.35 to $1.50 per serving. Bulk packs and online discounts can lower the cost further.

Given the amount of vitamins and energy ingredients, many users consider Zipfizz a good value, especially when used in place of multivitamins or energy drinks.

**Liquid IV Pricing**

Liquid IV is slightly more expensive per serving. A 16-count box costs between $22 and $25, or about $1.40 to $1.60 per stick.

While pricier, the unique Cellular Transport Technology and hydration focus justify the cost for many buyers, especially athletes or travelers.

# Benefits and Drawbacks

**Zipfizz Pros**

* High in vitamins and antioxidants
* Moderate caffeine for energy
* Low in sugar and carbs
* Portable and easy to use

* Very high B12 may be excessive for some

# Customer Reviews and Feedback

**Zipfizz Customer Sentiment**

Reviews on platforms like Amazon and Walmart are generally positive. Customers praise its energy-boosting effects and how it replaces multiple supplements in one drink. However, a few complain about the taste and gastrointestinal discomfort from certain ingredients.

**Liquid IV Customer Sentiment**

Liquid IV enjoys high ratings across multiple eCommerce platforms. Many users report feeling more hydrated quickly and enjoy the convenience of having an oral rehydration solution without needing medical products. Complaints usually center around the sweetness or sugar content.

# Scientific Support and Clinical Evidence

**Zipfizz Scientific Basis**

The use of B12, caffeine, and antioxidants in Zipfizz is well supported by nutritional science. Caffeine boosts alertness and performance while vitamins like B12 and C support metabolic functions and immunity. However, there are no clinical trials directly validating Zipfizz’s product claims.

**Liquid IV Scientific Basis**

Liquid IV’s formula is modeled after WHO-approved Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) standards. Its Cellular Transport Technology combines sodium, glucose, and potassium to optimize water absorption at the cellular level, backed by solid hydration science. While the product itself may not be independently studied, its foundation is credible.

# Environmental and Ethical Considerations

Both Zipfizz and Liquid IV offer recyclable packaging. Liquid IV takes it a step further with its sustainability initiatives. The company donates millions of servings to disaster-struck or underserved communities and aims to be climate neutral.

Zipfizz does not publicize any major corporate social responsibility initiatives but does maintain a minimalistic package design that reduces waste.

# Final Verdict: Which One Wins

Choosing between Zipfizz and Liquid IV depends heavily on your primary needs.

If your focus is energy, mental clarity, or vitamin supplementation, Zipfizz is a clear winner. Its caffeine content and vitamin-rich profile make it a powerful daily performance enhancer. It suits people looking for a coffee alternative or who want to skip traditional multivitamins.

On the other hand, if your goal is to rehydrate efficiently, especially after sweating, travel, illness, or alcohol, Liquid IV delivers outstanding results. Its scientific hydration foundation makes it more than just flavored water and sets it apart from other electrolyte powders.

# Conclusion

Both Zipfizz and Liquid IV offer legitimate benefits and have carved out niches for good reason. Zipfizz is the go-to product for people needing energy, vitamins, and mental clarity. Liquid IV stands out for those prioritizing hydration and clean ingredients.

When choosing between them, consider your health goals, flavor preferences, sensitivity to caffeine or sugar, and overall lifestyle. You may even find that keeping both in your pantry is the smartest move, using Zipfizz when you need a pick-me-up and Liquid IV when you need to bounce back from dehydration.When it comes to staying hydrated and maintaining peak energy levels, more people are turning to powdered drink mixes as a convenient solution.

Chapter 1  
  
I'm a minion to Vivienne—the Upper East Side princess. Ever since we were kids, she'd always dump the stuff she didn't like on me.  
  
""Ugh, I hate this flavor of cake. You eat it for me.""  
  
""This dress is so not my vibe. It's yours now.""  
  
One day, she dragged me to stake out some corporate headquarters, where she discreetly pointed out a drop-dead gorgeous CEO. 'That's him—the guy my parents want me to marry,' she whispered.  
  
I was speechless. I'd never seen anyone that hot before, and just as I was about to congratulate her.  
  
She frowned, grabbed my hand and said: ""I don't like this guy. Why don't you marry him instead of me?""  
  
\---  
  
Before I could even process what was happening, Vivienne shoved me forward.  
  
I stumbled right into the arms of the man who was just walking out. Papers scattered everywhere.  
  
A strong hand gripped my shoulder, saving me from face-planting. When I looked up and saw his ridiculously perfect face, my heart literally skipped a beat.  
  
He was hands-down the hottest man I'd ever seen in my life.  
  
While I was still in a daze, Vivienne stepped out from behind a column, hands on her hips, and announced: ""Knox, I can't marry you.""  
  
Knox's perfect brows furrowed slightly as his ice-cold gaze shifted to me.  
  
Vivienne gave me a little push, clearing her throat nervously. ""Because she's into you. So I figured I'd play cupid. Am I right, Piper?""  
  
She shot me that look—the same one I'd seen a thousand times before.  
  
So I forced myself to play along. ""Yeah.""  
  
The moment I said it, Knox's hands clenched at his sides, and something flickered in his eyes.  
  
""Into me?""  
  
Vivienne jumped in: ""Yeah. I mean, I don't like you, but Piper does. She's practically family to the Sullivans anyway. Why don't you just marry her instead?""  
  
Knox's assistant started freaking out. ""Are you serious? Come on, Miss Sullivan. Stop playing games.""  
  
""How many women have you already tried to throw at Mr. Chase to get out of this arranged marriage? Now you're even dragging your friend into this mess? Your father would lose it if he knew what you're doing.""  
  
Vivienne shot the assistant a death glare.  
  
Weirdly enough, while they were arguing about the Sullivan-Chase merger marriage right outside the company, Knox himself seemed totally unbothered—not stopping them, not weighing in.  
  
When Vivienne couldn't win against the assistant, she turned on me.  
  
""Piper, say something!"" she snapped.  
  
I just stood there completely lost for words.  
  
""If I remember correctly,"" Knox cut in casually, ""your father should be free today. Perfect timing to discuss our marriage arrangement.""  
  
Vivienne froze, then did a complete 180. ""I'm out of here. Don't tell my dad I was here!""  
  
And just like that, she bolted from the ""crime scene"".  
  
She took off so fast that I didn't know whether to follow her or stay put.  
  
""Let me take you home,"" Knox said to me, then ready to turn to give instructions to his assistant.  
  
I waved my hands frantically. ""No, no! I can just Uber. Seriously.""  
  
I nervously glanced behind Knox where about a dozen suits were clutching their files, all looking completely lost as they waited for their CEO's next move.  
  
Knox's lips curved into a slight smile. ""Let me take you home. You're Vivienne's friend, after all.""  
  
With that, a sleek black Maserati pulled up to the entrance of the company.  
  
The driver opened the door, and Knox gestured for me to get in first.  
  
As I slid into the seat, I was like, wow, Vivienne's seriously the real deal - the Upper East Side's ultimate It Girl. And here I am, just her wingwoman, getting treated like royalty.  
  
What I didn't expect was that when Knox said ""Let me take you home,"" he really meant himself.  
  
In the backseat, this walking Greek god was sitting right next to me, and my nerves were going absolutely haywire.  
  
""Heading to the Sullivan estate?"" he asked.  
  
I nodded.  
  
The car moved smoothly through traffic, tree shadows dancing across the windows.  
  
The silence in the car was so awkward I was mentally calculating how much skin damage I'd get if I rolled out at 40 mph.  
  
I stared down at my phone, pretending to be super busy while actually Googling Knox Chase.  
  
Self-made billionaire. CEO of Chase Industries. Youngest Fortune 500 exec in history...  
  
The man had countless titles.  
  
So why on earth would appearance-obsessed Vivienne be against marrying this catch?  
  
Wait, was he... Couldn't get it up?  
  
What a waste of that face if so.  
  
I shook my head, thinking about the tragic waste of genetic material. Suddenly, Knox opened his eyes and caught me staring, with this amused little look on his face.  
  
""You and Vivienne tight?"" he asked, probably trying to get some intel on his future wife.  
  
""Known her forever. I'm pretty much her human diary at this point. Feel free to ask whatever.""  
  
Knox paused. ""Do you usually wear her clothes?""  
  
I nodded. ""Yeah, whatever she gets tired of ends up with me.""  
  
Actually, this outfit I'm wearing now? She wore it to Coachella once. Said she couldn't be caught dead in it twice, so it became mine.  
  
""This is one of those hand-me-downs. Fits pretty well, right?""  
  
As I lifted my arm, the too-loose sleeve that I'd bunched at my wrist slid down. I casually tugged it back up.  
  
""Yeah, it looks good on you,"" he said.  
  
No judgment or disgust crossed his face. Instead, he said:  
  
""I used to wear other's clothes all the time too.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Soon, the car reached the Sullivan estate.  
  
The moment the door was opened, I bolted out like my ass was on fire.  
  
""Thanks for the ride, Mr. Chase!""  
  
Inside the house, Mr. Sullivan was fuming:  
  
""Vivienne, what the hell were you thinking? Having Piper take your place in this marriage? How do you think the Chases will react to this stunt?""  
  
""I don't care. I'm not marrying him! I don't like Knox!"" Vivienne shouted back.  
  
""Please. Someone who made CEO that young? His mind games would eat me alive.""  
  
""Dad, don't you love me anymore?!""  
  
...  
  
When I walked into the living room, Vivienne's temper tantrum just stopped cold, looking confused:  
  
""Why'd you take so long to get back?""  
  
""It's just a quick twenty-minute trip from the Chase Industries to here. How'd you manage to take this long? Did you, like, get lost or something?""  
  
Just then, the butler rushed in: ""Sir, Mr. Chase is here. He's waiting at the entrance.""  
  
""Knox? What's he doing here?"" Mr. Sullivan's brow furrowed.  
  
The butler glanced at me: ""Perhaps Miss Piper Clark can explain. They arrived together.""  
  
""What?!"" Vivienne looked both shocked and delighted. ""Piper, did Knox personally drive you home?""  
  
""When I've sent girls to throw themselves at him before, they couldn't even get past security, let alone have him drive them home.""  
  
Vivienne's tone was ridiculously dramatic.  
  
I bit my lip. ""Maybe he was... just heading this way anyway?""  
  
""Anyway. If the Sullivans absolutely needs to marry someone off to Knox, why not Piper? Just make her your goddaughter officially and problem solved! She's grown up with me, knows everything I know, and is actually more responsible and smarter than me. Sure, she's not quite as hot as me, but she's still a total catch. Why can't she marry Knox?""  
  
Vivienne had thrown these tantrums many times before, even threatening to run away to force her dad.  
  
Mr. Sullivan sighed heavily: ""Piper, if you were asked to marry Knox, would you be willing?""  
  
I pictured that face that looked like it had been carved by angels, and nodded without thinking: ""Yes.""  
  
Mr. Sullivan looked surprised: ""You like Knox?""  
  
""I've only met him once. Can't really say I like him.""  
  
But it was just like all those expensive things Vivienne had pushed on me over the years—  
  
I didn't always love everything, but I knew they were valuable, luxurious things I could never afford on my own.  
  
The things Vivienne turned up her nose at were things I had no right to be picky about—  
  
Like the study guides she didn't want to use? I'd been dying to buy them but couldn't afford them.  
  
Like the designer necklaces she'd toss in the trash? I'd secretly rescue and fix them to wear myself.  
  
Like the shoes that hurt her feet? I'd grab them saying they fit me fine.  
  
Even more, someone like Knox Chase? He was gorgeous, whose face was something extraordinary. I was drawn to his face the moment I saw him.  
  
I lowered my head and said quietly: ""If Vivienne doesn't want to marry him, I'm willing to take her place.""  
  
Vivienne and I have known each other since middle school.  
  
Back then, I used to hang around this fancy private school where all the rich kids went. A bunch of us foster kids would go there because students were always tossing out barely-worn uniforms or barely-used notebooks. And we would pick them all back.  
  
That day, after my classes ended, I was staking out my usual spot when I saw Vivienne walking out and throwing a diamond-encrusted watch into the trash can. The moment she left, I darted over to grab it.  
  
What I didn't expect was for her to come back. We locked eyes while I was standing there with her watch already on my wrist.  
  
I quickly took it off, wiped it clean, and tried to hand it back.  
  
She wrinkled her nose. ""Keep it. I'm over it anyway.""  
  
I mumbled a thanks and slipped it back on.  
  
""You go to East Side Public?"" she asked, eyeing my uniform.  
  
""Yeah.""  
  
Vivienne thought for a second. ""Every Wednesday after school, I clean out stuff I don't want anymore—clothes and whatever. You should swing by.""  
  
After that, I'd show up a little early each Wednesday. Vivienne would hand off her expensive clothes and jewelry to me. Sometimes she'd give me fancy cupcakes she was too full to finish, or accessories she'd decided weren't her vibe.  
  
One day, I waited forever, but she didn't show. The school had almost emptied out.  
  
Getting worried, I snuck onto campus and found her crying behind the main building. She'd taken a bad fall—her knee was all scraped up, and her phone was shattered so she couldn't call home.  
  
I crouched down in front of her. ""I'll carry you.""  
  
Tears rolled down her face. ""You're so skinny. Can you even lift me?""  
  
""Trust me, I've carried heavier.""  
  
After I got her to the nurse's office, I was about to leave when Vivienne asked, ""I heard you're a foster kid. Would you want to come live with me?""  
  
From that day on, I moved into the Sullivan mansion as Vivienne's companion and study buddy. She told her dad she was lonely, so Mr. Sullivan arranged for me to transfer to her private school.  
  
Even though Vivienne only gave me things she didn't really want, I knew she was thoughtful about it. She'd always sort through her stuff, picking out the newer, prettier items for me.  
  
Vivienne might seem spoiled and bratty on the surface, but she's actually really kind and soft-hearted.  
  
So if she's really against this arranged marriage, me taking her place isn't such a big deal.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
After I nodded my approval, Mr. Sullivan went to invite him inside.  
  
Knox sat at the head of the table with that effortless elegance only old money can buy, casually pushing away the steaming cup of tea with his long, perfectly manicured fingers.  
  
Mr. Sullivan was practically dragging Vivienne over to apologize to Knox.  
  
""We owe you an apology for this whole situation,"" Mr. Sullivan said, looking deeply uncomfortable.  
  
Knox didn't seem upset at all. ""It's simple, really. The Sullivans can publicly announce the engagement is off, right?""  
  
""Well—""  
  
Mr. Sullivan hesitated.  
  
Of course.  
  
Canceling the engagement would hit the Sullivans hard. Knox didn't necessarily need a strategic marriage to secure the Chases' position, but the Sullivans absolutely did.  
  
""Actually, Piper is practically our daughter too,"" Mr. Sullivan pivoted. ""She's been living with us since she was young. We've considered her our adopted daughter for years—we just never made it official.""  
  
Knox raised an eyebrow at me, then spoke deliberately: ""If Piper truly is your daughter, then she should receive the same treatment as Vivienne.""  
  
With just that one sentence, Mr. Sullivan transferred into my account the same allowance Vivienne had been getting all these years.  
  
As I slid into Knox's car, I was still staring at all those zeros in my bank account.  
  
I'd never seen that much money before.  
  
Never in my life.  
  
After the engagement announcement hit the press, I moved into Knox's place.  
  
The second I walked through the door, I froze in shock.  
  
I'd expected the Chase mansion to be even more over-the-top than the Sullivans'. The Sullivan house had at least seven or eight people living there, including the butler and housekeeper.  
  
But Knox? He lived completely alone. No live-in butler. No driver.  
  
It's eerily quiet.  
  
Knox handed me a pair of fluffy bunny slippers.  
  
""If you need anything, just let me know. Mrs. Wilson lives nearby—I'll have her swing by whenever I'm not around.""  
  
He gave me the quickie tour, showing me my room and where all the essential stuff was kept.  
  
After my shower, I still felt jumpy. I knew practically nothing about Knox. Had I lost my mind, agreeing to move in with this guy so fast?  
  
Mid-panic, someone knocked on my door.  
  
At this hour, it could only be Knox.  
  
""Door's open,"" I called out.  
  
I threw on a cardigan and stood by the door, my hands clammy with nerves.  
  
Knox pushed the door open, holding a mug of steaming milk.  
  
""Thought you might want this before bed. Sorry for the rush job—tomorrow Mrs. Wilson will take you shopping for whatever personal stuff you need.""  
  
I finally took a breath. ""Thanks.""  
  
He'd actually been super thoughtful.  
  
As he turned to leave, Knox suddenly stopped and let out a soft laugh.  
  
""No need to look at me like I'm a threat. I won't force you into anything you're not into.""  
  
My ears burned bright red.  
  
I got up early the next morning to find Knox in the kitchen wearing an apron, actually making breakfast.  
  
""You down for a sandwich?"" he asked.  
  
I nodded, then remembered he was literally a CEO of a massive company. Having him cook for me felt weird as hell.  
  
""Maybe I should—""  
  
Knox struggled to flip a sunny-side-up egg without breaking the yolk.  
  
""Nah, I got this. Go brush your teeth or whatever. Food's almost ready.""  
  
By the time I finished in the bathroom, Knox was still battling it out in the kitchen. I'd heard plates shattering at least three times already.  
  
I glanced around, wondering what I could do to help. Just as I was figuring out the coffee machine, the doorbell rang.  
  
I set down my mug and went to answer it.  
  
""Knox—wait, what? Did I get the wrong place?""  
  
The guy at the door double-checked the house number, then gave me a suspicious once-over.  
  
""Knox is in the kitchen. I'll go get him for you.""  
  
I darted back inside with the visitor right on my heels.  
  
""Piper, can you help me with this?"" Knox had his back to me, spatula in hand, struggling with the apron ties.  
  
My fingers accidentally brushed against his lean, muscular waist.  
  
Knox let out a soft groan.  
  
My cheeks instantly caught fire.  
  
""So I heard you called in sick today. I was like, no way the workaholic who hasn't taken a day off in years is actually skipping work. Had to see it for myself. Now I get why you didn't show up this morning—rough night?"" The visitor pushed open the kitchen door, catching me red-handed untying Knox's apron.  
  
""Why are both your faces so red? What were you two doing?""  
  
Knox grabbed the apron and tossed it at the guy's face. ""Blake, don't you have anything better to do?""  
  
""Hold up, you're actually eating breakfast? Is the world ending?""  
  
Blake grinned. ""Aren't you going to introduce me to this gorgeous woman?""  
  
Knox walked past with two plates of sandwiches, casually dropping: ""Piper Clark.""  
  
Blake's expression froze, his voice suddenly way too loud:  
  
""What??! Did you just say PIPER CLARK?!""

So setup:
- profitec go with dimmer mod
- DF64v w. SSP HU (and MP currently not in) @1500rpm
- Weber Unibasket 
- water temp 95C
- dose 20g
- yield 50g

Well basically I think that this light is too light for espresso. 
I’m already experienced with tricky roasts and I’ve had plenty of geisha, so I know what to expect and how to tune the dialing in, but this one really doesn’t work.

I’m grinding extra fine (for ref, at grind size 5 when I grind a medium roast at 20), I’m starting with slow infusion with the dimmer mod but overall nothing works. The cup is horrible, hollow, unexpressive and more reminiscent of dust in water rather than coffee. 

Afterwards I tried to do an aeropress out of it with a slightly longer steep time, and I’d say the results are more interesting. Overall sweeter and more complete. I’ve to try to dial that better in. I’m not a filter person, but I guess I’ll have to have it as filter for not wasting it.

In the last picture you see the roast difference between these beans and an Italian dark roast, just for reference.

1kn1i3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingApps/comments/1kn1i3h/15_biggest_mistakes_guys_make_on_dating_apps/,15 Biggest Mistakes Guys Make on Dating Apps,"**1.    Getting sexual early** \- Let’s face it, as blokes we are always tempted in some way to do this; especially if you’re on a rough dry streak. The fact is it’s not going to do you any favours. Chances are this is going to seal your fate in the unread or unmatched column. Take a deep breath. Have a flog if you really have to, and take the time to establish common ground and get to know the girl first before you start tilting the conversation in a sexual direction.

**2.    Boring chit chat** \- Nowadays people are more distracted than ever before on their phones; females included. This means that you have to be memorable. The best way to do this is with your chat. Do away with mundane questions like “How was your day?”  or shallow compliments like “You’re so hot”. Instead, try and relate the conversation to their photos or something they mentioned in their bio. Show genuine curiosity in them and their passions and you will almost certainly get the conversation going.

**3.    Waiting too long to ask them out** \- Now that the conversation is going, the mission should be to try and angle for a date as quickly as possible. No one needs another pen pal. It’s time to get face to face and see whether there’s connection or if you are wasting your time. If you’ve successfully avoided the boring chit chat, you need to be asking the girl out within the first 5 messages you have sent. You may think that is forward, but give it a crack. A lot of girls like blokes that take initiative. I reckon you’ll be surprised with the results.

**4.    Too wide a radius** \- This might seem obvious but so many guys don’t even think about this. Don’t waste your time and your matches on girls that are 50, 100 or 1000km away. Ignore this rule if you actually do want a pen pal, because chances are you’re never going to meet up. I would generally recommend setting your radius to 14km away. Anymore and you are likely wasting your time if you want something that lasts.

**5.    Photos of yourself with fish** \- While I'm fucking awful at fishing, I do enjoy it. However, it's essential to consider the number of attractive ladies are genuinely into fishing. I’d go for one fish photo maximum. Honestly, it might be better to ditch the fish altogether and opt for a picture on the side of the boat. Let’s be real, girls dig blokes with (or on) boats. Chances are they don’t give a shit about your world beating barra you caught in Cape York last year. So, where possible, just ditch the fish photos.

**6.    Too many photos with friends** \- While photos with the lads are great and show that you aren’t a total loner, an excess can be confusing for potential matches. We all know the feeling of getting a match where you are hoping, praying that it’s the stunning friend only to find out you’ve matched with the female equivalent of Mike Wazowksi. My golden rule here is that **at least** your first photo should always be you by yourself without sunnies. Your next one can be with one mate, and then go hard on whatever photos from there.

**7.    Replying too early** \- I actually hate to write about this one because it is one of these dumb, unspoken social conventions of the technology era in which we live but there is truth to it. Replying too early makes you seem overeager and creepily keen. I’d say this mainly applies in the first four or five messages you send, but it is definitely something to avoid. On Bumble for instance, I used to wait an hour to go back to a girl that has messaged first. The annoying thing is there is no hard and fast rule and it depends a bit on the conversation, just **never go straight back.**

**8.    Tragic bio** \- Your bio is your chance to show to potential matches a bit about your personality but most importantly your sense of humour. What I would tend to avoid is things like your political preferences, complaints in general, your favourite sports teams (they don’t give a fuck) and red flags. Instead, try to think of something that stands out from the crowd. Funny and thought-provoking questions can be a safe bet. Or refer to possible date ideas to show that you’re serious.

**9.    Too few photos** \-This is pretty damn simple. Just have enough photos so that they can see who you are. I would suggest four photos is the minimum. Avoid too many photos with sunglasses and hats on because girls love to see a guy’s eyes. If you have too few photos then they will get the impression that you are hiding something. Include photos that show different facets of your life as a way of expressing your personality. As they say, a photo speaks a thousand words.

**10.  Ask meaningful questions** \- I hinted at this before but we need to do away with the boring “How are you?” and “How was your day” sort of questions. These simply don’t stand out. They will get ignored and show that you’re uninterested in them. Instead, ask them questions about their photos or their biography. If they have a photo at Machu Picchu then ask them about their South America trip. Tell them you’ve always wanted to go. Show a genuine interest and you will get the conversation flowing in no time.

**11.  Unoriginal opening line** \- You are doing yourself absolutely no favours by starting off with a simple “Hey.” I would suggest trying to start the conversation off with something that is humorous or a question that is based on their profile like I mentioned just before. The first message is make or break. If you throw some weak ass shit out there, chances are it’s going to fizzle out. The key is to make it seem natural. Always ask a question though, you need to give them an opening to come back with a response.

**12.  Dating preferences not set properly** \- If you’re going for a one-night stand, then simply do not waste your time on the girls that are looking for a relationship. It’s a waste of everyone’s time and a huge mistake. The only outcome from this is going to be you getting rejected or ignored. Save your time. If a girl has the what they’re looking for preference set to “Not sure yet.”, I would take that as a green light for whatever you’re chasing. 

**13.  Not taking communication off the App** \- Some girls get embarrassed about having push notifications for their dating apps turned on. That’s why it’s important to try and get their mobile number. Not only does that change their perception of you from ‘guy from Tinder’ into a contact in their phone, it will mean you will always pop-up on their lock screen! But, avoid the next rule like the plague.

**14.  Asking for their Snapchat** \- This is just a huge no. If you are serious about dating apps then there are few worse moves than asking girls for their Snap. They will read between the lines and know that you are looking for nudes or just want to send out a seedy pic.

**15.  Rubbish date ideas** \- Let’s say you’ve avoided the mistakes and it’s time to organise a date, now don’t fumble the bag. This is so simple but so easy to get wrong. Don’t jump the gun and invite a girl over before you’ve ever met. They will literally think you are a rapist. Ask them to go for a drink – whether it’s a coffee or an alcoholic beverage it doesn’t matter. Women love conversations that take place on either side of two beverages, hot or cold.",2,1747290859.0,DatingApps,0,0.75,False

That said…

My system has never done a full emergency shutdown before. I noticed some lag while dealing with 5 pallets of loose cash in CCS, and about halfway through sorting them, the whole thing just powered off. After rebooting, I monitored temps while running a few other games (RDR2, Assassin’s Creed, Cities: Skylines II) no issues at all.

But as soon as I loaded CCS again, my CPU shot into the 80s instantly and climbed to 100°C within minutes. GPU stayed fine in the mid-60s, but the CPU was cooking.

I’ll revisit it after the upgrade and a proper clean, but just wanted to share this in case anyone else is seeing the same thing. For now, I won’t be loading that save again.

# By chance,I discovered that Ken Dixon had hidden a wedding ring at home.I thought,after seven years of secretly dating,he was finally going to propose to me.

Yet,even though I had been waiting for a long time,only to find that he brought the ring box to the company party

I watched with my own eyes as he got down on one knee and proposed to the intern,Hazel Easton,in front of everyone at work.

Hazel slipped on the ring,kissed Ken passionately and excitedly said,“I do!”

Overwhelmed with joy,she ran over to celebrate with everyone with a glass of wine in her hand.However,she tripped and the wine splashed everywhere.

Instinctively,I shielded the bag in my hands. In doing so,I accidentally stepped into a gap and knocked over a table full of red wine bottles.

Ken's face changed in an instant.He scolded me harshly,""Assistant White,why are you always so clumsy?You ruined a whole table full of wine!”

It escaped his mind how much I cherish this bag,simply because this was the first gift he gave me when we first fell in love.

After he finished lashing out at me,he wrapped his arm around Hazel to comfort her.I rushed into the restroom and dialed home.

“Mom,I’ve changed my mind.I’ll agree to the arranged marriage you mentioned.”

——

There was a stunned pause on the other end of the call,then came the excitement,“Well….I thought I’d never see the day!Sweetheart,I’ll start making arrangements right away!""

I chuckled with a hint of self-mockery.

My mother always thought I had never been in a relationship before,but that actually was not true.

Ken and I had been together for seven years.He never wanted to announce our relationship publicly.He claimed the company had a strict no-dating policy for internal staff.

I had never told my mother about this because I did not want her to be worried or upset.

However,since he was about to marry another,there was no need to say anything.

“When are you coming home?I’ll arrange the meeting,”Mom asked.

“Soon,”I replied softly.

I hung up and opened the restroom door,only to see Ken standing at the door.

He looked gentle,even remorseful,as he reached for my hand.

“Baby,did you hurt yourself just now?Everyone from the company had come,so I had to act cold.About the proposal...I’ll explain everything once we’re home,okay?”

Explain?How could he possibly explain this?He had already proposed and put the ring on someone else's finger?Was there anything to explain?

I raised my head to look at him detachedly,""I understand.""

""…Honey,""he said with a cajoling tone,but his brows furrowed a little.

However,before he managed to say anything else,a colleague walked out of the party room.Instantly,his expression changed.He dropped my hand and slipped back into his usual cold,distant demeanor.

Then he said,""Emily White,remember your place.You’re my assistant,the company’s general assistant.Don’t embarrass me.”

My heart turned extremely cold.I lowered my eyes and replied quietly,“I understand.”

Ken turned around and walked into the restroom,without sparing a single glance at me.

My colleague went toward me and consoled me quietly,""Assistant White,don’t take it to [heart.It](http://heart.It) might be that the boss was in distress because you interrupted his perfect,joyous occasion.""

My smile stiffened.

What did she mean by""a perfect joyous occasion?""

Ken never told anyone at the company that we were in a relationship.Even when we traveled abroad for business and stayed at the same hotel,I would leave half an hour earlier and he would come a little later.We always took a different route.

In fact,the company’s most gossipy receptionist never picked up on anything unusual between me and Ken in all seven years.

For seven years,he had played his role so well and I played mine perfectly.

Just once in a while,I would quietly ask him when he was hugging me late at night,""When are we going to go public?I want to be the boss's wife openly.”

He would always give me a peck and reasoned,""Just wait a bit longer.The company's general mood is in a sensitive period.I'm afraid I'll be giving out a bad influence.""

That‘just wait a bit longer’turned into seven long years.People said the seven-year itch was real and I would not wait any longer.



Chapter 2

I chose not to stay and drink,so I left the party early and went home.

As the night deepened,my phone finally rang.

""Why did you leave without saying anything to me?""asked Ken in a disapproving way.

I answered calmly,“I went home.”

“A few young ladies from work got drunk.I’m dropping them off at their hotel.I’ll go there and be with you after that,okay?”

Huh!Is it a few young ladies,or just your new fiancée?

Although the question had already been on my lips,I did not say it out loud.I did not want to humiliate myself.

Just then,I heard a soft,female voice from the other end of the phone.“Boss,I can walk on my own…”

Then the call abruptly ended.However,I could still hear him clearly while persuading her with a low voice.""Don't make a fuss.I'll carry you.""

I held my phone tightly.I felt as if someone had suddenly poured a bucket of ice water over me.

I remembered years ago,on a business trip,I had gotten drunk.I playfully said I could not walk and hoped he would carry me.However,he scolded me in a low voice,""Stop acting out.What if someone sees us?”

Then he dragged me into the corner of the elevator and left immediately.

On the contrary,with Hazel,he was willing to carry her on his back in front of everyone,regardless of the repercussions.

Of course.They’re an official,legitimate couple now.There was no longer any need for secrecy,as Ken had in the past.

Despite being heartbroken,I started packing my stuff.Only then did I realize something.The house I had shared with Ken for seven years had a neat layout and minimal [furnishings.It](http://furnishings.It) was more like an exquisite showroom.There no warmth nor traces of a couple living together.There was also not a single photo of us together.

This was because Ken kept saying,“Let’s keep the house as simple and clean as possible.I sometimes have video meetings at home and I don’t want anyone to notice anything.”

At that time,I believed him.Noticing how meticulous and cautious he was,I even thought it was a sign of how responsible he was about his career.

Now,I realized that he was not cautious around outsiders.He was only careful around me.

At half past five in the morning,I had just fallen asleep when the door burst open with a loud bang.Ken had finally come back.

The man reeked of alcohol and a strong smell of perfume.A faint lipstick mark was still on his face.

As soon as he stepped into the room,he took off his coat and reached out to hug me.Then his eyes fell on the pile of old belongings scattered across the floor and he frowned.

Then he said,""Baby,are you mad because I proposed to Hazel tonight?She’s the daughter of the Easton Group’s chairman.I’m planning to use that connection here to secure a deal with the Easton Family.”

“You know how long we’ve been trying to land the investment from the Easton Group,right?It took me ages to figure out Hazel’s connection to them.Just bear with it for now.Once I get the investment,I’ll cut ties with her.”



Chapter 3

My gaze that landed on Ken was filled with disappointment.If this had been back when we first started dating,I might have actually believed his words.However,now,after waiting for him for seven years,all I knew was when Ken said""bear with it"".What he meant was that it would probably be many more years.

I was truly exhausted.I could not keep doing this anymore.I had wasted seven years of my youth,I might as well treat it as I fed my love to a black hole.

When he saw that I did not pay him any attention,Ken did not care.He turned around to get a drink,but his foot stepped on something.

Crack!

My head snapped up.I saw the broken string of beads on the floor crushed beneath his foot.

It was the bracelet I had handwoven for him during our first Valentine’s Day together.While packing last night,I couldn’t bear to throw it away,so I left it on the floor to take with me.

He glanced down at it and,with a frown full of disdain,as if he had just seen something filthy.He said,“What’s this?Don’t just toss garbage on the floor.”

My heart hurt so [much.It](http://much.It) felt as if our seven years together were crushed by his kick.

Without even another glance,he said lazily,“Baby,I know you’re the best.You’ll understand me.I’m going to take a shower and a quick nap.Later this morning,come with me to scout the mall venue.”

Ken was always so sure that I would never leave him.

As the bathroom door shut,I looked at the door for a while and took a deep breath.Then I turned around and,one by one,threw all those once-precious pieces of“trash”into the garbage bin.

That included the matching couple mugs that I had bought but never used,travel photos,a souvenir keychain he had given me and little decor items I had once dreamed of putting on our wedding tables.

Seven years of love were tossed in an instant and strangely,I didn’t feel a thing.

Two hours later,after he took a shower and changed clothes,Ken and I headed to the mall to scout the venue.

As we walked past the entrance,a staff member mentioned,“Hey,there’s a new limited-edition collab milk tea next door.There is already a huge queue over there and they're only selling it today.”

Ken suddenly turned to me and asked,""Do you want it?

I froze and instinctively looked up at him.Was he actually…offering to buy something for me in public?

In seven years,he had never shown me the slightest affection or attention in front of others.

""I….""

Before I could even nod,he turned back with a smile and said to the people behind us,“Thanks for all your hard work,everyone.I’ll treat you to milk tea,one cup for each of you.”

My hand that was just hanging loose at my side clenched quietly,then slowly relaxed.

That man has not changed at all.

Emily,Emily,you’re about to walk away anyway.Why are you still hoping for here?

While waiting for the milk tea,I headed for a less crowded corner.

With a cup of milk tea in his hand,Ken walked through the crowd and went straight towards me.

He handed me the drink.“Here!I ordered this one especially for you.”

I glanced [down.It](http://down.It) was strawberry milk.

My fingers trembled slightly.I replied in a flat voice,“I don’t drink that.”

His brows furrowed and his tone instantly turned cold.""Emily,you’re being difficult [again.You](http://again.You) just said you wanted to drink milk tea before and now you’re saying you don’t?This is what everyone bought.What am I supposed to do with yours?Waste it?”



Chapter 4

I looked up at him gently and suddenly my eyes stung.

Seven years ago,he made a point to remember that I was allergic to strawberries.He said even a sip would make me swell up like crazy.Once,I accidentally drank the wrong milk and ended up in the hospital,He was so panicked,he cried in the hallway.

However,now,the man who once cried because of my allergy…couldn’t even remember the one thing I could not have.

I swallowed hard,but I could not take this anymore.“I think we should break….""

Before I could finish,a familiar voice cut me off.

“Boss!”

Hazel came bouncing over in her sugary-sweet voice and snatched the milk from his hand with a sweet smile.“This is the one I recommended to you yesterday,right?You really bought it today?You’re so good to me.”

As she spoke,she naturally hooked her arm around Ken’s.

Clearly,Ken was stumped for a moment and a flicker of awkwardness flashed across his face,but he did not push her away.

Then,as if something had suddenly entered her mind,Hazel tapped her head and gave me a small smile as she said,""Miss White…the boss treats me so well,so when do you think I should meet his family?By the way,do you have a boyfriend?Maybe you could give me some advice?”

My heart hurt so much that I could not get a single word out.

Ken gave me a frantic look.He silently begged me not to make a scene.

At that moment,I felt very tired.I took a deep breath and replied,“I don’t know.”

Ken quickly backed me up.""Yeah,General Assistant only knows how to work and doesn't know about this kind of stuff.""

Hazel looked disappointed.“Really?I thought you’d been in a relationship for a long time already,General Assistant.”

I looked down with a numb heart.

Even though she showed up to the site visit during working hours,which was totally against company policy,not only did Ken not rebuke her at all,he also let her tag along as they started the inspection process together.

When we passed one of the company’s catering brand stores,Hazel suddenly came up beside me and whispered sweetly,""Miss White,I’m a little nervous.Can we walk together?”

She smiled at me and then,without saying anything,she grabbed my wrist.

Annoyed,I tried to shake her off,but even though I did not use much force,she stumbled backward dramatically and his back slammed into an older man who was drinking soup with his head down.

Splash!

A whole bowl of hot soup spilled all over his pant leg.

The man’s face darkened,he shot to his feet and roared,“What the hell is wrong with you?Why did you push people?My pants are soaked!You better pay for this!”

I was petrified.

Before I could even react,Hazel lowered her head and started apologizing for her fault,""Sorry,I'm so sorry.I did not know why the general assistant suddenly pushed me.I really didn’t mean to disturb your lunch...”

She sounded so weak and pittiful,while I was like shrew that bullied her in public.

Suddenly,Ken yanked my wrist,his face twisted with anger as he snapped,""Emily,what the hell are you doing?Apologize.Now!”



Chapter 5

I looked up at him in disappointment and refuted him,“I didn’t push her!”

He disregarded my words and wrinkled his forehead.“Everyone’s watching,don’t ruin the company’s image.”

The older man squinted at us,his gaze shifting back and forth between me and [Hazel.In](http://hazel.in/) an instant,he figured out who the easier target was.

He suddenly grabbed my arm,his fingers dug painfully into my skin like he was afraid I would flee.He leaned extremely close toward me.His eyes were leering shamelessly at my chest.

“Come on,sweetheart,[apologize.You](http://apologize.You) spilled soup all over me and now you wanna act all high and mighty?”

Ken,who was standing on the side,was oblivious to the man's harassment of me because his attention was locked solely on Hazel.

Hazel lowered her head and bit her lips with a sad look on her face.""Boss,it was my fault.Please don’t blame Miss White.""

Ken immediately felt heartbroken.He patted her shoulder.It's not your fault.This is because the general assistant is so clumsy.""

My throat tightened.Just as I opened my mouth to say something,I heard Hazel softly say to the man,“I’m really sorry.I’ll pay for your pants,okay?I should’ve been steadier,so you failed to eat.""

Ken’s expression darkened as he turned to me.“See?Look how responsible Hazel is,but you?You don't even have a shred of decency.”

The next second,he picked up the leftover bowl of soup from the table and coldly dumped it right over my head.

The scalding soup with its oily smell immediately drenched me from the top of my head,stuck to my hair,soaked through my collar and trickled down slowly at the back of my neck.

At that moment,I felt completely numb.

Ken slammed the bowl back on the table and coldly said,“Emily,you’re heartless and [selfish.You](http://selfish.You) won’t even say sorry.”

The uncle smiled.His face was full of wrinkles.

“No wonder you’re the boss and she’s the boss lady,you two have good manners.You're not like these stubborn workers with no manners!”After he said that,he spat at me.

Ken didn’t even look back.He grabbed Hazel’s hand and walked away.

I was left there,standing alone,as the soup slowly dripped from my forehead,then it hit the floor with a tiny ticking sound.

I went home,changed my clothes and washed myself for three hours,but I still couldn’t wash off that disgusting stench.

I wrote my resignation letter word for word and took it with me to the office the next day.

As the elevator doors opened,the receptionist glanced up at me,her face was full of gossip.

""General Assistant,do you know what?The boss is so handsome while holding the boss lady's hand.""

I looked up.She grinned and handed me her phone,showing a photo of Ken and Hazel walking side by side.

In the dim light,he was holding her while my dejected back followed not far behind,covered in soup like an outsider.

“We didn’t even know you were behind them,General Assistant.""

She stiffened,suddenly realizing what she had said and quickly tucked her phone away.

“I'm sorry!We just thought they looked like the main couple in a novel or something.We got a little carried away…”

I didn’t say a word.I walked straight to the HR department and handed in my resignation letter.

The HR lady took a look at it and with a little surprise on her face,""Are you resigning?""

I nodded.“Yes.”

She hesitated,then said,“Yesterday,the boss proposed to Hazel and he even announced that the company’s no-dating policy is officially canceled.General Assistant…are you upset?""

My hand trembled and I almost dropped the resignation letter to the floor.

So,the rule that I had been waiting for seven years for,which was""the time isn't right yet"",that I had heard over and over again,could be cancelled with just a few words for Hazel.



Chapter 6

I said a few perfunctory comments and turned to leave.

Inside the office,someone was talking,""Can you believe the general assistant has been secretly in love with the president for so many years and yet,she never gets any acknowledgement at all.I bet she must be fuming right now.""

“Shhh…keep it down.She’s still here.”

I heard every word,crystal clear.

In their eyes,the fact that I loved Ken was so obvious.Meanwhile,as for Ken,no one could ever tell whether he liked me back or not.

I just smiled,then went back to my office to continue organizing the handover documents.Actually,I could just walk out,but I had been working in the company for seven years and I needed a closure.

Just when I was about to save the data,suddenly,the office door swung open nd Hazel barged in without warning.

""Hai,Emily,""she sneered.""Are you still organizing the data?

She shut the door behind her and smirked.“Too [bad.No](http://bad.No) matter how hard you work,you’ll never beat someone with the title‘CEO’s fiancée’.”

I paused working on the keyboard,then looked up at her calmly.

Hazel stepped closer.

“I've actually known for a while that you're the girlfriend Ken's been secretly dating for a long time,but it doesn't matter.I was the one Ken proposed,wasn't I?""

“We were high school classmates,you know…and we had a little fling back then.”

""Do you know that when we bumped into each other at a reunion,we were so passionate that he immediately brought me into the company

After she laid out all the facts for a long time,she finally got to the point.

“Emily,if you know better,you should just step aside.”

I stared at her face nonchalantly and answered coldly,“I’m working.Please leave.”

Hazel laughed like I’d told her the funniest joke.“Working?You think you still have a place here?”

Before I could react,she moved like a blur and I was unprepared for what came next.

Smack!

A sharp sound echoed.She did not slap me,but slapped herself.A red handprint bloomed across her cheek and tears welled up instantly.She pretended to look panicked.

""Ah!""

She screamed,then grabbed my coffee and threw it onto her chest.The hot liquid soaked her blouse,dripped down her arms and flowed onto my open laptop.

I jerked to my feet,“You're insane!”

The sound of a short circuit was heard and the computer screen went black instantly.

The handover documents and project backup files I had spent three days and nights on were all gone.

I saw red and my control finally snapped.I could not take it anymore and grabbed her collar as anger exploded within me.

“Hazel!You’ve gone too far!”

She screamed,stumbled back,knocked a chair,then she pushed me away and bolted for the door.

She was crying as she ran and threw herself into Ken's arms,who just happened to pass by.

“Ken!”she sobbed.“I only wanted to apologize…to Miss White,but she was jealous because you poured soup on her.She tried to pour soup on me,too and I did not dodge it.She even hit me….""

She cried so hard,as if she had really suffered greatly.

Ken’s eyes narrowed at me.They were cold and ruthless.

“Emily,how could you be so vicious?”

He marched over.There was no trace of doubt or hesitation in his eyes.

After high school, we lost touch for a little bit but a year we graduated, we started hanging out again. A couple months ago she asked me to take her into the city because Joanne’s was closing and they were having a sale (she said she would pay for my gas). Across the street from said Joanne’s was an outdoor mall and I wanted to walk around and see what was over there and when I told her I wanted to go to walk around and shop she looked at me in disgust and kept questioning why I wanted to go. She eventually sighed and agreed. Finally we check out of Joanne’s and finally make it to the outdoor mall and when we were there, I saw a wedding dress shop, and I asked her like like let’s pass by and look at the dresses in the window, and she turns to me and says why? why do you want to look at those dresses. you’re not getting married anytime soon and I was kind of taken a back because it was rude. So I told her I just like looking at them. They’re really cute. In the same shopping area there was a good restaurant and I asked her if she wanted to go eat and she told me no she wanted to go somewhere else which was fine, but I was really looking forward to that restaurant. so later on we get to the restaurant she wanted to go to and she paid for our food and I paid for the drinks and upon leaving I had leftovers and my hands were full and I asked her for the time because I had a date with my long-distance boyfriend (FaceTime call) and she continued to question me asking me. Why do I wanna know the time? And upon going home, she never offered to pay for my gas. Fast-forward to a couple weeks ago, she texted me when I was at work asking if we can hang out so she can vent and I agreed and I told her I get off work at a certain time and she said OK so I end up going to pick her up after I get off work and she starts crying about this guy she was talking to and while crying she asked me if I can take her to work the next day and she would pay for my gas and I said OK yeah that’s fine so when we were hanging out, we stop at a gas station and I was gonna pay for my gas because I assumed she was gonna give me cash the next day but she just pulled out her credit card and put the card in right away when I was going to pay for it so fast-forward to drop her off and I go home instantly fall asleep, cause I had a long day at work, and when I wake up, she sends me at least six voice messages of her basically being cross faded and crying about the situation with the guy. I pick her up for work and she basically tells me that she reached out to another guy she spoke to before and now they’re friends again and she tells me that guy who started talking to again works in the same area I do and I asked her oh what’s his name? Maybe I know him and she turns to me and says none of your business. She’s like not to sound like a bitch or anything, but why do you wanna know? I don’t know why she’s being rude to me, but I haven’t talked to her since that situation because I feel like she treats me unfairly and very rude even when I take her places and try to help, when she asks me to can anyone give advice?
*Other situations that happen are when waiting in line for coffee, she puts her head on my shoulder and looks at my phone to see what i’m doing, when someone calls she asks who it is, and she saw i had reddit installed on my phone and asked why i had it",1,1747290108.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
