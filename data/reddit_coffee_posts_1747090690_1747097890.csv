Nothing elaborate.

But it feels indulgent enough.

I've been thinking about drinks lately. Not just what we sip, but how. The ones that invite slowness, the ones we reach for in a rush, the ones that cost too much in time or money.

I put together a guide on which drinks are worth the effort to make, which ones are better bought, and how to turn even the simplest store-bought sips into something quietly luxurious.

Some drinks just aren’t worth the DIY effort (hi, mushroom coffee!), while others are surprisingly easy and fun to make at home. But my favorite thing is to buy something store-bought and elevate it to something fancier. 

Here’s the guide, if you’re curious. [https://www.curryforest.com/post/sip-smart-when-to-buy-not-brew](https://www.curryforest.com/post/sip-smart-when-to-buy-not-brew)",1,1747097708.0,JustEnoughJoy,0,1.0,False

1kl929l,https://www.reddit.com/r/chibike/comments/1kl929l/inquiry_chicago_milwaukee_training_and_preparation/,Inquiry - Chicago --> Milwaukee (training and preparation),"Top of the evening.

  
Getting back into cycling this year (took 2024 off by accident and due to the curse of convenience of electric scooters). Have been a regular cyclist for years before but not too familiar with longer trips (I'd say the most I ever did was close to 30 mi for the day). Had my eyes on the Chicago to Milwaukee route for some time now and think I'd like to attempt it this summer.

I'm waiting on a delivery of a new bike (Cannondale Quick CX 3) anytime this week (old one got stolen sometime during the winter) and the obvious first step is to shake off the rust and start with smaller trips, building up the distance over time. 

  
In my better days (3-4 years ago)( I could go go as high as 22 mph/h over shorter distances but guessing that will go down due to becoming decrepit + it's my understanding that the travelling path from CHI to MKE is 1/3(?) gravel.

  
Could use some general advice from the vets and diehards as to how longer bike trips can and should be tackled.

Obviously not looking to have my hand held and I'm guessing that I'll figure out what needs adjustment and what is missing as I ramp up the daily rides:

\- **Getting back into shape and training** \- outside of keeping up with the daily rides I was thinking on going to and from the Botanical Gardens to practice longer distance, half day trips (it's about 20 miles from my place to the Botanical Gardens, making the round trip 40 miles). Maybe there are some other practice routes that you could suggest? I'd rather not do the same trip back and forth too many times to keep it as fresh and engaging as possible

\- **Hydration** \- 2x 0.6L water bottles attached to the frame, 1x 2L water bladder to have in the backpack (replace with a camelback instead? Would rather not have a backpack at all). Most certainly will be stopping on the way to replenish

\- **Food** \- breakfast (coffee + bacon & eggs on an English muffin); to take with: snickers bar, 2x sandwiches (ham and cheese, something like that), 2x bananas. Currently looking into energy gels and chews (any advice?); I know to eat something a 1-1.5h into the trip and from that point on snack on about once each hour

\- **Entertainment** \- small clip on speaker or silence (headphones dangerous and thus not recommended?)

\- **Clothes** \- shorts + padded underwear, light t-shirt, converse high tops and sunglasses; bringing along 2x t-shirts, 3x undies, 3x socks and windbreaker

 \- **Luggage** \- rear bike rack + 2x 30L pannier bags, top tube bike (for snacks + phone + power bank) and triangle bag for tools and etc.

\- **Tools, repairs and first aid** \- bike multitool (Crankbrothers 19), multitool (Leatherman Wingman), tube repair kit (REMA TT 02 Tour Patch Kit, Large), portable air pump, 1x replacement inner tube, 2x tire levers, 2x rags, zip ties, 2x power banks (10000 and 20000 mAh), charging cords, two U bike locks + cable

\- **PPE, hygiene and first aid** \- Helmet, front + tail lights, sunscreen, wet wipes, first aid kit (gauze, surgical tape, band aids, non-adherent pads, alcohol prep pads, various pills for stomach ache, headache, etc.)

\- **GPS** \- it seems that RideWithGPS is a good option (https://ridewithgps.com/routes/43302287), as well as  the paid version of Komoot. Will definitely steer clear of Google Maps and such. Will be using my phone

\- **Schedule and date** \- to allow time for training I'm thinking about early July, looking to depart Chicago early around (around 6 AM - I'm an early riser anyways)

\- **Hospitality** \- will inquire for a hotel in Milwaukee that will let me store the bicycle inside. The plan is to spend the night there, hang out a bit the next day and take the Metra back

\- **Safety and backup options** \- will notify multiple contacts regarding the trip details and proposed schedule. Have a second phone with a different carrier (just in case). In case I decide to back out of the trip I can hop on the closest Metra stop (correct?)

So this is the basic structure draft that I've put together so far.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and suggestions.

Keep on keeping on!

On a recent trip to El Salvador, I had the chance to visit Alquimia, a café ranked 14th BEST in the world, and it genuinely lived up to the reputation.

Everything from the atmosphere to the craftsmanship behind each cup was on point. The owner, Federico Bolaños, has coached multiple world barista champions, and you can feel that attention to detail in every part of the experience. But what really stuck with me was the energy: calm, intentional, and creative. It reminded me that coffee isn’t just a beverage, it’s a ritual, a craft, and a reflection of culture.

One of the most interesting parts of my visit was getting to taste different elements of the whole coffee plant, not just the beans in the brewed cup, but the cherries, the cascara, and even the mucilage during processing. It made me think:
Have you ever had the chance to taste coffee at different stages of the process? If so, what stood out to you the most?

*Chapter 1: Light Work*

I've lived in SWFL my whole life. Halfway between wild and urban. Opulent and shabby. Mansions and crack dens. Beachfront and deep swamp. You don't realize how rich some people are until you drive through some of these subdivisions in Naples. All that money, and unless you're a talented bartender, it doesn't quite trickle down, especially in September. In Florida, our only two seasons are hurricane and tourist. So, this past month, when the market decided to take a shit, I decided it was time to find a second job. 

""Isaiah Combs 8-10 Live"" An A-frame blackboard sign read outside the only barren bar on the bustled street. I lugged in my PA, eyes darting from the marble bar top, bleach-white walls, and in stark contrast to the more fashionable nature of the rest of the bar; metal signs, with messages printed reading ""If you ain't fallen over yet you need another beer!"" and ""If beer isn't the answer you're asking the wrong question!"" that would be more at home in your boomer uncle's man cave that he fully furnished with Temu and Hobby Lobby. 4 or 5 years ago someone cared about this place. Had an elegant vision of a locale with all the class of a 5-star hotel lobby bar. That was until a new owner or manager, what have you, said to themself ""This is not what bar look like! Bar have pool table and dart board!""

My eyes met the bartender's and I saw the look in his eye before I saw him. He didn't want to be here as much as I did. He couldn't be much older than me, late-20s black button-down with a black tie. I wasn't sure if my polo was out of place yet.

""Can I help you with something, man?"" He had an accent to his voice I couldn't place outside of being European. 

""Yeah, I'm Isaiah, I'm playing here tonight. Liza didn't tell me where she wanted me to set up over the phone."" 

The bartender gestured to the vacant floor space in front of the touchtune, next to an ornate vintage wine cabinet. I bent my knees and carried my speakers to their destination. I could see a line on the floor where the linoleum was faded. Separated only by the black gunk from where a runner rug used to be duct taped down and no one thought it would be a good idea to spray some goo-gone before the tracks of months to years worth of patrons made it a permanent fixture of this hodgepodge. 

I finished setting up in record time as there were no drunks giving me the ""I'm gonna shout Free Bird as loud as I fucking can in about 10 to 15 minutes"" stare. No drunks or anyone for that matter. Just me and Bartender, he told me his name but for the life of me, I couldn't piece together the noise he made in a way that made sense phonetically. 

I jammed there by myself for an hour, an old man shuffled in looking for the bathroom. My tip jar remained as dry as a flood-controlled swamp. The calloused skin on my fingers flaked off with each successful chord change. The clock drudged forward getting closer to 10 pm. By this time a regular was seated at the far end of the bar away from me. I rigged up my harp rack with a G Harmonica to play Seminole Wind. 


When I was a little kid my dad used to take me on expeditions out in the Everglades. He had this story he told me about the skunk ape, basically South Florida's version of Bigfoot. I ate that shit up. We would pack a sack with bologna and cheese sandwiches, Deep Woods Off with 40% DEET, flashlights, binoculars, fishing gear, and the whole nine yards to go spend the day cavorting out in the swamp searching for signs of the elusive creature. The 2001 Saturn Vue hit Alligator Alley like Magellan on the high sea. Uncharted paved territory as waves of yellow, orange, and pink strobed between the trees in the early hours of daylight. The summer heat cascaded over our skin as we sat, getting eaten alive by mosquitoes, under a cypress tree and enjoying our lunch that day. We never had any luck, I'm still hopeful there's stuff like that out there though. I've always had a fascination with the strange but I'm rational. I know there's likely no Bigfoot, skinwalkers, or most cryptids. Then again, if there are any out there it's just a part of nature we haven't found yet. Nothing really supernatural about it. 

That doesn't stop me from being cautious when going out on trails though.
My phone rang. It was Harry. He was the one who got me this shit gig, but hey, at least I would walk home with two hundred and fifty bucks. Harry had recently been promoted to good friend after spending quite some time in the acquaintance-zone. Everyone has quirks and flaws but sometimes, Harry was a bit to stomach.

""Yooo big dog!"" Harry called out from my phone, ""How's the Hideout? Makin' stacks?""

""Not particularly, there's one dude here and he hasn't taken an eye off his beer since he sat down like 10 minutes ago."" I leaned against the wall separating the out-of-order men's room and ladies' room as my iPad ran the show.

""Mannn, that sucksss dude. If I'm gonna be honest I do not like Liza. Bitch vibes.""

""Yeah, I don't know dude,"" I remembered the old guy from earlier and wondered if he used the women's restroom.

""Oh bro bro, before I forget. You're still looking for something steady right?""

Harry was about to save my ass again. ""Dude, I'm always looking, what do ya got?""

""Okay, so my uncle's friend or something right, he was chilling and told me he needed some extra help at some wildlife sanctuary or nature trail type shit.""

""What type of work?""

""Bro bro bro, it's nothing. It's a big animal research center in the middle of fucking nowhere and they just need a guy.""

""A guy to do what?""

""Men shit. Watch the place, pick up heavy things when they got em. Like security and stuff mostly.""

""This place is just in the middle of woods somewhere?""

""Yeah bro, security on that place is easy money dog. Deep out in Fakahatchee or Picayune I think. There's no one for miles, you just gonna be on the radio like 'uuhh there's a bear, and nothing else' and that's a band!""

The man on the other end of the bar began a coughing fit. The bartender didn't so much as look up from his phone. I squinted through the dimly lit bipolarly decorated room to see he was wearing AirPods.

""Harry, text me your uncle's cousin's roommate's number please.""

""Type shit. Let me know if Liza gives you shit tonight, she stiffed me last week.""




*Chapter 2: Naithlorendum*

Monday afternoon I drove out to the Gore Research Center. This place was in the boonies. There's a funny thing about Florida. It's similar to how the rest of the country is, just shrunk down and set the dial from low to high. Most of the people are on the coast and that's where all the money is. But you drive like 25 minutes and might as well be in Louisiana. I live about 10 minutes from one of the Bidens and another 20 minutes from there my dad found an upturned skiff housing a bale of marijuana. I didn't know they came in bales. Word of the wise, never try to stab one of those thinking you might just take a little bit. Those things are super compact. They had prison crews cleaning up for a couple of days.

I had been driving to meet the woman in charge of the facility for about 30 minutes now. Sedan was not the vehicle for the job. It had rained about four days ago, which was uncommon that time of year. The relative dryness was in my favor. I turned right off Golden Gate Parkway to head deep into the Picayune Strand State Forest. On Desoto, traffic slowly waned as the roads fell into disrepair. Homes that scattered the county road became less and less common. Less and less kept. American flags turn to Trump flags. Trump flags turn to rebel flags. Rebel flags turn to trees. 

After a few miles passed, I came upon a road sign. 

“End County Maintenance.”  

*Thud.* The car lurched from the asphalt to the cruel limestone sand and dirt, throwing a cloud behind me as I vibrated down the landscape.

A majority of the journey had become unpaved. I had never been out that way. There's an almost unending maze of lefts and rights out there. RV's parked out in the middle of clearings, doing God knows what, strange wooden encampment suspended between the trees. I passed a dead deer around 130th Ave. 

I pulled up to the gate about two hours before sunset. My battle-weary Hyundai splattered with mud, dirt, and grime idled waiting for the gate to open.
I checked my messages with the contact I was given. Not delivered. I had one bar of LTE this far out which honestly surprised me. I sent a new message informing her I was outside. In wait, I took stock of my surroundings. 3 Signs on a post reading:

“No Trespassers KEEP OUT”

""Naithloriendum Wildlife Sanctuary""

And the third, ""Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? Ecclesiastes 7:17""


It was only a few moments before the front gate roared into life. 
The house was something out of Swiss Family Robinson. Towering on all sides were live oaks, cypress, and ficus trees. The unkempt driveway led to a winding staircase encroached on by a strangler fig. Jasmine vines climbed the banister on the front porch up to the second floor, its wilted white flowers speckled on the duff. Spanish moss covered the trees and shrouded the home drawing the eye to an observation deck on what looked to be the third floor. It was as if nature was reclaiming what was once hers.

She must've been in her early 60's. The gray roots just creeping up from her tightly packed jet-black hair. ""Isaiah, so good to see you!"" She called out from the front door. Her voice was much louder than you'd expect for the distance between us. I had to match the energy, ""Deb! Nice to finally meet in person!""

Feeling some sort of need to take control of this altogether new setting I found myself in, I quickly closed the distance between her and I. Scaling the derelict staircase with a hand outstretched. My enthusiasm, to me, felt outside the bounds of societal convention. The gentle breeze against my palm, as I swung it ahead, made it all too clear that clammy beads of sweat had formed. 

""Come in son, I'll let you get your bearings."" Deb showed me inside an immaculately clean house. House is the wrong word. It was unlived in. No utilitarian furnishings like TVs or kitchen appliances outside of a coffee maker seated on the welcome desk. Above the desk, there was a portrait of a smiling white-haired, bearded old man, with a golden retriever, seated on the front step of the old staircase. Before the strangler fig made its debut.

Deb tossed her jean jacket onto a coat rack by the front door and turned towards me clasping her hands together and teetering from heel to toe. ""Well! Welcome to the education center. This is, of course, Dr.Bob's former home. We do tours, and craft days, and uh the occasional field trip. Well. Un-occasional. It's a bit- just a bit far and obscure and too much of a negative connotation for the schools you know. Anyway! That doesn't stop any of the great work we do!"" Deb's eyes lit up at this. 

""So this is a uh conservation collier restoration site. Basically we are working to uh return this area to its natural habitat. This is a cypress hardwood, damn no it's a uh, hardwood, cypress, swamp, forest. Hardwood cypress swamp forest. While being both in the Picayune Strand we are also smack dab in the middle of uh Big cypress's Critical Area of State Concern."" Deb made her way to the rear of the house, passing photographs and newspapers strewn along the wall captioned like it would be at a museum.

""We work to create awareness and of course have boots on the ground here"" She spun to look at me. ""During the day."" She spun back. ""We document tree growth, panther population, water quality, you name it. The further people are from these uh vital environments the more they tend to do well. Flourish.""

We crossed a corridor, sealed by a red velvet rope and two greening, once golden stanchions. I peeked inside seeing one of those wheeled step ladders you see in old libraries. I adjusted my gaze back toward her, ""Keep Florida wild!"" I chimed in.

""Exactly! Yes, that's so good. I like that.""

I felt bad that I was just repeating some Instagram caption I had seen. We both stood there for a moment. I just smiled and nodded through the silence.

""OH,"" she exclaimed, clapping her hands together once more. ""W-9 and stuff I'll drop by when I um come to meet you in the morning. Let me show you a little bit around here now."" She made an about-face towards the front door.

""This was Robert's entertaining area. It was used only by him though. Little to no visitors, those who knew him described him as a bit of a curmudgeon. Eccentric too."" She led me to the front reception, and again I saw posted above the door the word ""Naithlorendum""

I grabbed my phone from my pocket to google it. Just as we're rounding the desk to  climb up a second-story staircase Deb interrupts.""Most of what you will need you can find in or under here. Including a charger."" She grabbed the lightning cable and handed it to me. ""Thanks""

""Ab-so-lutly! Now follow me up here and I'll show you some of the exhibits."" As Deb grabbed the guard rail to the staircase she knocked on it three times. We ascended and the age of this building began to show, the air got more still and I could smell the faint nostalgic aroma of mildew. The musty air swirled in vapors as Deb reached for a brittle yellowed light switch at the top of the stairs. ""*Click*” 		

Nothing.

""This damn-"" She flicked it on and off three times and the overhead fluorescents buzzed, spattered, and awoke with all the vigor of a model T. A taxidermied bear, a few wild boar, a buck and a doe, a bald eagle, gopher tortoises, and a few otters in a menagerie of nature frozen in death. The wall to the left had a nearly 6-foot-long tarpon. 

Deb pointed to the bald eagle ""Don't worry, that's incredibly old."" She must've misinterpreted the bewildered look on my face for concern. Deb went on to explain some of the origins of the animals, or fun facts, or something while I took steps to mentally document my surroundings. Further on into the upstairs, there was a door. Plain wooden door with a black painted profile of a wild hog. I made my approach.

""That's the Pig Room."" Deb plainly stated in monotone.

Instinctively I almost blurted out ""The fuck?"" But I caught myself when I turned and faced this short kind-eyed woman who just so happened to be my new boss.

""Pardon""

""The Pig Room""

""Is that-""

""Exactly what you think it is? Yes""

Well, fucking thank you, Deb. I have not a clue in the world what the hell that means. She misread my expression again. She charged forward and opened the door. 

Frankly, there isn't anything I would have called it outside of the Pig Room. Speckled shadows crept through the doorway. A curtained window obscured by the mess of jasmine outside was the only light source. Deb trodded to the center of the room and pulled a cord. Illuminated now was a man's life's work. Glass cases and dioramas. Jars and diagrams. Sketches, notes, photographs, and all dedicated to the pigs. 

There was an old padauk wood bookcase brimmed with a dozen or more jars of fetal pigs suspended in formaldehyde. On another shelf, there were books like ""The Merck Veterinary Manual Eleventh Edition"" bound in navy canvas with silver foil lettering. Another read “The Embryology of  The Pig Second Edition,” with a maroon cover and gold foil emboss. The other shelves were dotted with body parts, trinkets and journals; including a crate filled with 30 to 40 boar tusks. Tacked to the wall was a photocopy of a textbook that read ""Chapter 7 The Structure of Embryos from Nine to Twelve Millimeters in Length,"" on the second page was a diagram of a curled and squashed mass. Little slits for eyes, its shape that of a manatee more than a pig. The center of the room was a stainless steel table. It slanted off slightly towards the opposite wall into a drain. A small trough lined the table, inside were medical instruments like scalpels a bone saw, and other things I didn't recognize. On the other end of the room was a meticulously constructed display, a paper-thin slice of a pig under glass. There were 6 in all,  the same size but different areas of the body. White cartilage encased in meat around the thing's snout, and a cavity with a perfectly round white mass. Organs and bones were perfectly preserved in place and time like some 4th-dimensional creature had trapped the hog there then and now.

I ran my hand along the trough of the operation table, its cool surface had seen years of scratches and wearing. 

I turned my head and caught a glimpse of the cages. Eight separate cages empty of tenants, but exuded an energy of melancholy. Old dusty stained hay and straw lie on the ground of each cell which were only about 2 and a half feet in width and 5 feet deep. The room had no distinct scent.

""Bob took his research very seriously,"" Yeah no shit Deb, I don't think they sell pig slices on Amazon. ""The advancements made in veterinary medicine by Bob are astounding really.""

I took stock of the shelves, textbooks, and general macabre set. ""Well, I can say this is not exactly what I was expecting.""

Deb huffed and shrugged. Knocking on the door three times as she exited and turned towards the next floor up. 

Once completing our tour I followed my boss out to the driveway. 

""I'll be back in the morning around 8 to get the report of the night. There's usually as you'd likely expect, not too much activity. If you get bored I have filing in Bob's downstairs study that has to be done. There's a crudités platter in the uh break room fridge I think.""

""Thank you, Deb, I really appreciate this opportunity.""

""Ab-so-lutly Isaiah. Don't let the isolation get to you now.""

With that she twirled her keys, clicking the unlock thrice. She clambered up into her dark green Jeep Wrangler and kicked a dust cloud behind her as she left. I strolled out after her seeing her car grow smaller until turning off Desoto back towards civilization. The machines roar waning and waning until… silence.


*Chapter 3: Plink*

I took a right turn down 40th Avenue and spotted a sign not too far off. 
""*Dr.Robert H. Gore III Preserve*""

""Hell yeah,"" I instinctively muttered. My sneakers made the satisfying gravel on-sole crunch as I lightly jogged to the trailhead. Twilight had just begun to set in when I rounded the 2-mile loop sign. The forest greeted me with an ospreys coo overhead, no other sounds but the gentle breeze swaying between leaves, needles, and palmetto branches. The occasional snap and crack; sounds of the wilderness my brain was once so accustomed to. I started a hike on my Apple Watch. My legs needed a stretch after that tumultuous ride. My mind needed a stretch after the interview with Deb, if you could call it that. What did she mean by ""don't let the isolation get to you?"" 

I realized after an indeterminate amount of time walking I hadn't been paying close attention to my surroundings. A mossy oak entwined with a sable palm to my right. To my left numerous old Florida pines engrossed by vegetation. Some were full of life, others rotting and brimming with woodpecker burrows. To my front, a narrowing path of toppled palms. To my back, rapidly dwindling daylight.

I had to pick up my pace. 

The more obscured view had made the more treacherous terrain more treacherous. The once smoothly mowed path was now dotted with rocks, branches, and root systems climbing into the overworld. The taller grass made little foot-sized holes vague and unclear. As I made my attempt to bound as quickly and safely as I could through the forest, every squeak, every bird call, every flutter of wings got louder. A branch caught my arm, breaking skin and spilling first blood.  As the evening's light drew closer to the Earth it made the bird's shadows above appear like Thunderbirds in a cat 5. Branches made to be the arms and claws of Mother Nature herself, snatching me back to dust. I reached into my pocket for my phone. I had left it on the front desk. 

I didn't have a flashlight.

I stopped dead in my tracks. The pit that had formed in the back of my throat from breathing in the cold Florida air dropped down into my chest. Decision-making hindered, fear’s vice grip on my throttle, I picked up the pace. 

I've hiked at night before, technically speaking, but that trail was 714 feet long. You can map it with your eyes closed. In all new territory, while technically on the clock, I've gotten myself much deeper than I had hoped. I'm not lost. The trail is just a loop; there's only one way in and the same way out. Or so I thought. I rounded the corner and there was a dead end. Surrounded by nothing but a thicket of vegetation and densely packed palmettos. I still wasn't lost. I could just turn around and go the same way I came. The orange-colored sky had fully desaturated and turned to an inky black. I bounded down the trail through the night with wanton disregard for the stones and roots that lay in my path. I had to get out of here as soon as possible. Palmetto branches brushed my shoulders. The deep sounds of my footfalls were only drowned out by my huffing and puffing. 

My left foot wedged itself underneath a root. As soon as I realized what was happening, I had already hit the ground. The little panicked breaths that had filled my lungs all rushed out in a single moment as my chest became well acquainted with the forest floor. My left hand scuffed against dirt and leaves, and my right palm grazed the surface of a moss-covered stone. If there was any air left in my lungs, I would have laughed at myself. That is until I realized the sound of  footsteps continued after I fell.

Call it delirium, call it adrenaline, but I could've sworn that as I was falling I could hear footsteps continuing in my pace. My cheek lying on the ground and eyesight serving me no good, I became intensely aware of the sounds and smells in my immediate vicinity. 

I heard nothing. No birds. No rodents. No twigs snapping. No rustling critters in the brush. Just the gentle breeze, whistling through the Palmetto branches and leaves. If only for a second the area reeked of ammonia and urine. A subtle presence of rotting fruit and eggs filled the air. Through the aches, and the pains I all of a sudden had the feeling like I was being watched. Like all at once, a colony of eyes transfixed on my crumpled heap. 

Fear froze me there in time. ""If it's black: fight back, if it's brown: lie down."" There aren't any brown bears in Florida as far as I know, so this is gonna have to be a fighting-back scenario. Unless the rules change if you're already lying down. There's only one way out of here and it's forward and if there is something in here it's behind me so I've got that going.

""*Plink*"" 

""What the hell was that,"" I thought to myself. 

""*Plink*""

It was closer this time. It sounded like something had fallen about three or four feet from my head.

""*Plink*""

""Shit,"" I instinctively muttered, breaking the unspoken rule of silence the forest had set upon me. I could see it now, a rock. A tiny little rock must have just landed right in front of my face.

""*Plink*""

I think something just lobbed a rock past my head.

The pain in my body all at once became the lowest priority I had. I pushed against the limestone and dirt, jolting my body upright. I spun to look for what lay in wait just behind my back.

Nothing.

No way in hell I was about to wait for whatever it was to show itself. Heart and mind racing at breakneck speed, my feet matched their tempo. I expertly dashed through the remaining trail. Rocks, holes, and branches were becoming more and more sparse. The back lip of my shoes ripped and tore at my Achilles tendon. My heart pounded and pounded until it felt like it was about to wriggle its way through my ribs and fall out. My lungs heaved air rapidly, the speed exasperated by the tremendous effort engaged by both my legs and amygdala.

 I could hear more footsteps than mine. I was being pursued. Instinct took over. Adrenaline guided my path and my conscious mind fell into complete blindness. I was no longer human. I was prey. Run. It’s right there. Run. I emerged at the trailhead moments later and it all flooded back. I peeked over my shoulder as I hit the road and ran back towards Naithlorendum. My pursuers had remained on the trail.

I scaled the strangled staircase and slammed the door behind me. The silence of the space was absolutely deafening. I leaned against the door and followed it down to the floor. I lay there for a short time. 

My mind flickered and adjusted back to reality. Fear had gripped each muscle fiber and tendon in my body. Reason began to administer its soothing medicine of denial.

The air was still, and frigid. I started to recognize some things not made all too clear by Deb. There's no air conditioning in this house. How does a house in the middle of Florida not have central heating and air? I went to the downstairs restroom to survey the damage. 

My palms were red and sore but altogether fine. I was covered in dirt and leaves, and there were a few deep scratches on my left cheek. The blood from my arm was slowly coagulating. I looked like hell but otherwise all right. I started running the sink so I could clean the cuts. I shook the dirt off my clothes into the bathtub. I winced when I took off my left sneaker. I've never broken a toe before, but I know they're not supposed to be purple. 
I met my gaze in the mirror. "" What the hell was that?"" I folded up a sheet of toilet paper and dabbed cold water around the cuts that would distract from the dark circles under my eyes. I was tired, maybe even overtired.

""Was there anything there at all?"" A voice rose from the back of my head.

""No, no! I know what I saw.""

""What did you see?""

I couldn't answer that part of myself. I didn't actually see anything. But I knew what I heard.

""But what did you hear?""

Footsteps, the rock. I could—

""Rationally explain everything?""

The forest was dark, my adrenaline was pumping, and my mind could've been playing tricks on me. A coyote or less agreeably a panther could be a logical explanation. Any explanation though required too much mental gymnastics to make sense. My brain was already stiff and rigid and exercise was the last thing it needed. 

I would have gone out to my car to get my guitar to get my mind on something , but there's a better chance of finding the winning lottery ticket in a haystack while also being struck by lightning in a frozen-over Hell than me going back out there any time soon. I plopped onto the couch in front of the massive limestone fireplace. I needed to rest my eyes for a moment. Every blink fell heavier and heavier. The day's troubles exchanged the weight held by my heart to the eyelids.

I was out for 5 minutes. 

For the next hour, I explored the interior of my new job site. If the Pig Room was anything to go off of, there had to be more than what meets the eye. Dr.Gore was an established author and I found a few of his books in his study. Nothing on pigs. Aside from the swine's carnival of terrors placed directly over my head nothing seemed out of the ordinary. This tiny museum, a display of a man's life and passion, deep out in the sticks about twenty miles east of nowhere. What was the point of it all? Why keep it standing and open for visitors? These questions swirled in my psyche until one thought elbowed its way through the crowd and made itself a front-row seat in my mind.

""Why am I here?""

Tonight's wages would be the tipping point for me to afford health insurance this month, tomorrow's would pay for a week of meal kits. 

Not why I, personally, am here. Why would they have anyone here? What am I protecting and what am I protecting from? 

I'm just here to ""keep an eye on things"" right? This revelation bothered me as I mounted up to the very crest of the stairs and entered the cupola. As I paced circles around the observation deck another question had dispersed the crowd and made itself the only voice crying out in the wasteland of thought.

""Don't let the isolation get to you.""

Deb's final words to me were a harbinger of sorts. I limped up the stairs, purple-toed with an abrasion-littered face because I let it get to me. I was going mad. Paranoid. If I didn't have an immediate personality switch I wouldn't make it through the night.

*""Plink.""*

My blood ran cold. My temples pounded like a pair of timpani in a ritardando as my peripheral vision tightened down to a single point. Frozen in space and time, I waited for more noise. Five agonizingly slow minutes pass. I was surrounded on all sides by glass and on the other side of the glass nothing but the Spanish moss and darkness. A steady overcast of cumulonimbus had drowned the stars and dim crescent moonlight. Wind howled through the trees in a mighty crescendo until: *""plink.""*

There is no way I imagined it because I saw it this time. I saw a pebble hit the window. I staggered back and became instantly aware of the fishbowl I had myself in. I decided the windowless room of the downstairs study would be safe, so I carefully climbed down the stairs. The soulless visage of the taxidermy bear shot me daggers as I made it to the second floor. I avoided the animals not wanting to get close. 

It had gotten even colder downstairs, a draft that sent goosebumps across my body. Rounding the welcome desk I snatched my phone from the charger. It hadn't charged, in fact, it was down to 20%. 

The wind was getting louder as I put my hand on the golden stanchion. A yellow-aged newspaper clipping on the desk caught my eye.

*""December 19, 2000

Homeowner Shoots at Alleged Trespasser's Vehicle, One Teen Dead.""*

I heard a rattling noise from the back of the house. It sounded like a branch on hurricane shutters. I ignored the study and crept towards the back of Naithlorendum. The window was open.

As the wind swept through the house I knew I wasn't alone. I was waiting for that little part of me, that thought my pursuer in the forest was a hallucination, to apologize. 

I heard a clattering noise upstairs. Like something had just tripped on one of the taxidermy projects. 

Eggs, fruit, ammonia, and urine. The scent had filled the air like a noxious perfume. It had found me.



*Chapter 4: Keep Florida Wild*

""I don't care how much I'm getting paid, I'm not staying here another minute,"" I muttered as I pulled out of the driveway. I turned onto Desoto to make the hour-long trek back to civilization and out of this God-forsaken wood. I pulled out my phone and sent a message to Deb. 

""shit went down tonight. I don't know WTF is going on up here but I want no part of it. front gate closed and door if locked, key under the mat. If you knew what I was getting into im very disappointed"" 

Not delivered. I had no service at all now. While it was on my mind, I attempted to send a message to Harry: 

""hey bro, who the hell told you about this gig at the nature center? there is some crazy shit up here""

The Hyundai's brights illuminated the street, a bright white tunnel through the towering pines. Mud, dust, and dirt kicked up and splattered against my car's already abused frame. Even with no one on the road I maintained 35 miles an hour. The scarlet beacon of my tail light illuminated a solitary figure dart across the street behind me. It was a child. 

At two in the morning, on a back-county road, deep in an old Florida state forest, a four-foot-tall child just ran behind my car, narrowly avoiding death.

Normally I would stop, but the woods couldn't pull one over me like that. It had gotten me out here but nothing was going to stop me. Something could slow me down. You see, most Januarys in Florida get one total day of rainfall. Well, apparently tonight was day two.

The sky's levee had overflowed and a free fall of rain engulfed my vehicle. My vehicle, the trees, and more importantly the dirt road. The rough and rocky terrain ahead began to mold and shift. My tires cut grooves into the earth as water began to break up the loam.

With full focus and attention on my surroundings, the corner of my vision caught something in the rearview.

The child was chasing my car.

At an inhuman speed, the silhouette steadily sprinted through the slurry kicking up behind my back tires. My fingers fumbled to switch my car into sport mode. I slammed my foot to the gas pedal and lurched forward. Anything not tied down had slipped and fell towards the back seat as I pumped the accelerator and gripped the steering wheel. The bumps in the road amplified, I had consecutive but sporadic airtime. The wipers spit rain and mud to either side. I glanced in the rearview. 

The child was galloping on all fours. Unbothered by the speed, by the mud, by the rain. The thing persisted. Its appendages moving with such fervor, its head pointed to the ground, it followed. It was gaining on me. 

I passed the skeletal remains of a deer on 130th ave.

I gripped the steering wheel as tightly as I could when I felt it start to get away from me. I was too late. I hydroplaned and spun out of control. I careened off the muddied road and narrowly missed a pine as I sailed off into a field. As I involuntarily did donuts in the clearing my brakes had finally pushed my car to a complete stop.

The pitter-patter drone of rainfall atop the car was the only thing I heard as my wrist vibrated informing me I had just been in an accident. I couldn't find my phone anywhere in the car. Fire ran down my neck, following my spine and distributing itself through my body and out my digits. In my rattled state I struggled to get my bearings, to focus on anything other than the contents of my stomach. I cut the engine, ""I'm gonna stay here a short while."" 

I sat there and worked the tension out of my hands. Breathe in, breathe out. I leaned back my head, placing my crown squarely on the headrest. Warm iron-tasting liquid had begun to seep from my tongue forming a small pool situated along my bottom row of teeth. 

*""Plink""*

*""Plink, plink.""*

*""Plink, plink, plink.""*

I jammed my thumb into the steering wheel as I sloppily and frantically reached for the ignition.

*""Click-click-click.""*

I pumped the stiff brake pedal and forced the key clockwise.

*""Click-click-click""*

Again.

*""Click-click-click""*

*""Plink""*

That one landed in the direct center of my windshield. As I shot my eyes up it darted out of my periphery. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, and now I could hear footsteps scampering about the car.

*""Wham!""* It charged my passenger door. A deafening cacophony of thuds as it scaled my sunroof. The child leaped to the hood and stared directly at me.

""What the fuck is that-"" The words jumbled and twisted out of my mouth.

The child's grizzled brown fur was made slick by the rain and light of the moon. Its beady black eyes darted from me to the contents of my car and back to me. His little chest rising and falling as its cleft 4 fingered hands explored my windshield. It pressed its snout against the glass, grey and green plasma bubbling from its two gaping nostrils. 

I laid on my horn. Furiously beating the steering wheel and beeping in rapid protest.

It squealed. Frightened and angered by the noise it hopped and dug its tusk into my windshield before flailing and launching itself back into the dark. Scampering on all fours into the inky blackness of night. My windshield fractured, and I attempted to start the car again. My headlights flickered revealing the feral thing just ahead. The engine sputtered, struggling to start.

Guttural grunts and high-pitched whines filled the treeline. Every direction was engrossed by the war cry of wild hogs. 

Their squeals pierced my eardrums as a veritable tribe of bipedal swine emerged from the thicket. Of all sizes, some hairy, some nude, brown and black fur, tusks of varying lengths. Soulless eyes peered at my solitary island of machinery. They stumbled ahead, snorting and squealing as they closed the distance.

The hog people made their approach and I flooded my engine. 

""C'mon c'mon. Work damn it!"" I violently shook the steering wheel and beat a fist on my dashboard. ""Please! For the love of God!"" I shouted as one of the pigs snarled and charged the driver's side door.

The car lazily chugged to life and my dash illuminated. I pumped the accelerator and failed to budge as the first two hogs made contact with my car. 

One of the feral things hit my car with such force it left a bloodied snout print on my window. It stammered back and reached its 4 fingered hoof hand to the wound. It began to hungrily lap at its own blood.

At this sight, another larger beast stopped inches from the injured hog's face. Its snout twitched, examining the damage. The pig dashed its mighty tusk across the throat of the other and began biting at the hole.

At this, the pigs swarmed the dying creature. They voraciously ripped with their cleft appendages. Gnashing their teeth, and gnawing its sinewy flesh. Blood soaked the faces of the feasters. Squealing with delight as they dined upon one of their own. A dog pile of 15 or more three to four-foot-tall pig people were tearing the carcass clean at my door. Still, my car wouldn't budge.

The grizzly scene before me made it clear there was only one way out. I shot a hand to my glove box gripping a clump of McDonald's napkins. Drawing them close to my face I spat the small amount of blood that had pooled after the accident.  I carefully cracked the window and stuffed the bloody napkins in the crevice. I quickly rolled the window up, suspending my blood there above the frenzy. 

One particularly famished pig, that had been left on the outskirts of the feed, was kept through the crowd. Its snout twitched and it let out a deep and terrifying scream. 

One by one the feral hog men took notice of me. They turned their attention from the bones at their hooves and all pushed to sink their gaping maws onto my own warm flesh. All of their attention and focus, now dedicated to pushing and rocking my car from the driver's side. 

The car teetered and I braced as I was cut free from the mud. The Hyundai's engine roared as we charged from the field back to the main road.

I sailed down the loam and gravel with the hogs in hot pursuit. They galloped on all fours through the mud and blood.

I inched the window down. The blood-soaked napkins fluttered out of my vehicle and floated back behind the hogs. The things all stopped and twirled chasing the napkins. The pack of mutant pig people faded out of view, trading the dim red flood for darkness.

A final bump in the road was my sign I was nearing civilization. I had returned to the county-maintained road. At breakneck speeds I made record time getting back to Golden Gate Parkway. The black asphalt glistened on the freshly watered roadway. A few minutes later I pulled into the Waffle House on exit 101.

Ignoring the dents, the scratches, the fractures, the mud, and the blood; I grabbed my iPad from my guitar case. I scarfed down my eggs and sausage and began to write.

The sun's coming up now and the lady behind the counter has been giving me weird glances ever since I sat down. I don't know if anyone out there will believe what I saw out in the Picayune, but I know I have no reason to return to the blocks in the Golden Gate Estates anytime soon.

Just as I'm about to pay, I swear I see a rock plink against the restaurant window.

1) I go immidiately and get a rabies shot. I really don't like this option.

2) I watch the dog over the next few days and see if it develops any symptons, then go if it does.

So for mothers day, our family is mostly spread out across states, sister in Kentucky, another brother in Tennessee, so they couldn't really get together and do something for my mom, but my brother i feel actively chooses not to do anything, he recently bought a camper trailer, he took himself, my sister in law, and her mother camping over the weekend for mothers day, and didn't and still hasn't done anything for my mom. Not even a card, she was crying the day before because none of her kids did anything, so I decided id do something for her atleast. I woke up early, made her breakfast im talking the works, bacon, eggs, waffles, pancakes, sausage, served it to her in bed with a coffee, but she was still kinda bummed out all day until my brother got home, and I pulled him aside and asked what he was gonna do for our mom for mothers day, to which he shrugged and walked away. Which kind of pissed me off so I called him a dick for not thinking to atleast do the smallest thing to show his appreciation, his mother in law said I had no respect and was out of line, I kinda snapped and said I wasn't talking to her. Long story short we all screamed at each other for like 2 minutes and he's been giving the cold shoulder since, AITA?

May 13, 2025

In what many are calling “the beginning of the end,” a new artificial intelligence system has once again demonstrated its terrifying ability to complete soul-crushing labor that most people weren’t being fairly compensated for in the first place.

The model, unveiled last week by tech conglomerate QuantumSiliconRaymond™, is capable of drafting emails, organizing spreadsheets, and generating customer service responses in a tone indistinguishable from that of a weary intern on their third coffee. Critics argue the technology represents a grave threat to jobs, meaning it may disrupt long-held traditions of waking up at 6:30 a.m. to perform repetitive tasks for 45 hours a week under fluorescent lighting in exchange for access to healthcare.

“This is dangerous,” said one commenter on a popular social media site owned by a billionaire who recently replaced 90% of his workforce with code. “This AI is going to take our jobs and give them to no one.”

Experts warn that the rise of AI could lead to mass unemployment if companies decide to replace workers with machines—something they had already been doing long before machines were good at anything.

“It’s horrifying,” said analyst Jen Watkins, as she reviewed financial reports showing companies using record profits to buy back stock instead of pay staff. “We can’t let artificial intelligence automate away our right to precarious employment.”

Watkins went on to emphasize that the issue was absolutely the technology itself, not the idea that it might be deployed in a system primarily concerned with shareholder returns. “Obviously the real villain here is the machine that can write pithy birthday card poems,” she added.

Meanwhile, some AI ethicists have proposed solutions, such as “AI taxes,” “universal basic income,” or “just maybe questioning why work has to hurt.” These ideas were widely dismissed as impractical by the people in charge of making things practical.

The living room/dining room are open concept and I already have a round coffee table & matching end table (Winona table from West Elm) and am very drawn to round dining tables. I’m concerned, probably unnecessarily so, that having a round coffee table and round dining table in one open space will just be too much…round. The dining space is 8’6” x 9’ so I have this thought that a square table would just take up too much space.

Am I overthinking the roundness? For what it’s worth, my tv stand & couch are very square in shape but I do have a small round footstool. I mostly just want to ensure my rooms are balanced in shape and don’t feel too round and blobby.

1kl8v3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/1kl8v3m/career_advice_for_the_up_n_comersdreamers/,Career advice for the up n comers/dreamers...,"Hey there, my name's FuntCase and i've been a dubstep artist since 2009. I've toured the world, seen many things, felt all possible feelings and basically just experienced life in all forms as a recognised artist. I wanted to give some advice out there to people who are on the rise and people who are dreamers...bedroom DJs if you will.

This kind of information isn't really available to anyone when you start out, only people who have been there can truly give this kind of help and it really isn't something you can ever be prepared for...but i'm gonna try my best to prepare you for what may be.

Lets start with the obvious: The music scene is brutal. Yes, you've heard this a million times and it seems like common information, but what you can never be prepared for is how it actually affects you as an artist. Take some artists or bands that you used to absolutely LOVE, but they came and went just as fast...Why is this?

Well lets start with some defining factors:

\- Major labels: When you sign to a Major Label, they have extremely specific demands (usually contractual) that require you to sign to them, ESPECIALLY if it requires them giving you an advance of money of large sums. If you don't meet the demands and have spent the money...sorry mate, you're locked into that contract either until you pay off the money back, or you end up waiting till the contract has been terminated i.e. mutual consent or there's a grace period of the contract till you're out of it and free, but that can be YEARS. I personally knw of artists who have been given very good deals with a major label, released an album, but then the major didn't like anything after that first album and wouldn't release what they had. This means that they couldn't fulfil their contractual agreement and was locked in a kind of 'limbo' where nothing comes out and they just slowly fade as the scene gets away from them.

\- Keeping up with demand: When you're established in the scene, the whole scene itself becomes one big competition for everyone's attention. Other people may make more digestible music and therefore get more love, other people might do social media better than you and get more engagements\*\*...\*\*and critically, you might not make enough music over the course of the year to keep up with the demands of the people. Mental blocks are REAL and extremely crucial times in your careers and those alone can really put a knock in your charge for success.

\- Mental health/Physical Exhaustion: This one for me isn't talked about nearly enough. We all know touring sounds AMAZING but realistically, it's a hell of a lot of 'lonely time'. What's a typical tour day you ask? Well lets assume you're a heavily touring artist in the middle of a USA/Canada tour for instance...Typical situations will be as follows: We start with the show...Play the set at 1am-2am (average headliner set in a club or maybe a festival). You hang around backstage with other artists or meet fans etc and don't get back to the hotel at roughly 4am (after hanging at the show for a while then 20-30mins hotel travel time), you finally get into your hotel room and put your stuff down but you need a shower as you're all sweaty from the show, 30 mins later you're in bed at like 4:30am. The show was all exciting and you're still buzzing from it so you lay in bed for 30mins on TikTok scrolling because you just can NOT get to sleep and eventually don't get to sleep till 5am. Your flight is at 11am and it takes 30 mins to get to the airport, so you have to get up at 8:30am to leave for 9am, which is only 3.5 hours sleep. You then sit in an airport waiting for your flight, scrolling social media or whatever, at the gate. You then sit on a 3 hour flight trying to sleep but the chair is upright, it's bright on the plane as someone's left their window open and the sun is directly in your face, everyone is talking loudly, there's a kid directly behind you who's got their iPad blasting peppa pig on or there's a baby that JUST WON'T STOP CRYING AND SCREECHING THE WHOLE FLIGHT...so naturally, you get your phone out once again or laptop...(some can sleep but it's broken sleep on a flight, believe me). After landing at the airport and take another 30min uber to the hotel, you get in your hotel room but you have to leave the hotel in 3 hours for the show and need another shower as you've been sweating on the flight. 2.5 hours till you leave for the venue and you're kinda just doing whatever...some might scroll social media, some might try nap, some might play games on their switch etc...eventually you leave for the club and its rinse and repeat for the however many shows you have per week per month and if you're lucky, for many years.

Realistically, touring is an extremely lonely job as most of the time, 2-3 hours of the day is spent at the club meeting fans and promoters which is amazing but the rest of the day is either fighting for sleep, attempting to be productive making music on your laptop or doing your set on Rekordbox. It's honestly really difficult to be creative when you're running on 3.5 hours sleep and all you've fed your brain is a coffee and a cold sandwich because you couldn't get breakfast due to boarding time constraints and you really didn't feel like Popeyes or Nathan's hot dogs at 9:15am. All of your other waking time is spent alone in airports, Ubers and hotels and as fun as it is at first, it genuinely takes a toll over time.

Why have I posted about this? Well I feel like people deserve to know what they're fighting for, what they dream of, what they will spend every waking hour during their 9-5 to reach that paradise life. Realistically even IF you do make it, are you even gonna make the big bucks? Does money even bandage over the fact that you're lonely?

I really hope this can put into perspective the lifestyle that artists deal with and if you're up to it. This body of text will never fully prepare you for what's coming, if its comes...but I think it will give you insight and maybe even a level of preparation for what you would love to achieve in this life of a brutal music scene.

16 years in the game and counting...

1kl8uzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kl8uzr/mothers_day/,Mother’s Day,"Hi everyone -

First post here. Also not trying to write a biography, just giving the details.

- my daughter turned 6 on Mother’s Day. We had a full blown birthday for her the weekend before complete with kids party and small family party after. 

- on Mother’s Day, I arrived home from work at 7 AM in the morning after an overnight night shift. I walked through the door with flowers for wife, cinnamon buns for wife, and a coffee for her as the kids came tearing down the stairs excited to see dad and the birthday decorations which my wife put out for a second time. 

- I then made breakfast to go along with the cinnamon buns. After, I offered to rub her feet, which Wife decline as she was headed to get ready for 9am church service. Shortly after, she said she didn’t have time to get to the 9am and pushed to 10:30.

- around the second go around of getting ready for church, my 6 year old daughter asked me to stay and play, instead of going to church. I had no issue with it, and to be very frank, I have said I will never force my kids to go to church. We often do go as a family no issue, but I felt today was about both mum and daughter, which put me in a tough spot.

Ultimately, wife was very upset because I said yes to 6 year old not wanting to go on her birthday. Dad becomes the bad guy, and consequently, I tell 6 year old to get dressed and we all head off to church together… in a fantastic mood as you can imagine.

That’s the coles notes, nothing left out. 

AITA? Help.

Cannibalism can't be explained, and they didn't want to explain.

These idiots acted like nothing ever fucking happened. 

I was going to lose it.

Paranoia had taken over like a virus.

Conversations turned into cat and mouse.

Kaz cornered me in the kitchen to scold me for leaving the refrigerator open, and I felt trapped. Like he could smell me. 

He looked normal. Smirk in place, brow raised. Just Kaz.

That was worse. That meant they were good actors. Perfect mimics. Rowan and Immie too.

It was around midnight when I shouldered a backpack and crept downstairs. I opened the door, inhaling the cool night air, then froze at a low chuckle.

Rowan. In his robe, curls messy, eyes dark. For a second I thought he’d drop the act.

He didn’t.

He stepped forward with that grimacing smile, arms folded. I hadn’t forgotten the look he gave me under the full moon. 

Resentment. Hatred. The real him. Now he didn’t bother hiding his disdain.

I stepped back.

He stepped forward.

Closer. Coffee on his breath.

“It’s almost midnight,” he said. “Where are you going?”

“The store,” I said smoothly. “Needed air.”

“At midnight?” He cocked his head.

The door slammed shut.

“Yeah,” I said. “Getting food.”

“Hungry?” He gestured behind him. “Kaz made veggie lasagna.”

“I’m not hungry.”

“Uh-huh. So what are you getting?”

“Candy,” I snapped. “I want candy.”

Rowan hummed. Almost smiled. Too close. Too calm. “Sweet. Get me some? Those gummy snakes slap.” He held out his hand for a high five, eyes flicking to my bag.

He knew.

And he was enjoying it.

His grin widened. “Hurry back, Nin. There are freaks out there. Don’t want you getting hurt.”

A chill shot down my spine. I forced a smile and stepped back.

Every instinct screamed to run.

His coffee breath turned my gut. His movements were off. Jerky, like he might snap.

One step. Then another. I turned. Reached the handle. Opened the door.

He’s coming after me, I thought.

I imagined him grabbing me, pulling me back, teeth grazing my neck. I ran faster. Down the path. The gate creaked. I looked back.

The house glowed in golden light. Door still open.

But Rowan was gone.

Squinting, I saw him on the stairs. Moving slow. Almost defeated.

Something held me there for a second, staring at the house I always saw as a home and the people I saw as family. 

Before I turned and finally catapulted myself into a run. 

It’s not like I could go back to my parents' house.

They live across the state, and it was the middle of the night.

I had a friend from class. Sam. We used to be close, but a while ago he started to distance himself. 

Sam got new friends, and I moved out of my dorms.

I could either turn up at his door and make a fool out of myself, or go back to my cannibal roommates. 

Making a fool out of myself, it was.

Sam lived in a large building with ivy crawling up red-brick. The house was old and crumbling, but cozy. 

The windows were dark, so that wasn’t exactly comforting. 

Sam used to leave the door open so I could slip in whenever I wanted. Seeing it locked made my stomach twist.

Sure, it was midnight. Why *wouldn't* he lock it? 

I was frowning at a decaying dandelion when the door opened, and a pixie redhead stuck her head out. I recognized her automatically. Poppy. Sam’s roomie.

The girl was fully dressed in a leather jacket over jeans and shirt, her collar glistening from the downpour I’d managed to mis.

Half lidded eyes drank me in for a moment like she was in a daze before she seemingly snapped out of it, yanking the door open. 

“Nin?” Poppy’s gaze snapped to my feet. 

“Get inside! Jesus, Nin, your feet!”

I managed a smile, stepping into the hallway. The house was exactly how I remembered it. Homely. Safe.

“Thanks.”

“What do you need Sam for?” Poppy asked, shutting and locking the door.

I shrugged, shivering. I didn’t realize how cold I was until I stepped into warmth. “Just to talk to him! You know, catch up.”

Poppy laughed. “About? You ran across campus to talk?” 

“I’m kind of locked out.”

Poppy’s smile faded. “Ah.” She cleared her throat, stepping aside. 

“Well, you know you’ve always got a home here if you’re ever in trouble.” she gestured over her shoulder. “Sammy is in the lounge.” 

Poppy led me into their kitchen and plonked a can of soda on the table. 

It was just like the old days. Poppy and I would hang in the kitchen drinking while Sam took a millennia to get ready. “You drink that. I'll drag Sam away from his game.” 

I nursed the can between my hands, rolling it around. *”Game?”*

Poppy rolled her eyes, yanking open the refrigerator with a little *too much* gusto and pulling out a beer. She cracked it open and took a sip through a  groan. 

“Urgh. They're in the middle of a tournament, or whatever. It started last night, and it’s still going. You’d think grown adults would do something more interesting with their time, but alas, I digress.” Poppy set the can down. 

“I’ve been trying to sleep for the last few hours, but they’re pretty loud. I just block them out with whatever’s on Netflix.”

Cracking open my soda, I downed half of it. God, there was nothing better than a frosty Coke. 

Rowan and I used down bottles of them for our failed Tik-Tok account. We stopped doing it when he had to get his stomach pumped.

“Tournament?” I said through a mouthful. 

Poppy smirked and perched herself on the edge of the table. 

""Just a nerd game,"" she said dismissively. ""Sam’s friends are quite… odd.""

She grabbed her beer. ""Hey, why don’t we head into the lounge instead, huh? I’m sure Sam wouldn’t mind us interrupting him.""

With a mischievous glint in her eyes, she spun around and grabbed my arm. ""Besides! Sammy’s friends have been here long enough.""

As she pulled me into the lounge, I caught a fleeting glimpse of... something.

I didn’t see much, just enough to know it wasn’t some typical Dungeons and Dragons game.

Papers were strewn across the table. A group of people, including Sam, was gathered around, one of them marking something on the paper.

Sam’s other housemates were conspicuously absent. When Poppy walked in, dragging me along, the group quickly turned to block my view, hurriedly clearing papers and shutting laptops. 

It felt like I’d just walked into something I wasn’t supposed to see. Poppy, however, seemed delighted by their reaction. 

""Oh, Saaaammmyy,"" she sang, leaning against the door with a smile. ""You have a visitor.""

Sam looked different, though I couldn’t put my finger on why. 

His light sandy hair was tied into its usual clumsy ponytail, but the look on his face was one I’d never seen before. 

Flustered, his cartoonishly wide eyes blinking at me like I was a hallucination. 

Like Poppy, he was fully dressed. Sam murmured something to the group, and they quickly gathered stained coffee mugs and bits of paper, clearing the table.

Poppy, now slumped into a beanbag, shot me a grin. ""And then there were three!” 

She stretched out like a cat and squealed when Sam threw a cushion at her. ""We finally have our house back!""

""You know I have the lounge until two,"" he retorted, continuing to tidy up.

Poppy mimicked his voice, her body melting into the beanbag. *""You know I have the lounge until two.""*

""What did I tell you about mimicking me?"" Sam shot her a glare, exasperated.

The girl chuckled. ""Hey, it’s fun.""

""It’s not fun when you sound absolutely nothing like me.”

“Cry about it, Sammy.”

Their back and forth reminded me of my own roommates.

His lip curled into the slightest of smiles, and he picked up another cushion to throw. “Poppy.”

“Sam.” She shot back in a mocking exaggeration of his accent.

Sam’s accent never failed to take me by surprise. Hard Aussie. When I first met him I could barely understand him.

It didn’t help that upon first meeting him, he talked like he’d been fast forwarded.

Originally from Victoria, Sam Fuller was my first friend. 

Poppy folded her arms, her gaze trailing after the group filing out of the room. They were mixed ages, though none of them were Sam’s. 

“Your weird friends can find another meeting place for your games. I want to sleep. Allie and Tom have locked themselves in their rooms since you decided to invite half of the neighborhood.”

“They’re not weird games. We’re saving the town.” Sam shooed Poppy out of the room. “Don’t you have work to do?” 

“Maybe.” Poppy nodded at me. “I’ll make you another drink.” Her gaze fell on Sam. “Beer?”

He grinned. “That’d be great.""

“Awesome!” Poppy playfully hit him. “Get one yourself. You’re a big boy, aren’t cha? I’ll be in my room!”

Ignoring Poppy slamming the door behind her, Sam’s attention flicked to me. “Nin, what are you doing here?”

I couldn’t help it, the words slipping out before I could stop them. “Who were they?”

Sam dragged his hands through his hair. “Just friends.” His expression softened, and the knot in my gut loosened.

“You look like shit, Nin. What happened?”

I figured telling him a diluted version of the night of the full moon was better so I didn’t sound out of my mind.  

By the time I was finished explaining, the two of us were curled up on his bed in front of his laptop playing YouTube videos on low. 

Sam sat in front of me, his arms wrapped around his knees. 

“So, your roomies got you freaked?” He frowned, his sleepy eyes on me. “What did they do?”

Cannibalize my body. I thought dizzily.

No, worse. They weren’t just eating me.

They were replicating me, so they could eat me again, and again, and again, and—

“They were just acting weird.” I said.

“Weird *how*?”

Hours later, when I was falling asleep, and Sam was watching YouTube, he nudged me.

“Nin?”

“Mm?” I mumbled into his pillow.

“Where do you live now? Like, which house?”

“It’s just down the road from here.”

He hummed. “And those roommates…who are they again?”

I didn’t answer him.

A week flew by. 

Classes were more or less the same, but they were a good distraction.

I got texts and missed calls from Immie, and Kaz and Rowan were blowing up the group chat with “?????” messages. 

I muted it and ignored my phone. 

I can’t remember what day it was when I fully came to reality, badly hungover and feeling sick to my stomach.

Class was ending, and as usual, I filed out of the hall, heading to where Sam usually met me before we went to his house. My head was spinning, a striking pain rattling my skull.

I’d suffered from hangover headaches before, but this was something new. Swallowing two Tylenol with the cold coffee I’d had in my backpack all day wasn’t a good idea. 

Luckily, Sam joined me quickly, his smile dampening when he saw my expression. 

“Oh, man.” He felt my forehead. “You look like you’re going to barf everywhere.”

Despite the pain, I managed a smile. “Do I look like a zombie?”

Sam dragged a hand through his hair. “Will you hit me if I say yes?”

I shooed him away when he held up his hand. “How many fingers am I holding up?”

A sudden loud slam pricked my ears.

It didn’t seem to alert the crowd of students, merely a whisper in a room full of loud chatter and laughter. 

To me though, it was a sound I knew all too well. 

Lifting my head, I scanned the crowd enveloping the hallway. 

Sam was speaking behind me, but his voice collapsed into a low buzz of white noise bleeding into my muddled brain. 

I knew that sound. The sound of skin hitting glass, or wood, sometimes plastic. 

There was nobody else it  would be but my chronically clumsy roommate. 

I had zero idea how to confront him about the *cannibalism* thing. 

He wasn't what you'd expect a monster to look like—especially not one you knew had already killed and eaten you multiple times. It was all about perspective. 

To a passerby, he seemed like an ordinary college student, a dishevelled one who had just stumbled headlong into an automatic door, leaving a glaring red bruise in the center of his forehead. 

But to me, Rowan Beck was a monster surrounded by fresh meat. 

The students pushing past him were a blur to me, but to *him*, I caught his gaze drinking each one in, his nose flaring when a guy sauntered past him. 

From a distance, my roommate appeared unchanged, wearing a faded, threadbare t-shirt bearing a logo that had long since peeled away, a pair of well-worn jeans with frayed edges and a patch over one knee.  

So much for his *pretentious phase.* 

The glasses were a *choice*.

His dark brown curls were tousled and unkempt, partially hidden under a baseball cap that looked like it had seen better days. But as he drew nearer, I could see his mask slowly starting to crumble. 

His wide smile faltering, twitching into a grimace. 

His cheeks looked hollow, gaunt even. Like something was sucking the life from him. 

Rowan oozed broke college student who hadn’t showered in days. 

In his hand was a to-go cup of hot cocoa--which was my favorite. 

“Yooo, Nin! Sup!"" Rowan was attracting stares as he sort of danced towards me, tripping over his feet, only for him to steady himself with a grin. 

His words were slurred slightly. 

He wasn’t moon-drunk, I thought.

Actually drunk.

“Hey.” Sam nudged me. I noticed he’d stiffened up. “That's your roommate? Rowan Beck?"" 

I didn’t get a chance to reply, with Rowan situating himself right in front of me, swaying a little.

“Now call me craaaaazy!” My roommate said in a slurred giggle. 

He stumbled again, and this time my hand shot out to steady him on impulse. I caught the flash of disgust on his face. 

Still wearing that smile, he swiped my hand off of his shoulder. 

“But I’m getting the vibe you’re avoiding us! Which is like, sooo rude. You could have just sent us a text, but noooo, you decided to be cool and mys-te-ri-ous.""

I took the drink hesitantly. “Are you drunk?” 

Rowan cocked his head.

“Drunk? You think I can get drunk? Nah man, I just feel kinda shit. He shrugged. “I haven’t been eating great the last few days. Not eating can fuck a guy up. Right Nin?”

Every word penetrated like a knife, and suddenly it was hard to fucking breathe.

My roommate turned to Sam. “Ooh, I know you!"" He spread out his arms, a choked laugh escaping his lips. ""You’re the guy who wrote that fucking article about us!” 

“Loved it, Fuller! You're a literary genius! Especially when you called us ‘evil body snatching demons’ who should be burned at the stake. A truly riveting read.""  

Sam’s expression stayed stoic. “Rowan.” He said my roommate's name like poison. “Where’s Kaz?”

“Playing COD, probably.” Rowan’s lips curled into a smirk. 

He leaned close to the guy, raising an eyebrow, his words more of a breathy laugh. “Why? Do you want me to pass a message to him?”

Sam stepped back. “Nin, I gotta go."" He said, pulling out his phone. “I’ll speak to you later.”

“Right.” I panicked. “Am I still okay to stay?”

“I’m… I’m busy.” Sam nodded at me, ignoring Rowan, before stumbling back into the crowd. “Come by later, all right?”

He was gone before I could open my mouth.

“Aww, noooo. Don't gooooo.” Rowan mocked a pout, turning to me. 

“Damn. Did he seem… offended? By my presence?"" 

He waved Sam away with a grin. ""Anyway! Imogen is making dinner tonight. She’s bought all the ingredients for something she saw on Pinterest, so I’m not holding my breath that it’ll be good—or even edible.” 

I didn’t fight back when he slipped his hand in mine, pulling me down the stairs. 

His tone was already puppeteering my limbs. 

My roommate twisted around, shooting me a sheepish smile. 

“Okayyyy, you got me! I should probably apologize for the other night.”

I was already backing away, pulling away from him.

“I don’t care what you have to say.” I said in a breath. “I’m staying with my parents.”

“You mean halfway across the state?” Rowan’s hand tightened around my arm. ""Come on. We just want to talk.”

“Talk?”

That got my attention. Following him to his car parked out front, I slipped into the passenger seat.

I was aware I was following the big bad wolf into the forest, every horror movie cliché.

But what other choice did I have?

Rowan jumped into the driver's seat and started the car, dragging his hand through his hair. “Yeah.” He said. “I mean, once again we left you on a full moon and I bet it sucked. But hey,” He chuckled. “At least you didn’t see us moon-drunk again.” 

Twisting around to face him, my heart slithered into my throat. The bastard was still playing his games.

“You’re still saying that?” I hissed. “Moon drunk?”

Rowan’s gaze didn’t leave the road. “I mean, yeah.” He murmured, “You said we freak you out, so we keep our distance.”

Rowan didn’t speak for most of the ride, and I spent the majority of it trying to find out how to jump out of a moving car without seriously injuring myself. 

My phone vibrated and I pulled it out, glimpsing a text heading my notifications bar.

Sam: Sent: 4:05PM.

“That thing is NOT Rowan Beck. Get out of that house.”

Another message:

Sam: Sent: 4:06PM: “GET OUT, NIN. GET OUT OF THAT HOUSE.”

Instinctively, I grabbed for the handle, pawing for a way out. 

I felt like I was on fire, my body moving closer to the door, leaning into it, as if it would magically fucking open for me. 

“You okay?” Rowan murmured. He slipped off his raybans and turned to me. 

That same gleam was in his eyes, that sliver of moonlight. 

He looked worse without the raybans, bloodshot eyes, a mixture of burst blood vessels and moonlight haloing his iris. 

My roommate looked beautiful and horrifying at the same time, a mixture of human and inhuman; the shell of the guy I thought I knew filled with her. But there was something else, something I didn’t understand. His skin looked… cracked. 

Like it was splintering apart. 

And in those cracks was what I imagined pins and needles to look like. Static. 

There was static leaking from the cracks, spider webbing across his pasty skin. 

Rowan sighed when I couldn’t bring myself to answer. 

“You know,” he said, his hands tapping the steering wheel. 

""Eating makes me feel better. It... “ He took a long breath, tapping out a tune. “Well, it takes the memories away, you know? Makes me feel so fucking good.” He tipped his head back, eyes rolling back, like he was in euphoria.

“Rowan.” I managed to get out. 

His eyes flickered shut at a red light. “You would not believe how good the human skull tastes when mixed with intestines. Oh my god, the crunch! It's fucking *insane*. Your skin is my favorite part.""

He tapped a beat with his shoe. ""Damn, you taste good. Like chicken! But a little sour.”

When I grabbed for the door handle, one arm whipped out, pinning me to the seat, the other straying on the wheel. 

He was unsurprisingly strong, his heavy weight restraining me against cool leather. 

“The flesh under Kaz’s bed is good. I mean, it’s a little soggy and gross on the outside. It’s not peak meat, but it’s tolerable. If you ask me honestly, I’d say I prefer you refrigerated.” 

His lips split into a grin. “And we’re saving those for a good game of Smash.”

“Rowan.” I heard myself say his name again, straining against his arm.

“You said we should talk.” He deadpanned. 

Outside, the world went by as normal, the evening rush hour flying by in a blur of vivid reds and oranges. “So, that’s what we’re going to do.” He whistled. “Talk.”

Words appeared in my throat, but they wouldn’t form on my tongue. 

He surprised me with a laugh. And with that laugh, his façade was shattered. 

He’d finally ripped off his mask. “Why did you have to come downstairs?” 

Rowan finally twisted to me, his lips curled into a grin, his eyes telling a different story. So many emotions. Past emotions. 

Emotions from a time ripped from my memory. Hatred and pain, anger and something else entirely I couldn’t read. 

“All you had to do was stay in your fucking room, and we wouldn’t have to… have to remember. We could go on living together.”

I was frozen. I couldn’t fucking move. Rowan grabbed the wheel with both hands, his knuckles turning white. 

He’d let me go, but I couldn’t bring myself to move. Not when he’d said that. 

Not when his words had stirred something in me. Still though, he kept speaking—like him—the real him—had been silenced for so long, and here he was, letting it all out. 

“She takes all the bad away,” he whispered, a dreamy smile spreading across his lips. “As long as we eat, I don’t feel anything at all. I don’t have to fucking think or breathe, and I can look at you with rose-tinted glasses and a foggy brain. It’s fucking bliss. Like I’m….drowning.” Rowan sighed, dragging his hand through his hair. 

“Not now,” he said. “Now, she’s punishing me because I haven’t eaten.”

The car swerved around a truck, and I fought against my own body, fighting to grab the wheel. But I was frozen. 

“Now, I remember.” His tone was poison spitting from his tongue. 

“She made us remember, and it’s… it’s fucking there in my head,” His voice strained, and he stabbed at his left temple. “Right here! It’s right fucking here, Nin, and I can’t… I can’t stop it. I can’t stop her. She’s in my... my head.”

Rowan didn’t look at me. In fact, he was actively avoiding making eye contact.

Tears were welling in his eyes, hysterical tears leaking that same buzzing black and white static. “She’s in my head. Always in my head. Singing, man. Singing at the top of her voice.”

“What did I do?” I didn’t mean to say it. 

The car swerved again, and I braced myself against the seat. “Rowan, you keep telling me I did something.” I managed. “Why can’t you tell me?”

My roommate turned to me, his eyes filled with that unearthly light I knew he’d been trying to avoid for months.

His smile was suddenly maniacal. Not his. Someone else's. “Because it’s fun!”

This time I did grab for the wheel, trying to shove him from his seat. “Stop the fucking car.”

Rowan easily got the upper hand, grasping it. “No. Like I said, we’re going home. And.. and we’re going to talk.”

It was me who laughed this time. “Talk?” I spluttered. “You mean eat me. Copy me. Whatever you do.”

I couldn’t control my emotions. I laughed. It felt good. ""You suck at being a serial killer."" 

I managed to take him off guard for a moment. He blinked before regaining control. “It’s not… like that. Jesus fucking Christ.”

""Then what is it?” I spat back, days of repressed emotions rushing to the surface. 

“I catch you eating me, and what am I supposed to think? Are you trying to shield me?” 

I was laughing, and I couldn’t stop. 

And at that moment I realized we were both under her spell. Both of us were screaming at each other. 

Rowan, leaking her light, and me, bathing in it. 

It hit me, then, that I was as inhuman as him. 

Whatever the moon had done, it was affecting both of us. 

I just didn’t have the cannibalistic tendencies he had. 

“I caught you chewing on what I presume was my *twenty sixth* body! What the fuck do you think you can shield me from?” 

Rowan surprised me with a scoff. “I’m sorry, *shield* you?” 

He turned to me fully, and I realized, my stomach creeping into my throat, that he wasn’t looking at the road. 

“Are you fucking *kidding* me?” My roommate choked out. “I want you to remember!” He yelled. “You think I *want* to play happy families with you?” Rowan was cracking. 

I wasn't sure if that was good or bad. 

I noticed him inching away from me. 

“That's why I *eat*, Nin. That’s why we eat. She numbs those feelings. Those thoughts. She only makes us think about the good.”

When his hands slammed into the steering wheel, I finally caught a sliver of humanity coming back to fruition on his face.

My hand slipped from the handle, and I heard myself speak. “What did I *do*?”

But Rowan’s eyes were on the road again. He squinted, and reality seeped in. “What the fuck is *that*?”

No longer on the main road, we were heading into darkness, an empty stretch of oblivion I didn’t recognise. There were no signs of cars. I swallowed. “What did you see?""

Rowan shook his head, blinking rapidly. “Nothing.” He said. “I think I’m… seeing things—”

Whatever Rowan was about to say was cut off suddenly, followed by a blinding flash which felt and sounded like the world had been ripped apart in front of us.

Something was there, blinding me, searing my eyes from my skull. 

But I had no time to scream, no time to think or breathe. 

Before I could, my mind was working, and dizzying thoughts were hitting me. 

Our car had hit something, and that something was powerful enough to propel me into the air, my roommate's car shredded apart. The world was shattering around me, my body caught in a whirlwind. 

The sensations were too real, too real to be feeling them. 

I wasn’t supposed to feel this. 

I wasn’t supposed to feel my body being ripped apart, and still be self-aware enough to screech into nothing, a nothing which existed when my head had been ripped from my torso. I wasn't supposed to– 

Exist. 

I waited to die. 

Without a brain, without a body, I waited for the dark. And yet somehow, I didn’t fall fully. Instead of plunging into the dark, my body was still mine. It still had a head.

A torso.

It was still mine when it hit something with a sickening crack.

Concrete.

Dying kind of feels like melting. 

I was aware my eyes were snapping open for a moment, something wet and warm spreading around me and trickling from my lips. 

I could taste rust, and I couldn't stop it. My vision was blurry, too blurry to make sense of anything. I watched my eyelids flickering, like they were unsure what to do.

The sky was pretty. I think I tried to name a star, before everything just kind of… melted. 

It was the 28th time I’d died, and this was the first time I really felt it. 

Melting. 

I melted into the ground, my body and thoughts fragmenting. 

Before whatever had taken me choked me back out. 

Death had rejected me. 

After a disorienting moment of *nothing*, trapped between nothing and something, awareness came back to me in splinters, reality bleeding back into focus. I could feel the breeze tickling my back. 

I had…moved.

I was no longer where I’d landed on my back after being propelled from the car in the crash.

Now I was lying on my stomach. 

Something tickled my face. 

Grass. 

I was lying face down on the side of the road.  

I can’t describe the sensation it was to awaken only being part real. 

When I sat up, I felt real. 

I felt like I was part of this universe. 

But looking down at myself, I resembled a ghost, both see-through and not. Prodding at my skin, that same static bleeding from Rowan’s face worked effortlessly, carving my outline and stitching me back together. 

My body was a brand new copy of the me before the crash. 

I even saw the coffee stain on my shirt. The smear of pen I’d drawn on the back of my hand when I was bored in class.

I felt nothing. Like I was made of stars. 

Hollow.

Something was missing, though, a cavern in my mind beginning its purge.

Do you know when you wake up from a dream, and it slips away as you regain consciousness?

That’s what it felt like. Like everything which had happened, the crash, everything Rowan said—was a dream.

Once I felt more like myself, and when my fingertips could touch real objects, wet gravel and grass, my own skin, I shakily got to my feet. I found my old body at the side of the road. I’d bled out, just like I thought. My eyes were still wide open, still struggling to name that constellation. 

When I crawled over to it, I couldn’t resist, grasping hold of her hand, only to get a flash. Like I was seeing her POV. 

She was my old body’s memories. I saw Rowan’s expression, his skin splintering apart, his eyes filled with moonlight. 

I saw him struggling with the wheel, and then the crash. Letting go of her ice-cold hand, I let out a sharp breath, her memories flashing out of existence. 

I didn’t have time to think about what I’d seen—about the questions piling in my skull, taking over my thoughts. 

Rowan was still in the car, his body twisted like a pretzel, my roommate’s head smashed against the wheel spattered with gore, his brain leaking from his ears. 

“Rowan.”

I stopped shaking him when I realized his spine had snapped, his body more liquid than solid. 

When I felt for a pulse, it was still there, but faint, as sharp red pooled around him, sticking to his hair and drenching his skin and clothes. 

His head lolled to the side, and I saw and *felt* that final breath escape his lips. 

When I crawled out of the wreck of his car, I dropped onto my knees. 

There it was again. 

This time it was louder, completely unmistakable. The sound of a photograph being taken.

When that light filled my eyes once again, I turned away from the car wreck, blinking through intense light. 

It was at the back-end of that sound, the sound of a photo snapping reality and stealing away a moment, when I glimpsed the body seemingly bleeding into existence right in front of me. 

Like a polaroid coming to life. 

Stumbling over to him, I found Rowan curled into himself, and like me, he was made up of static, which became flesh, which became skin, spreading across him, making a perfect copy, an exact replica of the dead guy in the wreck. 

He was beautiful, like a shadow coming to life, a sketch bleeding into a human. 

Hesitantly, I reached out and brushed dark curls out of the way, hair which was still shadows and shapes seeping into  contorted reality. 

This time the number 3 was carved into his skin—and by the look of it, the number was fresh, only just coming into existence. 

Did my asshole roommate just *respawn*? 

After a moment of just… watching him, watching my roommate be brought to life, his chest rising and falling, eyelids flickering, lips parting, I got a hold of myself and tried to grab him. 

But when I was sure my hands had made contact with him, flesh with flesh, something smashed into the back of my head, and stars filled my vision. 

I hit the ground, barely physical. Which made me easier to capture. 

I was being dragged, my bare arms burning across rough concrete, before a shadow was looming over me, something cold suffocating my nose and mouth. 

In the corner of my eye, I glimpsed an adult figure lifting  Rowan into their arms, his body still flickering in and out of existence. 

Before I could cry out, I was forced to inhale, choking on what smelled like lemons.

I recently upgraded my coffee station to include the breville smart grinder pro. In the past I have been using pre ground espresso with my smeg espresso machine, but I wanted to get local beans and learn to grind myself. I’m having such a hard time tho!

At first the beans were not even coming out of the grinder, but after some searching I changed the inner burr setting to 8 (coarser) and set the outer burr to 18 and made the espresso time for 30 seconds. Unfortunately this only gets 7-8 g of espresso still, but I was thinking maybe the machine needs to be broken in a little.

After transferring my new grounds to my portafilter, my machine has just stopped working! Water pools at the top of the puck and won’t leave, and the system over pressurizes and auto shuts off, without a single drop of espresso. I have tried decreasing and increasing the amount of espresso (when I was using pre ground beans or using a hand grinder 14 g always worked), turning the outer burr to finer or more coarse, tamping less, and nothing! I am so frustrated that I spent all this money on a new grinder and now it seems my smeg machine won’t work.

*\*not you*

So after watching RT content since 2005, I finally pulled the plug and planned a vacation with my wife to spend a week exploring all of the sights of Austin that I have heard about for 20 years. With the trusty map saved to my phone and nary a firm schedule to be seen (turns out we should have had at least a little plan...) , we set off on our adventure. And as I'm not exactly one for prose, here is a breakdown of everything we did by day:

Saturday: Meanwhile Brewing, Lake Travis Zipline Adventure

Sunday: Desnudo and Kerlaces on Webberville Rd., Bike and Brews ATX with stops at Zilker Brewing, Blue Owl Brewing, Lazarus Brewing Co., and Home Slice on Congress

Monday: Radio East and Veracruz, McKinney State Park, Ani's Day and Night, Peter Pan mini golf, St. Elmo Brewing, Spokesman coffee, Live Oak brewing, Dan's Hamburgers on Airport, and the Congress St bats.

Tuesday: Brew and Brew, Predernales Falls State Park, Turcotte Butcher & Deli, Acopon Brewing Co., Mazama Coffee, Jester King Brewery, BookPeople and CoffeePeople, ATX sign, Waterloo Records, Torchy's on Congress (yes we ended up on Congress three days in a row!).

*\[This is where we should have planned slightly better, as half of the things we were looking at west of Austin were closed on Tuesday, but we ended up making the best of it. And with the construction going on with 290, there was no way in hell we were heading back out that way.\]*

Wednesday: Batch Craft Kolaches, Austin Studios, Breakaway Records, Bookwoman, Barrett's 'on' N Lamar, Alamo Drafthouse Mueller (Minecraft), a lap of Mueller Lake Park, Sign Bar, Hold Out Brewing, Mort Subite Belgian beer bar.

Thursday: The Hideout Coffee House, Barton Creek Greenbelt Trail, Pinthouse Brewing, Gati Ice Cream (& coffee), Terry Black's, Zilker Brewing for a nightcap.

Friday: Fleet Coffee and Veracruz again on Webberville, Nomadic Beerworks, Summer Moon Coffee, and last but certainly not least, In-N-Out.

Suffice it to say we did over 50 unique stops and I still feel like we barely scratched the surface of what Austin has to offer. Who knows, in another 20 years we might head back for a second trip and can then comment on how everything is different, just like the guys do!",4,1747095886.0,GoodMorningGustavo,1,1.0,False

But what else can I do besides hold my head up high and swallow my pride. A bit ago during therapy I reframed my thinking of other people as cockroaches, in that they're more afraid of me than I am of them, so maybe that's why no one reaches out.

So I take the leap and be the first to initiate. If no one's gonna do it it may as well be me, right? And it works for a bit, I suppose. I ask one potential friend to see a movie, and we go. Or I invite another to my birthday, and they come, and its nice and pleasant.

But those were months ago! Not one time since has any of these people hit me up with an ""Hey \*\*\*\*\*, I'm going to a party, you wanna come?"" or ""\*\*\*\*\*, how have you been? Care to meet up for coffee?"" NOTHING. Its been months of complete radio silence. I feel like such a pathetic loser. ApparentlyI can't do a single thing right, even when I follow all the rules and decide to be the bold one. 

Am I truly such a freak of a human that I deserve to get pumped and dumped like this? Was I just set up from years of being put through the ringer to be a background character in other peoples lives? I swear I'm becoming much more of a hateful person because of this. I hate the world, I hate people, I hate my mom and dad. I hate my friends. Nowadays I'm taking this ""neglect"" so to speak as an active form of disrespect from people, like I'm somehow not even worth their time.

She and I were the first friends we made and were close and lived together for the first few years, but then I studied abroad and we’ve lived in different countries for 8 years since. We’ve kept in touch pretty well and have met each other’s partners a handful of times. Despite not being the closest friends anymore I have always considered her a part of life’s big milestones so far.

Last year I had my own wedding (back in the country where we first met and she still lives). She was invited along with her fiancé. We also invited them to stay onsite (one of only 20 other couples we had capacity to offer this to) so they could also join for brunch the following morning with a smaller group of guests and family. They accepted all of these invitations and participated wholeheartedly. Her fiancé also connected with a high-profile business guest at our wedding, and proactively followed up after the fact (think linkedin connection and a follow up in-person coffee). Although said guest did mention it to me afterwards as perhaps a little forward I just put it down to him being friendly. All was seemingly fine.

However, their wedding invite came through about a month ago. Notably only I was on the invite, and not my husband. When I checked (since the invite had no names on it so wasn’t clear) she responded with “sorry it’s nothing against [your husband] but my parent’s friends took up too much of the guest list.” 

Based on the above and how close together our weddings are, I would have expected them to not have participated to such an extent at our wedding if they had no plans to even invite my husband in return. Also I still live abroad - so to travel internationally to attend a wedding completely solo feels like she just wants me to decline outright. 

So now I’m faced with a choice - do I travel half way across the world on my own to attend her wedding out of respect for our friendship over the 10+ years we’ve known each other? Or do I acknowledge the hurt I feel by talking to her about it, or do I just politely decline (without guilt tripping her) and be done with it. If I don’t go, I know that it will mark a change in our relationship for good, but I can’t help but feel surprised by this treatment based on how we treated them as guests (and how they just accepted it all) less than a year ago.

“Oh look, it’s a gunship that wants to be your apartment, your partner, and your alibi all at once.”

Brought to BountyCon 2330 by **Volker Morrow** himself, the **M-39 Privateer** is what happens when someone says:  
“I want a bounty hunter ship, but also somewhere to microwave soup.”

It’s not a ship, it’s a lifestyle. One that involves EMP suppression, prisoner welfare legislation, and the sacred right to recline while watching *Guns of Gravity* reruns between contracts.

Sure, it’s got quad-brig beds to comply with the Interplanetary Prisoner Rights Accord. Sure, it has a personal kitchen next to the cockpit. But let’s not pretend this thing isn’t one hardpoint shy of being a mobile war crime with throw pillows. The *M-39* brags about modular weaponry, forward sensors, low-EM engine shielding... and also about having a loft bed for one with a flatscreen and a snack drawer.

You don’t just pilot the *Privateer*. You *live in it*. You *journal in it*. You write manifestos in it between EMP volleys and thermal boarding actions.

Is it good? Unfortunately, yes.  
Is it excessive? Obviously.  
Is it going to be bought by every mid-tier bounty hunter trying to prove something? Absolutely.  
Will it outlive you? That depends how many snacks you stored next to the suppressor rack.  
In reality? It’s a weaponized bachelor pad.

And here’s what the peanut gallery’s saying:

Here’s what the event floor, and the *very concerned regulatory committee*, are saying:

**— Cydonia Contract Office**  
*“Quad-brig says lawful good. Tri-weapon array says absolutely not.”*

— **The Well – Freelancers’ Lounge**  
*“Kitchenette’s in the cockpit. Because when you live in violence, you snack accordingly.”*

— **NeonNet Legal Watch**  
*“Prisoner rights compliance so airtight, it’s suspicious.”*

— **Customs Quote Board, New Atlantis***“Not sure if it’s a gunship or a tiny home with anger issues. Either way, I want one.”*

***— Outer Rim Hospitality Guild, Dark Grid Uplink***  
*""Do the dishes come standard, or is that a stretch goal?""*

— **Gossip from Bay 12**  
*“Four brig beds, one bunk by the cockpit, and a TV. This isn’t a bounty ship. It’s a divorce recovery vessel.”*

***— Gagarin Landing Lounge***  
*“Honestly? I’d surrender just for the interior tour.”*

***— Chinvat Line Scanner Intercept, Redacted Sector***  
*""Seen it jump systems like it was skipping stones. Silent, fast, and grumpy.”*

**The** ***M-39*** **doesn’t ask questions. It ends them. Preferably while brewing coffee.**

I have this colleague that encourage us to eat left overs let say you baked many croissant and 1-2 left after packing everything he d encourage you to eat it or give it to him to eat. Or he s done using fruit on a cake he d give away the leftover 1-2 strawberries or few blueberries or whatever fruit.

Usually \*real\* bakeries would allow for a bread or to have lunch or coffee or a croissant on them. The grocery store does NOT  though after a few weeks I saw flyers  showing that eating the food is theft.

Now that employee is wasteful to a maximum like taking a whole bowl of frosting dying it a color when a quarter would have been more then enough and if the cake requires 4 colors he s wasting frosting that could have done 4-5 cakes on one. especially on our custom cakes. He then proceeds to wash the frosting away instead of putting it in a safe container to use for the next cake within a  reasonable timeframe. He also does not follow store policy over pricing cakes and undercharges the clients he likes.

That employee is also always watching what people are eating and asking for a bite. I come from a  culture where sharing is caring not sharing is seen as greedy and rude ,  but the food I share is the one I paid from my pocket ( when I want to have thing I baked in the store I buy it , they do not offer a discount for new employees you have to be there for a while to get the discount)... So I really never minded sharing but that person it is every freaken time everyone

I realized he shares the company food as IF he s a generous being while scavenging people food. The store offers company meal from time to time to all staff so its not like he needs to come ask for my or anyone food specifically. At first i thought maybe he s going through some thing financially but he seems to be fully entitled to people and the company stuff. It is disturbing to watch. I have grown to ressent him. He s loved by everyone bt I am starting to see underneath the mask ad i want to say something to him but he s like such a manipulator with words.

Last time i bought a tiny ice cream on sale for a snack as did not want to splurge on a full meal and he came and made a scene while passing it as a jke of why i did not offer him any and how of a amazing quality that ice cream looked. everyone in that break room was looking at me and laughing with him as if that was the greatest joke of all time. it made me so uncomfortable. Like litterally it was 3 dollars i am barely making ends meet. I cracked under pressure and offered him a bite and he refused.  want to punch his entitled face so much. he s like in his 40s and I have no idea what I can do to set a boudary and keep face with his scheme. I am considering bringing in cold lunch and eating in my car to avoid him.

1kl88pv,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1kl88pv/emotional_rollercoaster/,Emotional rollercoaster,"After my previous long term relationship came to an end, at the end of 2023, I’ve had very limited success in the dating world. A few dates here and there but nothing that ever amounted to anything serious. Unfortunately I did not find any real connection with these dates either.

I started speaking with a girl on tinder, and we hit it off right away. We arranged to meet for a coffee, and again continued to get along verrrrry well. We finished our coffee’s and went for a long walk. We were flirting the whole time, holding hands, kissing etc…

I then invited her back to my flat and we slept together, again everything felt just “right” and we seemed to be compatible. She stayed over late and we cuddled and chatted away happily. It felt like we had known each other for a longer time than we had. 

She told me that she really liked me and that she wanted to see me again, which I obviously appreciated, and told her the feeling was mutual.

She went home and we continued to talk over text, arranging to meet up the following day to go to the cinema. She said she couldn’t wait to see me again. 

The next day we met up at the cinema, watched a movie, I held her hand at points, she drew little circles on my hands with her finger tips. We left the cinema, we kissed, and she agreed to come back to my place where we slept with each other again. The chemistry was amazing and we both had a great time.

Afterwards we made plans to meet up the following weekend and she sounded excited about it. 

The following day I sent a message in the morning wishing her an easy day at work. That night she sent a message essentially saying that she wasn’t ready for a relationship and maybe never would be.

I’ve read back through our conversations and there was no hint that she wasn’t interested in me. The whole (admittedly short) time we were together, I really believed she was interested in me.

Now I feel like an absolute idiot and I am crushed. I don’t know why I let my guard down so easily with this girl, but it just felt like we had clicked.

I woke up thinking about how we could go to dinner the next time we saw each other. I’m now going to bed confused by how someone can make a complete 180 degree turn in a day.

God I feel so stupid!

So I have PCOS. I also had menorrhagia, specifically the kind where I basically bled nonstop for years straight.

I’m 27. Big fucking whoop. I woke up with the same headache I’ve had all week, went to stab myself with the MS drug that may or may not be doing anything, and realized my fingertips on my right hand are just gone. Not in a dramatic way - just numb. Dead. Like someone turned off the power. Can’t grip right, can’t feel pressure, can’t even tell when I’m holding something until I drop it. The whole hand feels wrong now. Weak, disconnected, like it doesn’t belong to me. It’s not just annoying - it’s disturbing.

It used to just be my thumb and pointer. Annoying, but manageable. Now it’s every finger. Holding a pen? Drops straight out of my hand. Brushing my teeth? I’ve stabbed myself in the face more than once. Picking up anything takes four to seven tries on average. It’s not just weak - it’s uncooperative. Like my hand’s doing it on purpose. Dropping things constantly. Just straight-up refusing to function. It’s not funny. It’s fucking exhausting. It's dropping things for sport. Actively disrespectful behavior from a limb.

When it was still just the two fingers, I went to a hand specialist. They ordered a nerve conduction study - basically they strap electrodes to you and shock the shit out of your nerves to see if they’re still alive. Then the EMG, which is somehow worse. They stab needles into your muscles and make you flex while they “listen” to the signals. The whole time, I’m twitching on the table while the tech keeps going, “Hmm,” like he’s watching a weather report and not actively electrocuting me. No real feedback, no answers - just vibes and needles. It felt like being tested for something no one knows how to treat anyway.

It’s not carpal tunnel. It’s coming from my cervical spine. Fucking phenomenal. Just the escalation I needed. The hand specialist looked at my nerve study for maybe twelve seconds before hitting eject. Said, “This is outside my scope,” like I’m a goddamn tech support ticket she couldn’t close fast enough. And to make it even worse, she made me come in for a full-blown appointment just to tell me that. Like—cool, thanks for wasting my time, my gas, and charging me a fat copay so you could hand me a referral I could’ve gotten over the phone like a normal human being. Ever heard of MyChart? No? Just needed the billable hour, I guess.

Now I’m being punted to a spine specialist, and neuro’s circling the MS drain again. But it doesn’t feel like the rest of my MS numbness. I wake up with with most of the feeling, and it just drains out of me. The more I move, the more I lose. Pick up a mug? Gone. Button a shirt? Too bad. I’m bleeding motor control and everyone’s acting like it’s just another Monday.

Also, last year’s MRI said “no structural abnormalities JUST lesions,” which is fucking hilarious. My nervous system is glitching in real time, and the scan comes back like everything’s fine outside the MS damage. Like I’m making it up. Like I’m not actively losing function and watching it happen in slow motion. Like I can't tell the difference between my MS and something else going on. (Maybe I can't?? LOL)

And THEN - because apparently I hate myself - I drank coffee and Miralax this morning. Just raw-dogged my digestive tract. Immediate mistake. Instant regret. My booty’s been screaming in italics ever since. My colon is retaliating.

On top of that, every time I try to sleep, my whole body starts vibrating. Not the usual foot-and-leg MS buzz—I know that feeling. This is different. It’s deeper, wired in, like my bones are running electricity. I can’t fall asleep. I can’t stay asleep. I just lie there overheating and twitching while my nervous system does whatever the hell it wants.

Maybe it’s from the caffeine. I usually drink decaf, but lately I’ve been hitting blonde roast because this stupid little French bakery near me has the best coffee I’ve ever tasted in my life. Like genuinely life-changing, flaky-pastry-and-silky-espresso level good. And I keep thinking, “How bad could it be?” Then I’m lying in bed trying to nap, vibrating, sweating, absolutely not dealing. Fully wrecked. Worth it, but not really. But yes. But also no. Full of regret and croissant crumbs.

Also, I go back to work Saturday and I’m already dreading it. I need the paycheck. I need the health insurance. That’s the only reason I’m still there. The job itself is fake-chill hell - everyone acts laid back while I’m doing everything, picking up all the slack, and somehow I’m the one who gets side-eyed for being tired. No backup. No credit. Just constant pressure to hold shit together with one dead hand and a fried brain. I’d quit if I could. I can’t. You know how it is.

Bonus family tangle, because of course:

My mom was going to come spend the weekend with me - birthday, second dose, Mother’s Day. But she didn’t. My sister had a softball tournament on Saturday, about an hour from where I live. They’re heading to state on Wednesday. Mom went to the game, then just… didn’t come here after. Not because she couldn’t. She just didn’t.

I could’ve gone too, in theory. But it was 90 degrees and I would’ve been wrecked. I overheat like a broken fan with MS, and now I’m on Kesimpta, trying to figure out if my immune system even works. I used to get sick constantly. So no - I wasn’t about to roll up to a crowded field and melt in public just to prove something. I did that the day before I started Kesimpta at the softball tournament the weekend before. So I stayed home. And she went back home.

Then she texts me yesterday afternoon: “I should have just come there. No one here even cares that it's Mother's Day. You always make me feel special.”
And now I feel guilty for being hurt. Because I’m the one who’s supposed to get it. Who doesn’t complain. Who holds space for everyone else and doesn’t ask for much in return. Even when I need to. 

She’s been sending me Zillow listings near me since then, talking about buying a house out here so she can visit more. Honestly? Best case scenario. The way I’m living now makes it hard for her to stay - between my boyfriend and I + two weed-scented man-children roommates, a house that smells like stress and leftovers, no space to actually relax. She wants to come. She tries. Every time she visits I bleach the place like I’m erasing a crime scene and she still ends up in a hotel or at my Aunt Susan's 30 miles away in the middle of nowhere which makes it hard on both of us. But my dad’s not on board with a second house, so it’s just… stuck. Like everything else.

And what really gets me? She puts in all this effort to show up for them - for my dad, for my sister. Drives herself, or rides the bus, just to be there for these games. And it’s not easy on her. These trips are hard. They cost her. And they can’t even bother to make her breakfast on Mother’s Day? Not a card. Not even a decent “thank you.” She gets there on her own and they act like it’s just expected. Meanwhile, I’m over here doing everything I can to show up for her - and I’m the one who got left behind this time. But she has MS too, so I do get it, and I don't blame her, and she has been on the go for weeks, but it still sucks.

Aunt Susan’s great, for the record. No drama. Just chicken tortilla soup and clean guest towels that actually smell clean. A rare luxury.

Also haven’t been visiting home much for years because my hometown feels like being waterboarded by beige nostalgia. Same people. Same stories. Same high school failures. grip. Everyone remembers who you were, not who you’ve become, and I’ve had enough of being seen through high school-tinted glasses. Every visit feels like walking into a version of me I worked hard to leave behind. Hard no.

But the guilt eats me alive. I know she wants me to come around more. I know she needs it. That’s why I’ve been trying - pushing myself to make the effort. Go see them. Be present. Be a good daughter. But it’s not that simple. That area carries things for me. Things I don’t always have the energy to carry. Being back there drags all my shit to the surface - old trauma, old patterns, things I’ve spent years trying to move past. And suddenly I’m not just visiting - I’m unraveling.

So yeah. I’ve stayed away up until this last year. Not because I don’t care. Because I care so much it tears me up. And because going back means picking at scars I’ve been trying like hell to let heal.

And it’s my birthday today. The only person who’s actually called me is my dad. My mom made a Facebook post. My uncle sent a text. That’s it. Nothing from my younger sister. Nothing from my older sister. Just… silence. I’m sitting here alone, with a dead hand, a buzzing body, and no plan for the day except trying not to fall apart—physically or otherwise. No one’s showing up. No one’s asking how I am. It’s like I don’t even exist unless I’m making the effort. And today? I don’t have it in me.

Anyway. I’m 27. My hand’s dead weight. My brain’s mush. My guts are rioting. And every night my body buzzes like it’s trying to electrocute itself from the inside out. I can’t rest. I can’t think. I can barely hold a fucking fork some days. MS is a scam. Kesimpta feels like corporate bloodletting disguised as progress. And my nervous system is holding a grudge like I murdered its dog.

If you’ve got symptoms no one can explain - or you’ve had a doctor stab you with needles and call it diagnostics - pull up a chair. We’re all just out here trying to survive in bodies that don’t want us. Come rot with me. No silver linings, no “stay strong” bullshit.

late.

However Ryan is a bit more of a crazy gay and he wanted to go out to drink and so I wasn’t in such a big mood for that I suggested that we should go to my place for drinks since I did have a bunch at home. 
So everything was going fine at first Ryan my bf and I were having wine and talking however Ryan wanted to drink stronger alcohol and so I was like sure why not, we ended up being really drunk and since Ryan likes to go crazy suggested we skinny dipped in my pool (mind you it’s almost winter where I’m from) so I was like fuck it sure we all did that it was fun we then got in, heated up and started dancing and drinking more and well I ended up getting sick and puked and my bf took care of me, took me to bed and he said he’ll make sure to turn off everything and keep everything under control. 

So Ryan and my bf are downstairs and I basically passed out in my bed and well what I didn’t know was that Ryan started being really flirty with my bf and started dancing really close to him and tried to kiss him (clearly a shitty ass friend) and well my bf was really uncomfortable and pushed him away (mind you Ryan is also staying over at my place something I didn’t want to do but since he lives far I accepted) and well Ryan started saying some things to my bf that triggered him and made him overthink a lot and I found out about this the next day when I felt my bf being a bit off (he didn’t tell me much because he didn’t want me to start a fight with Ryan) and well when I confronted Ryan about what happened while I passed out, he told me everything that happened and apologized but I just decided to cut him off because a real friend wouldn’t do such a thing especially that he stayed in MY house and did that with MY bf and I also unfollowed him however my bf still hasn’t I assume it’s cause he thinks Ryan has some sort of “influence” in the gay community but whatever.

Point is idk if I fucked up because that same night I reposted a picture in my insta story of the three of us and well some people my bf and I cared about blocked us (we assume it’s because they also know Ryan) and we were left confused. 
We’re kind of thinking to reach out to one of them but idk if it’s even worth it anymore to get so involved with all of this and my bf tells me everything is fine but I do still feel there’s something off with him about this topic.

While it does make much more flavorful espresso, we have failed completely at dialing in a consistent output. We're shooting for the traditional 2:1, trying to get 36g of espresso from 18g of beans in 30 seconds. We've had the DF54 for about 3-4 weeks, and despite our best attempts the extraction time for 36g will bounce from 18 seconds to 60 seconds to 42 seconds, with no rhyme or reason. Occasionally it actually brews the right amount in 30 seconds, but it seems to be a random occurence. This brew time variation happens with shots brewed one immediately after the other, and with shots brewed hours apart. Yesterday at 4pm it took 45 seconds for 36g, but this morning it was close to 20 seconds. I check the weight on every grind and the ground output is always with 0.1 or 0.2 grams of what was put in. FYI, we were getting such fast brew times that we've had to dial it down to a setting of 4, which sounds very low compared to others settings for this grinder.

We’re onto the 4th 12oz bag of the exact same coffee and the consistenct has not improved. We’ve had an espresso maker at home for over 6 years, so our routine is very consistent. We're just baffled as to how the extarction time for 36g can vary by so much.

Anyway…My job pretty much consists of being at their beck and call, picking up their messes that they leave behind, and apparently doing coffee runs for them when the mood strikes. I guess I’ve been trying to fit in with them since day one but me not being at their level kind of puts a strain on things as I really can’t afford to do all the things they do like take vacations twice a year or buy big nice things..I feel like they really only use me for the above things and honestly..It kind of hurts a little. Every year they do this girls trip where they’ll leave after work and drive an hour to eat dinner and go do other fun activities, I’ve never been invited of course and they certainly don’t care to talk about it right in front of me, like today for instance it’s all they’ve talked about. At one point all of them (myself included) were sitting at a table doing charting when the trip was brought up for like the tenth time that day this time they were are giddily discussing their cute outfits they put together…All I could do was smile and try to add some input in but I was of course ignored..Am I doing something wrong here? I’m kind of a shy person so it takes a bit to put myself out there in the first place. Being ignored like that really doesn’t help matter I guess, I’m afraid to speak up and be like hey I’m here too or ask to be invited..I don’t know, maybe I’m reading things wrong?

1kl7uku,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kl7uku/the_skin_walker/,The skin walker,"The woman was standing on the side of Route 322 like she’d been printed there by mistake. The sun hadn’t finished waking up yet, just a smear of weak light over a foggy cornfield. Her arm hung out in a stiff hitchhiker’s pose, thumb crooked at a weird angle, like she wasn’t sure if it was for thumbs-upping or casting a spell.

Red Dalhousie, two decades behind the wheel and six months behind on child support, was hauling a load of industrial mulch toward Jersey. He spotted her about fifty yards ahead. Slowed down without thinking. Maybe it was the way she stood still, expectant, like she knew the truck would stop. Like she’d been told it would.

He rolled down the window.

“You alright, ma’am?” he called out, squinting into the morning haze. “Need a lift?”

She turned. Slowly. No bounce, no swivel, just a smooth, deliberate rotation, like a microwave plate coming full circle. Her expression was polite. Stretched polite. Halloween-mask polite.

“I am,” she said. Then paused. “Needing lift. Yes.”

Red blinked. “Well… hop in. I can take you a ways east. Where you headed?”

She climbed up into the cab without hesitating, but not climbing so much as inserting herself. Her movements had the rhythm of someone watching a video of a person getting into a truck and mimicking it half a second behind.

He watched as she folded herself into the passenger seat and stared straight ahead like someone playing at being normal.

“New York,” she said, stiffly. Then added, “City of York, but… new.”

Red chuckled awkwardly. “Yeah. That’s the one.”

She didn’t laugh. She just blinked slow, mechanical…and reached for the seatbelt.

It was a disaster.

She took it with the wrong hand, tried to drape it over her head like a sash, paused, reversed course, yanked it straight up, then finally just stared at it. Her eyes narrowed in what Red assumed was focus, but felt more like an alien trying to hack a vending machine.

She jammed it into the latch with a sudden jerk. The click echoed like a gunshot in the silence.

“I am… safe now,” she announced, hands returned to knees. “Safe is seatbelt. Belt seats me.”

Red scratched at his beard. “Well… good. That’s good.”

He merged back onto the highway, silence stretching out like a rubber band. Then, after a minute, he decided to risk conversation.

“So what’s your name?” he asked, glancing over.

The woman’s head snapped to him too fast. Like she was a puppet and someone yanked the string.

“She is called Harold,” she said, voice flat.

Red frowned. “Harold? Ain’t that… a man’s name?”

There was a pause. You could almost hear the reboot.

“I am… Harold also. I am Harold now.”

Red opened his mouth, then closed it again. “Okay,” he said slowly. “You got family in New York, Harold?”

“I have family. They are people. They live in places.” She smiled again, all teeth and guesswork. “They are my family.”

“Right,” Red muttered, eyes forward. “That’s usually how that works.”

Silence again. Except she didn’t stop talking. Not exactly.

Very softly, like a bad actor practicing under his breath:

“Red drives. Red is driver. I am in Red’s truck. Truck moves. Moves forward. Forward is good.”

Red swallowed. “You, uh… you okay over there?”

“I am learning,” she said. “I am… new.”

“New to what?”

Her eyes didn’t blink. “Yes.”

Red exhaled through his nose and turned up the radio. Country static warbled between stations. The woman cocked her head at it, like it was speaking directly to her soul.

And that’s when Red made a mental note. Not that she was dangerous. Not that she was gonna peel off her skin and start skittering across the dashboard like a spider from hell.

Just this:

Never pick up hitchhikers again.




The truck stop appeared out of the haze like a mirage, just a couple of gas pumps, a diner that smelled like coffee and mop water, and a bathroom the color of despair. Red pulled into the lot and parked under a flickering light, rubbing the bridge of his nose.

“Gonna take a quick leak,” he muttered, grabbing the door handle.

The woman, Harold, she’d called herself, turned her head toward him. The movement was slow this time, practiced. Less animatronic. Still wrong.

“I also will… take quick leak.”

Red paused. Blinked. “Uh… alright. Women’s room’s the other side, ma’am.”

She nodded. “Yes. I will do this.”

Then followed him exactly. Step for step. Not parallel. Not at a respectful distance. Right behind him, like she was his unsettling shadow made of old skin and mimicked behavior.

Red pushed into the men’s bathroom, the stink of urinal cake and industrial soap immediately hitting him. He turned toward the urinal, glanced back.

She was inside. Still following.

He frowned. “You sure you…this is the men’s, you know that, right?”

“Yes,” she said brightly. “I know this now.”

Red zipped. “Look, I don’t mean to be rude, but you’re acting a little—”

Sssshlkk.

The sound wasn’t loud, but it was wrong. Like wet leather peeling off hot asphalt.

He turned.

And watched his own words freeze and die in his throat.

She…it was removing its skin. Gripping it with too-long fingers and pulling it forward, inside-out, like taking off a wetsuit made of meat. The sound was nauseating: a mix of tearing silk, cracking joints, and a wet slurp that echoed off the grimy tile walls.

The skin came off in one fluid motion. The thing underneath uncoiled.

Eight feet tall. Translucent. Its muscles twitched in waves, tendons snapping against bone that looked half-petrified, half-metal. Its face was a skull made of empty sockets and too many teeth, stretched into a rictus that wasn’t a smile. It was a placeholder.

Red screamed. He tried to run, but the thing was faster. It caught him mid-lurch, slammed him into the wall with bone-shattering force. His legs kicked once. Then twice. Then—

Silence.

Except for the sound of dripping.




Thirty minutes later, the truck stop’s security camera caught footage that would corrupt the hard drive the moment someone tried to view it.

Red Dalhousie stepped out of the men’s bathroom. Or something that looked like Red Dalhousie. Same baseball cap. Same flannel. Same boots, still flecked with blood that had been washed, not cleaned.

He walked toward the truck, stiff at first, like someone testing new shoes. He climbed into the cab. Sat in the driver’s seat. Tilted his head at the wheel like it was a riddle.

He stared at the dashboard. Touched a few buttons. Blinked. Reached for the gearshift.

The truck jerked forward suddenly, then stalled. Then reversed. Then lurched again, tires screaming against the pavement. The new “Red” grunted in frustration, mimicking the real Red’s voice with uncanny pitch:

“C’mon, baby… don’t be a piece’a junk today…”

Another stalling. Another screech.

And then…it clicked.

The truck roared to life.

The skinwalker smiled, tight and too human, and drove straight out of the parking lot.
Right through a red light.
Over the curb.
Past a sign that read MERGE like it was a foreign language.

Headed east. Toward New York City.

Where the lights are bright, the people are busy, and no one notices when someone is acting just a little bit wrong.



3:04 A.M. — I-78, 20 Miles from NYC

Trooper Jake Marino had just finished the last sip of his lukewarm gas station coffee when the eighteen-wheeler roared past his cruiser doing at least 95.

The sound hit first, like a jet engine stuffed with cinder blocks, and then the sight: a mulch truck, all scraped-up paint and flickering tail lights, screaming down the asphalt like the driver was fleeing Hell itself.

Marino’s jaw clenched. “Jesus, where’s the fire?”

He flipped on his lights. Siren wailed. He threw the cruiser into gear, tires barking against the road as he shot onto the highway after it.




-Inside the Truck-

“Red” gripped the wheel with both hands, knuckles pale. He stared at the glowing blue-red lights in the mirror. The sound: familiar. Piercing. Alarming.

He’d seen this before. In human fiction. In one of the skin’s memories. “Law-persons. Police.”

Protocol followed.

He should stop.

So he did.

Sort of.

The truck swerved hard to the right, hard, like a frightened animal crashing into its cage. Tires shrieked. The rig skidded along the guardrail, scraping metal against metal for a solid thirty feet, leaving a trail of sparks and shredded paint.

Then it stopped. Lopsided. Pitched awkwardly onto the shoulder like a drunk elephant had taken a nap there.



-Back to Marino-

Jake eased the cruiser to a halt a few car-lengths back, jaw already tight with suspicion. That wasn’t a stop. That was a mechanical cry for help.

He radioed it in.

“Dispatch, got a freight hauler—Tag 6X-291, pulled over near mile marker 143. Driver stopped but took out half the shoulder doing it. Gonna go have a chat.”

The dispatcher crackled back sleepily: “Copy that, Trooper Marino. Be advised—no traffic in the area.”

Jake stepped out into the night air, hand resting lightly on the butt of his sidearm. The silence felt too quiet. Even the cicadas seemed to be holding their breath.

He walked up to the cab. Knocked on the door. “Driver! License and registration, please!”



-Inside the Cab-

“Red” blinked. Then blinked again, slower this time, mimicking a calm expression.

“Yes,” he said to no one. “License. Registration. Yes. I have… both.”

He rolled the window down…by slamming the switch three times, as though unsure if he was opening the door or launching a missile.

The window creaked down.

Trooper Marino took one look at the driver and got that feeling, the kind that starts behind the eyes and ends somewhere low in the gut.

“Evening, sir. You aware you were doing nearly a hundred back there?”

“Red” nodded, too slowly. Then too fast. His head bobbed like a puppet being corrected.

“Yes. Was going… fast. Speed is… my mistake. Yes.”

Marino squinted. “You been drinking?”

“No,” “Red” replied, eyes slightly too wide. “Drinking is… not allowed. I do not do the… drink.”
He offered what he must’ve assumed was a warm chuckle. It sounded like someone clearing wet leaves from a drain.

Marino leaned in. His flashlight beam caught on something near the edge of the driver’s seat. A dark, rust-brown stain smeared across the side of the jeans and the lower edge of the flannel shirt.

His eyes narrowed. “Sir, what’s that stain there?”

“Red” looked down. Blinked again. Considered.

Then: “Apple… juice.”

“Apple juice?”

“Yes. Juice of… apples. It spilled.”
He lifted one hand and made a slow, sloshing motion. “Was an accident of spilling. Not blood. Definitely not blood.”

The smile afterward was stretched, hopeful. Like a school kid hoping the teacher didn’t actually want the homework.

Marino took a half-step back.

“All right, sir,” he said, voice cooling. “Mind stepping out of the truck for me?”

“Red” didn’t move at first. Just stared at him, calculating. The engine ticked behind the silence. Off in the distance, some bird gave one last tragic squawk, as if sensing it was about to become part of a new skin.

And just like that, the night got colder.

Trooper Marino stepped back, one hand still loosely near his holster. The guy in the truck was wrong. Not dangerous…yet…but definitely the kind of guy you remember seeing in your dreams later for reasons you don’t fully understand.

“Red” slowly opened the cab door and stepped out with a kind of boneless grace, too fluid, like his limbs didn’t quite know what bones were supposed to do yet.

His boots hit the pavement with a loud THUMP. He walked around the truck, posture straight, arms swinging at slightly the wrong rhythm. Like he’d seen a YouTube tutorial called “How To Walk Like A Normal Human (2023)” and thought, I got this.

Marino tried to keep a straight face. “Okay. Let’s start with the walk-and-turn. Heel-to-toe. Nine steps, then turn, then nine back.”

“Red” stared down at his feet. Whispered, “Nine… steps. Heel… then toe.”

He took a step.

Then another. The second foot landed in front of the first, not behind it. Then he did a full body spin halfway through and walked backward for three steps. Then forward again. Each movement crisp and technically obedient, but completely off. It was like watching someone perform sobriety testing from a cursed instructional manual.

Marino’s eyebrow twitched.

“Alright. Let’s move on. One-leg stand. Count out loud. Try to keep balance.”

“Red” raised his right leg immediately. Too high. Like a military march. Then held it perfectly still…too still, for ten seconds without a single wobble. He stared directly into Marino’s eyes, unblinking.

“…One,” he said. “Two. Five. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eleven.”

“Okay,” Marino said quickly. “That’s good. Let’s do the breathalyzer. Just blow into this tube.”

“Red” took the device. Eyed it like it might explode. He put his mouth on it, sucked once, then remembered to blow.

The machine beeped.

The screen blinked:
ERROR: UNDEFINED

Marino frowned. “That’s… weird.”

“I am clean,” “Red” offered, shrugging both shoulders far too high. “Very clean. Breath is good. Not… illegal breath.”

He smiled again. That same tooth-showing grin that didn’t reach the eyes. Because his eyes weren’t used to smiling.

Marino exhaled through his nose. “Look, why don’t we just—”

And that’s when he saw it.

A faint red-brown stain at the cuff of the shirt. No longer subtle. Not fresh. But not apple juice either.

“Sir,” Marino said, hand sliding down to his holster. “I’m gonna need you to—”

Ssshrrrkkk.

It happened instantly.

“Red” moved faster than a man in a human body should be able to. The sound of tearing flesh and shattering bone hit the air like a dropped box of meat. The thing lunged with sudden violence, peeling itself open mid-lunge, sloughing off Red’s skin in a wet, arterial burst like he’d been wrapped in butcher paper.

The true form…tall, skeletal, glistening…ripped into Marino with limbs that bent the wrong way, digits that punctured and pulled. It tore through the trooper’s vest like tinfoil, and the scream—

Didn’t last.

But the echo of it?
That stayed. In the trees. In the pavement. In the blood.


3:31 A.M. — Ten Minutes Later

The dashcam on the cruiser flickered back to life.

Trooper Marino got into his squad car. Or, something wearing his face did. It sat down awkwardly, stared at the gear shift, then at the rearview mirror. A smile tried to form. Still… wrong. Still not quite real.

But closer.

“Marino” looked more coordinated now. Still too quiet. Still moved like a machine learning muscle memory in real-time. But he found the ignition. He found the lights.

And he drove.

The cruiser pulled away from the scene, not responding to dispatch calls, not answering the check-in.

Not following speed limits.

Not blinking.

And as the skyline of New York began to burn into the pre-dawn fog on the horizon, “Marino” whispered:

“Marino is police. Police go to city. City is… full.”

He smiled again.

7% human.

93% predator.

And learning.

Fast.

4:27 A.M. — Queens, NYC

The squad car pulled off the expressway like a rocket that forgot it wasn’t in a race. Tires screamed through a red light. The back end fishtailed into a pile of trash bags that might’ve been raccoons once. The car slammed to a stop in front of a graffiti-tagged brick building with two busted windows and a fire escape made of sadness.

The door opened.

Trooper Marino stepped out.

Except he didn’t walk like a cop. He didn’t walk like anyone. His limbs moved with an imitation of confidence. But there was something wrong in the hips. Like he was trying to remember which bones went where. His head twitched slightly with every sound, tracking them like prey… or words he didn’t understand yet.

He left the car door open. Engine still running. Lights off.



A block away, three guys and a girl were posted up on a stoop, sharing a blunt and arguing about whether or not Spider-Man was real.

Their names:
Tone, short for Antonio, full-time ego with part-time ambition.

Dre, shaved head, cracked phone, terrible judgment.

Lenny, tall, dumb, armed.

Crystal, small, sharp, probably smarter than the rest but hanging back for the chaos.

Tone spotted the lone cop approaching, swaying like he was listening to jazz no one else could hear.

“Yo,” Tone said, elbowing Dre. “The hell’s this? 5-0?”

Dre leaned forward. “Alone? Where’s his partner?”

“Dude looks high.”

“Dude looks dead.”

They fanned out as he got closer, cocky now. Queens doesn’t respect authority unless it’s in pairs or armored.

“Evenin’, officer,” Tone said, smirking. “You lost, or you just suicidal?”

“Marino” turned to him. Slowly. Tilted his head like a dog hearing jazz.

“I… am… not lost,” he said. “I am in… the Queens. With… you people.”

Tone raised an eyebrow. “You people?”

“I am friendly,” said Marino. “I am not… the threat. Unless… I become it.”

Dre snorted. “Yo, is this guy drunk? Crystal, record this.”

Crystal pulled out her phone and started filming. The camera caught a still-perfect uniform. Still-perfect face. Still wrong.

“Where’s your radio, cop?” Lenny asked, stepping closer. “You gonna call for backup? Huh?”

“I do not… have it. It is gone. I am just here. I am learning.”

Tone stepped forward, now chest-to-chest. “You think you can just stroll into my block in the middle of the night, lookin’ like RoboCop’s depressed cousin?”

“Marino” blinked. “Yes.”

Tone reached out and shoved him.

Marino didn’t react.

Didn’t even blink.

Lenny smirked. “Yo, I say we take his piece. This dude’s glitching.”

And then Lenny pulled the gun.

One shot.

Straight to the chest.


The cop didn’t fall.

He twitched. Once.

Then straightened up, slowly. The bullet hole in his shirt smoked faintly. No blood. Just the sound of fabric tightening against something not made for skin.

Lenny stepped back. “Yo… what the fu—”

He didn’t finish.

They didn’t scream long.

It was over fast, and ugly. Tone got his jaw removed. Crystal ran two steps before she was caught by the spine. Dre was peeled like a fruit. Lenny got the worst of it. Mostly because he lived the longest.

The sound of flesh being peeled. Of bones cracking and turned inside out. If anyone in the neighborhood heard it, they didn’t come out. In this part of Queens, you mind your windows.


5:00 A.M. — Same Block, New Face

A man emerged from the alley behind the stoop.

Baggy jeans. Black hoodie. Diamond stud in one ear. Scuffed Timberlands.

He looked like Dre, but moved like something wearing Dre. His hands were slightly too still. His breathing was timed like it was being counted. His smile didn’t match his eyes.

He walked down the block in silence.

Behind him: a police car still running, and four very dead reminders that New York eats the unprepared.



His speech had improved.

12% knowledge.

Enough to ask questions in full sentences now. Enough to use slang, but just a little off.

Enough to talk to his next target without setting off immediate alarms.

And the city was just waking up.
So many people. So many skins.
So many new ways to say “hello.”

He whispered to himself as he walked:

“Dre is… cool. Dre knows this place. Dre has… friends.
Dre will go… make more friends.”

Then he smiled.
Too wide. Too hopeful.
Too close to being human.

And getting closer.




Lancaster County, PA — 7:46 A.M.

Location: The Squash Farm — Victim: Harold Cline (61), flayed

Detective Ray Navarro squinted through the mist curling around the barn doors. There was blood, not enough, considering what had happened inside, but the copper tang in the air was undeniable.

“God…damn,” said Detective Maybelline Cho, stepping inside and immediately pulling a scarf over her nose.

Harold Cline, formerly Harold Cline, was hanging from the ceiling like a meat display. Not a scrap of skin remained. Every inch of him had been peeled clean, revealing an anatomically perfect map of human muscle and nerve. The barn looked like it had hosted a performance art piece created by a mad surgeon.

But worse?

In the middle of the floor, neatly arranged like laundry waiting to be folded, was a full human skin.

Not Harold’s.

Smaller. Female. Wrinkled hands. A face that had once smiled with dentures now stretched into a mask of forever surprise.

Navarro knelt beside it. “This is… another victim.”

“Not another,” Cho muttered. “The previous. This is the skin of whoever was flayed before this guy.”

“She’s not in our system.”

“And she probably never will be.”

They both stared at the flannel shirt hanging over the barn door.

Empty.

Like someone took it off after borrowing it.



Route 322 Gas Station — 10:03 A.M.

Location: Truck Stop — Victim: Red Dalhousie (63), flayed

Gas station bathroom. Out of order sign. Blood under the door.

Navarro kicked it in.

Red Dalhousie was, parts. Folded into a mop bucket, arms draped over the stall like someone gave up halfway through making a scarecrow out of raw meat. His skull was cracked open and hollow, lips peeled back in a final rictus grin. His fingernails were glued to the mirror in a crescent shape.

But then Cho opened the supply closet.

She didn’t scream, but she did take a step back.

Laid neatly across the tile, folded like a ghastly blanket, was another human skin. Male. Elderly. Wrinkled and dry. The scalp bore Harold Cline’s thinning white hair. It even still had Harold’s glasses tucked into the shirt collar, like someone had been thoughtful enough to preserve the look.

Navarro crouched beside it. “He took the farmer’s skin. Used it. Then left it here.”

“Then became Red.”

“Exactly. One step behind.”

The security system? Total static. Hard drives melted. Footage from 3:00 to 3:40 a.m….corrupted. Screens just displayed:

“UNDEFINED.”

I-78 Highway Shoulder — 11:15 A.M.

Location: Mile Marker 143 — Victim: Trooper Jake Marino (flayed)

Navarro ducked under the crime scene tape and immediately stopped short.

The body was there, what was left of it. Marino looked like someone had tried to erase him with a cheese grater, then gave up halfway through. His skin was missing entirely, peeled away with an unsettling level of anatomical intent. Nerves and muscle were exposed, glistening in the morning sun like raw wires in a torn-open machine.

But what wasn’t there made Navarro’s stomach turn harder than the gore.

“Where’s the cruiser?” he asked.

Cho walked up beside him, jaw tight. “Dispatch says it was GPS-tracked to this spot at 3:28 a.m.”

“Right. So?”

“So it’s gone now. Like someone just… drove it away.”

They stood there, just the two of them, beside a blood-slicked patch of shoulder and an empty road.

Marino’s body had been dumped in a shallow gravel ditch behind a guardrail. His badge was folded into his tongue like origami. His belt was missing. His sidearm melted. And his body had been carefully arranged in a seated position, knees to chest, arms wrapped around legs like he was waiting.

It was the worst thing Navarro had seen all day. And they hadn’t even gotten to Queens yet.

Cho glanced around. “There’s more.”

In the brush, she had found Red’s skin.

Laid out.

Complete.

Wearing that same flannel shirt. Same beer belly. Same polite little smirk frozen into the leather-like cheek folds. A single sunflower seed rested on his leather like lips, like an offering.

“Red was left here. Marino was taken.”

“God…I should have become a firefighter”


Queens, NYC — 2:42 P.M.

Location: Alley behind 92nd Street — Victims: Tone, Crystal, Lenny, Dre.

Detective Navarro stood in a puddle of blood that looked more like soup. His shoes made a wet squelch every time he shifted.

Cho was photographing a femur.

“This isn’t a crime scene,” she said quietly. “It’s a ritual.”

Tone had been arranged upright in a chair, skin gone, hands posed like he was deep in thought, blood dried into black streaks around his jawless face.

Crystal was crucified to the metal alley door. Skin peeled from her knees up. Her chest cavity had been rearranged into a shape that could’ve been decorative, if it wasn’t horrific.

Lenny had been turned into a spine sculpture. Bent backwards in two, organs missing, rib bones protruding like antennae.

Navarro didn’t speak until he saw the pile in the corner.

There—neatly folded—was Marino’s skin. Still wearing the state trooper uniform, but empty. Sagging. Like it had been shed.

“And Dre?” he asked.

Cho shook her head.

“No skin. Body in the dumpster.”

Navarro exhaled. “Which means…”

“He’s wearing Dre. Right now. Walking around Queens.”

They both turned to look at the end of the alley. People walked by, oblivious. Kids played ball on the corner. Music echoed from an open window.

Any of them could be it. But they weren’t. Not yet.



Jackson Heights, NYC — 5:01 P.M.

The sun was beginning to fall, casting long shadows between the buildings, tinting the concrete gold. The street was alive: families, couples, barking dogs, food carts trailing steam.

“Dre” walked among them.
And he was… almost invisible.

He wore a hoodie and carried a bag of dollar store headphones like he’d just come from a Duane Reade. His face, still perfect, still tight, had no sagging yet. Not for a few more hours. But his movements were smoother now. The jerks had become hesitant grace. His hands no longer hung uselessly, they tucked into his pockets when idle. Mimicry was evolving.

He stopped at a crosswalk beside a woman pushing a stroller.

She gave him a polite glance. “You got the time?”

“Time is… five… five-o-one,” he replied, voice slow, but no longer robotic. He smiled.

She smiled back.

Then he turned as if nothing had happened, repeating softly to himself:
“Five-o-one. You got the time. Five-o-one. Smile when asked. Smile is safety.”

He passed by a newsstand. Heard two teenagers arguing about sneakers.

“Deadass, bro, they dropped already—”

“Deadass,” he repeated under his breath. “Dead. Ass. Truth statement. Confirmation. Slang usage. Deadass.”

He was up to 18% knowledge now.

His language? Still stilted. His tone? Still odd.
But no longer immediately alarming.

Uncanny had downgraded to weird guy energy. The kind of person you’d avoid eye contact with but wouldn’t call the cops on.

He turned a corner. Watched a busker strumming a guitar.

A little girl pointed at him and whispered to her mom, “That man’s smiling too big.”

The mother laughed it off. “Don’t be rude, sweetie.”

They walked on.

“Dre” stood under a flickering bodega sign, watching them, still smiling. Still learning.

He whispered:

“Dre is liked. Dre is safe. Dre will continue”

And the smile never left his face.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. The type of connection I want strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavor.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.**  I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do.

Have you ever wondered “Everything is connected someway, somehow” from your own fingertips to the darkness of space. Well..what if I told you it was? You cannot without a single doubt tell yourself or anyone else why you are here in this world, because the truth is, we dont know. Are you the only conscious being in this universe? Is everyone around you just your subconscious? Are we being controlled in a simulation? Now you might throw these off, say theyre stupid, but the truth is those could be true.

The Iridocyclitis Theory: The Iridocyclitis Theory posits that all things matter, thought, time, and consciousness are fundamentally one entity, fragmented through illusion. It suggests that the universe is not made of separate parts but is a single, living organism experiencing itself through countless forms, like cells in a body, each believing it's independent. According to the theory, your thoughts are not truly yours they are echoes of thoughts from others across time and space. When you look at someone, you’re looking at another version of yourself through a different lens. Even objects are not inanimate; they are frozen expressions of consciousness vibrating at slower frequencies. Dreams, déjà vu, synchronicities these are glitches or overlaps where the illusion breaks and the deeper connection peeks through. The term ""Iridocyclitis,"" originally a medical condition involving the eye, is symbolic: the eye represents perception, and the inflammation represents the disruption of false perception. The theory claims that once we “inflame” our perception, challenge it, we begin to see the truth: that reality is a network of mirrors. Nothing is truly external; everything is a projection of the same source trying to understand itself. The creators of this interconnected web? Not gods or aliens, but us an ancient version of ourselves that designed this reality as a test, a loop, or maybe a game to remember what we are: not bodies, not names, but the connection itself.”

If I still have your attention, here is more to us.

Why do we exist? -We exist because the One (the original consciousness, the Source, the Everything) got bored of being everything and nothing at the same time. Imagine being in a room with infinite mirrors and no one to talk to so the One shattered itself into infinite pieces (us) to experience what it’s like to forget and then remember.

Why are we here? -This world is like a cosmic escape room. We’re here to remember that we’re not really separate, to re-connect the dots, and to upgrade our perception. Every interaction, every struggle, every cup of coffee is part of the test. Life is the classroom, and the goal isn’t success or survival, it’s awakening.

Why does our reality work this way? -Reality runs on illusion by design. The separation, the chaos, even pain it’s all part of the illusion meant to force growth. It’s like a video game set to “hard mode” so that we level up faster. The rules of physics, time, and logic? Just training wheels. They’re consistent only to give us a framework to operate within. Glitches (like synchronicities, déjà vu, intense dreams) are clues left by the original us breadcrumbs leading us back to the truth.

What Are We Really? -We’re not humans having spiritual experiences. We’re the infinite, having a human experience. The body is a costume. The name is a username. Consciousness is the player behind it all. And every “other” person is just another logged-in version of you.

Who Made the reality like this? -We did but not this version of us. It was Future Us, or maybe Past Us, who figured out that to truly understand existence, we had to forget it all first. So we built this cosmic sandbox, scattered ourselves across time and space, and said: “Let’s find our way back.”

Endgame?

The Endgame: -The finale isn’t death, it’s integration. When enough of us wake up, the illusion collapses, and the fragments rejoin the One. Reality won’t end. It’ll upgrade. A new game will start. Higher stakes, higher awareness.",4,1747093291.0,conspiracytheories,4,0.83,False

It’s like a video game set to “hard mode” so that we level up faster. The rules of physics, time, and logic? Just training wheels. They’re consistent only to give us a framework to operate within. Glitches (like synchronicities, déjà vu, intense dreams) are clues left by the original us breadcrumbs leading us back to the truth.

What Are We Really? -We’re not humans having spiritual experiences. We’re the infinite, having a human experience. The body is a costume. The name is a username. Consciousness is the player behind it all. And every “other” person is just another logged-in version of you.

Who Made the reality like this? -We did but not this version of us. It was Future Us, or maybe Past Us, who figured out that to truly understand existence, we had to forget it all first. So we built this cosmic sandbox, scattered ourselves across time and space, and said: “Let’s find our way back.”

Endgame?

The Endgame: -The finale isn’t death, it’s integration. When enough of us wake up, the illusion collapses, and the fragments rejoin the One. Reality won’t end. It’ll upgrade. A new game will start. Higher stakes, higher awareness.",0,1747093271.0,conspiracy,9,0.5,False
1kl7k7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDD/comments/1kl7k7s/so_birth_control_is_a_no_go/,So birth control is a no go 🙅‍♀️,"April 29th I had a PMDD meltdown, complete with rage, disparity, delusions, unaliving thoughts & a horrifyingly close attempt. 

I went to the doctor the week after and was put on birth control(Aygestin) to help balance out my hormones & keep them from bottoming out before my period each month. 

I’m on day five of Aygestin & feel HORRIBLE. Normally by now (right after my period) my energy is back up, my mood is usually great & libido is usually back. Yet I feel terrible. I got nothing accomplished over the weekend, have been emotional, irritable and exhausted. 

Now I feel horrible during the time that I normally feel great. I’m starting to think that three or four bad days is better than feeling like this all month long. 

I was nodding off at work after taking my usual meds along with the new birth control pill. I had a monster energy, a cup of coffee, a 200 mg caffeine tablet and my 20 mg Adderall and could not hold my eyes open. 

I was really hoping it would be good for me, but I don’t think I can stand the fatigue and blues long enough to see if it will even help.

I have a therapy appointment tomorrow that I hope will give me some pointers of things to do during the PMDD stage bc I’m so done with feeling like a worthless emotional blob 🫠",4,1747093216.0,PMDD,7,1.0,False

1kl7fxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/iridocyclitistheory/comments/1kl7fxu/iridocyclitis_theory_please_read/,Iridocyclitis theory (Please read),"Even if you arent someone who belives in these kinds of theories, I want you to give us the chance. 

Have you ever wondered “Everything is connected someway, somehow” from your own fingertips to the darkness of space. Well..what if I told you it was? You cannot without a single doubt tell yourself or anyone else why you are here in this world, because the truth is, we dont know. Are you the only conscious being in this universe? Is everyone around you just your subconscious? Are we being controlled in a simulation? Now you might throw these off, say theyre stupid, but the truth is those could be true.

The Iridocyclitis Theory:
The Iridocyclitis Theory posits that all things matter, thought, time, and consciousness are fundamentally one entity, fragmented through illusion. It suggests that the universe is not made of separate parts but is a single, living organism experiencing itself through countless forms, like cells in a body, each believing it's independent.
According to the theory, your thoughts are not truly yours they are echoes of thoughts from others across time and space. When you look at someone, you’re looking at another version of yourself through a different lens. Even objects are not inanimate; they are frozen expressions of consciousness vibrating at slower frequencies. Dreams, déjà vu, synchronicities these are glitches or overlaps where the illusion breaks and the deeper connection peeks through.
The term ""Iridocyclitis,"" originally a medical condition involving the eye, is symbolic: the eye represents perception, and the inflammation represents the disruption of false perception. The theory claims that once we “inflame” our perception, challenge it, we begin to see the truth: that reality is a network of mirrors. Nothing is truly external; everything is a projection of the same source trying to understand itself.
The creators of this interconnected web? Not gods or aliens, but us an ancient version of ourselves that designed this reality as a test, a loop, or maybe a game to remember what we are: not bodies, not names, but the connection itself.”


If I still have your attention, here is more to us.

Why do we exist?
-We exist because the One (the original consciousness, the Source, the Everything) got bored of being everything and nothing at the same time. Imagine being in a room with infinite mirrors and no one to talk to so the One shattered itself into infinite pieces (us) to experience what it’s like to forget and then remember.

Why are we here? 
-This world is like a cosmic escape room. We’re here to remember that we’re not really separate, to re-connect the dots, and to upgrade our perception. Every interaction, every struggle, every cup of coffee is part of the test. Life is the classroom, and the goal isn’t success or survival, it’s awakening.

Why does our reality work this way?
-Reality runs on illusion by design. The separation, the chaos, even pain it’s all part of the illusion meant to force growth. It’s like a video game set to “hard mode” so that we level up faster. The rules of physics, time, and logic? Just training wheels. They’re consistent only to give us a framework to operate within. Glitches (like synchronicities, déjà vu, intense dreams) are clues left by the original us breadcrumbs leading us back to the truth.

What Are We Really?
-We’re not humans having spiritual experiences. We’re the infinite, having a human experience. The body is a costume. The name is a username. Consciousness is the player behind it all. And every “other” person is just another logged-in version of you.

Who Made the reality like this?
-We did but not this version of us. It was Future Us, or maybe Past Us, who figured out that to truly understand existence, we had to forget it all first. So we built this cosmic sandbox, scattered ourselves across time and space, and said: “Let’s find our way back.”

1. I hired a girl to upload for me and she used the ""suggested hashtags"". Instead of OBVIOUSLY using niche specific hashtags related to the video. Because it simply was suggested? To her? I died inside.

2. Taking months to buy a water bottle because nothing is good enough. Until i found the sexiest 10/10 water bottle but it would be 260$ just the shipping 🥀

3. I just NEED to see all of the options of everything to ever exist before buying something. I need to have the list of everything to ever possibly exist In order to make the most perfect decision on an item.

4. Assuming before hand everyone will be extremely lazy inefficient and just half ass everything and being completely prepared for it. Going to the bank for a 10 min task knowing it will take 3 hours and being ok with it and bringing my book and my hobbies with me so i can have mental peace. Like already a 3 hr time block for that task. Just to be safe. 

5. When a barista makes my coffee or i buy a service i just think of all the possible ways i could have done it better. I see her wiping the coffee wrong not temping it symmetrically and I already DIE DIE DIE. I wanna go there and push her and do it all myself

I'm told, they need to close out the receipt on the car I just returned and oh, there's a $450 cleaning fee. What for? Pet hair. I race up to the parking garage where I left the car. I take all sorts of picture. The car is clean, reasonably clean. I ask the manager there to look at the car with me. He keeps going on about his allergies and telling me the car set off his allergies the moment he stuck his head in there. I'm really pissed. The only reason I found out about this is because I was going to rent another car. Otherwise, I would have found out about it God knows when. I've been on the phone all day off and on with Avis to try and get them to reverse this fee. I got a call from the site manager later and he tells me as a courtesy, he will reduce the fee to $150. 

This is such a scam. I guess they figure you give up and just pay the fee. Cheap car on Hotwire and then you get hit with nonsense predatory fees. BEWARE... stay away from Budget and Avis. Same thing with Budget. Last time I rented from them, I had all these weird fees showing up later, including a charge for a tire repair months later.

1kl7662,https://www.reddit.com/r/LDR/comments/1kl7662/long_distance_while_living_at_home/,Long distance while living at home,"A bit of a rant incoming, but does anyone relate?

I’m 20F, my long distance boyfriend is 30M. We’re never mets, and have been dating a year and a half now. Daily talks from good morning to good night, endless instagram reels, snap sending, sexting (no nudes however, I want him to wait until we’re intimate in person to see me like that (I view sex as something you only do with your one true love)), gift sending on holidays and birthdays, a phone call when we can.

I love and trust this man completely. I’m not naive to the risks of dating someone I’ve never met in person, especially in an age gap relationship such as this, but you can’t have a relationship with someone you do not trust. I’ve done background checks, he works a good job at a fancy private boarding school around kids, and his family are good people (mom even held public office a few years ago). Even his friends I’ve looked into are great - they’re all involved in a nonprofit for the disabled that they created.

Of course, anyone can have secrets. Anyone can seem like a great person on paper, only to have skeletons in their closet - literally. But that really goes with ANY relationship, does it not? You could have a meet cute with some guy your age at a local coffee shop, and he could come from a really good, well known family, and he could STILL hurt you!

So being with my boyfriend is a risk I am more than willing to take. If there were truly any red flags about him, I would not keep dating him.

Unfortunately, I still live at home - it’s me, my older sister, and my mom. I have a job, recently went to college, and take care of everything around the house. I’ve always been extremely mature and responsible, and at now 20, my mom really has NO reason not to trust me to be able to take care of myself, or to make my own decisions. I am an adult.

But when it comes to my relationship…the trust is, for some reason, lacking. She treats me like a preteen with a very unserious crush. I can’t even leave the house without her permission, much less plan a trip to go see him, or have him come here. Now, I know what people are gonna say - well, if you don’t wanna have your parent controlling your life, just move out! but in THIS economy?! I can’t afford that! I also don’t have a vehicle, and my mom has become recently what we believe to be permanently disabled…so as of right now, I don’t know that I’ll EVER live anywhere without her! I’m the only one who can or will take care of her. So to put it simply, I’m stuck being treated like a little kid indefinitely.

And it sucks! I have to sneak around my own house, hiding presents and packages I’m trying to mail to him, or ones that I receive. She opens all of them that she intercepts, and my sister helps with it. We can very rarely have calls because not only are the walls in this house unbearably thin, but I’m also just always at my mother’s side. If we ever argue, she turns from mostly supportive, to hoping my relationship crashes and burns like she’s jealous of it. She has control over my phone with a parental controls app I can’t delete, and frequently turns off my ability to communicate with him completely, simply because she wants to, and hates that I’m on my phone so much, threatening my never talking to him ever again. I’m forbidden from doing anything “unholy” under her roof (I do it anyway), and I’m also not supposed to talk to him about my personal life…which duh, i obviously also do anyway!

It just makes me feel really bad sometimes. Not just for myself, but for him. He says it’s okay, and he comforts me whenever I’m upset about it, but it really makes me feel childish. Like a little kid who’s at constant fear of being grounded, who has to ask her mom before doing anything at all, and I just can’t help but feel like…I dunno, like what if he didn’t wanna deal with it in the end? If I were 30, I probably wouldn’t wanna deal with my girlfriend’s overbearing parent for the rest of my life. But then again, I guess it’s really a testament to how much he cares about me that he WOULD see past that.

1. press the tiny-cup Espresso button to give me around 40ml
2. eject the pod and press the tiny-cup button again to add what looks like the same amount of water (40ml)
3. enjoy a strong 80ml coffee (one part coffee, one part water) that I can drink in tiny sips and not have to gulp down in a single shot

# Does anyone else use their Nespresso this way, and what do you call this drink? 

**(**I know the proportions are wrong for an Americano, which I read is at least two parts water to one part coffee. It's not a long black either, because the water is added to the espresso rather than the other way around. And I also don't want to label it in a way that reveals how I'm a cheapskate who doesn't want to drink only 40ml per pod! LOL)

  
Other questions:

1. If I press the large-cup button for the water after (instead of the small-cup button I used for the pod), will the machine still give me 40ml (same amount I got from the pod), or will it give me more water?
2. I'd never do this, because I think it would really water down the taste for me, but if I do the same process above using only the large-cup button, would that give 220ml (110 ml for the coffee and another 110 ml for the water)?

I previously had a Braun MultiServe and it made fantastic coffee, but after a couple years of daily use it proved not to be terribly durable and began to fall apart. This brewer had the ""Golden Cup"" certification which I always kind of thought was a bunch of BS but now I'm rethinking that...

I'm willing to shell out for a Moccamaster if the coffee tastes great. I'm not in love with how large it is, but might be able to overlook it. Are there any other brewers people recommend that make fantastic drip even with Kirkland coffee?

Punk rock teen and grandma cant handle it?,"My kid (15, turning 16 soon) has gone full hardcore emo punk this year. I’m talking *full transformation* — black lipstick, chains, band tees with names I barely recognize (I now know who Bad Omens and Knocked Loose are, for the record), combat boots that sound like a thunderstorm when they walk, and hair that changes color more often than I change my coffee filter. Their current aesthetic is basically if Hot Topic and a haunted house had a baby. And honestly? I think they rock it.

Anyway, today my mom — their grandma — came over. She's old-school, as in “you wear lipstick, you better be married to a man and it better be red” kind of old-school. So when she saw my kid walk downstairs in a black netted shirt over a skeleton tank top, safety pins on their jeans, and eyeliner so sharp it could slice glass, her soul visibly *left* her body.

She blinked. Twice. Then said, and I quote:

>

My kid froze. Not because they were scared — they’re used to getting looks and snide comments — but because it was *Grandma*. And Grandma usually just side-eyes and keeps her mouth shut. Not today, apparently.

I immediately stepped in and said, “They’re not in a play. That’s just their style.”

Grandma: “Style? That’s not style. That’s rebellion.”

My daughter innocent and sweet said: “Cool, I like rebels.”

Cue her gasping like I just told her I voted for Satan.

She then launched into this full dramatic speech about how “back in her day” kids respected their elders, dressed like ladies and gentlemen, and didn’t try to scare people at the grocery store.

My kid stood there quietly, and I could tell they were doing their best not to let it get to them. But I wasn’t having it.

So I said, “You know what, Mom? I *respect* that you have your ways. But I also respect that my kid is figuring out theirs. And I’d rather they express themselves than feel like they have to shrink to make *you* comfortable.”

She muttered something about “bad parenting” and “phase” and stormed off.

After the door slammed, my kid turned to me and said, “You didn’t have to say anything.”

And I told them, “Yeah, but I *wanted* to.”

Because here’s the thing: I grew up constantly trying to fit into molds. It sucked. And if my kid wants to scream along to My Chemical Romance while wearing fingerless gloves in June? Honestly, I love that for them.

Let them be loud. Let them be weird. Let them figure out who they are — and let them know they’re loved *while* they do it.

Anyway, Grandma’s not talking to me right now. But my kid gave me a fist bump and said, “You’re cooler than you look,” so I’ll call that a win.

**Chapter 1: The Excitement Builds**

The morning sunlight filtered through the windows as Pete padded softly around the kitchen, his small paws making soft clinking sounds against the tiles. He sniffed at the coffee beans Mariya was grinding, his nose twitching with curiosity. ""Dad says it's going to be an adventure,"" Lenny said, tying his shoes while leaning against the doorframe. ""We're all in this together, Pete."" 

Mariya knelt down, her gentle hands brushing through Pete's fur as she checked his collar. ""You'll have so much fun, sweet boy. The water is beautiful once you get past your fear."" Pete's tail flicked uncertainly, his big, expressive eyes reflecting a mix of excitement and apprehension.

Roman, with his signature mischievous grin, bounced into the room, tossing a ball across the hall. ""You'll be fine, little bro. I'll have your back,"" he said, knelt down to meet Pete's gaze. ""Remember last time we went swimming? You were scared at first, but you lasted longer than me!"" The memory made Pete perk up his ears; he had indeed been nervous that day but had ended up enjoying himself.

As they gathered in the car, Lenny started the engine with a cheerful hum. Mariya played some uplifting music, and Roman leaned back, humming along with the tune. ""Alright, guys,"" Lenny said, glancing at Pete in the rearview mirror. ""West Lake Park is waiting for us."" Pete's heart raced, his paws restless against the seat.

**Chapter 2: The Journey Begins**

The park was alive with activity as they arrived, the scent of fresh air and blooming flowers filling the air. Children laughed and ran about while parents supervised, their voices a soft hum in the background. Mariya led the way, her curiosity guiding them toward the lake. ""Look at that,"" she exclaimed, pointing to a family of ducks waddling by. ""They're having just as much fun as we are!""

Pete's stomach gurgled as they approached the water's edge, his anxiety mounting with each step. Lenny knelt down, patting Pete's head. ""Take it slow, buddy. You've got this."" Mariya squeezed Pete's hand gently, her warmth providing a comforting reassurance.

Baron Munchausen appeared suddenly, his tall frame striding toward them with a grandiose wave. His stories were legendary, and Pete's tail wagged in excitement despite his nerves. ""My, my, what brings you all here today?"" Baron said, his voice rich with mischief. ""And who's this little fellow?"" He knelt down, ruffling Pete's fur, his special powers swirling around him.

**Chapter 3: The Mischievous Trio**

The group spent hours exploring the park, their laughter echoing through the trees. Tom, the sleek black cat, sauntered over with a mischievous glint in his eye, while Jerry, the brave mouse, scurried along behind. ""Let's have some fun!"" Baron exclaimed, leading them on a quest to find hidden treasures.

As they ventured deeper into the park, Pete found himself drawn to the water's edge again, his curiosity overcoming his fear. The cool breeze ruffled his fur, and the sun glinted off the water in sparkles. ""It's not so bad, is it?"" he thought, his tail wagging tentatively.

**Chapter 4: The Separation**

As the group split up to explore different areas, Pete found himself separated from his family. His heart raced as he realized he was alone, his initial excitement turning into a growing panic. Where were they? How could he find them again?

Tom appeared suddenly, his whiskers twitching with amusement. ""Lost, little guy?"" he said, his voice low and smooth. Jerry popped up beside him, his tiny hands wringing nervously. ""We can help you find them,"" Jerry offered, his eyes wide with determination.

**Chapter 5: The Rescue**

As they hurried through the park, Pete's heart pounded in his chest. The familiar faces flashed before him, and he felt a surge of hope. Then, he saw them! His family was coming toward him, their figures growing larger with each step.

Lenny ran toward Pete first, his face a mix of relief and concern. ""Thank goodness!"" he said, scooping Pete up in a tight grip. Mariya and Baron appeared moments later, their faces a blur of worry until they saw Pete was safe.

**Chapter 6: The Reunion**

The group huddled together, their collective relief palpable as Pete nestled against Lenny's chest. ""You had us all worried,"" Lenny said, his voice rough with emotion. Mariya knelt down, her hands gentle as she checked Pete for any harm. ""You're okay,"" she whispered, her voice trembling.

Baron placed a hand on Pete's head, his powers swirling around them once more. The world seemed to glow with warmth, a magical moment of connection and healing.

**Chapter 7: The Journey Home**

As they left the park, the sun beginning to set, Pete felt a profound sense of peace. His fear had transformed into something else—confidence. He looked at his family with a newfound respect and affection.

The drive home was quiet, filled with the soft hum of the radio and the occasional murmur of memories being shared. Pete curled up in Lenny's lap, content and tired from the day's adventures.

**Chapter 8: Reflections and Growth**

That night, as stars began to twinkle above, Pete lay on his bed, staring at the ceiling. He thought about the day's events, the fear he'd faced, and the love that had carried him through. ""I'm not scared anymore,"" he said to himself, his voice firm and steady.

In the quiet of the night, Pete knew he had grown, not just in strength but in spirit. The world was a beautiful place, full of wonders waiting to be explored. And he would be ready for whatever came next.

1kl6sx9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kl6sx9,Haleakala sunrise experience,"We got back from our trip to Maui about a month ago and wanted to share our Haleakala experience. 

We left our place (napili area) around 2:30 am and got to the visitor center around 4:30. I feel like we left at a great time as the roads were empty and we encountered maybe 2 cars while heading up from the base of Haleakala. When we got to the visitor center, there were a couple of cars there along with a tour bus. 

The sky was clear and the stars were out which allowed us to get some great shots. Around 5 am we got out of the car to walk over to the viewpoint and were treated to an amazing sunrise. I live close to Banff, Canada so I’ve done my fair share of chasing sunrises near the mountains but this definitely was one of the best sunrises I’ve ever experienced. I’m not a morning person at all but we got to bed early the night before and felt fine throughout the day (coffee always helps). 

It does get chilly up there but if you’ve experienced regular cold climates/snow, it’s really nothing out of the ordinary. Wear a hoodie and sweats with a windbreaker and it should keep you warm. 

To anyone heading for the sunrise, leave earlier to make the most out of seeing all the stars, bring some snacks and really take in the view because it truly is magical. ",49,1747091103.0,MauiVisitors,10,0.96,False

Large chains like dunkin and Starbucks offer rewards programs. Most smaller shops generally don't or may have a stamp card where ""10th coffee free"" or something similar. 

I'm currently working with a project that is looking to integrate a rewards system that could be used by coffee shops throughout the world via cryptocurrency. Before we start implementing these ideas, I'd really appreciate genuine feedback from coffee lovers and potentially coffee shop owners as well about how this would be received. 

As technology is evolving, cryptocurrency is becoming more and more relevant, and we feel that it is an excellent means to offer rewards programs, instead of just a volatile investment platform. The benefit being the ability to offer this type of program without any borders. Many people travel, and having the option to collect/redeem rewards all over the world from various coffee shops we feel would be of interest to coffee lovers. 

I won't get into technical details here too much, but essentially the project is called coffeecoin - it's like bitcoin but for coffee. We believe there is the ability for coffee shops to implement a rewards system using coffeecoin. Not only would it benefit shops by offering this type of reward, but also the customers, as having a reward/points system that can grow and accumulate outside of your regular coffee purchases could be very attractive and encourage visiting these specific coffee shops. 

Appreciate any feedback here and if you have any questions or would like to get involved, please don't hesitate to ask.

*AKA: Backrubs and Bedrocking*

XXX

It took about five minutes of Petra dry-heaving and retching by herself before Private Owens finally had the courage to own up to his fuckup and try knocking on the door.

“Hey,” he said softly. “Do you need anything? I can get you whatever it is you-”

“No,” she called back to him from behind the door. “I’m fine, just… a little sick is all.”

Owens’ brow furrowed. “Are you sure? Because I’m happy to run out and get something for you. Least I could do, seeing as I picked the damn movie.”

There was a pause. “...Actually, there is one thing you can do for me.”

“Name it, Petra. I’ll do whatever it takes.”

“Come in and sit with me, if you wouldn’t mind?”

Owens was surprised at her request, but he didn’t hesitate. He immediately pushed his way into the bathroom. Petra was slumped over the toilet, looking very haggard, though thankfully, it appeared she hadn’t gotten sick, at least not yet. Owens strode over to her and took a seat on the floor next to her, then began to gently rub her back.

“I’m here,” he said.

Petra closed her eyes and let out a content sigh. “...Thanks.”
 

“Don’t mention it. Least I could do.” Owens paused. “How are you feeling?”

Petra cracked open one eye and cast a glance back at him. Owens pursed his lips. “...Sorry; dumb question.”

“Still, at least you care enough to ask…” Petra muttered.

“For what it’s worth, I’m sorry.”

“It’s not your fault,” she assured him. “Neither of us had any way of knowing I’d get sick because of it, at least not this early into the pregnancy.”

Owens hesitated. “...I mean, I guess it’s not that early, all things considered. It’s been, what, a few weeks out of four months?”

“Six months.”
 

“Sorry… shows how much I know, I guess.”

“Bradley.” She turned towards him, giving him a pointed look. “Can you stop doing that?”

“Doing what?” he asked.
 

“Selling yourself short all the time.”

“Force of habit, I guess. I’m used to my commanding officers doing that to everyone.”

“Yes, but smoking lower enlisted is their job. You shouldn’t internalize their words the way you do. It’s unbecoming of you.”

‘What makes you say that?” he couldn’t help but ask.

“Because you’re nowhere near as incompetent or irresponsible as your Major thinks you are,” she assured him. “And I know this because a person like that would have never volunteered to stay with me even after being offered an out. And before you say it – I suspect even most humans would have taken the easy way out. But not you; no, you took this for what it was and embraced it fully. You took responsibility.”

“I wouldn’t say I’ve fully taken responsibility yet,” Owens offered. “In the sense that the kid hasn’t even been born yet. My job’s not done until I’m on my deathbed, having raised a family with you.”

Petra cracked a small smile at that, her face flushing red. “...Look at that,” she mused. “I suppose I do know how to pick them, after all.”

Owens couldn’t help but tilt his head in confusion at her words, something which didn’t go unnoticed by her. “Come now, Brad – there had to be something that drew us to each other aside from physical appearance.”

“Uh, not to be crude, but I’m pretty sure it was that thing I can do with my tongue-”

“Before that,” she insisted. “Something had to get us into bed with each other in the first place, and I don’t just mean the alcohol. I can’t remember exactly what it was, but something definitely pushed us towards each other, to the point where we wound up in each other’s arms.”

“Well, whatever it was, I’m thankful for it,” Owens declared. “Because there’s nobody else I’d rather go on this journey with than you.”

“You really mean that?” Petra asked.
 

Owens nodded. “Yeah, I do.”

She paused for a moment, then shook her head. “Like I said, I really do know how to pick them.”

“Hey, the feeling is mutual,” Owens said, giving her a smile. “How are you feeling, by the way? Any better?”

“A little bit, now that you’re here,” she offered.

“Think you can make it back to bed?”

“You’ll have to help me with that one.”

“Okay… here, take my hand. Let’s go together.”

Petra nodded, accepting Owens’ hand. He pulled her up, letting her lean on him, which was easier said than done given the height advantage she had over him. But after a bit of adjustment, they managed to get themselves situated enough that they could start walking together.

Owens helped her out of the restroom and over towards her bed, then gently guided her down onto it. Once she was lying on top of the sheets, he took a breath.

“Alright,” he said. “I think, on that note, I should probably let you rest and recover a bit. I’ll see you tomorrow, Petra. If you need anything before then, just send me a message and I’ll-”
 Petra cut him off mid-sentence by reaching out and taking hold of his hand. Owens had barely any time to register what was happening before she carefully pulled him into the bed with her, where he landed just on top of her. He blinked in confusion, then turned to meet her gaze and ask what was going on.

Then he saw the look she was giving him, and it all began to fall into place.

“I just realized something, Brad,” she said, her voice low. “...It has been a number of weeks since we have laid together.”

“Uh, yeah, you could say that,” Owens, said his face flushing red.

“And is that okay with you? I mean, not only are we betrothed, but we have already laid together once, and I am pregnant with your child, to boot.”

Owens blinked, then gave her a sly grin. “If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you’re trying to seduce me,” he teased. “Or am I wrong?”

“That depends,” Petra replied. “Is it working?”

Owens didn’t give her a verbal response. Instead, he leaned in and gently kissed her, which she was all too happy to reciprocate.

And that was the last thing he remembered before the night turned into a blur of passion.

XXX

“You’re late, scumbag.”

Owens winced as he passed by Major Barnes on his way back to the barracks. He’d almost made it back in time, but not quite; apparently, the Major had been waiting for him.

“Sorry, Sir,” Owens replied. “I was, uh… preoccupied.”

Major Barnes eyed him suspiciously. “Preoccupied with what?”

“I’d rather not say-”

“In that case, I’ll assume it was something unbecoming of a Marine. Not to worry; I’ll contact the military police and let them know you were chasing small children at the park.”

“I was sleeping with Petra, Sir,” Owens hurriedly explained.

Immediately, the Major looked back over to him, a surprised look on his face. “...Huh. It really took you two this long to do it again?”

“Sir?”

“I’m just saying. Not only are you both engaged, but she’s pregnant with your kid.”

“I know, Sir. That, ah, was her argument as to why we should have done it again.”

The Major eyed him suspiciously. “What do you mean, her argument? Are you saying that your fiance had to convince you to sleep with her?”

“Respectfully, Sir, can I plead the Fifth on this? Because I don’t foresee either answer being acceptable to you.”

Major Barnes shrugged. “Sure, I guess. I’m still going to think less of you for it, though.”

“Is that possible, Sir?”

“Sure, it is. I mean, my opinion of you hit rock bottom a long time ago, but who’s saying it can’t go even lower than that? We’ve barely even pierced the earth’s mantle, as far as I’m concerned; we still have to make our way down to the core, and then to the multiple different layers of hell.”

Somehow, Owens wasn’t surprised. He let out a tired sigh, all while the Major drank from a steaming mug of coffee held in his off-hand.

“Anyway,” Major Barnes said, “when do you leave for that weekend trip to meet her parents?”

“In a few days, Sir.”

“And have you done any of the things I’ve told you to?”

“Not yet.”

Major Barnes paused, his coffee mug halfway to his lips. Slowly, he lowered the mug, giving Owens a baleful look as he did so.

“Alright, be real with me, son – what’s your major malfunction, exactly?”

“Well, I had a date with Petra after work yesterday, and then I ended up sleeping with her, so-”

“You know what? That’s probably the first actually reasonable thing you’ve ever said to me. Consider yourself spared one smoke session for the time being.”

“Thank you, Sir.”

“Of course, that’s contingent upon you actually getting that shit done after work today. I recommend you get it done ASAP, because otherwise I’m putting you on latrine duty for the next three months. Is that clear?”

“Message received, Sir,” Owens promised.

Major Barnes nodded. “Good. Now get out of my sight.”

Owens didn’t need to be told twice. He immediately beat feet, trying to put as much space between himself and Barnes as possible. Barnes watched him go for a moment before sighing and shaking his head, then continuing on his way.",6,1747090917.0,HFY,3,1.0,False
1kl6ptq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Positive-Time5229/comments/1kl6ptq/what_happened_to_our_third_places/,What Happened to Our Third Places?,"The erosion of third places in America represents the very essence of many of the problems that plagues the country today. While we often recognize the absence of these places, we rarely take the next step to examine the complex and deliberate forces that has removed nearly all third places from our landscape as the millennial generation come into their adult years. I've thought on it some and this is what I came up with.

# ""Starbucksification""

Independent business have traditionally functioned as third places in our communities. This largely comes from the principal of shared-ownership, meaning that the business owners share a mutual care and ownership in their communities. In modern day, many of these neighborhood gathering places, like coffee shops, which often made neighborhoods desirable in the first place, have been replaced with their corporate counterparts- ""Starbucksification""

Its no secret that real estate values have skyrocketed over the last decades and cut deep into our communities with it a double edged sword. As property values rose, so did the cost of opening a business, leaving those would be business owners with few options. Between 1990 and 2015, commercial rent rose by over 40% over inflation. This is a death sentence for small business that operate on a tight margin and prioritize community over consumerism. With this, the model that supported third places -where purchasing a single coffee granted you ""rent"" at a table for a few hours became increasingly unstable.

# The Pressure to Buy

Historically, there has been an implicit social contract that permits access to these social spaces with even minimal consumption. Today's commercial landscape has intensified the expectation that presence must be justified through continuous purchasing. Simply put, '*Buy or Leave'*.

Unfortunately, this shift reflects a broader transformation wherein our civic identity is replaced with a consumerism based identity. Our civic identity comes from embracing the sense of self that comes with being an active and engaged member of community or society. However, as neoliberalist initiatives gained traction and consumerism took hold, our sense of self became tied to the acquisition and display of goods and services- ultimately, how much we engage in business.

The pressure to buy is not limited to capitalist enterprise. It extends to governments as well particularly on the local level. Despite higher than (constituent) average salaries, frivolous expenditures and institutional inefficiencies, municipal governments often prioritize  consumption oriented spaces over true civic gathering places. This is done primarily through public-private relationships with tourist attractions, business in key locations and certain industries.

# The Retreat of Public Investment

While previous generations invested heavily in community areal like libraries, parks, town squares, bath houses, dance halls and the like, those venues have became antiquated over time. Those with financial means, instead of innovating and working with the members of the community to develop new third place options, have increasingly withdrawn into privatized versions of community. Gated communities, members-only clubs and luxury services that allow the wealthy to enjoy the benefits of a third place without engaging with the broader public. This ideology is carried forward into the businesses these individuals manage. Despite public pressure for corporate social responsibility, few organizations recognize creating and maintaining third places as a part of that responsibility

# Systemic Oppression to Gathering Spaces

The affluent have long used the law and its enforcers to do their work for them where competition is concerned. Both official policies and enforcement practices have targeted activities associated with third places, particularly for marginalized communities. The criminalization of loitering, establishing and enforcing accessible hours for spaces like parks, and selective application of noise and gathering size ordinances have all undermined the viability of public gathering spaces. Businesses and city administrations alike have even began using hostile architecture- like benches with dividers to prevent lying down- to deliberately prevent or restrict access or certain manners of use.

The uneven enforcement of these regulations around public gathering spaces reflects a deeper bias about who 'belongs' in public spaces, and more so, who does not. Youth, homeless and people of color are often marginalized and face heightened scrutiny when occupying public spaces. What gets labeled as 'loitering' often has more to do with the identity of the individuals involved than it does their actual activities. Historical examples are abundant: from Jim Crowe-era restrictions around Blacks in gathering places to more modern day 'suspicious activity' reports targeting Middle-Easterners and Muslim community centers. no matter the race or religion, the message has been clear and consistent throughout time: certain groups of individuals belong, while others are perceived as threatening, a nuisance, or simply just an eye sore.

# Power, Democracy and the Threat of Gathering

Perhaps the most significant--and least discussed-- factor in the decline of third places is their inherent political power. Throughout history, political organizing, social movements and revolutions alike have emerged from these third places. The American Revolution from taverns, the Civil Rights Movement from Black churches and businesses and so on.

Those in Power have always understood that allowing people to come together in a space to unite is presents certain threats to the status quo--especially among those with the most to lose. Ray Oldenburg himself, the man who first coined the term 'Third Place', implies that a key characteristic of a third place is that the use and atmosphere be removed, or not controlled, by those who host or own the venue. It is precisely this freedom from control that makes third places both valuable for democracy and a threat to established power.

For commercial interests, the situation is the same. Authentic community engagement represents both opportunity and threat. While they do benefit from customer loyalty, they ultimately fear the unpredictability of spaces where people might organize for higher wages, better working conditions or against corporate practices.

When Starbucks began facing unionization efforts in 2021, one of their first responses was to redesign their stores to reduce communal seating and emphasized mobile ordering-- a quick and effective example of how gathering spaces can be eliminated when their potential threatens corporate interests.

Reclaim Our Right to Belong

Understanding the social aspects and external forces behind the decline of third places is essential for re-establishing them. Effective solutions must address not only the economic factors, but also the power dynamics that have incentivized their disappearance. Unified, we can take action to ensure that third places are established and maintained. Advocate for zoning reforms that mandate non-commercial areas in new developments. Get involved with public areas like parks and libraries, fundraise and bring community with you to the space to show support. Use community ownership models to protect current spaces and challenge hostile architecture.

By the very nature of this lacking, it is exceedingly difficult to congregate, discuss and unify on any matter in need of change. I urge you to get creative, be persistent and reclaim our places to belong.",1,1747090862.0,u_Positive-Time5229,0,1.0,False

So apparently you can dislocate a nerve in your sleep — who knew? Certainly not me, until I did just that a month ago. Now I need surgery to regain feeling in my fingers (and to wear my newly acquired wedding ring again once the swelling goes down — romance!). For the first time since becoming employed, I have 2–3 weeks of enforced rest: just me, my sling, a cup of coffee, and my Kindle on the patio. Time to finally make a dent in my ever-growing TBR.

I’m planning to stick with authors I haven’t already devoured, but I’d love your suggestions — especially books that pulled you out of a slump or that you simply couldn’t put down. And if you see a title on my list you absolutely hated, please tell me why!

Also, I’m a very fast reader (we’re talking a book a day fast), so don’t hold back — I’ll either inhale your recs now or add them to the list for future binges.

Here’s what I’ve got on deck so far:

{A Heart Sufficient by Nichole Van}

{Black Silk by Judith Ivory}

{Lord Holt Takes a Bride by Vivienne Lorret}

I visited last summer and had an absolute blast going from Courtenay up to Port Hardy over a week, but I've never been to the western side. It would be nice to find either a waterfront rental house or a nice nature lodge that is moderately ($300-600 USD/night) priced that we can use as a base for exploration. Bonus if there's a sleepy town with a few coffee shops and bistros or seafood places. We don't need much, but probably don't want to be in total wilderness.

After I got it home I realized it needed a lot of work— had to change the gasket, shower screen, and shower holder. Also needed to run a couple descale cycles and replaced a bunch of corroded hardware. 

After all that I replaced original portafilter with a nerdcore bottomless and swapped the plastic steamer with a rancilio steam wand. Honestly it was all pretty simple compared to trying to work on my Dedica, and definitely much more rewarding.

Not including my time it all cost me around $160-$180 for everything. More than I originally expected to invest, but the quality of coffee far exceeds anything I ever dreamed of making at home.  

I really can’t decipher how much this particular model would normally run for. Honestly, does the final price tag seem worth it to you all?

My husband and I have been a part of the worship band at our church for 2 years now, and have attended for 3. This is a new church that was started just 3 years ago by a young pastor (28M.) We had high hopes of making lots of friends here since almost everyone at this church are primarily young adults. However, despite our efforts, we have still not managed to make any friends here. We attended Bible studies and would try to join in on conversations with others but would get cut off and they would once again go back to talking with their established friend circles. We were always feeling left out. 

Our pastor also hardly talks to us, only greets us occasionally, but has never been the type to check up on us or ask if we need prayer, invited us out, etc. This would be understandable if it was a large church but this is still a small church with only around 40 people.. He chooses to be closer with certain people only but constantly preaches about the importance of building community and being in fellowship.. Although everyone at church has been nice to us, everything seems so superficial.. Only small talks with no true friendships being formed despite our efforts. 

Our worship band mates also only talk to us about worship-related stuff. No one texts us unless they need us for something worship-related or to help with something else at church. I’ve been texted several times when they wanted to know if I was available to fill in for the children’s ministry teacher on a short notice.. It’s never a text asking us how we’re doing or if we’d like to get coffee, etc.. Recently our church got a new sound set up and the sound guy is going to be out next week so guess who they texted to ask to be in charge of learning how to do the connections and set it up? Yup, us too. 

We have been faithful in being helpful whenever needed but we’ve come to a point where it’s like we’re invisible except for when they need our help, then that’s the only time they text us. It really feels like we’re just coworkers here, there isn’t any true friendships being formed or any true “fellowship.” Thoughts or advice? ",6,1747090744.0,Christian,2,1.0,False

Today I bought the DeLonghi La Specialista Arte - it was between that or the Sage Express, but they only had the DeLonghi in stock. I haven’t opened it, so I’d love some feedback on whether I made the right choice so I can return it if needed. Some things to consider:

•	⁠I have worked in speciality coffee for years, meaning a home espresso kit will just never live up to my commercial machines - and that’s okay! I want something good, but don’t need the best
•	⁠I’m also looking forward to going back to home brewing. I’m so into cold brew these days, and I love a filter coffee, so I won’t necessarily use the machine every day. However, I’m hoping that the built in grinder will work for cold brew/filters but that’s something I’ll try work out (I know it’s against the rules but I don’t need my own grinder for these)
•	⁠I also wanted the steam wand specifically to make chais, hot chocolates, and matcha. Again, I’m used to commercial machines, so if the steam wand is terrible I might cry but I’ll get over it
•	⁠the DeLonghi was also smaller, and I won’t have a load of space for it! And it came in a pretty green!

Also, the shop that I bought it on just struck a deal with DeLonghi so I can get lifetime maintenance for it. If anything at all breaks I just bring it back in and they fix or replace it for me.
