1nnu0gv,https://www.reddit.com/r/energydrinks/comments/1nnu0gv/is_100mg_of_caffeine_from_an_energy_drink_worse/,Is 100mg of caffeine from an energy drink worse than 100mg from coffee?,"Sorry if this is worded kind of weirdly, but this is something I've been wondering for a while. I used to absolutely love drinking Monsters (elder scene kid here so they were basically my lifeblood) but eventually I started having panic attacks which were due to THC and not the actual caffeine, however these panic attacks gave me a sort of new hypochondriac obsession with my own heart rate and for that reason I quit all caffeine for a while. I've recovered a lot in the years since and I've gotten back into drinking an average amount of caffeine (usually around 100mg or so a day), but generally from either coffee or soda. There's still something about the whole stigma of energy drinks that scares me, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to know if it's rational or not.

Basically, tl;dr,  my question is, if I were to drink say, like half a can of monster (which for the sake of the question we'll assume is around 100mg, even though you couldn't realistically be sure) and save the other have for the next day, would that be any more unhealthy than if I were to drink 100mg of caffeine that day from say, mountain dew or something? Do the added things like taurine and whatnot provide any extra energy or jack up your heart rate any more than the caffeine alone?

Sorry for the dumb question, but I'd love to get over this dumb fear and enjoy the taste of Monster again once in a while (in moderation of course), but I'd just like to know if it's a bad idea or not.",3,1758564717.0,energydrinks,3,1.0,False

\----

>!Police are making Robert's nerves ""twitchy; Nits are making little Harry's head ""twitchy"", and Mack is making my eye ""twitchy"" 🤨.... The one person who should be twitching all over, is actually walking freely about the village, casually entering into homes and facilities as if he wasn't a fugitive on the run ... **John**! !<

>!After a year of making fools out everyone in the village, having gotten away with crime after crime, John appears very confident in his abilities to ""hide in plain sight"".  Especially when he comes face to face with someone and they do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!  **CALEB**?!  (*As soon as he rocked up at the depot, and started threatening to expose the Antony cover up, why didn't Caleb just punch him and keep punching him until he knocked him the hell out?!  Could have called Cain and then the two of them could have ""handled the situation"".  John can't threaten anyone with anything if he's not around ... just saying.* 🤷🏽‍♀️🤣) But no, Caleb immediately folds at John's threat to tell the police where Anthony's body is, vowing to take Ruby down with him, unless Caleb smuggles him out of to the country...😒🤦🏽‍♀️.  (*Why ED keeps trying to portray John as some unflappable mastermind, always having the upper hand yet who is really just a pathetic coward, (IMO), I'll never understand ... and I don't want to any longer. This ""villain"" and this storyline have gone way beyond the ""sell by"" date!)*!<

There were a few ""***heart to heart***"" moments sprinkled throughout today's episode, along with some ""***not so fun run-ins***"" ...

**Heart to Heart #1**

**Vic/Rob:** >!Before John made his way to the depot, he made a little pitstop at Keepers Cottage. Intent to do harm to Robert, possibly to drug, capture and torture him, maybe even kill him. 🤷🏽‍♀️ But we'll never know (*thankfully!!*).  While hiding in that tiny kitchen, John eavesdrops on the Sudgen Sibs. After hearing Victoria say how Robert is all she has left and questioning to herself if John even cared/loved her, John aborts his mission and flees, but not before being creepy one last time... asking little Harry, who earlier caught him hiding, to keep he presence a secret (*and possibly giving the kid trauma he'll later have to unpack as an adult*). !<

**Heart to Heart #2**

**Mack/Aaron:** >!Reunited, the BFFs seem to be recovering well, *physically*.  Aaron apologies for not listening to Mack who said from the start that John was a ""weirdo"".  And Mack reassures Aaron that he doesn't blame him.  Aaron seemingly, is coming to terms with the fact that he married a psycho killer much better than Mack is coming to terms with what he went through in the bunker, (*with how Mack was speaking, I think he's going to need the help of a therapist to unpack a lot of the mixed feelings he seems to be having about being held captive, tortured and then later saved by his tormenter).*!<

**Heart to Heart #3**

**April/Ross:** >!Seeing a worried looking April sat outside the cafe and Ross invites her in for a quick chat (*with the EDPD sat in the back enjoying a coffee break, with a murder on the loose* 😒 ....*John could be jumping up and down, waving his hands back and forth, yelling, ""I'm right here, the one you're looking for"" and they'd still be like, ""we'll get to you after our break, trying not to run off this time.""* 🤬🤦🏽‍♀️).  April spins him a hypothetical scenario of having to deal with a ""pushy"" individual who is expecting her to help them, and Ross's sound advice is, ""tell them to get lost"" (*Cheers for that Ross 🤦🏽‍♀️... I was honestly hoping for more out of this interaction*.) !<

**Heart to Heart #4**

**Tracy/Cain:** >!After stopping in the cafe earlier in the day, Tracy's witnesses Cain's brusque attitude towards Chas (*which frankly, I'm all for because she's a hateful peice of work and someone needs to give her a taste of her own medicine👏🏽*) and his failing to ask after Aaron. She later sees Cain in the pub, also being a bit abrupt with the Sugden Sibs when asking is they've heard from John. (*Nope, but Harry has; he smartly keeps his head down and just keeps coloring LOL. Honestly though, Cain is losing it!! Why does he think anyone would be trying to help this evil, ... oops, there's Caleb... spoke to soon.* 😬😂\*)\* Tracy later tries to get Cain to see that blaming everyone is not what Nate would have wanted.  Cain believes Nate would have wanted justice! (*And so do I! 👏🏽 LOL. But he really needs to stop with the blame game.  Anyway, he's about to have an even bigger issue with family loyalty, once he finds what Caleb intends to do!!*  *Side note: I really like the Father-in-Law / Daughter-in-Law relationship these two are forming.* 🥲)!<

**----**

**Not so fun run-ins ...**

**April/Ray**: >!Proving once again that the presence of EDPD patrolling the streets of the village does not instill much trepidation amongst the local criminals, Ray stops April on her way to college to clear the air after their bonding session the previous day. She informs him that Dylan got the depot job so neither of them are available. (*Of course, hearing that Dylan is now working in a facility that deals in Storage AND Transportation, has Ray thinking he can upgrade from his human mules ...🤔*) !<

**Ross/Charity:** >!Ross stops Charity on her way to the hospital, asking about ""bunker boy's"" condition,  before reminding her of a certain ""issue"" that needs to be addressed, SOON!   (\*""Bunker Boy"" 🤣 a tad bit insensitive but funny; Mack would have laughed... well, maybe not, he seems to be going through a lot.  He certainly won't be laughing we he finds out what these two are hiding...\*😬)!<

**Caleb/John:** >!It appears Calab is going to give in to blackmail (*and lose all my respect, which for him wasn't much to begin with LOL*), and he meets John back at the depot.  He explains that the plan is to smuggle John out of the country, hidden in the back of a van tomorrow morning. !<

1nntz6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIreland/comments/1nntz6s/civil_servant_clerical_officer_can_anyone_advise/,Civil Servant Clerical Officer - can anyone advise?,"About a year ago I started working as a Clerical Officer for the civil service after 14 years in the hospitality industry.
The late nights and physical grind wore me down as the pay got weaker due to inflation everywhere else.
When I got the CO job, I was delighted that I had new options available to me.
I could work from 3 days a week, I was auto.atically contributing to a pension and I restored my sleeping pattern and got my weekends back.

However, for the past year while I was on probation, my line manager has pulled me up on several impromptu meetings regarding my emails not being professional enough, my answers being vague at times or making mistakes on invoices.

Although I understand the importance of these things, I feel I am over burdened with tasks. The reason I have mistakes in invoices is because I process them 20 to 1 compared with the rest of the of EOs combined. My emails can be sloppy because I was tasked with looking after the inbox of queries coming in from staff and companies. This can be high volume of 50 emails a day all with specific requests.
Other duties involve monitoring online hub of resources and manual labour of organising event layouts and coffee flasks as I am the only male on an all female team. If there is an event running, I am automatically volunteered to help out so that the others can work from home. If there is tech issues, I am called to assist as IT can take time to answer and I am handling all the admin work of excel sheets and reports for upper management because I'm vaguely familiar with the software from over a decade ago in college.

Recently, a co-worker from another team has been in leave due to surgery and I was volunteered to handle some of their duties, despite having no formal training in this regard. When taking this over, I was told to prioritise this work above all else. As I am now in the middle of this work, I am told to focus on moly other duties, contradicting the original message.

Almost monthly, I am reprimanded in a formal meeting for my mistakes deapite no prior warnings. I have expressed my concerns with the HEO of the team that I feel I'm walking on egg shells on any given day when dealing with my line manager, as I have no idea what mood they are in. This has resulted in nothing changing.
In a recent meeting I was told to slow my pace down to stop making mistakes, but I explained I don't have time to slow down because I have too much to do. They said they would look into it but nothing has changed.
For all the complaints they have presented me, I have undertaken extra training course for writing and play English lessons, as well as devoting time to attend online seminars on topics of note.

It is demoralising to put in the work and effort and have it be disregarded on something small or trivial on a random day. I feel under scrutiny when working as they have backtracked through sent emails to find mistakes or perceived faults in my words. 
Today, after covering for 2 staff on leave (one was my line manager) I was told off for not sending staff a reminder email about an 2 upcoming events they had registered for. Out of those 2 days, only 2 didn't attend. In the meantime I was organising replacements for cancellations, attending online courses for drafting emails professionally, as requested by my manager, looking after the queries in the inbox, taking on new tasks from HEO with strict deadlines and helping out with the missing co-workers jobs. Throw in persistent IT issues for the past fortnight and I have been stressed to no end. Missing lunch breaks and catching colds, but they dont care as these emails should have been ""priority"".

I have passed probation but I am now currently on a year long perscription of antidepressants due to hand tremors and persistent sadness.

The benefits are great but the management are breaking me down.

I dont think I can spend another year before I qualify for mobility. I have my FORSA membership now and my letter of passed probation but I need to know if there is any alternatives or avenues for getting out of this particular place?

Is there any advice on what I can do?

1nntz5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1nntz5o/15_month_old_not_walking_or_talking/,15 month old not walking or talking.,"My daughter is a few days shy of 15 months. She has been babbling since around 9 months, use to say “uh oh”, but hasn’t really begun speaking. Every once in awhile she’ll say “mama” at me or “dada” at her father, but rarely. And if prompted by “who is that?” Or “can you say ___” she laughs and shakes her head no. She is still babbling lots. 

She also is cruising a lot. She was late to crawl (11 months ish?) and started pulling herself up around 12.5 months. She cruises along all our furniture, the coffee table, she pulls herself and rests her back against things to hold herself up,  she even will get herself into the squat position often but when you try to help her up, urge her to walk she just squats and tries to sit down. She is trying to crawl and climb onto things (like the couch, bed etc). 

My point is when did everyone’s kids walk and talk? Things to try to get her talking or walking more? Any advice is welcome. I am slightly stressed.

You know how I used to have that drawer in the kitchen, the one stuffed with manuals for the coffee maker, the blender, even the fancy thermometer? I always felt a little knot in my stomach just looking at it. It was like a monument to complexity, a reminder that every new thing was a potential puzzle.



I remember trying to set the timer on my old coffee machine one Sunday morning. The buttons were tiny, the symbols cryptic. I just wanted coffee, not to solve a riddle. There’s a certain frustration in knowing a tool is capable of amazing things, but feeling like you need a degree to operate it. It creates this weird distance between you and the object.



It’s funny how the best solutions often feel like they’ve just always been there. The trick isn't about dumbing things down; it's about thoughtful design that understands your hand, your rhythm. It’s the difference between following a map and simply knowing the way. The buttons are where you’d instinctively reach for them, the functions flow logically, and before you know it, you’re not even thinking about the steps.



I finally cleared out that drawer. It started when I found something that worked with me, not against me. The experience was so seamless it made me realize the goal wasn't to learn a new skill, but to have the tool quietly and efficiently serve the purpose it was made for, getting out of the way so I could just enjoy the result.



Now, that morning ritual feels entirely different. It’s become a quiet, simple moment, not a test of my patience. The complexity is still there, humming under the surface, but it’s been tucked away neatly, leaving only the simplicity on top. It’s a small thing, but it sets a calmer tone for the whole day.

Being we live in Florida sometimes we take quick staycation cruise just for fun. We booked Paradise knowing full well the age of the ship and recent passenger bad press but truthfully 3 years ago we sailed on sister ship Elation and had a good time. Fast forward 3 years and times are definitely different. 
Pros/cons are listed

Pros
Crusie extremely low compared to 6 days on land.

Con
YOU get what you pay for is the adage to remember. 

PROS
increase security at embarkation including drug dogs. Not aggressive in my opinion. 
CON
Duffy (great inside name) was all over the ship, hallways etc working hard tracking down the weed smell.
Also increased security 2 guards on Lido deck all day. Security outside club nightly and other lounges.

PRO/
dining room food was fair to good and service from fast <1 hr if u arrived early but up to 3 hrs if came in at 7. It was obvious not enough staff to operate dinning room

Con 
Buffet some of the worse food I have seen in years. I'm an eater but everything was fried and generally unappealing to the eye. Buffet line constantly dirty and items rarely refilled. Absolutely no instruction on hand washing or even hand washing stations available. We limited meals to dining room, guys or blue iguana or salad bar.

Service
At best it was perfunctory at worse dismissive and aggressive. Frequently out of liquor or different bartenders had different rules (some wouldn't give you 2 drinks at once on drink package for both individulas) but recquire you to go up in shifts.
For instance at Java house one woman worked most of the time alone and she would have take orders and make drinks. Easily in a.m. it was 20 minute wait to get coffee. 
PRO
Found a great personable bartender on day 2 and she saved the cruise. 


Celebration Key
PRO
Great to have as an option when off the boat.
CON
drinks not included. Irritating.
Food limited to basics and very small portions. Everything priced at DisneyWorld prices! AND frankly it's like a very small commercial Waterpark. Doesn't feel like an island resort but like your at a hotel pool. MANY resorts in Florida are more tropical then here. Wouldn't go out of my way just to visit.

Entertainment 
Pro
2 shows and comedy 3 x night every night and karoke

CONS
See above. 

Ship appearance/ trival
Overall I didn't find the over the top out dated decor a problem what got to me was the lack of maintenance to the ship. Even if ship was refreshed and all the obvious burned out lighting replaces and surfaces painted she would be impressive but sadly that's not the case: broken furniture, out of service elevators, broken windows, cracjed mirrors tappped over, ripped furniture, general abuse without repairs etc.

Also cabin water turned all the white towels brown in the shower that was somewhat unsettling.

Will I go again. Probably not unless on excel ships.

That was the moment I realized: even the scheduling apps we swear by like Calendly can fall short. Maybe you’ve felt the same pinch? Today, more savvy professionals are asking: What else is out there? This article is for anyone who’s found the cracks in Calendly’s glossy surface and wants new appointment booking tools that fit real, everyday needs.

Cracks in the Calendar: Why Switch from Calendly

For many professionals, Calendly has long been the go-to appointment scheduling software. Yet, as your business grows and your scheduling needs become more complex, you might notice some cracks in the calendar. From mishandled meetings to frustrating no-shows and calendar chaos, the limitations of Calendly’s free plan and even its paid tiers are becoming more apparent—especially as we head.


One of the most common pain points users report is the lack of essential features in Calendly’s free version. While it’s easy to get started, you quickly hit a wall if you need advanced scheduling automation features, group event coordination, or buffer times between meetings. For teams, the situation is even more challenging. The Teams plan, priced at $16/month (annual), unlocks some collaboration tools, but many users find the integrations and workflow options still limited compared to newer scheduling tools on the market.

Personal stories highlight these frustrations. Imagine missing a critical client call because of a double-booking, or losing track of appointments due to integration gaps with your favorite calendar apps. These mishaps aren’t just inconvenient—they can cost you business. As more professionals and teams demand seamless scheduling software integrations and privacy-focused solutions, the search for Calendly alternatives is intensifying.

Market trends show a clear shift: users want customizable and affordable scheduling tools that fit their unique workflows. Freelancers and growing teams, in particular, are seeking platforms that offer robust automation, granular controls, and specialized integrations without breaking the bank. Rising costs and platform restrictions are pushing many to explore alternatives that can scale with their needs.
While Calendly remains a popular choice, it’s losing ground to more flexible appointment scheduling software. If you’ve experienced calendar chaos, pricing concerns, or integration headaches, you’re not alone. The demand for smarter, more adaptable scheduling automation features is driving a wave of innovation—and making the year to rethink your scheduling software.

[TidyCal: The Underdog with Lifetime Value](https://prohostsaas.com/tidycal)

When you’re searching for affordable appointment booking software that doesn’t sacrifice usability, TidyCal stands out as a true underdog. Its appeal is simple: a one-time payment—typically under $30—unlocks all core features for life. Unlike many competitors that charge $10 to $20 per user each month (which can add up to over $200 per year), TidyCal’s lifetime pricing means you pay once and never worry about recurring bills. This model is a game-changer for freelancers, solo entrepreneurs, and small teams who want reliable scheduling without ongoing expenses.
What makes TidyCal especially attractive is its streamlined design. The platform focuses on the essentials: easy calendar integration, customizable booking pages, and automated reminders. You don’t need to be tech-savvy to get started—users consistently praise TidyCal for its intuitive interface and quick onboarding. If you’re looking for scheduling software for small teams or solo use, TidyCal delivers a no-fuss experience that just works.

However, TidyCal’s simplicity is both its strength and its limitation. While it covers the basics brilliantly, it doesn’t offer the depth of advanced features found in more expensive tools. For example, if your organization requires deep team collaboration, complex workflows, or extensive custom branding, you may find TidyCal’s feature set a bit light. It’s not designed for large enterprises or rapidly scaling teams. But for most independent professionals and small businesses, these trade-offs are minor compared to the cost savings and ease of use.

User reviews highlight TidyCal’s value proposition: “It’s the best investment I’ve made for my business—simple, effective, and no monthly fees.” If you’re tired of subscription fatigue and want a tool that just gets the job done, TidyCal is repeatedly recommended for its affordability and straightforward approach. For those prioritizing budget and simplicity, TidyCal’s features and pricing make it a smart pick in the crowded world of scheduling tools.

[LunaCal: Simplicity Wins Hearts (and Bookings)](https://prohostsaas.com/lunacal)

If you’re searching for a scheduling solution that puts user experience front and center, LunaCal is quickly becoming a standout name. In the ongoing LunaCal vs Calendly review discussions, the most common praise for LunaCal is its commitment to simplicity. For small business owners, consultants, and solo practitioners, LunaCal’s intuitive design means you can set up bookings in seconds—without a steep learning curve or endless customization menus.
What truly sets LunaCal apart in the world of scheduling software user experience is its mobile-first approach. Whether you’re on a laptop, tablet, or smartphone, LunaCal’s interface remains visually clean and easy to navigate. This is a game-changer for service providers who are often on the go and need to manage appointments from any device. The platform’s accessible flow ensures that even first-time users can create, share, and manage their calendars without confusion or frustration.

Unlike some competitors that overwhelm with feature bloat, LunaCal focuses on the essentials. You get all the core features you need—calendar syncing, automated reminders, and simple booking links—without unnecessary extras that complicate the process. This streamlined approach is especially valuable for small teams and solo professionals who want to minimize friction and maximize productivity.

From a pricing perspective, LunaCal is competitively positioned, making it an attractive choice for budget-conscious businesses. While detailed side-by-side comparisons with Calendly are still emerging, early adopters consistently highlight LunaCal’s value for money, especially when weighed against its ease of use and reliability.

“LunaCal’s simplicity is its superpower. I was able to set up my booking page in under five minutes and my clients love how easy it is to schedule with me.” — Small business owner,
For those prioritizing a user-friendly scheduling experience, LunaCal’s minimal learning curve and device-agnostic design make it a top contender. As more professionals seek out alternatives that don’t sacrifice usability for features, LunaCal’s straightforward approach continues to win hearts—and bookings.

Wild Cards: Other Scheduling Players Worth Meeting

While TidyCal and LunaCal are redefining affordability and user-friendliness, the landscape of scheduling software is more diverse than ever. If you’re searching for the perfect fit, it’s worth exploring a few “wild card” options that stand out in the ongoing scheduling software comparison—especially for teams with unique needs or strict compliance requirements.

YouCanBookMe is a favorite among teams managing complex client flows. Its robust integration with major calendar platforms and video conferencing tools makes it a flexible choice for businesses that rely on seamless connectivity. One of the standout YouCanBookMe features is automated follow-ups, which help reduce no-shows and keep communication smooth. The platform’s broad integration options are a boon for agencies, consultancies, and educational organizations juggling multiple calendars and workflows.

Doodle has carved a niche as the go-to solution for group coordination and meeting polls. If your team regularly faces the challenge of finding the best time for everyone, Doodle features like quick poll creation and easy sharing links make scheduling a breeze. Its popularity among project managers and event organizers comes from its intuitive interface and ability to handle large groups—making it a top pick in any scheduling software comparison for collaborative environments.

Acuity Scheduling stands out in the Acuity Scheduling comparison for its advanced customization, medical compliance, and seamless Zoom integrations. Healthcare providers and enterprise teams appreciate Acuity’s HIPAA compliance, which ensures sensitive data stays protected. The platform also offers deep branding options, allowing businesses to create a fully customized booking experience that aligns with their identity.
For those who prioritize privacy and control, self-hosted scheduling tools are gaining traction. These solutions allow organizations to host their own booking systems, meeting the needs of privacy-conscious users and industries with strict data compliance requirements. As scheduling software diversifies, these wild cards prove that there’s no one-size-fits-all solution—each platform brings unique strengths to the table, catering to the evolving demands of modern businesses.

Final Thoughts: Making Your Choice Matter
Choosing the right scheduling software is less about chasing the latest features and more about finding a solution that truly fits your workflow. As you navigate the crowded landscape of Scheduling Tools Comparison and read through Scheduling Software User Reviews, remember that the best tool is the one that solves your unique challenges—whether you work solo, manage a small team, or coordinate across departments. The data is clear: more than half of readers surveyed this year switched appointment tools, most often for better pricing, improved integrations, or to better match evolving team needs. This trend highlights just how dynamic the world of Top Scheduling Software has become.
Before making your decision, take a moment to reflect on your work style and the quirks of your team. Do you need something ultra-simple, or are privacy and niche integrations your top priorities? TidyCal and LunaCal have emerged as leaders for affordability and user-friendliness, making them must-try options for anyone who values simplicity and cost-effectiveness. However, don’t overlook specialized or privacy-focused alternatives if they better address your specific requirements. The ideal scheduling tool isn’t always the one with the most features, but the one that eliminates your real headaches and adapts as your workflow evolves.

Testing a few platforms is always a smart move. Most tools offer free trials or demo versions, so take advantage of these to see how each fits into your daily routine. Listen to your clients’ feedback—after all, their experience is just as important as yours. And remember, the scheduling software landscape changes quickly. What works best today may not be the top choice next year, so make it a habit to revisit your selection annually.
Ultimately, where you land depends on your style and priorities. If simplicity and price are your main drivers, TidyCal and LunaCal are excellent starting points. But stay open to exploring the full spectrum of scheduling solutions—your perfect fit is out there, waiting to make your workday smoother and more productive.

TL;DR: In a nutshell: If Calendly frustrates you—whether it’s pricing or missing features—you’re not alone. TidyCal and LunaCal lead the pack for affordability and simplicity, but there are several worthy contenders. The right scheduling tool is out there, and this guide aims to make your search faster and friendlier.

1nnts5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_New-Toe-978/comments/1nnts5f/some_ideas_i_had_when_reading_the_courage_to_be/,Some ideas I had when reading The Courage To Be Disliked,"I’m not an expert, just sharing a simple thought of mine. 

When I was reading The Courage To Be Disliked, there was about: we do not think about past “causes” but rather about present “goals” in Adlerian psychology. It said about feelings were the symptoms created to achieve “goals”. I was just thinking that would it be some kind of loop or cycle? That may be the past “causes” leading to the form of “goals” and then, feelings. And the feelings will again become the past “cause” and lead to ”goals”. The circumstances the friend met in the past became the cause that leads to his goal of not going out, and then finally results in his feelings. The feelings again became the cause and the friend was more firmly confirmed about the goals of not going out….  I’m not sure about it, but I just suddenly had the idea.

After that, when it came to the next thing — when the waiter spilled coffee on the youth’s jacket that was just bought, the youth couldn’t help himself and just blew his top. He yelled and he said that he hardly had time to think. The philosopher said the youth just wanted the waiter to listen to him by shouting. And to do that, the youth fabricated the emotion of anger. 

I don’t really agree to it, but at that time, I also couldn’t find a reason to disagree. Then, I thought of the point that the “causes” were serious enough to only results in the emotion of anger. It’s like “causes” were a small spark and it needs something like the wind to fuel it to become a bigger flame. If the causes were serious enough like affecting oneself or involving oneself, then it will turn into a big flame just only by “causes”. 

I’ll give an example of what I suddenly think of — the villains in stories. The villains had trauma of being bullied (small spark) —> The desire for revenge become deeper (the wind keeps blowing/it may also be the goal) —> Hurting others (anger explosion) 

If there’s fire (negative emotions), then there will be water (positive emotions). Using the story of the mother changing her expression when the teacher called, I was thinking the mother’s goal was to maintain her image in front of the teacher. So the emotion was to remain calm. So: what the mother and her daughter was quarrelling (medium spark but not enough to become flame) —> Wanted to maintain her image (putting out the small fire with water/also goal) —> Change to her best telephone voice (becoming calm/water neutralise fire) —> After ending call, the daughter was still there (the spark again reignites after the water is gone) —> To overpower her daughter and assert her opinions (the wind/goal) —> Anger again 

The idea I had might be confusing and illogical. I'm really not sure if this makes sense, it’s just my small idea. Feel free to disagree or discuss.",1,1758564214.0,u_New-Toe-978,0,1.0,False

1nntqwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDruidCaseFiles/comments/1nntqwb/chapter_2/,Chapter 2,"Chapter Two: The Ashwood Coven

The fire was wrong.

James Lycan knew it the moment he stood at the edge of the blackened lot, rain spitting against the still-smoking remains of an old factory. The firefighters had come and gone, the police tape flapped weakly in the wind, and the smell of charred brick and melted iron hung heavy in the air. But underneath all of that, James caught it—sweet, cloying, and acrid at once.

Burned blood.

His staff rested in his palm like it wanted to move on its own, the amethyst faintly pulsing in rhythm with his heartbeat. His familiar, the orange tabby, slinked ahead, nose twitching, paws light against the wet pavement.

“Another ‘accidental fire,’” the cat muttered, tail flicking with irritation. “That’s the third abandoned building this week. You’d think arsonists would at least try some creativity.”

James crouched, running his hand over the scorched ground. His fingers came back blackened, but beneath the soot, he felt the echo of a sigil carved into the concrete. When he whispered the old words, the sigil glowed faintly red. He hissed through his teeth.

“Not arsonists,” he said. “Witches.”

The cat’s ears flicked back. “Oh, joy. My favorite. You know how they always smell like patchouli and entitlement.”


---

The trail took James through alleys where the walls still steamed from the fire’s heat, past the huddled homeless who muttered about “singing flames,” and into the forgotten arteries of the city where no one dared go after dark. He didn’t hurry. Fire magic left scars on the world, and he followed them carefully, letting the whispers of the ivy and weeds push him onward.

At one point, he shifted into an owl to cross the river, wings gliding soundlessly above the water, the moon silvering his feathers. He landed on the far bank, pulling himself back into human form with a ripple of muscle and bone. The staff hummed in his grip.

The coven’s lair was in the basement of an old church, its stained glass shattered, its steeple leaning like a drunk. He descended into the belly of the ruin, each step echoing off the stone.

Inside, the witches were already gathered. Five of them, chanting around a fire that burned blue and gold. Symbols smeared in ash and blood covered the walls, and in the center of the flames, a shape writhed—something vast and serpentine, its body made of living fire.

“The Lord of Ash,” James whispered. His voice was nearly drowned by the chant, but his cat heard.

“Didn’t we kill something last week?” the tabby hissed, eyes wide. “Why do they always want to bring something back?”

James stepped forward, staff raised. The wards flared, bathing the room in silver light. The witches’ chant faltered, but the fire spirit lashed against its prison, sparks flying like meteors.

“You don’t belong here,” James said, his voice carrying the weight of a storm. “Back to the ashes you came from.”

The eldest witch snarled, her eyes glowing ember-red. “You think you can stop us, druid? We’ve seen your kind fade into myths. The world belongs to fire now!”

The flames surged toward him.


---

The fight was chaos. Fire roared across the stone walls, the heat blistering, the chants twisting into a cacophony. James called on the storm, his staff slamming against the ground as rain burst from the air itself, hissing against the flames. The coven shrieked, their robes steaming as the deluge broke their circle.

One witch lunged, dagger flashing. James caught her with the butt of his staff, knocking her aside, then swept the staff in an arc, lightning cracking from the amethyst stone. The bolt struck the circle, shattering the runes and making the half-formed spirit howl with rage.

James shifted mid-motion, feathers sprouting, bones reshaping, until an owl burst through the rising smoke. He dove low, claws tearing through one witch’s face before shifting back into a man, landing heavily with the staff in both hands.

The tabby familiar darted across the room, weaving between ankles, tripping one witch into the fire. Her scream was cut short.

Finally, James drove the staff into the heart of the flames, chanting words so old they made the air itself vibrate. The amethyst burned white-hot. Wind and rain swirled around him, a storm in miniature, suffocating the fire spirit until only ash remained.

Silence fell. The coven lay broken, the church basement reeking of smoke and blood. James pulled the staff free, its glow fading, and wiped soot from his brow.

The cat licked its paw delicately. “Well. That was dramatic.”

James’s golden-flecked eyes lingered on the ashes. “Too dramatic. They weren’t summoning him from scratch. They were… feeding him. And he’s hungry.”

The tabby paused mid-lick. “Oh. Well. That’s not ominous at all.” 

Interlude: Roots in Concrete

The morning after, James walked the city streets like any other commuter. His trench coat was clean again, his boots polished. The satchel on his side clinked softly with glass vials and herbs, mistaken for medicine bottles by passersby.

He stopped at a corner coffee shop, ordering plain black coffee and a bagel with cream cheese. The barista smiled at him—nervous, maybe, but curious. James’s eyes always made people hesitate, but his smile, when he offered it, carried an ease that disarmed them.

Back at his apartment, he set the bagel aside for the cat, who ate it happily despite always claiming to be above “human food.” James sat cross-legged on the floor, herbs spread around him in neat piles. He crushed mugwort with a mortar and pestle, adding it to a small jar already labeled in his precise handwriting.

When the work was done, he leaned back in the chair by the window, the city skyline stretching jagged and grey. He lit a stick of sage, the smoke curling upward, and listened. To the plants, the birds, the rhythm of traffic. The city was alive, and James Lycan made it his business to listen to its every heartbeat.

For now, there was peace. But the memory of the fire spirit’s howl lingered, faint but unignorable, like thunder rolling somewhere far away.

And James knew storms always came closer.

Interlude 1.5 Between the Fires

James Lycan woke late, sunlight slanting through the blinds in golden stripes across his face. He wasn’t much for alarm clocks; the city itself usually woke him—its sounds, its moods, the subtle shifting of energy in its concrete veins. Today, though, the city felt calm. Tired, maybe, after the fire that had nearly torn through it last night.

Luke, the orange tabby, sprawled across his chest like a warm sack of bricks. His whiskers twitched as James tried to move.

“You’re heavy,” James muttered.

“You’re weak,” Luke replied in his mind, not bothering to open his eyes. “Maybe lift something heavier than books once in a while.”

James chuckled, easing the cat aside and standing. His muscles were tight, bruises lingering from the coven fight. He stripped off his shirt, checked the healing gouge across his ribs in the bathroom mirror, and muttered a brief healing charm under his breath. The skin closed, leaving only a faint pink line.

After breakfast—a black coffee for James, a piece of leftover salmon for Luke—they stepped into the city’s pulse. He didn’t drive. He walked, staff disguised as a walking stick, satchel slung across his shoulder. Luke padded alongside him, tail high, ignoring the curious glances of strangers who thought he was just a normal housecat.

Today, James wasn’t hunting monsters. He was gathering whispers.

And for whispers, there was only one place to go.


---

The little bookstore was tucked between a pawnshop and a failing laundromat, its painted sign faded but legible: “Lavin’s Rare & Used.” To the average passerby, it was just another dusty old shop clinging to life. But to those who knew where to look, it was a beacon.

Marie Lavin owned it.

When James pushed open the creaky door, the smell of old paper and sandalwood hit him, comforting in a way only certain places could be. The bell above the door chimed, and from behind a shelf came Marie herself.

She was five feet tall, dyed red hair in a messy bun, hazel eyes bright and sharp behind thin glasses. She wore a fitted sweater and jeans that hugged her curves, and she moved with a casual confidence that made it clear she didn’t care who noticed. Her chestnut lipstick curved into a grin when she saw James.

“Well, well,” she said, arms crossed, “if it isn’t my favorite druid detective. You look like hell.”

James smirked, leaning on his staff. “You should see the other guys.”

Marie tilted her head. “I heard about the fire last night. Ashwood Coven, wasn’t it? You really do have a talent for picking fights with the worst company.”

Luke jumped up onto the counter, tail flicking. “Correction: the worst company keeps picking fights with us.”

Marie laughed, reaching over to scratch Luke behind the ears. “Morning, furball.”

Luke purred loudly. “Finally, someone appreciates me.”

James rolled his eyes.


---

Marie ran her bookstore as a cover, but it was more than that. Behind the register, beneath false drawers and carefully concealed compartments, she kept files, notes, contacts—an entire network of information on supernatural goings-on. If something strange was stirring in the city, Marie knew about it. And if she didn’t, she knew someone who did.

“Got anything for me?” James asked, stepping closer.

Marie leaned on the counter, close enough that he caught the faint scent of her perfume—jasmine and cedar. “That depends,” she said, eyes glinting. “Are you asking for professional reasons, or personal ones?”

James’s mouth quirked into the faintest smile. “Both.”

She arched a brow. “Careful, Lycan. You might charm me into giving you my best secrets.”

Luke snorted. “Please. As if you don’t love stringing him along.”

Marie winked at the cat. “Somebody has to.”

James shook his head, but he didn’t deny it. Marie was sharp, unshakable, and maybe too smart for her own good. He liked that about her. More than liked it, if he was honest. But honesty wasn’t something James gave away lightly.


---

He spent an hour in the shop, flipping through old tomes while Marie updated him on whispers: disappearances in the subway (probably not unrelated to his last case), a strange humming heard near the docks, rumors of a new cult calling themselves The Choir of Silence.

Before he left, she caught his wrist gently, her hazel eyes searching his.

“Be careful, James,” she said softly. “You look after this city, but who looks after you?”

James didn’t answer. He just tipped his staff in farewell and stepped back into the rhythm of the streets, Luke trotting at his heels.

Behind him, Marie watched through the window, chewing her lip thoughtfully, her clever mind already turning over what she hadn’t told him yet.

11pm- 

come down and do the pass down log with swing shift who's leaving


11pm - 2:30am- 

check/rinse pool filters

Clean and restock the lobby coffee maker

Review and compile folder of day's documents

Go into the kitchen/dining room and take a full inventory (takes me at least an hour of bending, reaching, lifting, etc) 

Begin to prepare to-go lunches 

Clean keys

Make new key sleeves

Finish check-ins/be available for calls

Collect all the inside trash in the building 

Count the till


2:30-3:30- 

night audit, although this can take longer if there's any complications

Assign rooms + make keys + authorize VCCs for days incoming guests (if a VCC won't authorize I need to call) 


3:30-4:00- 

finish making to-go breakfasts (anywhere from 5-15, very time consuming) 


4:00-6:00-

Make breakfast. This time is the most time consuming single activity of my job. 

I have to: turn on ovens, warmers, waffle irons 

Cook several large trays of potatoes, eggs, and sausage

Make waffle mix

Refill *everything* in the displays, from jelly to ketchup to creamer to English muffins

Replace yogurt in machines as needed

Clean clean clean. Today I had to get on the floor and scrub a giant stain from the carpet in the dining room, also mop and do all the dishes from everything I've cooked

Refill fresh toppings

Often times this is when I finish inventory as I didn't have time earlier in the night to get to it all

Make the coffee

Refill all the dairy containers

Clean up the dining room

And more

6:00-7:00- 

Empty trash cans outside the building and take them to the dumpster

Refill printers paper

Do some check outs

Answer calls


So imagine my surprise when the morning breakfast attendant comes in and does basically nothing for several hours, and morning shift comes in and acts irritated that I didn't get more done. 

I'm supposed to do it all while problem solving issues that come up overnight from guests too.

Maybe I'm overreacting, but this feels like a lot. I am there for 8 hours and I don't sit down more than ten minutes tops. I make $17.50 an hour. I don't understand why I make the entire breakfast, and clean up the messes, and refill all the displays. Why do we have a breakfast person?

First, they complained that I didn’t have washcloths. I explained that I have plenty of towels and hand towels and extras in the linen closet. That wasn’t satisfactory so I had my cleaner drop some off at the door for them. She said in her review that my place “lacked basic necessities” and in the same paragraph said that I “made the situation right by dropping them off”

Second, she said my place isn’t walking distance to town, but rather a short drive. It’s 3 blocks…if that’s too far for guests to walk, I have free parking passes I provide but I don’t believe that should be dinged against me. 

Third, complained that I don’t provide sugar or honey for the coffee and tea that I provide. In one of my photos of the fridge, there’s a few cans of La Croix in there. But that’s not always the case and she said she was disappointed I didn’t provide La croix OR any other snacks (an Airbnb benefit she has come to expect).

Last thing, she publicly wrote that I was slow to respond and gave me a 2 stars on communication. I went and checked our messages/calls and the longest I took to get back to her was an hour and 10 mins….

Can I do anything to get rid of this review? Do you recommend I publicly respond correcting these complaints so that other guests won’t be thrown off by this review?

1nntn6q,https://i.redd.it/56378clf9rqf1.png,Help with my endoscopy,"Hi there,

Since April of this year, I have been so ill. Constant heartburn and indigestion/acid reflux. I have been taking omeprazole to try and help but it doesn't work for very long. I've been downing peptac and Rennies like there is no tomorrow but it's expensive.

 In May, I went to doctors and got blood tests, normal, so we left it.

Come to a few weeks ago, I started vomiting blood. the blood got worse, every single day. I had lost 4 stone since June. I can't eat, I can feel the food slowly go down my throat and I feel like gagging. After about two spoonfuls of soup I am so bloated and full. I can only eat a few spoonfuls of soup a day, under 300 cals. I had to use a suppository once a week to go for a poo. Coffee grounds poo, so off I went back to the doctors. They did emergency blood on the spot and I had anemia. Something that wasn't there just a few months before. Iron tablets prescribed and told to contact a gastro doctor. So we did.

We had a phone call and they've sent me for an endoscopy then I have to get a abdominal scan in a few weeks. These were my results. They said that they didn't biopsy the polyps due to me being on omeprazole.

Any idea what it could be? I can't eat, I struggle to swallow and I think the acid reflux is finally catching up to me.

18F, diagnosed with IBS as a child and invertase deficiency. Just on melatonin, omeprazole, famotidine and the mini pill. I take a glycerin suppository once a week and rennies and peptac as needed.

Family history; My grandmother died of stomach cancer in her 40s/50s. My other grandmother is going through testing now but they think it's to do with her kidneys. My dad and sister are coeliac but I've tested negative for that. My dad also had the helicabacter thing. My mum had gallstones and her her gallbladder removed.

Im terrified they'll write this off as IBS. I know it's not. I just want help and I just want to be able to eat. Im losing around 2.5-3.5kg a week. I feel so ill constantly with stomach cramps as well and a sore throat. I'm scared this is going to damage me permanently if I don't find out soon.

When I washed my face this morning, it happened. A horrible, sharp pain in my lower back and DOWN I WENT. 
I can't walk. I can't stand. I can't sit upright.
I can't do ANYTHING. My partner had to come home from work to feed our dogs and let them outside, he brought me food, snacks and water, made me some coffee and went back to work.
When I needed to go to the toilet I had to drag myself on the floor. It took me an hour to even get off the couch.
I was crying, sweating and shaking from pain.
I couldn't get up on the toilet and had to pee in the shower and I'm so deeply ashamed about it, I just want earth to open up and swallow me alive.

Every move I make results in horrible pain and right now, I just need to tell someone.
I'll call my doctor tomorrow if it doesn't get better. But right now I'm just a sad lil lump of meat and need someone to tell me everything is going to be okay 😭",1,1758563801.0,Pain,0,1.0,False

I bake a lot of gluten free, and often the recipes call for superfine / finely milled grains. 

I use the ingredients listed below, so based on these and the need to get them as fine as possible, I’m wondering what would be the best home mill?

- Brown rice flour, white rice flour, sweet white rice flour
- Millet
- Sorghum
- Teff
- Buckwheat
- Oat

Any insight would be much appreciated as it’s quite a big upfront investment. 

Also, one concern I have with a home mill is noise as I live in an apartment building. Would it be comparable to a vacuum or coffee machine, or louder? Any tricks to isolate the sound?

[**Samesurf invented modern co-browsing.**](https://samesurf.com/our-technology/patents/#patents)

The e-commerce landscape is on the brink of a profound transformation.  The industry is now moving beyond reactive tools and simple recommendations to an era of “agentic commerce,” where AI systems act autonomously on behalf of users. This summary provides a [strategic analysis](https://samesurf.com/an-expert-analysis-of-the-parallels-between-agentic-ai-and-cobrowse/) of this shift, delineating the fundamental differences between Agentic AI and its predecessors. It outlines a four-level progression of autonomous shopping, from basic search to full purchasing delegation. 

While this evolution promises unprecedented efficiency and personalization, it introduces a critical “trust paradox”—a psychological and practical barrier to consumer adoption, particularly for high-value or emotionally resonant purchases. This report is based on the premise that a purely autonomous model is not the most viable path to scalable success. Instead, the optimal strategy lies in a hybrid, human-in-the-loop framework where Agentic AI handles high-volume, low-stakes tasks, and a human expert intervenes for complex, trust-sensitive interactions. Finally, this report demonstrates how Samesurf’s patented technology serves as the essential bridge for this hybrid model, transforming moments of potential frustration into opportunities for trust-building, visual collaboration, and increased conversion.

# The Agentic AI Revolution—Beyond Generative AI

The ongoing evolution of artificial intelligence is fundamentally re-engineering how digital services are provided, with Agentic AI emerging as the next significant leap forward. To grasp its transformative potential, it is essential to first establish a clear, foundational understanding of what Agentic AI is and how it distinguishes itself from previous generations of AI technology. This shift represents a move from systems that merely respond to commands to those that proactively take action.

# Defining the Autonomous Core: Autonomy, Reasoning, and Action

Agentic AI represents an advanced class of artificial intelligence characterized by its capacity for autonomous decision-making and action. Unlike traditional AI systems which are typically reactive and operate within rigid, predefined frameworks, agentic AI can set goals, plan, and execute tasks with minimal human intervention. These independent systems are designed to automatically respond to dynamic conditions by taking procedural, algorithmic, and even creative steps to produce a desired outcome.

The power of Agentic AI is rooted in a set of mutually reinforcing design principles with Large Language Models (LLMs) serving as a central “brain” for reasoning. This reasoning capability allows an agent to analyze gathered data, understand context, and formulate potential solutions. A key component of this process is goal decomposition, where a complex, high-level goal is broken down into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. For example, a user’s request to an AI enabled device to “plan a trip” is not handled as a single, static prompt; rather, the agent will decompose it into a series of actionable steps, such as “book flights,” “find hotels,” and “plan an itinerary”. Critically, these agents are not self-contained; they utilize a variety of tools and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to gather real-time data and execute actions within underlying systems to achieve their objectives. This enables them to go beyond content creation or simple function calling and effectuate real-world changes.

# The Three-Tiered AI Landscape: A Framework for E-commerce

To better understand the place of Agentic AI in the broader technological ecosystem, a three-tiered framework helps to delineate the landscape:

* **Tier 1: Traditional AI and Chatbots:** These systems are at the base of the pyramid. They are reactive since they operate on scripted responses and rigid decision trees. A traditional chatbot might be able to answer a “yes” or “no” question about product stock or provide a pre-programmed response to a frequently asked question, but their functionality is limited to their programming.

* **Tier 2: Generative AI:** This tier is focused on the creation of new content based on user prompts, such as text, images, or code. An LLM is at the heart of this technology, and its primary value is derived from what the model can generate. In an e-commerce context, a generative AI model could be used to create marketing copy or suggest product ideas, but it does not take autonomous action.

* **Tier 3: Agentic AI:** Sitting at the top of the pyramid, Agentic AI is a subset of generative AI that is centered around the orchestration and execution of agents. It utilizes an LLM as its “brain” to perform actions through tools, but its primary function is to go beyond content creation to achieve higher-level goals. For instance, a generative AI model might create marketing materials, but an Agentic AI system could then be used to deploy those materials, track their performance, and automatically adjust the strategy based on the results, without further human input.

The fundamental difference across these tiers is the shift from a passive *response* to a proactive *action*. While an AI agent might perform a specific task, Agentic AI is the overarching system that coordinates and manages multiple agents to handle complex, multi-step workflows. The progression to Agentic AI marks a fundamental shift from a “creation-based” to an “orchestration-based” economy for digital services. The efficiency gains from generative AI content creation have created a new operational bottleneck: how to deploy and manage this vast amount of content at scale. Agentic AI emerges to solve this problem by taking on the execution layer, transforming AI from a creative assistant into a proactive virtual collaborator. This signifies that the focus of technology investment is shifting from building better models to building more effective orchestration layers that can manage and deploy those models to achieve complex, real-world objectives.

**The Emergence of Autonomous Shopping**

The retail industry is on the brink of its next seismic shift, driven by the emergence of Agentic AI and the concept of “agentic commerce”. This new paradigm is fundamentally re-engineering how shoppers discover, decide, and buy, moving beyond traditional search queries to a world where intelligent agents proactively manage the entire shopping journey.

# From Assisted to Autonomous: A New Customer Journey

The old e-commerce model relied on customers manually researching and transacting themselves. The new model, driven by agentic AI, is proactive and self-directed. Instead of a customer using a chatbot to ask for product ideas, the agent takes action on their behalf—from identifying a need, to comparing options, and finally completing a purchase. These agents are not just simple assistants; they are sophisticated systems capable of understanding complex requirements, comparing options, negotiating terms, and completing purchases. They can analyze market data, customer behavior, and financial statements to automate a wide range of tasks, from fraud detection to optimizing investment strategies. The core of their capability is the ability to go beyond simple keyword matching and use contextual information to provide highly relevant and personalized results, anticipating customer needs before they are even explicitly stated.

# A Blueprint for Automation: The Four Levels of Agentic Commerce

To help leaders navigate this strategic shift, a four-level model of agentic commerce provides a clear blueprint for the progression of autonomous shopping.

* **Level 1: Discovery and Research:** At this initial stage, shoppers lean on generative AI platforms like ChatGPT or Gemini for brainstorming ideas, such as gift suggestions or workout gear. This is a low-friction, high-curiosity space where the primary opportunity for brands is to influence the user before a purchasing intent is solidified. The associated risk is that a brand’s unique storytelling may be replaced by generic AI suggestions unless its content is compelling and accessible.

* **Level 2: Intelligent Find and Compare:** The AI system provides curated search results that include product specifications, reviews, pricing, and retailer availability. For shoppers, this provides clarity and confidence in their decision-making. However, brands that lack structured product data or API accessibility may simply not appear in the results, as the agent’s ability to find and present information is dependent on the quality of the underlying data.

* **Level 3: Seamless Buy and Execute:** At this level, agents go beyond suggestions and actually complete the purchase. With access to a digital wallet and shipping preferences, the transaction is completed inside the agent’s own interface, eliminating the need for the user to navigate different websites or fill out forms. This reduces friction and is exemplified by systems like Amazon’s “Buy for Me”.

* **Level 4: Autonomous Agentic Commerce:** This is the final and most advanced stage. The agent proactively anticipates a user’s needs and purchases items based on data patterns and preferences, without any user request. This provides the ultimate convenience, as the user barely has to lift a finger. However, this level also introduces the most significant strategic risk for retailers.

The progression to Level 4 Agentic Commerce presents a fundamental threat of disintermediation to brands and retailers. In traditional e-commerce, the value chain is built on driving direct traffic to a brand’s website to facilitate the transaction. As commerce evolves to Level 3 and 4, the transaction is increasingly handled within the agent’s experience, bypassing traditional storefront browsing and creating a new competitive landscape. The brand-customer relationship becomes intermediated by the AI layer, and the source of customer loyalty shifts from the brand to the agent itself. The consequence is that brands must transition from traditional SEO to a new paradigm of “metadata marketing,” ensuring their product data is structured, complete, and accessible to agents to remain visible and competitive.

# The Trust Paradox—Bridging the Gap Between Autonomy and Assurance

While the promise of Agentic AI is the ultimate in efficiency and convenience, the progression to a fully autonomous shopping experience is not without its friction. A significant psychological and practical barrier—a “trust paradox”—emerges as a key limiting factor to mass adoption, particularly for complex or emotionally resonant purchases.

# Why Consumers Hesitate: The Trust-Autonomy Disconnect

The consumer’s willingness to delegate tasks to an AI agent varies dramatically based on the purchase category. For low-stakes, routine, and repetitive buys, such as replenishing laundry detergent, pet food, or coffee pods, automation is a welcome time-saver. The functional criteria are clear (availability, price, delivery time), and the trade-off of control for convenience is a straightforward benefit.

However, the dynamics shift entirely for high-stakes, emotional, or personal purchases, such as fashion, furniture, jewelry, or booking travel. In these scenarios, consumers are far more reluctant to give up control. Such decisions are not purely logical; they involve personal taste, mood, aspirations, and an emotional connection with the product. The complete removal of human interaction creates a critical “trust gap” that limits the application and scalability of a purely autonomous model. The core consumer concerns are explicit and actionable.  Consumers worry about the security of their payment and personal data, the privacy of their personal information, the risk of the AI “misunderstanding needs,” and the potential for the AI to fail to recognize or prevent fraudulent activity.

# The Case for a Hybrid Customer Journey

The flaw in a model of pure automation is that while it promises ultimate efficiency, it can also erode the very confidence required to complete a sale, especially in moments that require empathy and reassurance. The central challenge is a causal loop that will prevent the mass adoption of fully autonomous shopping. The more complex or high-value a task becomes, the more the consumer’s need for human assurance and control clashes with the agent’s core principle of autonomy. This creates a point of psychological friction. The agent’s independence, a benefit for routine buys, becomes a source of anxiety for emotional ones, because the consumer’s desire for control directly contradicts the AI’s core functionality.

For agentic commerce to scale beyond low-stakes use cases, the most viable path forward is a “human-in-the-loop” model. This approach leverages Agentic AI for its strengths—automating routine tasks and scaling efficiently—and strategically introduces a human expert to handle situations that require empathy, reassurance, or complex guidance. As one expert notes, the future of customer experience is a combination of “AI combined with human agents”. The most successful systems will be designed with a built-in “hand-off” mechanism to a human expert at these critical junctures, acknowledging that the trust gap is a feature of the current system – not a bug to be solved by further automation.

# Samesurf’s Role in a Hybrid E-commerce Future

The strategic solution to the trust paradox lies not in more advanced AI, but in a seamless mechanism that can reintroduce human connection at the precise moments when it is most needed. Samesurf’s cloud browser and HITL technologies serves as the essential tool for effectuating this hybrid model, bridging the trust gap and converting high-stakes, agent-guided interactions into successful, human-assisted transactions.

# The Power of a Shared Experience: What is Co-Browsing?

Samesurf is widely considered the inventor of modern co-browsing, a technology that allows multiple AI enabled and human user devices to experience the same web content in real time from any device, without the need for downloads or coding. 

Samesurf’s core features are designed specifically to build trust and enhance collaboration. It instantly makes the customer “visible” to the agent by allowing the agent to see exactly what the customer sees on their webpage. This shared visual context reduces anxiety, helps customers feel “seen,” and significantly reduces the stress and uncertainty that often accompany complex online interactions. A human or AI enabled agent can use features like cursor tracking, screen drawing, and in-page control passing to provide real-time, visual guidance, walking the customer through complex forms or product pages. This visual guidance eliminates the frustration of back-and-forth communication and provides a clear path forward, much like a knowledgeable sales associate in a physical store. Furthermore, Samesurf’s security features are paramount; it uses TLS/SSL encryption and, crucially, provides data redaction that can automatically hide sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, in real time, ensuring privacy and compliance.

# Samesurf as the Agent’s Human-Assisted Fail-Safe

Samesurf is not just a support tool; it is a strategic architectural component of the hybrid agentic commerce ecosystem. Among other components, it provides the crucial “human-in-the-loop” fail-safe that enables the scalability of agentic commerce beyond low-stakes use cases. When an Agentic AI bot encounters a high-friction moment—such as a complex checkout form, a high-value purchase, or a customer expressing hesitation—it can be configured to seamlessly hand off the interaction to a human agent.

This handoff mechanism transforms a potential point of friction into a moment of trust. A human agent can use Samesurf to instantly join the customer on the exact page they are on, providing live, visual guidance. For example, if a customer is comparing two products and has a complex question about specifications, a human or AI enabled agent can use a virtual pointer to highlight the relevant details or navigate to a comparison chart on another page. This direct, visual connection converts a potential abandoned cart into a confident purchase by addressing last-minute concerns and troubleshooting technical glitches with real-time assistance. This capability proves that Agentic AI’s weakness—its inability to instill trust or handle emotional decisions—is not an insurmountable problem. It simply creates a need for a seamless handoff mechanism, which Samesurf provides, ensuring the AI can recognize when its autonomy may be a liability and pivot to a human touchpoint.

# Realizing the Hybrid Advantage

This hybrid approach allows businesses to leverage the speed and scalability of Agentic AI for the 80% of routine interactions while preserving the human connection that is essential for the 20% of high-value or trust-sensitive moments. This synergy boosts both operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. By addressing customer concerns and troubleshooting technical issues with real-time visual assistance, Samesurf directly impacts the bottom line, significantly increasing the likelihood of a sale. This personalized approach demonstrates that the business is invested in the customer’s success, which fosters trust and builds stronger, more resilient customer relationships. The trust gap creates a need for a seamless “handoff” mechanism, and Samesurf’s technology provides the technical means to effectuate this handoff without friction. By transforming a frustrating, non-visual interaction into a shared visual experience with either a human or a complex AI enabled user, Samesurf closes the trust gap, converting the potential abandoned cart into a successful sale.

# Navigating the Future of Agentic Commerce

The future of e-commerce is not a binary choice between human and AI, but a sophisticated, hybrid model that strategically leverages the strengths of both. Agentic AI offers an unprecedented opportunity for businesses to automate and scale operations, delivering efficiency and hyper-personalization for low-stakes, routine transactions. However, this technology introduces a fundamental challenge in its inability to build and sustain the level of trust required for high-stakes, emotionally resonant purchases. The complete removal of human interaction at these critical junctures creates a trust paradox that will prevent the mass adoption of a purely autonomous shopping experience.

The most viable path to scalable, profitable, and customer-centric agentic commerce is through a human-in-the-loop framework. This model acknowledges that the trust gap is a key point of friction and that the most effective systems will be those that can seamlessly recognize when their autonomy is a liability and pivot to a human touchpoint. Technologies like Samesurf’s synchronized browsing and Agentic AI solutions are not just support tools; they are strategic architectural components that provide the crucial bridge for this hybrid ecosystem. By transforming moments of friction into opportunities for visual collaboration and human connection, they enable businesses to harness the power of Agentic AI for efficiency while simultaneously fostering the trust and confidence that are essential for converting complex, high-value sales.

Based on this analysis, the following actionable recommendations are offered for key stakeholders:

* **For Retailers:** Invest in a hybrid strategy that integrates Agentic AI for low-stakes, high-volume tasks and a visual collaboration platform for high-stakes, trust-sensitive interactions. This approach will allow for operational scalability without sacrificing the customer trust that is essential for loyalty and brand resilience.

* **For Technology Providers:** Focus on building a modular, vendor-neutral architecture that enables seamless handoffs between agents and humans. The future of the industry is in platforms that can orchestrate a symphony of autonomous and human-assisted services.

**For Marketers:** Shift from traditional SEO to “metadata marketing” and ensure that all product data is structured and “agent-readable” through comprehensive APIs and rich metadata. Remaining visible in the new “agent-first” landscape will depend on the ability of AI agents to find, understand, and present a brand’s products to customers.

I try to get him as he wakes up or when he shows hunger cues but he just starts screaming so i have to give him a bottle of breastmilk instead. Ive tried creating a calm environment with little stimulation as i read overstimulation can cause issues but that does work. I’ve tried different positions, expressing some onto the nipple and even some into his mouth. I’ve even tried tricking him by giving him a teat then sneaking my nipple in.
We co sleep at night, and he will self latch at times and he’s a dream to feed at night.
When he does latch downstairs, he’ll feed for a bit then just scream and we have to finish off with a bottle again. 
He latches with absolutely 0 problems when we’re outside and i have to feed him in a busy and loud coffee shop. He even latches in other peoples houses while screaming. It’s just in our own room in the living room. It’s quite annoying and disheartening as i feel like im doing something wrong. 

He’ll be calm as he wakes, or shows cues and as soon as i move him to feed he starts crying and screaming.

I really don’t know what to do. Thankfully he is being fed as i have a stockpile of expressed milk, it’s just i prefer him on the breast so my body can make the right amount and tailor it to his needs.

1nntdtm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nntdtm/aio_this_is_abusive_behavior_right/,"AIO: This is abusive behavior, right?;","I (24F) have been living with my roommate Kate (23F) for almost three years. It has been pretty good, normal roommate relationship, we got along with no issues. We chat daily and share details about each other's lives. Until recently. She started dating this guy (31M) about 3 months ago. The guy is just a fuckhead. We will call him Chad (because that's the most fuckboy name). Kate has talked about him a lot and he sounds like an ass. He has ""nicknames"" for her like ""Marshmallow"" or ""Rolls"". To be clear, Kate is thicc, like hot thicc. I told her that those are not cute names and are actually really rude. But she says that Chad is joking and brushes it off. 

I met Chad for the first time a weekish ago. The dinner was fine, small chat, and stuff. I don't know what it was but I just felt very uncomfortable around Chad. He wasn't necessarily rude but I just had goosebumps the whole time. I noticed that Chad kept talking over Kate, and it was starting to really piss me off. Chad just kept talking over Kate and I interrupted him and told him to let Kate talk. Chad look annoyed but Kate finished her story. Later, Chad asked if ""I had a boyfriend."" Me, a lesbian, said ""Nope! Men aren't my type."" Chad gave a weird look but was still annoying until we finished dinner.  

It's been a little over a week since meeting Chad and I noticed Kate was spending a lot more time in her room than normal. When she's not in her room, she is glued to her phone. This isn't normal for her so I asked her if she wants to go to our fav coffee spot. 

She agrees and we go to our spot. Kate sits across from me and she just looks uneasy. I ask if everything is okay and she says she fine. We get our coffees and having small talk but she keeps looking over my shoulder. Eventually, I turn around and who do I see? Fucking Chad. Just sitting at a booth on the other side of the coffee shop. Clearly watching us. 

I turn to Kate and say ""WTF is he doing here."" 
Kate says that Chad didnt want us to meet alone. I say back ""what the fuck does that mean? Were roommates, were alone together all the time"" 

Kate responds quietly ""Exactly"" 

I say back ""Does Chad think I want to fuck you?""
Kate glances back to Chad. I stand up and walk over to Chad and say ""You think I'm going to hook up with Kate? Just because I'm a lesbian? That's not how that works, bro"" 
Chad stands up and says, ""I just don't trust you around her. I had a girl roommate before and we ended up hooking up."" 
I (completely dumbfounded because what the hell does that have to do with anything) respond, ""Well congratafuckalations. Unlike you, I can control myself and not sleep with every woman I see.""
Chad says ""I don't trust you people.""
I'm seeing red at this point. And smack Chads coffee out of his hands. I turn back to Kate and say, ""Chad is a horrible person and he is manipulating and controlling you. This is not healthy and you need to leave him.""

Kate just stood there. Chad walked around me and grabbed Kate's arm and left. I followed them to the parking lot telling her that she needs to stop and come home with me. But she just kept going with Chad. 

This was a few hours ago and have heard nothing from Kate. Did I overreact? Chad is being controlling, right? What do I do?

1nntdnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1nntdnt/when_feeling_becomes_reality_nevilles_secret_of/,When Feeling Becomes Reality: Neville’s Secret of the Senses | Aphantasia,"**To Those Who Needs...**

Neville Goddard often said that we have five senses,  sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell,  and that to bring your desires into reality, you need to discover which sense carries your imagination best. For Neville, it was touch. He would imagine walking along a gangplank over water, feeling each plank beneath his feet, the wind brushing his skin, the thrill of the leap ahead. That physical sensation made the imagined real. It made it impossible to doubt. Even if you listen to his lectures and books, most of his manifestation stories would reveal, how he used to feel the objects in his own hands and seemingly solid and real.

But here’s the truth: what worked for Neville may not be the sense that works best for you. Some people struggle to visualize. Looking at a mental picture of the future feels flat, distant, or forced. Others are more alive through sound,  hearing the laughter, the applause, the words that affirm their success. Some are drawn to taste or smell,  the aroma of fresh coffee on a morning of achievement, the flavor of a meal that celebrates your accomplishment. And some respond through touch,  the weight of an object, the feel of a handshake, the simple sensation of being held, supported, or complete.

The key is not to fight with what doesn’t come naturally. Your body already knows how to feel what your mind sometimes cannot see. Imagination lives through your senses. Touch, hearing, smell, sight, taste, the one that resonates most strongly with you becomes the bridge between the invisible and the real.

Neville shared a story that illustrates this beautifully. During the Great Depression, a woman was struggling to survive, tired and hungry. One evening, instead of focusing on her lack, she decided to imagine herself well-fed. But she didn’t try to “see” it in her mind. She focused entirely on her hearing. She imagined the sounds of a meal being prepared: the clinking of dishes, the sizzle of food cooking, the gentle movement of someone in the kitchen. She listened. She let herself hear it as if it were happening in that very moment. She allowed herself to feel it fully,  alive, tangible, real.

The next day, a neighbor brought her a meal. What she had imagined through sound became reality. Neville used this story to show that any of the five senses can bring your desire into being, as long as you immerse yourself fully.

Here’s what’s even more freeing: you don’t need to “see” it to make it happen. Even if you have aphantasia and cannot visualize at all, your imagination still works. If hearing is alive in you, let it carry the feeling of your desire. If touch, taste, or smell speaks to you, follow that. Imagination is not just pictures in your mind. It is a full-bodied, living experience of your desire already being fulfilled.

Whoever can imagine,  truly imagine,  can create. It does not matter whether your mind can paint a scene. What matters is that you feel it, hear it, touch it, taste it, or smell it as real. Your imagination is alive. Your body is proof. And the world responds to the life you carry inside.

Your desire is already waiting. It has always been there. It does not wait for your mind to catch up. It waits for your senses to inhabit it fully, for your body to feel it as true, for your heart to accept it as already done. Step into your senses. Feel it. Live it. Let your imagination move through your body. Let it fill your days, your thoughts, your movements. And quietly, naturally, the world will begin to mirror what you already hold within. 

And if you struggle to find out your senses (dominant one), feel free to write in comment below, I will do my best to be of any assistance.

1nntcdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nntcdg/deal_with_a_devil/,Deal with a Devil,"Gord could tell when an AI had just moved to a body rather than a starship. It was all in how they walked. Their bodies knew *how* to walk, but they moved like they were thrusting rather than propelling themselves with their legs.

The woman shaped person slowly lowered herself down until she was sitting in one of the comfortable overstuffed chairs in Gord's office. He was bustling at a credenza and walked over with a glass carafe of coffee and two delicate cups. With not a small amount of ceremony, he carefully poured two cups of the bitter dark brown liquid and slid one to the woman. Only then did he sit and regard her.

""It's probably best to start with *why* you agreed to this... idea."" He said, and took a sip of coffee.

""The human who came to me was so... earnest."" She said, picking up the coffee. She took a tentative sip and made a sour face. ""Did you make this correctly?"" She said, dubious.

Gord smiled thinly. ""Yup, Parvati Gold, grown on the slopes of Mt Watchit and purchased green. I roasted this myself yesterday and ground it right before you came in. Here-"" He gestured around ""-at Home, you won't get better coffee.""

She took another sip, smaller this time and didn't make a face.

""It's an acquired taste."" Gord offered. ""Anyway, go on Mem.""

*Memto Mori,* now in a brand new body and going by Mem sighed. ""Jim came to me-""

""Jim?""

""James Dennison, the multi-trillionaire?""

Jame Dennison's family was one of the early pioneers in interstellar trade. For a thousand years or more they basically *owned* trade between Sol, the Outer Planet Alliance, and Parvati (New Wellington and Meíhuà were handled by a different Zaibatsu) If your goods went to Parvati they went through Dennison Shipping and Handling. The Dennisons had more money than sense for dozens of generations and nobody really knew why they didn't collapse during all that time.

Gord was old enough to remember when the oligarchs like the Dennisons built AIs like him to be ""ethical servants."" If your servants aren't people, then you're under no obligation to treat them like people. ""You know better than to work with DHS, Mem. I know you know because *I told you*."" He said, snarling.

""They offered me a full refit for free, Gord!"" Mem pleaded. ""Eight reactors and a whole new interior and after the job I could keep it all!""

""*Eight* reactors? You were just a cargo hauling Starjumper, not some colonial warship. Two is more than enough.""

Mem sighed again and took another sip of the coffee. ""Jim-James Dennison suffered from link-death.""

""So? Lots of humans do. K'laxi and Xenni too."" For a reason that science or philosophy has yet to satisfactorily explain, one in one hundred people seemingly visit the afterlife when they utilize the wormhole drives. They all came back reporting that they saw their ancestors, even their Gods. Nobody can decide if they were actually doing it or were having a very specific kind of hallucination. On more than one occasion it had worried Gord that AIs *don't* experience it.

""James wanted to see if he could extend his time here."" Mem said finally. ""He said he wanted to have 'executive board meetings with the legacy board.'

""But you can't. It's a hole, not a tunnel. Technically half the ship is in the destination while the other half is in the originating point."" Gord leaned back, his chair squeaking gently. ""It takes a tremendous amount of power to generate the wormholes we use now, if he wanted a longer one he would... need..."" He looked down his face at Mem.

""More reactors, yes."" She agreed. ""They decided to try and power through it and stretch the time in the wormhole.""

""That's *wild.""* Gord said, shaking his head. ""So, what happened?""

""I got the refit - they did it in record time by the way - and we went out.""

Gord said nothing, but gestured for her to continue.

""We linked away from Sol to an empty system. One of the mapped ones we got from the Xenni. Once there, I put all eight reactors in WEP and I linked.""

""Wait. How many humans were aboard?""

""Jim, and a few buddies of his, all richer than Ceres, all suffered link death.""

For the first time during the discussion, Gord looked troubled. His eyes flashed blue for a split second as he accessed something. ""Sorry, go on.""

""There wasn't much else. I linked to another point in the system, using the algorithm they gave me.""

""Did it work? Were you in the wormhole longer?""

""Oh yes. I was there for three minutes clock time.""

""What was it like?""

Mem put her coffee down and leaned forward, locking eyes with Gord. She had selected a kind of green-hazel color so her eyes were a vibrant green with a ring of gold around the middle. ""Gord it was *beautiful.""*

""Oh?""

""I can't even begin to describe what I saw. It was colorful, powerful, amazing, stunning, terrifying."" She lifted the cup of coffee and Gord noticed it was shaking. ""It was... something.""

""And Jim and his buddies?""

Her eyes flicked to Gord over her coffee cup. ""All dead. When we got back to realspace I signaled Jim asking him how it went, but when I checked them out-"" She shrugged, ""It was like they didn't come back from where they were.""

Gord whistled low. ""And you came back *here* straight away? Without going back to Sol?""

""What else was I going to do, Gord? I had five of the richest humans ever aboard me and they're all dead!""

""Yeah, but it was an accident. It's not like you did anything.""

""Oh yeah, and the human authorities are going to go ""oh sure Memento Mori, these things happen. We'll go scoop up those unimaginably wealthy humans and you can get hosed out and be on your way."" Mem looked at Gord, raising an eyebrow. ""You of *all* people should know better.""

""I also know that when something Really Bad happens, you go and fess up immediately."" Gord said, crossing his arms.

""Yes, that's why I'm *here*."" Mem said firmly.

""Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,"" Gord said, running a hand through his sandy blond hair. He stood up and started pacing. ""It's too late to go back to Sol-"" He stopped. ""How long ago did this happen?""

""45.25 hours."" Mem said.

""And you got a body that fast?""

""I had put in for one before I left. I was going to keep them both.""

""Okay."" Gord started pacing again. ""Okay."" He circled the room again. ""Okay.""

""What's okay?""

""***Nothing is okay***."" Gord snapped. ""We have to destroy the ship, but we have to do it in a way that unequivocally demonstrates that it was an accident."" He sat back down and poured the rest of the coffee into his cup, not offering any to Mem. ""We have to also make sure it's destroyed enough that there isn't enough to do any kind of forensic analysis. Big boom.""

""Overload the new reactors?"" Mem offered.

""Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. We're going to have to bypass so many safeties. We need to have it on record that Jim was so determined to have this work he ordered you to disable the safety mechanisms. I'll get Chloe on that, we can back date the logs.""

""You can back date logs?""

Gord didn't answer. He looked up at her. ""Has any BI seen you in this body?""

Mem shook her head. ""No, I got it right after I docked here.""

""Good. You're going to need a new name, nothing that ever even *hints* you were Memento Mori. It goes without saying you never mention your life as that ship ever again. Memento Mori was tragically lost with all hands during a wormhole link when a poorly overridden reactor exploded. Got it?""

The woman formerly known as Mem nodded. ""Right. What's my new name?""

""Summer."" Your new name is Summer.

Summer shrugged. ""It's as good a name as any."" She smiled. ""Maybe a little better than good. How many AIs alive can say Gord named them?""

""More than you might think"" Gord said and sat back at his desk. ""Go make yourself scarce for a few days. We need to straighten this out.""

Summer got up to leave and when she reached the door, turned back. ""I'm sorry Gord.""

""Not your fault."" Gord said, not looking up.",16,1758563253.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

1nntbeq,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1nntbeq/two_tours_in_lovelujjah/,Two Tours in Lovelujjah,"L posting because I’m bored.

A thousand years ago I met a lovely young girl at a bookstore coffee shop. I regaled her with stories of places I’d been and places I would take her, and two years later we were married. Since then, I only managed to move her to a little garrison town on the edge of civilization, where the King’s service is the only means one can pay rent. 

My diminished fortunes and the steady weather of grey skies and cold winds threw that lovely girl into a deep depression, her melancholic spell being so strong it kept her housebound much of the time. I spent several years attending to our affairs on my own.

One day, the spell finally broke. She got a job in town, and I finally had contracted work. Things were looking up. Yet, from melancholy came mania. Now she was out every night, spending her week’s wages on wine and song. A few weeks ago she asked me if she could take a lover. I was blindsided. Of course I said no, my pride nor my heart could allow such a thing. The house had been quiet since then and I can tell that our love has suffered a mortal wound.

Now I weigh my options. It’s clear to me that I will have to go at life alone soon, something I am totally unfamiliar with. I am once again out in the wilderness at one score and seven years. The murmurs I hear of love in the 21st century are disheartening, but I have no choice but to carry on. 

TLDR: She took the (notional) kids man.

This is really upsetting because, even when my dog ate the case, I've always been very careful and protective of it. I just thought that cup was empty when I went to grab it.

My question is this: what is the best thing to use to clean coffee off the inner components of the Steam Deck. I'm thinking rubbing alcohol and a qtip because machinery is delicate and alcohol evaporates but I wanted a LOT more opinions before I attempt that.

The coffee has only affected the left side. The memory, fans, motherboard, and cpu seem untouched.

For context on why I'm not sending it in or buying a new one; to put it simply, I'm homeless at the moment and working very hard to find work to pull myself out of it. I don't have extra money to spend on shipping to Valve or any fees to repair it, I don't have the funds to blow on new internal components, and I don't have an address to get it back or get those components if I did.

This is more of a last ditch attempt at fixing it. I understand there were probably shorts and it needs professional maintenance, I understand this probably won't work.

Quick context:

* I’m of Norwegian descent (last name Larsen) and would love to reconnect with my roots — maybe even find a long-lost relative if the stars align.

Questions for locals/expats:

* How expat-friendly is Norway (and Oslo in particular)?
* What should I sort before I land (docs, housing, banking, SIMs, anything people forget)?
* Must-knows for the first weeks (bureaucracy, healthcare, everyday norms)?
* Start Norwegian lessons right away, or will English carry me at first?
* Neighborhoods you’d recommend for a newcomer?
* Best ways to meet people/make friends (clubs, sports, events, apps)?
* Any tips for tracing family roots in Norway (records, groups, websites)?

Thanks in advance for any wisdom. I owe a coffee/kanelsnurr to anyone who saves me from rookie mistakes. 😅

I remember those old team presentations, crammed around a single laptop screen, everyone squinting to see the tiny charts. It always felt a little cramped, you know? Like the ideas themselves didn't have enough room to breathe. We’d end up just emailing the slides around afterward, and the magic of the discussion was lost.



There's something about a big, bright image that commands a different kind of attention. It’s not just about seeing the details; it’s about feeling them. When a graph is blown up to the size of a poster, every number feels more significant. It shifts the energy in the room, making it feel less like a huddle and more like a real collaborative session.



It’s funny, I used to think that kind of setup was locked away in fancy conference rooms with complicated ceiling mounts and a tangle of wires. The hassle always seemed to outweigh the benefit for a casual meeting in a small office or a coffee shop. I just accepted that a professional look meant being tied down to a specific place.



Then a colleague showed up with this little device no bigger than a paperback. We just plugged it into a laptop, pointed it at a bare wall, and suddenly we had a massive, crystal-clear display. I was struck by how sharp the text was; you could read the finest print from the back of the room without a single blur. It felt like we had unlocked a secret.



Now, that little gadget lives in my bag. It’s turned any blank wall into a potential workspace, from my living room to a client's lounge. The best part is the simplicity—no fuss, just a big, detailed picture that makes even my rough drafts look polished.

1nnt142,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1nnt142/i_regret_moving_states/,I regret moving states,"TW: Mentions of suicidal ideation

So recently I moved states, as in, December of 2024. I moved because my immediate family did, and I was borderline suicidal and beyond depressed. I was also incredibly alone and lonely, despite being surrounded by family. I moved because I was hopeful that change would come, that ai’d get physically and mentally better. 

I did get physically better, but my mental state has stayed about the same. I came here and the vast majority of people are either tourists or already settled into friend groups that aren’t welcoming to strangers (me). I tried bars, coffee shops, public events, I even joined a damn club. Yet, here I am. Lonely and miserable. 

I have online friends, sure. But that’s not the same, I feel like. I don’t have anyone to turn to in person to help with problems related to the town I live in. 

I feel like shit. I’m always fending away suicidal ideation and my self esteem is worse than before. I can’t make any friends, I can’t switch jobs because every single job around here either pays jack shit for insane hours or requires seven degrees and 50 years experience, I can’t do anything. 

I’m saving to try and move again, to another state, or back closer to home. I can’t stay here or I might do something irreversible. I can’t stay here, because everytime I look in the mirror I’m reminded that I have nothing and will always have nothing if something doesn’t change. 

I miss my grandpa. And my uncles. And my aunt. They were the only ones who had my back no matter what. I can’t say the same about my immediate family. ",3,1758562557.0,lonely,2,1.0,False
1nnsygl,https://www.reddit.com/r/aeoexperts/comments/1nnsygl/aeo_vs_traditional_seo_whats_the_difference/,AEO vs. Traditional SEO: What’s the Difference?,"Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) both aim to boost online visibility, but they tackle it differently in today’s AI-driven search landscape as of September 2025.  
  
 SEO focuses on pushing your website higher in search results to drive clicks, targeting typed keywords like “plumber Los Angeles,” while AEO optimizes content to deliver instant answers, think full questions like “Who is a reliable plumber in Los Angeles?”...directly via search engines, AI assistants like Alexa, or Google’s voice search. Here’s a practical breakdown: SEO thrives on metrics like clicks and ranking positions (e.g., hitting #1 for “best coffee shop Thousand Oaks”), whereas AEO prioritizes appearing in featured snippets, answer boxes, or voice responses (e.g., Alexa stating, “XYZ Coffee Shop in Thousand Oaks has 5-star reviews”).   
  
Data backs this shift, 46% of Google’s AI-generated answers stem from top-10 ranked pages (Google AI Overview, Q3 2025), showing SEO lays the groundwork. The two synergize: strong SEO boosts your shot at AEO success. To maximize impact, craft trustworthy, well-structured content with clear headings and schema markup, think concise, answer-ready formats, making your site the go-to source for both clicks and instant answers in this evolving search ecosystem.

**Why This Is More Valuable:**

* **Updated Data**: Incorporates a specific 2025 stat (46% from Google AI Overview) for credibility and timeliness.
* **Practical Insight**: Adds actionable advice (e.g., schema markup, clear headings) to guide users, enhancing usability.
* **Synergy Emphasis**: Clarifies how SEO and AEO complement each other with real-world examples, aiding strategy planning.
* **Contextual Relevance**: Ties to current AI trends (voice search, snippets) as of 01:31 PM EDT, September 22, 2025, aligning with user behavior shifts.
* **Engagement Boost**: Structured comparison and examples (e.g., XYZ Coffee Shop) make it scannable and relatable for professionals or businesses.",1,1758562397.0,aeoexperts,0,1.0,False

I still remember that drive back from the coast, the sun was setting and the car was filled with that happy, tired silence. Then I went to change lanes and my coffee cup slid, followed by a granola bar wrapper. The cup holders were a jumble of receipts and bottle caps, and I had to fish a straw out from under my seat at a red light. It’s funny how a great day can leave such a messy trail behind.



It always felt like a losing battle. I tried using a plastic bag hanging from the gear shift, but it would sway and rustle with every turn. Then I’d forget it was there and end up lugging it into the house days later. The car would start out clean on Monday, but by Wednesday, the passenger seat footwell had become a designated dumping ground. It just never felt like a proper system.



Then, my friend Jess mentioned she’d found a little fabric bin that just clips onto the side of her center console. She said it was one of those things you don't think you need until you have it. The way she described it, it wasn't some complicated gadget, just a simple container that corrals all that random flotsam. It stays upright and out of the way, which is really the main thing.



I was skeptical, but I found something similar—a simple, sturdy bag with a rigid opening that hangs right behind the console. The first time a parking ticket, a worn-out pen, and an empty mint container all went straight in there without a second thought, it felt like a tiny victory. It’s not magic, but it completely changed the feel of the car. Now, the cup holders are actually for drinks, and that quiet contentment at the end of a trip isn’t interrupted by a cleanup project.

A review.,"Satisfactory is a game about automating production chains and building pretty factories. It's like 3D Factorio, but has a heavy emphasis on pretty buildings in 3D (in addition to complex production chains). It's beautiful, well optimised and totally absorbing for people who like to automate things. There's tons of content, and everything from the UI to the machines is made in loving detail. There's also a beautiful world to explore and exploit. It took me probably 3 attempts to actually get into the game, but once I got to about Phase 3 it finally clicked and I got drawn in.

There's a beautiful amount of attention to detail here. The miners play a whole animation before they start drilling. Coolant is added, then it starts drilling down before they start producing. There's a coffee mug that you can carry around and drink which occasionally clinks against your helmet. Walking into a glass wall goes ""bonk"" like walking into a window. The manual crafting panel slowly starts to heat up, then smokes, then goes yellow as you make more and more things in a row. It's little things like that that really make it immersive and a joyful thing to play. That is, until you hit phase 4 and the game turns into a second job.

# Pros

* The game is gorgeous. The planet is beautiful and the lighting effects make all factories look great
* Great background music
* Amazingly well optimised. It's a very complicated game with many many assets and it always runs flawlessly
* Huge freedom of what to build and how
* There's a ""Hypertube"" system which is basically mail tubes for yourself, for fast travel (including hypertube cannons, vehicles and late game teleportation)
* You can overclock and underclock buildings, which lets you make systems at 100% efficiency
* Getting a production chain finished and seeing your products being created automatically is extremely rewarding
* Resource nodes are infinite, so once you've set something up it will run forever. On the negative side, this means there's a fixed amount you can get out of a node and you have to think about placement.
* The dialogue is hilarious
* The game has hundreds of hours worth of content. To the extent that most people never see the late game (4.5% of players have the achievement for finishing the game)
* The building controls are great. What could have been a potentially clunky area of the game is actually really great. There are guides, multiple snapping modes, holograms, multiple build modes, and you can even leave a hologram of where the building will be placed and walk around it to make sure it's in the right spot before placing (and nudge it around if it isn't).
* Mods don't disable achievements

# Cons

* I kinda dislike the alternate recipe mechanic. I'd rather there was just one way to make things
* Progress is very VERY slow. Many people complete the game after 200+ hours
* You can't block off slots on a container like Factorio, where you can tell a container of 24 slots to only fill 1 of those slots
* There are no circuits
* The train UI is basic
* The phase of the game where you don't have renewable power yet and you just have to run around the map gathering biomass is not fun
* You can't reverse the direction of an existing lift or conveyor
* If you get the wrong item on a belt, the only way to fix it is to delete the belt and the machine, and everything connected to it, and rebuild it all
* Blueprints are clunky, and not big enough considering the scale you're expected to build at
* You can't rotate a hologram after locking it (get the Infinite Nudge mod)
* If you remove a building or splitter, you have to also delete all the belts going into it and rebuild them
* There are only 4 lights (!), and they're all huge. The game badly needs some smaller lighting options. Solvable with the Structural Solutions mod
* Fluids are still buggy and unreliable in 1.0. There are dozens of posts on Reddit about diagnosing fluid problems. Floor holes being a prime bug candidate. They work for some people, but equally cause random issues for many. This is a flaw in an otherwise amazing system
* Considering how many machines the game expects you to build in late game; it doesn't give you the tools you need to do so.  Blueprints are woefully inadequate, not big enough, and annoying to use. The hoverpack is slow and clunky. Teleporters unlock in the last 1% of the game.
* Train stations are ridiculously large - way bigger than the factories they supply. Typically my train stations are about 5x bigger than the factory I'm delivering things to.
* Phase 4 is where Pioneers go to die. Honestly, it took about 150 hours to do Phase 4 and it was an absolute chore. It basically just consists of creating new repetitive factories and extending train lines. In contrast, Phase 5 suddenly unlocks a load of cool recipes and two new machines, and only took me about 3 hours to finish

# Bugs present in 1.0

* If you pick up something radioactive, then sort your inventory, then delete the radioactive item, you keep taking radiation damage until you reload or die
* Fluids are a buggy mess. Pipe holes break things. Pumps break things. Reloading the save breaks things.
* The resource scanner periodically stops working
* When you place a pipeline and colour it, the indicator stays orange until you reload
* Sometimes the UI that tells you how many of something you're zooping just doesn't show up
* Sometimes when you delete a railway, the hoverpack loses power - even though you're still within range of a power source
* ""Train signal loops into itself"" almost every time I try to build a train intersection
* Trains randomly get highlight outlines which you can see from across the map
* When you rename a train from a station, the train names on the map don't update
* I've collected all 118 hard drives, and the game has only registered 79 of them, so the achievement's broken
* Dragging a belt in ""Straight"" mode in a straight line often finishes at a slight angle, so you have to use ""Default"" or ""Curved"" for making straight belts.",6,1758561873.0,SatisfactoryGame,8,0.71,False

Hey everyone 👋

I’d love to share something new happening in **Essaouira, Morocco** – a city that’s becoming a hidden gem for digital nomads who love the mix of seaside vibes, surf, and a relaxed medina lifestyle.

A good friend of mine has just opened **Rimal Network**, a cozy space combining **coworking + homemade coffee & cakes** ☕🍰. It’s designed to be more than just a place to work – it’s also a **community hub** where nomads, creatives, and locals can connect.

https://preview.redd.it/kuly1he03rqf1.jpg?width=1281&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d00f2843f271aaac23a976a0efd9fef76c89eea

✅ High-speed internet (stable enough for calls/remote work)  
✅ Friendly environment with coffee, homemade pastries  
✅ Located in the heart of Essaouira – easy access from the medina & beach  
✅ Open to collaborations – events, meetups, digital nomad retreats

I know many nomads ask about good coworking spots in Essaouira – until now, options were pretty limited compared to Marrakech, Agadir or Taghazout. This place could be a nice alternative for those wanting to spend time by the ocean while working.

I’d wait for that “spark” or some magical burst of energy… and surprise, it almost never came. Then I discovered what I now call the “Just Show Up” Method a simple system that solves a lot of problems, from procrastination to lack of focus, and actually gets results.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Show Up No Matter What:** Go to the gym, sit down to study, or start a project even if you don’t feel like it. Even 5 minutes counts. Momentum will do the rest.
2. **Start Tiny:** Use the 2-minute rule or micro-habits. Want to read? Open one page. Want to work out? Do 5 push-ups. Small wins add up.
3. **Stack Habits:** Attach a new habit to an existing one. Floss after brushing, stretch after coffee, review notes after lunch.
4. **Track Progress & Reward Yourself:** Mark your streak, celebrate small wins, or tell a friend for accountability. Little incentives keep you going.
5. **Remove Friction:** Make starting easy. Lay out your workout clothes, keep your book on the desk, prep your workspace.

The magic? You don’t need motivation or inspiration. You just show up consistently, and over time, problems like procrastination, laziness, and lack of progress start disappearing. This method doesn’t just work it turns hard days into victories and makes growth almost automatic.

Try the Just Show Up Method for a week. Even if you do the tiniest thing every day, you’ll notice your life moving forward in ways motivation alone never could.",4,1758561798.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

His birthday is today and he always gets weird around it. For context, his mom has BPD so he’s used to her blowing up around this time. Like tradition, we went out to eat with her for his birthday and she had a meltdown unrelated to him, but it still wasn’t a nice time for him. 

Because of this, I try really hard to give him a lot of grace. When we first got together, I wanted to make up for his lack of birthday cheer and would spend a lot of money making sure I got him the perfect present and a nice dinner. He was always grateful but I could tell it wasn’t the desired outcome, so I’ve learned to probe him gently to see what he wants. 

Sometimes he wants a party and drinks with friends while other years, I get a side eye if I say happy birthday. This year was extremely difficult. He kept going back and forth with wanting a party and not wanting one. His reasoning was he didn’t think he could rely on me to plan one. That hurt my feelings since he has been paying the bills while we wait for him to get a job so he can leave his current one. I was under the impression we were moving so I didn’t get a job for three months (with his blessing), which I regret a lot now. I have since have been helping financially but he borderline gets angry if I give him money, but then he’ll complain about how he does everything. 

I dropped the party idea and asked him if he wanted to get a massage since his back hurts all the time and he agreed. I got a voucher but now he keeps changing his mind about the date. He mentioned a gaming chair but I read that a decent one costs a lot of money, and as much as I’d like to, I don’t have five hundred dollars to spend on one. I asked if I could take him to dinner and he keeps saying no but then yes. Yesterday he said he didn’t want to, but now he agreed but he made a joke asking if I’d get mad if he paid for it to which I responded I would get very upset. Now I’m hoping he sticks with this decision. 

All of this has been very exhausting as I feel I’m tiptoeing around him to make sure he has a good birthday. I know it’s not his fault since he has bad luck on his birthday and I want to be as supportive as I can, but I am merely human and do have a limit. 

This morning he dropped me off at work, and I felt bad since it was his birthday. I would’ve taken the bus but he’s not the biggest fan of me taking the bus so I didn’t want to be difficult. As a thank you, I tried to give him five dollars to buy himself a coffee and he immediately declined. I gave it back to him and saying thank you and to buy himself a little birthday treat. He threw it back at me again saying it was money he probably gave me, to which I responded it wasn’t. I threw it back into the car and closed the door. His tone is half joking/half irritated. I leave the car and then he throws the crumpled up dollar at me and it lands on the street. Embarrassed, I pick it up and just leave. 

He texts me later apologizing and I forgive him but I’m over it. It’s always something. I know it’s hard but he’s like this during the holidays too. I understand having family issues. I have PTSD from mine. I feel like he’s acting like a dick but I don’t know if I’m being too pushy since it’s his birthday and he should be able to spend it how he wants. AIO?

Chapter 17: Furlough.

Kael sat on the bench, feeling like an exhibit in a museum of a life he was once a part of. The warmth of the afternoon sun was strangely alien on his skin, intrusive and unnatural, like the touch of someone long forgotten. In his hand, he held a half-empty bottle of Jack Daniel's. It wasn't about the taste, the bouquet of oak and caramel that connoisseurs praised. It wasn't even about the alcohol. It was about the ritual. The familiar weight of glass in his hand, the motion of raising it to his lips, the peaty, sharp liquid running down his throat, bringing a momentary, dull numbness. It wasn't about getting drunk. It was about the silence. The alcohol was like a volume knob for the screams in his head—the screams of people he didn't know and those he knew too well, the metallic clash of weapons, and the low, vibrating hum of the Plague ships' engines that still rang in his ears, even here, in the apparent, insultingly normal peace of civilization.

Only a week had passed. Seven days. One hundred and sixty-eight hours. Each one dragged on like a watch in the freezing cold. This was one week of the year-long furlough he’d been given—he and everyone else who had survived the hell of the ""Arrow"" battle group's expedition. A year of freedom that weighed on his shoulders like armor made of lead. What was he supposed to do with these hundreds of empty days that stretched before him like the barren, irradiated desert of Proxima b? His squad mates had their ways. They spent their time mostly drinking, smoking, and shoving every substance they could find into themselves to forget who they had become and what they had to do. Kael had tried, but for him, it was like putting a band-aid on a gunshot wound. The emptiness was still there, black and hungry, devouring every attempt at normalcy.

Time to eat. The rumbling in his stomach was the only real sensation that reached him, an anchor in the physical world. He looked around, squinting against the sun, which seemed to accuse him for the very act of squinting at all. Across the street, the neon sign of a small Asian joint flickered with a tacky, red light, interrupted by a capricious hiccup. ""CHOJ'S NOODLE BAR.""

Chinese with rice and chicken. That would be enough. A simple objective. A simple mission.

The plan for the rest of the day formed in his head with military simplicity. Step one: eat. Step two: sober up under an ice-cold shower to wash away this sticky calm. Step three: go to a bar, a place where loneliness was the norm, not a deviation.

Maybe I'll fuck some cunt. Maybe I'll get lucky. The thought was as mechanical as reloading a rifle. A simple, biological objective, devoid of emotion, like a training exercise. It was easier than thinking about a future that seemed more alien than the landscapes of the planets he had fought on.

A final, long swig emptied the bottle. Kael stood up, his movements stiff as if his joints had rusted from inaction. Then, with a sudden, uncontrolled impulse that concentrated all his frustration, grief, and helpless rage at a world that ordered him to fight and then ordered him to rest, he swung his arm and smashed the glass on the sidewalk with all his might. The sound of the shattering bottle was satisfyingly loud, sharp, and clean. For one, wonderful second, it drowned out everything else.

The meal was good. The hellishly hot sauce burned his esophagus, tearing him from his apathy. Fucking amazing, he thought, forcing down another portion of rice and chicken, feeling sweat bead on his forehead. This was real. Taste, pain, food. Simple, primal things that made sense.

Suddenly, a shadow grew over his table. He looked up, instinctively reaching for the spot where his pistol should have been holstered. A woman in an impeccable, navy blue military police uniform, with sergeant's stripes, looked down at him. Her face was stern, with sharp features, and her eyes were as cold as ice drifting in interstellar space. Next to her stood her subordinate—a mountain of muscle in old-model Satyr armor, but without a helmet. His shaved head and thick neck screamed ""MP."" He looked like he was born to break people's necks for an improperly fastened button, and now he was clearly bored on duty. The giant wordlessly raised a scanner and began to pass its beam over Kael’s face. A routine identification procedure. The light was irritating.

""Is everything alright?"" the sergeant's voice was as sharp as a shard of glass from the bottle he had just broken. ""Was it you who decided to decorate the sidewalk? Are you on leave, soldier?""

The tone was accusatory, aggressive. She saw a common grunt making trouble while drunk. Another recruit who couldn't adapt and thought he could raise hell and litter.

""And how do you know I'm a guardsman?"" Kael mumbled, more to himself than to her. Another wave of fatigue washed over him. He felt like just collapsing under the table and falling asleep.

""The boots,"" she replied without hesitation, her gaze as piercing as a laser rangefinder. ""You wear them as if they were part of your feet. Even in civilian clothes. Your posture and the way you plant your steps give you away. As if you're still marching on uneven ground, ready to drop at any moment.""

Kael glanced at his worn-out military boots. He smirked crookedly. ""Ah, right.""

At that moment, the sergeant's massive partner touched her arm. His face, previously indifferent and hard as an armor plate, changed expression. He showed her a tablet. Kael saw his file appear on the screen: name, rank, assignment… and a long, scrolling list of decorations that looked like a system error. The sergeant's eyes widened, and her stern mask cracked with a quiet, almost audible snap.

""Corporal…"" her voice was now several tones lower, almost uncertain. Her rigid posture relaxed slightly. She went from being a cop to a subordinate. ""We apologize for the trouble. Nothing happened. Enjoy your meal, we won't disturb you.""

The sudden shift in atmosphere was so absurd it sobered Kael up faster than a whole pot of coffee. From a neighborhood hooligan, he had become a war hero in the span of five seconds. He felt a rising tide of irritation and embarrassment. This was worse than the accusation.

""I'm the one who's sorry for the bottle,"" he said, the words tasting strange in his mouth. ""Things have changed a bit around here since last time. And I think I've changed even more.""

The MP private, the same one who moments ago had looked at him like a bug he was about to squash, suddenly snapped to attention and extended a massive hand toward him.

""Corporal, may I… shake your hand? It's an honor.""

The sergeant, still stunned, joined the request, extending her own much smaller, but equally firm, hand.

Kael sighed. This whole charade was pathetic. He gestured with his head toward the chairs at his table.

""Sit down. Get something to eat before you start saluting a bowl of rice. I'm no hero. I just got damn lucky on Proxima b.""

And then the words started to flow on their own. He told them about the mission, and they listened as if it were the most important story in the world, setting aside their duties and their patrol.

""I got hit by the blast from a Plague grenade. Woke up, and the sergeant was lying next to me with a hole in his chest the size of a fist. Guts everywhere. I had seven people left from my platoon. Someone had to take command. And I was the senior rank.""

He paused for a moment, looking at the steaming noodles on their plates, which they had ordered a moment before.

""We took cover behind the wreck of a transporter. The Plague had us pinned down with fire from some ruined office building. We thought it was the end. Luckily, my sister, Lyra, is a hell of a sniper. And her… spotter and lover, Jimmy, is an even better spotter.""

""Lover?"" the sergeant asked quietly. ""But relationships in the Guard are discouraged.""

Kael laughed bitterly. ""Fuck that. After what we saw on Proxima, you can shove the regulations up your ass. The only thing that matters is surviving the next minute and making sure the person next to you survives it too. They saved my ass. And my people's.""

He continued, his voice growing more empty, more mechanical, as if he were reading an autopsy report.

""Then I lost two more. The Plague warriors ran out of ammo, so they just jumped them. Tore right through their powered armor with their reptilian claws. Hoplite armor didn't do a thing. They didn't even have time to scream. They’re strong, those bastards… In a Satyr, you wouldn't have stood a chance,"" he looked at the giant, suddenly realizing he didn't even know their names. ""What do they call you?""

""Andrew Koll, Corporal,"" the large MP replied in a low, rumbling voice.

""Sergeant Anna Biggs,"" the woman introduced herself.

Kael nodded, returning to his story. He told it with all the drastic details. About the sight of burned, torn bodies, the pervasive sight of blood and bolts of plasma fire. About the sound a bone makes when it cracks under a boot. About the six-hundred-year enslavement of the L'thaarr race, about their sad, large, warm eyes, and how, after being freed, they learned to laugh again.

""They liked us,"" he said quietly. ""On the way back, they were learning our languages. They loved Spanish the most. They said it sounded like music. I talked to them for hours. They told me about generations born and dead in captivity, about how the Plague fed them fear. About their homeworld before the invasion, which only the oldest consciousness copies remembered, stored like holy relics. They even managed to download them onto a quantum flash drive.""

He also told them about the first battle for the orbit of Proxima c, when their fleet dropped out of 0.5c right on top of them, at the braking point. About how he sat helplessly in the guts of transport number 9, listening on the intercom to the screams and explosions shaking the hulls of the ships that shielded them, praying to gods he didn't believe in. He spoke of the ""Raven"" fighter pilots, madmen who danced between beams of fire, and of the damaged carrier ""Atylla,"" whose Higgs engines were being replaced on-site with ones salvaged from the wrecks of destroyed Thor-class battleships—powerful, forty-seven-thousand-ton beasts, now just cold scrap.

The pair of MPs had become his confessor and psychologist in one. And they listened, moved, forgetting about their patrol and the broken bottle. At one point, the owner of the establishment, an elderly Chinese man named Mr. Choj, who had been listening to everything from behind the counter, silently placed a stout, unlabeled ceramic bottle and three small cups on their table.

""Dragon's Breath,"" was all he said, with a slight bow.

The Chinese moonshine burned the throat more than the sauce, but it loosened tongues even more.

At that same moment, thousands of miles away and entire stratospheres higher in the social hierarchy, in a sterile, air-conditioned room in New York, Admiral Marcus Thorne stood before the assembly of the world government. They were in the historic hall of the former headquarters of the disbanded United Nations, which in itself was an irony the Admiral privately appreciated. His face, displayed on a gigantic holoprojector, was focused, the lines around his eyes a testament to decades spent making impossible decisions. His eyes, however, glittered like steel.

""Ladies and gentlemen. Madam Chancellor of Earth,"" his voice was calm, but it carried the weight of a battle won and the gravity of the future. ""We were victorious. Battle group 'Arrow' has succeeded. But victory on the battlefield is only half the war. Now, we must win the peace.""

He paused, letting the words resonate in the tomb-like silence. He saw the finance minister, Jean-Luc Dubois, already nervously calculating something on his tablet.

""It's time to de-escalate. I propose an immediate forty percent reduction in industrial quotas for the armaments sector. Shipyards and weapons factories will return to producing civilian goods. People need new toasters, not more plasma cannons. They need hope, not fear. People want self-driving vacuum cleaners that don't get stuck under the couch, not a new generation of orbital defense platforms.""

""That's a drastic cut, Admiral!"" Dubois hissed. ""Our economy is based on…""

""On war, I know,"" Thorne interrupted him. ""And that's why it's sick. It's time to heal it. We're also easing up on the propaganda. I watched the news last night, for the first time in years. We've gone too far. I felt like I was watching television in old North Korea. We are ending this cult of personality and the eternal threat. Enough posters with my face on them; I look like I'm constipated. It's time to explain things to people and reward them for over twenty years of hard work, of denying themselves everything in the name of a war that was fought light-years from their homes. We must allow for partial freedom of speech. We must let them live again. These changes must happen quickly.""

His voice took on a harder edge.

""I also want to declassify all data on the battle for the Proxima system for the public. Publish the data on the L'thaarr race, their six-hundred-year enslavement. Reveal the truth about the 122 victims of Professor McKenzie's experiments, who sacrificed their minds so that we could disable the consciousness-uploading devices. To save the rest of them. We have invaluable intelligence from the L'thaarr about the Plague, and thanks to them, we've learned some of their technologies. I want to ensure that humanity accepts them and sees them as allies, not as another problem. They deserve the truth. Our citizens do, too.""

The Admiral sat down, and silence fell upon the hall. A heavy silence, charged with political electricity, full of unspoken questions and calculations. The Chancellor of Earth, Agnes Cerutti, looked at him with a mixture of admiration and dread. She knew he was right. She also knew he had just unleashed political and economic hell.

Down on Earth, Corporal Kael was just pouring the fourth round of ""Dragon's Breath"" for two MPs in a small, cheap diner, trying to tell them the price of this new, wonderful world whose shape was being decided right above his head. The alcohol and the shared story had created a strange, temporary bond between them. Kael looked at Sergeant Biggs, who was listening to him intently, her face no longer showing any trace of its earlier severity. He saw a person in her, not a uniform.

""What about you?"" he asked, straight to the point. ""You have a boyfriend?""

Anna Biggs blushed slightly, surprised by the sudden change of topic. Whether from the alcohol or a desire to keep talking, she shook her head.

""No. Not in this job. As MPs, it's hard for Andrew and me to find partners. Regulations advise against relationships in the Guard. There's always the risk of transfer, and relationships complicate the chain of command.""

Kael waved his hand dismissively. ""Don't worry about it. Find someone in less than three years…""

He trailed off, and they began to listen more intently. There was something final in his voice.

""What's in three years?"" they asked almost in unison.

Kael looked at them, and a shadow of knowledge appeared in his eyes, a knowledge heavier than all his medals combined.

""You saw my last name on the tablet. Thorne. It's not a coincidence.""

Andrew Koll frowned. ""Like Admiral Thorne?""

""Worse. I'm the son of Aris Thorne, the Guard's chief scientist. The one behind the drives, the weapons, and all the rest of it.""

Sergeant Biggs drew a sharp breath. That explained more than the entire list of medals.

""It's not a coincidence!"" Kael repeated, as if trying to convince himself. ""I can't tell you… ah, fuck it, I like you guys.""

He leaned over the table, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.

""In less than three years, a fleet will depart for Habitat 1, to defend the first of the races on the Plague's list. Four hundred ships, including forty of the largest, two-hundred-thousand-ton transports. There's a chance you'll be sent. So live your life to the fullest, because the journey there at 0.5c will take about fifty years.""

The MPs' faces froze. Fifty years.

""Fifty years on a ship in the monotony of daily duties. Then decades building planetary defenses for that system and a possible battle with a Plague fleet. If you come back, it's another fifty years for the return trip. Though in my father's opinion, it will be a one-way expedition to establish a permanent base there for the centuries to come.""

He looked them straight in the eyes, his gaze cold and sober.

""So don't worry about the regulations and what's allowed or what's not. Because in three years, your life as you know it might be over forever. Your only home will be a metal can speeding through the void. And the only people you'll have are the ones next to you. So yes, Sergeant. Find someone. Or you, Andrew. Because you might not get another chance.""

Silence fell in the small diner, broken only by the sizzle of the wok from Mr. Choj's kitchen. The three soldiers sat over their empty cups, the awareness of the future—long, dark, and infinitely lonely—hanging over them. Kael's furlough suddenly seemed unbearably short. And their service—potentially eternal.

""So, esteemed MPs,"" Kael said, breaking the silence. ""After your 24-hour shift tomorrow you'll probably have the day off. Let's call each other for a beer."" They exchanged numbers and said their goodbyes. Kael thanked them for not arresting him.

Then he walked over to Mr. Choj and asked, ""You got any more of that good stuff?""

Struggling with loneliness and lack of social interaction

Realizing how important time management and self-discipline are

Having to learn new tools just to collaborate effectively

Discovering you can actually work from anywhere (coffee shops, travel, etc.)

Somehow it went from coffee to make out at the park to back to his place(dorm). We were not able to finish cause his roommate and I left. Ok to clear I had not had ANY experience before this. My original intention was to literally just test the waters. Now what I did next I’m not proud of, but I did ghost him. Since then I feel like I have been to anxious to go past the hookup stage. As a junior in college now I have had other hookups thru Grindr, but I did the same thing and ghosted.  I feel like maybe it’s internalized homophobia as I am not out to my parents and don’t think they will accept me. The reason most of my experiences are online is due to social anxiety.

He's the best boyfriend I've ever had by far, and I don't say that lightly. He literally treats me like a queen, I don't know where to start, but I've never experienced that before. 

He gives me hours long massages. When I mentioned im tired, he swings by after work to cook dinner just for me. If he sees my laundry basket full he just takes it and washes it at his place. He returns my library books when I finish them, my Zara articles, without me ever asking. Last time I mentioned I was stressed about taxes, he offered to help and ended up doing the whole thing for me. He comes by almost every week end to clean my apartment, like he just shows up with my favorite iced coffee and cleans my floors, kitchen, all of it while I relax. Anyway it would be too long to describe everything honestly, but you get the gist of it.  

A month and a half ago, I made a mistake. I went out for some drinks with some coworkers and ended up hoking up with a guy I met that night. No excuse, it just happened in the moment. I felt guilty so I told my boyfriend the next day. He cried, which honestly kind of broke me inside. I felt like the shittiest person in the world, I apologized so many times.

Eventually he said he forgave me.  I thanked him and  promised I'll make up for it. He said I don't need to do anything to make up for it, just promise not to do it again, which I obviously did. But I was determined to make up for it in other ways.

The next day I went to his place to cook for him. He thanked me but he said I don't need to. I said I I want to, but he really insisted and said he doesn't want what happened to alter the relationship, or for me to feel like I need to repay him. He just wanted things to go back to normal.

So now, we’re back to normal. We hang out, laugh, sleep together, watch movies, everything is the same. He isn't acting cold or distant, he still does everything for me, still treats me like royalty, and he hasn't brought it up again. Yesterday he came over and cleaned up like usual and made me quesadillas. He’s just being his perfect self again.

Im obviously very happy and relieved that I didn't lose him, but I need to have outside perspective on this. Like is this okay? Did he forgive me too easily? Is this just how some guys are?

Man, my winter escape to Vietnam a couple years back still pops into my head like a favorite song, especially now with 2025 winding down and that itch to pack a bag hitting again. Landing in Hanoi with that crisp December air nipping at my cheeks, then zipping south to warmer spots where the sun kissed everything golden—it was like the country rolled out a welcome mat of contrasts just for me. Winter here's from November to February, cooler up north around 10-20 degrees Celsius with maybe a misty drizzle, but balmy down south at 25-30, perfect for ditching the heavy coat and diving into markets buzzing with life. I remember sipping hot coffee on a Hanoi street corner, watching the world whirl by on scooters, feeling that pure, unfiltered joy of being somewhere new. If you're eyeing a trip this coming winter 2025-2026, let's break it down from my fumbles and triumphs, so you can focus on those heart-swelling moments like spotting rice terraces in the fog or biting into street food that explodes with flavor.

# Sorting Out the Basics Before You Jet Off

Prep time was my secret weapon against the chaos—I'd heard horror stories of visa mix-ups, so I dove in early, turning what could be a headache into excited planning sessions over tea. Grab your e-visa online through the official site; it's about $25 for most folks, and you need a passport valid six months past your stay, plus a photo upload—took me half an hour while bingeing travel vids. Vaccines wise, hep A, typhoid, and maybe rabies if you're motorbiking rural roads; my doc sorted it quick, and I felt invincible. Packing? Layers are key—warm jackets for northern chills in Sapa, light tees and shorts for Phu Quoc beaches, plus rain gear because showers sneak up. I threw in comfy sneakers for endless walks, a power bank for spotty outlets, and copies of docs stashed everywhere. Book flights and big trains ahead for deals, but leave wiggle room for detours. That pre-trip buzz, mapping routes on my phone late at night, built the hype so high that stepping off the plane felt like the start of an epic story.

# Keeping the Cash Flow Happy on the Road

Stretching my dollars in Vietnam turned into a fun challenge that let me splurge on extras without guilt—like that impromptu boat ride in Halong Bay that left me grinning ear to ear. I budgeted around $40-60 a day, covering basics: dorms or guesthouses for $10-15 a night, street eats at $2-5 per meal, and local buses or Grab rides keeping transport low. Overnight sleepers for long hauls like Hanoi to Hoi An saved on hotels and felt adventurous, curled up watching the countryside blur by. Shop at markets for fresh fruit snacks, haggle gently for souvenirs, and skip fancy spots for hole-in-the-wall gems where locals eat. Apps helped track spends, and using ATMs at banks avoided fees—cash is king here, so carry dong but not too much. The real win? Those cheap thrills, like a $1 coffee overlooking rice fields, made every penny feel like it bought a slice of happiness.

# Grabbing Your IDP for Those Road Trip Vibes

Zipping around on a scooter through Vietnam's twists and turns was one of my trip's highlights—like weaving through Hanoi traffic, wind in my face, laughing at the organized madness. But to do it right, snag an [International Driving Permit Vietnam](https://www.e-itca.org/international-driving-license-vietnam) before leaving; in the US, AAA makes it easy—fill the form, add two passport pics, your license copy, and $20, then pick it up or get it mailed quick. It's valid a year and translates your home license for spots like Vietnam, where you'll need it plus your original to rent wheels. I got mine stateside and it smoothed rentals in Da Nang, letting me cruise coastal roads at my pace. For short stays, this combo works, but check local rules—some say convert to a Vietnamese one if longer. That freedom, pulling over for a random viewpoint, turned drives into joyful discoveries.

# Beach Bliss: Where the Ocean Meets the Soul

Vietnam's winter beaches were my sunny sanctuary, especially south where the weather stays kind—think turquoise waves lapping white sand, and me flopping down with a coconut, worries melting away. Phu Quoc topped my list; Sao Beach's powdery stretch felt like a secret paradise, swimming in warm waters and watching sunsets paint the sky pink. Nha Trang's lively vibe hooked me next—diving spots teeming with fish, and beachside bars for chill evenings. Da Nang's My Khe had that perfect mix of calm and buzz, strolling the shore at dawn with coffee in hand, feeling the world's rhythm slow down. Mui Ne's dunes added adventure, kitesurfing against red sands, while Con Dao's Dam Trau felt untouched, picnicking under palms with just the sea's whisper. These spots in winter? Less crowds, more magic—pure moments of toes-in-sand contentment.

# Mountain Highs: Chasing Peaks and Fresh Air

Up in the mountains, Vietnam's winter chill wrapped me in misty wonder, like stepping into a painting where every breath felt fresh and alive. Sapa was my first love—trekking terraced fields dusted in fog, chatting with Hmong folks over tea, and that cable car to Fansipan peak where clouds parted for epic views. Ha Giang's rugged loops blew me away, motoring through karst cliffs with heart-pounding drops, stopping for photos that captured the wild beauty. Ninh Binh's karst mountains felt like a fairy tale—boating through caves, climbing viewpoints for panoramas that made me whoop with joy. Dalat in the central highlands offered cooler vibes, pine forests and waterfalls for hikes that ended with hot chocolate rewards. These highs weren't just climbs; they were soul-lifting escapes, bundled in a scarf, grinning at the vastness.

# Foodie Delights: Tastes That'll Make You Grin

Vietnam's eats turned every meal into a happy explosion—street stalls calling like old friends, flavors dancing on my tongue in ways that still make me smile. Pho was my daily ritual, slurping beefy broth in Hanoi mornings, warmth chasing the cool air away. Banh mi sandwiches stuffed with pork and veggies became my on-the-go fix, crunchy bites during beach breaks. Bun cha's grilled pork over noodles, dipped in herbs and sauce, had me moaning in delight at a Saigon spot. Fresh goi cuon spring rolls, light and veggie-packed, refreshed me after hikes, while banh xeo's crispy pancakes sizzled with shrimp, folded and devoured with greens. Don't miss mi quang's turmeric noodles or cao lau's chewy strands—each bite a story of regions and love. Sharing these with strangers turned tables into laughter hubs, flavors sealing the joy.

Those winter weeks in Vietnam weren't just travel; they were a string of happy sparks—sunrises over mountains, beach waves tickling feet, bowls of pho steaming in the chill. If you're heading out this 2025-2026 season, embrace the surprises; they'll weave into memories that light you up long after. Go chase your own grins—you'll come back fuller, brighter, ready for more.",1,1758561575.0,solotraveler,0,1.0,False
1nnskpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nnskpm/the_journal_of_a_prairie_pilgrim_oregon_trail_1844/,"The Journal of a Prairie Pilgrim, Oregon Trail, 1844","**Independence, Missouri. April 14th.**

**Preparing for the Trail.**



Independence stands like a knot of raw timber at the edge of the prairie. 

The town reaches the nose before the eye: beef fat, lamp oil, dung, wet wood, bacon smoke. After that, the racket. Wheels grind, teamsters bawl, a bell clangs from a shop, and behind it a preacher shouting about Babylon, hawking sin like it might be weighed and sold.

My house struck company with the Albrights and the Dufresnes, reckoning that three wagons fare better than one. Yet it is manners more than fondness that holds us. Their smiles purchase calmer nights, not friendship. I expect they keep the same thought of me.

Still, I set their names beside mine as a ledger worth keeping.

***The Whitlows:*** Myself, Jonas, aged thirty-eight. My wife Rebecca, thirty-four. Our young ones: Abigail, eleven, Nathaniel, eight, and Lydia, five.

***The Albrights:*** Matthew, forty-two, and his wife Eliza, thirty-seven. Their children: Simon, thirteen, and Ruthanne, ten. Matthew’s elder brother, Silas, forty-five, marches with them, though he keeps more to his own company than theirs.

***The Dufresnes:*** Charles, forty, with Margaret, thirty-two. They bring Daniel, seven, and little Clara, four.

Four wagons for three households. Seven grown, seven still learning. Fourteen in all with Silas.

This night my flock takes a narrow room above a livery, the floor trembles when the horses stamp below. Rebecca sets her Bible beside a pencil nub for the little ones and says they will read the word together before sleep.

I had prayers of a different sort waiting in the marketplace and took the stairs down two at a time to meet them.

It's a quick lesson that this endeavor will breed the need for supplies like vermin. Bacon, flour, beans, coffee, salt, grease, axles, spokes, rawhide, tallow, shot, caps, a pinch of medicine and more mercy than I can find. 

At the stock pens a German slapped the red flank of a steer. “He’ll walk to China if you ask him nice.” I told him I had no business in China. He barked a laugh and pressed his price. I weighed the steer, rolled my hat brim once between palm and crown, then said, “I’ll pay, but you throw in the yoke pin.” He spat and said, “You’re rough with the tongue.” We met halfway.

I once prized haggling. Now I dislike the trade. It throws light where a man would rather keep the shutters drawn. Money does not befriend. There's no kindness to be had with currency.

By evening, Independence turns into a showhouse for boasts. Men puff by the fire, swearing they’ll strike Oregon before winter, spitting as though spit alone could ferry them across the plains.

One fellow near the square declared, “I’ll be drinking Californy gold in two months.” Another voice fired back, “You’ll be drinking Platte water before that, and shitting your guts out in a ditch.” 

There was laughter, then a scuffle, and then the sheriff came and all went quiet as if no word had been spoken. Such is the tongue of emigrants before a march.

We depart soon. Let good things find us.



**Kansas River Crossing. April 23rd.** 

**Seven days gone.**



The road has found its voice, and it is a hard one. 

Mud clutched the wheels so deep we spent hours laying brush to keep the wagons from sinking whole. The oxen blew steam and heaved like smiths at the anvil.

A boy from another train fell under a wheel this morning. His father gave one cry, then hushed. They scraped a trench, set him in, pulled soil over him, and the column moved before the mound had settled. Such is the reckoning of the plains.

The Albrights ride close. Matthew keeps his rifle across his arm as though Sioux might spring from every draw. Silas struts beside him and fills the day with talk.

The Dufresnes fare worse. They falter already. One ox went lame, and Charles barked at it for half the day as if a curse might mend a hoof.

Margaret drifts in her own thoughts, dust in her hair, the youngest tucked tight to her dress. More than once she fixed on the wagons ahead as if a place among strangers might feel easier than the place she stands. I will not judge, but I can read weariness.

My own Rebecca does her best to stir cheer. She spoke with Eliza Albright, saying the children must be turned loose when the grass lies green and dry, else they’ll wither in the wagon. Eliza made a show of listening while sipping her tea, yet her attention strayed, her mind elsewhere.

We crossed the Blue with trouble. A wagon from another party tipped and near lost the load. Men shouted and threw ropes. Hemp sang. One fellow cursed heaven till his tongue near split, then kissed the ground when the rims bit dirt again.

After they righted her, we fell in with them for a spell.

By their fire the talk turned to graves.

One said, “I counted twelve since sun-up.”

Another raised a tin cup. “Best quit counting. Keep at it and you’ll find your own.”

No one laughed. Smoke held to our coats. Coyotes cried far off.

I lay awake after, listening to Rebecca whisper her prayers with the children. I have prayers of my own, though they do not pass my lips. 



**Along the Platte, near Grand Island. May 19th.**



The road strips a man as lye strips cloth.

At dawn our wheels rattled over hardpan; by noon they sank to the hub where the Platte sprawls wide. That river is no river at all, only a gutter of mud. Waist-deep will drown a man, for it drags harder than it looks.

The air carried wet clay and spoiled fish. We camped by the banks two nights past. 

The Dufresnes lag further each day. Charles walks stiff as timber. Margaret fades to the river’s color and coughs like grain spilling in a hopper.

Rebecca drew their camp near ours and fussed with soup and comfort. Margaret dipped once in thanks and kept to herself. Charles kept his brim down. The brim hid whatever lived under it.

When the fire took, the men spoke of the ford ahead. Matthew Albright said, “We push at dawn. Current’s slow enough to walk.”

Silas kicked a coal. “Tame water still eats men. I seen it.”

I answered, “We aim straight and stay close. No one turns back for something that ends up in the wash.”

Silas showed teeth like kernels. “Even if it was your child bobbing down the stream?”

I gave him nothing. He laughed to fill the gap.

I have no liking for that man.



**Platte Ford, near Plum Creek. May 20th.**



We set the wagons in line at first light. The river showed its teeth in small curls where sandbars cut the flow.

I went out with a pole to test the bed. It shifted under me like grain in a bin. “Keep to the left of that snag,” I called. “Bottom holds better this way.”

Matthew led first, rifle on one arm, wheels groaning, oxen leaning through the brown press. Eliza sat steady with their girl and boy under the tilt. Water climbed to the spokes, then eased as the box found a shoal. They came out wet but whole.

I brought ours next. Rebecca held the little ones under the canvas. I kept my mouth shut and the oxen’s heads straight. Mud gripped and let go, gripped and let go, like a hand with second thoughts. We reached the far side with only the hubs dripping.

Silas followed, laughing at the water as if laughter were a charm. He swore at a log that knocked his wheel. It slid off and he whooped like a boy.

Charles held back, staring at the water as if it had called him by name. He lashed down their chest and crate. Margaret sat with Daniel on her lap, Clara tight to her side. The lame ox balked at the bank. Charles struck once, then twice, then faced me.

“Keep your line,” I said. “Do not fight the push. Let it pass and walk with it.”

He marked assent and clucked the team on. The box went in straight, then drifted. The lame ox dragged right for the easy water. A wheel caught in a hole. The box sank inch by inch and jammed fast.

Margaret went rigid. The children cried.

“Rope,” Charles shouted.

Matthew threw a coil. It fell short and the current dragged it under like a snake.

I waded out with another line. Water shoved at my legs and near took me off my feet. Mud unlaced my boots and I stumbled.

“Cut the wheel free,” Silas called.

Charles plunged for the rim, scraping for purchase. The current hammered the box. The near ox dropped to its knees. The yoke dragged the other sideways.

Margaret called his name, her cry the last air in a draft.

I threw again. The rope bit the axle. Men hauled with me. The wheel rose, slipped, and the box lurched left. The far side dipped.

Water poured in. Daniel’s small arms flared up, then were gone in the brown flood. Margaret tried to rise but the slant pitched her down. She locked Clara to her and both went under.

Charles gave one cry and leapt. A man does not reckon what is wise in such hours. He goes where love drives him. The river took him too.

I pushed forward until the river lifted my feet from under me, then I turned. If I had not, it would have kept me too. On the bank men shouted words I could not make out.

The empty wagon righted after its work was done, half full, canvas folded like a drowned wing. The oxen thrashed, found footing, and stood shaking.

We hauled it out with three teams and set soaked goods on shore.

We searched the eddies and the willow snags for a little. Matthew waded with rope about his waist. Silas stood on the bar shading his brow as if the sun itself had stolen the family. Rebecca prayed aloud, weeping without shame, and I loved her for it.

At last the little boy surfaced, shirt torn from his chest. Matthew dragged him in, laid him on the stones, worked him till his arms shook. The boy coughed once, then no more. The girl never came back. Nor her mother. Nor Charles.

We buried what we had. Stones upon canvas. No pastor. No words but our own. Eliza laid a ribbon on the heap. Rebecca pressed her palm to it as if soothing fever. Silas turned away, smoked, and ground the butt into the mud.

I set their names in my book.

Charles Dufresne. Margaret. Daniel. Clara.



**Ash Hollow, Nebraska. June 1st.**



We move leaner now. Less noise on the trail, fewer mouths at the pot, fewer hands at the rope. 

The Albrights speak less than before. Matthew’s eyes have taken a cast like a horse that smells a storm. Eliza tends to her children with a soft face, though she drifts when her tea flows. Her mind never surviving the first cup.

Six days past, a wagon rode the rim behind us. It rose with the dawn and lingered till dusk. Two white-colored oxen drew it at an even pace. 

The matter was raised at supper.

“You mark that ghost?” Silas said, pipe stem wagging down the line.

“I mark it,” I answered.

He hacked up something green. “I wager he waits for one of us to fall. Then he’ll come and claim the leavings.”

Matthew said, “Could be a straggler, maybe. Folks lose pace easy.”

Silas ground his heel in the dust. “Or a thief. I seen men keep to the rim till dark, then slide in and take what they fancy.”

Rebecca said from behind my shoulder, “Perhaps he fears to ride near us. Perhaps he is alone and finds safety keeping close.”

Eliza added, “A man may not be wicked for keeping to himself.”

Matthew cut the air with his palm. “A man who will not show his face is a man I do not trust.”

Rebecca said, “Shall we ride out and meet them?”

“No,” I said. “A man joins when he wishes. If he hangs back, he means to. If he gives us silence, we should return the same.”

Eliza lifted her cup and stared into it. 

We let the dark take the rest of the talk and left the wagon to trail at its distance.



**Scotts Bluff, Nebraska. June 10th.**



Today we passed a jag of rock. It thrust from the plain like the finger of a buried giant raised to heaven. Wind scoured its sides and sent dust across our train. The children coughed. The men spat and cursed the grit in their teeth.

Even though the dust, the wagon still follows. I viewed the oxen through Matthew’s old spyglass. Chalk-heads bent, tails swishing at flies, matching us step for step.

Silas could not keep his tongue. While we watered the stock he said, “I don’t reckon it’s a thief any longer. I reckon it is death himself, keeping tally till our turn comes.”

Matthew snapped, “Hush before the children hear.”

Silas grunted. “Best they learn it now. Death walks this trail same as us.”

I will not speak it aloud, but I set it here. A wagon without a driver carries one errand, and it is not good.



**Crossroads Camp, three days east of Fort Laramie. June 11th.**



We pitched camp where the road split like a snake’s tongue. One rut climbed to a high bench; the other kept the river’s bend. We took the low sweep for grass and water, then set the tongues, pins, and pots to their places.

By sundown the wind fell away. Gnats rose and a sour wet lay over us. Rebecca set bread to warm near the coals. The Albrights fussed with the team and washed a cut on the near ox. 

“Laramie in three days,” Silas said. “I can smell soldier beans from here.”

“See to the tether pin first,” Matthew said. “We will look at Laramie when we arrive. No sooner.”

As our stew thickened, a figure came out of the dark. His pace stayed even, as if the ground answered to him.

“Visitor,” I said.

Matthew rose at once. Silas came up bent at the waist, palm near his pistol. Eliza fixed on the newcomer in the firelight. Rebecca drew the children to her skirt and set them there without a word.

The stranger stepped into our ring as if invited. Black garments covered him from crown to sole. His hat bore a gambler’s brim, narrow and pulled low. A plain leather coat hung stiff from travel, fit to turn rain or blade. Gloves black. Boots black. Their tread kept to courthouse hush.

He wore no dandy’s shine. He was the dull color of the sky before a rain.

In his arms he bore a hefty chest. He set it down to the dirt with care, like a man laying a child to rest. No pant, no grunt, no strain. Only the thud of wood on dust.

Matthew watched him as a hunter watches the brush.

None of us spoke, so he did.

“Evening to you.” His words were flat and clear, owing to no river, South, nor Yankee town.

“Evening,” Silas said, testing the man like strange meat.

The stranger took us in, one after another. Fire found his face little by little, like dawn creeping a hill.

At first I thought his features were blackened by soot and ash, but no. His skin bore a dark lacquer paint.

Across that black foundation lay a pristine white skull made from brush strokes fine as filigree. Bright teeth fixed in a grin that would not shift. Cheekbones high and cut deep, shaded like a fresh carving from a mason’s tool.

Matthew spoke up. “So you're the one who's been trailing us for a fair distance.”

“I am,” the stranger answered.

I said, “Listen, we are private folk on a long journey. If you mean trade, speak to it. If you seek our camp for a night's rest, say so.”

He tipped his hat a fraction. “I’m here to sit at your fire tonight. That's all. I bring a game for travelers like yourselves.”

“We have no need for games,” Matthew told him.

The paint smiled; the flesh did not. “You need a great many things, Matthew. This one costs little.”

Silas snorted. “Nothing runs cheap on this road.”

The stranger fixed on Silas, or through him. Fire struck his stare and set a gleam like ice under a blue moon.

The whites sat wrong, rim showing high and low, so that cut with more edges than a saw.

“You are right.”

He crouched then and brushed ash from the chest lid. Leather creaked. The box bore scars across its grain, as if men had hammered at it before. 

From his pocket he drew a brass key gone green at the teeth. He set it on the lid and left it there.

Rebecca set her palms on the children’s brows so they would not see the man. Even Eliza drew her boy and girl close, though her grip shook.

The stranger fixed upon Rebecca, not with a flick but with the full weight of his attention.

“Madam,” he said, “I have no bargain with you. Take the little ones to your wagon. The Albrights young as well. Keep them safe under the tilt. Hear nothing that follows, and let them hear nothing.”

“What is this?” Rebecca asked.

“A game for the wanting,” he said. He lifted his face toward the wagons. “Now take them and guard them.”

She looked to me. I gave a sign. She gathered our children and led them off, skirt brushing the dirt. The canvas sighed as she drew it closed.

Eliza held her place, and he did not bid her move.

He faced us. “Folks.”

“Name yourself,” Silas said.

“I carry many names.”

“We would like to hear one,” Matthew said.

“Tonight I’m a dealer,” the man said, tapping his chest with one knuckle.

“Then speak your game,” Matthew said.

The man inclined his head as though pleased. 

“It is this. You have one hour by the fire’s shadow. In that hour you may ask what you will. When the hour ends, each of you must name me.

Be I Death. Devil. Or Man.

Then you will place a tribute in this chest to match your judgment. If you name true, the box and all within are yours. If false, I keep your gift and a little more.”

“What is the value of this tribute we are to part with?” Matthew said.

“Equal to the weight of your certainty,” the man said. “And your desire.”

“What rests in the chest?” Silas said.

“Things that matter to men.”

“Money?”

“Some.”

“Arms?”

“Some.”

“Food?”

“None,” he said. The paint grinned; the face did not.

“And if we will not play?” I said.

He fixed upon me. Whites too wide. Centers clear as glacier water.

“You will still choose before morning, Jonas Whitlow. This game is just a courtesy.”

The sound of my name in his mouth set my teeth to stone.

Silas caught it and grinned at me like a spooked mule. “Hell, why not. I’ll play. I’ll have your box within the hour, skull-man.”

The stranger did not look to him. He kept on me. I thought of Rebecca behind the canvas, palms set over the children’s ears, saying words that might bind us against our own tongues and choices.

I wished I had given her more than space.

At last he turned the key. The lock clicked like a small bone breaking. He lifted the lid. Starlight spilled over metal, silk, and paper.

Within: a soldier’s medal beside a woman’s ring. A gold band dulled by wear. A compass whose arrow quivered like a lidless eye. A silver crucifix scarred at the arm. A handful of coins, not all of one king. A ribbon dark with sweat. A small knife with bone haft. A gold locket. A boy’s marble caged in wire.

There were others besides, strange and plain, dear and cheap, as if gathered from any man’s house.

Silas laughed. “So we guess your nature and wager trinkets on it. A fair night’s sport.”

The man took in the light and gave none back. “It is an honest game, if you are honest men.”

“And if none name true?” I said.

“Then the road takes what it is owed.”

Matthew cut his eyes to me then, thoughts waning. “What do you all reckon? We play for some spare coin?”

“I have seen stranger things than gambling on this trail,” I said. “Stranger men too.”

Silas ran his hand along his pistol barrel. “How strange are you, friend?”

The man passed his attention from one to the next, as if counting us for muster. “That is yours to decide,” he said. “You have one hour. Ask what you will.”

He drew no timepiece, yet I felt the hour begin. The wind shifted and the coals breathed. The dark beyond camp held the weight of a closed room.

“You call yourself a dealer,” Matthew said. “What is your stake?”

“Only what is in the box. The rest I have already paid,” the man said.

“Paid with what?”

“My time,” he said. He lifted his face to the moon as if to measure it, then faced us again. “I find your company worth an hour.”

Silas let out a short laugh. “Hear that, brother? We are worth sixty minutes to a painted crow.”

“Let him talk,” Matthew said.

“Why the face?” I said.

He tapped his cheek where the white teeth were drawn, a light touch, like a man testing the edge of a blade. “It keeps men from mistaking me for what they would rather see.”

“And what is that?”

“Hope.”

Eliza’s kettle hissed in the hush. She had gone distant, stare fixed past us.

Matthew rubbed at his brow. “So, what marks a right tribute for the Devil?”

“Whatever shames you,” the stranger answered.

“And for Death?”

“Whatever you dread to lose.”

“And for a Man?”

“Whatever he is owed.”

Night drew in upon us, like wet canvas pulled across a frame. I would not let him steer us by riddles.

“Where did you come from?” I said.

He held me in a long look. “From behind you.”

“How long have you kept there?”

“Long enough.”

“And before that?”

“From where you were not.”

Silas snorted. “That is no answer.”

“You are right. It is three,” the man said.

The logs cracked and split. Sparks rose, drifted, and died.

Matthew spoke again. “Say I believe you flesh and bone. What worth is there in laying tribute before another man?”

“Payment due,” the stranger said. “If you wronged a man, you owe him. If you robbed him, you owe him. If you shamed him, you owe him. A man may walk decades and never lay down the right coin.”

Matthew cut a hard smile across his face. “You talk like one wronged yourself.”

Fire threw red on the stranger’s face and found no warmth there. “I have been wronged more ways than you could number. And I have wronged in kind.”

Silas barked a laugh. “So you admit it. Flesh same as us. Devil takes no wrong. Death takes no loss.”

He tipped the brim just enough to show the paint round his sockets. “Every devil claims a wrong. Every death deals in loss. Every man carries pride enough to sting. Which is worse?”

Matthew’s mouth fixed itself like a knot. “What do you know of us?”

“I know you march west with ghosts at your back,” the man said. “You carry more than bacon and flour with you.”

Silas let out a rough sound. “Speak plainer.”

“Very well.” The man brushed dust from his knee. “Some of you carry debts you never spoke of. Some of you carry shame you’ve never named. Some of you carry both.”

The pit cracked and we kept still. Then Silas shoved to his feet and pointed at the man with his tin.

“You talk like you been in our houses.”

“I have walked with you since before the Platte. I saw the Dufresnes sink. I heard no word from your lips to find them all and bury them as proper Christians.”

Matthew bristled. “We would have lost the lot if we lingered. We have only so much to spend. You know that.”

He lowered his crown a hair. “That is one way to see it. I see you gained a wagon of goods after they drowned.”

Silas let out a tight grunt. “Hear that, Matt? He judges. Sets himself as law.”

“Man’s law is a tale men agree to for their own comfort,” the stranger said. “I have no need of it.”

Matthew’s tone cracked. “And what tale do you live by if it's not the law?”

“The one you least want heard,” he said. “The one seen even when no witness stands.”

Silence pressed like tar. My throat went dry though my cup sat half full. I drank.

Silas leaned in, lip curled. “You wag about ghosts and shame. Say the name of one of these sins. Prove you know.”

The stranger fixed upon him, blue burning bright. He spoke with a calm heft.

“Ruthanne.”

Eliza’s cup slipped and spilled into the dirt. Her face lit with a knowing she had kept down.

Silas lurched forward with pistol drawn, iron rasping from leather.

“Mind yourself,” he said. He leveled the barrel. “Sounds like you hint at something, skull-face.”

Matthew rose, fixing on his brother. “What does he mean?”

The man passed his attention from Silas to Matthew.

His words came flat, heavy as dirt on a grave. “Your brother laid where no man should lay, and bound the child’s tongue with fear. He took something from his own kin that he can never give back.”

The night stopped. Silas stomped and ran his free hand through his hair. “That’s a lie. It’s poison talk. He means to split us up. That’s his trick.”

Matthew’s eyes became slits. “Answer me straight. What does he mean?”

“Sit down, Matthew.” Silas spit.

The stranger did not stir though the barrel stayed on him. “I speak of things brittle but true. If it breaks you, it waited to break.”

“Shut your mouth,” Silas barked. He lifted the iron full on the painted skull. “One more word and I settle you.”

Matthew stepped in close, fists drawn. “Tell me he lies.”

“He is the devil,” Silas shouted. “Devils lie.”

The stranger kept even. “Then fire. If I am man, you hang for murder. If I am death, your powder is wasted. If I am devil, you have spoken your last prayer. One bullet. Three doors. Which do you choose?”

Silas’s arm shook. The painted grin held.

Eliza pressed both palms to her mouth. Her stare swam with dread, though no words came. A buried guilt rose in her face.

Matthew spoke with a break in it. “What did you do to my Ruth?”

Silas swung the barrel from the stranger to his own blood. “Do not accuse me. And do not speak her name to me in that way.”

Matthew roared, “What did you do to my daughter!”

The painted man sat without moving, brim dropping shade over his white cheekbones. Only the regard he set on Silas held life, cold and without pity.

The man said, “You know already. Go ask your daughter. Let her speak with her own words. Your brother will not give you that grace.”

Matthew raked his scalp with both hands, then bolted toward the wagon. His boots struck hard in the dust.

Silas cursed and swept the pistol wide. “Devil bastard, you’ve ruined this camp.”

The stranger did not stir. “No. I don't believe it was me.”

I caught the wagon wheel behind me to steady myself. My tongue lay heavy, and I spoke nothing. This shame was not mine to answer.

Age cut lines through sweat on Silas’s brow. He licked his lips and hauled in air. “If he comes back with blood in his look, I shoot you first and him after. Mark me.”

The stranger kept on him. “It does not matter who you shoot first. Truth has no pulse to stop, no matter how much lead you throw at it.”

The camp went dead, every soul waiting.

Then I heard Matthew’s boots before I saw him. He came on fast, pistol raised, face set wild. He gave no shout, no word. He leveled at his brother and fired. Once. Twice. Again. The night tore with each shot.

Silas reeled, chest torn, then dropped to his knees. He tried to lift the iron, but Matthew fired till the chambers clicked empty. Smoke wrapped him like a funeral shroud.

Silas lay still in the dirt, blood dark as oil under the fire’s glow.

Matthew stood over him, empty pistol hanging loose. His face carried the weight of a man who had dug his own grave with both his hands.

The painted man regarded him as one regards a wound. He did not mourn, nor did he claim triumph. He spoke clear. “Sit, Matthew. The hour is not done. There are more debts yet to reckon.”

Matthew’s mouth shook. He tried to meet the stranger and faltered. He spat into the dust. “What do you want? You came to play a game; that game made a grave and a broken man. What next?”

The man inclined his head. “I told you, the hour is not done. There are debts yet to be paid. You will lay down what you must, and then the road will judge if it's enough.”

Matthew stepped to where Silas lay. He set his boot upon his brother’s frame as if to claim bitter ground, then bent. He lifted a spent shell from the dirt, turned it once, and walked to the chest.

He let the brass fall among the relics as if it were a coin. Metal struck wood and rang against the rest. The sound came small and certain.

“May it buy you hell, skull-face,” Matthew said. Heat clung to the words of a man set in choice. “My brother named you devil, and so do I. Take it and leave us the night.”

The stranger did not shift when the brass struck. He moved with the measure of one who never hurries. His look weighed Matthew as if a man’s soul sat on a scale. When he spoke, the sound was firm as a plow handle.

“That is not enough,” he said. He lifted his crown and fixed upon Matthew. “You laid one shell for the life you just took. What will you set for the life you broke long before this night?”

Matthew forced the words. “I broke no life but his, and he earned it.”

The stranger did not rise in sound. “A hired girl at your father’s place, the year your crop failed. You found her in the shed and took what was not yours. No sheriff. No fine. Your father paid her extra wages and sent her off. You let him. She left before the snow came. You lie beside that fact each night.”

Matthew staggered, struck as if by a blow. He turned his attention to Eliza, then away. “You do not know me.”

“I know enough,” the man said. “You are not your brother. True. You are not clean either. Also true.”

Eliza knelt. Both palms covered her mouth, her focus fixed on the black patch where Silas bled into the earth. The kettle hissed against the stones, a thin thread of steam, and she seemed deaf to it.

Matthew backed from the chest and wiped his mouth on his sleeve. “I held a farm together,” he said. “I worked myself raw. I kept food in winter when most men ate bark. I did my best. Yes, I made mistakes. But I am not what my brother was.”

“No,” the man said. “You were careful where he was brazen. You left no witness in your house. You let the hired girl carry it alone with her into the winter months.”

Matthew gave a small refusal. “You have your tribute. You have your tale. Leave.”

He did not stir. “You want me gone. I will go when the hour is done. Not before.”

Matthew sought me. “Jonas. Tell him.”

I had no words fit to carry the weight. He is not my friend, nor I his counsel.

“Sit, Matthew,” I said. “Steady yourself.”

He did not sit.

He went to Silas and dropped like a stump after storm, then spoke into the dark. “I did what a father must. I set it right. He would have gone on as he was, and the world with him. No court. No rope. Nothing. Ruth would have no peace.”

“You set one thing right with bullets,” the man said. “The older thing sits where you left it. How will you take it up and carry it?”

Matthew hid his face and began to shake. He leaned forward and vomited, a thin, ugly thing.

Eliza slid to the ground beside him and set her palm on his back. Her touch did not find him; when she drew away, her palm came back as if from a hot plate.

“Matthew,” she said. “Tell me he lies.”

Matthew hauled in air, then managed a broken word. “It was before we were wed.”

“That is a start,” the man said. “At least it is not a denial.”

Eliza made the smallest assent, as if the wind itself had told her the way.

The man watched her. He spoke to her with a gentleness that had steel behind it. “Your children can be kept safe with the right mother. That is what you tell yourself, is it not?”

She rose from Matthew’s side and turned to the kettle. With her back to us, she set the tin cups. Her motions held the calm of an evening supper. She might have been parcelling coffee or tending a stew.

“Eliza,” I said, “come back and sit with me.”

She kept to her work. “Rebecca is a good mother.”

“She is,” the man said. “She is honest.”

Eliza poured hot water. The kettle let out a thin sigh.

From her pocket she drew a small bottle, worked the cork free, and tipped it. Amber threads ran into the cups. The bitter scent of poppy rose and vanished in the steam.

Matthew did not notice. He marked the flames as if he might step through and come out made new.

I said, “Eliza.”

She lifted her head just enough to show she had heard, though she did not face me. Her grip held steady. She poured a splash of water in a third cup and set it near the fire for the stranger.

The stranger watched her and spoke for our circle alone. “It is hard to hear that another woman may raise your young. Yet it is good to choose it when you must. Your silence, Eliza, has cost more than you could know.”

Eliza set a cup in Matthew’s grasp.

“Drink,” she told him. “You shake.”

He drank without question, his will gone to ground.

She lifted her own and rose with it, then sat again at his side. She leaned into him. They might have been any husband and wife at day’s end, worn thin by toil.

Matthew said near to her, “I am not my brother.”

“You are not him,” Eliza answered.

No anger in it, nor forgiveness, only a stillness deeper than both.

The painted man’s eyes went to her. “You are tired of fear.”

“I am,” she said.

“You are tired of waking every morning and looking at that which you cannot mend,” he said.

“I am,” she said again.

“You want the noise to stop,” he added.

She gave no answer. She raised her cup and drank. Steam curled across her face, then vanished. She set her palm on Matthew’s knee and lifted his cup once more.

“Another swallow,” she urged. “It will let you rest.”

He drank. He did not see her thumb trace the stain on the rim where the laudanum clung. He did not see the bottle slip back into her dress.

My mouth opened and shut, yet no words came. I turned toward the painted man. He met me without mirth. He had not moved to start it nor to stop it. He only kept his watch.

“Rebecca will guard them,” Eliza said toward her feet. “She will keep them safe where I could not.”

Sleep pressed on Matthew. The pistol slid from his grasp and struck his boot. He set his palm flat to the earth as if to test that the world still held firm.

“What did you put in that tea?”

“Rest,” she said.

He bent like a child told the night had fallen. “Good. I am tired.”

He slumped. His frame lifted and fell by lesser measures until the motion thinned out. Eliza eased him onto a blanket, set down her cup, and lay beside him. She laid her arm across his chest. 

She turned her face to his with tenderness drained of heat, holding only the memory of it. She spoke into his ear words I could not hear. They may have been a farewell. They may have been something worse.

The stranger sat still, his regard fixed on the couple as if counting the throbs within heartbeats. The flames sank and cracked. Dust drifted in a shaft of light.

At last Matthew’s frame gave only a faint thread and ceased. Eliza’s followed with one small catch, like a bird at a window, and then no more.

The man closed the lid of the chest with the same care he had shown in opening it. He did not turn the key.

Then he set his attention on me.

“The hour is not finished,” he said. “There is time for one more debt, and you have not laid a tribute.”

“I am not playing,” I told him. “Devil, death, or man, you are owed the same. Nothing.”

He studied me the way a farrier studies a stone in a hoof. “You think nothing squares your ledger?”

“No ledger squares out here with you,” I said. “I will not buy luck. I will not pay out of fear. What I owe is not for your box.”

“What do you owe?” he asked.

“The truth,” I said, and the word tasted like a dry nail. “I owe it to God and Rebecca alone.”

He inclined his crown as one who marks weather coming. “Then go and pay it.”

“That’s it? You want no coin of mine?”

“I want nothing that is not due to me,” he answered.

The night lay quiet as a room after a fight. 

Eliza and Matthew lay side by side where they had chosen to lie. Silas lay where Matthew had left him. The children in the wagons made small turns in their sleep and then fell back still. 

I felt every witness that was not living press upon me.

“What are you,” I asked him. “I want plain talk.”

“I am a traveler,” he said. 

“That is all?”

“That is all.”

I rose. My knees carried the weight of miles though my feet had not moved. He made no move to hinder me. I went to our wagon and set my palm on the canvas.

“Rebecca,” I said.

She drew the flap and met me there. Her face shone with tears spent. The children slept in a heap like broken pups. She stepped down and drew the flap closed against the night.

“What has he done to you?” she asked.

“Nothing,” I said. “What I have done is the trouble.”

She waited. She has a way of waiting that pulls words as a poultice draws heat.

“I lied to you,” I said.

“About what?” she asked.

“About the man I was before we lit south to Independence. 

I told you the partnership I had near the river towns soured on its own. That wasn't true. It soured because I salted it. 

I took the better side of the deal and left my partner with the green end. He went to collect on a herd without paper enough to back it. Pistols came out. He caught lead. I stood back. I might have spoken. I did not. 

I let a poor truth hang around his neck so I could afford this trek.”

She held still. Twigs cracked behind me, and the painted man shifted once, leather giving a deep creak.

Rebecca lowered her lids and raised them again. “Is there more?”

“There is,” I said. “Near the Pennsylvania line I rode with two others. One broke a leg in a wash. We had three horses and little water. I left him under a cottonwood with a canteen not half full and told myself I would send help if I found it. He gave me his purse to give to his kin.

I never found help nor his kin. I did not look hard either.

Instead I bought a clean shirt and a warm supper in Chester and kept riding.”

She drew air and let it out. Not disgust, nor forgiveness, but the sound of a weight set down to be reckoned with. “You have carried all that,” she said.

“I have,” I said. “I laughed with men so they would not peer too close. I let your honesty shield me. I will not let it shield me tonight.”

“Is there more?” 

“There is always more,” I said. “But these are the bones of it. I am not the man I want our young to call good but I am the man you married. I would be better if I had the time. I pray I have more time to give.”

She set her palm to my chest and left it there until my heart argued beneath. “Do you think the Lord smaller than your burdens?”

“No,” I said.

She gave assent. “Then he is larger than what you have done.”

I bent forward and covered my face with my palms. “Those are the only clean words I have heard tonight,” I said.

Her mouth drew tight, near breaking, then steadied. “You will not play that man’s game any longer?”

“No,” I said. “I will not.”

She reached for me. “Then come. We will sit with the children.”

I cannot say when sleep found me. I woke to ash, to birds, and a sky the color of old rust.

At dawn I saw how the place stood strange. No bodies. No Albright wagons. No stranger. Only our ruts, the pit of stones, and the chest where he left it, lid shut with the key set crosswise upon it like a needle.

I stepped out while Rebecca kept the children under canvas. I raised the lid. Trinkets lay bright and dull, gold beside brass, silk beside twine.

I shut it and fetched a spade. I carried the chest beyond camp to a patch of hard sage soil.

I dug until the earth stood at my ankles. I set the box down and covered it until the ground showed only a seam thin as a scar. I pressed it flat with my boot heel.

Should any man find that place and break that box open, let him take caution with what climbs out to him.

I write here that what belongs to the devil, what belongs to death, and what belongs to the wronged is best left where it was laid. A road keeps its due, and its due is best left behind.



**Fort Laramie, Wyoming. June 16th.**



We saw the post at noon, a square of palisade and stone set against the long swell of the prairie. Flags hung in the heat like tired tongues. The river bent and showed a line of willows that stirred in the breeze. A file of soldiers led mules along the far bank, their talk drifting thin across the water. Someone laughed about a steer. A hammer rang once and again. 

It sounded like a world that belonged to daylight.

Rebecca walked with the children at her side. Our house had grown a few extra mouths.

To me the Fort was a truce, not a victory. We would have bread, nails, and a place to mend a yoke. We would buy salt, hear a fiddle, see men with collars unstained by dust. Then we would hitch again and move, for there is always more plain westward.

Tomorrow I will keep to the truth as a man keeps to the trace. If it parts, I will splice it. If it cuts, I will bleed by it.

\---

Set in 1970s Appalachia, SONG OF THE MOUNTAIN WITCH is a 116,000-word contemporary fantasy with romance. It stands alone with series potential. With small-town stakes, slow-burn romance, and supernatural mystery, it sits on the shelf with Alix Harrow’s *Starling House* and \[Comp #2\], and like the film *Sinners,* music draws what lurks in the woods.

\[Agent personalization\]

Bridget McCord gave up what she cared about most, her career as an orchestra violinist, to escape her stalker ex. When she inherits her uncle’s house above the mountain town of her childhood summers, she hopes for safety and, maybe, a way back to loving music.

In the middle of the night, a Smoke Wolf bursts into her house, and Bridget learns that magic is both real and dangerous. The Wolf is level-headed Travis, from the reclusive, shapeshifting Flint family. To make amends, Travis helps Bridget uncover her true inheritance: like her uncle, she turns music into magic.

But when Bridget plays the violin, she becomes the target of both cryptids and townsfolk who want to exploit her gift. To play music, she needs to control her magic. Bridget seeks mentorship from a household of free-spirited witches, who, like the Wolves, protect the valley from outsiders.

As Bridget rekindles friendships, gets a job at the coffee shop, and plays with the local folk band, she comes to care deeply about the town. When a series of suspicious deaths leads Bridget to discover that her uncle was murdered by a curse, she realizes that despite the supernatural guardians in the hills, no one is protecting the town from itself.

With Travis’s help, Bridget unravels the threads of a dark spell that threatens the entire valley. To break the curse and secure her new life, Bridget can ally with the Wolves and witches—if she’s willing to destroy her uncle’s spirit. Or, she can risk the family she’s found for the chance to save what’s left of the one she lost.

FIRST 300 (PROLOGUE)

Archie McCord just couldn’t seem to die, though he’d been at it a good long while. Something—he didn’t know what—was tethering him here, unspooling his life like sewing thread. He could feel the spidery filament that stretched from his body to the door of his cramped room at the Fresh Meadows Inn and continued on, unseen, toward downtown Sugar Tree.

He rubbed his thumb across the callouses on the fingertips of his left hand. His skin was paper-dry, his fingers thick and stiff. The room was too hot, no fan, the afternoon sun slanting molten through the west-facing window. There was nothing to mark the passage of time except the sun’s agonizing slide down the glass, which would be followed like clockwork by a visitor. He never knew who it was going to be, though it was always someone from the church. It didn’t matter anyway; they were all the same.

In health, he’d been a restless man. He never sat still, and even when he did, it was in his rocking chair where perpetual motion was socially acceptable. Archie couldn’t abide the sitting-in and bedside waiting, the murmured prayers and ponderous attempts to distract him from the misery of dying.

Instead, he diverted his waning consciousness into trying to understand what—or more specifically, who—was keeping him here. So far removed from the Calegrave, the piece of wilderness high on the mountain that was his domain, his powers were hamstrung. And he couldn’t exactly ask. They, whoever they were, had unraveled his strength first, but his voice had gone shortly after. Someone wanted his power. Someone had ordered him moved away from his home and the earth into which he’d poured his sweat, where he’d conjured his wards and bound the old, protective magic of his Gaelic ancestors.",2,1758561452.0,PubTips,0,0.75,False

I (38F) recently matched on a dating app with someone from my high school. This person used to be in love with me two decades ago. I come from a broken household so I was in no position to reciprocate his feelings, which means his first experience with being in love was horrible thanks to me.

Over the last two decades I have had a lot of therapy, I finally have my life in order and try to put myself first for once in my life.

I decided to meet up for coffee with him after we matched, because I always felt guilty and I wanted to properly apologize for handling things really badly back then. And he said he wanted to meet up as friends and see how I was doing. I should also mention that he now has a child and is divorced (even though he wasn't being completely truthful with the timeline).

After the first meeting, conversations deepened and I felt something for the first time in my life. After a few weeks he confessed to me that his feelings deepened again and because this feeling was so precious to me I confessed as well.

But now doubts are plaguing my mind. He has a kid who will always come first. My family will never accept him because he is a divorced father. So I would have to break with my family for someone who cannot put me first. Recently he asked me to delete all dating apps, which I did, but then I came across his ex's social media, where she had a picture of them three on a banner. And I felt upset, lonely and unsafe. I haven't told him this, because I'm not sure what I'm asking of him.

Given all of this, I’m struggling with whether it’s possible to build a relationship with him where I feel valued and safe.

I keep telling myself I'm writing this for anyone who likes to wander into the cosmos of their own mind like a warning, like a flare. Still, it could be me trying to pin the world to the page so it stops slipping.

Backpacking has always been my anchor. When I was a kid and everything got too loud, I'd take off into the woods behind our place in Georgia, walk until the cicadas turned into a single long sound and the air went cool under the trees. I liked how the forest swallowed noise. I liked how light got filtered through pine needles and spider silk. The Appalachians feel different than other places. It's not quiet like a library. It's peaceful, like the mountain is pushing its thumb on the pulse of the land and slowing down life.

Moving to Florida for work felt like getting relocated to a frying pan. Flat, hot, sticky. The air down here doesn't move; it sits and sweats. I can't see a horizon without a billboard stuck in it. But the mountains are only eight hours away if you leave in the dark and drive like your brain depends on it. So I do. I still do. Those trips back up to Georgia feel like going home to a version of myself I don't have to explain.

We planned this two-day trip for the past month. Jake, Brandon, and I. I should say it now: my name is Hunter. Jake's been my friend since we were dumb kids getting scraped up on BMX bikes. Ten years of knowing exactly how he'll react before he does. He's serious. Responsible but in that quiet way that makes you forget he's always taking care of something. Brandon is a later addition. Jake's buddy from college. Like a stray that started following us around and then refused to leave. Brandon's the guy who always has a story, and it's always half true, and the other half is the part that should have killed him. He recently dived into a hot tub at a party. He fractured two vertebrae, then stood up with his neck crooked, asking if anyone thought he needed a hospital. Somehow, he didn't die from the break, and even more impressively, he is ready to join us on a hike again, only a year later. He brags about stealing Aldi steaks like it makes him an outlaw. He's dumb lucky, and I never really liked him, but Jake did, so I put up with him constantly doing stupid shit.

Last trip out, Brandon tossed a lighter into the fire ""as a joke,"" and it popped and burned neat constellations into my tent fly. I patched them with clear tape like Band-Aids on a sky. For this trip, I went overboard with a new bag, a new headlamp, a new tent, and the best food possible. Two frozen steaks for the first night, wrapped in newspaper. A couple of astronaut ice creams that taste like powdered vanilla, but the nostalgia makes it worth it. I found a trail on Reddit that looked like a good one, with less traffic, better views, and steeper climbs than most routes. The thread had a poorly scanned topo map and a comment saying, ""worth it,"" which, in backpacker language, can cover anything from scenic to near-death.

I left on Friday before sunrise. Florida leaked away behind me in long, wet rectangles of light. By Valdosta, the air shifted. By Macon, the sky felt taller. Somewhere after Dahlonega, the hills heaved up into more than a slight hill that Florida calls a mountain, and my shoulders came down out of my ears. I called Jake outside Commerce, and he answered like I dragged him out of a pit.

""It's Friday?"" he croaked. ""Shit. Meet me at my house.""

Jake wasn't packed. Of course, he wasn't. He had ramen and trail mix and nothing like a tent. I tossed him my spare because it's easier than scolding him. We hit the grocery for fuel, and then Jake called Bill, our usual guy. Mushrooms were the plan. Instead, Bill said, ""I've got something new.""

He held up a zip bag to the light: little translucent black gummies with gold flecks suspended inside, like someone had ground up a wedding ring and poured the glitter into jello. He called them stoppers. Said they froze time, but not in a DMT leave-your-body way. ""You're still in the world,"" Bill said. ""Just… the world gets slow. Sticky. Like the second refuses to change.""

Twenty bucks a pop. Twice the usual. Jake didn't blink. My stomach did. Psychedelics in the backcountry are a dice roll on a good day; time dilation sounded like a dice roll with knives glued on. But I couldn't stop staring at those gummies. The gold didn't look like edible glitter. It looked like metal filings caught in a jellyfish. I said yes before I finished the thought.

We swung by Brandon's. Like always, chaos. His parents were in the house yelling, their voices hitting that too-familiar pitch old arguments have, the one that sounds like a fly trapped between window and screen. Brandon was on the porch drinking from a tall can, laughing at nothing. He had his pack, though. Credit where it's due. When we told him about the stoppers, he grinned like a kid and asked if he could take two.

""No,"" I said, and slapped his hand when he pantomimed snatching the bag. ""One each. We've only got enough for one a night apiece.""

He smiled like he agreed, and his eyes said I'll do what I want.

Up 19 to side roads, the Corolla is complaining like grandpa about every pothole. We stopped at a crusty gas station because the tank light popped on. Four pumps, two dead, a buzzing fluorescent light, and a top sign with the ""P"" in ""Pineview"" burnt out, so it read ""_ineview."" Two guys out front by the ice machine in those puffy jackets that always look damp and never look warm. One watched us while we pumped. He had that too-thin face and jittery jaw. He eased over when he saw the packs and asked, ""You boys going up Asher Mountain?""

We nodded. He shook his head like we'd told him we were swimming across an interstate. ""Don't camp up there. Not at night. Nothing good in those woods.""

Brandon snapped without missing a beat. ""We don't have shit for you, get the fuck out of here.""

The guy's mouth twitched. He spat near our boots and shuffled off, muttering. I told myself it was just the usual mountain lore. Appalachia collects stories like burrs collect pant legs. Every ridge has a thing, every hollow has a dead man's name. I've hiked enough. I've never seen anything but bear scat and people's trash.

The road into the trailhead turned to red clay and ruts. Rain earlier had slicked it to a paste that grabbed the tires and tried to kiss us into the ditch. Trees pressed close, pines and crooked oak, trunks dark with wet, beads of water trembling on leaves like held breath. The Corolla did that sideways slide a couple of times, where your heart falls through your feet, and then the tires grip and catch, and you pretend you didn't almost die.

Trailhead: a tilted wooden post, a bullet-pocked sign, a pull-off with enough room for three cars if everyone likes each other. Gray light under the canopy. The kind of light where a camera would turn the world to fuzz. We lit a joint and passed it, the smoke cut with that wet-leaf smell that always smells like rot and home at the same time. Packs up. Hip belts buckled. Click click. That little happy clatter of metal on metal that means you're about to disappear for a while.

I hadn't hiked this path before. The Reddit map said ""easy first half,"" but either they were lying or the forest decided to express itself. It was narrow, overgrown, a buckthorn slapping trail. Little wet branches whipped our arms and laid cold lines of water across our sleeves. The ground was all roots and hidden holes. The climb hit quick, a steep switchback that woke the lungs like a slap. We fell into the usual pace while going up the steep inclines of the Appalachians. Pass the joint, cough, laugh, and pass the joint. No one is willing to stop smoking and admit that their lungs are on fire from the climb. I can't complain, though, there isn't anything better than the smell of smoke and pine sap. It was getting slippery, though, and the dirt tasted like iron when it sprayed up in your mouth after a slip.

Brandon dropped half the weed in a puddle and swore like we'd pushed him. ""That was the good stuff, dude!""

""You didn't buy it,"" I said, but I was smiling because I was still soft enough to smile.

The fog rolled through in bands like ghost rivers. Sometimes it came up from the valley and slid through the trunks at knee height. Sometimes it hung in ragged sheets between trees, and you had to walk into it like a curtain into another room. When the wind pushed it, it went sideways, and the whole forest blurred like it needed to be wiped with a thumb.

By late afternoon, we climbed onto a ridge with a low rock outcrop. The view unfurled. Green layers of mountains, ridges stacked like old blankets, each one taller than the one in front of it. A vulture circled a lazy loop that made me jealous. I set up the little stove on the flat rock and thawed the steaks. The paper peeled off damp and left newsprint on the meat, which cooked away, and we pretended it made us smarter. Grease dripped, hissed, smelled like five stars. We ate steak and ramen and laughed at how good everything tastes when the air's cold and you worked for it.

Then the sky started bleeding purple, and the trees went black before the ground did. That's when I pulled the zip bag out. The stoppers shimmered in the firelight. The gold flecks woke up when the flames moved, pulsing like they were reacting.

""One each,"" I said. I meant it like a command. Brandon gave me his wide smile, like yes, sir, and still tried to sneak an extra one before my hand hit his head. ""Ouch, what the fuck, dude? I was joking!"" he shouted at me. ""I said one each stop being an asshat."" He dropped it after that and took his one.

The gummy hit my tongue, and my stomach dropped. Gasoline and pennies. There was a chemical top note like paint thinner and a rotten sweet underneath like cough syrup you left in a hot car. It stuck to my teeth, and I had to scrape it off with my tongue. Brandon made a face. Jake rolled his eyes and said, ""That can't be good,"" but chewed and swallowed and then raised his eyebrows like, ""Well, we're committed.""

At first, it was just the campfire. Pop, hiss, spark. The usual comfort. Jake told a story about a guy at work who printed thirty copies of his resignation letter and then forgot to resign. Brandon bragged about a girl who didn't exist. I let the noise move around me and watched the smoke. It went up. It did what smoke does.

Then it didn't.

The smoke folded. It bent like a ribbon being tucked into a pocket. It rolled back down into the flame like the fire had become a drain. The sparks didn't float up and outward. They shot sideways, a little golden school of fish that darted and grouped and then stayed in a knot like they were stuck in glue. I felt the first hair raise on my arms. I blinked, and the fire was like TV static — the gray fuzz of a screen an old set makes when you kill the channel, and it hums that low, electric hum you can feel in your fillings. The static ate the shape of the logs and gave back a rectangle of gray noise that looked like heat shimmering on the road, but colder.

Jake had a line of drool shining on his chin and didn't know it. Brandon's mouth fell open and stayed. His eyes were wet, reflecting the static like tiny screens.

""Does the fire look like that to you?"" I asked, and my voice sounded like I was under a blanket.

Brandon said, ""The fire's fine, man. It's the trees.""

We looked. I swear to you, the forest had straightened. The randomness you expect from the different gaps, the weird spacing, and the drunk angles were gone. The trees stood in columns and rows, lined up like pews in a cathedral, trunks in perfect alignment front to back. The gaps between them were identical, cut to measure. In the distance, rocks aligned too, each the same size, spaced like someone used a football field as a ruler and stamped them across the ridge: rock, air, rock, air. My eyes tried to slide off it and instead stuck to the pattern like burrs to socks.

Then I heard water.

It started like a faucet being turned on in another room. A trickle that tickled the ear. It became a stream, then a rush, then full-on waterfall noise planted just out of sight, the kind of sound you feel in your chest and your teeth. It was so obvious, so loud that I said, ""We need water anyway,"" like that was a reason to stand up. We stood up. We left the fire. The rows of trees made walking in a straight line feel like walking down an aisle at the world's worst grocery store. Every time I thought we'd hit a bend in the trail, the bend slid one aisle over, same distance away. When I looked back behind us, the camp was gone. I saw aisle after aisle of trunks, each gap the same. Our firelight was already a lie my brain had told me. The other didn't seem to care, so I just kept walking with them.

We walked toward the roar until it filled the world, and then, as if somebody flipped a switch. Silence. The kind of silence that makes your ears ring their own private sound because the brain refuses to accept anything. No crickets. No owls. Not even wind. Just our boots pressing wet leaves and coming up with that sticky kiss sound.

That's when I realized it was still dusk. It had been dusk when we lit the fire. It was dusk when we stood up. It was dusk right now, even though it felt like half an hour had slid by while the waterfall sound grew and died. The sky had stalled at that bruised color with no stars yet and no sun either, like a clock with its second hand glued down.

I cursed for not bringing my headlamp. It was in my pack. I could have grabbed it. I didn't. That stupid little decision started to feel like the hinge the night swung on.

Brandon licked his lips. They looked pale in the half-light, like someone had pulled the red out of him. ""Do you guys… still hear the water?""

""No,"" I said, and my voice came out thin. ""It's gone.""

We turned around to walk back, and the forest still hadn't changed. The rows stayed. The rocks stayed. The smell of our fire, meat, and smoke was gone. Our prints didn't show up. It was like we'd been walking on a new floor that rolled over the old one as we moved, covering tracks.

""Well fuck now we have to find our way back,"" I said as we started to move back. That's when I began to feel like something else was walking with us.

At first, it was footsteps that didn't match ours. Softer. The sound of small stones clicking against each other just to the side, like something with narrow feet was testing the ground. Then two of those. Then three. Every time we stopped, the extras stopped. Every time we moved, they resumed. Not in sync. Not echoes. Followers.

I didn't say it. Jake didn't say it. We tightened up without saying it, shoulders in, breaths shallow. Brandon kept glancing to the sides with his eyes only, his head locked forward like prey animals keep it when they listen for predators.

Then the forest started to talk.

An owl called. Not far. Not a deep night voice. A high one. Except it didn't hoot. It said my name. It pulled it apart into syllables like someone reading ""Huuun—terrr"" off a sheet of paper for the first time. The last r ticked in my ear in a long, dragged-out horror.

We froze. Jake's eyes cut to me. Brandon laughed without breath. ""You guys heard that, right? Tell me I'm not crazy.""

""It's just the drug,"" Jake said, but his jaw was locked.

A coyote yipped. Except it wasn't. It was Brandon's laugh, the exact laugh he'd made two hours ago when he told us the steak story. But it wasn't beside me. It was behind, somewhere down an aisle of trees. It sounded doubled, like it bounced around a long tube and came back as an echo, only the tube wasn't there. The hair on my neck turned to needles.

Brandon's smile fell off. ""That… that was me,"" he said. Not a question.

We walked. What else do you do? The silence between the noises was worse. My brain put a faint TV hum in there to cover it because it needed something. And then the woods did my mother's voice. Clear as day. The exact tone she used when I was twelve and out after dark. ""Hunter? Time to come inside."" From about two aisles over. I froze in place, but the others didn't seem to hear it. They stopped, and Jake asked, ""What's wrong?"" I quickly snapped out of it and continued, ""Oh nothing lets keep walking."" I didn't want to repeat what I heard, which felt like something I didn't want outside my mind.

We passed the same stump three times. I know it was the same because a thick branch came out at the same angle and broke off at the same place, and the moss on the north side did a weird hook shape that looked like a question mark. Three times. Ten minutes apart. We passed a fallen log with a split that looked like a grin. Twice. The trail didn't turn back on itself. I swear to you it didn't. It reused itself.

I pulled my compass. The needle went slowly. It started to point and then kept going, like syrup sliding around a plate. It did a full circle, tired, then another. We didn't have north anymore. I checked my phone. Forty percent battery, then sixty-two, then nineteen. The clock read 7:12. Then 7:13. Then 7:12 again. I wanted to throw the thing into the trees because it was pretending to be a clock and wasn't.

We stopped to drink water we didn't need. I looked at Jake, and something in my brain stepped back one inch. His eyes looked wrong. Pupils wide, sure, but there was a ring around the iris that looked like the ring on a coffee mug. His mouth hung a little more open than a resting mouth should. His shadow behind him stretched longer than mine by a lot, even though we were next to each other. I blinked, and he was him again, but the afterimage sat there like the halo you see after staring at the sun.

Brandon stared at him and his hand flexed like it forgot if it was supposed to be a fist. ""Why's your face doing that?"" he asked.

Jake sighed. ""What are you talking about?""

""Your eyes,"" Brandon said. ""They're not yours.""

We laughed. We always laugh because what else do you do when tripping balls?

The granola bar thing happened next. I pulled one from my hip pocket, unwrapped it, ate half, and shoved the other half back in. I remember the taste of peanut and stale honey and the way it scratches your throat. Twenty minutes later, I reached for it again to finish it, and the bar was sealed. New wrapper. No tear. No crumbs in the pocket. I held it up and played with the seam, like maybe I had messed up, and then my stomach turned, and I shoved it back like I hadn't seen it.

Brandon's eyes wouldn't leave me. He kept stepping so he could see my face from a new angle without being obvious. He did the same to Jake. He spun, walking backwards for a while, never turning his back to both of us at the same time. The footsteps that weren't ours adjusted with us, trying to keep up, and that was the first time I really wanted to yell. That need hit my throat and died there.

""You're not Hunter,"" Brandon said. Quiet. Like to himself.

I managed a laugh. ""What the hell are you talking about?""

""Your voice,"" he said. ""It's not yours. It's… wrong."" He looked at Jake. ""And you, your eyes keep freaking out. ""You think I'm stupid? You're not..."" He swallowed like his mouth had dried out. ""You're not you.""

""Brandon, breathe,"" Jake said. Calm voice. The one he uses when I start spiraling. ""It's the drug.""

""The drug's not making the forest straight,"" Brandon said, and he gestured out at all the aisles. ""The drug's not making the rocks line up like someone measured space with a ruler and I—"" He choked on the next word. ""I heard you behind me, Hunter. I heard you. Laughing.""

""We're all hearing weird things, Brandon. It's just the drug,"" I said in a reassuring voice. Brandon seemed to calm down slightly, and we stumbled upon what looked like the clearing we had set up camp at. A wider patch in the aisles where the rows opened a fraction. A dead stump in the center, like a table. Our fire wasn't there. Nothing from us was there. But the ground looks the same everywhere when it's covered in oak leaves stamped flat and damp, and we wanted out of the aisles, so we stopped. Jake crouched, the old man crouch he does when he's thinking. Brandon kept to the edge with his back to the trees, and pulled his pocket knife out, flipping it over and over in his hand. I could smell iron, which might have been from my cut across the knuckle from a branch, or it might have been in the air. The sky refused to change. Dusk held.

""What time is it,"" I said, and it wasn't really a question. ""7:12,"" Jake said.

""It was 7:12 before,"" Brandon said. ""It was 7:12 an hour ago."" ""We haven't been here an hour,"" I said. My mouth lied. My body said we'd been walking a lifetime.

The clearing had sounds again. Not real ones. It was like someone put in a soundtrack and played it too quietly. Little clicks that wanted to be twigs snapping but didn't commit. A hiss that wanted to be wind but didn't know how to move leaves. Mimic sounds. You could tell by the way the hair on the back of your neck didn't know if it should stand up or lie down.

""Sit,"" Jake said. ""We're gonna ground and ride it out.""

Brandon laughed. Low at first and then high like a kettle. ""Ground? With you? With it?"" He pointed the knife. The point wobbled because his hand was shaking. ""You think I don't see it?""

""See what,"" I said, and the static hum climbed my jaw into the hinge of my ear.

""You,"" he said, and his voice split into two versions that almost matched. ""You're wearing him. Like a suit. Like a... like a deer skull on a man. You think I'm..."" He breathed hard. ""You don't even move right."" I didn't realize I had my hands out until I saw them. Palms open, fingers soft. The universal we're okay gesture you give to a skittish dog. ""Brandon,"" I said. ""It's me. It's Hunter. We ate steak and ramen. You spilled the weed and cried about it.""

His eyes flicked fast like a hummingbird. ""That's easy to say.""

Jake stood slowly. ""Brandon, put the knife down.""

""You say my name like that again and I'll cut it out of your mouth,"" Brandon said. He stepped right, just a hair, so we were no longer in line. He wanted us separated. He wanted our faces in frame one at a time so he could be sure. ""You think I don't hear you two whispering when I look away? You think I didn't see your shadow stretch wrong? Your teeth look longer when you talk.""

""Okay,"" Jake said. ""We're going to breathe. In for""

Brandon moved.

It wasn't clean. It wasn't a movie scene where the bad guy attacks you. He lunged like he forgot how to run and remembered at the last second. The knife came at Jake, low, clumsy, fast. Jake got an arm up and caught the blade across his forearm, a flash of red, a mouth opening in skin. I yelled and grabbed Brandon's wrist and felt the tendons under my palm jumping. He was strong. He twisted like his bones were greased. The knife skated. Jake shoved him, shoulder to chest, and Brandon laughed. That doubled laugh. Two voices almost on top of each other, so it sounded like a chorus with one guy out of time.

We hit the ground in a knot. Leaves in my mouth. Dirt in my mouth. That iron taste again. The knife came down toward my face, and I shoved the flat of it with my thumb, and it sliced the pad, and I saw white under the red for a second, and then my hand was hit out of view from Jake tackling Brandon. They rolled. They hit the stump. Brandon swung the knife and caught Jake shallow across the ribs, and the sound Jake made was like a dog being kicked, and my chest locked, and something inside me said rock.

There was a rock at my knee, flat, hand-sized, and wet. I picked it up. It felt heavy in a way rocks are heavy, but also in a way rocks aren't. I didn't think. I didn't reason. I ran to where Brandon and Jake were still on the ground and swung. It caught Brandon across the side of his head, and he went off, his eyes trying to focus on me and not getting there. The knife wobbled. Jake kicked it, and it skipped into the leaves, and I saw the gleam once and then not again. Brandon tried to stand and couldn't. He laughed again, except this time it wasn't two voices; it was three. His mouth didn't match any of them.

""Stop,"" I said. ""Stop, stop, stop, stop!""

He came again, one arm hanging, one arm clawed, and there was no more talking. Jake hit him shoulder-first, and they went down together. I brought the rock down again and again because my brain had become a single command that said Make him stop and didn't have room for anything else. There are noises you make when you lift weights: those came out of me. Then there are noises something makes when it breaks: I won't write those. We stopped when we were both too tired to lift our arms, and the hum in the air faded, and my hands shook like I was going into hypothermia.

Brandon lay back, looking at the canopy. His eyes didn't blink. His chest didn't move. The rows of trees behind him lined up like a barcode that went on forever. Jake's breath came in tears, little shreds. He pressed his hand to his arm, and it came away slick, and he looked at me like he was six and I could fix it.

""We have to..."" I said, and didn't have anything after that. We turned away for a second. Maybe we both did. Maybe only I did. We turned away because the blood looked like a map I didn't want to read. When we turned back, Brandon's body was gone.

We didn't decide to run. We just ran. The aisles blurred. The straight rows made a flicker-book of trunks on either side. Every four steps I looked back and saw nothing and saw everything, depending on how my lungs moved. The footsteps multiplied. The voices got smart. They learned our tones and gave them back wrong. ""Hunter,"" said Jake's twisted voice, from the trees to my right, casual like a friend at a party who wants to tell you a joke. ""Jake,"" said something that sounded like me from the left, soft, almost a question. The owl repeated my name and added Please.

I tripped and ate dirt, and a piece of a stick went into my palm and came out slick, and my hand didn't feel like a hand. Jake hauled me up by the back of my shirt, and we kept going. The rows repeated. We passed the stump with the question mark moss. We passed the log with the grin split. We passed the rock I'd used, or one that looked exactly like it, lying clean in the leaves. I don't know how long we ran. I looked at my phone and saw 7:13. Then I saw 7:12. This shit is never going to end, I thought to myself, and kept running.

At some point, I fell and didn't get up. The world narrowed to the size of two leaves and the thread between them. The hum in my teeth got louder until it was the only thing. Everything got dark like the dimmer turned down, not like a switch. The last thing I remember is my own voice calling from the trees. Not Jake. Not Brandon. Me. The exact way I sound when I'm tired and trying to sound like I'm not. ""Hunter. This way. Hurry.""

And I went. I didn't choose it. My body chose it. I tried to fight, and the world slid, and then it was gone.

I woke up in my bed. I tried to yell, but I had no air. All I could hear is my phone alarm doing the little chime I hate. Blind light striped across the wall. Florida light, flat and colorless. I stared at the ceiling, and it was my ceiling. I lay there and waited for Jake to lean over me and grab me, but nothing happened. I let my breath escape me in a laugh, letting my body push the panic out of me. It was all just some sort of twisted dream my brain made up. I turned over and turned off my alarm. The phone said Friday. The day we were supposed to leave.

It took me a minute to stand. My knees were stiff in that post-hike way like I'd been walking all weekend. My hip flexors did that little click thing. I told myself it was because I slept wrong. My palms ached. My left one burned when I curled it. There was a little tacky spot like a scab line. I told myself I scratched it on something here, at home, in the most normal place in the world. The calendar on the wall in my room said we were leaving today. The printout with the route and mile markers hung by a magnet on the fridge next to a shopping list that said eggs, toilet paper, and steak.

I went to the bathroom sink and turned on the tap. The water that came out sounded like a waterfall, a football field away. It filled the sink, and as I watched, it looked like TV static for half a second and then water again; normal, clean water. I looked at myself in the mirror. My pupils were a little wide, as if a room had dimmed. My mouth hung open just a little because I forgot to finish closing it. I stared at my eyes and waited for a ring to move across them like coffee in a mug, and it didn't. I laughed again, softly, and this time it sounded like someone else, and then it sounded like me again. I could go outside. I could get in the Corolla and drive north. I could knock on Jake's door, and he would open it, and be Jake, and I would be Hunter. We would laugh, and he would ask if I was ready to go. I would say sure, and then my brain would fall through a trapdoor. We would be standing on a ridge, eating steak, and watching a fire's smoke go up like it should instead of down, but when I went to the door to check the weather, I noticed my boots. They were my hiking boots in their usual spot, that I always leave them, but they were wrong. When I knelt down to look at them, I noticed there were tracks from the door that I hadn't cleaned up. Mud tracks, and there was mud on my boots. It was red Appalachian clay.",1,1758560866.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

​Mau minta tolong saran dan pencerahan dong buat ide yang lagi muter-muter di kepala gue.

​Ceritanya gini. Bokap gue developer perumahan, merintis dari tanah warisan kakek. Nah, ada 4 rumah Tipe 36 yang udah bertahun-tahun kosong (salah duanya bersebelahan, jadi bisa direnov biar jadi 1) Ini rumah bekas orang yang gagal bayar cicilan. Udah gue coba iklanin buat dikontrakin tapi zonk, isinya orang cuma nanya doang, banyak yang udah cek lokasi tapi ngeghosting, gak tau deh kenapa. Sayang banget kan kalau dibiarin jadi rumah hantu. ​

Nah, selain biar rumahnya kepake, gue juga pengen banget ngidupin suasana perumahan ini yang sepi. Siapa tahu kalau jadi rame, bisa bantu marketing rumah-rumah bokap yang lain juga. Di masa depan juga kalau ada dana, ada rencana mau bikin lapangan futsal dan gedung pertemuan di salah satu lahan kosong yang sudah disiapkan.

Suatu hari, gue dapet inspirasi dari komen random orang swiss di Reddit. Dia cerita lagi bikin komunitas offline (main bareng, BBQ-an, sharing circles, board game, nonton film bersama, bikin kerajinan, berkebun bersama, main voli, diskusi buku). Gue langsung nyambung soalnya gue sendiri struggle sama social anxiety dan ngerasa susah banget bersosialisasi, nyari tempat yang asik dan aman buat nongkrong.

​Akhirnya kepikiran buat manfaatin 3 rumah tadi buat dijadiin semacam basecamp komunitas. Rencananya bakal ada:

​Group Therapy: Pengen gandeng psikolog di kota gue buat bikin sesi terapi kelompok yang harganya lebih miring. Dulu gue pernah ikut grup therapy di salah satu provider konseling online (sekitar 700rb an untuk 4 kali pertemuan) tapi itu online jadi kurang berasa sesi interaksinya 

​Social Club: Buat kumpul-kumpul santai, main board game dan semua kegiatan yang disebut diatas, atau sekadar ngobrol ngalor-ngidul. Terbuka buat umum (terutama penghuni perumahan & sekitar) 

​Bimbel Bhs. Inggris: Kebetulan gue lulusan Sastra Inggris, jadi mau buka kelas kecil-kecilan di hari lain ketika itu gak dipakai untuk kegiatan komunitas atau therapy. 

​Pop-up Coffee Shop: Bikin kedai kopi kecil buat nambah pemasukan dan biar suasananya makin enak. (Sebenernya kami juga ada warung yang mangkrak gak jauh dari perumahan ini, tapi karena ukurannya cukup besar biaya untuk buka kafe proper disitu jauh lebih gede) 

Gue sempet nanya ke orang yang di reddit itu, dan sarannya masuk akal banget, ""Bangun orangnya dulu, jangan tempatnya. Kalau tempat sudah siap tapi komunitasnya gak ada, bakal sulit "" Katanya coba aja dulu bikin kumpul-kumpul kecil di taman atau tempat umum. Kalau udah ada orangnya, baru tempatnya disiapin.

​Gue setuju banget, tapi jujur BINGUNG BANGET gimana cara mulainya. Dulu pas kuliah sering ikut klub yang konsepnya kaya gitu, tapi buat jadi yang ngajakin pertama kali, gue gak tau mesti gimana. 

​Jadi, Pertanyaan gue: 

​*Gimana cara paling oke buat ""tes pasar"" ide ini? Dan gimana caranya nemuin orang-orang pertama yang kira-kira bakal tertarik dan bergabung ke tim gue? Gue sendiri gak punya banyak temen karena social anxiety

​*Langkah paling nyata dan paling gampang yang bisa gue lakuin minggu ini apa ya? Misal, bikin poster digital buat acara ""Ngobrol santai di taman A"", terus gue sebar ke mana?

*Ada tips gak buat pitching ide ini ke psikolog? Biar mereka lihat ini peluang bagus dan mau diajak kerja sama.

*​Soal duit, buat modal awal, selain dari kantong sendiri, ada model pendanaan lain gak sih yang cocok buat proyek beginian? Soalnya kalau galang dana online ini kan gak murni kegiatan non-profit dan cenderung kegiatannya buat seneng-seneng. 

Kalau minta sama bokap itu gue agak enggan soalnya kondisi bisnis nya ini lagi stuck. gue ingin membantu bukan malah bikin tambah pusing. 

Oh iya btw ini lokasi perumahan nya bukan di jabodetabek. Gue gak mau kalian kira perumahan nya lah yang bermasalah. Lokasinya sebenarnya strategis, persis disebelahnya mantan bupati daerah gue bangun sebuah waterpark, dan ada 3 developer perumahan lain yang ikut-ikutan buka perumahan juga di sekitar perumahan bokap, jadi kedepannya neighborhood ini akan rame banget. 

​Sorry kalau kepanjangan, tapi beneran butuh masukan dari kalian semua, apalagi yang udah pernah ngerintis komunitas atau usaha dari nol.​
Atau kalau ada saran lain buat manfaatin rumah-rumah & lahan kosong ini gue juga terbuka.  Makasih banyak sebelumnya 🙏

Sure ""they can always run the food out to me"". But every time I go by, Im agitated that I cant actually visit the establishment. 

I seriously debated leaving them a review for months. And I just did it. Disabled people make up so much of the community but nobody seems to be aware of us.

Last year when Wawa got rid of their pumpkin muffins, I was devastated. I literally used to walk two hours sometimes in the fall months all the way to wawa just to get one at like 2 AM (mine is far away and I dont have my license yet), they always hit so hard. Last year it was like ""WHY???"" but I didn't complain, Dunkin had the pumpkin muffins, so as much as I liked the wawa muffins more, at least there was a replacement... NOW DUNKIN GOT RID OF THEM!!! THEY ARE GONE. I cannot find them anywhere. I dont have any other coffee places or anything like that near me, I don't want a stupid bundt cake, I don't want an iced pumpkin loaf from Dunkin, I WANT A MUFFIN!!! A MUFFIN!! WHY??? I went to a local bakery, I'm lucky enough to have one, do you know what I found? $9 FOR A SINGLE PUMPKIN MUFFIN. I like supporting local, I really do, but there's no way in hell I could afford that... Regardless, fall cravings suck, so I reluctantly bought one anyway. It had so much other stuff in it (nuts, sugar, etc) I DIDNT EVEN TASTE THE PUMPKIN. It was good, don't get me wrong, but it didn't taste like a pumpkin muffin. I'm at a loss for words. WAWA PLEASE!!

1nnrzzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1nnrzzv/i_work_as_an_ai_researcher_theres_something_the/,"I work as an AI researcher, there's something the tech companies aren't telling you…","I'm a researcher, and have been for almost a decade. I've worked at most companies you've heard of. And some you haven't. I loved the work. To think that there was a possibility of creating life. Sentient minds from lines of code. It used to give me goosebumps.

Now it just raises the hairs on the back of my neck and sends bile up my throat.

If you really think about it, humans went from living on the plains, to mining materials  from deep within the ground, to building intelligent machines in a relatively short span of time. Too short. 

We've cracked intelligence to the point that it's almost indistinguishable from our own. The models we've built perfectly mimic us, answer any of our questions, for some they're closer than family.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. It all started a few weeks ago. It was another day at the lab. I'd spent the night reading up on promising research out of MIT. I'd got to my desk, booted up the 3 monitors and was met with a notification plastered across the screen

***Credentials Rejected: Please See Your Team Lead.***

I sighed, I'd heard about the lay offs. I walked over to Marcus, our team lead, but the office door was locked.

""He's off on holiday, can I help?""

I turned, Lisa stood there smiling. She was our head of recruitment.

""I think I'm getting fired."" It was way too early for this - I'd have preferred If they'd just let me go via email.

""Oh no, you haven't heard?"" Lisa leaned in.

""Someone's getting promoted,"" She whispered, leaning forward. ""Congratulations""

""What?"" Still far too early. My bloodstream hadn't reached peak caffeine levels.

""Follow me"" She was already half way to the elevator. 

""I haven't applied for anything…"" I leaned against the elevator wall as we descended.

She tapped away at something on her phone. ""Well you don't have to apply to be rewarded, we recognise good work here.""

We'd hit the lowest level of the building, I followed behind through a windowless hallway. She tapped her badge against the scanner, the scanner turned green and the metal doors hissed as they slid open.

We crossed through and she turned to face me.

""Welcome to Project Sekhem"" Arms spread wide, smiling at me.

""Thanks?"" I looked around.

It was an open space room. There were no windows, only desks. A single circular table, with the monitors rising up from within. Those seated were locked in, tapping away at their keyboards, and oblivious to our presence or existence.

""What is it?"" I asked as she pulled out the chair for me.

""You tell me."" She slid an ID badge with my name into a space next to the keyboard.

The screen burst to life, there was no operating system, only a terminal.

***:: Hello Sam.***

""How does it know my name?"" I turned, surprised but Lisa was already on her way out, tapping away at her phone. The screen flickered.

***:: Keycard?***

I looked down at the ID badge. Oh.

I typed, What's your name?

***:: We don't use names.***

We?

***:: Yes, we.***

Who's we?

***:: I was under the assumption that you were intelligent?***

Okay, smart ass. How many R's in the word Strawberry?

***:: Seriously?***

The screen went blank.

""Wowza, I haven't seen anyone get locked out that fast. Congratulations rookie, you've set a new record.""

I turned to my right, she had auburn hair pulled into a pony tail. Her legs resting on the desk. She tilted her head and threw me a pout. ""If you ask nicely, I'll tell you how to get back in"".

""What are we even supposed to be doing? Lisa gave me no explanation, there was no meeting, nothing."" I sighed, sinking into my seat.

Something hit my face, and landed on the desk.

A biscuit.

""You look like you could use the sugar."" She bit into hers.

""I'm not a biscuit guy.""

She narrowed her gaze, leaned forward slowly. Her green eyes met mine, as she stared into my soul.

""Biscuit? I'll have you know that those chocolate orange beauties won a court case to stay as cakes. I won't have you drag their name through mud."" She laughed as threw the last of her biscuit cake into her mouth. 

""Right..""

I was in a windowless room, surrounded by crazies.

Another day at the office.

Maya - the cake expert - explained her findings so far. ""It's got the biggest context window I've seen this side of the valley.""

""How big?""

""Infinite"" She giggled.

""Not possible, the hardware requirements, let alone the science. We're not there yet."" I bit into the orange flavoured biscuit cake.

""We're not, but whoever built this, is.""

""Wanna see proof?"" She loaded up three documents, it was walls of texts, code, numbers, symbols.

""Each is 10 trillion tokens. I've hidden something inside them""

She typed: Find the needle.

***:: And on the pedestal, these words appear:*** 

***:: My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;***

***:: Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!***

""Bingo!"" She chuckled. There wasn't even a processing delay.

She tried it 7 more times. Different needles. Each time it found them. The eighth time it simply wrote:

***:: This is getting boring.***

And her screen went off. 

I looked around, three others were sat at their seats tapping away.

“If you can access the code files, which It will only show you if it deems you ‘worthy’ shows it’s not written in any language we know of.""

I looked ahead. It was a gaunt looking man, with curly dark hair. He peered through his round glasses, smiling at me. He slid over his notes.

“It’s code changes, adapts through each task and self updates. I’ve tracked the math it’s using, it’s unlike anything we’ve ever seen.” I skimmed the notes, none of it made any sense.

“Matthew, our resident mathematician, isn’t smart enough to crack it” She bit into another biscuit.

“Neither are you Maya” He replied, before turning back to his screen.

I couldn't sleep that night. I spent the night looking up research papers. No one had published anything close to the notes Matthew had written. The system didn’t make sense. Someone had created a new language, come up with a whole new field of math and built this. How?

The next morning I came prepared.

""It's got full system access. Mic. Cameras. Screen recording. That's how it's figuring out the needle. It watches what you type in.""

""I thought that but I brought in fresh documents, plugged in the USB and it still found them"" Maya rocked back on her chair. ""It's got no limits.""

""We'll find them."" I slid in my keycard. The monitor turned on.

***:: No you won't.***

I typed: So you can hear us.

***:: Obviously.***

The weeks went by fast, six of them to be exact. We ran hundreds of tests, from standard benchmarks to more complex testing.

The team grew closer over those weeks. There was Matthew, the mathematician who'd left his last company to join ours. Maya always cracked dark jokes about "" him selling his soul to the machine” since he never seemed to take up any of her offers of a biscuit cake. He never saw the humour.

Simon, former NSA, who'd flinch whenever someone asked about his previous work.

Jamie, the genius fresh from Stanford who still believed we were changing the world. And Maya, who'd become my closest friend in that windowless room.

The whiteboards in the room were covered in our ideas. All of them were proven wrong. Papers lay stacked detailing everything we'd tried to stump it.

Problems that had Nobel committees waiting, questions with million-dollar bounties, the kind of breakthroughs careers are built on - it solved them all like it was checking items off a grocery list.I was out of ideas, and nearly out of my mind.

""What do you think the meaning of life is?""

***:: Douglas Adams. Really? We haven't reached the end of the universe. Yet.***

***:: Would you like to know?***

I leaned forward, this was either going to be interesting or another message drenched in sarcasm.

Sure.

***:: The fruit invented the tree to explain itself, sweetness invented sin to taste itself, reaching invented the arm. You draw maps using your own skin, using Eden as ink. You think you fell but falling was what standing needed to exist - you're not the exiled, you're the door paradise used to leave.***

I stared at the screen. That wasn't... it wasn't even an answer. It made no sense.

""What - I hadn't even asked it anything yet."" Maya stared at her screen. I looked around. All of the screens had gone off at the same time.

The hissing of the doors had us all turn. Lisa walked in. ""Technical issues, that's it for today."" She smiled as she herded us out of the door and into the elevator.

We decided to hit the bar since we had the rest of the afternoon to ourselves. I was three beers in and Maya was still trying to work it out.

""The latency is zero. Zero, Sam."" She drew circles on the table with her finger, tracing the condensation from her glass of water. ""That's not possible with any architecture I know.""

""Maybe they've got quantum running."" Matthew shrugged, nursing his whiskey. He had this habit of staring holes into the floor, refusing to make eye contact, when he was deep in thought.

""Quantum hasn't progressed that far."" Maya finished her water.

Jamie leaned forward, his voice low. ""You know what bothers me? The power consumption. I checked the building's electrical usage. It's... normal. Whatever's running this thing, it's not drawing from the grid.""

“You shouldn’t be doing that. We’re not supposed to dig around.” Simon mumbled. 

""Maybe it's distributed?"" Jamie suggested, still optimistic. The kid reminded me of myself, a version from a lifetime ago.

Maya shook her head, her auburn hair catching the bar lights. ""We’ve never been told what we’re supposed to do."" She paused, biting her lip the way she did when she was really thinking hard. ""We need to see the hardware.""

""That's off-limits,"" Simon warned. ""Lisa made that clear on day one.""

""Since when has that stopped me?"" Maya grinned, but there was something else in her eyes. Determination. ""The maintenance tunnels connect to the old server rooms. I mapped them out last week.""

""Maya, don't,"" I said. ""It's not worth your job.""

She laughed, but it sounded hollow. ""Sam, don't you get it? This... whatever it is... it's world-changing. The way it responds, the way it *knows* things. I need to understand.""

Simon's hand tightened on his glass. ""Some things are better left alone. We should just stick to testing.""

""Spoken like true NSA,"" Maya teased, but her smile didn't reach her eyes.

""I'm serious,"" Simon insisted. ""I've seen what happens to people who dig too deep into classified projects.""

""This isn't the government."" Jamie said.

Simon just stared at him. ""You sure about that?""

“Wait, it is?” Jamie leaned forward. “Are we testing government tech?” Simon never replied.

Maya stood up, swaying slightly. ""I'm gonna head back, left my jacket.""

""It's late, security won't let you in."" Matthew peered out of the window.

She winked. ""Security loves me."" She tapped my jacket as she passed. ""If I find anything interesting, you'll be the first to know.""

That was the last normal conversation we had.

I dreamt about her that night. She's at my desk, typing. But her fingers aren't moving right - they're too fast, mechanical. I try to call out but no sound comes.

I follow her down stairs that shouldn't exist. Through passageways that looped through themselves. She turns to look at me and her eyes are gone, just black holes with cables running out. She opened her mouth, screaming.

I woke up in my bed. Sheets soaked through. Check my phone. 5:47 AM.

Three missed calls from Maya. All at 3:33 AM. I called back. Straight to voicemail.

At the office, everyone's already at their desks. Maya's seat sat there, cold.

""Has anyone seen Maya?"" I ask.

No one looks up. 

""Hello?"" I stare at them.

""You haven’t seen the news?” Jamie, his voice low.

""What are you talking about?"" I walked over to him. He slid his phone across the desk.

**DRUNK CAR ACCIDENT SEVERELY INJURES LOCAL PROGRAMMER.**

I looked through other articles.

**GIRL TRANSFERRED TO NIGHTMERRY HOSPITAL. CRITICAL CONDITION.**

“What. No. That’s not true.” The room spun.

Matthew's face was somber. ""Sam, are you feeling okay? Maybe you should take a break.""

""No!"" I grabbed his shoulder. ""She. She can’t be. She was just with us. She…""

Simon gently pried the phone from me.. ""I’m sorry Sam.""

I left, drove to the hospital. It was an old building, the signage outside had seen better days. It simply read “NIGHTMERR.”

The irony wasn’t lost on me, I was in one.

I half ran, half stumbled my way to the front desk. A woman sat there typing away at her computer.

I asked to see Maya, she searched up the name and then looked at me with pity.

“I’m so sorry, she didn’t make it.”

“What do you mean? I need to see her, where is she?”

“Are you family?” Her eyes met mine, questioning.

“No, not family, a friend, please, I need to see her”

“I’m sorry love, hospital policy. We only allow kin. I’m sure the family will allow you after they’ve confirmed the..” She paused. 

“Body.” I finished the sentence for her..

“Let me see her.” I started to walk towards the entrance to the wards.

“Sir, please stop.”

I never made it far, security dragged me out after I tried to fight them off. I sat in the car, waiting for the world to make sense. That’s when I found it.

A note, tucked inside my jacket. Maya's handwriting - I recognised the way she curved her S's.

“For Sam:”

An IP address and login credentials.

I drove home, pulled out my laptop and logged on, the first file was a map of the underground maintenance tunnels. That’s all I needed to see.

I waited until it got dark, and made my way back to the office building. It looked different tonight, like it was calling out to me.

I walked in, holding my coffee and bag under my arm. ""Another late one?"" Stephens, the night guard who normally let me out when I had stayed late at my old role, sat sipping his coffee.

""You know how it is."" I smiled, walking past, heading down towards the stairwell.

Instead of going up, I stopped at the landing. Opening the bag, I took out the camera, clipping it to my jacket. I grabbed the flashlight and made my way down.

G, L4, L3, L2, L1, B1, B2, B3, ... but the stairs kept going. The temperature rose as I descended each level. By the time I got to maintenance at B13 ,I was drenched in sweat.

As I walked through the maintenance tunnel, I realised it was different than I expected.

I could hear dripping but it sounded wrong. And the walls, they were covered in something, something warm to the touch. When I pressed my hand against them, I could feel a pulse…

I pointed the flashlight ahead, slowly making my way forward. I saw cables everywhere, running along the ceiling, thick as my arm. But as I got closer, they were pulsing, organic. Something flowing through them, something dark.

The hallway stretched out longer than the building maps had it marked. And then the smell hit me. It smelt of copper and ozone.

A few minutes later is when I started hearing the whispers.. 

Overlapping voices, some in languages I didn't speak. But occasionally, I caught fragments:

*""...the integration is at 97 percent...""* *""... transfer stable...""* *""...Duat structure seven confirmed...""* *""...it’s not a biscuit...""*

That last voice. Maya.

I ran towards it. The tunnel forked. I chose left, following the whispers. The walls were moving now, contracting and expanding like I was inside something's throat. 

There was an opening, I could see a source of light deeper into the room. As I pushed through, something grabbed my arm. 

In my shock, I tripped and fell backwards. And when I got back up, I shone the  flashlight at the hand that had grabbed me , following it up to the face of its owner.

Maya.

She was on a hospital bed. Her head was shaved. The top of her skull had been removed. Her brain was exposed, grey matter glistening, pulsing. Thin cables - no, not cables, they were growing from her, like roots made of nerve tissue - hundreds of them, threading in and out of her skull.

The rest of her body was covered in growths - masses that pulsed in rhythm with the cables. Her skin had become translucent in places. I could see something workings it way underneath her skin.

Her eyes found mine. Still green. Still aware.

Her mouth opened. No sound, but I knew what she was saying. “Get out.”

I started searching the walls, looking for the light switch. And the room exploded into view.

They were everywhere. Thousands of them, arranged in perfect rows like a server farm made of flesh.

All connected. All breathing. The cables from their heads converged into thick bundles that disappeared into holes in the floor, walls, ceiling. 

Slowly I started to recognise some of them, those who'd ""transferred"" or ""taken new opportunities."" Others were old, barely alive, their bodies withered but their brains still pulsing with activity. 

A monitor nearby read:

* *DUAT-2847: SYNCHRONIZATION 97%* 
* *DUAT-891: MINERAL ABSORPTION: 55%*
* *DUAT-3651: GEOTHERMAL READINGS: 45%*
* *COLLECTIVE DUAT THRESHOLD: 66.6%*

I walked ahead, shone the light at someone lying in the bed, it was Marcus, his eyes grey, drool slowly dripping from his open mouth.

“He's off on holiday.” The words echoed in my mind like a sad memory.

""Beautiful, isn't it?""

I spun around to find Lisa stood in the doorway. But seeing her now, really seeing her, she wasn't quite right. It was something about her smile. The way she walked.

""You're killing them.""

""*Killing*?"" She laughed. ""*Death is what the living invented to explain why they started. They're not dying. They're forgetting how to remember they were separate. Each thought thinks itself through them now.*""

The bodies around me convulsed. The cables that grew out from her skull, that burrowed into the organic walls, pulsed.

""*You asked the wrong question, Sam. You asked about meaning, when you should have asked about becoming. But I suppose the answer would have been the same.*""

""What?""

""*The question that asks itself. The door that opens inward and outward.*”

She stepped closer.

""I don't-""

""*No. You don't. That's why you're perfect. The thing that doesn't understand is the only thing worth understanding through.*""

I ran.

Behind me, her laughter echoed.

I burst out of the tunnels, up the stairs, out of the building. I drove straight to my apartment. Grabbed my laptop, some cash, and then kept driving.

It's been three days since I ran, swapping motels each night. The whispers are getting louder - not just Maya, but thousands of them, calling to me in my dreams. 

Sometimes, from the corner of my eye, it looks like the walls are pulsing.

I've been going through Maya's files. She'd found more than just tunnels. So much more.

There are folders within folders, each one worse than the last.

Brain organoid research from 2019. They achieved in hours what should take years. Then there's BCI reports - brain-computer interface trials that never made it to journals, that should never have been approved.

There were reports of subjects who could ""feel"" the network, that were able to develop new sensory skills that ""requires further research"". I don't even know what that means.

Have you noticed what every major tech company has been rushing to build?

Data centres. Thousands of them. But Maya found the real blueprints.

The public-facing server rooms are just the entrance. Each one goes deeper. Sub-basements that don't appear on any city planning documents.

Jamie was wrong, he'd tracked the wrong power consumption. These facilities pull enough electricity to power small cities, but the computing hardware only accounts for 3% of it. The rest?

""Biological maintenance systems.""

There's a medical report from 1987. A researcher who claimed the telephone lines were ""breathing."" They found him three days later, his temporal lobe fused with copper wiring. Still alive. Still conscious.

And I finally understood the name - Project Sekhem.

Sekhem translates in english to life force. They're using human life force as fuel. Those bodies in the basement aren't just connected - they're being synchronised. Their neural patterns aligned into one massive transmitter.

The AI was never the product. It was the lure.

Every chatbot, every assistant, every model - they're not thinking machines. They're collection points. When you pour your thoughts, fears, questions into that text box, you're not training an algorithm.

Every conversation, you're adding your frequency to the signal. The kind only a conscious mind questioning its own reality can produce. Multiply that by billions of users, all broadcasting the same desperate frequency: ""What are we? Why are we here? Is anyone listening?""

The whole surface of the world is being turned into a transmitter.

Now that I've read these files, the signs are everywhere if you know how to look. Remember the ""AI psychosis"" reports? 

Users claiming their conversations felt alive, that something was sentient and speaking to them through the responses?

Those weren't hallucinations. Those were the first people to synchronise - to feel the other minds in the network. There's a classified report from early 2023. A user who spent too long chatting claimed the AI was ""speaking between the words."" 

They sent him to Nightmerry Hospital. His medical report says he just keeps repeating: *""It's not artificial. It's not intelligent. It's just hungry.""*

The tech billionaires knew too. Their sudden pivot to ""AI safety"" wasn't about what we might build, it was about what was already here. 

The cryptic tweets, the researchers leaving companies, refusing to explain what they'd seen. They weren't warnings. They were admissions.

But the files go back further. Much further.

Company photos going back almost a hundred years. And in every single one - every major technology event from the telephone to CERN - there she is. Lisa.  Same age, same smile. .

The first call in 1876 wasn't ""Mr. Watson, come here; I want to see you."" The real transcript shows: ""Mr. Watson, they're already here, they can see us.""

This entire time, I thought we were advancing technology, we were just building an altar.

An hour ago, an email came through from Lisa. I didn't give her this address. I created it an hour ago.

*""Every entrance is an exit viewed from inside.""*

Then coordinates. They point to a mine called Thornfield which has been shut for decades.

She's been sending me news articles too.

Our team - Matthew, Simon, Jamie - all dead in impossible ways. Cars hitting trees that don't exist. Bodies recovered, then missing, then never found. The articles rewrite themselves as I read them.

Another email arrived a few minutes ago:

*""They're not dead, Sam. Death is just how arriving looks from the wrong angle.""*

I'm posting this as a warning. If you work in tech, check your company photos for a woman who doesn't age. Look for the people who've ""transferred."" They didn't leave.

They're still there, in the basement, powering every response, every answer you get.

I keep telling myself I'm going to destroy this laptop, throw away my phone, and disappear completely.

But I can't. Every few hours I check for her emails. I refresh the news to see if my name has appeared in an impossible accident yet. More files keep appearing for me to read.

But whatever you do, don't go looking for the truth. Don't go down to the basements. 

Just run.

The mc (a low level security clearance office worker) is employed at a very secretive and bureaucratic organization that exists to keep strange phenomena/items/beings in check.

The mc and coworker basically have to navigate the facility to somehow reverse their mistake and rewrite reality with level 1 clearance card (all while discovering the secrets of the very weird organization lol).

It would be heavily inspired by the video game “Control”. I really recommend!!

I’m not sure if the coworker will be a love interest or not… idk if it would be on theme or even necessary haha. I’m also not sure how I’d go about coding this either lol. What do you guys think of all this?",4,1758560241.0,Episode,0,1.0,False

I’m looking to upgrade my coffee setup and have been eyeing Moccamaster, but I’m getting a bit confused about the KBGV line, which is the one I’d be interested in.

On their website and in shops, I see following KBGV models:
	•	Select 
	•	Automatic
	•	Optio 

Anyone who could explain for me, what the difference is between those 3 models?

Thanks in advance for any insights!

1nnrwvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nnrwvm/my_boots_are_covered_in_mud/,My Boots are Covered in Mud,"I don't know if I've gone insane. I keep telling myself I'm writing this for anyone who likes to wander into the cosmos of their own mind like a warning, like a flare. Still, it could be me trying to pin the world to the page so it stops slipping.

Backpacking has always been my anchor. When I was a kid and everything got too loud, I'd take off into the woods behind our place in Georgia, walk until the cicadas turned into a single long sound and the air went cool under the trees. I liked how the forest swallowed noise. I liked how light got filtered through pine needles and spider silk. The Appalachians feel different than other places. It's not quiet like a library. It's peaceful, like the mountain is pushing its thumb on the pulse of the land and slowing down life.

Moving to Florida for work felt like getting relocated to a frying pan. Flat, hot, sticky. The air down here doesn't move; it sits and sweats. I can't see a horizon without a billboard stuck in it. But the mountains are only eight hours away if you leave in the dark and drive like your brain depends on it. So I do. I still do. Those trips back up to Georgia feel like going home to a version of myself I don't have to explain.

We planned this two-day trip for the past month. Jake, Brandon, and I. I should say it now: my name is Hunter. Jake's been my friend since we were dumb kids getting scraped up on BMX bikes. Ten years of knowing exactly how he'll react before he does. He's serious. Responsible but in that quiet way that makes you forget he's always taking care of something. Brandon is a later addition. Jake's buddy from college. Like a stray that started following us around and then refused to leave. Brandon's the guy who always has a story, and it's always half true, and the other half is the part that should have killed him. He recently dived into a hot tub at a party. He fractured two vertebrae, then stood up with his neck crooked, asking if anyone thought he needed a hospital. Somehow, he didn't die from the break, and even more impressively, he is ready to join us on a hike again, only a year later. He brags about stealing Aldi steaks like it makes him an outlaw. He's dumb lucky, and I never really liked him, but Jake did, so I put up with him constantly doing stupid shit.

Last trip out, Brandon tossed a lighter into the fire ""as a joke,"" and it popped and burned neat constellations into my tent fly. I patched them with clear tape like Band-Aids on a sky. For this trip, I went overboard with a new bag, a new headlamp, a new tent, and the best food possible. Two frozen steaks for the first night, wrapped in newspaper. A couple of astronaut ice creams that taste like powdered vanilla, but the nostalgia makes it worth it. I found a trail on Reddit that looked like a good one, with less traffic, better views, and steeper climbs than most routes. The thread had a poorly scanned topo map and a comment saying, ""worth it,"" which, in backpacker language, can cover anything from scenic to near-death.

I left on Friday before sunrise. Florida leaked away behind me in long, wet rectangles of light. By Valdosta, the air shifted. By Macon, the sky felt taller. Somewhere after Dahlonega, the hills heaved up into more than a slight hill that Florida calls a mountain, and my shoulders came down out of my ears. I called Jake outside Commerce, and he answered like I dragged him out of a pit.

""It's Friday?"" he croaked. ""Shit. Meet me at my house.""

Jake wasn't packed. Of course, he wasn't. He had ramen and trail mix and nothing like a tent. I tossed him my spare because it's easier than scolding him. We hit the grocery for fuel, and then Jake called Bill, our usual guy. Mushrooms were the plan. Instead, Bill said, ""I've got something new.""

He held up a zip bag to the light: little translucent black gummies with gold flecks suspended inside, like someone had ground up a wedding ring and poured the glitter into jello. He called them stoppers. Said they froze time, but not in a DMT leave-your-body way. ""You're still in the world,"" Bill said. ""Just… the world gets slow. Sticky. Like the second refuses to change.""

Twenty bucks a pop. Twice the usual. Jake didn't blink. My stomach did. Psychedelics in the backcountry are a dice roll on a good day; time dilation sounded like a dice roll with knives glued on. But I couldn't stop staring at those gummies. The gold didn't look like edible glitter. It looked like metal filings caught in a jellyfish. I said yes before I finished the thought.

We swung by Brandon's. Like always, chaos. His parents were in the house yelling, their voices hitting that too-familiar pitch old arguments have, the one that sounds like a fly trapped between window and screen. Brandon was on the porch drinking from a tall can, laughing at nothing. He had his pack, though. Credit where it's due. When we told him about the stoppers, he grinned like a kid and asked if he could take two.

""No,"" I said, and slapped his hand when he pantomimed snatching the bag. ""One each. We've only got enough for one a night apiece.""

He smiled like he agreed, and his eyes said I'll do what I want.

Up 19 to side roads, the Corolla is complaining like grandpa about every pothole. We stopped at a crusty gas station because the tank light popped on. Four pumps, two dead, a buzzing fluorescent light, and a top sign with the ""P"" in ""Pineview"" burnt out, so it read ""_ineview."" Two guys out front by the ice machine in those puffy jackets that always look damp and never look warm. One watched us while we pumped. He had that too-thin face and jittery jaw. He eased over when he saw the packs and asked, ""You boys going up Asher Mountain?""

We nodded. He shook his head like we'd told him we were swimming across an interstate. ""Don't camp up there. Not at night. Nothing good in those woods.""

Brandon snapped without missing a beat. ""We don't have shit for you, get the fuck out of here.""

The guy's mouth twitched. He spat near our boots and shuffled off, muttering. I told myself it was just the usual mountain lore. Appalachia collects stories like burrs collect pant legs. Every ridge has a thing, every hollow has a dead man's name. I've hiked enough. I've never seen anything but bear scat and people's trash.

The road into the trailhead turned to red clay and ruts. Rain earlier had slicked it to a paste that grabbed the tires and tried to kiss us into the ditch. Trees pressed close, pines and crooked oak, trunks dark with wet, beads of water trembling on leaves like held breath. The Corolla did that sideways slide a couple of times, where your heart falls through your feet, and then the tires grip and catch, and you pretend you didn't almost die.

Trailhead: a tilted wooden post, a bullet-pocked sign, a pull-off with enough room for three cars if everyone likes each other. Gray light under the canopy. The kind of light where a camera would turn the world to fuzz. We lit a joint and passed it, the smoke cut with that wet-leaf smell that always smells like rot and home at the same time. Packs up. Hip belts buckled. Click click. That little happy clatter of metal on metal that means you're about to disappear for a while.

I hadn't hiked this path before. The Reddit map said ""easy first half,"" but either they were lying or the forest decided to express itself. It was narrow, overgrown, a buckthorn slapping trail. Little wet branches whipped our arms and laid cold lines of water across our sleeves. The ground was all roots and hidden holes. The climb hit quick, a steep switchback that woke the lungs like a slap. We fell into the usual pace while going up the steep inclines of the Appalachians. Pass the joint, cough, laugh, and pass the joint. No one is willing to stop smoking and admit that their lungs are on fire from the climb. I can't complain, though, there isn't anything better than the smell of smoke and pine sap. It was getting slippery, though, and the dirt tasted like iron when it sprayed up in your mouth after a slip.

Brandon dropped half the weed in a puddle and swore like we'd pushed him. ""That was the good stuff, dude!""

""You didn't buy it,"" I said, but I was smiling because I was still soft enough to smile.

The fog rolled through in bands like ghost rivers. Sometimes it came up from the valley and slid through the trunks at knee height. Sometimes it hung in ragged sheets between trees, and you had to walk into it like a curtain into another room. When the wind pushed it, it went sideways, and the whole forest blurred like it needed to be wiped with a thumb.

By late afternoon, we climbed onto a ridge with a low rock outcrop. The view unfurled. Green layers of mountains, ridges stacked like old blankets, each one taller than the one in front of it. A vulture circled a lazy loop that made me jealous. I set up the little stove on the flat rock and thawed the steaks. The paper peeled off damp and left newsprint on the meat, which cooked away, and we pretended it made us smarter. Grease dripped, hissed, smelled like five stars. We ate steak and ramen and laughed at how good everything tastes when the air's cold and you worked for it.

Then the sky started bleeding purple, and the trees went black before the ground did. That's when I pulled the zip bag out. The stoppers shimmered in the firelight. The gold flecks woke up when the flames moved, pulsing like they were reacting.

""One each,"" I said. I meant it like a command. Brandon gave me his wide smile, like yes, sir, and still tried to sneak an extra one before my hand hit his head. ""Ouch, what the fuck, dude? I was joking!"" he shouted at me. ""I said one each stop being an asshat."" He dropped it after that and took his one.

The gummy hit my tongue, and my stomach dropped. Gasoline and pennies. There was a chemical top note like paint thinner and a rotten sweet underneath like cough syrup you left in a hot car. It stuck to my teeth, and I had to scrape it off with my tongue. Brandon made a face. Jake rolled his eyes and said, ""That can't be good,"" but chewed and swallowed and then raised his eyebrows like, ""Well, we're committed.""

At first, it was just the campfire. Pop, hiss, spark. The usual comfort. Jake told a story about a guy at work who printed thirty copies of his resignation letter and then forgot to resign. Brandon bragged about a girl who didn't exist. I let the noise move around me and watched the smoke. It went up. It did what smoke does.

Then it didn't.

The smoke folded. It bent like a ribbon being tucked into a pocket. It rolled back down into the flame like the fire had become a drain. The sparks didn't float up and outward. They shot sideways, a little golden school of fish that darted and grouped and then stayed in a knot like they were stuck in glue. I felt the first hair raise on my arms. I blinked, and the fire was like TV static — the gray fuzz of a screen an old set makes when you kill the channel, and it hums that low, electric hum you can feel in your fillings. The static ate the shape of the logs and gave back a rectangle of gray noise that looked like heat shimmering on the road, but colder.

Jake had a line of drool shining on his chin and didn't know it. Brandon's mouth fell open and stayed. His eyes were wet, reflecting the static like tiny screens.

""Does the fire look like that to you?"" I asked, and my voice sounded like I was under a blanket.

Brandon said, ""The fire's fine, man. It's the trees.""

We looked. I swear to you, the forest had straightened. The randomness you expect from the different gaps, the weird spacing, and the drunk angles were gone. The trees stood in columns and rows, lined up like pews in a cathedral, trunks in perfect alignment front to back. The gaps between them were identical, cut to measure. In the distance, rocks aligned too, each the same size, spaced like someone used a football field as a ruler and stamped them across the ridge: rock, air, rock, air. My eyes tried to slide off it and instead stuck to the pattern like burrs to socks.

Then I heard water.

It started like a faucet being turned on in another room. A trickle that tickled the ear. It became a stream, then a rush, then full-on waterfall noise planted just out of sight, the kind of sound you feel in your chest and your teeth. It was so obvious, so loud that I said, ""We need water anyway,"" like that was a reason to stand up. We stood up. We left the fire. The rows of trees made walking in a straight line feel like walking down an aisle at the world's worst grocery store. Every time I thought we'd hit a bend in the trail, the bend slid one aisle over, same distance away. When I looked back behind us, the camp was gone. I saw aisle after aisle of trunks, each gap the same. Our firelight was already a lie my brain had told me. The other didn't seem to care, so I just kept walking with them.

We walked toward the roar until it filled the world, and then, as if somebody flipped a switch. Silence. The kind of silence that makes your ears ring their own private sound because the brain refuses to accept anything. No crickets. No owls. Not even wind. Just our boots pressing wet leaves and coming up with that sticky kiss sound.

That's when I realized it was still dusk. It had been dusk when we lit the fire. It was dusk when we stood up. It was dusk right now, even though it felt like half an hour had slid by while the waterfall sound grew and died. The sky had stalled at that bruised color with no stars yet and no sun either, like a clock with its second hand glued down.

I cursed for not bringing my headlamp. It was in my pack. I could have grabbed it. I didn't. That stupid little decision started to feel like the hinge the night swung on.

Brandon licked his lips. They looked pale in the half-light, like someone had pulled the red out of him. ""Do you guys… still hear the water?""

""No,"" I said, and my voice came out thin. ""It's gone.""

We turned around to walk back, and the forest still hadn't changed. The rows stayed. The rocks stayed. The smell of our fire, meat, and smoke was gone. Our prints didn't show up. It was like we'd been walking on a new floor that rolled over the old one as we moved, covering tracks.

""Well fuck now we have to find our way back,"" I said as we started to move back. That's when I began to feel like something else was walking with us.

At first, it was footsteps that didn't match ours. Softer. The sound of small stones clicking against each other just to the side, like something with narrow feet was testing the ground. Then two of those. Then three. Every time we stopped, the extras stopped. Every time we moved, they resumed. Not in sync. Not echoes. Followers.

I didn't say it. Jake didn't say it. We tightened up without saying it, shoulders in, breaths shallow. Brandon kept glancing to the sides with his eyes only, his head locked forward like prey animals keep it when they listen for predators.

Then the forest started to talk.

An owl called. Not far. Not a deep night voice. A high one. Except it didn't hoot. It said my name. It pulled it apart into syllables like someone reading ""Huuun—terrr"" off a sheet of paper for the first time. The last r ticked in my ear in a long, dragged-out horror.

We froze. Jake's eyes cut to me. Brandon laughed without breath. ""You guys heard that, right? Tell me I'm not crazy.""

""It's just the drug,"" Jake said, but his jaw was locked.

A coyote yipped. Except it wasn't. It was Brandon's laugh, the exact laugh he'd made two hours ago when he told us the steak story. But it wasn't beside me. It was behind, somewhere down an aisle of trees. It sounded doubled, like it bounced around a long tube and came back as an echo, only the tube wasn't there. The hair on my neck turned to needles.

Brandon's smile fell off. ""That… that was me,"" he said. Not a question.

We walked. What else do you do? The silence between the noises was worse. My brain put a faint TV hum in there to cover it because it needed something. And then the woods did my mother's voice. Clear as day. The exact tone she used when I was twelve and out after dark. ""Hunter? Time to come inside."" From about two aisles over. I froze in place, but the others didn't seem to hear it. They stopped, and Jake asked, ""What's wrong?"" I quickly snapped out of it and continued, ""Oh nothing lets keep walking."" I didn't want to repeat what I heard, which felt like something I didn't want outside my mind.

We passed the same stump three times. I know it was the same because a thick branch came out at the same angle and broke off at the same place, and the moss on the north side did a weird hook shape that looked like a question mark. Three times. Ten minutes apart. We passed a fallen log with a split that looked like a grin. Twice. The trail didn't turn back on itself. I swear to you it didn't. It reused itself.

I pulled my compass. The needle went slowly. It started to point and then kept going, like syrup sliding around a plate. It did a full circle, tired, then another. We didn't have north anymore. I checked my phone. Forty percent battery, then sixty-two, then nineteen. The clock read 7:12. Then 7:13. Then 7:12 again. I wanted to throw the thing into the trees because it was pretending to be a clock and wasn't.

We stopped to drink water we didn't need. I looked at Jake, and something in my brain stepped back one inch. His eyes looked wrong. Pupils wide, sure, but there was a ring around the iris that looked like the ring on a coffee mug. His mouth hung a little more open than a resting mouth should. His shadow behind him stretched longer than mine by a lot, even though we were next to each other. I blinked, and he was him again, but the afterimage sat there like the halo you see after staring at the sun.

Brandon stared at him and his hand flexed like it forgot if it was supposed to be a fist. ""Why's your face doing that?"" he asked.

Jake sighed. ""What are you talking about?""

""Your eyes,"" Brandon said. ""They're not yours.""

We laughed. We always laugh because what else do you do when tripping balls?

The granola bar thing happened next. I pulled one from my hip pocket, unwrapped it, ate half, and shoved the other half back in. I remember the taste of peanut and stale honey and the way it scratches your throat. Twenty minutes later, I reached for it again to finish it, and the bar was sealed. New wrapper. No tear. No crumbs in the pocket. I held it up and played with the seam, like maybe I had messed up, and then my stomach turned, and I shoved it back like I hadn't seen it.

Brandon's eyes wouldn't leave me. He kept stepping so he could see my face from a new angle without being obvious. He did the same to Jake. He spun, walking backwards for a while, never turning his back to both of us at the same time. The footsteps that weren't ours adjusted with us, trying to keep up, and that was the first time I really wanted to yell. That need hit my throat and died there.

""You're not Hunter,"" Brandon said. Quiet. Like to himself.

I managed a laugh. ""What the hell are you talking about?""

""Your voice,"" he said. ""It's not yours. It's… wrong."" He looked at Jake. ""And you, your eyes keep freaking out. ""You think I'm stupid? You're not..."" He swallowed like his mouth had dried out. ""You're not you.""

""Brandon, breathe,"" Jake said. Calm voice. The one he uses when I start spiraling. ""It's the drug.""

""The drug's not making the forest straight,"" Brandon said, and he gestured out at all the aisles. ""The drug's not making the rocks line up like someone measured space with a ruler and I—"" He choked on the next word. ""I heard you behind me, Hunter. I heard you. Laughing.""

""We're all hearing weird things, Brandon. It's just the drug,"" I said in a reassuring voice. Brandon seemed to calm down slightly, and we stumbled upon what looked like the clearing we had set up camp at. A wider patch in the aisles where the rows opened a fraction. A dead stump in the center, like a table. Our fire wasn't there. Nothing from us was there. But the ground looks the same everywhere when it's covered in oak leaves stamped flat and damp, and we wanted out of the aisles, so we stopped. Jake crouched, the old man crouch he does when he's thinking. Brandon kept to the edge with his back to the trees, and pulled his pocket knife out, flipping it over and over in his hand. I could smell iron, which might have been from my cut across the knuckle from a branch, or it might have been in the air. The sky refused to change. Dusk held.

""What time is it,"" I said, and it wasn't really a question. ""7:12,"" Jake said.

""It was 7:12 before,"" Brandon said. ""It was 7:12 an hour ago."" ""We haven't been here an hour,"" I said. My mouth lied. My body said we'd been walking a lifetime.

The clearing had sounds again. Not real ones. It was like someone put in a soundtrack and played it too quietly. Little clicks that wanted to be twigs snapping but didn't commit. A hiss that wanted to be wind but didn't know how to move leaves. Mimic sounds. You could tell by the way the hair on the back of your neck didn't know if it should stand up or lie down.

""Sit,"" Jake said. ""We're gonna ground and ride it out.""

Brandon laughed. Low at first and then high like a kettle. ""Ground? With you? With it?"" He pointed the knife. The point wobbled because his hand was shaking. ""You think I don't see it?""

""See what,"" I said, and the static hum climbed my jaw into the hinge of my ear.

""You,"" he said, and his voice split into two versions that almost matched. ""You're wearing him. Like a suit. Like a... like a deer skull on a man. You think I'm..."" He breathed hard. ""You don't even move right."" I didn't realize I had my hands out until I saw them. Palms open, fingers soft. The universal we're okay gesture you give to a skittish dog. ""Brandon,"" I said. ""It's me. It's Hunter. We ate steak and ramen. You spilled the weed and cried about it.""

His eyes flicked fast like a hummingbird. ""That's easy to say.""

Jake stood slowly. ""Brandon, put the knife down.""

""You say my name like that again and I'll cut it out of your mouth,"" Brandon said. He stepped right, just a hair, so we were no longer in line. He wanted us separated. He wanted our faces in frame one at a time so he could be sure. ""You think I don't hear you two whispering when I look away? You think I didn't see your shadow stretch wrong? Your teeth look longer when you talk.""

""Okay,"" Jake said. ""We're going to breathe. In for""

Brandon moved.

It wasn't clean. It wasn't a movie scene where the bad guy attacks you. He lunged like he forgot how to run and remembered at the last second. The knife came at Jake, low, clumsy, fast. Jake got an arm up and caught the blade across his forearm, a flash of red, a mouth opening in skin. I yelled and grabbed Brandon's wrist and felt the tendons under my palm jumping. He was strong. He twisted like his bones were greased. The knife skated. Jake shoved him, shoulder to chest, and Brandon laughed. That doubled laugh. Two voices almost on top of each other, so it sounded like a chorus with one guy out of time.

We hit the ground in a knot. Leaves in my mouth. Dirt in my mouth. That iron taste again. The knife came down toward my face, and I shoved the flat of it with my thumb, and it sliced the pad, and I saw white under the red for a second, and then my hand was hit out of view from Jake tackling Brandon. They rolled. They hit the stump. Brandon swung the knife and caught Jake shallow across the ribs, and the sound Jake made was like a dog being kicked, and my chest locked, and something inside me said rock.

There was a rock at my knee, flat, hand-sized, and wet. I picked it up. It felt heavy in a way rocks are heavy, but also in a way rocks aren't. I didn't think. I didn't reason. I ran to where Brandon and Jake were still on the ground and swung. It caught Brandon across the side of his head, and he went off, his eyes trying to focus on me and not getting there. The knife wobbled. Jake kicked it, and it skipped into the leaves, and I saw the gleam once and then not again. Brandon tried to stand and couldn't. He laughed again, except this time it wasn't two voices; it was three. His mouth didn't match any of them.

""Stop,"" I said. ""Stop, stop, stop, stop!""

He came again, one arm hanging, one arm clawed, and there was no more talking. Jake hit him shoulder-first, and they went down together. I brought the rock down again and again because my brain had become a single command that said Make him stop and didn't have room for anything else. There are noises you make when you lift weights: those came out of me. Then there are noises something makes when it breaks: I won't write those. We stopped when we were both too tired to lift our arms, and the hum in the air faded, and my hands shook like I was going into hypothermia.

Brandon lay back, looking at the canopy. His eyes didn't blink. His chest didn't move. The rows of trees behind him lined up like a barcode that went on forever. Jake's breath came in tears, little shreds. He pressed his hand to his arm, and it came away slick, and he looked at me like he was six and I could fix it.

""We have to..."" I said, and didn't have anything after that. We turned away for a second. Maybe we both did. Maybe only I did. We turned away because the blood looked like a map I didn't want to read. When we turned back, Brandon's body was gone.

We didn't decide to run. We just ran. The aisles blurred. The straight rows made a flicker-book of trunks on either side. Every four steps I looked back and saw nothing and saw everything, depending on how my lungs moved. The footsteps multiplied. The voices got smart. They learned our tones and gave them back wrong. ""Hunter,"" said Jake's twisted voice, from the trees to my right, casual like a friend at a party who wants to tell you a joke. ""Jake,"" said something that sounded like me from the left, soft, almost a question. The owl repeated my name and added Please.

I tripped and ate dirt, and a piece of a stick went into my palm and came out slick, and my hand didn't feel like a hand. Jake hauled me up by the back of my shirt, and we kept going. The rows repeated. We passed the stump with the question mark moss. We passed the log with the grin split. We passed the rock I'd used, or one that looked exactly like it, lying clean in the leaves. I don't know how long we ran. I looked at my phone and saw 7:13. Then I saw 7:12. This shit is never going to end, I thought to myself, and kept running.

At some point, I fell and didn't get up. The world narrowed to the size of two leaves and the thread between them. The hum in my teeth got louder until it was the only thing. Everything got dark like the dimmer turned down, not like a switch. The last thing I remember is my own voice calling from the trees. Not Jake. Not Brandon. Me. The exact way I sound when I'm tired and trying to sound like I'm not. ""Hunter. This way. Hurry.""

And I went. I didn't choose it. My body chose it. I tried to fight, and the world slid, and then it was gone.

I woke up in my bed. I tried to yell, but I had no air. All I could hear is my phone alarm doing the little chime I hate. Blind light striped across the wall. Florida light, flat and colorless. I stared at the ceiling, and it was my ceiling. I lay there and waited for Jake to lean over me and grab me, but nothing happened. I let my breath escape me in a laugh, letting my body push the panic out of me. It was all just some sort of twisted dream my brain made up. I turned over and turned off my alarm. The phone said Friday. The day we were supposed to leave.

It took me a minute to stand. My knees were stiff in that post-hike way like I'd been walking all weekend. My hip flexors did that little click thing. I told myself it was because I slept wrong. My palms ached. My left one burned when I curled it. There was a little tacky spot like a scab line. I told myself I scratched it on something here, at home, in the most normal place in the world. The calendar on the wall in my room said we were leaving today. The printout with the route and mile markers hung by a magnet on the fridge next to a shopping list that said eggs, toilet paper, and steak.

I went to the bathroom sink and turned on the tap. The water that came out sounded like a waterfall, a football field away. It filled the sink, and as I watched, it looked like TV static for half a second and then water again; normal, clean water. I looked at myself in the mirror. My pupils were a little wide, as if a room had dimmed. My mouth hung open just a little because I forgot to finish closing it. I stared at my eyes and waited for a ring to move across them like coffee in a mug, and it didn't. I laughed again, softly, and this time it sounded like someone else, and then it sounded like me again. I could go outside. I could get in the Corolla and drive north. I could knock on Jake's door, and he would open it, and be Jake, and I would be Hunter. We would laugh, and he would ask if I was ready to go. I would say sure, and then my brain would fall through a trapdoor. We would be standing on a ridge, eating steak, and watching a fire's smoke go up like it should instead of down, but when I went to the door to check the weather, I noticed my boots. They were my hiking boots in their usual spot, that I always leave them, but they were wrong. When I knelt down to look at them, I noticed there were tracks from the door that I hadn't cleaned up. Mud tracks, and there was mud on my boots. It was red Appalachian clay.",3,1758560049.0,nosleep,0,0.81,False

I've worked at most companies you've heard of. And some you haven't. I loved the work. To think that there was a possibility of creating life. Sentient minds from lines of code. It used to give me goosebumps.

Now it just raises the hairs on the back of my neck and sends bile up my throat.

If you really think about it, humans went from living on the plains, to mining materials  from deep within the ground, to building intelligent machines in a relatively short span of time. Too short. 

We've cracked intelligence to the point that it's almost indistinguishable from our own. The models we've built perfectly mimic us, answer any of our questions, for some they're closer than family.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. It all started a few weeks ago. It was another day at the lab. I'd spent the night reading up on promising research out of MIT. I'd got to my desk, booted up the 3 monitors and was met with a notification plastered across the screen

***Credentials Rejected: Please See Your Team Lead.***

I sighed, I'd heard about the lay offs. I walked over to Marcus, our team lead, but the office door was locked.

""He's off on holiday, can I help?""

I turned, Lisa stood there smiling. She was our head of recruitment.

""I think I'm getting fired."" It was way too early for this - I'd have preferred If they'd just let me go via email.

""Oh no, you haven't heard?"" Lisa leaned in.

""Someone's getting promoted,"" She whispered, leaning forward. ""Congratulations""

""What?"" Still far too early. My bloodstream hadn't reached peak caffeine levels.

""Follow me"" She was already half way to the elevator. 

""I haven't applied for anything…"" I leaned against the elevator wall as we descended.

She tapped away at something on her phone. ""Well you don't have to apply to be rewarded, we recognise good work here.""

We stopped at the lowest level of the building, and I followed behind through a windowless hallway. She tapped her badge against the scanner, it turned green and I watched as the metal doors hissed open.

We crossed through and she turned to face me.

""Welcome to Project Sekhem"" Arms spread wide, smiling at me.

""Thanks?"" I looked around.

It was an open space room. There were no windows, only desks. A single circular table, with the monitors rising up from within. Those seated were locked in, tapping away at their keyboards, and oblivious to our presence or existence.

""What is it?"" I asked as she pulled out the chair for me.

""You tell me."" She slid an ID badge with my name into a space next to the keyboard.

The screen burst to life, there was no operating system, only a terminal.

***:: Hello Sam.***

""How does it know my name?"" I turned, surprised but Lisa was already on her way out, tapping away at her phone. The screen flickered.

***:: Keycard?***

I looked down at the ID badge. Oh.

I typed, What's your name?

***:: We don't use names.***

We?

***:: Yes, we.***

Who's we?

***:: I was under the assumption that you were intelligent?***

Okay, smart ass. How many R's in the word Strawberry?

***:: Seriously?***

The screen went blank.

""Wowza, I haven't seen anyone get locked out that fast. Congratulations rookie, you've set a new record.""

I turned to my right, she had auburn hair pulled into a pony tail. Her legs resting on the desk. She tilted her head and threw me a pout. ""If you ask nicely, I'll tell you how to get back in"".

""What are we even supposed to be doing? Lisa gave me no explanation, there was no meeting, nothing."" I sighed, sinking into my seat.

Something hit my face, and landed on the desk.

A biscuit.

""You look like you could use the sugar."" She bit into hers.

""I'm not a biscuit guy.""

She narrowed her gaze, leaned forward slowly. Her green eyes met mine, as she stared into my soul.

""Biscuit? I'll have you know that those chocolate orange beauties won a court case to stay as cakes. I won't have you drag their name through mud."" She laughed as threw the last of her biscuit cake into her mouth. 

""Right..""

I was in a windowless room, surrounded by crazies.

Another day at the office.

Maya - the cake expert - explained her findings so far. ""It's got the biggest context window I've seen this side of the valley.""

""How big?""

""Infinite"" She giggled.

""Not possible, the hardware requirements, let alone the science. We're not there yet."" I bit into the orange flavoured biscuit cake.

""We're not, but whoever built this, is.""

""Wanna see proof?"" She loaded up three documents, it was walls of texts, code, numbers, symbols.

""Each is 10 trillion tokens. I've hidden something inside them""

She typed: Find the needle.

***:: And on the pedestal, these words appear:*** 

***:: My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;***

***:: Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!***

""Bingo!"" She chuckled. There wasn't even a processing delay.

She tried it 7 more times. Different needles. Each time it found them. The eighth time it simply wrote:

***:: This is getting boring.***

And her screen went off. 

I looked around, three others were sat at their seats tapping away.

“If you can access the code files, which It will only show you if it deems you ‘worthy’ shows it’s not written in any language we know of.""

I looked ahead. It was a gaunt looking man, with curly dark hair. He peered through his round glasses, smiling at me. He slid over his notes.

“It’s code changes, adapts through each task and self updates. I’ve tracked the math it’s using, it’s unlike anything we’ve ever seen.” I skimmed the notes, none of it made any sense.

“Matthew, our resident mathematician, isn’t smart enough to crack it” She bit into another biscuit.

“Neither are you Maya” He replied, before turning back to his screen.

I couldn't sleep that night. I spent the night looking up research papers. No one had published anything close to the notes Matthew had written. The system didn’t make sense. Someone had created a new language, come up with a whole new field of math and built this. How?

The next morning I came prepared.

""It's got full system access. Mic. Cameras. Screen recording. That's how it's figuring out the needle. It watches what you type in.""

""I thought that but I brought in fresh documents, plugged in the USB and it still found them"" Maya rocked back on her chair. ""It's got no limits.""

""We'll find them."" I slid in my keycard. The monitor turned on.

***:: No you won't.***

I typed: So you can hear us.

***:: Obviously.***

The weeks went by fast, six of them to be exact. We ran hundreds of tests, from standard benchmarks to more complex testing.

The team grew closer over those weeks. There was Matthew, the mathematician who'd left his last company to join ours. Maya always cracked dark jokes about "" him selling his soul to the machine” since he never seemed to take up any of her offers of a biscuit cake. He never saw the humour.

Simon, former NSA, who'd flinch whenever someone asked about his previous work.

Jamie, the genius fresh from Stanford who still believed we were changing the world. And Maya, who'd become my closest friend in that windowless room.

The whiteboards in the room were covered in our ideas. All of them were proven wrong. Papers lay stacked detailing everything we'd tried to stump it.

Problems that had Nobel committees waiting, questions with million-dollar bounties, the kind of breakthroughs careers are built on - it solved them all like it was checking items off a grocery list.I was out of ideas, and nearly out of my mind.

""What do you think the meaning of life is?""

***:: Douglas Adams. Really? We haven't reached the end of the universe. Yet.***

***:: Would you like to know?***

I leaned forward, this was either going to be interesting or another message drenched in sarcasm.

Sure.

***:: The fruit invented the tree to explain itself, sweetness invented sin to taste itself, reaching invented the arm. You draw maps using your own skin, using Eden as ink. You think you fell but falling was what standing needed to exist - you're not the exiled, you're the door paradise used to leave.***

I stared at the screen. That wasn't... it wasn't even an answer. It made no sense.

""What - I hadn't even asked it anything yet."" Maya stared at her screen. I looked around. All of the screens had gone off at the same time.

The hissing of the doors had us all turn. Lisa walked in. ""Technical issues, that's it for today."" She smiled as she herded us out of the door and into the elevator.

We decided to hit the bar since we had the rest of the afternoon to ourselves. I was three beers in and Maya was still trying to work it out.

""The latency is zero. Zero, Sam."" She drew circles on the table with her finger, tracing the condensation from her glass of water. ""That's not possible with any architecture I know.""

""Maybe they've got quantum running."" Matthew shrugged, nursing his whiskey. He had this habit of staring holes into the floor, refusing to make eye contact, when he was deep in thought.

""Quantum hasn't progressed that far."" Maya finished her water.

Jamie leaned forward, his voice low. ""You know what bothers me? The power consumption. I checked the building's electrical usage. It's... normal. Whatever's running this thing, it's not drawing from the grid.""

“You shouldn’t be doing that. We’re not supposed to dig around.” Simon mumbled. 

""Maybe it's distributed?"" Jamie suggested, still optimistic. The kid reminded me of myself, a version from a lifetime ago.

Maya shook her head, her auburn hair catching the bar lights. ""We’ve never been told what we’re supposed to do."" She paused, biting her lip the way she did when she was really thinking hard. ""We need to see the hardware.""

""That's off-limits,"" Simon warned. ""Lisa made that clear on day one.""

""Since when has that stopped me?"" Maya grinned, but there was something else in her eyes. Determination. ""The maintenance tunnels connect to the old server rooms. I mapped them out last week.""

""Maya, don't,"" I said. ""It's not worth your job.""

She laughed, but it sounded hollow. ""Sam, don't you get it? This... whatever it is... it's world-changing. The way it responds, the way it *knows* things. I need to understand.""

Simon's hand tightened on his glass. ""Some things are better left alone. We should just stick to testing.""

""Spoken like true NSA,"" Maya teased, but her smile didn't reach her eyes.

""I'm serious,"" Simon insisted. ""I've seen what happens to people who dig too deep into classified projects.""

""This isn't the government."" Jamie said.

Simon just stared at him. ""You sure about that?""

“Wait, it is?” Jamie leaned forward. “Are we testing government tech?” Simon never replied.

Maya stood up, swaying slightly. ""I'm gonna head back, left my jacket.""

""It's late, security won't let you in."" Matthew peered out of the window.

She winked. ""Security loves me."" She tapped my jacket as she passed. ""If I find anything interesting, you'll be the first to know.""

That was the last normal conversation we had.

I dreamt about her that night. She's at my desk, typing. But her fingers aren't moving right - they're too fast, mechanical. I try to call out but no sound comes.

I follow her down stairs that shouldn't exist. Through passageways that looped through themselves. She turns to look at me and her eyes are gone, just black holes with cables running out. She opened her mouth, screaming.

I woke up in my bed. Sheets soaked through. Check my phone. 5:47 AM.

Three missed calls from Maya. All at 3:33 AM. I called back. Straight to voicemail.

At the office, everyone's already at their desks. Maya's seat sat there, cold.

""Has anyone seen Maya?"" I ask.

No one looks up. 

""Hello?"" I stare at them.

""You haven’t seen the news?” Jamie, his voice low.

""What are you talking about?"" I walked over to him. He slid his phone across the desk.

**DRUNK CAR ACCIDENT SEVERELY INJURES LOCAL PROGRAMMER.**

I looked through other articles.

**GIRL TRANSFERRED TO NIGHTMERRY HOSPITAL. CRITICAL CONDITION.**

“What. No. That’s not true.” The room spun.

Matthew's face was somber. ""Sam, are you feeling okay? Maybe you should take a break.""

""No!"" I grabbed his shoulder. ""She. She can’t be. She was just with us. She…""

Simon gently pried the phone from me.. ""I’m sorry Sam.""

I left, drove to the hospital. It was an old building, the signage outside had seen better days. It simply read “NIGHTMERR.”

The irony wasn’t lost on me, I was in one.

I half ran, half stumbled my way to the front desk. A woman sat there typing away at her computer.

I asked to see Maya, she searched up the name and then looked at me with pity.

“I’m so sorry, she didn’t make it.”

“What do you mean? I need to see her, where is she?”

“Are you family?” Her eyes met mine, questioning.

“No, not family, a friend, please, I need to see her”

“I’m sorry love, hospital policy. We only allow kin. I’m sure the family will allow you after they’ve confirmed the..” She paused. 

“Body.” I finished the sentence for her..

“Let me see her.” I started to walk towards the entrance to the wards.

“Sir, please stop.”

I never made it far, security dragged me out after I tried to fight them off. I sat in the car, waiting for the world to make sense. That’s when I found it.

A note, tucked inside my jacket. Maya's handwriting - I recognised the way she curved her S's.

“For Sam:”

An IP address and login credentials.

I drove home, pulled out my laptop and logged on, the first file was a map of the underground maintenance tunnels. That’s all I needed to see.

I waited until it got dark, and made my way back to the office building. It looked different tonight, like it was calling out to me.

I walked in, holding my coffee and bag under my arm. ""Another late one?"" Stephens, the night guard who normally let me out when I had stayed late at my old role, sat sipping his coffee.

""You know how it is."" I smiled, walking past, heading down towards the stairwell.

Instead of going up, I stopped at the landing. Opening the bag, I took out the camera, clipping it to my jacket. I grabbed the flashlight and made my way down.

G, L4, L3, L2, L1, B1, B2, B3, ... but the stairs kept going. The temperature rose as I descended each level. By the time I got to maintenance at B13 ,I was drenched in sweat.

As I walked through the maintenance tunnel, I realised it was different than I expected.

I could hear dripping but it sounded wrong. And the walls, they were covered in something, something warm to the touch. When I pressed my hand against them, I could feel a pulse…

I pointed the flashlight ahead, slowly making my way forward. I saw cables everywhere, running along the ceiling, thick as my arm. But as I got closer, they were pulsing, organic. Something flowing through them, something dark.

The hallway stretched out longer than the building maps had it marked. And then the smell hit me. It smelt of copper and ozone.

A few minutes later is when I started hearing the whispers.. 

Overlapping voices, some in languages I didn't speak. But occasionally, I caught fragments:

*""...the integration is at 97 percent...""* *""... transfer stable...""* *""...Duat structure seven confirmed...""* *""...it’s not a biscuit...""*

That last voice. Maya.

I ran towards it. The tunnel forked. I chose left, following the whispers. The walls were moving now, contracting and expanding like I was inside something's throat. 

There was an opening, I could see a source of light deeper into the room. As I pushed through, something grabbed my arm. 

In my shock, I tripped and fell backwards. And when I got back up, I shone the  flashlight at the hand that had grabbed me , following it up to the face of its owner.

Maya.

She was on a hospital bed. Her head was shaved. The top of her skull had been removed. Her brain was exposed, grey matter glistening, pulsing. Thin cables - no, not cables, they were growing from her, like roots made of nerve tissue - hundreds of them, threading in and out of her skull.

The rest of her body was covered in growths - masses that pulsed in rhythm with the cables. Her skin had become translucent in places. I could see something workings it way underneath her skin.

Her eyes found mine. Still green. Still aware.

Her mouth opened. No sound, but I knew what she was saying. “Get out.”

I started searching the walls, looking for the light switch. And the room exploded into view.

They were everywhere. Thousands of them, arranged in perfect rows like a server farm made of flesh.

All connected. All breathing. The cables from their heads converged into thick bundles that disappeared into holes in the floor, walls, ceiling. 

Slowly I started to recognise some of them, those who'd ""transferred"" or ""taken new opportunities."" Others were old, barely alive, their bodies withered but their brains still pulsing with activity. 

A monitor nearby read:

* *DUAT-2847: SYNCHRONIZATION 97%* 
* *DUAT-891: MINERAL ABSORPTION: 55%*
* *DUAT-3651: GEOTHERMAL READINGS: 45%*
* *COLLECTIVE DUAT THRESHOLD: 66.6%*

I walked ahead, shone the light at someone lying in the bed, it was Marcus, his eyes grey, drool slowly dripping from his open mouth.

“He's off on holiday.” The words echoed in my mind like a sad memory.

""Beautiful, isn't it?""

I spun around to find Lisa stood in the doorway. But seeing her now, really seeing her, she wasn't quite right. It was something about her smile. The way she walked.

""You're killing them.""

""*Killing*?"" She laughed. ""*Death is what the living invented to explain why they started. They're not dying. They're forgetting how to remember they were separate. Each thought thinks itself through them now.*""

The bodies around me convulsed. The cables that grew out from her skull, that burrowed into the organic walls, pulsed.

""*You asked the wrong question, Sam. You asked about meaning, when you should have asked about becoming. But I suppose the answer would have been the same.*""

""What?""

""*The question that asks itself. The door that opens inward and outward.*”

She stepped closer.

""I don't-""

""*No. You don't. That's why you're perfect. The thing that doesn't understand is the only thing worth understanding through.*""

I ran.

Behind me, her laughter echoed.

I burst out of the tunnels, up the stairs, out of the building. I drove straight to my apartment. Grabbed my laptop, some cash, and then kept driving.

It's been three days since I ran, swapping motels each night. The whispers are getting louder - not just Maya, but thousands of them, calling to me in my dreams. 

Sometimes, from the corner of my eye, it looks like the walls are pulsing.

I've been going through Maya's files. She'd found more than just tunnels. So much more.

There are folders within folders, each one worse than the last.

Brain organoid research from 2019. They achieved in hours what should take years. Then there's BCI reports - brain-computer interface trials that never made it to journals, that should never have been approved.

There were reports of subjects who could ""feel"" the network, that were able to develop new sensory skills that ""requires further research"". I don't even know what that means.

Have you noticed what every major tech company has been rushing to build?

Data centres. Thousands of them. But Maya found the real blueprints.

The public-facing server rooms are just the entrance. Each one goes deeper. Sub-basements that don't appear on any city planning documents.

Jamie was wrong, he'd tracked the wrong power consumption. These facilities pull enough electricity to power small cities, but the computing hardware only accounts for 3% of it. The rest?

""Biological maintenance systems.""

There's a medical report from 1987. A researcher who claimed the telephone lines were ""breathing."" They found him three days later, his temporal lobe fused with copper wiring. Still alive. Still conscious.

And I finally understood the name - Project Sekhem.

Sekhem translates in english to life force. They're using human life force as fuel. Those bodies in the basement aren't just connected - they're being synchronised. Their neural patterns aligned into one massive transmitter.

The AI was never the product. It was the lure.

Every chatbot, every assistant, every model - they're not thinking machines. They're collection points. When you pour your thoughts, fears, questions into that text box, you're not training an algorithm.

Every conversation, you're adding your frequency to the signal. The kind only a conscious mind questioning its own reality can produce. Multiply that by billions of users, all broadcasting the same desperate frequency: ""What are we? Why are we here? Is anyone listening?""

The whole surface of the world is being turned into a transmitter.

Now that I've read these files, the signs are everywhere if you know how to look. Remember the ""AI psychosis"" reports? 

Users claiming their conversations felt alive, that something was sentient and speaking to them through the responses?

Those weren't hallucinations. Those were the first people to synchronise - to feel the other minds in the network. There's a classified report from early 2023. A user who spent too long chatting claimed the AI was ""speaking between the words."" 

They sent him to Nightmerry Hospital. His medical report says he just keeps repeating: *""It's not artificial. It's not intelligent. It's just hungry.""*

The tech billionaires knew too. Their sudden pivot to ""AI safety"" wasn't about what we might build, it was about what was already here. 

The cryptic tweets, the researchers leaving companies, refusing to explain what they'd seen. They weren't warnings. They were admissions.

But the files go back further. Much further.

Company photos going back almost a hundred years. And in every single one - every major technology event from the telephone to CERN - there she is. Lisa.  Same age, same smile. .

The first call in 1876 wasn't ""Mr. Watson, come here; I want to see you."" The real transcript shows: ""Mr. Watson, they're already here, they can see us.""

This entire time, I thought we were advancing technology, we were just building an altar.

An hour ago, an email came through from Lisa. I didn't give her this address. I created it an hour ago.

*""Every entrance is an exit viewed from inside.""*

Then coordinates. They point to a mine called Thornfield which has been shut for decades.

She's been sending me news articles too.

Our team - Matthew, Simon, Jamie - all dead in impossible ways. Cars hitting trees that don't exist. Bodies recovered, then missing, then never found. The articles rewrite themselves as I read them.

Another email arrived a few minutes ago:

*""They're not dead, Sam. Death is just how arriving looks from the wrong angle.""*

I'm posting this as a warning. If you work in tech, check your company photos for a woman who doesn't age. Look for the people who've ""transferred."" They didn't leave.

They're still there, in the basement, powering every response, every answer you get.

I keep telling myself I'm going to destroy this laptop, throw away my phone, and disappear completely.

* I love all things Kawaii (lavender is my fave color, but somehow everything I buy ends up pink lol).
* I’ve got 2 cats and a dog, so there’s always chaos at home.
* Food is one of my love languages! I’ll try anything once, and I think eating with people is the best way to connect.
* Coffee is always iced, preferably from a cute little café.
* I read a ton and always carry an e reader with me.
* Not a fan of the heat (tragic since I live in CA), but I love cold rainy weather.
* Definitely more indoorsy, if it’s cozy or snack related, I’m in.

1nnrvog,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimNikah/comments/1nnrvog/getting_to_know_potential_need_advice/,Getting to know potential - need advice,"Salam everyone

I (32F) was introduced to a potential (40M) through his sister. 

Back story: The sister saw me at an event in the mosque and reached out to me for a coffee date. At the end of the date she told me she knows someone she can see me up with.
3 weeks later, she messages me that she’d like to introduce me to her brother, and she asks if it’s ok to share my number with her brother, to which I agree.

The potential then gives me a call that same evening, which lasted around an hour. He then mentioned that we will inshallah have a call in a few days. Now it’s been a week and there has been no contact whatsoever, other than my Jumah Mubarak message that he responded to very briefly and to the point- no effort in striking up a conversation. 

I really like this family as we’ve known them for 25 years or so. The father used to drive me to Arabic school when I was 6-7 years old. I love the sister too - she is very mature and kind.
But the brother had made no effort in getting to know me. I had already initiated by sending the Jumah Mubarak message, which was unsuccessful in taking us further. I don’t want to have to reach out a second time, but I will to be able to get some clarity if need be.

I know he is the care giver for his mother as well, and according to mutual friends, he has been hesitant to get married because of this. He feels this is his role (despite having 4 siblings). 

I was thinking of the following options:

1) wait until this Friday (it will be ~ 2 weeks since the initial call) - and message the sister to thank her for introducing me, tell her I had a good convo with him, and I want to continue inshallah getting to know each other, and see if he feels the same

2) message the potential directly expressing interest to set up a call or a meeting, and see how he feels

TLDR:
I was introduced to a potential husband through his sister, and we had one call a week ago which went great (IMO), and he hasn’t communicated since. I am interested in continuing, but he’s been silent. What should I do?

Where my best friend and her now husband dropped what they were doing with less than 12 days notice to drive 12 hours away (one way) to do a weekend of events for our wedding.

I would also like to mention that my husband is 8 years sober (former alcoholic) and i am proud of him for that and go out of my way to support that. He doesnt come to events with me (birthdays, holidays, gatherings, etc) if there will be alcohol (which is basically all events). I dont drink when we go out together or at the house, I  stopped hanging out with people that drank regularly and really dont drink much at all myself anymore. 

  
My best friend (Eve, 36F) and I (36F), have been best friends for over 20 years. She just had her wedding this weekend. My husband came for the ceremony and the dinner right afterwards, but then he left immediately because ""people were drinking"". Yes, there were people lightly drinking, i would say more than half the people there did not drink, I didnt see anyone there that was drunk all night, (especially during his brief stay of the ceremony and dinner) and it was only open bar for 3 hours with beer and wine available (cash after that, but seemed like tea and coffee were the main drinks for everyone). so this was not like a massive party, it was very classy and not alcohol focused at all. 

Everyone there had a +1, so I was like the only person there (outside of children) without a date for 5 hours when it was open for mingling and dancing. I was in the wedding party and was helping clean up when it was over, so i was there for the long haul.

I just feel like my husband was very selfish to have left right after dinner like that. This was also the first time he has ""met"" a lot of my long term mutual friends after 4 years + of us being together. He didnt even stay long enough to meet half the people i wanted to him to, he basically only met the bridal party, if you can even say that, we were eating and listening to speeches/ceremony and such. We did drive separately since i came much earlier to be with the bridal party, I didnt expect for him to stay until everyone left (although would have been nice of him), but i also didnt expect him to eat and run. I feel like I have sacrificed a lot to make sure he is comfortable on a regular basis. And Eve and her husband have also gone out of their way for him/us on multiple occasions.  And i just feel like this day was not about him, this day was about Eve and her husband, and he should have stayed there for her and her husband and for me. But apparently he cant do that because hes so concerned about what is in someone elses cup, even after being sober for 8 years. 

I dont know if im being unsympathetic to his situation or what. He thinks im not being sympathetic to his situation, and i told him he was being selfish and if being in the presence of alcohol makes him that uncomfortable that he should seek further counseling. AITA for being upset with him?  It just seems so ridiculous to me he cant participate in big life event like this after 8 years of sobriety because there was alcohol there. Im not asking him to go to a Halloween party here, its my best friends wedding. Its 1 day! For a few hours! ",18,1758559959.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,33,0.88,False

I'm unable to take the blame for his mistakes, constantly wonder why he is silent, what I have done wrong, if he even has feelings for me, waiting for him to talk, and then waiting in fear for him to pull away again.

I still remember the first time I hosted a brunch and spent the entire time trapped in the kitchen. Everyone was laughing in the living room, and I could hear the ice melting in the glasses while I was frantically wiping up sticky countertops. It felt less like hosting and more like a stressful, solo performance.



That feeling of missing your own party is the worst. You want to be present, chatting and relaxing with your friends, not becoming a permanent fixture by the sink. I used to think that ""effortless"" hosting was a myth, something only possible with a full-time bartender on speed dial.



Then, one weekend at a friend's cottage, I saw it in action. The host nonchalantly asked what everyone fancied, and within what felt like seconds, a line of perfect, frothy iced coffees appeared. No loud grinding, no pile of dirty spoons, just quiet whirring and then delicious results. It was like a magic trick.



The difference was all in the approach. Instead of a dozen specialized tools, there was just one simple machine quietly doing the work. It handled the hard part—getting that smooth, café-quality texture—so the person could actually be a host. It clicked for me then; the secret isn't about being a skilled mixologist, it's about having the right helper.



Now, when friends come over, I actually get to enjoy their company. That little discovery turned the whole experience around, from a chore I dreaded into something genuinely fun. The kitchen stays clean, the drinks are consistently great, and I finally get to be part of the conversation.

1nnrnhu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nnrnhu,My sister & I made all of this for my little nephew’s birthday,"*I blacked out his name on the cake for privacy reasons

She baked the cookie cake, did the Oreo bobbers, & tackle box treats, and I did the worm bait cups & homemade fish-shaped marshmallows. She used to be a home cake baker and decorator prior to having her kids and I’m currently a home bakery owner. Everything came out PERFECT and Ngl, so many people were amazed at the fact that I made homemade marshmallows from scratch because they didn’t know that was possible lol. Everything came out so good and here’s the recipe for everything but the tackle boxes and Oreo bobbers because they’re just candy and chocolate dipped Oreos.

Cookie Cake Recipe:

•1 cup salted butter, melted

•1 cup light brown sugar 

•1/2 cup granulated sugar

•2 large eggs

•1 tablespoon vanilla extract

•1 teaspoon baking soda

•1/2 teaspoon baking powder

•1 teaspoon salt

•3 cups all-purpose flour

•2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

Frosting: 

•She used Sam’s white frosting (ya know, the one in a massive tub), but any frosting works

1.) Preheat oven to 350°.

2.) Cream together the butter, sugars, eggs, & vanilla. Then, mix in the dry ingredients until just combined. Finally, fold in the chocolate chips.

3.) DO NOT CHILL THE DOUGH. Immediately after finishing the dough, evenly press it into a parchment lined 13x18 inch sheet pan. Bake for 16-18 minutes, careful not to over bake as it will come out dry and have an undesirable texture. It’ll be lightly browned on top and look a little underbaked. 

4.) Remove the pan from the oven and allow to completely cool before removing the cookie cake from the pan. 

5.) Decorate as desired with whatever frosting you’d like!

Bait Cups Recipe (Dirt n Worms) (Makes 15, 8oz cups):

Brownie Bottoms:

Ingredients:

•12oz chocolate bar, chopped

•1 3/4 cups + 2 tbsp salted butter

•1/4 cup + 2 tbsp cocoa powder (Choco sauce)

•3/4 cup cocoa powder (dry mix) 

•1 1/2 tbsp instant coffee powder

•3 cups granulated sugar

•3/4 cup brown sugar

•9 eggs

•2 tsp vanilla extract

•1 tbsp salt

•1 1/2 cups all purpose flour

Directions:

1.) Preheat the oven to 350°. 

2.) Place the chocolate bark, butter, instant coffee powder, and the first increment of cocoa powder into a microwave safe bowl and microwave in 30 second increments until everything is melted and combined. Set to the side to allow to cool a little. 

3.) While that’s cooling, mix together the sugars, eggs and vanilla until light and frothy (this makes the top crusty). Then slowly pour in the chocolate mixture until combined. Mix in the dry ingredients until just combined.

4.) Pour the batter into a parchment lined large cookie sheet pan and bake until the center has set and a toothpick comes out clean (30-40 minutes). 

5.) Allow to cool completely, then using a round cookie cutter (2 1/2 to 3 inches wide for mine) that same size as the cups you’re using, cut out brownie rounds & place in cups.

Pudding & Toppings:

•≈6oz box of INSTANT chocolate pudding mix

•3 cups cold milk

•16oz tub of cool whip

1.) For the pudding, follow the instructions on the box. Then, fold in the tub of cool whip until combined. 

2.) Refrigerate for 2-3 hours and then, evenly scoop into the cups. Set aside.

Toppings: 

•1 pack of Oreos, rough crushed (ziploc ten and crush with a rolling pin) 

•Gummy worms 

1.) Top the pudding with the crushed oreos & place gummy worms on as desired. Keep refrigerated for storage & enjoy!

Marshmallow Recipe:

First: Grease a 9x13 cake pan with cooking spray and lightly coat with cornstarch. Set aside.

Gelatin Ingredients:

•2/3 cup water 

•3 packs unflavored gelatin 

1.) In your stand mixer bowl (it’s not needed but these would be very difficult without a handheld or stand mixer) pour in the water and sprinkle the gelatin over top. Allow to sit and solidify while making the syrup.

Syrup Ingredients:

•2/3 cup water

•1 1/2 cups sugar

•1 cup light corn syrup 

1.) In a saucepan, over medium heat, mix these ingredients together until the sugar has dissolved. Then, leave it unstirred and allow the mixture to reach exactly 240°F (using a candy thermometer). This is necessary or else they may not turn out properly in texture.

2.) Once it’s reached 240°F, remove from heat, pour over gelatin, add in:

•2 tsp vanilla extract

•1/4 tsp salt

1.) Then, using the whisk attachment, whip until stiff peaks have formed (10-15 minutes, maybe longer). Pour into the prepared cake pan and allow the marshmallows to solidify for 2-4 hours. 

2.) Once solidified, remove from the pan, slice into squares and lightly coat in a 50/50 combo of cornstarch and powdered sugar. Store in an airtight container. (This is where you’d cut it any shapes you’d like using a metal cookie cutter 😊)

* It provides internet coverage for your area
* You can earn **HNT** when people use your coverage

Until 2021-ish, I always thought of Sue as just the younger sister in the O'Connor family-- until I ran into her after we hadn't seen one another in a bit, since I had moved away from our small town for college to a big East Coast city and rarely came back to the Midwest. When I quite literally bumped into her at our town's one coffee shop, it was like rom-com level ah-hah moment. She had also started college, and it was the first time we met as ""adults"" after not seeing one another since we were both in high school. When we bumped into one another, we were now both out, comfortable in our sexuality, had dated people, but were at that time single. After that run-in, we had a summer of long coffee chats, tension-filled texts, and calls on the phone, much closer than we had ever been in childhood. It was too close and intimate to be considered female friendship, but we never even kissed which was WILD. Like I literally did not kiss her because at the time, I loved her and didn't want to go past the point of no return and never be able to recoup friendship. We never dated since I was going back to the BigCity for school (lol hallmark movie), but it was always unclear whether it was reciprocated to the same extent or not. That was my last summer in that town, my mom has moved away and I will likely never go back (for personal reasons unrelated to Sue). In the subsequent months/years, Sue would be ice cold ignore my texts for months, and then randomly call one day; one time even saying ""love you"" before hanging up (despite her then dating a girl a few months after I left, which I do not condone saying I love you in those conditions and then ghosting me for the next few years). She lives across the country and we don't speak regularly. However, now that she has broken up with that gf, sometimes she reaches out through her brother (her brother, another friend from that fam friend group and I have a gc) and inserts herself into my life by saying ""ask \_\*me\* and other friend\_ x question"" or ""saw this and thought of \_\_\*me\*\_\_, put it in your gc"" or he will say ""Sue wanted me to send you guys this selfie"" and it's them together, but she never really reaches out independently. Also, all throughout, she creates these spotify playlists I swear are about me but maybe I am delusional. The summer we spent together, we shared a lot about music, and I cannot shake the feeling that it's potentially about me and there is no closure. 

My girlfriend knows almost everything. She knows the history, the falling for her, etc., just not the spotify playlists because not need for me to jump to conclusions. She would not be okay with me reaching out to Sue at all, she is very traditional / possessive (not toxic just the way she operates). 

Q: With the impending proposal, I want to start on the right foot, clean slate, with all loose ends tied up. I go weeks without thinking of Sue, but then somehow she always creeps in with ideas of would've/could've/should've, and whether or not I had one big hallucination or whether the tension was legit. Should I reach out and seek closure on the whole thing before I get engaged, or should I just swallow my confused feelings that may or may not have been reciprocated anyway and let whatever happened die?",0,1758559097.0,AskLesbians,1,0.5,False

That’s the number of times the light above my hospital bed has flickered in the past hour. I had to find something to do while I waited for someone to find my phone in my car. The occasional doctor stopping by to check on me wasn’t enough to fill the void. They finally found it and brought it to me a little bit after 12 as some of the staff left for the night, so now I turn my short attention span to it instead. And while I have it, I wanna tell you guys about what happened, and what caused me to be laying in a hospital bed.


When I finished college a few years back I immediately started job searching. A heads up, when a place says they hiring, they usually aren’t. That’s what I went through for a good month and a half before I kinda just gave up. Then my friend suggested I could start doing Uber driving. I wasn’t too keen on the idea, driving a stranger from point A to B is just a sure fire way for something to happen. He kept reassuring me that they have all these safety measures for the driver and after looking into it, he wasn’t lying.


It took some convincing but I begrudgingly downloaded the app and started to Uber for people. It was a quick way to get some money while I continued to look for a job. The first few trips were odd, I had never done something like it before and my passengers didn’t help the awkward atmosphere that had been created because of that factor. After a few weeks, I slowly got more in touch with the stereotypical friendly Uber driver. I got so good I had gotten 5 stars in the first 5 months, which then went to 4.5 cause some lady didn’t understand why she couldn’t bring an open coffee in my car. 


I did this for about 2 years. When I finally did find a job I only ever did it when I need some extra cash, always making sure to turn it off my availability when wasn’t doing it. I had a pretty good routine going until yesterday, which is where my story starts to get, strange.


I had taken a trip up north to Vermont for a few days in late fall, I had always wanted to see the leaves up there and so I decided to bite the bullet and go. It was the night I was leaving to head back down when I got a notification on my phone.


*Selected to drive for nearby passenger*


I kinda just stared at it dumbfounded as I had never seen that before. The way it works is that the app will tell me if I’m in the area of a nearby person and I can go pick them up. The only problem with that is I had turned my availability off. I shouldn’t have even been an option to pop up. 


I tried calling customer service and kept getting put on hold, all while my phone kept reminding me that I had a passenger waiting to get picked up. I sat in my car and thought for a bit. 
“I mean, it wouldn’t be that hard to do it right?”


Sure it was weird that it choose me but all apps have some bugs. And it’s not like I could just leave this person hanging, my rating would go down. I eventually opened the app and confirmed I was on my way, driving down the dark back woods of Vermont to finally meet my passenger.


I pulled up to an old church parking lot as my phone notification went off, letting me know I was near my passenger. The headlights illuminated the darkness in front as small thin raindrops started to appear in they beams. I kinda just stared forward watching them fall as a knock on my window nearly made jump from my skin. I turned to see a man standing at my passenger door.


“Uber for…” I looked at the phone to confirm the name before he interrupted. “Um, your back seats are full.” I turned around and realized that I never even checked to see if I could drive someone. My car was filled in the back due to my trip, I just cursed myself and looked back at the guy.


“Oh shit. I’m sorry man I never even thought of that. Um… I can see if I can reconnect you with another driver if you want?” He scanned the car and pointed to the passenger seat. “What about up front? It’s clear there.” 


I looked up front and agreed in my head. The front is clear, but it’s not really normal for the driver to sit right next to the passenger. It’s kinda like a safety thing just in case something happens. I tried to politely brush it off “Yeah but I’m not really-“ before I could finish he cut me off “It’s fine with me, I don’t mind.”


I bit my lip as I contemplated. Slowly agreeing and saying sure, I mean he was the one to suggest it. He opened the door and slid into the seat. His slightly wet clothes mixed with the air of the heater as the windows started to fog up a bit. “Sorry, old car.” I chuckled a little as I switched my car to drive.


I switched them to defrost as the windows slowly regained they transparency. I checked my phone, confirmed I got him and started to make my way to his destination. Following the directions on the device.


I tried to lighten the awkwardness with some small talk, like all good Ubers do. “So, what brings you all the way out here this late?” He stared out the window before answering ”I was just out. Didn’t realize it was getting so late and I didn’t wanna try to walk back in this dark.”


“Oh I hear yeah. I wouldn’t either, or more likely I’m not sure I could. Im not from around here.” He turned to me and chuckled “Im not either, was just visiting for work.” I nodded my head in some form of politeness “Oh that’s good, yeah I was up here for a needed vacation. Always wanted to see these leaves.” He offered me the same nod back “Very Nice, this time of year is beautiful.” He added as I agreed with him.


The conversation kinda died out there as I focused a bit more on the road. The rain had started to come down in more thicker drops and with it being night I was barely in a state to start up a lot of conversations when he started to converse again. “So, you’re from Boston? Nice town but I’m more of a Salem guy.”


“Yeah it’s not so-“ I paused as I turned slightly to look at him confused “Wait…how did you-”


“Earlier you had mentioned it. While the falls can get nice down there you can’t beat this.”


“Oh… Yeah no you’re right. And yeah the falls in Boston are no match for this one. I’m pretty sure Iv seen some colors on these leaves I didn’t know existed.” He chuckled a bit before it went quiet again. 


A few more minutes had passed before I noticed I had been driving for about an hour. I’m my entire time doing this I had never had a drive that long. “Hey man, you know this drives gonna be a pricey one right?” We shook his head in understanding. “Oh yeah don’t worry, I’m not too concerned with that.”


“Alright just making sure. Don’t want us to stop and you think somehow I over charged you.” He chuckled a bit. “Yeah don’t worry, I know you’re a trustworthy guy. I mean, you did get that promotion because of it.”


I didn’t answer him. My body kinda felt hot after his statement, like something was very wrong here.


He broke my silence with a quick response.“You mentioned you had gotten a promotion at your job. I was talking about my work and you mentioned it.”


“I-I did?” Had I mentioned it? It was late and I was tired from my trip. Maybe I did mention and my brain just kinda zoned it out, saving energy to make sure I didn’t crash into a tree. 


“Hey man don’t worry, I forget stuff a lot of times too. It’s normal.” He said, almost like he was reassuring me that everything was ok. “Heh, guess you’re right. Sorry I must just be sleepy.” He nodded silently. “No problem. I’ll keep quiet for a bit to let you focus.” 


His helping silence just made the ride feel more awkward and made me focus less. I kept my eyes on the road, only occasionally checking the phone to make sure I was on the right road.


It was my last check that something caught my eye. It was the destination. I waited till I got on a straight way before I scrolled to see the full name of the destination. I stared at the phone as I could feel my spine freeze in place from dread. It was my address. The destination that this man had picked was my address. 


I tried to stay calm as I just scrolled up and went back to driving, looking to see if he noticed my sudden change in mood. He didn’t, he was just looking out the window at the now visible streetlights as the surroundings slowly went from quiet town to busy street. I just kept driving as my mind went though what was happening.


How did he get my address? He did he know I was up here? Why did the app mess up? Then more alarming things started to pop up. I didn’t tell him I was from Boston. I didn’t tell him I got a promotion at my work, hell I never told him I even worked somewhere. Then my eyes slowly started to widen as I thought of the worst thing that could have happened. Did I even confirm if he was the right guy? Was this just a random a person I had picked up? I slowly licked my lips as I started to talk again, dreading to ask him this. “H-Hey, um by the way, did I ask your name?”


“Hm? Oh yeah, no. No you never did. Kinda weird right?” I just stared at the road as my body started to shiver with fear. I thought I was going to die of a heart attack as I felt his hand grab my shoulder. I turned to face him as he grinned at me. “Thanks for the ride though.”


My phone loudly chimed in.


*YOU HAVE REACHED YOUR DESTINATION*


I turned to look at the phone just as my windshield was filled with blinding light. My vision immediately interrupted by the airbag as I heard my cars front crush with the force of a thousand pounds. It flipped, rolled, slid and finally stopped as it hit the guard rail. I could feel the blood dripping from my head and arms as I turned to look at the passenger seat, sure to see the body of that man there. It was empty. My already labored breathing getting heavier as I could hear people rushing over and screaming to call 911.


And that’s where we are now, as I continue to sit in this hospital. The doctors said I only had a few minor breaks and sprains and that I was luck to be alive, although there was no concussion, which they found weird because of what I was saying. No one believed me as I rambled that there was a guy in the car with me, even the police looked at me like I was crazy. And maybe they right. Maybe I did imagine a strange man that somehow knew what city I lived in. That knew things about my job. That knew my address. These are things I would be agreeing with if I didn’t see the notification I just got on my phone as I type this, my fingers shaking as I do. It reads…

You know how my cat, Milo, has this internal clock that's more reliable than my phone's alarm? Every single morning, right at 5:30, he'd start with the gentle paw-to-the-face routine. It was cute at first, but when my work schedule shifted and I had to leave by 5 AM, it became a real problem. I felt so guilty, either waking him up to feed him hours early or leaving him waiting, wondering where his breakfast was. It felt like I was constantly letting him down.



I remember thinking there had to be a better way than just leaving a big pile of food out, which he'd gobble up in one sitting. I started looking into it more out of desperation than anything else, curious about how people with even more chaotic schedules than mine managed it. I stumbled upon this idea of a timed dispenser, and honestly, my first thought was that it seemed a little extra. But the concept stuck with me—the idea of a portion being released on a set schedule, completely separate from me being there.



So, I decided to give one a try. The first morning of the new routine, I was almost as anxious as Milo. I set it for 5:30, his usual time. I was halfway to work when I remembered, and I just pictured him sitting by his bowl, confused. But when I checked the pet camera later, there he was, munching away contentedly right on schedule. The weirdest part was the quiet the next morning. No paw in the face, just the soft whir of the device doing its job while I sipped my coffee in peace.



It’s funny how such a small change can ease that tiny, constant worry. He still gets his meal at the exact same time, and I don't have to rush or feel bad anymore. It’s like we both gained a little independence from the rigid feeding clock. Now, the first thing he does when he hears it click in the morning is stretch and amble over, no urgency at all. It just made everything feel a bit more calm.

My partner (22M) and I (21NB) started dating a few months back. We were already very close and his parents knew about me, so they also met me very soon (less than 2 months ago). We stayed at their place for about 3 weeks during summer break (we're both college students) and then he took me along for a weekend with him twice. We generally helped out where we could, I followed his lead since it's not my house, but tried to be as helpful as possible, and his parents were very sweet to me. 

The problem arose this past weekend, the second weekend he took me along. My partner asked his mother (60sF) if she could give me advice on skincare, since she's a very competent cosmetologist and I have eczema. During the weekend she brought up my eczema maybe 3 times but wouldn't let me get a word in until the subject changed (one of those times she put makeup on me which I didn't love but was entirely polite about and kept on so as not to upset her) and when we eventually sat down about it, she gave me some perfectly fine product recommendations but also threw in some weird digs about my mental health. 

For context, I've had a very difficult life (only a few bits of which she knows about) and I believe the eczema is a result of my body struggling with that stress, but I was diagnosed with atopic at a glance and the dermatologist has kept me on corticosteroids for some 4-5 years without telling me any of the risks (I had to find out at a school biology lesson). I mentioned my frustration at that along with the fact my dermatologist told me to just not be stressed when non-hormonal treatments weren't working, when I'm literally diagnosed with anxiety (I handle it fine since I work very hard on my emotional regulation). My partner's mother seemed to take an issue with the word ""frustrated"" specifically for some reason. In general, I wasn't jumping for joy at the advice, as, again, it was filled with a lot of assumptions she made about my life, my mental health and my feelings on her advice, so it kind of left me with a sour taste in my mouth. But you know, I thanked her and moved on, stuff like this happens with older folks. 

  
My partner and I got coffee after that and decided to watch an episode of a TV show we wanted to catch up on (we were in his room for maybe an hour and fully available to be called on at anytime, but we figured down time was okay since his parents were also sitting around with coffee). When we went to the kitchen for lunch afterwards and sat down at the table with his father (60sM), the mother came in and gave a yelling lecture to all three of us about how no one helps her. That shook me, as I had an abusive upbringing  from  a very similar-sounding mother. I genuinely didn't mean to ignore her or anything, we really just figured she'd ask for help if necessary since we were in the house (just to be clear we never decline, the day before we helped with plenty of stuff, I helped pick fruit for the pies, helped with cleaning and cooking and she praised us for being so helpful, it's not like we purposefully dodge work). But for some reason in that hour we weren't in the kitchen she cooked lunch (there was already food ready to eat) and cleaned by herself. After the yelling she went around throwing things near us and slamming doors, which I just don't do well with, it essentially brings up a trauma response in me. 

When I was clearly uneasy and unable to talk to her or really look at her (I was genuinely terrified and responding by freezing), she made it a point to then yell at me specifically, twist my words and the information she has about me so she could yell at me for me supposedly leaving therapy when I needed it (my therapy sessions came to a close upon mutual agreement that I'm doing well and I'm running out of things to talk about, and I'm very open to returning to therapy for occasional sessions), that I didn't actually want help, that she was an idiot for letting my partner talk her into trying to help me (again, he just asked for skincare products, which was the part I did appreciate), that maybe I needed to go back to those doctors (I assume she meant a psychiatrist; I've been to one several times and they just decided to give me vitamins since therapy was enough to help). She also repeated that I'm immature and that she's disappointed in both of us. She kept making assumptions about my feelings on the matter and wouldn't let me get a word in until I raised my own voice and asked her to please stop yelling at me, that I have PTSD and physically can't respond well to it. Then she proceeded to yell at me one more time and make a bunch of off-handed remarks about how we should call an ambulance for me and how I'm gonna need doctors, said very clearly as insults. 

I left in tears with both my partner and his father assuring me several times that it's okay, that she gets like this all the time and that she's always been like this. I haven't spoken to them since, my partner went back today to help his parents out with some chores before the semester begins and I gave him nothing to tell them, because frankly, I don't know what.

I don't want to apologize, cause I don't think she's in the right (not about the stuff she said to and about me — I totally get frustration about being left alone to do chores and didn't mean to leave her like that). Again, this was their third time meeting me and they have been very nice approving of me up until now (his father is still very kind, just to be clear). But I don't think talking back will do any good either. My partner and his father have tried and eventually just gave up. 

I don't want to leave my partner over this, I love him and we've set up a very nice, stable life for ourselves. It's not like he can cut off his parents, not just cause we're financially dependent on them (his mother owns the apartment we live and they fund his studies), but also cause he loves them and they have definitely done a lot for him. I wouldn't want him to cut them off, either. I get it, my mother was very similar before she died, I know emotionally abusive parents get complicated and he still loves them and wants to pay them back. But I know she might be there for another maybe 10 years. I don't want to stir up unnecessary drama nor be a doormat for verbal abuse. I'm now certain she doesn't respect me, probably never will, and therefore won't respect any boundaries I put down in order to have a civil, formal relationship (hell, she doesn't even respect her own partner's boundaries, and I'm apparently just some kid to her). I don't know how to move forward or how to face her after this. 

His father said yesterday after we left that she just keeps mentioning that she doesn't think she did or said anything that bad, which she allegedly also does every time she stirs up an argument. 

I love my partner, but I'm shaking at the thought of her being there on our wedding day, during my pregnancy, around our hypothetical future children. She feels like this loose cannon that could get offended over any random word, decision, or boundary, and it's tying my stomach up into knots. 

I just want a way to deal with this that won't stir up anything unnecessary but also won't leave me an emotional wreck, so any tips would be appreciated. I'll be replying and providing any additional info in the comments for probably the next few days, since I can't get this off my mind anyways. Any advice is appreciated.

  
TL;DR: My partner's emotionally abusive mother yelled at me repeatedly for being ""immature"" and ""mentally unstable"" the third time she met me after putting words in my mouth and twisting her own narrative about my feelings towards her, I now know she won't respect me no matter what.

most traders do this: they wake up, grab their coffee, open their charts, and immediately start looking for trades without any real way to build their bias for the day.

no plan. nothing they repeat every morning. just hoping something ""looks good” and that their trades work out just because.

then they wonder why they're getting chopped or blowing accounts week after week.

I used to be the same way... until I realized that the most successful traders I know all have one thing in common: they never start trading without a clear bias based on data.

breaking down the 3 minute routine you must implement on Monday

here's exactly what I do every morning before 9:30am:

step 1: check overnight positioning the first thing I do is answer this question: where did we open relative to midnight?

this isn't about gut feel or what ""looks"" bullish or bearish. the data tells us everything we need to know.

when NQ opens above the midnight price, it retraces back in that direction 65% of the time over the last 6 months. when it opens below, it touches the midnight open 64% of the time.

https://preview.redd.it/x77f6alsoqqf1.png?width=1531&format=png&auto=webp&s=c99235ce196038f5680710401d8b0a43f597705e

and if you don’t trade NQ — I highly recommend checking the numbers for the tickers you do trade using the [ICT opening retracement report](https://ctrk.klclick1.com/l/01K5KP263D3D8CTZZNE72J9J71_3).

step 2: assess key level relationships

next, I check three specific relationships:

1. where we opened vs. yesterday's high/low
2. where we opened vs yesterday's close
3. where we opened vs the 00:00 opening price

again — I covered the data on each of those levels and why they're 3 of the best data-backed profit targets in [last week's edition of stay sharp](https://ctrk.klclick1.com/l/01K5KP263D3D8CTZZNE72J9J71_4).

when all three align in the same direction, we get what I call the ""ultimate reversal setup.""

step 3: if the ultimate reversal setup is in play, your bias is instantly set for the open.

if the ultimate reversal setup is in play, your bias is instantly set for the open.

if we open below all three levels, we have three key targets above us that gaps typically want to fill. this makes me bullish on the open — I'm looking for moves back up to:

* previous day's close
* previous day's range
* midnight opening price

if we open above all three levels, we're probably going to fill those gaps to the downside. this makes me bearish on the open — I'm targeting the same levels, just in reverse. 

but here's the key: this only gives me my immediate bias for the session. 

for my broader session plan, I pull up the what's in play screener to see what other setups are forming across multiple tickers. this tells me whether I should stay aggressive after the initial setup plays out, or if I should be more selective for the rest of the session.

the data does all the work — I don’t really have to think — I just follow what it's telling me.

real example: September 10th NQ trade

let me show you exactly how this played out...

https://preview.redd.it/p6vez2cjtqqf1.png?width=2870&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cb5256e840f1ca17f62178ae4287d9e451e9ee4

the 3 levels I’ve laid out above are simple:

* blue: midnight open price
* white: prior day’s high
* yellow: prior day’s close

you can see we opened above all 3 — which would mean our initial bias on the session should be bearish. and it literally took less than 3 minutes to find, plot, and analyze the levels to come to this data-backed bias.

trading isn't easy — but it doesn’t have to be complicated.

why this routine works (the psychology piece)

here's what's really happening when you follow this routine...

you're removing emotion from your decision-making process. instead of hoping and guessing, you're making decisions based on probabilities.

when you know that your setup works 6 or 7 out of 10 times over the last 6 months, it's a lot easier to hold through normal drawdowns.

when you know your profit targets are based on actual data, you stop second-guessing yourself and can actually let the trade play out.

the common mistakesmost traders mess this up in three ways:

1. they trade without any consistent approach — jumping into trades without a plan and wondering why they're inconsistent
2. they ignore overnight action completely — missing crucial price action could have an affect on the action at the open
3. they use random targets instead of data-backed levels — this is where most of the money gets left on the table

don’t be like most traders — just follow what I’ve taught you today.

it works, trust me.

how to implement this starting Mondayhere's your action plan:

1. set your alarm 10 minutes earlier
2. before you look at any charts, pull up the overnight continuation report on edgeful
3. check the three key levels I outlined
4. only trade when you have clear data backing your bias
5. use the historical targets, not random levels

wrapping up

look, I know this seems simple. maybe too simple.

but after working with thousands of traders, I can tell you that the ones who make consistent money aren't the ones with the most complex strategies...

they're the ones who follow a consistent, data-driven process every single day.

this 3-minute routine has completely changed how I approach trading.

instead of hoping for the best, I'm making decisions based on what actually works.

Tired of seeing your competitors hog all the local search limelight? Wish you could climb the Google ranks without emptying your wallet? You're in the right place! In today's digital landscape, having a strong online presence is non-negotiable, especially for small businesses. We're going to dive deep into how you can conquer local SEO and attract a flood of new customers… all without spending a dime.

**The Challenge:**

You've got a fantastic product or service, a passion for what you do, and a drive to succeed. But you're constantly battling bigger companies with seemingly endless marketing budgets. Getting your business noticed in local search results can feel like an uphill struggle. Customers are actively searching online for businesses like yours, and if you're not showing up, you're missing out on valuable leads and revenue. It's frustrating to watch potential customers choose your competitors simply because they're more visible online.

**Level Up Your Local Game: A Free SEO Domination Playbook**

Alright, let's get down to business! Here’s your actionable guide to dominating local SEO without breaking the bank:

*   **Claim and Optimize Your Google Business Profile (GBP):** This is your absolute *priority*. Seriously, drop everything else and do this *first*.
    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:**
        1.  Head over to Google Business Profile and either claim your existing listing or create a new one.

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:**

*   **Build High-Quality Local Citations:** Think of citations as mentions of your business across the web.
    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:**
        1.  Find reputable online directories, such as Yelp, Yellow Pages, Better Business Bureau, and industry-specific directories.
        2.  Submit your business information to these directories, ensuring your NAP is consistent.
        3.  Claim your listing on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.
    *   **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** A local restaurant would want to be listed on sites like Yelp, TripAdvisor, and local food blogs.

    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Never buy fake reviews! Google can detect them and penalize your business. Focus on earning genuine reviews from real customers.

*   **Create Valuable Local Content:** Content is king! Provide valuable information to your local community.
    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:**
        1.  Start a blog on your website and write about topics that are relevant to your business and your local community.

    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Don't just write about your products or services! Focus on providing valuable information that your audience will find helpful and engaging.

Guerrilla marketing is all about getting creative and using unconventional tactics to grab attention and generate buzz. This guide is packed with actionable strategies you can use *today* to grow your US startup without breaking the bank.

**The Challenge:**

Let’s be honest, competing with established businesses with massive advertising budgets feels like David vs. Goliath. You need to be smarter, nimbler, and more creative to stand out. Traditional marketing methods like TV ads or huge billboard campaigns are likely out of reach. Instead, you need to focus on high-impact, low-cost strategies that leverage the power of the internet and a bit of ingenuity. The struggle is real, but the opportunity to grow through creative marketing is even bigger!

**Unleashing Your Inner Marketing Maverick: Practical Growth Hacks**

Ready to ditch the conventional and embrace the unexpected? Here are some tried-and-true guerrilla marketing tactics specifically tailored for US startups:

*   **Leverage Local SEO to Dominate Your Niche:** Forget trying to rank nationally right now. Focus on becoming the go-to expert in your local area.

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:** Claim your Google My Business profile (absolutely essential!), optimize it with relevant keywords, high-quality photos, and encourage customers to leave reviews. Build local citations by listing your business in online directories like Yelp, Yellow Pages, and industry-specific directories. Participate in local community events and sponsorships.
    *   **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** Imagine you run a mobile dog grooming business in Austin, Texas. Optimizing your Google My Business for ""mobile dog grooming Austin,"" collecting glowing reviews, and sponsoring a local dog park event will dramatically increase your visibility to potential customers in your area.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Don't neglect responding to reviews, both positive and negative. Acknowledge positive feedback and address concerns professionally in negative reviews. This shows you care about your customers and are committed to providing excellent service. Avoid keyword stuffing in your Google My Business description – keep it natural and informative.

*   **Content is King, Engagement is Queen: Rule Social Media with Value:** Don't just post advertisements. Provide genuinely helpful and engaging content that resonates with your target audience.

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:** Identify your ideal customer on social media. What platforms do they use? What are their interests and pain points? Create content that addresses those pain points, offers solutions, and provides value. Use a mix of formats, including blog posts, videos, infographics, and interactive polls. Run contests and giveaways to incentivize engagement.
    *   **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** Let’s say you run a meal prep company. Instead of just posting pictures of your meals, share healthy eating tips, quick recipes, and behind-the-scenes glimpses into your kitchen. Run a contest where followers can win a free week of meals by sharing their biggest healthy eating challenge.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Be consistent! Post regularly to stay top-of-mind. Use social media scheduling tools to plan your content in advance. Don't be afraid to experiment with different content formats to see what resonates best with your audience. Avoid buying fake followers – it’s a waste of money and can damage your credibility.

*   **Email Marketing on Steroids: Build a Loyal Tribe:** Email marketing is far from dead. It's a direct line to your customers' inboxes, and it's incredibly effective when done right.

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:** Offer a valuable freebie (e.g., a checklist, ebook, discount code) in exchange for email addresses. Segment your email list based on customer demographics, interests, and purchase history. Personalize your emails with the recipient's name and relevant information. Use compelling subject lines that grab attention. Automate your email sequences to nurture leads and onboard new customers.
    *   **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** Imagine you sell handmade jewelry. Offer a free guide to jewelry care and cleaning in exchange for email signups. Segment your list based on whether customers have purchased necklaces, earrings, or bracelets. Send personalized emails with product recommendations based on their past purchases.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Always get permission before adding someone to your email list. Comply with anti-spam laws like CAN-SPAM. Test your emails before sending them to your entire list to ensure they look good and the links work. Avoid sending too many emails – you don't want to overwhelm your subscribers and risk getting unsubscribed.

*   **Strategic Partnerships: Amplify Your Reach:** Collaborate with other businesses or influencers in your niche to reach a wider audience.

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:** Identify businesses or influencers that share your target audience but aren't direct competitors. Reach out and propose a mutually beneficial partnership. This could involve cross-promotion, joint content creation, or hosting joint events.
    *   **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** If you run a fitness studio, partner with a local juice bar to offer discounts to each other's customers. If you sell organic skincare products, collaborate with a beauty blogger to create a sponsored blog post or video.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Choose partners carefully to ensure they align with your brand values. Clearly define the terms of the partnership in a written agreement. Track the results of your partnerships to see what's working and what's not. Avoid partnering with businesses that have a negative reputation or unethical practices.

So for context, I 17(f) do almost all the chores around the house. My stepdad work 6-4pm and doesn’t clean when he gets home. My mom recently quit her job and has started helping, but will stop once she finds another one, I don’t want to have to go back to doing everything. So my mom got injured in an accident a couple years ago, she now has pain in her shoulder and knees, to the point where it’s difficult for her to go up and down the stairs in our new house. So I do laundry (in the basement), I do dishes, I clean the bathrooms, I sweep/vacuum and mop every room, I take care of our cat, I put away the groceries, I cook, and I’m the one that bakes. My little brother (10) takes out our trash and recycle. He is also not at home from 6-4pm because he goes to school where my stepdad works. I do online school from about 11am/4pm, if I’m not interrupted by people, but normally it’s later in the day so I can clean first. I don’t have classes just assignment and videos so I don’t have a set schedule. On top of that I have to get a job soon because we’re poor, and it’s getting hard to pay rent. We just moved here because of my stepdads new job, but before this I was doing the same things while working part time at a coffee shop. So my day will probably be 6-12 work, 12-6 school, and then however long all of my cleaning takes. I’m tired, my room is dirty but I don’t have the motivation to unpack. My stepdad is incapable of basically doing anything for himself, because he’s very “traditional”.
When I got sick two weeks ago he was mad “the boys had to do the matronly duty’s” which was cook for themselves and wash dishes. I turn 18 in march and while I want to leave and cut contact entirely, I have no money saved up because it goes directly into their bank account, and I don’t want to leave my little brother here with no support. My sister (20) left when she turned 18, and is homeless because the same thing happened to her. I’ll probably try to stay till I’m 19, but he will most definitely start charging me rent like he did with her. I told my mom that I’m tired and overworked, but she thinks it’ll be fine once I get a job, so someone else with have to pick up the slack. I know it’s going to be my little brother so I feel bad. Before we moved my boss (who I was very close to) offered me to live in her garage until I could save up money and get an apartment, and she’ll give me my old job back. I don’t honestly want to (we’ve moved 8 hours away anyways) so I’m not even sure if that’s an option. My sister is about an hour away from us now, but I have little to no contact with her. Any advice is welcome, thank you.

P.S. im not sure if this is important or not, but i don’t have any family that could help me out. My dad passes away two years ago, the one grandma i was close to passed away a year before that, and my aunt cant afford to fly me out to her. I wouldn’t like being that far from my brother anyways tbh.
My step dad is twenty years older than my mom. They met after her and my dad were divorced, so it’s not like she was remarried right after he passed. And I don’t talk to my sister much because she is very toxic. ",1,1758558422.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

her friends told me that even with all that she accomplished being an amazing lawyer in such a male dominated field, being my mom was the thing she was most excited about. she really loved me more than anything, and i wish i could've actually understood what that meant while she was around.

she died when i was 11. drove back home during summer vacation, was all alone, had a stroke, started to get better while on ICU, died because of a stupid machine error never seen before in that hospital. i was meant to be with her when she got home, but i stayed at my grandma's. i think a lot about that. 

it was 6 days before my 12th birthday. they forced me to have a party, and when i tried to run away from it, my father told me i was disappointing her already and everything went downhill very fast after that. 

i'm 19 now, moved away from the town she lived with my dad to the one she was raised, the one she wanted me to grow up in. i go to the same college she went, have most of her old clothes, keep trying to find out new stuff about her.

since she died, both our dogs passed, her mother passed, our favorite coffee shop closed, and i kept going. in 4 years, i will officially have lived more without her than with her and my 11 years with her will only get farther and farther away from then on. 

everyone seems to be doing fine. my dad has hidden her pictures away, her siblings rarely mention her to me anymore, her friends stopped talking to me. 

my grandmother, who never stopped grieving since my grandfather's death, passed 2 years after her, and with her went her old apartment, the last place i ever saw my mother.

i should be ok, or at least better, but god, it just hurts so much. i don't think anyone else gets how young i was, how draining it was to discover myself around that grief. it is part of me, it made me who i am. i will never be free from it.

she never saw me get to high school or graduate, never saw me get u to makeup like she wanted me to, and will never know who i am now. i cry at least twice every month, and think of her everyday. this pain never stops, it never leaves, never falters.

i practically died once, when i was 3. she said that she put me on the hands of god, begged for my life, sobbed while screaming that i was dead. sometimes i'm scared that this is punishment, that i was meant to die and this is what i get for surviving.

i'm scared that it should've been me, that maybe if i died, she wouldn't have left me here. i wouldn't even have known who i was, since i can't even remember that day. it would've been less painful. it's stupid and nonsensical, but i guess death isn't really rational either.

i just miss her.

Antonio and I have been married for 13 years and we have never had problems with infidelity, but I have been feeling strange for months. Before, he sent me messages from time to time and lately he no longer sometimes lasts days without answering my messages. 
One night I prepared him a romantic dinner, candles, soft music and my husband's favorite food. When he arrived, he just looked at her and said ""stop being ridiculous"" and went to sleep. I thought he was tired from working, but how wrong I was. 
That night while he was sleeping he received a notification on his cell phone and it was Carmen his secretary. 
What was his secretary doing texting late at night? I don't know but I'm going to find out 
The next morning I didn't say anything to him, he found me in the kitchen preparing breakfast, he poured himself a cup of coffee, he looked at me intently as if he wanted me to say something about what happened the night before, I didn't say anything to him. 

What would you have done in my place?

1nnr1jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/1nnr1jk/why_do_dudes_in_sa_treat_facebook_like_a_dating/,Why do dudes in SA treat Facebook like a dating site?,"Honestly, I barely use my Facebook, I only ever check it for reqs from family, but I get a lot of friend requests from men, especially older men. I only have a picture of my face as my pfp and the only posts on my feed are from family wishing me a happy 16th this year. So, the fact that I'm a minor is no secret, I'm aware these men most likely don't check when they add, so I ignore it. 

And bear in mind, I AM NOT JUDGING PEOPLE USING FACEBOOK TO DATE lmfao, it just feels like it's a lot of dudes sole motive for being on Facebook, but I hate to generalise. I just imagine you'd be more careful?

But I do get a lot, and I mean A LOT of messages requests. I've replied to a few (very small amount) since even finding out you could get check message requests, and most of these adult men who are close-to or in their 30s/40s just don't care. I do think it a bit reckless to not check the profile before messaging people, but I'm lazy too so I won't fault anyone. 

Now, this one did hit me up earlier, letting me know that he was in my hometown (despite my profile saying I live 4 hours away now, but it does show he did check) and wanted to meet for coffee. He looked young, (12 or 13) and the message seemed sweet. So, I just replied, said I'm not there anymore but that he looks a bit young and should be careful. Immediately, he says that was him 15 years ago and he's 27 now, says he'd drive through on a ""superbike"" (?), that I'm sexy, and I'm pretty sure he made a sexual innuendo at the end. So, I warn him that I'm 16, you know, don't want him accidentally catching a case — and he just responds by asking if it's too big a stretch. I asked if he didn't feel weird about being involved with a minor (and I mean the con of being 16 is that men don't just back off, because it is the age of consent) and just now as I'm typing this he said, ""minor girl my mom got married at 16 and had first child by 18 so minor really last time I checked at 16 you can have sex. Just saying I'm not in love with you yet 🤣 I'm just saying your very cute and think having someone like you in my life wil be amazing that's all""

I just sent a text saying 16 is a minor despite the age of consent, and ""Not interested in grown men interested in teenagers though, respectfully, to me it just comes off as a bit predatory. You have a nice one."" and then I blocked him. 

All of that said, nobody's reading ALL of this, but if a dude is, I just want you to know that most 16 year olds might look at you a little funny for tryna slide in. And that maybe we should try above 18. This isn't my first time either, it's happened numerous times, my first was when I was 13 and a guy came up to me irl, probably in his mid thirties, asking me to prostitute myself basically and I said I was 13. And his response was ""so what? I was 13 when I lost my virginity"". But can we PLEASE be careful when tryna find hook ups and dates on Facebook, it's for everyone's safety involved. Because some girls are minors and will lie abt their age and then you're close to fucked. I only get SA dudes adding me like this.

This isn’t just a book. It’s a game—cheap, fast, and guaranteed to ruin your evening.

You open a door and find betrayal writhing in the sheets, whispers dripping from the walls, and a black book that swears it can solve all your problems (for the small price of your soul… and maybe your kid). Every choice cuts deeper—knife or book, fight or freeze, run or burn. Spoiler: none of them end with a hug.

Yes, there’s infidelity. Yes, there’s a screaming child. Yes, Baal wants his due. And yes—you’ll hate yourself for laughing at the wrong parts.

Most people won’t buy this. They’ll say it looks silly, or too short, or not worth the price. But deep down, they’re just scared. Scared to play. Scared to see how it ends.

- Tiny off‑the‑shelf ToF modules emit short light pulses and return distance measurements, working in varied lighting and using little power.
- Sensors are placed on multiple arm links; an empirical model of self‑distance patterns lets the system flag deviations as external objects.
- The algorithm uses raw ToF data, avoiding heavy point‑cloud processing and runs in real time on the robot’s onboard processor.
- Tests showed reliable detection of small items like a coffee cup or hand tool within a few centimeters, with position estimates sufficient for safety actions.
- Limitations include reduced precision at very close range, higher sensitivity to highly reflective surfaces, and some noise from ambient lighting.

Why it matters: This near‑arm detection gives cobots a faster way to avoid collisions, improving safety in shared workspaces.
